    <p><p>Do you:</p>
<p>Have to wear one 12 hrs a day?
Have rosacea?
Have cystic acne?
Have oral herpes?
Have claustrophobia?</p>
<p>Were you:</p>
<p>Ever gagged against your will?
Ever gagged and raped against your will?
Ever forced to wear things that made you uncomfortable in order to appease an abuser?</p>
<p>Would you:</p>
<p>Ever consider that just because something is easy for you doesn’t mean it’s easy for everyone?
Ever consider that the experts who wrote the mandates included exemptions for a reason?</p></p>

        <p>Hit the nail on the head. You cannot enforce a mask mandate when the benefits of mask wearing are yet to be proven (and there are even studies against it)
Enforcing something because it might help is just relying on people's stupidity and compliance.</p>

        <p>Enforcing masks, makes sure social interactions become less appealing, so people go out less and spend less time meeting other people, so it works in practice, just not for the reason they're telling us. This dishonesty rubs me the wrong way and the media even misinterpret the stats (on purpose?), making it sound like they work as protection against the flu.</p>

        <p>so if we mandated n95s you'd be happier?<br>
I think the idea of cloth masks is to just reduce transmission as opposed to stop it. So a cloth mask will apparently help in some cases (e.g. someone breathes/sneezes in your general direction) because the virus particles are bigger than the gaps in the cloth so the virus will struggle to get through. <br>
You're correct that they're kinda useless in an enclosed space without ventilation because the virus will have plenty of time to seep in by the side of the mask.   </p>
<p>Worth remembering that the healthcare professionals get prevention and the general public get reduction. The message isn't "don't get sick" but rather "less of you get sick please".</p>

        <p>oh my bad. The idea is that the virus particles travel within "droplets" which are larger than the gaps in the mask. I guess it depends on whether you think the virus is airborne or not. There was actually a lot of discussion on this subject early on in hospitals around the subject of which staff got N95s and which got cloth masks. </p>
<p>I believe an N95 is still the way to go in terms of prevention and cloth masks merely a reduction.</p>

        <p>If the mandate was for fit-tested N95 masks it would at least be mechanistically consistent with the method of transmission. A mechanistic explanation still needs empirical support, of course, and there are studies in healthcare workers showing that even N95 masks did not reduce the rate of influenza transmission. That honestly surprised me, as did the studies showing that mask wearing did not reduce rates of <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01658736">post-surgical infection</a>. But, the data is what it is. As it stands now, the mask mandates are clearly more about compliance and security theatre than any sincere desire to reduce viral transmission. If politicians actually cared about the health of the electorate they would be banned cigarettes, processed foods, and vegetable oils, not mandating the closure of gyms and obstruction of the airways.</p>

        <p>I think you're misunderstanding the stakeholders in this theatre. 
Nobody cares about people but politicians do care about electors and that's our proxy for caring about people. If the ballot box was at the top of a climbing rope then they might care about gyms but it isn't so they're not (on average). <br>
Politicians want to get re-elected so they wish to avoid lockdowns because they're economically damaging but health officials are pestering politicians about the figures they're seeing (infection or hospital admission rates). This leaves politicians in an awkward spot where they don't want to be considered as responsible (in the next election) for more people dying than necessary but they also don't want to lockdown.  </p>
<p>So this plays out much like one would expect where we often end up in this situation where politicians leave everything until the last moment and by the time they feel forced to lockdown its already "too late" according to the science people running the models (who, lets not forget don't have to care about re-election so will likely tend towards over-representing the danger).  </p>
<p>IMO the masks are a combination of various factors, theatre ("we have to do something", and it probably does reduce transmission a little but not a lot) the rationing of N95s for healthcare workers (as opposed to the public because if the public all tried to get N95s in March there would have been further chaos) as well as an attempt to reduce transmission in asymptomatic individuals by hoping they get into the habit of masking up so when they are contagious, their spread is lessened.</p>

        <p>Yours is a plausible incentive-based analysis from the mainstream perspective, but it leaves out several key players who are also incentivized to maximize their interests through covid response. Note that a shared incentive to undertake illegal or immoral action is all that is required for conspiracy. </p>
<p>With that in mind, look at the profits the billionaire class has been making: https://newrepublic.com/article/157634/billionaires-eating-economy</p>
<p>US billionaires increased their net worth by 10% in a 3-week span in March and April (what about the previous three weeks? What about the subsequent months?)</p>
<p>Meanwhile US national debt has increased by 2 trillion dollars, and the federal reserve has put trillions on its balance sheet as well:
https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_recenttrends.htm https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/government-debt</p>
<p>The situation is the same in Canada. Canada's national debt was $765 billion in March of 2020 is expected to hit $1.2 trillion by March of 2021.</p>
<p>https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/bill-morneau-fiscal-update-budget-deficit-1.5641864</p>
<p>The interest on this debt is paid by the taxpayer to international banks like the World Bank and the IMF (in the 70's under Pierre Trudeau Canada stopped borrowing at no interest from the Bank of Canada, and began borrow <em>at interest</em> from the global central banks.) Our children and grand children will be stuck paying off this debt.</p>
<p>Watch this video on the World Economic Forum's 'Great Reset': https://www.corbettreport.com/greatreset/</p>
<p>It's an out-in-the-open conspiracy to charge the world drastically. This is their own website article: https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/shopping-i-can-t-really-remember-what-that-is/</p>
<p>It is literally titled "Welcome to 2030. I own nothing, have no privacy, and life has never been better." Does that sound like a benign agenda?</p>

        <p>Pre Covid science on masks was very clear on how they don't work. From: https://www.rcreader.com/commentary/masks-dont-work-covid-a-review-of-science-relevant-to-covide-19-social-policy</p>
<h6></h6>
<p>Review of the Medical Literature Here are key anchor points to the extensive scientific literature that establishes that wearing surgical masks and respirators (e.g., “N95”) does not reduce the risk of contracting a verified illness:</p>
<p>Jacobs, J. L. et al. (2009) “Use of surgical face masks to reduce the incidence of the common cold among health care workers in Japan: A randomized controlled trial,” American Journal of Infection Control, Volume 37, Issue 5, 417 – 419. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19216002</p>
<p>N95-masked health-care workers (HCW) were significantly more likely to experience headaches. Face mask use in HCW was not demonstrated to provide benefit in terms of cold symptoms or getting colds.</p>
<p>Cowling, B. et al. (2010) “Face masks to prevent transmission of influenza virus: A systematic review,” Epidemiology and Infection, 138(4), 449-456. https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-infection/article/face-masks-to-prevent-transmission-of-influenza-virus-a-systematic- review/64D368496EBDE0AFCC6639CCC9D8BC05</p>
<p>None of the studies reviewed showed a benefit from wearing a mask, in either HCW or community members in households (H). See summary Tables 1 and 2 therein.</p>
<p>bin-Reza et al. (2012) “The use of masks and respirators to prevent transmission of influenza: a systematic review of the scientific evidence,” Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 6(4), 257–267. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00307.x</p>
<p>“There were 17 eligible studies. … None of the studies established a conclusive relationship between mask/respirator use and protection against influenza infection.”</p>

<p>“We identified six clinical studies … .

<p>“A total of six RCTs involving 9,171 participants were included. There were no statistically significant differences in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza, laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections, laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, and influenza-like illness using N95 respirators and surgical masks. Meta-analysis indicated a protective effect of N95 respirators against laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonization (RR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.43-0.78). The use of N95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza.”</p>

<p>Finally, there's real time data showing masks didn't help shit in latest outbreak. There are countries in EU for example that had mandatory masks in summer. And their positive covid cases just went up like crazy. Nothing in the data that shows their efficiency. I think masks are even dangerous.Provide false sense of security. Oh and nobody wears them as they should!</p>

        <p>uhhhhh, I read one of those papers and it didn't say what you're saying. The argument there was about the virus remaining on the surface of the mask and mostly asking the question about efficacy versus N95s as opposed to efficacy versus no protection, so you're misrepresenting those papers.<br>
I read another one whose sample size ended up being too small (only two transmissions) so the study states another larger study needs to be run to prove anything but you're not letting that stop you.<br>
Have you read these papers at all?</p>
<p>I believe the point remains that the desire isn't protection (that would be an n95) but merely a reduction in transmission and I believe it may well be possible that masks achieve that.   </p>
<p>&rt; I think masks are even dangerous.</p>
<p>Ye but unlike the science you're mis-quoting you're just making that shit up. You have an interesting point but I don't think you're making it very well.</p>

        <p>There is one , done by Danish researches. I guess results aren't pro-mask so they don't want to publish it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/top-scientific-journals-reject-controversial-danish-study-on-effectiveness-of-face-masks-against-coronavirus-report">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/top-scientific-journals-reject-controversial-danish-study-on-effectiveness-of-face-masks-against-coronavirus-report</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><em>As of Oct. 21, that study has yet to be published, and one of the  researchers on the study, Thomas Lars Benfield, recently said that the  findings would be released “as soon as a journal is brave enough,”  suggesting that the results would cause controversy.</em></p>
<p><em>Benfield has since walked back those comments, saying, "The  quote [is] a bit out of context. The article is being reviewed by a  respected journal. We have decided not to publish data until the article  has been accepted."</em></p>
<p><em>However, Torp-Pedersen agreed with Benfield's initial comment, saying that he "might also have dared to go as far as Benfield.”</em></p>
<p><em>"That's how I want to interpret it, too,” Torp-Pedersen  responded when asked if the rejection by the journals means the results  are "controversial" to some.</em> </p>
<p><em>“Can one interpret a controversial research result in the  sense that no significant effect of mask use is demonstrated in your  study?” Torp-Pedersen was asked.</em> </p>
<p><em>"I think that's a very relevant question you are asking,” he responded.</em></p>

        <p>Yes. When I say things I say them softly. As opposed to our OP which I remind you said:  </p>
<p>&rt;  No real expert would ever write a mask mandate. Ever</p>
<p>Which is a very strong statement and backed it up with zero evidence. This unsourced statement is what I'm attacking and how I'm attacking it is <em>perfectly</em> fair, especially when people lie that papers they link defend that position when they clearly don't.  </p>
<p>&rt;  Shouldn't the burden of proof and data be on the person dictating we all need to wear masks all the time? </p>
<p>and I'm not dictating shit, I'm merely calling into question the statement that:  </p>
<p>&rt; no real expert would ever write a mask mandate   </p>
<p>I think there are reasons why that is not true and there are reasons why advisors to governments would suggest people wear cloth masks because they believe it may reduce the transmission of the virus in certain conditions (but possibly not others). <br>
Given that the advisee's job is to "manage" the pandemic as opposed to fix it, I think its reasonable that they'd suggest the population wear cloth masks and maybe even be advised by scientific advisors to do so.  </p>
<p>I don't think that's a particularly radical position to hold, its just not in tune with the circlejerk on here.</p>

        <p>you might notice how the smoke doesn't go straight forward though. So if he's talking directly to someone else outside or in a room with good ventilation then their expose to virus particles will be reduced.  </p>
<p>Also there's a misunderstanding here. Its not supposed to provide perfect protection, its supposed to reduce transmission events versus no mask at all.</p>

        <p>Masks were first introduced in the medical scene to stop bacteria from doctor's coughs and sneezes infecting open wounds during surgery. Bacteria particles are much larger than virus particles and were therefore caught by <em>medical grade</em> masks. There is still too little evidence to enforce a strict mandate, as the virus particles travel through aerosols which go through the mask. Those that travel on saliva will end up on the other person's mask and while you might say that masks could help here, what do you think happens when you touch your mask to take it off? Masks can be bad for you if worn for long hours which retail workers and other workers, and even school children (who couldn't be further from the at risk category) have to do, and have a detrimental effect on social interaction, so with little evidence (which is shaky in itself) a mandate just isn't justified.</p>

<p>I totally agree that its possible that a large amount of mask usage by the general public is entirety ineffective because of poor hygiene practices. However these poor hygiene practices just increase the likelihood of someone catching it themselves, the idea is that its still supposed to decrease the chance of giving it to someone else.</p>

        <p>Yeah I know, but nearly everyone has poor hygiene practices when it comes to masks. It causes us to touch our faces all the time, and we sneeze on them and breathe through that, and so the list goes on. The whole "it's to protect other people" just seems to be their reason to make everyone wear them instead of those who feel they need protected. Idk, the evidence is just too shaky. A recommendation? Okay. A mandate? Absolutely not.</p>

        <p>Should be a human right everywhere to wear what you want imo.</p>
<p>As long as you aren't walking through a preschool wearing a shirt with super explicit rap lyrics on it nobody has any business telling you what to wear.</p>
<p>Technically masks are required at the store I work at, for customers. If they make it to the checkout and apologize and offer to go get their mask I tell them that is absolutely 100% unnecessary, and not to wear it unless they want to.</p>
<p>Want to wear a mask? Go ahead, during halloween it's a fashion thing. But try to force everyone to wear one and it just shows what a controlling buffoon you are.</p>
<p>Ffs I get horrific social anxiety and panic attacks, and even I'm still going out acting like a normal person. Because a mask isn't going to cause a virus to vanish, or even slow the spread - and even if it did, simply delaying the inevitable</p>

        <p>Okay, maybe it's a shirt that says "I want to have intercourse with these children"</p>
<p>That better? You know what I meant man haha. It doesn't matter, that would just be common decency imo. I wouldn't walk into a church with a t-shirt that says "god is dead" even if it's in a foreign language, but that's just etiquette.</p>
<p>If you want to do that go ahead, I just don't think that's a good idea lol. Also me and a couple of my friends could read simpler passages back in preschool, that's a bit of a generalization.</p>

        <p>And right here is the delicate balance we must always maintain between individual liberties and the freedom of businesses to impose rules inside their private establishments.</p>
<p>If a store owner wants to mandate masks inside their business that is their right to do so, as misguided as it may be. I do not see it as any different than requiring shoes and a shirt. Their building, their rules. And I should have the freedom to choose to do business elsewhere at one of their competitors that does not require masks to be worn. </p>
<p>My problem is when the government mandates with whom and how a private business chooses their customers.</p>
<p>If I go into a store, they tell me to put a mask on or leave and I refuse both then I am trespassing. But for me to be okay with that the rule has to come from a choice the business owner made, not one out of fear that the government will come in and shut them down for it.</p>
<p>And all this being said, I will absolutely never take out my frustrations over masks and all this other bullshit on a business owner just trying to do what they can to stay in business.</p>

        <p>These are valid points. It is difficult for some to actually wear a mask. And I have sympathy for people who fall into this category. But I don’t think that should be our focus. This is about personal freedoms and a bigger agenda. There have been numerous studies showing masks don’t even work. Even if they did, Covid doesn’t warrant mask wearing, especially by force on healthy people. Wearing a mask might be an inconvenience for most people, it is terribly hard for people who have gone through trauma or who have sensory issues. But it’s not really about masks. It’s about the new normal, one world gov coming our way.</p>

<p>They are finding out now that yes, just like the anti-mask people said when you wear a mask you suck in more CO2 back from breathing out and in than you did without a mask.</p>
<p>Sometimes 50% more if the mask fits tight enough.</p>

        <p>It's about rational thinking to me. The virtue signaling over masks is so intense that people now think wearing one makes otherwise unsafe exposures somehow safe. </p>
<p>What medical professionals have actually said is that masks are a last resort which MAY help in cases where exposure to others is impossible to avoid. The left now treats them like covid crucifixes used to ward away viral particles. It's utterly superstitious.</p>

        <p>Are people going to mass gathering in Europe and saying it's totally fine and will not spread covid simply because they're wearing masks? Because that's what people are doing here.

        <p>In a way it is about the masks because they are symbolic of all that as well. Not to mention being denied service for not wearing one, especially for things like food, or people being overly policing and snitching about them, can lead to quite startling and frightening situations.</p>

        <p>It’s actually hard to find studies that I used to have as they are consistently being removed for not being appropriate in today’s society (not fitting the narrative), but here’s one that has links to some other relevant research even though it’s in a dental setting: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200605090916/https://www.oralhealthgroup.com/features/face-masks-dont-work-revealing-review/">2016 study</a></p>
<p>The more tedious strategy is to read some of the articles that people have posted detailing that facemasks do work and realize that the results are almost never statistically significant and the researchers usually just say “it’s likely that they provide some protection.”</p>
<p>Or the easiest thing to do is look at the side of a new box of commonly worn masks where it almost always explicitly states, “this product is not a respirator and will not provide any protection against COVID-19”</p>

        <p>While I applaud both of you for sending articles, while I looked through the articles I couldn’t help but see little to no statistical evidence in either direction for or against face coverings. While information on face masks is fairly limited such as studies, both articles did say that cloth masks can be used to prevent droplets from leaving the body. In the end your articles are shaky at best in terms of reliability</p>

        <p>Well that’s the key isn’t it? It is the job of scientists to verify the effectiveness of treatments. The burden of proof is on science to verify that something works. If I just spout “COVID can’t be transmitted if we’re both wearing gold amulets around our necks” and it is just as statistically significant as masks are, would you start wearing a gold amulet instead of a mask?</p>

        <p>I wear a mask because there is more a chance that it works than it doesn’t. The idea that a mask is just there to control you is some serious conspiracy bs. Below are some articles that I found that say masks work. Notice how they do not use YouTube videos as references and they have studies with procedures outlined.

        <p>There are many articles/studies showing masks work and don’t work. I couldn’t give a rats behind if masks work or not. The fact is covid isn’t nearly as deadly as those in power want us to believe. I’m not the least bit concerned about getting a fever and sore throat. If I’m sick, I will stay home. I won’t go to visit an elderly loved one. I won’t go to work. That’s how illness with a .004% survival rate are handled. You may think it’s a conspiracy but I believe this virus was created to kill millions of people. It was going to kill millions, everyone would be afraid, rightfully so, and the leaders around the world would gain more power and set up a one world gov. It didn’t work but they had to keep up the narrative and fear. So they mandate masks and distancing. They close businesses. Now some countries require you to ask for permission to leave your house. Are you kidding me?!? Because of a fever and cough? There’s no way this is a conspiracy in my opinion.</p>

        <p>Really my frustration isn’t about whether masks work or not. It’s that we are being forced to wear one. I can think for myself. Tell me the symptoms and death rate. I am an adult and can decide how I want to handle it. If I don’t want to wear a mask, great. If you do want to wear a mask, great. I don’t care. Wear a hazmat suit. Don’t care! I want to be treated like an adult.</p>

        <p>I wanted to first thank you for being civil and providing links, that's rare on Reddit these days.</p>
<p>I went through each of your links and had some thoughts about them that I spent 30 minutes last night typing out before my phone died. It's a bummer but here's the long and short of it:</p>
<p>Your first link's supporting evidence consists of an experiment where researchers are looking for droplets in the 20-500 micrometer range while people are talking. Masks are a reasonable tool for helping to dissipate very large droplets like these, but what about smaller droplets and the much smaller <a href="https://first10em.com/aerosols-droplets-and-airborne-spread/">aerosols</a>? This article actually goes more in depth about the difference and is an example of someone who believes masks are useful in quelling some of the spread of viruses (see, I don't ignore research that doesn't back up my point). </p>
<p>The second experiment discussed in your first link is a good research study which again goes into the difference between droplets and aerosols, but I'd like to hit home on this section really quick: 
&rt; "A subset of participants (72 of 246, 29%) did not cough at all during at least one exhaled breath collection, including 37 of 147 (25%) during the without-mask and 42 of 148 (28%) during the with-mask breath collection. In the subset for coronavirus (n = 4), we did not detect any virus in respiratory droplets or aerosols from any participants." </p>
<p>Basically if you are coughing, sneezing or otherwise symptomatic, wear a mask. This is common decency and I'd like to think that most people would just stay home when actually sick. </p>
<p>Then there is "evidence" based on locations that implemented mask policy, which is not only terrible evidence but also easily cherry picked and refuted by looking at other locations where the policies did not help. The final evidence in that first link is pretty much all anecdotal so I'm gonna leave that alone because it doesn't belong here.</p>
<p>The second link is a study comparing the effectiveness of one type of mask to another and doesn't have a control group without a mask, so it's not really appropriate literature for this discussion.</p>
<p>The third link is a CDC FAQ page which has no links to mask studies that I could find, but does contain this glorious quote which seems a bit shortsighted nowadays considering I believe there is no longer a PPE shortage and you would think they'd want to push what most people consider "the most effective" masks on everyone:
&rt; The masks recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators. Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.</p>
<p>The fourth link is a response to a study showing the ineffectiveness of cloth masks (again hilarious in response to the CDC) in "high-risk situations." The evidence presented is actually all the same articles as in the first study which I've talked about already. This study it's refuting is one of the ones that points out that cloth masks may actually increase the chance of infection from certain viruses, but it's again not statistically significant data so we can't make any assumptions from it.</p>
<p>In the end, you may be right. Masks, even cloth masks, might help control the spread of COVID-19 but I still haven't seen any evidence that I would consider remotely definitive on the subject. The fact that people are acting like masking is a panacea and anyone who doesn't do it is a selfish asshole who wants everyone to die is extremely disconcerting given the body of evidence at play. </p>
<p>Hell, I wore a mask for a while near the beginning of this whole thing before I started doing research and my governor decided it was ok for him to decide what I should do with my own body.</p>

        <p>Regardless of if they work, they don't work <em>enough</em> to enforce a mandate. They should be a choice. Also, they probably link to YouTube because the government can't cover every YouTuber up but they can stop the mainstream media from sharing information they don't want out there.</p>

        <p>Hello, autistic person here. </p>
<p>Masks trigger certain sensory issues that I have. If I am anxious while wearing one, it can trigger an anxiety attack that will take hours to recover. With the exception of work, which thankfully is in an office so it is loosely enforced, I stopped wearing one. Thankfully I live in a state that leans red so even though there are signs on business entrances, there are many businesses that do not enforce them. But it sucks feeling even more isolated now or having that one employee deny you business over your medical conditions.</p>

<p>I've watched them all regress into old habits that took years of slow acclimation to social environments to overcome. All wiped away in eight months...

        <p>I feel a certain relief 'someone gets it', but not nearly as much as I am sorry you had to experience that!</p>
<p>This is what people don't understand about a lot, if not all -can only speak directly for panic disorder and OCD- anxiety disorders. They are not an emotion like 'anxiety' in the sense of 'worry'. It's much more a physiological thing that just happens to you, although, as with physical conditions, you can do things to manage it. The stuff that looks emotional from the outside is because anyone who experiences something that intense is going to be inclined to react to it.</p>

Edit: To be clear, the respirator is not “due to covid”, I work with carbon fiber.</p>

        <p>I worked in the asbestos industry and the PPE we required for particles 100's of times larger than a virus was by far 10's times that of even their sacred N95 never mind cloth.</p>
<p>I asked a pro masker in another sub it they would wear a cloth mask if there was chance to being exposed to anthrax...First answer was No, but then changed it to Yes, if he had no other choice.. I provided all the data showing that wearing a cloth mask in an anthrax environment would make you a dead man walking and that COVID is a fraction of this size, but he still managed to find a way to rationalize it to himself...this is the level of reason were' up against.</p>

<p>These are two studies that are actually the most favorable results for cloth masks.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7185834/
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108646/</p>
<p>Now what these studies don't account for is prolonged exposure, the direct inhalation or expelling of particles and the reduction in effectives over a duration once contaminated.</p>
<p>So  based on the results, the average cloth mask will capture about 50% of particles, depending on size. The question is will stopping 50% of particles prevent positioning.. No, and the longer the captured particles are on your mask while your working the higher the probability of forced inhalation.  In the example of anthrax if you are exposed to 20,000 spores and therefore the mask captures 10,000,,guess what? you're pretty much dead without immediate medial treatment. And really like pathogen, the number of particles required to cause infection, poisoning varies greatly depending on health conditions and the more compromised your health the more susceptible you are therefore far fewer particles are required. For anthrax this could be as little as just a few spores...</p>
<p>The claim that masks work, well when you realize that they only stop a percentage of particles, then one can realize that unless specifically designed (such as the respirator i wore in asbestos removal where we were required to change the filters on frequent intervals), that there benefit only comes from very limited exposure, in which the mask is changed immediately after suspected contamination but this still does not guarantee positive benefits. Remember it's an average, in one case it could stop 100% but in another 0%, therefore the average is 50% lol.. Comparing to COVID or any other virus, you could slow the spread slightly, if you also wear goggles, rubber gloves and use a decontamination process for your clothes and PPE before entering n area where you will remove the PPE. And of course frequent changing of the mask is required. But slowing the spread is counterproductive anyways because it's not being stopped.</p>

        <p>I wore a respirator and a full Tyvek suit while removing popcorn from my ceiling. After about twenty minutes of wearing it, I felt like I was going to die; yet I was wearing filters rated to protect against asbestos which is proven to give lung cancer or mesothelioma.</p>
<p>So many studies have proven that cloth masks are little more than a talisman and that Commievirus has both a high (20-33%) rate of asymptomatic infection and low (way less than 1% for anyone under 65) fatality rate. Yes, part of the reason why I don't wear the mask is because it's uncomfortable, but the greater reason is that I don't want to participate in this farce.</p>

        <p>A couple things. Do these people wear them at home around the most LOVED people in their life? (no, they don’t). Why not? Asymptomatic spread right!? But a chance passing in the grocery store by someone not wearing one is “AHHH COVID!” Get outta here with that shit. They’ve been told that it’s the thing to do without thinking through it. It’s a symbol of rule following for them. If there was a red light these people could put on their head for donating to charity, they wouldn’t hesitate to turn it on nice and bright. Also, they thumb their nose and millions of years of evolution. Don’t you think we would’ve evolved with a nice covering of skin over our mouthes and noses like an uncircumcised penis? I tend to be more religions so I trust the way God made my body. I have something better than a mask. It’s called an immune system.</p>

        <p>Those who think a random store clerk or fellow customer has the right to badger someone who claims a medical exemption from wearing a mask are callous monsters.</p>
<p>Those who think that that person should have to discuss their private medical history with a stranger, in public, are bullies who revel in the degradation of others.</p>

All day long it was: Climb the ladder, open a ceiling tile, draw what I saw, put the ceiling tile back, step down the ladder, move the ladder, repeat.... All day long with a fucking mask on.

        <p>Me too. I can go maybe 5 minutes before I start feeling like I'm going to pass out, which starts me panicking. I also have a phobia about having cloth near my mouth, weird I guess but I've had that since childhood. So having the mask near my mouth keeps making me gag. So the whole time I'm wearing one I'm feeling faint, gagging, and panicking. It's an absolute nightmare and I avoid it as much as possible.</p>

        <p>I actually thought that masks were an inconvenience at first but after wearing masks for a while, I've had a sense of inferiority for some reason at times while wearing them. The feeling of inferiority is related to my breathing being restricted. Lately I've now been getting headaches after wearing them for a while.</p>

        <p>Yeah, keeping your spirits up and feeling confident in your own body is far more important than avoiding a 0.0002% chance at death by spit, Im more likely to get hit by a car while I ride my bicycle, everyone says it's unsafe to do so, but I ride with headphones because fuck me I like music and exercise. I endanger myself with that, but guess what? I never get hit by a car because I mind my surroundings, I got hit more before I was wearing a headphone, now that isn't to say headphones make it safer, You yourself make it safe or not by being vigilant. I trust in myself to handle things, why the fuck should I let people tell me where to put my faith in?</p>

        <p>I consider them a relatively minor inconvenience but I have to admit you raise some really good points. They do bother me but not nearly as much as other parts of the new normal.</p>
<p>I think our side makes a tactical error by focusing on masks too much though. I wear one as little as possible because of the symbolism, but I try to focus my conversations with people on other negative aspects of the new normal. Mostly the economic effects and effects on individual liberty. We hsve so many strong points against lockdowns/border closures/economic restrictions that I think we need to emphasize those.</p>
<p>When we get bogged down on masks it can hurt the overall cause. They have some good points and we have some good points. When we can focus the conversation on how relatively benign this virus is and how destructive lockdowns are we have a much stronger position.</p>
<p>I'll definitely raise some of your points when the conversation does turn to masks though.</p>

<li>Most work is outside the home. We log, we fish, we feed and herd cattle, we drive truck, we haul, we service the electrical, plumbing, and HVAC in buildings that <em>arent</em> our homes. We fix roofs and pave roads. We work at steel mills and power plants. We work in coal mines and factories and warehouses. What we do ensures that when you flip a switch the lights come on, and when you go to the store there’s food on the shelves. Just because <em>you</em> spend all day working on a little computer in your living room, that does not mean that “most work” is like that.</li>

Are libraries and museums essential? Or could we get by illiterate and uncultured?

        <p>According to the experts who wrote the mandates, no, they are not required to stay home. Asking a claustrophobic, or anyone for that matter, to stay inside for 9 months without an end date is cruel and unhealthy. Even prisoners get time in the yard to socialize. Go take your draconian fantasy bull shit somewhere else.</p>

        <p>Terrible analogy. About 1/3 of Americans are at risk due to underlying conditions (ages 18-60). Thats nearly 100 million people. So should everyone wear a mask to help them out? YES. Your analogy is terrible because you’re comparing feet to a virus. Can 1/3 of Americans survive without feet? Yes. Can those 1/3 of Americans survive a virus that’s fatal to them? Possible but they would have a serious illness after they fought off the virus. And your too selfish to care about those people. Don’t get me wrong I feel bad for people what can’t wear a mask because it negatively affects them. But people ruin it by making fake cards stating they don’t have to wear a mask because they have a fake condition they are not required to tell you. And according to you guys we should only care about the people who suffered because of a mask and lockdowns.

        <p>You’re too selfish to care about the secondary effects that these measures are having. You’re too selfish to care about the increase in child abuse and trafficking, in the increases in women and young girls trapped in the sex trade, increases in suicide, increases in addiction, increases in overdose, disruption to children’s education, increases in hunger and starvation, increases in homelessness and poverty, increases in pain and suffering in so many other areas of life outside coronavirus. You’re too damn selfish and busy virtue signaling like coronavirus is the only problem I the world, and that masks (and not distancing, hygiene, hand washing, weight loss, diet, exercise, good sleep and health routines) are the only end all be all of disease prevention. They aren’t. When people are forced to protect others, it only foments resentment. Why would anyone want to protect someone who would guilt, shame and threaten them with consequences for not doing it?</p>

        <p>I agree those are terrible things. But, instead of finding why these things are happening you just blame lockdowns and mask. There was an article posted here about a man killing his children due to “lockdowns”. But if you actually read the article he had severe depression and he would have have killed the children anyway regardless of the lockdowns. Another issue is child abuse. Terrible thing. During these lockdowns we were able to find these crimes pmore often because of online schools. Online school is bad and good. We can find abuse quicker but online school makes it harder to learn for children. And for the poverty Trump wasn’t doing much to help them. Most of you guys here are pro trump so why do you guys care about poor people? When something is done to help them it’s called communism.</p>

<p>This is a blatant lie. Reports to Children and Youth are down 50% and that’s not because the abuse is down 50%, it’s because the children are not being seen and their abuse isn’t being reported. </p>
<p>You should be ashamed of lying about child abuse.</p>

        <p>Yeah use valrex or abreva or whatever works for you. But the trick is to touch it as little as possible and not let fabric or other things rub against it. You want it to dry up so it doesn’t weep and spread. Good luck!</p>

        <p>I guess it’s not that nice if you have claustrophobia, or have some sort of anxiety problem. But physically, it shouldn’t hinder breathing at all. You get the same amount of oxygen with a mask on or off. </p>
<p>Although I personally don’t wear one in the gym, when performing my sets, the mask slowly goes into my eyes. Which is very irritating. Although there’s probably a mask out there that’ll fit better.</p>

        <p>Sure. The mask density is dense enough to block for ex saliva droplets from breathing, but it’s not dense enough to block O2 or CO2 for ex. </p>
<p>This is the result of a lot of scientific research for ex:
https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1513/AnnalsATS.202007-812RL</p>
<p>Although this doesn’t mean masks can be 100% effective against COVID-19. Particularly because a percentage of people don’t correctly use masks (they touch their masks for ex), we don’t 100% know the effect it has on the spread of COVID-19. And it could give people a false sense of security, which would mean they would social distance less. But it’s clear that masks don’t reduce your ability to breath.</p>

        <p>So you are saying that if air that usually enters the gaping hole that is your mouth or nose holes, now has a piece of cloth in front of it with holes big enough for air, but too small for water, and that air now has to trough the tiny holes before it gets to you, there is no restriction whatsoever?

        <p>The holes are wide enough for oxygen to go trough, but the oxygen doesn't have to go trough... Youre making a point and disregarding the point instantly, how many hoops do you have to jump trough to finish a sentence in day to day conversation?, alright imagine a river, now imagine a dam stops the river, Now I poke a million tiny holes in the dam but it's still there, Its like swiss cheese. Will the water go trough at the same pace? Imagine the holes are as big as needs to be just for the water molecule to go trough, same principle as masks. Does the water flow the same as if the dam wasnt there? The answer should be obvious but please indulge me</p>

        <p>Really? When I said the air doesn't "trough" through, I wasn't saying that the oxygen doesn't have to go through the mask. I was pointing out that you earlier said that oxygen has to "trough" the mask, implying that it has to push through the fabric, when that's not really the case. I was quoting you. Hence the quotation marks.
I gave you the straight facts. The oxygen molecules are smaller than the holes in the mask, but the virus is not. No hoops have to be jumped for that sentence.</p>

        <p>You didn't answer my question but that is fine, say the hole is larger than the water molecule, will the water still flow the same trough the dam? The answer is of course not because it first has to pass trough the fucking hole. A medical N50 or whatever, and still, more than 200 families of frontline NHS workers who died from Covid-19 will receive £60,000 bereavement payments from the government. Figures released exclusively to PoliticsHome show 236 claims have been received, with 205 accepted for payment so far. However, many families are yet to claim this payment and the DHSC said they are writing to employers asking them to contact families. An estimated 620 frontline healthcare workers in England and Wales have died from Covid-19. Do you think they didn't wear masks? Do you think they didn't sanitize? This is to make the point they are useless, to make the point that you get less air, try breathing trough a straw, do you get the same amount of air? Now try breathing trough 10? Is it still the same amount of air? No you fucking idiot because the air has to go trough something, that is the point of a mask to filter the air, the reason people don't wear masks all the time is because you simply get less air. Masks are good for dust and fouls smells, nothing more.</p>

        <p>Your question isn't entirely logical. You are not getting any less oxygen when you wear a mask. It only feels that way because 1. Other things in the air are pushing against the mask, and 2. Your breathing patterns change when you wear the mask. You're also breathing more consciously.</p>

        <p>It's fine, It's fine sure, my question isn't entirely logical that is a perfectly reasonable response, you could also say, no sir I do not know the answer, Or no I will research this or no you're wrong and here is why. But you can't because, I'm right and you're not wrong, these aren't my findings against yours, it's what you have been told against what I have found out. Masks restrict the airflow, but oxygen can pass trough the masks the holes are big enough you say, yes, but it still has to pass trough the holes, since the holes are there to filter the oxygen you simply get less oxygen, It's such simple logic and people have known this for forever until people like you came along, people who you could tell the earth is flat, because if I lay this 2 meter long ruler on the ground it does not bend and because it doesn't bend means this is a flat surface and not a round one, that is the level of logic. So in the end you still think 2+2=5 and you are simply wrong, you can find many studies and videos of doctors profing the oxygen levens are the same with funny tests and practical videos. But in the end we aren't the equipment they use for the tests, we are people, 90% of us are right handed, 10% of us are left handed. Why? Well I do not know but I do know that people can't be all expected to wear masks, because the 30% of people being vocal about how easy it is to wear one, are not the same as the 70% of people having issues with it, whether it's thanks to health issues, restricted airways, Painful infection on the skin or a general feeling that they should not be forced to do anything that they do not want to do, masks may feel one way for you, A dozen different way for someone else, the air is restricted because it has to pass trough something, it's simple logic. Logic that we are being corded to ignore or reject, once again masks do not restrict the airflow and 2+2=5. Both of those statements are equally correct</p>

        <p>The point  is that even if you think it's harder to breath, you're not actually getting less oxygen. And it's not a study, it's a fact. Oxygen atoms are literally a thousand times smaller than a virus. They don't need as much space.</p>

        <p>I can’t find any source that they supply “extra oxygen” in operating rooms. You don’t really want more oxygen because that means shit can burn faster. But even is that was the case, that still doesn’t mean masks reduce oxygen intake. That’s a conclusion that you took, but it’s definitely a lesser argument then a study literally looking at people wearing masks and measuring them. If those studies conclude that wearing a mask doesn’t reduce oxygen intake, who cares what they do in hospitals?</p>

        <p>That is factually retarded, I know it is said U get the same oxygen levels, But have U ever tried breathing trough a shirt? Try this, try sucking in air above a piece of popcorn, it will go in your mouth, that wouldn't happen with a mask on, Any covering over your mouth will hinder airflow, either the mask has holes so big that it lest trough air, making it fucking useless at stopping a pandemic as the already have proven to be in this panic-demic. It simply makes breathing harder and U get less air. No matter what people tell you about oxygen levels, its a fucking hindrance and even if it was like breathing with nothing in front of your face, I STILL WANT TO DECIDE IF I THINK ITS A GOOD IDEA OR NOT FOR MYSELF</p>

        <p>I have worn a mask for more than 12 hours a day and do believe that it is at most a mild inconvenience for the vast majority of people. I'm also enormously sympathetic to those that have genuine reasons for not wearing a mask and don't think any recommendation from experts or government should not include these exemptions.</p>
<p>What I do object to is people railroading these genuine exemptions with conspiracy theories about a new world order or that a mask mandate somehow infringes on their freedoms. Masks are an effective tool (1) as part of a broader initiative to combat the pandemic that includes social distancing, increased hygiene, contact tracing and lockdown if required. These people are actually doing the genuine suffers a huge disservice with their selfish actions.</p>
<p>To highlight masks as a central tenet of your rights being restricted is laughable. It's no more a restriction than speeding in your car is and applies for very similar reasons - part of the social contract is that we do not and have never lived in a state of total freedom but live in a state that maximises the rights and freedoms of everyone. Part of those rights is the right to live in good health and not have the actions of others infringe on that. This is always a balancing act of regulation - take smoking in building as an example of this where your actions are limited due to their impact on others.</p>
<p>I'm sure I will be downvoted for this post. This forum does not tolerate challenge well and prefers to dismiss dissent out of hand - ironic for a forum supposedly about fighting against authoritarianism but should anyone wish to have a constructive dialogue I'm happy to engage.</p>

        <p>I would assume that you would have something that represents your exemption without revealing any of your sensitive information. It's something that the country of Slovakia has recently done but with testing rather than masks and is a great way to avoid lockdowns.</p>
<p>If your concern is around the ability to be exempted for genuine reasons, this seems pragmatic. If your reasons are the coming of the one world order or 5G chips in masks then I have no answer to a position that was not achieved by rational thought.</p>

Or do you think little insidious steps along the way, such as forcing people to wear badges announcing that they are different, normalized people to the dehumanization of the “other” allowing for the totalitarian regime to take over with support from the citizenry?</p>

        <p>You are delusional. There is no blood liable against the maskless as religious dogma or the cause of the nation's failure or the owning the proportion of wealth or for being impure or lesser. No one is being dehumanised. The comparison of any change in reaction to a global pandemic as the first step towards authoritarianism is mindless and to make the comparison to the killing of 6 million jews is insane and offensive. </p>
<p>Victoria in Australia has had a mask mandate since Oct 11th when their second wave took hold. The mandate had exemptions (1) and along with other tools it has worked to to the point that the state has now had 12 days of no community infections. This is in sharp comparison to how the US has dealt with it's COVID pandemic and its continued record breaking infections and spiking mortality rate, up ~20% in the last 2 weeks. You tell me what happens next, does Australia slide into authoritarianism or will be see the mask mandate rescinded in the same way that the lockdowns have been rescinded? Just acknowledge that it is just a response to an extraordinary situation.</p>
<p>Again, your position is not rational. You have no evidence to back up your assertions and you are making claims in the face of evidence. Your fear of what I can only guess is "big government" had made you take a delusional position and one that is hurting others in society.</p>

        <p>More people have been victims of assault, rape and domestic abuse than people realize. Most people who have never lived it have NO CLUE how traumatic it can be and how long lasting and impactful that trauma can be. Not everyone can wear a mask because of that association. If you were gagged with fabric over your face and forcibly raped, just the feeling of having fabric over your face again in the future can be flash-back inducing. It can cause a full blown panic attack and total meltdown in someone who was seriously affected by the experience. This is why the DSM-5 includes ptsd as a diagnosable condition and why ptsd and other mental conditions are protected under the mask mandates. But no one honors the exemptions, the pretend like the exemptions are just make-believe and they treat people who don’t wear masks for totally legitimate reasons like they’re the devil.</p>

        <p>Yeah, that's why the vast majority of people don't even experience symptoms when infected, let alone get severely sick.</p>
<p>Our immune systems are so bad we need a test to know we're infected.</p>

        <p>False. If you don't have Covid you can't spread it. This idea you are killing people by not wearing a mask is a flat out lie. Come back to reality SJW.</p>

        <p>No, no... I'm implying that out of 1000, about 0.1 have been raped. Or something, don't know the actual number. So maybe you get a special exemption if you were raped against your will but the mandate stays.</p>

        <p>You are completely ignorant and you admit it. The truth is one in every SIX American women has been the victim of an attempted or completed rape in her life time. And there’s nothing “special” about it. Why are you so adamant about a mask mandate to protect such a very small percent of the population who is actually at risk of fatal coronavirus, and yet you’re completely ignorant of the much larger percent of people who live with a trauma that people like you totally minimize? The mandates are the very places that list the exemptions! It’s these people who say “it’s a minor inconvenience” who act like the mandates’ exemptions don’t exist.  Because <em>you</em> don’t need the exemptions you assume only very rare “special” people must and you make up these totally bogus and invalidating statistics. You should be ashamed of yourself.</p>

        <p>Yes, so if you see that 1/1000 people not wearing a mask, are you going to ask them if they're the rape victim? Or are you just going to leave them alone and remember that maybe there's more to the story and it's best if everyone just minds their own business?</p>
