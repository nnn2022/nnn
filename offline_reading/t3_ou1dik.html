    <strong>Natural infection vs vaccination: Which gives more protection?</strong>
    <p><p>https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/309762</p>
<p>More than 7,700 new cases of the virus have been detected during the most recent wave starting in May, but just 72 of the confirmed cases were reported in people who were known to have been infected previously â€“ that is, less than 1% of the new cases.</p></p>

        <p>In r/Ontario I have fucking leftists arguing with me that it's the exact opposite. I pointed out these studies and it literally means nothing to them. They threw a bunch of nonsense from the CDC at me. How can you even fucking trust the CDC at this point.</p>

        <p>Not reading the article but using my Common Sense@tm.</p>
<p>It all depends mostly on the viral load exposed and the body immunes system.</p>
<p>For a person with a normal immune system, it would require sometime to figure out an antibody for the virus, with a low viral load, the host may experience mild to no symptoms at all. For people with weak immune system, they might not be able to produce antibodies in time to suppress the virus from multiplying, this they are at higher risk of serious infection.</p>
<p>Compared to a normal person being vaccinated, it takes 1-3 weeks to develop the antibodies, mrna vaccine will have sooner effects as the body receives instructions to make the antivirus, compared to the older technology of using inactivated virus as a vector, which would take the path of normal virus infection about 2-3 weeks to produce the antibodies, the efficiencies of the older virus tech also relies more on the hosts immune system, this is why inactivated virus based vaccine generally has smaller side effects, because many people have weak immune system, thus they produce less antibodies and since the virus are inactivated they cannot cause much side effects. The mrna vaccine would be more efficient for everyone as the body receives instruction to produce the antibodies.</p>
<p>This means a person who took the mrna vaccine would have antibodies ready sooner, as before that people whom are vaccinated are equally at risk as the nonvaccinated group. Once the antibodies are in the system, it is ready to fight off any corona virus invasion, while making more antibodies existing antibodies either suppress the virus or reduce their ability to multiply, thus we often hear vaccinated people tested positive but with mild to no symptoms.</p>
<p>See the antibodies as tanks, you have the tanks ready for an invasion, vs the unvaccinated where you have the materials but takes time to develop the blueprints and manufacture the tanks to counter an invasion. The more the enemies invade the higher the chance of survival for those that have been vaccinated. This is why we see real healthy unvaccinated people die of covid19, they got exposed to viral loads that overwhelmed a healthy immune system.</p>
<p>But covid denials will never agree with this.</p>
