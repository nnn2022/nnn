    <strong>A new form of tyranny?</strong>
    <p><p>Tyranny is tyranny is tyranny. But, this seems new. There is no “tyrant” as in “leader”. There are many groups, names, and faces we can put to who is calling the shots here. Which makes it very difficult to find out where the actual problem is and where to fight the tyranny from. It’s coming from many angles and in some cases, our own family members and friends have <em>become</em> tyrannical in a response to the increasing tyrannical behaviors all around them. </p>
<p>There are a few names and faces we have attempted to identify as the cause of all of this (thinking of gatttes and sssorosss) but we know it’s more than just them even though their fingerprints are all over the blueprints. And with typical tyranny, the followers have a devotion to their leader. There isn’t really a following for anyone as far as I can see. People aren’t doing things just because Biden said so, Harris said so, any senator said so, my parents said so. Fauci is the only one that comes close to having a following but it is small and oftentimes sarcastic. Also he is not praised the same way a tyrant would be, but he is listened to and used more as a “see? I’m right” symbol. Typically with a tyrant, these things would be done <em>for</em> the tyrant either out of fear or a great desire to please him (usually both in a confusing momentary panic). </p>
<p>I wasn’t planning on writing this with a conclusion, but as I type I can’t help but think that the tyrants are ourselves and the person we’ve pledged allegiance to please at all costs is ourselves. (Speaking as a general society. Obviously most of us here are not exactly seeing eye to eye with the way things are going). We have become an incredibly selfish society that I believe lacks true empathy. There is a high value placed on protecting physical health only while ignoring the social, emotional, and mental costs of doing so. </p>
<p>Maybe that’s what this divide is. The more I think about it, the more I realize that “that side” is focused on the one issue of physical health. And “this side” is focused on balancing physical, social, emotional, mental, and sometimes spiritual health. The other side seems to think that because we can see and touch physical health that they are correct and smarter than us because they can say LOOK AT THIS RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF YOU and we can’t, so therefore they are correct in their minds. And they can feel justified that they aren’t acting emotionally. But just because we are talking about the health of our emotions doesn’t mean we aren’t still discussing data, quality of life, or well-being. It also doesn’t mean we are disinterested or denying the facts of physical health and risk. But we have balanced all of that. </p>
<p>Anyways, I got off topic. Mainly I was thinking through where is the tyranny coming from? I’m not sure it can be classified as tyranny without a tyrant. Can each one of us be the tyrant? Can collective society be the tyrant?</p></p>

        <p>Your post is being downvoted (which is funny because I would think the majority of the "good Christians" in this sub would agree with this), but you're right. I think a huge part of the reason this is happening is because humanity's lacking true empathy. I think humanity has already been losing empathy over time, but it's now accelerated over the last few years. I see much more selfishness, arrogance, malice, and hatred in recent times than ever before. I think this applies to many on our side too, those who are wishing harm upon those they disagree with as well. </p>
<p>People are becoming more radicalized, less patient, and also less forgiving. Online, and also offline, people are much less willing to forgive and forget, and dump friendships and relationships over petty offenses. There's a lot of over sensitivity, and an unwillingness to compromise. Basically, humans are becoming disconnected, hateful, and so on. If the endtimes really are near as some believe in this sub, I can understand why since humans seem to be giving up on their potential to be better, and want to succumb to their vices.</p>

        <p>I think it may be getting downvotes due to my claims that gggattttes and ssssoroos aren’t completely to blame. But it could be a lot of reasons it’s getting downvoted, idk.</p>

        <p>I really don't get why this sub has so much faith in humanity. The citizenry is a huge part of why we're in this mess. Gates and Soros and Biden and Fauci and the other elites lit the fire, the media stoked the flames to get bigger, the people then took that fire and burned everything down.</p>

        <p>I tried wrapping my head around it to get a full understand for when I try to snap people out of their slumber. The only way I've gotten the point across is to approach the issues as a philosophy. The philosophy is that of absolute control by about 10% over 85% of the people with about 5% having an idea of what's going on. </p>
<p>All the issues being pressed through all media has a malicious intent to keep everyone fighting and working within their bubble. All by design.</p>
<p>So yes, I agree, we have ourselves to blame for it. If we took the time to discredit, instead of supporting, the truth would jump right out, but the ego will not allow most to admit to being had.</p>

        <p>it’s interesting how it really is a philosophy but we’re all kind of arguing around the points rather than just arguing the actual matter at hand. For example with masks: do they work or not? I hear it phrased all the time as “do you believe in masks?” as though they have a power that must be believed in for them to work. The actual matter at hand is that we don’t know if they work for physical health but we know they have detrimental effects on emotional, social, and mental health. To me, those effects are not worth it. Especially when the data on physical health benefits is so unclear still. But to the other side, they are placing a greater value on the <em>maybe it helps physical health and all other costs be damned</em> aspect of things.</p>
