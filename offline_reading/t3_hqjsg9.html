        <p>I wish this were true, but I am doubting it. The idiot mayor in my city says that "we opened too soon, and we have no choice but to shutdown again"...and everyone is cheering him on and saying stupid shit like "we should have never reopened in the first place". There have been 180 covid (most of them over the age of 80) deaths in a <em>five month period</em> in a county of  <em>two million</em> people...I don't even know what to say or do anymore. How did these people make it past preschool? How is this not comprehensible to them? How does it make any sort of sense? How do they still believe this virus is some sort of existential threat and these unprecedented lockdowns and other dystopian measures are necessary? The most obvious truths and common sense are now completely unfathomable to the majority of people. They have readily accepted the most bizarre and insane reaction in modern history as good and necessary. I feel like I'm the last sane person on this planet sometimes and that's why I'm glad for this sub. I wake up every day trying to make sense of how any of this shit is even real. When will this end? I am really worried it never will.</p>

        <p>Nothing is forcing us to stay in the country. There are other countries that are freer than us like Switzerland for example who still to this point is the only first-world country that didn't lockdown and is doing well. But I went to a party last night in NJ of all places and no one even brought up covid (except for me ironically lmao) And went to another one a few weeks ago and the same thing except a neighbor felt the need to call the police because of our gathering. The police came up said happy birthday said someone was bitching and they had to come then left.</p>

        <p>üôÑ This again.</p>
<p>Many of us do outside, and "meet people". People are just as crazy as doomer on Reddit. Nosy "Karen"-types, panicked people pulling along their equally panicked kids, people jumping out of the way in public, etc.</p>
<p>I went out today to the local mall. I nodded at some kids and their mom in front of me as a greeting, and the mom looked terrified, and hurried off once it was my turn to approach the counter. I continue to encounter stuff like this everywhere...</p>

        <p>Avoid those people. People on Reddit still need to go outside occasionally and kill grandmas. Been going to "gatherings" since the "pandemic" started with no one even mentioning the virus. Except for a neighbor that reported us but the cop that came just told us someone was overreacting and wished a happy birthday then left.</p>

        <p>Then you're lucky, because this is not how things have happened for me, especially with regards to the cops. In my area, they've mostly been pro-lockdown-ish (they've nagged me, and told me to follow Governor Wolf's orders or "else").</p>

        <p>Newsom just shut down California again and a bunch of morons are literally loving it and begging for more. He is being praised for being such a great leader and "keeping them safe". What can we do anymore? How, in such a short amount of time, have so many people come to accept the most absurd quackery of shutdowns (and all the other dystopian policies) as a rational way to deal with a highly contagious and mild respiratory virus, as normal and necessary? It's disturbing and depressing.</p>

        <p>Food for thought: Flashback - (previously called ‚Äúnovel H1N1‚Äù or ‚Äúswine flu‚Äù) in the spring of 2009. This virus caused the first influenza pandemic (global outbreak of disease caused by a novel influenza virus) in more than 40 years. Why no lock down, social distancing, or face masks?

        <p>This is an excellent article and very thought provoking.  What is the real reason behind all of this?   We know its not science, or wanting to keep people healthy.  So what is the driver?</p>

        <p>Orange man bad.  Orange man must be stopped.  Best way to stop orange man is to burn it all down.</p>
<p>Seriously.  The economy was doing too well.  Trump was (and still is judging by the results of Poland's election) inspiring others who are not leftists to win elections.  This is upsetting the globalist kart.  The only way to stop Trumpians from stopping globalists is to stop Trump himself in November.  Destroy the economy, implement mail in voting (and cheat like crazy there!) and suppress the law abiding population while riling up the people who don't give a shit and you now have a chance of stopping Trump.</p>
<p>It's really that simple.</p>
<p>Watch the timing of the "second wave".  This isn't it.  This is just keeping it going.</p>

        <p>The purpose is to stop the spread of the disease. That's literally it.</p>
<p>Honestly, "you people" who think it's some big conspiracy and are refusing to comply with ANY of the steps are WHY this is getting worse and worse. You're literally creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>America:</strong></p>
<p>Gov: Can you guys please just wear a mask for a little bit? You can take them off once we've got this under control.</p>
<p>You: Hell no! You can't tell me what to do!</p>
<p>Gov: Well... since you guys aren't wearing masks, it's getting worse, so now we have to start passing authoritarian laws in order to make you wear masks.</p>
<p>You: Hell no! You can't make us!</p>
<p>They: Well... since you guys are STILL not wearing masks and it's STILL getting worse, we have to pass even stricter laws and start imposing fines.</p>
<p>You: Look at all these strict laws, they're using this as a way to take our freedom, we have to resist even harder</p>
<p>Gov (and rest of world): /facepalm - well, it's still getting worse, so we're going to have to get even stricter. You could end all this by just putting on a mask...</p>
<p>You: DERRRRRRRRR</p>
<p><strong>Other countries (like New Zealand and lots of Europe)</strong></p>
<p>Gov: Can you guys please just wear a mask for a little bit? You can take them off once we've got this under control.</p>
<p>Them: Sure!</p>
<p>Gov: Hey guys, great job, everyone wore masks and the virus is contained, things can now go back to normal (except we can't allow Americans to visit because they won't wear masks for some reason)</p>
<hr>
<p>Like, all most people need to do is just wear a mask and most stores would be able to reopen, none of these laws would be passed, and things would start to go "back to normal". But by refusing to wear masks and causing the virus to spread more is what is causing the more restrictive laws to come.</p>
<p>Haven't any of you guys stop to consider that maybe the real conspiracy is that you've been conned into being against these really simple things in order to further destroy the American economy? Like, what is more realistic? That making you wear a mask and be considerate to other people is some illuminati agenda (what would be the goal?? seriously? isn't mask wearing ANTI-illuminati because they can't use facial recognition to track people in public anymore??)? OR that you've been convinced by Chinese/Russian bots that masks are an "attack on freedom" in hopes that you don't wear a mask and keep the virus spreading to destroy the American economy while those countries get it under control and actually do get "back to normal" - laughing at you the whole time?</p>

        <p>Totally agree with you, although I would add that making masks mamdatory in enclosed areas should be all that is done. If you want to argue that it needs to be on the second you step out of your home,  then I think there is an issue, but so long as the mandate is kept to indoor public areas, I really can't see the issue with masks.</p>
<p>The way I see it, peoples rights to live without fear of catching a virus outweighs my right to choose when to wear a mask. I don't think the virus is that deadly, nor requires the level of reaction it has garnered. However, there is a virus that is quite deadly to the elderly  and if me wearing a mask stops a train of potential infection that could harm someone (or potentially infect someone that could harm someone) that's more than fine  by me</p>

        <p>What kind of fucked up insane logic is this? Your <em>right to live without fear of catching a virus?</em> That isn't a right. <em>My</em> decisions don't control how <em>you</em> feel. It isn't my job to pander to people who are scared about getting sick from a flu. It sure as hell isn't my job to ensure you and everyone else never gets sick. You are insane. Get over it. Getting sick is a part of life.</p>

        <p>You're right, of course. However, I am not willing to needlessly endanger people from a novel virus that cod be deadly towards the elderly or the immunocompromised. Wearing a mask is literally not a detriment to my life besides fogging up my glasses. You may feel differently, and that is fine as well. What I choose to do and what you choose to do can be in complete opposite, and I'm ok with that.</p>
<p>But if there is a virus that is most infectious when in doors, then I don't mind limiting my spread by wearing a mask if it opens everything back up and also allows a person who might otherwise be negatively affected to continue living their life. If you feel that thay is an infringement of your rights to bodily autonomy, I ain't gonna argue. "You do you" is ny favourite saying, because I'd rather have you behaving in a way that is congruent with your values, and I shall do the same.</p>
