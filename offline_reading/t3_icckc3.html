        <p>FUCK OFF! Why don't you just fucking kill me already. And you shut the fucking borders so I can't even escape this country to avoid it. Open the borders, now, so we can get the hell out of here before you force this upon us. My body my choice, Scummo.</p>

        <p>People have roasted me on here for saying this, but I think this is one of the reasons most countries have closed their borders, and also halted immigration, visas, and passports. They don't want people to have any escape from this. I know that sounds cryptic and negative, it's just that the pieces of this puzzle really fit together once you realize this is all a trap, attempting to get the populace to take this vaccine.</p>

        <p>My husbands Hungarian passport expired and he tried to make an appointment to renew it at the embassy, there’s NO available appointments until May 2021... they pretty much said you’re out of luck right now, should’ve renewed it sooner. His US citizenship interview was cancelled due to Covid in April and still not rescheduled and has an estimated reschedule date of March 2021 because the US is pretty much furloughing the entire immigration staff. </p>
<p>Most people aren’t experiencing immigration issues right now, but if you were you’d really wonder what going on. My husband said he’s ultimately trapped here in the US, he couldn’t leave at all right now to go anywhere even if he tried. He totally believes it’s to make more people take the vaccine. You want to go home? First, you get vaccinated.</p>

        <p>Governments are always hostile to mobility for the masses, as it makes them harder to control. The only reason travel, especially internationally, is even allowed at all is because governments sort of have to allow it, both to stay economically and thus strategically competitive with other countries as well as to avoid a violent revolution against them if people become too mad at them about the travel restrictions and the impoverishment that always results from them.</p>
<p>Notice that as soon as they could get away with it travel became much more restricted both after 9/11 and after this; it's the same pattern. Applying pressure against governments to the extent they feel their legitimacy and existence threatened if they don't submit to respecting freedom of travel is the only real way to avoid this sort of thing happening to us.</p>

        <p>I won't lie. This shit scares me, and I am hoping to any and all Gods in existance that I am fucking wrong about this. Because if I am right, life is going to be hell. A massive lose-lose, because if you do take the vaccine, I think most/all people will end up fucked up from it in some way or another (many theories on the purpose of the vaccine, but I believe them all to be nefarious), and if you don't take it, you will become a pariah, you will be barred from things (I can guarantee you, you will need the ID/passport/whatever to do things including shop, work, go to school, drive, whatever), and it'll be the mask debate but likely worse.</p>

        <p>There are supposed to be international treaties (which Australia has signed) and laws guaranteeing a citizen's right to leave his own country, so I'm pretty sure these mass false imprisonment policies (let's be honest, that's what they are) aren't even legal. Unfortunately we live in a post-legal environment; governments are throwing even their own constitutions onto the ash heap of history, so what chance does international law have?</p>
<p>It is abundantly obvious at this point that depending on the good word, moral compasses, and consciences of governments to police themselves is not enough, even in the so-called liberal democracies. Far stronger enforcement mechanisms are desperately needed to prevent this kind of lawlessness on the part of states, which was a key driver of the atrocities of the 20th century that has never been properly addressed. Today we are living with the consequences of that failure.</p>

        <p>Is it possible that this news article is just to give people a false impression that all this will have some end date? Like, people in Australia are getting restless over continued restrictions (in particular, the police brutality in Victoria) so the government just lies that the vaccine will be here soon. But really they will keep the masks and hand sanitiser and glass screens and all that way longer.</p>

        <p>Eh... From the beginning, the vaccine has been shoved in our faces as the solution. They even told us it would be here in 12-18 months back in March. Creepy how they gave us an exact date on a vaccine, eh? You know, since vaccines take years to create, test, and distribute. I think the vaccine <strong>is</strong> the endgame.</p>

        <p>I always take my medications, I eat exactly what my doctor tells me, I do my daily exercise. This time last year, if a doctor had told me I must do a handstand for an hour before bed in order to be healthy, then by god I would have done it. I always thought the people complaining about "big pharma conspiracies" etc were just nutters. Now it's like I've turned into a crazy anti-vaxxer overnight.

        <p>Just to reassure you: I work in pharma (so difficult to think I'm "anti-science" or "big pharma conspiracist") and I do think that a mandatory vaccine for a disease that's so mild for most people without data on long term safety and with so much pressure (social, political ...) to go fast on the approval process is just insane.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_swine_flu_outbreak">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_swine_flu_outbreak</a></p>

        <p>It goes down to what governements will decide, as pharma companies will probably negociate to be exempt from liabilities (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-astrazeneca-results-vaccine-liability/astrazeneca-to-be-exempt-from-coronavirus-vaccine-liability-claims-in-most-countries-idUSKCN24V2EN) - as they should, a phase 3 trial cannot guarantee the absence of long term effects or very rare adverse events.</p>

        <p>The problem is that they seem to be skipping testing phases, and are going to release this thing into the market already. Isn't the reason that it takes years for vaccines to be released and distributed partly because they need the time to test this stuff for long term effects?</p>

        <p>I don't think that tests phased are skipped (at least in western countries, not in China or Russia) but simply that they are rushed and that the phase 3 (during which you test on a large number of patients) will have a very limited follow-up in time. Not an expert on the matter of clinical trials for vaccines, but if you check Dengvaxia (vaccine against the dengue that made headlines because of severe adverse effects in some subgroups) for instance, we can see (https://www.who.int/immunization/research/development/dengue_q_and_a/en/) that the phase 3 of the trials included a follow-up of 5 years total. They detected averse events in young patients (age 2 to 5) only at year 3 -the vaccine is no longer prescribed for them. I think it is a good illustration of the need to have data on long term effects; which we won't obvisouly have when the distribution of the vaccine will start. If we end up doing mass vaccinations and that unfortunately long term adverse events show up, this will be a) be a tragedy for those who suffer from them and b) break public trust towards medicine/pharma to an extreme extent</p>

<p>Even in our circle, there's people anticipating the vaccine as the solution to end masks, lockdowns, and the "New Normal". I think most people will either give in or be apathetic enough to not care about getting the vaccine. We're already a minority, and I think those of us who resist the vaccine will get treated like anti-vaxx/anti-maskers but possibly worse.</p>

<p>I think a lot of people are naive if they think a rushed vaccine, allegedly produced in a few month's time will be perfectly safe. Not to mention, the fact they have been touting the vaccine as the "solution" since March back when this thing was apparently brand new, and they would not have known, with certainty, that a vaccine could even be made in less than a year's time. Just too many red flags from the get-go.</p>

        <p>Fauci said it’s unlikely to be mandatory. Obviously he’s a shill can’t trust him but there are a LOT of guns here in America   Yes we were locked down but at the time most people were ok with it.  I was too for the first 3 weeks or so. Up here in NJ/NY. I could acknowledge that, we were bas.  At first no one truly knew   But America not only has a lot of guns but a hell of a lot of anti vaxxers and majority of those people own guns. I just can’t see it flying here. I really can’t   I mean who knows a year ago telling me that we’d be living like this I’d laugh   The only thing that worries me is that these companies have invested a lot for this vaccine so like if no one gets it will it just be money lost?   They’re gonna have to make money so yea do they force it for money... idk   Money talks.  But I don’t think this specifically I’ll fly. I just don’t think it’s a good idea lmao.    It will lead to bloodshed</p>

<p>Oh God. I can't believe people are like, "Fauci says it won't be mandatory, so it won't! :D" Fauci is a liar, and has contradicted himself every step of the way. Can people (especially skeptics) please stop trusting his word, even if it's something they want? It's just idiotic at this point.</p>

Even if this COVID vaccine isn’t mandatory in the US, another one probably will. We opened Pandora’s Box by not fighting government overreach at the beginning.</p>

<p>This is why I, the apparent lunatic, kept telling people we should not lockdown back in March. Because it gave the government way too much power. Everyone back then told me I was a nutcase, and to just shut up and watch Netflix. Some of those people are even hanging out at LDS now. Interesting how things turn out...</p>

        <p>I know. It’s so puzzling why people didn’t see all this as the government overreach it is? If the government is “concerned” about the citizens “safety” it should be a huge red flag. But the again I’ve always been very skeptical of government interference in anything.</p>

Schools enforce it already, "no jab, no play" 
Workplaces enforce it
