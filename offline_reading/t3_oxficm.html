<title>TO FRANCE WITH LOVE! If you weren't aware of this song - It will make your day. The Big oppressing the small will always exist in the world. But small people can unite. I am not promoting any kind of incitement, but we all have more in common than we may think.</title>

        <p>Lyrics:</p>
<p>*Disclaimer</p>
<p>(this song is simply the art of expression of those tired of being oppressed - again I do not condone taking action on any of these lyrics, this song was also featured on the movie sound track of 'Sorry to Bother You' ) </p>
<p>We got the guillotine</p>
<p>We got the guillotine, you better run</p>
<p>We want to thank you for flying with us</p>
<p>We know you coulda stayed home, just cried and cussed</p>
<p>May all your guns go off if it's time to bust</p>
<p>May all they tanks have time to rust</p>
<p>They got the armies turning bullets into gold</p>
<p>They got the hookers turning tricks in the cold</p>
<p>And every time the police kicks in a door</p>
<p>An angel gas break dips in the O</p>
<p>And even if a d-boy flips him a O</p>
<p>It ain't enough to buy shit anymore</p>
<p>Sleep in the doorway, piss on the floor</p>
<p>Look in the sky, wait for missiles to show</p>
<p>It's been a blow cause</p>
<p>They got the TV, we got the truth</p>
<p>They own the judges and we got the proof</p>
<p>We got hella people, they got helicopters</p>
<p>They got the bombs and we got the, we got the</p>
<p>We got the guillotine, you better run</p>
<p>I just spit the dope lines, I don't snort 'em</p>
<p>Tell the boss to call police to escort him</p>
<p>You don't write all them lines, you just quote 'em</p>
<p>Get offline, plug in to this modem</p>
<p>No, you can't out-vote 'em</p>
<p>The rules is still golden</p>
<p>Only jewels we holding is if we guarding our scrotum</p>
<p>If you press your ear to the turf that is stolen</p>
<p>You can hear the sound of limitations exploding</p>
<p>Please sir, may we have another portion?</p>
<p>We're children of the beast that dodged the abortion</p>
<p>Neck placed firm 'tween the floor and the Florsheim</p>
<p>We'll shut your shit down, don't call it extortion</p>
<p>Caution -- we're coming for your head</p>
<p>So call the Feds and get files to shred</p>
<p>Every textbook read said bring you the bread</p>
<p>But guess what we got you instead?</p>
<p>Let's keep it banging like a shotgun</p>
<p>We in a war before we fought one</p>
<p>Now if you're tired of working from day to day</p>
<p>A common enemy, we got one</p>
<p>Now keep it banging like a shotgun</p>
<p>We in a war before we fought one</p>
<p>Now if you're tired of working from day to day</p>
<p>A common enemy, we got one</p>
