    <strong>HIPAA tho?</strong>
    <p><p>Anyone knowledgable on the subject is encouraged to reply.</p>
<p>What of HIPAA in the US? Doesnt that generally prevent any entity (employer, airline etc) from inquiring about my medical history - including vaccinations?</p>
<p>Is there recent legislation which changes this?</p>
<p>It's the same loophole that makes any animal an "emotional support animal". A shop owner can't ask what condition I have. That's protected under federal law in the states.</p></p>

        <p>They can ask all they want, but it's illegal for your doctor, nurse, or anyone working at a medical facility, to answer. Even hospital housekeepers can't talk about someone else's stuff without getting fired or worse.  If you, yourself, want to give up that information to your employer, or anyone else, that's your business. And if you lie about it, there's no way for an employer or any other regular person to legally verify, except maybe the CIA or something.</p>

        <p>HIPAA only applies to covered entities.  </p>
<p>Your employer is likely not a covered entity and can ask you whatever they want.    You can of course refuse to answer or lie.</p>

        <p>I was hospitalized not too long ago. My health insurance is through my wife’s employer. I do not work there. </p>
<p>24 hours after I returned home from the hospital I received a call from her HR department. The person on the other line asked me about my hospitalization and I asked them how they knew that I had been in the hospital. She replied that the health insurance company had informed them. I was shocked to say the least. I ended up speaking with the HR director who oversees a company of about 2000 employees and she said to me the following:</p>
<p><em>”HIPPA doesn’t exist anymore, it’s out the window.”</em></p>
<p>We’ve been on the road to being a lawless banana republic for a while and the plandemic moved us over to the fast lane.</p>
<p>No, there has not been legislation changing the law. Our government is simply choosing which laws to follow and/or enforce based on their mood. As usual.</p>

        <p>What do they mean HIPAA doesn't exist anymore? It's still the law along with HITECH regarding PHI and  disclosure. You don't have to answer anything regarding your medical history and the hospital is a covered entity and can't disclose your medical history.</p>

        <p>I don’t know man. It was her flippant response and I really didn’t push it because it was clear they didn’t know why I was hospitalized, only that I was hospitalized.</p>
<p>As for it being the law, I’m gonna say some real negative stuff here but truth is truth. The people working in the marijuana dispensaries that I frequent commit enough federal crimes in one eight hour shift to get them incarcerated for life. There’s over 2 million illegal aliens in Los Angeles living and voting in elections. The Supreme Court of Michigan ruled that their governor violated the Constitution with her lock down orders but she still did it. In Chicago New York City and DC you couldn’t own a gun in your home for over 40 years despite the Second Amendment. See where I’m going with all this?</p>
<p>We aren’t a nation of laws. We are a nation of haves and have nots and you get the best justice you can afford. Laws only apply when they’re convenient to the person applying them.</p>

        <p>Well it is hard to dispute that you are correct if you have enough money you can afford the best lawyer to get away with almost anything really. The law and the politics of the party in power do sadly go hand in hand for some things.</p>

        <p>HIPAA is about data security - who can have access to your data, how it is stored, how it is handled.</p>
<p>The Americans with Disabilities Act deals with medical privacy, but I'm not a lawyer, so I can't tell you the specifics there.</p>
