    <strong>Here is why the Covid-19 vaccines are unlikely to make a difference in managing the epidemic</strong>
    <p><p>It appears that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhaseltine/2020/09/23/covid-19-vaccine-protocols-reveal-that-trials-are-designed-to-succeed/#5d4577b05247">the protocols to test the future Covid-19 vaccines are flawed</a> in the sense that they have a very low bar that guarantees the trial to be successful. The critical endpoint isn't looking at whether the vaccine will prevent death or hospitalizations. Instead, it is looking at whether the vaccine will prevent moderate symptoms. </p>
<p>Also, the number of enrolled patients is so low that the trials won't assess the risk/benefit ratio of receiving the vaccine VS getting infected. This should be an important goal of these trials considering that a large portion of the population is at low-risk of dying from being infected with SARS-CoV-2.  However, in order to establish this ratio, hundred of thousands of participants would need to be enrolled which would take years to conduct. </p>
<p>Finally, it is now known that at least one of these trials (the AstraZeneca vaccine) isn't really using a placebo in the placebo arm but is <a href="https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/1318993925428944897">using the meningitis vaccine instead</a>. <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-brazil-vaccine-idUSKBN2762MO">One participant died in this arm</a> (it is a trial in which patients are being infected with SARS-CoV-2 after receiving the vaccine) which increases concerns that a mechanism of <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/10112/">viral interference between SARS-CoV-2 and vaccines could be a deadly combination</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://odysee.com/@MKWhiteRabbit:3/Professeur-Luc-Montagnier-vaccin-et-origine-de-la-pandÃ©mie-+-annonce:8?t=631">These suspicions were previously raised by several prominent scientists including Luc Montagnier</a> (Nobel Prize for his discovery of HIV) as the Bergamo region in Nothern Italy encountered a much higher mortality rate than other regions in Italy during the Covid-19 epidemic whereas the elderly in this region were targeted with a vaccination campaign against meningitis back in February 2020 (this vaccination campaign wasn't conducted in previous years).</p></p>
