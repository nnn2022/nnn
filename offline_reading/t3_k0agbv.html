    <strong>A realization I made today</strong>
    <p><p>There is a lot of outrage because Sia cast a neurotypical actor to play an autistic character in her movie, Music. I have been seeing it a lot on my Instagram feed because some of my friends are posting about it. As an autistic person, I don't like how neurotypicals are pretending to be autistic for profit. A lot of neurotypicals are outraged by this too.</p>
<p>However, where is their support when autistic people get harassed for not wearing a mask? When autistic people like me express that masks cause us problems like sensory overload and meltdowns, we're told to suck it up. When we say that lockdowns and closures interfere with our need for structure and routine, and that they hinder our ability to access the support and services we need, we are silenced. We're told it's for our safety and for the greater good. We're told we are being selfish for wanting to protect our own wellbeing. Before all this Sia controversy, it seemed to me that nobody cared about autistic people because "wErE iN a PaNdEmIc!!!"</p>
<p>Then it dawned on me. They only care because it's trendy. Just like other social justice movements, it's all for attention on social media and it's all virtue signaling. I find this disgusting. After a few weeks, people will go back to not giving a shit about listening to autistic people and understanding their struggles because it won't get them attention anymore. My friends rarely posted things about autism acceptance on their stories before this, and I'm sure it won't last long. We'll be called selfish for not wanting to wear masks, or stand behind plexiglass barriers that hinder our vision. Doomers say they care about people's well-being, but only if it goes along with the narrative.</p>
<p>So what should we do? We need to keep listening to autistic people and other individuals when they say they can't wear a mask. Stop calling people selfish when they question the rules and restrictions. Caring about autistic people should not be a trend for likes and cute little Instagram graphics. I wish people would actually take the time to really listen to us.</p></p>

        <p>Sadly this is quite common now with a variety of issues. I had friends who for months were all “support rape/sexual violence victims” “support mental health initiatives” “me-too”. Yet when I came clean to a few that I cannot wear a mask due to PTSD from an assault, they told me to suck it up and stay home and that I didn’t have the right to endanger others just because of my unfortunate situation.  They also don’t give a shit about the mental health issues caused by the lockdowns one bit. Needless to say we are no longer friends.</p>

        <p>Lol at calling covid a “plague”. It is a virus deadly to a small portion of the population, but 99.95% of people under 65 survive. And even if you’re 90 (which is 15 years above life expectancy), you still have a 90% chance of survival.</p>
<p>Pretty sure a plague would be something far more deadly than that. </p>
<p>And also, there is little to no evidence that masks actually work. The evidence in favor of masks is quite circumstantial — tests done in a lab and anecdotal evidence is not the same as an RCT study or actual data.</p>
<p>If masks truly worked, places with high mask compliance would universally see lowered transmission rates. But we don’t see that, not even a little bit. So clearly masks have nothing to do with viral transmission?</p>
<p>And I know it’s hard to give a shit about other people, but forcing people who cannot wear masks to wear masks to make you feel better when there is little evidence supporting that it does anything, is selfish and cruel. Congrats on being a bad person.</p>

        <p>Mask DO work by suppressing the amount of viral matter that an infected person expels. It also offers some protection to the wearer. That’s from the CDC, not the tinfoil brigade. Plus, the long term effects of this virus on the heart and lungs are what really worry me. I got parents with heart issues; this thing could knock him out. </p>
<p>I have yet to hear one good argument as to why people shouldn’t wear masks. You say you can’t but it’s really you won’t. It’s about you feeling better versus other peoples’ health. You’re the one being unreasonable. Either suck it up till Spring or avoid shopping offline. The stores will rightfully (and they have that right as it’s THEIR property) kick you out.</p>

        <p>Wow, so mental health is meaningless to you? It’s all in my head? Where have I heard that before...? Oh right, by people who deny that mental health disorders are real. You can’t just make life difficult for people who can’t abide by something — that’s at best unethical and at worst, unimaginably cruel. And you wonder why people are committing suicide at higher rates than ever before. Oh no, it couldn’t be that I have no empathy for people who can’t abide by restrictions that have no scientific basis in reality.</p>
<p>And you want evidence? I’ve got evidence.</p>
<p>On the “long term effects”:</p>
<p>https://sebastianrushworth.com/2020/11/17/what-is-long-covid/</p>
<p>Essentially, covid is no different than any other respiratory virus. Have you ever been afraid of what the flu can do to you long term? What about a cold? </p>
<p>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/09/06/lungs-damaged-coronavirus-can-repair-three-months/</p>
<p>The long-term heart effects has been debunked by cardiologists: </p>
<p>https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2020/11/04/Heart-inflammation-from-COVID-19-less-common-than-thought/4441604499783/</p>
<p>“The findings suggest that myocarditis caused by COVID-19 may be relatively rare, according to Vander Heide and co-author Dr. Marc Halushka.”</p>
<p>Also, myocarditis can be caused by a fucking COLD.</p>
<p>As for face masks and their supposed effectiveness, there is this from the CDC that talks about 10 RCT studies (which means randomized control test studies, which are the gold standard for any scientific analysis): https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article</p>
<p>From the source:
“In pooled analysis, we found no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks”</p>
<p>On surgical masks: “Disposable medical masks (also known as surgical masks) are loose-fitting devices that were designed to be worn by medical personnel to protect accidental contamination of patient wounds, and to protect the wearer against splashes or sprays of bodily fluids (36). There is limited evidence for their effectiveness in preventing influenza virus transmission either when worn by the infected person for source control or when worn by uninfected persons to reduce exposure.”</p>
<p>Masks are literally meant to keep the blood and guts off a medical professionals face.</p>
<p>On tightly fitting masks: “Respirators are tight-fitting masks that can protect the wearer from fine particles (37) and should provide better protection against influenza virus exposures when properly worn because of higher filtration efficiency. However, respirators, such as N95 and P2 masks, work best when they are fit-tested”</p>
<p>The key word there is fit-tested. These masks have to be fitted every year on medical professionals to ensure a proper fit. Otherwise, they are useless. Also they use the word “should”, that doesn’t mean it does, just that it should theoretically.</p>
<p>“In theory, transmission should be reduced the most if both infected members and other contacts wear masks, but compliance in uninfected close contacts could be a problem (12,34). Proper use of face masks is essential because improper use might increase the risk for transmission (39)”</p>
<p>Let’s start with the beginning — “in theory”. This again is a supposition not based in evidence, but based in theoreticals. And studies have not shown reduced transmission, as they stated above. Now, they are assuming that if both parties were to wear a mask, it would theoretically reduce transmission, since that’s not something that’s ever been tried. But they also say that IMPROPER USE MIGHT INCREASE THE RISK OF TRANSMISSION. Proper mask use includes disposing of your mask after touching it, washing your hands before and after touching it, changing your mask after coughing or sneezing into it, etc. it’s not a magic talisman that magically affords you the ability to be around people in public. You can and will still transmit disease and be infected by disease even while wearing a mask.</p>
<p>And then this from another commentator on Reddit, u/clme:</p>
<p>Well, I've been monitoring the evolving research on masks, and the highlights for September-October-November are:</p>
<p>•   ⁠On 20 November 2020, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews published Physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses, (Jefferson et al., 2020). The review noted:</p>
<p>Medical or surgical masks: Seven studies took place in the community, and two studies in healthcare workers. Compared with wearing no mask, wearing a mask may make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like illness (9 studies; 3507 people); and probably makes no difference in how many people have flu confirmed by a laboratory test (6 studies; 3005 people). Unwanted effects were rarely reported, but included discomfort. N95/P2 respirators: Four studies were in healthcare workers, and one small study was in the community. Compared with wearing medical or surgical masks, wearing N95/P2 respirators probably makes little to no difference in how many people have confirmed flu (5 studies; 8407 people); and may make little to no difference in how many people catch a flu-like illness (5 studies; 8407 people) or respiratory illness (3 studies; 7799 people). Unwanted effects were not well reported; discomfort was mentioned.</p>
<p>•   ⁠On 18 November 2020, Annals of Internal Medicine published Effectiveness of Adding a Mask Recommendation to Other Public Health Measures to Prevent SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Danish Mask Wearers. A Randomized Controlled Trial, (Bundgaard et al., 2020). This is the first and only RCT we have on mask effectiveness against COVID-19 in community settings, but its findings of ineffectiveness are fully expected in light of all the other RCTs we have on other respiratory viruses. The results of the study:</p>
<p>A total of 3030 participants were randomly assigned to the recommendation to wear masks, and 2994 were assigned to control; 4862 completed the study. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 42 participants recommended masks (1.8%) and 53 control participants (2.1%). The between-group difference was −0.3 percentage point (95% CI, −1.2 to 0.4 percentage point; P = 0.38) (odds ratio, 0.82 [CI, 0.54 to 1.23]; P = 0.33). Multiple imputation accounting for loss to follow-up yielded similar results. Although the difference observed was not statistically significant, the 95% CIs are compatible with a 46% reduction to a 23% increase in infection.</p>
<p>•   ⁠On 17 November 2020, International Journal of Infectious Diseases published Meta-analysis on facemask use in community settings to prevent respiratory infection transmission shows no effect, (Gómez-Ochoa &amp; Muka, 2020). The authors noted:</p>
<p>there were no significant differences between medical facemasks use only and controls in the odds of developing laboratory-confirmed influenza and influenza-like illness. Similarly, no differences in laboratory-confirmed influenza risk were observed when comparing mask use solely versus combined intervention of face mask and handwashing, indicating that facemask as solely intervention in community is not associated with reducing respiratory infection. Given the studies used medical masks, cloth masks' efficacy is expected to be even lower; a randomized cluster trial showed that respiratory infection is higher among health care personnel using cloth masks than using medical masks (MacIntyre et al., 2015)...Due to these divergent results and the lack of high-quality research in this area, strong recommendations for facemask use in the community context should be issued with caution until new evidence is available to show their effectiveness. This is even more important, considering that several studies showed that mask use is associated with headache incidence and worsening of pre-existing headache (Lim et al., 2006, Rebmann et al., 2013, Szeinuk et al., 2000, Radonovich, 2009, Shenal et al., 2011).</p>
<p>•   ⁠On 27 October 2020, Annals of Internal Medicine published "Update Alert 3: Masks for Prevention of Respiratory Virus Infections, Including SARS-CoV-2, in Health Care and Community Settings" (Chou et al., 2020), to summarize very recent research on masks up until 2 October 2020. The authors noted the serious methodological limitations of the more recent studies and concluded:</p>
<p>The strength of evidence for mask use and risk for SARS-CoV-2 in community settings remained insufficient...Evidence for mask use versus nonuse and comparing masks types in health care settings remained insufficient...There were no new studies on the effectiveness and safety of mask reuse or extended use.</p>
<p>•   ⁠On 25 September 2020, the academic journal Frontiers in Medicine published Effectiveness of Surgical Face Masks in Reducing Acute Respiratory Infections in Non-Healthcare Settings: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis, by (Wang et al., 2020). The review failed to find a statistically significant effect and concluded:</p>
<p>Surgical mask wearing among individuals in non-healthcare settings is not significantly associated with reduction in ARI [acute respiratory infections] incidence in this meta-review.</p>

        <p>Way to minimize people’s disabilities. This is exactly why the ADA exists, and why every single mask mandates in the country includes provisions for people with medical exemptions. Technically speaking, a store that refuses someone without a mask who claims medical exemption, is in violation of not only the mandate, but federal law.</p>
<p>So you didn’t bother reading any of the evidence I presented to you. Clearly, you don’t want to be convinced you are wrong — and so your statement of “I haven’t seen anything to convince me” was merely you saying, “I believe whatever I’m told to believe.”</p>
<p>Facts and evidence don’t mean anything to you. You are told by experts and politicians and media to be afraid of a virus you have a 99.95% survival from, and so you’re afraid. I am so incredibly sad for you, but also, it just proves you aren’t here in good faith.</p>

<p>Again, your issue is mental. Go outside (away from people), stay home or just drive your car and you can have your mask off. Otherwise, wear it and somehow manage not to have a spazz attack like the rest of world. If we can do it, you can do it.</p>

        <p>Actually I think I would probably voluntarily wear a mask on an airplane (assuming I will be sitting close to others). That is one of the relatively few settings where I think it makes sense to wear a mask.</p>
<p>My decision to do so has nothing to do with what the pilot thinks though. (Are pilots now experts on medicine or epidemiology?) My decision is based on my thinking about the setting and deciding if I think it is an appropriate setting in which to wear a mask. I think mask wearing might actually do some good in cramped enclosed airplanes. In most other settings I think they do more harm than good.</p>
