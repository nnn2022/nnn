        <p>It's so sad that some (most?) of our fellow "human beings" are mentally broken or brainwashed. It'll take years to fix their heads, and that's if they want to be fixed. I swear man, there's some dark evil shit happening to our world, and it's been going on for a while. I think things are going to get weirder as the years go on. Like, why do people now have pronouns in their twitter bios? "He/Him", "She/Her"... Jesus...</p>

        <p>Oh good don't even get me started on the gender weirdo shit lol. But yeah I agree. The whole world is going crazy. Alex Jones was more right about things than wrong. The us government admitted that UFOs exist. I also used to be a person who didn't think the election was stolen. But I'm at a point now in life I wouldn't be surprised if it was true. Hell if the media told us fish people exist I wouldn't be surprised anymore neither.</p>

        <p>Search the term "frog men" or "frog people" or "frog crytozoology" here on Reddit, and you'll find some stories about things like:</p>
<p>1) In the 1950's or 1960's some Chinese farmers saw very large frogs appear out of a lake and started towards them. These large frogs were big as a large man, and had huge mouths. They got very scared and ran away as far as they could. </p>
<p>2) Bidpedal frog-like humanoids in some places like in America or other parts of the world. </p>
<p>And I wouldn't be surprised if fishmen (mermen/mermaids) were real. One story that I heard is that the US Navy has observed humanoid-like creatures that can swim at incredible speeds, but seem to vibrate as they move (almost like if you scrolled your mouse across the screen but it left a trail or echo of itself). They were seen at extremely deep depths.</p>

        <p>Are these people real? </p>
<p>I've learned that emotional self-control amongst all forms of outlets is a keyway to help yourself gain composure and confidence. Meanwhile, this person lost his marbles over disagreeing about masks. </p>
<p>Why is it that most people act this narrow and shallow? Why do people not self-reflect on how they act? </p>
<p>Like- "Fuck off! FUCK OFFF!" -what in the world is that? That's abnormal behavior.</p>

        <p>It's relatively common amongst young leftists. They are largely spoiled children from middle-upper class families and were raised either in a Democrat-run city in the US or most of Europe. They have the emotional capacity of a toddler because they have never, ever had to deal with a reality that didn't conform entirely to their whims.</p>
<p>I'm very sad to say that not only are these people real, I've dealt with them in person on several occasions. And they are *always* young and fairly wealthy (if their clothes and ability to make trouble in the middle of a work day are anything to go by).</p>

        <p>There are lots of people like this in California! Through the beginning of 2021, I saw plenty of similar comments on local social media posts. Doomers who still screamed “if people would just wear the damn mask and stay the fuck home” this would all be over. They also continued to say that if we locked down for 4 weeks, this would all be over. (It’s as if they have no memory of March 18th. 2020 when Newsom locked us down through mid May 2020 when everything but the grocery stores, Walmart &amp; fast food was closed). They are all leftists and liberals too. And I would say spoiled too as none of them had lost their jobs. They were all happily working from home while passing on all the risk to delivery drivers from instacart, Uber eats, UPS and FedEx.</p>

<p>You know crazy thing is I used to be more left leaning a few years ago until trump started running for president. It really made me start seeing the hypocrisy of both sides but the last year and a half put the cherry on the top. I wasn't even surprised anymore when the US government admitted that UFOs exist.</p>

        <p>Me too, after Obama’s first term was the opening on my eyes to the bullshit that the Left has gone into. I had been indoctrinated into it young, but around college is when the phase ran its course. The final nails were the culmination of the Democrats stealing the election from Bernie, Bernie taking it laying down, and the Regressive Marxist with Social Justice being the preferred weapon of group wrongthink and policing language that really set it out for me. </p>
<p>I don’t agree with the right on a few things, I respect science, but don’t worship it and our stances on foreign policies differ, but I do respect their belief on individualism and taking responsibility for your actions instead of blaming it on others. Doing stuff like that only delays growth of a person and makes them believe that they shouldn’t be responsible for anything. Just let others dictate for them and they ride in the backseat. I value freedom waaaaaayyyy to much to live that way.</p>

        <p>Same here. I got huge doubt when they did Bernie dirty like that. But yeah the hard right is just pointing fingers and so is the left. I think the damage is done and I don't think America will ever be unified again. Both sides have such strong propaganda going against each other and people sticking to their tvs and social media like flies on shit isn't gonna help. It's sad to see honestly. I used to like America alot more when people were allowed to disagree and you can still go drink beer with and have a good time.</p>

        <p>Politicization man, people live their identity on a bunch of ideas, the thing they miss is ideas are just thoughts or views, you can agree with some ideas, disagree with others, and still be your own person, you can still be adult who sees the grey area in involved.</p>
<p>People nowadays don’t think like that, it’s like talking to the Sith, they only believe in absolutes and their existence is built around those absolutes. Looking at the science cult which hits hard for me, because I enjoy and like science. It’s hard to watch something you like be weaponized the way it is, but i think it goes back to how people define themselves by something.</p>
<p>A man can respect science, he likes it, but he sees the faults in it too, science doesn’t lie, but people or scientist do many, many times for many, many reasons and so because of that science can’t be settled or absolute, not with such flawed people behind it. The science worshipers doesn’t acknowledge that, to him science is always right and they people who use science are smarter and more noble then anyone. They lie, but it’s only because they care, nothing more then that. They don’t or won’t see the darkness in that because if they did they’d see that science can be corrupted, smart people  can be cruel or just dumb and Are fallible which means they are fallible too. The smug arrogance or the certainty of youth in them won’t allow them to see it. It’s really fucked up</p>

        <p>I agree with you 100%. I get that science changes all the time. But this isn't faucis first ride. Look up the video with the guy that invented the PCR test who's name is Kary Mullis who called Fauci out. You probably won't find it on YouTube because I didn't. A duckduckgo search will find it easily though. It's eye opening and Kary Mullis won awards. Unfortunately he died a few years ago.</p>

        <p>I’ve seen snippets of it and I have no doubt he’s right about him, most of the these high profile scientist I’d wager are acting on behalf of someone else interest in Fauci’s case, I’d wager Bill Gates who has all the money, connections, and benefits Fauci could ask for.</p>
<p>The guy is deity for some which I pretty fucking scary, but not surprising. Faucism is now science wrapped up in virtue signaling only instead of vapid people claiming moral superiority, instead its vapid people claiming intellectual superiority because they align with “experts” who are “supposedly” the smartest in their field. Riding the coattails of better men to pretend you’re better too. Bunch of losers</p>

        <p>&rt; Both sides have such strong propaganda going against each other and people sticking to their tvs and social media like flies on shit isn't gonna help.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed reading this thread between you two, couldn't decide where to jump in. </p>
<p>I feel like this has been the problem all along. About 10 years ago, my cell phone broke, and I thought, "Really, if I didn't have one, how bad would it be?" So for a year I just didn't have one. I kept track, and can't remember exactly now, but I counted the number of times it was inconvenient. It was less than 10. More than half were times I saw something funny and couldn't take a pic and send it to my wife.</p>
<p>It helped me realize how addicted I was to constantly being fed information, and since then, I have a phone again, but I don't keep any social media on it. It drives people nuts that I only check Facebook about once a week. And that I only have it because that's where a restaurant I like posts their daily special. About two weeks ago, I had enough, so I told my wife I'm banned from the "news" until at least July 4th.</p>
<p>I can still function in society, I've only had to be brought up to speed on a couple of things (I'm catching up on the legitimacy of UFOs I guess?), so people can unplug, but you can't just say that. It's a legitimate addiction for MOST people I would say. </p>
<p>I realize I'm saying that on a niche subreddit I've been scrolling all day, but at least here I feel like there is some reality, and I tend to not hang out long because I know when I'm getting pissed off. </p>
<p>Anyway, all that to say, once you disconnect from the non-stop shit, at least in my experience, you start to notice other people that have too. You'll be on a bus and you and one other person might have your heads up, not buried in a phone. You'll be the only one in a waiting room just looking around at the world, or maybe somebody else gets it too. And those are the people you won't have to get into it with. They are the ones who can disagree and still finish a beer and a baseball game. We're around, all is not lost. There are at least you, me, and /u/AWokenBeetle!</p>

        <p>Hell yeah man, you’re not going crazy looking around and realizing there is something genuinely wrong with the groupthink, indoctrination, and feedback loops that seem to exist everywhere. You’re sane person in sick world in which vapid narcissism and a lack of accountability or responsibility or critical thinking from “adults” have given the generations to follow a genuine clusterfuck to get out of. </p>
<p>This place is one of the few in which I’m reminded that mature, capable, and inquiring minds can be to discuss the madness that is the scamdemic. The trolls exist, but the fact the come here everyday and get shouted down tells me this place is on to something as far as IDing the sickness of the minds of men everywhere both for the tyrants and the sycophants who adore them. Not all is lost.</p>

        <p>Even sadder, it's probably the opposite. In my experience, it's the product of helicopter parents and the dreaded "participation award" and constant encouragement and affirmation. I know for certain there are people in the world who have never been told "no" or corrected in their actions or even questioned by someone they would consider an authority. I had students who first heard those things from me, and they weren't in pre-K or anything, that was people "ready" to enter high school or even college. They were treated the opposite way, that they can never be wrong, they can never be out of line, they literally do no wrong. So they can't wrap their heads around anything outside of their own shell, and that is why the breakdown like this happens.</p>
