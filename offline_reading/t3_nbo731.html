    <strong>This is America. We Don't Do That Here.</strong>
    <p><p>I wrote this one year ago, May 3, 2020, on a Conservative website. I never dreamed we'd still be at this point a year later. Excerpt:</p>
<p>We are being conditioned to view other people, even friends,  neighbors, and loved ones, as threats. Neighbors are turning on each  other. The Mayor of New York is encouraging people to “report” each  other for not following government guidelines, helpfully providing an  official phone number and demonstrating how to photograph them in the  act. The act of standing less than six feet away from another human  being. The act of showing one’s face in the open air in a public place.</p>
<p>We are being made to believe wearing a mask makes us Good Citizens,  thoughtful people always thinking of the well-being of others. They’re  not mandatory everywhere – yet- but in the cities where they’re  optional, people are being conditioned to view the mask-free as selfish,  ignoble outliers who don’t care about their fellow man. Yet it wasn’t  that long ago that they told us wearing a mask doesn’t help at all. They  even told us it gives a false sense of security. What has changed? Or  maybe the question should be <em>Cui bono?</em></p>
<p>The  masks make us anonymous. They make it impossible to share a smile with  another person. They add to the general air of suspicion, anxiety, and  uncertainty, and they add to an overall impression of dystopia. They  erase our individuality and make each of us into just another part of  The Group. This makes their exhortations about “The Greater Good” fall  right into place.</p>
<p>And they’ve thought of everything. They’ve dealt with the inevitable  American spirit of individual liberty and the hardy souls who will say,  “To heck with the virus. I’ll take my chances,” by telling us that the  mask isn’t just for our own safety, but the safety of others. And just  in case that isn’t strong enough, they add the heartrending bit about  “our elderly loved ones.” So now, if you don’t wear a mask you’re  killing grandma. This is now Social Engineering works.</p>
<p>We’re being made to believe that shutting down the economy including  every place of business and social gathering is necessary “for our  safety.” Why wasn’t this necessary during the Avian Flu pandemic of  1957? Or the Swine Flu or SARS or West Nile or Zika? They’re trying to  paint anyone who sees through the hysteria and takes a stand for  freedom, whether by protesting or even just making a comment in dissent,  as a bunch of nutjobs (and their parents are probably first cousins,  and of course they support Trump because their average IQ is that of a  houseplant). I mean they just aren’t as educated, intelligent, and  discerning as those who believe the entire world economy needs to stay  shut down and the Bill of Rights suspended (it’s for our SAFETY!”).</p>
<p>I’m not saying this flu isn’t more contagious than others have been. I’m not saying we shouldn’t be aware and be careful. But I <em>am</em> saying  that if you’re someone who’s so scared that you gave me a dirty look at  the grocery store for momentarily pulling my mask down so I could  breathe, then you can stay HOME. I sure won’t stop you. But your fear  (not to mention fatuous gullibility) doesn’t allow you to tread on my  Bill of Rights.</p>
<p>It’s impossible not to see parallels to the totalitarian regimes of  history. The devaluing of individual freedoms. The individual being  subsumed by The Group. I applaud those who are seeing all this for what  it is, and protesting and speaking out. It’s way past time we all speak  out and that we stand up and say, “This is America. We don’t do that here.”</p></p>

        <p>For us this obviously rings very true. I never wore a mask. An interesting question would be to understand why so many others (probably the majority) didn’t think this way. Most people did comply even with the most ridiculous, authoritarian government restrictions. Why was there so little resistance?</p>
<p>It was very clear very early on covid had an overall mortality under 1%. The moment I learned this the pandemic was over.</p>
