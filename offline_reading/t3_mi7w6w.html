    <strong>Breaking out of the cage: first confrontation about not wearing a mask</strong>
    <p><p>My husband and i have been saying that the only way out of this is civil disobedience. Yet we always obeyed. Recently we've resolved to not just talk the talk and act on it. We have gone to grocery stores so far without masks - get asked at the door, and explain we have an exemption but will happily distance ourselves from people if they have an issue with it.</p>
<p>Today we went to a registry and we were so nervous, since it's technically a government run business. In the end we were able to get what we needed done without too much confrontation. We were told upon entry thay their policy is to give people with exemptions a face sheild. I declined, but my husband gave in and put a mask on and kept it on his chin. I said they can keep the face sheild for someone who needs it because we are not sick and are not standing too close to anyone else. One lady asked my husband to pull his mask up but he declined, that we were physically distanced from everyone and pose no risk. She helped the people in line behind us instead of helping us, claiming "no mask no service", and that they have the right to decline us service. Ironically, the fellow who she decided to help instead of us was also wearing a mask underneath his nose. She didn't ask HIM to pull up his mask. We decided if absolutely no one would serve us we would just walk out, but a different woman with blue hair was willing to serve us. :) It was stressful plus we had our infant in tow, but successful in the end!</p>
<p>I constantly run scenarios is my head, to plan what I would do in a confrontational situation. Honestly, it was not that bad. And every interaction like this will help us to get better at handling it. Actions speak louder than words. It doesn't hurt to be nice, but it does hurt to give in to the narrative that is being pushed right now. Stand up for what is right, my friends!</p></p>

        <p>I’ve been not wearing my mask since the start of all this bullshit and I can honestly say the stares and people confronting don’t bother me anymore and I’m kinda used to it. I just think to myself I’m not gonna let these soulless sheep dictate how I feel and let them bother me but it does get frustrating.  My advice would be just to live how you normally and fuck what these deranged people think and don’t torture yourself with outcomes you’ll overcome it when it’s there.<br>

        <p>I also haven’t worn a mask for over a year. I can’t say I’m not bothered by the constant harassment, and it’s made me really dread being around people. I’m honestly too scared to go anywhere alone because I guess I look like an easy target and get harassed without fail if no one is accompanying me. </p>
<p>However, I can honestly say that the shame I would feel for putting on a mask outweighs my fear of confrontation.</p>

        <p>Lookout for others that dont wear one and make sure to appreciate seeing them. The more we empower eachother the more we empower others. Especislly for those anxiously watching your interactions in the store. Theyll learn that what were doing is more normal than them.</p>

        <p>How you deal with people confronting you? In my country medical expemtion isn't a term, and it's written on the doors they they will refuse the service if you're not wearing a mask, plus they can call cops on you and put 250€ fine. I don't wear it as much as I can, but the l"mandatory" shit is holding me back as well as threatening people with fines and saying it's a LAW.</p>

        <p>I have been noticing a negative affect on myself, personally.</p>
<p>I go through life assuming that everyone who sees me is going to look at me with disgust, anger, or fear in their eyes, because 99% of the time for the last year that is the reaction I get.</p>
<p>I assume at this point that the vast majority of people hate me and literally want me dead, and that does not do good things to the ol mental health.</p>
<p>I've never been super outgoing, I feel very shy mostly... but at the same time, I used to love having little positive interactions with people. An "introverted extrovert?" Is that oxymoron a real term?</p>
<p>Anyway, I feel like I will never really trust that anyone will for sure not flip-flop on me and start hating me for no goddamn reason one day. That's what happened with every last one of my friends this year, except my housemate. </p>
<p>I feel so betrayed, by people I know as well as society as a whole, that I don't know that <em>I</em> will ever be able to go back to what was normal, for me.</p>

        <p>We have just had mask mandates come back in where I live. I previously half went along with it ie. Would wear them in a store but not outside and definitely not in my car. This time I said enough of the bullshit charade and haven't worn one at all. No one has said a thing to me. It  actually feels quite empowering.</p>
<p>Update - went into a store this afternoon and the shop assistant asked if I was going to put a mask on, I said no I'm good thanks and went about my business. Nothing more was said.</p>

        <p>Be careful. I walked out of a grocery store without a mask and one man threatened my life. Literally told me he would “beat my ass” and “kill me.” These people are in absolute fear, and thus prone to physical violence. If you’re going to peacefully protest, which I recommend and applaud, you should legally carry a weapon for self-preservation / protection.</p>

        <p>I haven't been wearing one. In the UK, there is a broadly accepted sunflower lanyard you can wear that says your exempt. But I still feel like that's complying to some extent; nobody should need to know about my medical exemptions.</p>
<p>I feel people's stares and disgust, but I just smile extra hard at them, (I suspect almost smugly). They hate it. Whenever I see someone else without one in a shop we both smile. It really is important.</p>

        <p>I will put one on but only if an employee asks. Today my wife and I stopped in at a fast food place. We both expected them to say something but pleasantly no one did. A couple of women got behind us in line shortly after and said to us "If you're not going to wear one we won't either".  And took their masks off. I think there's more of us than we think but we need to be the inspiration others need to take that step too.</p>
