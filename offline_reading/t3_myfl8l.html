        <p>I guranteed you the vast majority of us agree that the virus is real, it's just that it's a virus with a 98% survival rate. The governments are hyping it up so that people want their freedoms taken away for their own "safety". The governments are just tightening the noose that has been around our necks for a long time. </p>
<p>See, if they were to do it without some sort of excuse, there would be rebellion. It's like boiling a frog. If you drop a frog in hot water, he's gonna know. But if you put the frog in cold water, then slowly bring it to boiling, the frog won't realize until it's already too late. If you think that our governments actually care about their people, you should read up on some history.</p>

        <p>good analogy but have you heard what happened in India in the past 4 days over 1 MILLION people died. they had to make public cremation areas. so it is not without danger to it. Plus you never really acknowledge it until someone close to you dies.</p>

        <p>Look, if you were meant to die of covid then there is nothing you can do to avoid it. This virus will never go away, just like how the regular flu will never go away or the common cold. Everyone is going to have to be exposed to it at some point. If you die , you die. That is how nature works. All we are doing right now is putting off the inevitable, many more people are going to have to die before anything gets better.</p>

        <p>People will still die from Covid it is inevitable even after the vaccines are issued and the pandemic is over. The end goal of humanity is to completely get rid of the mindset of "eat or be eaten" we want to be the top dogs. we as one race are only second to disease and we have the technology to be the top. This is where the problem starts as when more and more people refuse to evolve we will never be on top. ever. That is the point of natural selection is that things evolve, this includes viruses which is what covid is doing right this moment. My point of small pox was that it was proof of when we come together we can beat the toughest things.</p>

        <p>I personally think that humans "wanting to be on top" is toxic af. This is the reason why we are destroying our planet, and it is the reason why we will kill ourselves in the process. People seem to forget that we are in fact animals, and we have strayed way to far from our true selves. </p>
<p>And you are correct, people will still die even after the vaccines are issued. Just like how people still die from the common flu.</p>

        <p>if you think about it all animals would love to be the apex predator just because we are far more advanced than other species doesn't mean we aren't in a primal state it is all about perspective. take this situation a lion and an antelope from the lion's perspective she wants to find every way to be faster and stronger than the antelope, while the antelope wants to find a way to outrun the lion. Humans built up their arsenal to prepare for situations where something might happen but that is because we have more problems in our everyday life then a lion does. the lion wants a meal, we want a meal, and education, a safe life, a loving family, etc.</p>

        <p>We have created the vast majority of our problems. Lions don't pay rent, lions don't have to buy hunting tags, or worry about some government entity try to take their teeth away. They don't worry about paying for food, they don't worry about taxes, laws, etc. </p>
<p>Our modern society is extremely toxic. </p>

        <p>in the long term, the vaccine will help more people than it hurts, some people may have side effects that could possibly lead to death because they do not have strong enough immune systems, but even though it is really, really, bad either way I rather have 5 people die of the vaccines side effects than 100 people to die from covid.</p>

Also, I'm not trying to be rude but think of it on the other person's shoe. Say one person has covid and one doesn't and again I'm not saying you do this but is that person's life less or more important than putting a mask on for a couple of hours at the most.</p>

<p>''Among people &lt;70 years old, infection fatality rates ranged from 0.00% to 0.57% with median of 0.05% across the different locations (corrected median of 0.04%). ''</p>
<p>The 0.05% means that in all countries that were studied, half of them had an IFR below 0.05% (down to virtually 0) for people under 70, and half of them had an IFR above (up to 0.57%). </p>

        <p>but we as humans can try and make it better but we have to start in the smallest places first. and I know nothing can fully be at peace that is like asking someone to be perfect it is unattainable. things will die, others will take that things place. but we as humans should be better than say a bear and a seal, we have the brains to do better, it starts with the individual</p>

        <p>I think you'll find many old people agree with this also! </p>
<p>Every senior citizen I have chatted with thinks the rules are a load of nonsense. They do not wish for young people to be without opportunity and would rather take their chances with the virus than see the world come to a halt on their account. That generation have been through a lot worse than Covid and are more disgusted that the freedoms they fought for are being stripped away.</p>

        <p>My grandma is stuck in the US and she wants to fly back to Iran her home country  to go to a wedding and see her friends for the first time in a year and a half . </p>
<p>My mum doesn’t want her to leave fearing its “too dangerous” and she’d be better off living in the US with my aunts . </p>
<p>Only thing is she’s depressed , lonely and isolated due to lockdown she wants to be with her friends . My mums scared if she’s let out she will get ill but refuses to acknowledge the mental impact these lockdowns have on my grandma. Depression and loneliness kill the immune system too. It’s just incredible how illogical the covid doomers are . They’d rather the economic system die and all of us commit suicide than us living our lives again.</p>

        <p>well yes the world economy is more important than a donut the best way to improve the economy is by staying safe. We need to not just see the short term but the long term also. think of it like this you can have one brownie after dinner but if you eat all the broccoli you can have TWO brownies. which would you rather have?</p>

        <p>my main efforts were not in the title or text of the post the effort was for the people in the comments. I really wanted to understand and maybe change peoples minds about the somewhat egocentric mindset that is in place nowadays, because the best way to help people is to be kind to them to listen to them and although this pandemic is shitty it will go a lot faster if we all just do what were told, after that BAM! all the freedom you want</p>

        <p>But it won't, I understand you believe that - but your position is exactly what makes the pandemic go on and last longer.</p>
<p>Compliance is exactly the reason we are still in this mess.</p>
<p>People's position here is not ego centric (no matter how others might portray it), most - including myself are kicking up a stink in order to make a stand for the world at large, future generations, and those suffering/dying now of anything other than covid - that the compliant people simply do not care about (due to conditioning).</p>

        <p>for clarity how does compliance make it last longer? and if you don't mind me asking do you think that the government wants to target you?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>if you think about it it is somewhat egocentric because if you refuse to take the vaccine you put you and others around you in danger because a lot of what I hear as an argument is MY freedom MY rights, do not get be wrong everyone deserves freedom and rights but you cant be above everybody else it does not work that way.</p>

        <p>Most of us believe COVID is a virus, but that it’s not any more dangerous than a cold.</p>
<p>First of all, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201126043553/https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2020/11/a-closer-look-at-u-s-deaths-due-to-covid-19">here is an article published in the JHU News-Letter</a>. The assistant director of the Applied Economics masters program (someone who would be extremely familiar with statistics and data) shows in this article that there are no excess deaths in 2020, which is not what you’d expect to see if the COVID death numbers weren’t inflated by “stealing” from other categories. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">CDC itself admits</a> that only 6% of the 1.4% IFR of COVID cases die from COVID alone, and they have changed the way they report deaths so that <a href="https://www.who.int/classifications/classification-of-diseases/emergency-use-icd-codes-for-covid-19-disease-outbreak">anyone who dies with COVID in their system is counted as a COVID death</a>. Aside from COVID, these deaths are reported differently—if someone had, say, tuberculosis, but they died of complications from uncontrolled diabetes, they would be listed as a diabetes death. Now, if you replace “tuberculosis” with “COVID,” it’s suddenly a COVID death. Sound fishy? We think so.</p>
<p>Aside from the inflated death numbers that still lead to an actual IFR of .084%, most of us are not getting the vaccine for the reasons discussed in <a href="https://www.deconstructingconventional.com/post/18-reason-i-won-t-be-getting-a-covid-vaccine">this essay</a>. In addition to this <a href="https://themostbeautifulworld.com/blog/vaccine-studies">here</a> is a list of scientific studies showing that every previous attempt to make a vaccine for <em>any</em> coronavirus has ended disastrously, often with most or all of the lab animals dying, and that previous coronavirus vaccines have been shown to lead to complications such as liver damage, prion disease, and cytokine storms on exposure to variants.</p>
<p>Here is a list of studies showing masks don’t work:</p>
<p><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">A May 2020 meta-study on pandemic influenza published by the US CDC found that face masks had no effect, neither as personal protective equipment nor as a source control</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/">No evidence for the effectiveness of cloth masks against virus infection or transmission</a></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200818072706/https:/www.uea.ac.uk/about/-/new-study-reveals-blueprint-for-getting-out-of-covid-19-lockdown">Mask requirement was of no benefit and could even increase the risk of infection</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data">University of Illinois concluded face masks have no effect in everyday life, neither as self-protection nor to protect third parties</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.asahi.com/sp/ajw/articles/13523664">Japanese researchers found that cloth masks “offer zero protection against coronavirus”</a></p>

        <p>the point of masks is to not protect you but to protect others. it keeps things from going out but things can still get in, this is why we need the vaccine so we have both ways covered. think of what is happening in India when was there a time ever in history that people had to be burned in the streets because the hospitals were all full of people with the cold. You also need to take all the precautions so that they can be the most effective because although we have never met I do not want you to die I want you to be safe.</p>

        <p>I would rather die knowing I've LIVED, than be kept in captivity, being scared of a virus that 99% of people recover from. </p>
<p>Look at the death stats for all cause mortality over the last 5 years. They keep saying hundreds of thousands of people are dying worldwide on a monthly basis due to Covid - but the all cause mortality stats do not reflect this. </p>
<p>My aunt had a brain tumor and died from it - yet she was labeled a Covid death because she tested positive for Covid. Bearing in mind she was on death's door when she tested negative the first time around. She died of her tumor. Not Covid. She didn't even need a ventilator. She could breathe fine. </p>
<p>A similar thing has happened to my friends grandmother. </p>
<p>Now, I'm not saying Covid doesn't exist. I am merely pointing out that they are fudging the numbers to support their narrative. </p>
<p>The other reason I'm disgruntled by this entire sham is that they are trying to make vaccines mandatory. This is truly evil. If I don't want unnecessary chemicals injected into my body on account of me deciding to trust my immune system, I deserve that right. It's my body. I should not be forced or shamed into it. Now, if you wanna get it, that is your choice - and I'm not going to try and convince you otherwise. Your body, your choice. If the vaccine was so good, people wouldn't concern themselves with who ISNT having it. Instead they would do what they feel is right for them and leave everyone else alone. </p>
<p>No vaccine in the world is without potential side effects / complications. And if (god forbid) you were to encounter a side effect that impacted your life, you have zero protection from the developers. They completely absolve themselves of any responsibility and have had that written into legal legislation to protect them from such claims.</p>
<p>Anyone who seems to be pro vaccine blindly trust that the vaccine is safe, even though many who have had the jab have experienced side effects like paralysis and thrombosis. I know you'll say these are rare occasions. But I put to you - if my particular demographic has a 99% recovery rate from Covid. Why on earth would I take a chance with a vaccine that could cause me harm? Logic dictates that in my case, I trust my body and immune system. If I'm wrong, and I get seriously ill with Covid, that is on me. And I'm willing to take that chance. </p>
<p>Nobody has the right to tell me I HAVE to get the vaccine. And it is this exact situation that many of us in this group are not happy with. We are not selfish. We do not want people to die. We just want our basic human rights of my body my choice to be honoured. I don't think that is too much to ask.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry to say life isn't going to go back to normal. </p>
<p>If they bring vaccine passports into the mix this will create a division in society. They are also saying now that you will likely require annual top up jabs to stay vaccinated. </p>
<p>The world has changed forever, but I personally will not play their game. Sacrificing my basic freedoms for the carrot they are dangling. </p>
<p>I have a few questions for you - if you don't mind. </p>
<p>1) Do you think governments and institutions (pharmaceutical companies for example) hold your health and wellbeing in high regard? If so, why do you think this? </p>
<p>2) If you step outside your perspective for a moment can you see any malicious reasons for why they might push mandatory vaccines? </p>
<p>3) Do you believe that people refusing to get vaccinated is the main issue? (I still wear masks in public btw). </p>
<p>4) what harm can a non vaccinated person do to a vaccinated person when both can still carry and transmit the virus?</p>

        <p>1) life will never be the same once something as big as a disease comes into play that changes the entirety of what we as humans have made but it is our job to adapt. </p>
<p>2) thank you for asking nicely and no I do not mind so...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>1)I do think they hold everybody's health in high regard, I know it will not be directed towards me specifically because my overall worth as a human currently is not that high.</p>
<p>2) I'm trying hard to think about this one, because it is difficult to see something from a different perspective, but I can't really think of a reason mainly because why would anybody who has such a high power waste it on an average joe like me. so I would have to say no I do not.</p>
<p>3) I do not think the main issue is people getting vaccinated or not (it is still a problem though) The main issue is the mindset because it does not only apply to this pandemic it could be for example if a guy did not get a vaccine would he say not wear a hard hat on a construction site because even though you have the hat on (similar to taking the vaccine) things can still hurt and kill you. so the whole mindset is dangerous in and of itself.</p>
<p>4) the non-vaccinated person can do less to the vaccinated person but visa versa you could be vaccinated and still carry the virus on objects and now the non-vaccinated person is put in harms way. it is more for the fact that EVERYONE can be as safe as possible.</p>

        <p>The virus is real but as per numerous studies, the death rate is not significant enough to warrant worldwide lockdown (around 0.2%, read source at bottom), stripping of individual liberties, and peer pressuring people into   a global vaccine experiment.</p>
<p>Also, everything that is pushed in the main stream media is NEVER factually correct and it's a huge red flag for me. Masks are not proven to work at all (the science is disputed at best, has been for decades) yet it's enforced by many governments. A recent study showed that around 1 in a 1000 contamination happens outdoor (so 0.001% of contaminations) yet there is nonsense such as outdoor mask mandates punished by fines. They even changed the definition of herd immunity so that it doesn't include natural immunity built by normal contamination. Every detail like this tells me the actions of the governments are not influenced by our health and well being but by their own private agenda.</p>
<p>If they were actually following the science here is what should have happened : quarantine old people and people with a co morbidity. Let society run as usual but spend a lot of money in health infrastructure and personnel instead of giving it to businesses that shouldn't be forced to close in the first place. Vaccinate the people who are at risk IF THEY WANT when vaccine is ready. The end.</p>
