        <p>According to Biden, we'll see dementia patients all over the place in twenty years. I guess even a broken clock is right twice a day. Maybe that's why we see brain fogs and other neurological issues reported after vaccination and maybe people shouldn't fuck up a healthy system that is handling 400.000 different proteins.</p>

        <p>There is no virus in the vaccine.  The spike proteins that the vaccine instructs your cells to make are toxic but they are not infectious. You cannot get covid from a spike protein.</p>
<p>With that being said the antidotal proof that vaccine shedding can cause the unvaccinated to feel yucky for a while is piling up. Spike proteins seem to end up in body fluids as one way they are transmissible, so tears, blood, breast milk, sexual fluids, etc but many people suggest that being in close quarters was enough. It is believed that vaccine shedding takes place for roughly 4 weeks once vaccinated.</p>

        <p>So with contamination from vaxxed people, even the unvaxxed can get the spike protein. I see. So it would be wise to not have any contact with a vaxxed person for a month after the vaccination, right?</p>

        <p>If you are covid recovered then that wouldn't be a problem for you to handle it all. Your body would already be ideally trained to neutralize this by proteins without you even knowing. </p>
<p>If you are not covid recovered and your body has no experience with the spike proteins and are not looking to have your first experience with Spike proteins by using science juice then you could reasonably build up some immunity by catching some of the spike proteins. You might feel yucky for a couple hours but your body will then know what it is looking for and how to defeat it. There won't be any active virus making more Spike proteins so it's not a war you would be fighting but a slight skirmish.</p>
<p>Or alternatively you just stay away from any newly-vaxed person for 4 weeks</p>

        <p>I never got covid symptoms tho i always had contacts with lots of people. Perhaps my body handled it without the need to show symptoms. Im not worried of the protein itself, but of the idea of it causing bad stuff to my body and potentially even prions desease.</p>

        <p>You won't get a prion disease from the spike protein itself. A prion is a misshapen or misfolded protein that infects everything and turns it into a misshapen protein until that creature is dead. Mad cow disease is probably the most recognizable prion disease. The vaccine could potentially cause a prion disease because it is instructing to create a spike protein that is not natural for the human body to create. The chances of fucking that up I think are pretty good.</p>
<p>I see it like this and keep in mind I am an idiot so maybe I'm wrong, I hand you a piece of paper and on this piece of paper are instructions to make an origami crane. You're only knowledge of what you're doing comes from the instructions that I have given you. How many origami cranes do you fuck up? Maybe none, maybe many. Of those many maybe there is one that starts a prion disease.</p>
<p>So the spike protein from vaccine shedding will make you feel yucky it's not going to do any permanent damage because it isn't a high concentration of Spike proteins. I don't believe it is possible to get a prion disease from vaccine shedding. So I believe you are in the clear.</p>
<p>But again I am a dummy so this of course doesn't constitute medical advice.</p>

        <p>Also, can i ask what do you mean by: "but many people suggest that being in close quarters was enough"? Do you mean that after the restrictions people didnt care and rushed into taking the vax shot?</p>

        <p>There have been stories about older moms and dads getting the shot and their kids coming to spend time with them and they noticed that being in the close quarters they felt sick for a day afterwards. </p>
<p>There are also stories about husbands or wives going to get vaccinated and their spouse's would feel sick whenever they were in close proximity to their partners.</p>
<p>So it seems like it's not just body fluids but many people are saying that a close quarters was enough maybe suggesting that they are breathing out Spike proteins, maybe? I don't know if that's possible.</p>
