    <strong>Genuine question, could vaccines weed out the more harmless variants and cause the supposed ‘worse’ variants to become more dominant?</strong>
    <p><p>I know I sound like a doomer but I’m genuinely asking, I’m not a medical professional. With all of the governments hysteria, is it a medical possibility that the vaccine will weed out most of the current variants allowing one of the variants governments are currently losing their shit about (eg, the Brazilian variant) to become the dominant one? This would allow it to mutate further and become more dangerous/quicker spreading in theory (I still believe Covid would remain an incredibly insignificant risk, it’s about how the government use it to manipulate), justifying further lockdowns and vaccines. </p>
<p>I feel like they are already preparing us for this with constant panic about vaccine resistant new variants.</p></p>

        <p>Yes and no.</p>
<p>So the first thing to understand is that this is a virus that is slightly more aggressive than the common cold, but also that the death rates have been massively inflated, and even then only bring the mortality rate to .3%. The "more dangerous" variants will probably hang out at 0.31% or something. The difference in perception is 100% because people are paid to frighten you.</p>
<p>It is highly likely that, just like its cousin the rhinovirus, there will be so many variants that a cure isn't possible and the virus sticks around like literally every other virus on earth and we have a seasonal recurrence of it. This is great for big pharma so long as they can keep scaring people into buying new vaccines every year.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the explanation. So vaccines themselves won’t really play a role in making ‘worse’ variants more dominant. I think you’re right in your third paragraph, soon we’ll be hearing about how X variant has mutated far enough to infect vaccinated individuals meaning it’s going to become the dominant variant so they are going to have to lock us down again. This is why I believe places like the U.K. appear to be letting variants they claim to be deeply concerned about still tick along and spread. I don’t think Covid will ever mutate enough for healthy individuals to need to worry about it, it’s all about how the government play it.</p>

        <p>I'm not a professional, but I dont see how this could happen.  There are a lot of varients that have already been out there, we have immunity to some of them, and the whole viron not just the spike, so that will help protect against new variemts. 
the popular mRNA vaxes only have the spike, and only a very specific spike of a specific varient. </p>
<p>my view is the vaccines arent very effective, so they arent going to have an overall large effect on anything. There might be instances like the claim that the vaccinated are getting infected with a certain varient, but theres no reason that varient would cause anything different to happen. </p>
<p>Coronaviruses and in fact most of these types of respiratory viruses dont dominate; when a stronger one arises they quickly mutate to a less severe form</p>

        <p>No. Every virus ever has variants and this is just the latest chapter of basic virology that the fake news is rolling out. This was the seasonal flu used to cheat trump.</p>

        <p>It's actually far worse than this. Each vaccinated person will become an individualized mutant machine via their toxic tissue shed, both to the vaccinated and the non, thereby creating an innumerable amount of "variants"daily! Stay away from these people until we know more. This is exactly what Dr. Boscch, as preeminent and pro-vax as it gets, was warning about along with Dr. Tenpenny. To turn a phrase on it's head; The Worst is Yet to Come.</p>
