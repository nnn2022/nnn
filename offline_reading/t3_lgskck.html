    <strong>People in the UK are so brainwashed and that's why the restrictions will keep coming.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm French but I live in the UK. I'm getting the hell out as soon as my lease is up because this country is seriously fucked. Two months to go. Going to downsize, fit my life in three suitcases and go digital nomad to travel to low restriction countries, if restrictions go up, I bounce.</p>
<p>I'm gonna leave my friends behind ( I've been here a long time) but why does it matter since I can't see them anyways and people are too brainwashed by the fearmongering rhetoric that they don't go out.</p>
<p>The majority of people here just take endless shit from the government and keep complying. They'd eat poison if the government spewed some propaganda about it.  They will say this lockdown is ruining their lives, making them depressed, stealing their youth away and whatnot, yet they still have that damn mask on and refuse to take back control. The restrictions will just keep coming as long as the majority complies and I don't see people waking up.</p>
<p>It's proper dystopian with corona-snitching going on amongst neighbours and all. Find something better to do. Let people live. Cancel culture having a field day with the hate you get on social media if you post something that shows you not complying to the lockdown.</p>
<p>Don't get me started on the " you're killing grandma"  fearmongering rhetoric. So what we're doing is sacrificing the future and sanity of everybody else instead ? Might sound harsh but between someone 70 who had maybe 5 years left, lived their life already and someone 25 who is getting all their life experiences obliterated by this and will be impacted for the rest of their adult life, I can pick easily.</p>
<p>I've had covid when I was still complying anyways, early in lockdown last year. It was a bad flu.</p>
<p>I'm not going to waste my 20s on this and they can keep their vaccine.</p></p>

        <p>Wish I could go and stay but I don't think I'd be getting any sort of work visa ( I run my own business and I'm not willing to work for a company just for the visa, not that it would be easy to get either ) but I might get an ESTA and stay three months.

        <p>&rt;youre trying to tell me that's all fake</p>
<p>No, you said that. The fact is brexit is more important than the scamdemic and that's the proof and that's the point. That there was a referendum for something less important, way less important in fact, than health.</p>
<p>Funny you said about those "millions" all of a sudden, like you care, the moment 165,000 people die on average every single day around the planet (without a scamdemic) which you seem you don't care. So all of a sudden you became concerned about those who die by following government guidelines? It's mental that you think that way. There is a reason I don't die and I don't get infected. Because I do things differently that those who get infected.</p>

        <p>Do you have any idea how long it takes the Earth to repopulate 2 million dead?</p>
<p>About 10 days. All the 2 million that died of corona in the past year were "balanced out" in 10 days. </p>
<p>Every day the world is overpopulating by 195000 people.</p>
<p>Not to belittle anyone who died, but you think you said a "huge number" but you didn't.</p>

        <p>Yeah but that's not the point, what if you parents / children / friends were killed by the virus and you had to go through that greif, these are needless and very easily preventable deaths, you are all the reason the virus has gotten this bad</p>

        <p>I’m starting to think the same. Does anyone know how strict things are at the UK airports? E.g if I try to go back to my home country (Poland), will I get fined because it’s not ‘essential’? The government website isn’t clear enough.</p>
<p>I’m so tired of the UK. It seems like the majority never question anything daddy government forces down their throat. My colleagues, seemingly intelligent people, are also brainwashed. I once voiced my opinion around them that covid is greatly exaggerated and was met with awkward silence lol.</p>

        <p>From the research I've done, you can go back to your home country since you're a citizen there so I think you could return to Poland. 
Just out of curiosity, how are Polish people with covid ? Because I see a crazy difference between the behavior of French friends I have back home ( most are sick of lockdown and don't give a fuck anymore, they go out and do illegal parties and stuff, go to the protests all of that ) and UK people.</p>

        <p>Glad to hear at least France is starting to wake up a bit! I think restrictions in Poland were never as severe as in other countries (except The Holy Mask which needs to be worn even outside). I’d say most people, including my family and friends back there, are sceptical and think the whole pandemic is an overreaction. My mum’s friend works in a hospital in Kraków and she said doctors and nurses there are not even in favour of the vaccine. Group meet-ups are allowed and travelling isn’t restricted - someone I know recently went to Tanzania on a holiday!</p>

        <p>&rt;Might sound harsh but between someone 70 who had maybe 5 years left,  lived their life already and someone 25 who is getting all their life  experiences obliterated by this and will be impacted for the rest of  their adult life, I can pick easily.</p>
<p>That's not harsh. That's sane and rational.</p>
<p>It's the way all of society used to work and think, up-until the #save-grandma-2020 trend set in.</p>

        <p>I've been wondering where to go, just incase, you know? What are some of the better counties in Europe in terms of the restrictions? It looks more like eastern Europe but I'm not really sure.</p>
