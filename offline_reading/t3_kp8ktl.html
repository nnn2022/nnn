    <strong>Covid feeds the ego of the worst people in society</strong>
    <p><p>Covid has made it not only socially acceptable, but CELEBRATED to a.) brag about yourself and all the noble work you’re doing by masking up and “staying home, saving lives” while b.) simultaneously publicly and openly shaming other people for not being as good and virtuous as you and your perfect family.</p>
<p>In the past, people used to have to resort to humblebragging and other passive aggressive tactics if they wanted to “show off” their lives (and they would frequently get called out for it). It was also not socially acceptable to shame and attack other people. Covid has given people free reign to do both these things. </p>
<p>If the people claiming to care so deeply about the Covid death count and “saving lives” actually cared they would be trying to educate and enlighten those who seemingly “don’t get it” rather than turning the whole thing back into a conversation about themselves and how hard they are working and sacrificing to “save lives.” But instead they attack and insult those they deem less virtuous than themselves — they insult, name call, dox, organize mini lynch. mobs, attempt to get people fired from their jobs, and — with an alarming frequency — outright WISH death and illness on those who don’t live up to their pious standards.</p>
<p>Anyone who really cared about saving lives and preventing people from catching this “horrible virus” would not revel in glee and joy when they find out someone else has it.</p></p>

        <p>Ironically, most of them have the very least to show for it. The people I've known in my life that are wildly successful almost have a hard time bragging. It doesn't come out right, they don't feel comfortable doing it. But the 25 year old with no job that sits at home all day? Selfies galore, motivational quotes, shitting on other people constantly. It's strange. I suppose this is the end result of - everybody gets a trophy culture.</p>

        <p>Preach! I've been saying this from the start. Anyone you see boasting about how they're a "collectivist for the people" and "I care about other people"... It's just bullshit. They don't really care about anyone else, as can be evidenced by their comment history which will 99.99999% have a comment wishing ill will and death upon anyone who opposes lockdown restrictions. </p>
<p>It was never about them caring about others and being "all in this together". It was always about them getting a boost of moral superiority over others as well as a feeling of authority over others since they can shame anyone who doesn't wear a mask. 2 things humans crave... Authority over others and feeling better than anyone else. 2 boxes checked.</p>
<p>I truly wonder how they'll fill that void once this (hopefully) ends.</p>

        <p>Ready for the real mind-blower?</p>
<p>There are something like 42 <em>million</em> abortions worldwide every year. On the pure numbers basis this should be near genocide (especially when you get down to the country level statistics).</p>
<p>Unfortunately most if not all of the covidiot crowd thinks that's a "choice." So it's not comparable. Death is death. Zero consistency in these fuckers' thought processes.</p>

        <p>It's virtue signaling because you've wondered off into the realm of ethics and morality. Calling 42 million abortions 42 million deaths and a "genocide" isnt objective. It requires your own personal morality to be applied to make such a claim.</p>

        <p>&rt; basic pandemic control</p>
<p>Ah yes, the lockdowns that have never been done before in history, the propulsion of people into mass joblessness, poverty and homelessness, the deprivation of education for children, the dismantling of human rights, the largest wealth transfer in the history of the world to the upper classes and elites, the mass starvation of peoples in 3rd world countries, the health problems that arise from sedentary lifestyles, lack of socialization and lack of routine medical care and checkups and what is most likely one of the largest mental health crisises in the world's history. Just "basic pandemic control" things.</p>
<p>But 10 months into all this, let's ignore any legitimate concerns and pretend it's still all about people who want haircuts while they go bowling at applebees.</p>
