    <strong>My colleagues were laughing about people being barred from seeing their grandkids for resisting vaccination</strong>
    <p><p>I live in a blue state in the US with strict lockdown measures and am currently pursuing my doctorate. My university has not allowed me back into my office for well over a year at this point, and since I live off-campus in an apartment, I'm not required to get vaccinated (yet). I'm in my twenties, athletic, and already have beaten COVID. I have no medical reason to get the vaccine.</p>
<p>Today in our weekly research meeting before starting on our agenda, people were discussing vaccination casually. I remained quiet while my colleagues happily announced when their first/second shots were scheduled. Didn't bother me, they're free to get vaccinated if they wish. Somebody mentioned that one of his siblings is refusing to get vaccinated, so his nephew has decided not to allow them to see their grandkids until they get the shot. Another person mentioned that several of her friends are doing the same thing: telling their parents that unless they get the shot, they can't see their grandkids.</p>
<p>The response to this? Smiling awkwardly, chuckling, and commenting, "Well that's one way to incentivize vaccination, hopefully it'll work."</p>
<p><strong><em>This is insane.</em></strong> It's emotionally abusive behavior, and these people found it funny because they've joined the Church of Covid. I respect other people's choice to get vaccinated, but bullshit like this is just incentivizing me to double down and not get the shot.</p>
<p>I had to turn my camera off when the meeting began and wipe some tears away from my eyes. I know that other people have it far worse than me -- at least I didn't know somebody who died of the virus, or lose my business/job to the lockdowns. But this is not tenable. My conscience and my integrity are <strong>screaming</strong> at me to not get the shot, but I'm terrified of the consequences. I'm terrified of being bullied by my supervisor and/or the university into getting it, and losing 2 years of hard work toward my PhD. Walking around maskless has been easy, and I don't mind the shitty remarks or dirty looks from people whose faces I can't see. I've been incredibly confident in making fun of this absurdity and flouting the rules. But for some reason, after this incident I feel incredibly isolated, scared of my views being made known, and scared of the consequences. Thankfully I have a friend to talk to about this -- I'm gonna go see him later.</p>
<p>I'm planning on relocating to Florida or Texas if my university mandates vaccination, as I will have reached candidacy by the time that decision comes and my research can be done remotely so long as I am productive. I guess I just needed to let this out.</p></p>

        <p>Thanks. The past year has been unbelievably hard, and I have no family to go live with or reach out to. I don't usually post rants in search of some validation, but today I just need to hear from a few people here that (1) I'm not insane in refusing to compromise on my integrity and (2) I'm doing my best and it's okay to feel drained or sad occasionally.</p>

        <p>Not insane and yes you are doing your best, and who wouldn’t feel that way in your position.  In fairness to your colleagues, some have them may feel the same as you do but are too scared to show it in a work/school setting.  Some of them may be suffering as you  are.</p>
<p>My advice is to get away as fast as you can.  It will be a disruption to be sure, but a move you will be grateful you made.  Start shopping for universities based on their doomerism versus openness.  Vote with your feet and make the doomer schools wonder where all their students went.  Plus, if you stay do you really think you’ll get your PhD on a reasonable time scale from such a place after what has already happened?  Don’t wait outside a closed store hoping it will open— go to an open store.  Any hesitation on your part will be due to fear of change and fear of admitting you’ve been had and the accompanying grief involved in the loss of what might have been.  Don’t fall prey to the sunk cost fallacy— get out.  You are being abused.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

        <p>Science in academia is essentially just a PhD factory at this point. You get public money, you let some poor dude characterize, say, whale-fart protein #5448, you convince yourselves that this "will have broad application in a number of fields, including medicine, research, and even public health", and you repeat.</p>
<p>It's a massive waste of public funds. As someone going to grad school <em>right now</em> to be a science teacher, FUCK STEM. Fund the humanities. Bring back our morals and a sense of purpose.</p>

        <p>Your feelings are completely valid. The rhetoric they use to push the vaccine is powerful and problematic. “You’re a hero and you save lives by getting the shot” seems innocuous but it creates an inverse of villains and killers of those that oppose. I think we’re all afraid of peoples eagerness to deride those who make the choice not to get the vaccine and what that might lead to down the road. I’m not surprised by the anti-intellectual sentiment coming from universities and the suppression of data, science and healthy debate that Covid has brought to the surface. It’s everywhere. It’s dividing us all. I just hope we can figure out a way to combat this narrative that dehumanizes those that do not follow the crowd. We are being pitted as selfish, ignorant, dangerous and I don’t believe people have enough rational and decency left to see where this line of thinking will end or who it will hurt.</p>

        <p>it has nothing to do with the bullying; it's that they don't think the bully target deserves it</p>
<p>when that changes, you quickly learn how viscously they will bully, shame, and attack</p>

        <p>I've started ridding myself of friends and acquaintances who make fun. I gave them a year because I know it was confusing, but they're still on their covid cult bullshit. </p>
<p>I don't have anyone where I live either. I moved here to raise my kid around his Dad and his Dad's huge family. And I loved it here until 2020. Now I feel trapped. His family is mostly No NN, but his Dad isn't nearly as bothered as I am, so he has no problem with masks and tests in school. It drives me crazy. I'm afraid he'll eventually bend to the vaccine and try to let me vaccinate our kid. It's very scary.</p>

        <p>Brother lmk if you want to chat sometime. My university mandated it. I expect to be fired in the next month or two. It’s a real damn shame, I like the job it has great benefits. I even liked the people up until this year. </p>
<p>My own boss bragged about bullying his parents into getting vaccinated or they would never see their grandkids again.  I am the only one on my team of 8 not vaccinated. I have become a literal pariah. </p>
<p>I could take the shot and just get in line. I had actually considered it up until recently. Then these mother fuckers threatened my ability to feed my kid’s.  Something about being coerced just really rubs me the wrong way. </p>
<p>I have a very promising interview lined up for a nearly 50% raise. Benefits aren’t as good though. I’m sacrificing nearly half a million in free education for my kids. I’ve been torn up about it for a week or two.</p>

        <p>Don’t worry, they will.  Get out now and go where it’s free.  Read the signs.  Don’t be the frog in the pan slowly boiling to death.  As someone who has left many, many bad jobs (and went through all kinds of denial, bargaining, etc until it was unbearable) I can tell you this:  All the suffering is on the front end, before you leave.  After you leave you never look back unless it’s to say “whew that sucked.  Why did I wait so long?”</p>
<p>Do this exercise that I will call the “frog test:”.  Imagine it’s let’s say October of 2019 and you show up and it’s suddenly like today without the intervening time and conditioning.  Visualize it.  You show up and people say your education will be delayed and cheapened and you will be browbeaten into taking an experimental injection.  Would you say, “fuck this!” and walk away, like the frog would say if he had to jump into hot water?  If the answer is yes, you probably should have left already.</p>

<p>It’s really tough. I think once a few started mandating the rest are slowly going to fall jn line. I know they’ve always required them for students, but fac/staff? I never consented to making unelected bureaucrats make my medical decisions when I was hired. </p>
<p>It really sucks but I don’t think I have much of a choice unless I can find a medical exemption. Part of me just wants to tell them to fuck off and quit even if I do get a medical exemption.</p>

        <p>This kind of policies is exactly why I won't get vaccinated. If it's all safe and voluntary, these kind of draconic measures aren't needed. Yet these measures are there, which makes me <strong>dis</strong>trust the people that are pushing me.</p>

        <p>&rt;This is insane. It's emotionally abusive behavior, and these people found it funny because they've joined the Church of Covid. I respect other people's choice to get vaccinated, but bullshit like this is just incentivizing me to double down and not get the shot.</p>
<p>I could have written that exact same paragraph, including the mention of the Church of Covid.</p>
<p>&rt;My conscience and my integrity are screaming at me to not get the shot, but I'm terrified of the consequences. I'm terrified of being bullied by my supervisor and/or the university into getting it, and losing 2 years of hard work toward my PhD.</p>
<p>I would rather give up those two years than yield for the vaccine crowd. Looks like you are doing the same, stay strong!</p>
<p>&rt;But for some reason, after this incident I feel incredibly isolated, scared of my views being made known, and scared of the consequences.</p>
<p>I'm so sorry for you, have a virtual hug, hope you can find some connection with people.</p>

        <p>I've heard of this happening. An older friend of mine I've known for years had this happen to him. He told her he didn't think it was appropriate to use grandkids as a way to coerce him over a personal health choice. The daughter told him it was for "safety," to which he responded that children have no risk of COVID and his daughter and her husband already got the injection. Safety of and to whom? The daughter wouldn't budge so he said, "this breaks my heart, but I won't be treated this way" and cut her off and disinherited her. The daughter amassed an army of other family members through some lies and manipulation and rescinded the previous ultimatum to when "COVID cases/deaths" were better, but the damage has been done.</p>
<p>It's sad so many relationships are being ruined over this; it's patently wrong to attempt to shame and bully people over a health choice like this over a disease like this. The hysteria must end and indulging this nonsense further simply spoils the hysterics.</p>
<p>I'm sorry this is happening OP. I would attempt to get a medical or religious waiver. I will not get the COVID injection at all.</p>

        <p>I'm in a similar position with my work, though I at least have family to talk to. I really only have one friend left who feels the way I do about all of this madness. Most of the others have partially or fully bought into the hysteria. It's rough and sometimes really depressing. I feel for you and just wanted you to know that you definitely are not alone. Others like you are out there. What you described in your Zoom meeting is despicable and shocking, but hang in there. The truth will out.</p>

        <p>As a bisexual, I can tell you that the feeling of being in the closet with your politics is almost identical to being in the closet with your sexual orientation. The way it tears families apart is also eerily similar. I hate hiding my political beliefs and values, and it's shitty to know how many of your friends would gladly see you burn at the stake if they knew the truth, but it's par for the course in a blue state.</p>
<p>I feel right now like I'm in the "vaccination closet," and there's a sense that I'll be exposed very soon if there's a vaccination mandate. This is too far.</p>

        <p>That’s awful. When I see people waiting for guidance to hug people or see their parents/grandparents I just can’t believe people are still doing this. My mom would have killed herself if she couldn’t see her grandkids.</p>
<p>I have a few colleagues that aren’t getting vaccinated (and we teach science, at a college) but everyone else would be appalled. One other coworker basically told me I was mooching off his herd immunity, I wanted to tell him to F off but didn’t think that would go over well. But yeah I’ve decided this is my line and I will find a doctor to give me an exemption or go on leave if it gets mandated and find a new job. Stand strong and hold on to your integrity. I’ve started being less subtle at work because I’ve accommodated everyone’s hysteria for a year. Having the handful of coworkers who would back me up has made it easier. Hopefully you can find someone more rational at grad school, there’s gotta be at least one, it’s just hard to communicate right now.</p>

        <p>I know have you feel. Luckily for me my family and my girlfriend agree with me on the vaccine. I'm just- it pains me to worry about if her school were to force her to get it. We promised we'd never get it. I know she wouldn't get it, for herself and for me. So will my family. They won't get it either. </p>
<p>I'm just worried on how desperate they will push it. I pray to God they won't mandate it this fall for schools K-12. They will have an uproar if they do.</p>
