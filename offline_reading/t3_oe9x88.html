        <p>From the documentation that comes with the vaccine..   </p>
<p><em>The vaccine is not to be used for the treatment or prevention of covid 19.</em></p>
<p>The vaccine is not intended to stop you from getting covid.</p>
<p>The vaccine does not stop you from giving others covid.</p>
<p>The vaccine allegedly reduces the symptoms from covid and "decreases" the need for hospitalization.</p>
<p>Covid 19, if using the governments own numbers (which they themselves have admitted are wrong/high) you have a higher chance of dying from the vaccine.  I'm not even including the permanent side effects like heart attacks, strokes, clots, sterility, blindness, permanent continuous muscle convulsions, myocarditis, various neurological disorders, etc...  and these are just the ones we know about. </p>
<p>Also some have gotten the saline only placebo.  And when I say some, insert "all the elites" here.  They don't want to be dead/sterile, that's what they want for the unwashed masses.  The only politician to have "died from covid" was the president of Tanzania who incidentally is the only politician to call this a hoax from the start.</p>

        <p>Yeah that story got shut down quick.  So did the one where the GA nurse passed out while live on TV taking the vaccine to show how safe it was.... quietly reported many days later that she died.</p>
