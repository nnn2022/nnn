        <p>Some can't have the vaccine due to health problems. Persecuting them is like discriminating against the disabled. Also, this sentence is an absolute abortion of logic:</p>
<p>&rt; While most medical information is supposed to be kept private, Sneddon added that the contagious nature of COVID-19 means the same rules don’t necessarily apply</p>
<p>They apply for <em>AIDS</em>.</p>

        <p>The same governments who want to force an un-needed, improperly tested vaccine on us - likely on pain of legal and societal sanctions, have been doing things like removing the requirements to disclose AIDS infection to potential partners, and decriminalizing infecting someone without their knowledge.</p>
<p>Of course, this is because AIDS primarily infects a "protected" group.</p>
<p>It's a medical version of anarcho-tyranny.</p>

        <p>My personal opinions aside, remember that AIDS is transferred through an exchange in body fluids. COVID is transferred through shared air. The difference is that on a plane, you’re not very likely to be seated by someone with an open wound who will end up dripping into your own open wound. But you will absolutely share air, with everyone onboard, not just your seat neighbours. </p>
<p>Also. Many employers already require proof of your vaccinations before employment, many countries require proof of vaccination before travel, and these have existed long before COVID.</p>

<p>But I thought that infection on airplanes was extremely rare, even now when we are "right in the middle of the pandemic"?</p>

        <p>It should be! They have really good air filtering procedures and are able to enforce fairly strict policies. The problem is that it is hard to ensure social distancing, and masks are removed during snacks/meals. I’m not saying that COVID risks are high on an airplane, just much much higher than AIDs. It’s not a fair comparison.</p>
