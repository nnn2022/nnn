    <strong>What happened to counter culture?</strong>
    <p><p>The last time I really tried to go out and do something was July 4th.</p>
<p>The city had announced they were allowing bars to reopen the day before and all I wanted to do was go out and get absolutely wrecked drunk, which, wouldn't have taken long, since I hadn't been able to go to bars in months.</p>
<p>Walking down the street most of them were still closed some with doors entirely nailed shut.  No telling if they would ever reopen again.  I did however find that a dive bar that I used to be a regular in was open.</p>
<p>Out front were a small group of punks and bums smoking without masks on.  "Fuck yes," I think to myself.  This is a true dive bar.  The only people that drink here are homeless, punk kids, and locals.  You can sit in a place like this all night enjoying $5 beer and shot combos while listening to drug addled needle sharing miscreants in filthy denim and studded belts swap stories about cops kicking them off sidewalks and who stole whose dog between trips to the bathroom to do lines of coke.</p>
<p>A lovely place, and it was open again.</p>
<p>So I walk inside and the bartender turns around.  A woman that had served me for years, whom I have had hours of conversation with and saw on the street nearly every single day as our jobs were so near to one another and greets with excitedly...through a mask.  And then before she is even done saying hello points at me and goes "oh! oh! mask!" and then I look at the small scattering of drinkers around me, another five or six of the above described average patrons all of whom are also wearing masks "where's your mask dude?" "can't be in here" etc.</p>
<p>My heart sank, "really?" I sighed.  "What do you mean really?" the bartender answers as I walk out the door and down to a liquor store which also bears a giant sign reading "no entry without mask".</p>
<p>I just went home sober and angry.  How are these people even towing the line?  How did "I" become the counter culture?  I'm just an average guy that likes cheap beer and trashy bars.</p></p>

        <p>My first instinct is they don't want to lose their jobs. But when you see people out and about wearing masks when they are not anywhere near their livelihood, you can bet that the spirit of counterculture and rebelliousness is pretty much dead.</p>
<p>In other words, the counter culture is us.</p>

        <p>Pretty much.  Even all of my activist friends, some of whom have been fighting the power for decades, have fallen in line and are doing everything that "the power" has been telling them to do.  It's quite disheartening.</p>

        <p>Yep. Sad state of affairs.  </p>
<p>Punks in masks? Just goes to show that there are no real punks anymore. </p>
<p>The media has done a great job trying to paint the average anti-masker as everything anyone in what’s left of anything that could be described as counter culture would never want to be associated with. The social shame of being one of “them” has been made too great.</p>

        <p>“Counter culture” has been taken over by large corporations and those in power.  People who think they are part of the “counter culture” are really serving the system that they claim to be fighting.</p>

<p>The only real punk music being made right now has been lambasted as "incel-core" lmao. School Shooter/Negative XP and MK Ultra Support Group   at least feel like proper counter-culture</p>

        <p>Reminds me of Jack Nicholson's lines in the campfire scene in Easy Rider:</p>
<p>"They’re not scared of you. They’re scared of what you represent to ’em... What you represent to them is freedom... That’s what’s it’s all about, all right. But talkin’ about it and bein’ it, that’s two different things. I mean, it’s real hard to be free when you are bought and sold in the marketplace. Of course, don’t ever tell anybody that they’re not free, ’cause then they’re gonna get real busy killin’ and maimin’ to prove to you that they are. Oh, yeah, they’re gonna talk to you, and talk to you, and talk to you about individual freedom. But they see a free individual, it’s gonna scare ’em... It makes ’em dangerous."</p>

        <p>I was in NYC a few weeks ago and we were stopped at a red light. Crossing the street was a girl with crazy dyed hair, traditional punk/goth clothing, covered in tattoos and piercings wearing an N95 and a pair of those rubber gloves you do the dishes with walking completely alone.</p>
<p>All I could think was this girl put a lot of effort into being the counter culture rebel only to jump on the Covid bandwagon full force. </p>
<p>I would’ve never thought of myself as a rebel in any shape or form before Covid, but I test the boundaries daily of this bs. Went to Pet-smart without a mask the other day, I mean it’s probably a disease ridden store anyway, there was a puddle of piss in one of the aisles. A teenage worker comes up to me and demands I put a mask on or leave and I said no and he said well you have to. I pointed to my coffee and said I’m drinking and he said oh ok and just turned around and walked away. Remember if you’re drinking something you can’t catch Covid.</p>

        <p>Actual eccentrics don’t dress up as punky goths or whatever because they have no need to make a show of being non-conformists. They just authentically are it, and they carry their non-conformism around in their minds. Pink hair and lots of tats and piercings should tip you off that this person is a follower who craves admiration as conventionally cool. No wonder she conforms to the mask and gloves trend.</p>

        <p>That's very true. The sort of people who have to make a big show out of being non-conformists are very often using it as a cover for how conformist they truly are.</p>

        <p>It has been said before that "right is the new left", and while that isn't really true at all it does capture the true fact that ruling class institutions are converting from Christianity and traditional Western values to a new legitimizing ideology: intersectional social justice and the inversion of traditional Western values, laced with a heavy dose of paternalistic, totalitarian, and bureaucratic safety-cultism.</p>
<p>What this means in practice is that, although the process is far from complete, having tattoos and piercings is a sign of submission to mainstream culture rather than rebellion against it. This is why we see "counter-cultural" people saying and doing all the "right" things about COVID-19. If you look at people that dress and behave very traditionally they get the stares and reactions that truly counter-cultural people get.</p>
<p>In the future tradition will decouple from the authoritarian social power structures and appeals to unbroken practice that have hitherto sustained it, and rebellion will reorient its resistant gaze toward a new authoritarian power structure and ideology. The decline of conservatism and its middle class base, and its gradual replacement by populism and a working class base, is an early sign of this process.</p>

        <p>I highly identify as from a sub or counter culture. I’m older now, but still an old punk at heart, I still have my jacket, even if it’s in the back of my closet.  The newest crop of alt culture kids don’t care about subversive behavior anymore.  Its not about “f**k you man!” anymore. It’s all about aesthetic and fashion, not much else.</p>
<p>Almost all of them are pro-lockdown.  I am an outsider in a community of “outsiders.” It sucks.</p>

        <p>Precisely. I believe it's the difference between people who actually are outsiders and people who like the idea of being an outsider but don't want to deal with what it takes to actually be one.</p>
<p>I actually don't think there's anything wrong with that as such; the problem comes when the two are conflated as being one and the same when they're actually quite different.</p>

        <p>Exactly. Even though I am an old crusty punk from the pre-internet era, I don’t bemoan the fashion kids.  Many of them are my close friends, ain’t nothing wrong with it, most people do it for attention now a days, which I understand.  The crap thing is, all my creative/alt communities seem to be the mask/lockdown forever crowd and it seriously pisses me off.  Also every event I was part of or went to is gone now, and I am really lacking in people to talk to.  This whole thing is awful and dystopian as hell.</p>

        <p>Yeah subcultures have been largely subsumed into the machine. Even people who have expressed skepticism about government and corporate overreach in the past are running into the formerly untrustworthy politicians' and pharmaceutical industry's arms. The media has become so powerful and expansive and has polarized people into thinking you either believe the whole mainstream narrative or you are a homicidal kook. However I also think this is partly due to the public perception of medicine/science as a priestly class, which makes it hard for people to even want to think critically about the claims in the media.</p>

        <p>Oddly enough a sizable amount of teenagers are lapping up this garbage like no tomorrow. r/teenagers, Twitter and Instagram comes to mind. They literally think they are going to die and murder tens of thousands the minute they step out their doors. Curiously, they will tear apart evil and dumb conservatives for wanting to reopen society, but won't bat an eye to social justice "protests" with tens of thousands of people in close proximity. Teenagers today, like all teenagers in history, are counter culture, but only if social media and the mob approves of it.</p>
<p>Remember, the internet isn't really the best way of gauging society's opinion on the lockdowns and masks. A few weeks ago I saw bunch of teenagers and young adults at a food truck event in my neighbourhood walking around maskless and happy. The teenagers you see on the internet in favor of this nonsense are likely shut-in losers who do nothing but play video games and badger girls on Discord all day.</p>

        <p>Indeed. Teenagers and young people have been spearheading the resistance in many cases. Opinion in fashionable places online is representative of the subset that is socially elite, lives in big coastal cities, and uses social media a lot, which is a rather small percentage of an entire generation.</p>
<p>Painting all young people with that brush seems to be popular even when it's not accurate. Just look at all the focus on Millennials living in big coastal cities that have or are studying for bachelor's or master's degrees. To look at the popular media you'd think that was almost universal, but in reality most Millennials don't even have a college degree. Something like a third never even went to college. Most aren't on Twitter, and most don't live in big coastal cities.</p>

        <p>When re-opening, many bars had their liquor licenses + a $10,000 fine at stake if they allowed anyone to walk in without a mask. Liquor licenses alone are worth upwards of $100k in some places so 'law enforcement' was actively trying to bust bars all around the country (legalized racketeering).

        <p>It’s so weird to have to wear it just to walk into a place and be able to take it off almost immediately.</p>
<p>I’m happy to take it off, but I was at a Starbucks today, not wearing my mask as I sat with a drink in front of me. Another guy started to walk into Starbucks and was yelled at by baristas before he even made it through the door fully because he wasn’t wearing a mask—it’s ridiculous. Having him walk 10 feet farther into the shop without a mask wouldn’t have hurt any of us. He abruptly turned around and just never ordered anything. Businesses are hurting themselves.</p>

        <p>It’s so so so incredibly dumb. It infuriates me. </p>
<p>I went to a restaurant to celebrate a friend’s birthday. I forgot to bring my mask, because I never remember the damn stupid cloth diaper. My friends were sitting in the back of the restaurant — which would have taken me 10 seconds to walk there. The lady at the front refused to let me walk to the table because I didn’t have a mask. I was like, “it will literally be five seconds.” And she was like sorry, can’t let you, but you can buy a mask to wear. The purchase price? $1 for a mask that cost 10 cents a pop (it was the blue disposable ones). I was like hell no. I ended up having one of my friends bring me a mask just so I could walk to the table. But, miraculously, as soon as you sit down, you don’t have to wear a mask.</p>
<p>Also, this restaurant stopped taking reservations because of the virus. Which only leads to people standing around, waiting for tables in large groups. If they were TRULY concerned about the virus, they would only allow for reservations and no walk-ins so they can make sure there is no bottlenecking at the entrance of the restaurant. The policy of only allowing walk-ones means they are trying to take advantage of as much foot traffic as possible despite reduced capacity restrictions. So all these restrictions and all of these “no reservation” policies isn’t about “safety”, but about wanting to make money and not wanting to be closed down by a government who refuses to believe that the pandemic is over (I live in nyc).</p>

        <p>Maybe if you had not gone in, the punks would have passed you a joint, and the hilarious thing is you might think again about your mask being entirely useless. Punks could learn to share joints without spreading hepatitis by buffering through a mask. I would just tuck the tip of the joint or chillum into a part of the mask material to hit it, but not actually wear it. I mean, now that I think about it, these masks are like sucking our air through cigarette filters all the time. zWhat butt heads. I don't drink but I love getting tight and raving on with friends and this asynchronous kinda stream of conscious convo helps.</p>

        <p>There is no counter-culture, there hasn't been for decades. If it appears on MTV - it ain't bucking nothing, somebody's making a fortune out of it. </p>
<p>Even amongst the self-chosen-exiled, the expat community, where people normally rebel against any idea from authority, there are a huge number of mask-cucks at large. They are afraid and fear of a disease is the best fear of them all because it can, quite literally, never be assuaged without the terrified individual learning to do basic mathematics (which most people can't do - fewer than 50% of school leavers in the West are functionally numerate), thus they are trapped forever until the media gives them permission to stop.</p>
