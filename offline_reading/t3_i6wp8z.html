        <p>Funny that we get crapped on constantly when I see lots of nuanced, empathetic arguments against lockdowns and similar measures - whereas the rabid pro-lockdown or pro-mask people tend to have zero empathy or care for literally any cause except for preventing any/all covid cases (which was NEVER the plan) and sometimes outright wish for people to get sick or die.</p>

        <p>This is because we come from different place to begin with. The pro-mask brigade is terrified and wants to pretend that it's not fear, it's concern for others. This is pretty much the same attitude the Spanish Inquisition took with witches.</p>
<p>We're not afraid. We can see that while this is not "nothing", it's certainly - in the big scheme of things - not enough to live in terror of. That means we can act with empathy and sympathy, but they can't because they're trapped in a nightmare that only they can choose to wake up from.</p>

        <p>They're all just nasty, nasty people who enjoy living in their basements on their sweet sweet extra unemployment, or alternatively brainwashed thinking this has a 100% death rate as soon as you leave your house (which is sad but shows how complete the brainwashing of the public has been).</p>
<p>This ruins lives, destroys lives, and will destroy far, far more than any virus ever could. Everything has been taken away from so many, from permanent employment, from their homes, from being able to socialize, go to church, grieve the dead, experience human LIFE and joy and happiness. Instead - isolation and torture and suicide.</p>

        <p>These were all miserable, insufferable people that no one else wanted to waste their time on before this. I knew this would bring out the worst of the worst in some of the already miserable severe introverts. I wish I wasn‚Äôt right.</p>

        <p>That... You realise that doesn't make it any better, right? And your first comment mentioned no such thing, just openly attacked a suffering child and wished her sick with a virus you wrongly believe is super dangerous and a great threat. You only added that after it was clear people - surprisingly considering the way your attitude is encouraged on reddit - thought you were horrible for it. So no, don't buy it - your feelings were clear from your first comment before you realised others were against you and were not going to join in the mob mentality going around right now. You attacked a <em>child</em>, what is wrong with you?</p>
<p>You're very clearly one of those who wishes this virus on others, others who don't have the same disproportionate fear as you or who don't have the same opinion - people who include experts btw. I would not be surprised if you've made other such comments or 'liked' or 'upvoted' similar comments across social media platforms and worse. </p>
<p>Good thing is this virus is for the majority absolutely harmless. It's not even an effective threat lol. That child you wished sick in your first comment is at more risk from the ordinary flu... and that is still a very low risk.</p>
