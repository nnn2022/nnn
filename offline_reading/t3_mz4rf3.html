        <p>They basically fell into the trap of taking the statistic that averaged all age groups together (and was brought down by people in the 100 range who have a 33%  chance of dying, although they are still a very small portion of all covid cases by virtue of being such a small demographic) instead of realizing how mortality varies by age.</p>
<p>The TV told them covid is super scary and gonna kill us all, so basically they believe it's going to spontaneously generate if two people who don't have it dare to meet outdoors in an isolated spot.  It's essentially magical thinking.  It's so hard for them to even recognize in their own studies it shows an unvaccinated person has all of a 1/40,000 chance of catching covid on a given day.  Or that, healthy people might actually be healthy and not summon covid from the pits of hell to kill them and their grandma if they dare to not follow the rules.</p>
<p>Essentially, they horseshoed back to believing disease is a punishment for blasphemy from germ theory.</p>
