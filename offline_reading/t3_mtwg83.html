<p>I've made this comment once before on this sub - it may be a bit dramatic but I really think this is the case.</p>
<p>I'm not historian but in early 1930's, before shit really hit the fan, most people just went along and didn't see the horror that was coming. I think we're at the same junction right now. People who don't go along are ridiculed, beat up by police, fired or locked up. I believe it's only a matter of time before they declare us "enemies of the state", "a danger to the people" and "terrorists". And that's just the start. We are the jews of the 1930's. As a side note, another interesting fact is that Hitler called the jews "diseased rats".</p>
<p>History, books and movies have warned out countless times for things like this and still the people happily march along, completely oblivious to what's going on and what lies ahead.</p>
