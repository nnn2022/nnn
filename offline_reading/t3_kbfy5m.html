        <p>Yeeeeup. At least Austin. Texas is kind of a small country and many towns simply don’t operate even on a state basis. They operate on a Wild West basis. So basically California liberals will trash Austin but be run out on a rail from many other places in the state.</p>

        <p>Why would anyone love homeless people? I feel bad for them and wish they weren't homeless but I don't like them at all. At least where I am, they're physically aggressive and often won't take no for an answer. I've even seen them get a dollar and demand more.</p>

        <p>I meant love them in the sense of they don’t care where they sleep. There are tents all over the place. I literally smell human shit when I drive into work. And the homeless have gotten much more aggressive as well.</p>

        <p>Ahhhh. I found it interesting because thats my background as well! I majored in Econ looking towards grad school with a focus on growth economics and maybe teaching one day. Grad school student life wasn't for me so I'm in the middle of the CPA pathway now. I can't say that I share your enthusiasm for ayn rand tho haha. What did you major in?</p>

        <p>Nothing.... nothing will occur in response except for the whinging of a minority who in ten years will have decided on another hill to die on, then when progress continues another after that. 
Just like in the 60’s when conservatives promised a civil war if blacks got the vote, absolutely nothing except constant whinging and the finding of a new conservative hill to die on.</p>

        <p>The mass exodus might actually end up benefiting us poor folk here. (Whatevers left of us, a lot of the mass exodus is poor Californians seeking affordable living.) Housing will become affordable here, taxes will go down, goods and services will be cheaper.

<p>Back when I was there (late 2000s), all the old timers hated what it had become. Traffic was already ridiculous. Can't even imagine what it must be like now, with 12 years of non-step tech growth, and now all these heavyweights start moving there? Ugh.

        <p>Maybe California will be able to go conservative again once so many liberals move out and fuck up other states. Seems to me like it will just kind of be cyclical. Eventually the pendulum swings back like how Giuliani ended up NYC mayor after years of bullshit from dem mayors. Eventually enough of the shit leaves allowing for others to come in and clean shit up again.</p>

<p>Our major cities are blue and likely will remain that way while our suburbs and rural are red and will likely remain that way. California is gigantic and has many different economies.</p>
<p>Every place in the nation needs to rethink their economic strategies at this point. Attracting rich people who come in and try to game the system only to leave when it is convenient for them is not really a good long term plan although it works in the short term. </p>
<p>Tech and such industries don't need to be centralized anymore thanks to technology so cities need to adjust accordingly</p>

        <p>Maybe not conservative but like...what’s happening in LA and SF is not sustainable and that’s being headed up by radical left wing politicians. Maybe California doesn’t need a conservative flip but it needs someone not so left wing that they think shitting on the sidewalk and openly shooting up and having places overrun by a homelessness issue while taxing hard workers to death is virtuous because that’s what’s running people out of these places.</p>

        <p>that is LA and SF. The state is much bigger than those two cities.</p>
<p>the reality is a lot of those homeless are from other states. They come here to be homeless and get welfare benefits. </p>
<p>Mostly red states without the economies to support the vast homeless population in America but also blue states that are too cold for the homeless. </p>
<p>The homeless problem has nothing to do with "liberals" and the lax policies surrounding the homeless have to do with saving money. Keeping the homeless on the street and avoiding policing them saves a lot of resources.</p>
<p>If we start housing them, jailing them, or providing mental health facilities it would cost more. </p>
<p>The homeless issue would ideally be solved before those homeless decide to move here. But poor red states don’t have the funding to house these people or stick them in mentsl health facilities or drug rehabs 
so they end up in California. </p>
<p>If we spent what it really cost to house or provide adequate facilities for them people would complain even more about the money. </p>
<p>I can't think of the solution because poverty doesn't go away that easily</p>
<p>also all the rich transplants who moved here and drove up rents and led to homeless/homeless-lite are also to blame as they began pricing the poor out.</p>

        <p>Won’t argue that a lot of red states could do more to balance out issues and I see where you’re coming from with regards to them moving to California to be homeless. I have heard that. But California taxes the hell out of its population and given what people pay to live there, I feel like you’d expect a bit more action taken for these issues. Especially with the current exodus.</p>

        <p>the push to make Los Angeles more conservative actually comes from all the Midwest transplants who left their states to come here. Which is why I'm fascinated by conservatives saying liberals are trying to turn their states blue when actually it is wealthy suburban conservatives who are trying to turn Los Angeles red and push their small town culture onto a hugely diverse city. </p>
<p>the exodus is mostly rich transplants. although some of my poorer friends who are natives want to leave, mainly because they have families and the cost of living is too high. Few of them actually leave of course because they dont have the finances to do it. </p>
<p>Los Angeles' problems could've been foretold as soon as we started getting invaded by Midwestern upper middle class people and then later ultra wealthy entertainment types. </p>
<p>Rich people will always leave as soon as things get rough. They have the power to do so. They come in, drive up rents, invest heavily in their preferred areas, create more density and business, and leave as soon as they don't like something. </p>
<p>For some reason Los Angeles and NYC never thought this far ahead lol! </p>
<p>I just wish people would realize cities can't and never will operate like podunk little towns. </p>
<p>Why? the larger your population the more regulation you have to impose to make things run smoothly. </p>
<p>its the unfortunate consequences of city living. </p>
<p>I hate bipartisan nonsense so I'm always trying to get people to understand the logic behind why major cities are blue.</p>

        <p>I know several California natives who are leaving.</p>
<p>And I don’t at all believe a place like LA should operate like a small podunk town. But allowing petty crimes and rampant homelessness and the trash everywhere on the freeways and the extremely high taxes for very little return aren’t doing these places any favors. LA has not always been like this. I’ve frequented LA 5-6 times per year for 14 years. It did not always look like this. No one is asking LA to be a podunk hick down but asking it to be taken better care of isn’t much. I’ve seen what it can look like when it’s taken better care of than this.</p>

<p>In 2000 I paid 450 dollars for a single in Koreatown. Within a year it went to 600 dollars rent. thats 600 2001 dollars lol. In 2008 it was 1,000. Now it is around 1,800 dollars. These are the same apartments in the same building. The entire area is priced into the 2000 dollar range for single or one bedrooms. </p>
<p>In 2000 that street had daily shootings. Daily. I mean dead bodies in the streets. </p>
<p>It still had shootings in 2008. </p>
<p>It no longer has shootings but it does now have an incredible amount of homeless people all over and even in the buildings. My family, all of whom are native to LA proper will definitely admit homelessness is a much bigger problem than we've ever seen before. </p>
<p>But do not be fooled. Los Angeles was never a "nice" city.   </p>
<p>Again the homelessness has grown because of the increase in the cost of living driven by transplants and people wanting to escape the Midwest for the warm weather. </p>
<p>You don't move to a crime ridden trash can and demand it become a nice clean city if you haven't addressed the rampant poverty that is present and that you contribute to. It is a full blown revenge of the gentrified now. </p>
<p>The transplants erroneously believed they could throw money at this dumpster fire and that they would be rewarded with nice clean shiny streets. </p>
<p>It didn't happen. And they learned the lesson of city life. Now they are fleeing. </p>
<p>It had effects to where not only was LA getting expensive but all of California thought they could charge LA level rents despite not having the jobs or convenience.</p>
<p>This has skyrocketed homelessness and what I call the homeless-lite that is taking over the state. </p>
<p>It sucks but thats what happens when your whole state gets gentrified.</p>

        <p>Well then hopefully no one complains about what it is. I’ve never moved anywhere in an effort to gentrify it. Always known my place and moved to places that have always been white as wonder bread. If people who live in LA like it how it is, then have at it I guess.</p>

        <p>nobody said that. </p>
<p>what was said was don't price people out and then wonder why you see more homelessness. </p>
<p>what happened here had barely to do with liberals and more to do with wealth inequality</p>

        <p>It’s not just the welfare benefits that attract homeless. It’s a hell of a lot easier (seasonally) to be homeless in Cali, Texas, Florida than Minnesota, North Dakota, Wisconsin, Iowa, etc. </p>
<p>If you want to just beg to make money for some food, but primarily booze and drugs, might as well have some nice weather and scenery.</p>

        <p>Definitely. and the state has to allow the homeless to come here because of the freedom of movement between states. </p>
<p>California is fairly powerless in turning away these homeless and also fairly powerless in terms of cutting them off financially. </p>
<p>Its give them a few welfare dollars a month and let them figure it out by building their shanty towns or face a mass starvation and humanitarian crisis on our streets. </p>
<p>We are in a no win position. I left l.a earlier this year because I realized I would probably not be able to afford living there unless I had 11 roommates and no parking lol. </p>
<p>We have tons of homeless here as well. We are a conservative area and town and yet are plagued by homelessness. They cause the same types of issues that they do in the crowded city. </p>
<p>California's temperate weather will always attract the homeless.</p>

        <p>I've thought that for quite some time. Folks need to remember that these are all purely business decisions. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There are only a few people making these decisions and they're purely economical. They have a job to do and legally they are responsible for one thing aside from the myriad compliances and other labor and manufacture legalities, and that's to show shareholders a profit. If on paper them staying in Cali is worse financially than just getting the fuck up and out, well, they have to get the fuck up and out. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When that decision is made, the thousand of blue retards they employee AND whatever swamp spawn they have in their household will follow as they must and become entrenched in the new state and begin to fuck things up now with the main plan being the several generations from now everything being a lock.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just because these awful evil dumbfucks believe and live degenerate blue values 90-99% across the board, the one thing they all believe in is the value of THEIR money and that's where they'll stay as red as possible.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>They'll move red but vote blue and the PTB knows that very well. Some lost tech giants in one area in order to flip the nation blue for good and usher in their long-envisioned plan holds precedence.</p>
<p>I have no doubt in my mind the squeeze is in.</p>

        <p>I don’t think it’s necessarily a concerted effort. Elon Musk, for example, is the richest based person I know of. Probably the only billionaire with actual passion for what he does, not soullessness behind his eyes. And he actually cares about people and this country. Not a lockdowner or even a profit-chaser by billionaire standards in my honest opinion. Yet, the effect of him moving here is absolutely going to be an influx of blue voters and that’s just a fact. If I could, I wouldn’t let him in.</p>

        <p>All it would take then would be Elon naming names and telling people who made California the way it is and why. If people are going to follow Elon Musk into another state, he certainly has influence in how they vote.</p>

        <p>I was thinking the same thing but I think really money is the driver.  California is expensive and the tax rate is insanely high and those things take away from shareholders.  Texas is really really hard to turn blue although it is not out of the question.  But cali could also turn red especially with a mass exodus of liberal population.  Also remember young people grow up and change how they vote, especially if they are moving to a new location that doesn’t jive w their ideals</p>
