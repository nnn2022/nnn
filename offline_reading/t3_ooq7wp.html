    <strong>Unemployment Lies</strong>
    <p><p>I never believed that people were staying on unemployment to get out of working.  Why is it so important that people believe their fellow citizens are lazy moochers?  Is the government/industry trying to shift blame?  Make people forget that the government caused this?</p>
<p>One of my daughters and her boyfriend are both managers at movie theaters.  They are both college students.  Movie theaters were shut down last year and only reopened about a month and a half ago.  My daughter got a paid internship during the lockdown through a professor, but other than that, there were few jobs available.  She said she applied to 50 places during the pandemic and heard back from (and took) one seasonable job at Christmas.</p>
<p>My other daughter got a seasonable job in retail around Thanksgiving/Christmas; they laid her off in February.  She has applied at numerous places and doesn't hear back from anyone.</p>
<p>I've read comments online from people saying they're going through the same thing: Applying at a ton of places and not hearing back from even one.  </p>
<p>I'm going back to school next semester.  They have a work study app.  Out of probably 100 companies, less than 10 are currently hiring.  Actually ... I think I saw 10 job openings total.</p>
<p>I read articles about a trucking shortage ... and then truckers comment that they worked the whole pandemic and no trucker would make more on unemployment than they would driving a hazardous materials tanker.</p>
<p>I read that there is a shortage of waiters ... and then waiters comment that they went out and found actual careers that pay actual money, just like everyone who's against a "living wage" told them to do.</p>
<p>I'm not buying this lie.  My oldest was only on unemployment because the government prevented her from working.  I personally have a theory that (at least in the unskilled, low pay jobs) those jobs were a second income for families, and that someone (usually mom) realized that they weren't making that much money - especially after childcare and gas - at their crap jobs, and it just wasn't worth it.  tbh I don't think those folks are even drawing unemployment, I think they realized they could live without.</p>
<p>Just one more thing to divide us from our neighbors, I guess.</p></p>

        <p>I know in my state, "unemployment ended" the same time as everything opened back up.</p>
<p>For example, movie theaters were completely closed.  Restaraunts were at limited capacity.  </p>

        <p>Some just come right out an say... "I just  filled out the application because I have to...to get benefits." Yes it is very true they say that. It very likely depends on where you're at an the unemployment of that particular state or territory. Call a local chamber of commerce and ask.</p>

        <p>I have a company and am hiring all over the country. I have heard from 99% of applicants I make more than that on unemployment. My jobs are mostly part time at this point because of the “pandemic”. People working for me can earn 30$ to 100$ an hour.  Most earn around the $30 mark based on their production.</p>
