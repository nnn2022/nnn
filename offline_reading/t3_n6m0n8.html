        <p>Seen some news from CNN today on my local tv network. (not from US)  from a hospital in India, 100 peoples needing urgent care and just 60 beds. And yes,it was crowded, peoples sitting on the floor everywhere. </p>
<p>At some moment, the reporter got close to a woman lying on the floor, that was breathing hard and asked her "Are you ok ? Do you need oxygen ? Is the virus bad ?" .. and the woman replied .. "Im ok, just sad because the waiting time is to long" (she was just gasping from crying). Seeing how they tried to push the Covid19 narative like this, for extra drama, it`s disgusting. </p>
<p>Everything going on in India is real, except it`s not Covid19, but by the pandemic protocols created for this .. i don`t even know what to call it anymore .. pseudo virus / exosome / theoretical virus .. because they all fit in perfectly in this "pandemic"</p>

        <p>Whatever is happening, its not the “convenient covid” that turns super virus in Wuhan and then calms down to sub-flu danger that is undetectable. Most likely there are other viruses or poisons that are being distributed by vaccines or some other inconspicuous method.</p>

        <p>India has been a target of the eugenics-loving Rockefeller Syndicate for decades. Dr. Kalokerinos spoke about the real agenda of the WHO in places like India.</p>
<p>“It is hardly necessary to introduce Dr. Kalokerinos. He is well known worldwide as the doctor who spent much of his time fighting for the wellbeing of the Aboriginal inhabitants of Australia.”</p>
<p>“IVN: So <strong>what is your final conclusion</strong> from your experience after so many years?</p>
<p>Kalokerinos: <strong>My final conclusion after forty years or more in this business is that the unofficial policy of the World Health Organisation and the unofficial policy of Save the Children’s Fund and almost all those organisations is one of murder and genocide. They want to make it appear as if they are saving these kids, but in actual fact they don’t. I am talking of those at the very top.</strong> Beneath that level is another level of doctors and health workers, like myself, who don’t really understand what they are doing. <strong>But I cannot see any other possible explanation: It is murder and it is genocide. And I tell you what: when the black races really wake up to what we have done to them they are not going to thank us very much.</strong> And if you want to see what harm vaccines do, don’t come to Australia or New Zealand or any place, go to Africa and you will see it <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/06/28/534403083/mutant-strains-of-polio-vaccine-now-cause-more-paralysis-than-wild-polio">there.”</a></p>

        <p>Thank you for sharing this. (Watch the video in the post. Well worth the 5 minutes.)</p>
<p>This is the kind of stuff Doomers will never, ever address. The collateral damage of this hysteria will never be fully calculated. Ironically, I'm sure a LOT of Grandmas have starved and are about to starve to death, and nary a peep from the MSM for those Grandmas.</p>
<p><strong>Stories like this remind me why I believe in hell for the wicked.</strong></p>
