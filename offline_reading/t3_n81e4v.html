    <strong>All Respect Lost</strong>
    <p><p>Is it just me or can anyone else not watch a movie, tv show or even listen to music without thinking “you’re a scumbag sellout”. </p>
<p>Like all these actors, musicians, comedians etc over the last year and a half helping spread the “get your vaccine” propaganda. </p>
<p>Dolly Parton singing “Vaccine, VACCINE, VACCINE!, VAAACIIIINE” while getting her shot. </p>
<p>Ricky Gervais who I love and thought would be suss and against it all got his shot. </p>
<p>Samuel L Jackson doing that skit poem “Stay the fck at home”  </p>
<p>And I’m sure we all know what a self righteous c*nt Arnold Schwarzenegger has turned into acting like some know all god telling people to stay home and vaccinate. </p>
<p>Then we’ve got that video of Anthony Hopkins faking a drive through vaccination. </p>
<p>I’m just so disappointed that just so many have so obviously and pathetically sold out that it’s hard to disconnect from the world, enjoy a movie, without looking at them thinking “you fcking sellout”</p></p>

        <p>Hollywood is almost entirely liberal. If you are an outspoken conservative you can't get anyway major because you will get black balled. Look what happened to Gina Carano: she said some mild conservative things and got fired from a good gig working on Star Wars.</p>
<p>So I tell myself that at least some of these actors aren't actually morons, they're just playing along so they can keep their career.</p>

        <p>Both parties have their good and bad points. The leaders of both parties want to control us all eventually, just as all the elites do. However currently it is the liberals who actively and overtly stand for anti-freedom and who more consistently lie. You can't necessarily trust either side, but right now conservatives are the only ones who aren't overtly seeking to control us and take our rights away. So if you say anything that questions the liberal narrative you will get attacked.</p>

        <p>Excuse me? I have to take issue with your post since conservatives are trying to ban and backdoor ban birth control, abortion, homosexuality, transgendered, etc.</p>
<p>Yes, the conservatives ARE overtly seeking to control you and take your rights away.</p>
<p>The liberals are admittedly as well but instead of doing it based on "You have to kowtow to my REEEELIGION!" they are doing it based on "Hey... we are concerned about society and the health of same!"</p>
<p>The liberals are going too far... but the conservatives have them beat on the 'too far' by lightyears.</p>

        <p>You live in an echo chamber my dude. Yes there are people in the conservative party who think that way and expect conservative politicians to parrot that thinking, but it is no where near a majority. You are believing the Boogeyman story the left is feeding you about the right to keep you arguing with each other. That's how they get away with everything. They get you treating political parties like your favorite sports team, the other guys are wrong, don't even associate with them, just ignore all the things we do that you don't agree with, they don't matter. Meanwhile you are arguing with "the enemy" on the internet instead of making the elites pay for their bs.</p>

        <p>Yea I don't agree with the religious aspect of republicans, and I support the killing of fetuses. But trying to ban abortion isn't nearly as bad as trying to stop me from being a functioning member of society unless I get a vaccine passport.</p>

        <p>I’m able to disassociate music since I see it as music and not the individual artist performing it, but yeah I struggle much more with tv and movies. I honestly only watch reruns of old things and just reality/documentary shows of normal people these days. I don’t care about celebrities and never will again.</p>

        <p>Oh, yes, absolutely. </p>
<p>A couple of the worst examples are Sleaford Mods who were called "the voice of the working class" coming out in full support of the lockdowns and encouraging their fans to get these new and risky vaccines. (I've come to believe they were pushed into fame to be used this way, actually.)</p>
<p>And then --- Jello Biafra, of Dead Kennedys fame. What an incredible disappointment he grew up to be.</p>
<p>The best thing you can do is start making your own music! If you ever had a desire to do it, it's never been more accessible, more democratized. One of your stimulus checks will get you writing and recording in no time, and there are some great subreddits to help get you started. </p>
<p>Sometimes you have to create the music you want to hear.</p>
<p>And movies? Oh boy, it gets harder and harder to find movies without weird messaging in them. Once you notice key agenda items you see them everywhere. It is ubiquitous. Meanwhile, people who overconsume TV and media in general are so numb they think it's normal.</p>
<p>There's a reason our schools teach conformity and compliance instead of critical thinking, and we're a nation with an epidemic of obesity.</p>
<p>When you start digging into it you find all sorts of things. Here's just one of many example. Look up the average cost of HIV treatment. Once you see that it's $20,000 to $40,000 a year for a person's entire life, now look up HIV transmission decriminalization, and you'll see that our own CDC advises states to decriminalize knowing transmission of HIV. Here's one example:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/10/09/knowingly-infecting-others-with-hiv-is-no-longer-a-felony-in-california-advocates-say-it-targeted-sex-workers/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/10/09/knowingly-infecting-others-with-hiv-is-no-longer-a-felony-in-california-advocates-say-it-targeted-sex-workers/</a></p>
<p>It's happening all over the country. But follow the money, and you'll quickly see why.  Also, if you look up how HIV is transmitted you will figure out while certain sexual behaviors and casual relationships are encouraged. </p>
<p>But the rabbit hole never ends. As you look into the controversy around HIV you should also listen to interviews with Kary Mullis, creator of the PCR test --- and his opinion of Dr. Fauci.</p>
<p>Suddenly you find Fauci at the center of HIV and media blackout around a truly incredible controversy.</p>
<p>But this is just a couple of issues out of an endless list.   </p>
<p>This is why they are training people to dismiss anyone who doesn't believe everything they see on TV as a "conspiracy theorist." It's a dehumanization technique to keep people deep in the matrix.</p>

        <p>Its probably eye opening to those not really engaged, but hollywood has been doing this literally forever?</p>
<p>The actors aren't famous for their outstanding moral character... They act well, are charismatic, and are paid huge $$$ to sell products. These are the same people who won't speak ill of chinese atrocities.</p>
