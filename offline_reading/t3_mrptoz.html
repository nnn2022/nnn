    <strong>Hi guys, I think I'm slipping into insanity with all this... can you help?</strong>
    <p><p>99.96% of us agree that COVID as well as the variants exist. However recently I'd been listening to a conspiracy channel and they make a very convincing case that its all, ALL fake. I feel like the rug is being pulled from under my feet. Like I knew they were overblowing it a little but what if it <em>is</em> all fake? Just how rotten is the system then and how is it even possible to live in such a world, even if the pandemic does end all day? </p>
<p>So I have just one request, can anyone please help me get reassured that Covid does exist? I've tried searching for proof but haven't found anything solid, only pages that say "trust the experts on this one".</p></p>

        <p>lmao. why do you need the virus to be real?</p>
<p>for all i know, it’s lockdown-induced mass immunosuppression/economic depression and propaganda driven hysteria and despair that caused what we are attributing to sars cov 2.</p>
<p>there definitely is no pandemic.</p>
<p>but whether sars cov 2 is real...frankly, i’m not 100% sure.</p>
<p>i question any and everything, though. i think i’m in the minority here.</p>

        <p>Real proof doesn't exist, it never does</p>
<p>But this goes both ways. There is no 'real proof' that covid exist, but there's also no 'proof' it doesn't exist</p>
<p>Believing is something else. If you believe covid doesn't exist, and you shouldn't follow any rules or what so ever. Than something probably proves to you that it doesn't exist. But if you believe covid is real, than there is probably something you think proves that</p>

        <p>Me too.</p>
<p>How has the flu disappeared, yet covid is rampant, yet covid can be tested out of a fucking papaya? I think a LOT of people die every year from the flu, some years are worse than others, and this year was no exception.</p>
<p>Edit: question I haven't heard anyone ask, anywhere: why aren't all of the deaths tested for both covid AND the flu?</p>

        <p>They stopped testing for flu in my state back in April of last year. I know that's true in many other states as well. Wouldn't be the least bit surprised if this is also the case across most of the world. </p>
<p>That's why the flu "disappeared". It didn't go anywhere. Hospitals and doctor's offices just stop testing for it. </p>
<p>Also, the PCR test that many places are using will simply come back as "positive". No indication of what they're "positive" for. It just means there is possibly some sort strain of <strong>flu</strong> or coronavirus present in the persons body. That's right a positive PCR could very well be a positive flu test.</p>

        <p>Well, there definitely is an illness going around, because the ICUs in Ontario are pretty full, but I think cases of flu/pneumonia may also be being recorded as cases of COVID. I know some people who had COVID and they say it felt different from a normal cold or flu, though.</p>

        <p>How did it feel different? Is it possible that just because they thought it was the china virus, they experienced it differently?</p>
<p>For example, I read that the majority of people claiming to have had long china virus actually had anxiety and depression caused by their perception of the virus. Some of them were miraculously cured after getting the vaccine because, in their mind they perceived it as a miracle cure. The mind is a powerful thing.</p>

        <p>That's possible... since I'm not them, I wouldn't really know if that was the case, LOL. I think I had it in 2019 and it felt different (but I didn't know what it was then), although I never took a test so I won't know now.</p>

        <p>Yeah the Sally Fallon Morell / Tom Cowan Contagion Myth sounds right to me. They are considered major quacks but that lady was right about butter and the lipid hypothesis. Also always right about bacteria. I think we may misunderstand viruses just like we misunderstood fats and bacteria for many years. Hubris, corruption, predation, ignorance. Viruses are a part of life just like bacteria, you just can’t go scorched earth and play god with more toxic garbage without repercussions. If deadly viruses this powerful can just pop up how is anything alive? Does nature not have delicate interconnected balanced systems that for the most part support life?? Nothing makes sense I have also lost my marbles.</p>

        <p>There's a theory that we message each other with exosomes (similar to virus in appearance) that we exchange and that we signal each other to detoxify.  Something like that.  We get ill when we detox.  It does make sense.  Listen to Zach Bush.  He's a cool dude...not a conspiracy theorist (not that there's anything wrong with that).  I can't see how that works out with covid though.  It's just too unique.  I'm a respiratory therapist with 22 years experience in critical care, and I've not seen anything like this.  There are several things to point out, but just the loss of taste and smell alone is odd.  Also, there's a lot of micro clotting as well as the happy hypoxia...something I've never ever seen.  People come in with o2 sats of 75% and they don't even feel it too much.  If that were you or I a year ago, we'd be gasping and breathing at 60 per minute.  I will say though that I am not 100% convinced either way.  I simply don't trust anything anymore.  I don't have an electron microscope nor the knowledge to test their claims, either way.  To some degree, to believe anything takes faith.  It's a super bizarre world.</p>

        <p>We will never know if it really exists. The reason is because an experiment of this magnitude has never been run before. You’ve heard of the placebo effect- well there is also the “nocebo effect” which says that if you tell a group of people they are going to get sick, a certain percentage will really get sick. The mind can literally change biology. 8 billion people were told that there is a deadly virus spreading across the globe, so yeah.. a lot of people are going to get sick.</p>

        <p>To be honest; the facts are that covid is no more deadly than your average flu, it makes no difference to hospitalization rates than what the annual flu does....  so it doesn’t matter whether it’s tea or not.  It makes no difference whether it is or isn’t.  All we know is that the media is exaggerating as well as outright lying about covid to fear monger and push government control.  I actually see it as semantics whether covid factually exists or not and don’t care.</p>
