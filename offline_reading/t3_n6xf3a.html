        <p>What a dumb fuck...</p>
<p>So, I was on the biggest rally last year in Berlin. It was completely peaceful and had a very Woodstock type vibe. People were singing and dancing.</p>
<p>Guess what the media made out of it?</p>
<p>Surprisingly similiar story to your storm of the capitol.</p>
<p>Violence and Nazis storming the Reichstag.</p>
<p>The Violence however turned out to be from a completely different demostration (its not rare that there are 100 demos in Berlin over just one weekend), were locals were demonstrating the closing of a local pub and ended up injuring 50+ cops.</p>
<p>The Storm, was also a completely different demonstration with roughly 300 members, stationed right before the Reichstag. While the actual "Querdenker" Demo was a couple streets away with roughly 200.000 attendances.</p>
<p>Was kinda funny to read the news about violence and all while being on the demonstration and experiencing fake news while they happend.</p>
<p>Sad was that literally no media was able to figure out that they were mixing 3 different demonstrations into one, despite each having different hosts and goals and occupations.</p>
<p>Also sad was that (some) friends would believe the media-narrative over the eye-witness testimony by a long time friend.</p>
