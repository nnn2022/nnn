    <strong>I went on vacation and got sick. Now what? (No shit Sherlock edition)</strong>
    <p><p>I, a filthy unvaxed who has hardly ever been out of my home state, caught the sniffles after crossing two state lines to attend a family gathering/party, where I hugged and laughed and smiled more than I have in years. Terribly tragic.</p>
<p>So I did the responsible thing and quarantined with the person I travelled with, and away from my elderly father. </p>
<p>I accepted the risks as a healthy individual and protected my loved ones of my own accord. Because I have agency, I am responsible for myself, and I can take care of my business without government interference.</p>
<p>Fear of (what turned out to be) the mildest cold I've ever had isn't going to get in the way of living my life as I see fit.</p>
<p>As a side note, my mother had a flying fit about it and insisted I get tested. Maybe I'll get the antibody test later on, but I don't need my name attached to some record over a head cold. </p>

        <p>Sad that we live in a world in which personal responsibility is evaporating.  For the past 60,000 years of human existence, “don’t go around other people if you’re sick” was good enough.</p>
