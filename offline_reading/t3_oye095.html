    <strong>I'm scared of being forced to take the vaccine soon by family</strong>
    <p><p>I'm scared of being forced to take the vax soon. I'm only 15 and healthy, and don't want to take it as I'm against mandatory vaccinations and restrictions , and because I am not at risk of covid. my close family all took their covid vaccines and said they felt like shit for a couple of days after taking it, and where I live they are finishing the stage of vaccinating 18-25 year olds and starting to move on to my age range. some of my friends somehow have already taken it and had to take time off school because of symptoms, I don't see why I have to make myself sick to protect me from an illness that would have the same, if not milder, symptoms on me.</p>
<p>my family doesn't know I have this opinion though and I'm scared that when/if I tell them I don't want it, they would flip out and start to hate me. two of my cousins refused to have it and my family constantly talks about how "stupid" they are, even though they both graduated from university and have been smart and friendly people all their lives. when I get offered the vaccine I don't know whether I'll just get it even though I really don't want to just to avoid being rejected by my family, or if I'll refuse it and potentially risk not being allowed to go see family members anymore, constant arguments, not being cooked food anymore ect. I've already seen how my parents's opinion has turned on my cousins because they didn't take the vaccine and I really don't want that to happen to me, but I also really don't want the vaccine, im scared and have no idea what to do.</p></p>

        <p>I know it's wrong but its very scary for me that I may completely fall out with my family who I do love extremely much. it's sad seeing my parents turn against my cousins but I have no idea how they'd react if their own son refused it, and it's also sad that I have to worry about how extreme their views are now. as far as they know when I go out im always wearing masks and washing my hands every 2 seconds, but they don't know most of the time I'm not wearing masks at all and I'm really scared of the vaccine.</p>
<p>it's really hard to think about my family rejecting me over something silly like this. I have 1 more year of school so it's not as if I can move out yet either, I have nowhere near the money for it neither can I drive or legally have a job. im really hoping they end up doing booster shots for older adults again instead of doing under 18s as there is talk of that happening where I live or that they'll just vaccinate under 18s at risk but idk what's gonna happen.</p>

        <p>I'm going to take a risk my friend. I'll probably get ridiculed and attacked for some of what I share below.</p>
<p>It IS scary, very much so, and I hear that you love your parents very much.</p>
<p>It is unfortunately, probably safe to assume, they would react in a similar way to you.</p>
<p>The hard to bear reality is, that they are failing you, terribly. They are doing terrible harm to you and the world through misguided good intentions, and chosen ignorance.</p>
<p>They embody the very thing, the very failings within "good people", the enabling, weakness and cowardice, the denying of truth which they carry in their heart.... That has been the very thing - that has permitted evil to occur again and again throughout history.</p>
<p>They have failed the test of history, of these times. And the only thing that will potentially help them, is you standing in your integrity, in truth.</p>
<p>You see the truth, you feel it. And you must be strong, you are duty bound to do so, we must ALL step up, to stand by the river of truth, to do the right thing, no matter the cost.</p>
<p>I am so sorry that they fail you so terribly.</p>
<p>And the risky part.... to share a little about myself. Not to diminish your challenges in anyway to be clear, your challenges ARE significant and my love and respect goes to you.</p>
<p>I was raped, tortured from babe to adult, and faced and witnessed terrible deaths also.</p>
<p>I had to "do the right thing" as my heart showed me, ultimately to not partake despite the terrible forces trying to turn me into something like them, resisting such machinations often carried a terrible cost to myself and others...</p>
<p>I would not speak of your duty to yourself and the world lightly, nor from some safe and cosy imagined reality where I am not also being called again and again, to plant myself like a tree beside the river of truth.</p>
<p>The world needs people to rest into their knowing, to do the right thing, no matter the cost.</p>
<p>There is always a cost, and we are seeing the cost of such compromise all around us, it is why the world is in this state in the first place, why such lies so easily take root.</p>
<p>Doing the right thing, as your heart knows it, is the only thing that will save us, and this (with your parents) it seems is your chosen battlefield, the place where you must make a stand.</p>
<p>BE the change.</p>
<p>Much love to you my friend ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè</p>

        <p>Really sit them down and let them seriously know this is your choice and you don‚Äôt want to take the vaccine.</p>
<p>If they refuse to respect your boundaries, at 16 I think you can be emancipated if you have the evidence outside of being resistant to the vaccine. Tbh if your parent‚Äôs are forcing decisions on you like this I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they‚Äôd done other things to you that weren‚Äôt right either.... </p>
<p>I‚Äôm so sorry your having to go through this as a young child. </p>
<p>You have every right to say no and have your choices respected. If there is no mandate in place, you should still be able to say ‚Äòno.‚Äô </p>
<p>This isn‚Äôt right for the government to force people to take vaccines and it isn‚Äôt right for your parents to force you to take this experimental drug. </p>
<p>I would resist the best you can, you‚Äôre taking a stand for your freedom. Stay safe.</p>

        <p>where I live I legally can't get a job yet, I have 1 more year of school, I can't drive, and all the family I have is so close that if I go live with them they'll know exactly where I am.

        <p>I dont know you and i dont know the tolerance of your parents. You can resist or stretch your time but when you reach the end and they force you to get vax then you have to take it. Youre still living with them and they're feeding you. Youre still young and dependent on them. Its not your time to fight. </p>
<p>I know ill get downvoted for saying that. Its easy for me to say to stand your ground and dont take the vax ever. Or I can say to leave your house and your family but i know youre the one who will suffer...not me.</p>

        <p>that's what I'm concerned about, I still have a couple years until im legally an adult so if I refuse the vaccine they could just say they won't buy me food or drive me to places I have to go to, and I can't do that myself because I can't drive or have a job yet. I don't want to but in the end I think I probably will end up having the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Legally they are responsible for you until your 18 they can't deny you food or shelter. You could actually get a public representative and take them to court. My mother and aunts did that to my grandparents because they were pos that kicked them out before they were 18. They won and were awarded child support and stayed with one of my aunts that were over 18. Whatever you choose to do I wish you the best.</p>

        <p>I wish the best for you. I wonder, is there someone in your family that is also skeptical of this and would be willing to back you up and even shelter you when things get worse. </p>
<p>I was just so lucky that I could work if at all, and was in my last year when this whole thing happened and I was able to quickly bail out and get myself into a position where none of this affected me much.</p>

        <p>Bill them for the damages should they come. You‚Äôll probably be fine, but you were fine before getting vaccinated so there‚Äôs literally no need to introduce that risk to you. You can never take away what the vaccine puts into you and at almost EVERY risk profile, vaccination is riskier in the long run.</p>

        <p>Any true parents will still love their child, whether vaccinated or not. I would consider writing them a letter explaining your feelings. Leave the letter for them in a place they will find it, or give it to them and leave to a different room before they have a chance to read it.</p>
<p>Letters can feel less confrontational, helps you to organize your thoughts while writing it, and also allows them to have more time to process their thoughts instead of needing to have an instant response to a conversation in real time.</p>

        <p>I'm happy you haven't had any side effects and I don't mind other people want to get the vaccine, but almost everyone I know who got it has had a couple days being sick because of it. I don't mind other people getting it and I even encourage some people really at risk to get it, but it should be a choice for everyone to make for themselves without being judged by their family and society for it</p>

        <p>Idk about you but I find the fact that people are still getting sick after the vaccine makes me even skeptical. What vaccine in history has been released to the public with this many side effects? If they cared about our health, don‚Äôt you think they would have properly tested the vaccine was safe and effective before prematurely releasing it to the public? How alarming. </p>
<p>Besides, the vaccine has proven not to work anyways and they already have the vaccinated in the hospital spreading Covid. They are already telling people to mask up again. </p>
<p>Don‚Äôt trust the governments vaccines they are forcing on people, its being forced and pushed onto people to encourage their submission to the system. Its about abolishing freedom, money, and dividing and contouring. You‚Äôll catch onto the game the more you pay attention.</p>

        <p>Interesting I‚Äôve heard a bunch of women on the r/period subreddit are having loss of their mensural cycles and inflammation of their uterus due to the vaccines. If your have endometriosis the inflammation could cause infertility. </p>
<p>I wonder what other side effects they‚Äôll find come time with this experiment?</p>
<p>Edit: For anyone that wants to know just search ‚Äòvaccine‚Äô or ‚Äòvaccinations‚Äô on that subreddit and you‚Äôll find posts about it. Really life side effects.</p>
