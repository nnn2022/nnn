    <strong>BBC Bullshit - Merseyside Covid-19 hoax-claim salon to be visited by police</strong>

<p>“<strong>A beauty salon that banned coronavirus talk and said Covid-19 does not exist is being investigated by police.</strong></p>
<p>Skin Kerr salon in Bootle put posters in its window and posted online stating masks weren't being worn by staff as "you can't catch what doesn't exist".</p>
<p>Merseyside Police said officers would visit the salon on Aintree Road to "remind" the owner and staff of their responsibilities around Covid-19.</p>
<p>The shop window posters and social media posts have now been taken down.</p>
<p>Sefton Council said its environmental health team will also visit and the owners are due to meet with the council on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Cabinet member Councillor Paulette Lappin said the salon's stance was "disappointing".</p>
<p>"If the situation cannot be resolved satisfactorily during this meeting, and we are not satisfied that measures to keep customers and staff safe are in place, we will consider taking formal enforcement action," she said.”</p></p>
