        <p>I can't comment on Conspiracy so I'll post this here. Coming from someone who voted Brexit, I now have serious concerns that it was indeed meant to happen and that it serves an ulterior motive.</p>
<p>Put it this way, before Trump was elected there was a very real chance of a TTIP deal under Hillary Clinton that would have meant an economic union between North America and Europe. I suspected at the time that the UK could have been the link in the chain as it were with Londons financial sector acting as the interchange.</p>
<p>Well Trump came, and I'm not so sure about Biden's views on the TTIP, but the world's a fundamentally different place now anyway. What I do know is that London and the Bank of England in particular has been very involved in developing the financial aspects of the UNs sustainability drive and blockchains. Time will tell but I strongly suspect the result of the COP26 this November will be carbon tariffs (a global tax system paid directly to the WEF and UN "Stakeholders") which perhaps London's financial district will be processing.</p>

        <p>Some of the major powers of the world are in London as you know, most of these wanted the UK to stay in the EU.  However, now that Brexit has happened they are replanning, but of course eventually they want the UK back in the EU, with democracy shut down.</p>

        <p>Sure, others trying to do the same thing, this is not about good guys or bad guys, but the fact BRICS seems to be a target is evidence of who is really behind Covid</p>
