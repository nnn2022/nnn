        <p>I've even told one cosplay photographer who is "sad but glad" that dragoncon 2020 got turned into a virtualcon that 2021 in america will be a lot worse because of economic and civil strife and its not going to better.</p>
<p>His response: "I'm continue to look forward to it" with a stupid 'thumbs up' emoji.</p>
<p>Hes only delusionally positive as a coping mechanism. How the fuck can anyone be excited for 2021 to be better when everything fell apart?</p>

        <p>You misunderstand. I don't hold such a delusion that 2021 will be a particularly great year. In fact I expect it to be bad. Probably not as bad as 2020, but it won't be good. The US dollar's inflation is going to hit us like a truck, there'll probably still be Covid cultists running around ruining lives. Overall it's going to suck.</p>
<p>I just don't care. I've already been at rock bottom. I've already been a split second away from death. Not even Hell itself could drag me back down to that. </p>
<p>You don't need money. You don't need social clout. You don't even need to try to influence other people. Simply improving yourself will improve the people around you. I'm done worrying about things I can't control. </p>
<p>Trying to control the uncontrollable is how we got into this mess in the first place.</p>

        <p>Ok, I’ve heard others say they’ve hit rock bottom and realize they just dont care and don’t worry about anything anymore . . but it’s really very vague about what you actually do. </p>
<p>The problem is, We want to DO something and work to make life better, but there’s nothing anymore.
I have nothing resembling a social life. 
My job is online data entry. I do it at home now and probably will forever so I dont even get association from any coworkers. </p>
<p>I can’t travel, can’t even socialize with strangers in the supermarket because masks, people are all suspicious and won’t say two words anymore. Plus I have some hearing impairment and can’t understand a lot of times due to not seeing their lips anymore. </p>
<p>So now what? Just sitting at home on my couch watching tv for the rest of the year and most of 2021? How do I feel content with that? I’m genuinely asking because I don’t know how to do that, please help me understand. Im not worrying, I just find it very despairing. 
Go to ReallyGraceful on Instagram. Her story today says it perfectly.</p>

<p>What you're trying to say is "just do it" "just do something about it" to make it better despite having no money or clout.</p>

        <p>If "it" is referring to covid, then no. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about being a better person in general. What that exactly entails, I can't tell you. Because I am not you. You have to find that answer for yourself. </p>
<p>It wasn't good people that spread the fire and brimstone with covid. It was the sick, angry, and overall dystopian people that did that. The kind of annoying nihilists that never shut the fuck up about how nothing matters and that we should all just kill ourselves.</p>
<p>Don't be like them. That mindset leads to nothing but ruin. I should know. I used to be the same.</p>
