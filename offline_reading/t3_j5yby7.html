<title>TIL a new word - “Anosognosia” - meaning the lack of awareness of a deficit, limitation or harm. Kept in deliberate ignorance of the facts, most of us can now be diagnosed properly with the ultimate ‘false positive’.</title>

    <strong>TIL a new word - “Anosognosia” - meaning the lack of awareness of a deficit, limitation or harm. Kept in deliberate ignorance of the facts, most of us can now be diagnosed properly with the ultimate ‘false positive’.</strong>
    <p><p>“Anosognosia is a deficit of self-awareness, a condition in which a person with a disability is unaware of having it.”</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosognosia">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosognosia</a></p>
<p>“One of my favorite medical terms, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQq9wj6yHIk"><strong>anosognosia</strong></a>, means lack of awareness of a deficit. I have come to find this useful in description of so many of my colleagues who practice the medicine they were trained to practice without conscious acknowledgement of its gross limitations and even hazards.</p>
<p><strong>Relatedly,</strong> <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160105-the-man-who-studies-the-spread-of-ignorance"><strong>agnotology</strong></a> <strong>is the study of the propagation of ignorance. It is the meme-ification, societally, of coverups, half-truths, and misinformation. Simple catch phrases parroted in an echo chamber. It’s the creation of a mirage of information, often accomplished through concerted efforts like those described by journalist Sharyl Attkisson, as</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bYAQ-ZZtEU"><strong>astroturfing</strong></a><strong>.”</strong></p>

<p>I first came across this word when researching the hazardous HPV vaccine that all the 14/15 year olds at my school will be receiving this Thursday, but I think it applies to almost everything that’s occurring at the moment - all the components of the New Normal - COVID, lockdowns, government overreach, communitarianism, affirmative action legislation, masks and vaccines. Out of ignorance, fear, guilt and trauma, most of us are simply unable to see the downside to certain courses of action.</p>
<p>The only test? Do you think current countermeasures are proportionate to the dangers? If you answered yes, you’re anosognosic. Seemingly incurable and potentially fatal, but...</p>
<p>... there is a dangerous, complicated and experimental tripartite cure - conducting ones own research, immersion in the totality of available information and turning off the TV.</p></p>

        <p>“Anosognosia” is a word used to justify forcing mental health treatment on people: the "so-and-so refuses to take the drugs because they're too crazy to know they're crazy" argument, a convenient end run around the concept of informed consent in medicine. I suppose it will soon be trotted out to describe anyone not blindly trusting of the official coronavirus narrative, if it hasn't been used that way already.</p>
