        <p>You're still missing the point. The study might be right, even your new magical 0.04% number might be right. But looking as the fatality rate is stupid if you don't look at the number of infected. (which btw is 31M in the usa alone). 500 000 deaths in 2020 is 10x more than the 2019 flu deaths. Even if you took your 0.04% (3x less than 0.15), that's about 166 000 covod deaths, still 3x more than the flu in 2019. Covid infects more people than other viruses, that's what makes it dangerous. Even with a low fatality rate, it kills a lot.</p>

        <p>Do you know why it (is meant) to infect more people? Because that "science" has changed too. Bet ya didn't know, I'll actually be surprised if you knew the first part not how it's changed too.</p>

        <p>Regular flu kills  290,000 and 650,000 people a year and we never bat an eye.  Give the world population is 8 billion, it's still a very small percentage of that, and it's mostly in older people who would die from things like pneumonia and flu anyhow.  It is more deadly than flu, but  not necessarily more deadly than pneumonia, just more common.</p>
<p>Eating yourself to an early grave is far deadlier, but we also are pretty okay with that in the US just because it's a long, slow death.</p>
<p>Also the overdosing issue killed more people in Seattle or LA, one of those West coast places, than covid did, which is pretty impressive for another problem we're fine passing over.</p>

        <p>So covid killed 10x more and we shouldn't bat an eye either? What's your point? 3Million ppl aren't important? Old people with families who could've lived a couple more years dying isn't important? Imagine if your relatives died from covid and some guy tells know we shouldn't "bat an eye". You're a piece of work mate. </p>
<p>I'm not saying the way we reacted to covid was perfect, and yeah lockdown had shitty side effects. But bear in mind that 500 000 deaths was WITH the lockdown. There would have been many more without. Maybe less overdoses, sure, but how are you ment to choose between the two.</p>

        <p>What makes those 300,000 people so worthless we don't shut down the whole world for them?  What if one of the flu deaths were your relative?  What a piece of work you are, mate.  Only caring about covid deaths.</p>
<p>The point is that a war on death is pointless.  We should protect people, or at least offer ways for them to protect themselves. I don't think you owe anyone else their safety, it's a violation of autonomity.  If you had a rare bloodtype that could save a dying child, or even a bunch of them, does the government have a right to harvest your blood to help them or do you have the right to say no, even if it will doom them?  I don't agree you're obligated to save anyone else's life.</p>
