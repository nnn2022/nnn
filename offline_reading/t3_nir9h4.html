    <strong>We're singing to the Choir, and need to change.</strong>
    <p><p>I get it can be tough to air our thoughts in other subreddits or other social media platforms, but I've come to realize that while we find comfort in finding comrades here in r/NoNewNormal, we really need to branch out and start doing our part in voicing our concerns with certain actions taken-up by our respective governments. It felt a bit refreshing airing my concerns in r/Canada and r/OnGuardForThee, and of course the plethora of downvotes and personal attacks came swooping-in, but it's on par for the course. Do your part everyone, stand-up for your principles! If you see a post that contradicts actual science or talks about something that will eventually lead to a further loss of our freedoms &amp; liberties, then say something! Do something! Don't stand-by while watching this shit-show clown world continue to tumble-off towards the cliff-edge.</p></p>

        <p>This post needs to reach 100,000 upvotes. </p>
<p>This is the single most vital thing everyone anywhere needs to understand. I know first hand that even if someone doesn’t like what you have to say, it can eventually lead to them changing down the road, I’ve seen it happen. </p>
<p>My hand hurts sometimes for how much I share in random places across the web, but for now we have that freedom so let’s exercise the hell out of it before they take it away. They will take it away at some point, and our words of warning will have been heard by many so they will know at the crux of the new world order being ushered in, they will be able to use all we’ve told them to wake up. </p>
<p>It’s an arduous battle, one which you’re never actually going to seem to win, but know that the ripples of our words do echo in their minds for some time so never give up!</p>

        <p>Do it in person.   We went to the laundromat without masks on.  This old woman kept looking over at us.  She...  looked like she was confused?   Or about to cry..  I wasn’t sure.  So I went over and asked if she was ok.  She ripped off the mask and the tears broke.  She asked Can I hug you?  I’ve been terrified.  Uhh..  sure.    </p>
<p>I let her cling to me and cry.   She got it together.  Threw the mask in the trash and said thank you.</p>
<p>Be nice.</p>

        <p>I agree, I have been banned from a few so far, but there's got to be something we can do to at least expand our circle. I just fear we're just all huddled in this subreddit of ours, bracing against the storm outside, but eventually the roof of our place will fly-off, and before that happens, I just wanted to share my thoughts to the community before the dreaded ban-hammer comes. There are active users out there that want our subreddit banned (e.g. r/NoNewNormalBan is just one of several). Where can we go after this?</p>

        <p>Agreed, I’m making progress with some at work, but I’ve already been outed by a few &amp; so I’ve unfortunately made a few enemies along the way, but I have met a few like-minded individuals and so that’s a win in my book. I try my best to speak to people when I’m shopping, but it’s hard to strike up a conversation while shopping for food.</p>

        <p>Yeah, you just get banned from other subreddits for saying literally anything that isn't perfectly in line with the narrative, so.... can't really do what you're saying if you care about fake internet points you can't do anything with.

        <p>Regional subs like Canada are not representative of normal opinion. Over there, we content with the <em>very online</em>, and they aren’t here for discussion. You do find some normals there tho, buried deep in controversial. OGFT is an actual cesspit. It’s a study in the breathtakingly unsuccessful NEETs in our country</p>

<p>Hey have you ever read a vaccine insert ? My kid was harmed bad by this one - look we won a stay at the children’s hospital because of it/ shut up you dirty liar all vaccines are safe. </p>
<p>That’s what I’m up against. With Covid. With masks. They have BLIND faith and don’t want to hear anything else</p>

        <p>There are some sub-reddits that really don't want to hear it. They are convinced that what the CDC, Fauci and their collaborators say is gospel. While yeah, we should plant the seed in their ear, we can not force them to change their mind. The onus is on them to do their research and part. We can open the door, we can not make them go through it.</p>

        <p>My initial reason why I don’t want the vaccine for myself was that like all new drugs it’s been tested by experimenting on animals. I cannot justify taking a medicine to extend my life when I know it’s been created by inflicting untold suffering on other life forms. Especially when COVID supposedly came from keeping animals in dreadful conditions in a wet market (as all
diseases that jumped from animals to humans in the last 100+ years have come from keeping animals in bad conditions i.e bird flu, swine flu, mad cow etc) I feel like nature is trying to tell us something but our way out is just to exploit more animals this time via the Pharmaceutical Industry. Well I personally wanted no part of it and there was a time I was scared I was going to be forced to take the vaccine which would be completely against my personal ethical code and I posted this in r/vegan as I was feeling like I was the only person who felt this way about taking the vaccine and wanted to know if anyone else felt like this or had even considered the animal testing aspect. </p>
<p>I was very polite and said I know my views on not wanting to take pharmaceutical products is probably on the extreme side but was wondering what other peoples views were. Well every single responder on there said they would be fine taking it and I got a lot of abuse and got called a troll and was told I wasn’t a vegan and should be ashamed of myself and that I was killing people by not taking it.</p>
<p>I know a lot of people don’t care about animal experiments like I do (and I don’t expect them to as everyone has an individual ethical code) but for that reaction to happen on a vegan subreddit, I was not prepared for. I don’t understand how it’s vegan to not kill an animal for meat, but it’s ok to kill and torture them to take a medicine 90%+ will never need and put tons of cash in Pharma’s pocket - an industry that has a dreadful record of animal abuse and links to companies such as Monsanto and Agri-Chem companies which are destroying our wildlife from pumping loads of chemicals everywhere, GMO’s etc.</p>
<p>I really think we need a system change to treat other lives both human and animal with respect and stop exploiting others, otherwise these zoonotic outbreaks will keep occurring. All the vaccine does is mask these symptoms but it does not address the fundamental cause so nothing will really change.</p>
<p>As humanity we require a mindset shift where we take a harsh look at our actions and always try and analyse the impact we are having. Unfortunately I don’t think this is coming as this pandemic has shown. So many people are manipulated by fear and guided by their baser emotions.</p>
<p>At least in this sub people can see through the crap and have the courage of their convictions and have a good internal locus of control. I do fear the echo chamber effect, but it’s so difficult to try and speak to others to even get them to start questioning anything.</p>

        <p>I had a small victory today on r/covidiots and even got an award but the most vocal poster was the main reason I got some to hear me. She went straight to hurling insults and calling me out for being part of this sub and other "alt right" subs. But I agree with you! It sucks but if we can present an eloquent argument some will listen. Making another account is probably a good way to avoid discrimination tho</p>

        <p>That's great to hear! I'm glad you were able to make some conversation on that subreddit (I don't think they like us here at NoNewNormal LOL). To be honest, I've already been banned from places like WorldNews or Gardening (LOL), but it can't be helped. If someone is egging me on then I'll provide some links, give my explanation, and hope that seed of knowledge will grow in that person I'm conversing with (unless it's a bot or troll).</p>

<p>It would be nice to start a thread or sub, even a webpage to keep it clean where we compile all of our links, studies, articles etc and attempt to connect the dots as well as we can for people.  </p>
<p>And people on this side are pretty good at sifting through bs and bad science/sites so we could use the iron sharpens iron technique to start off well.</p>
<p>Sometimes I just wanna give up tho. Lol or head down south where they still see to have some freedom. Our PM isnt himself scary, but hes definitely working for those who want to enslave us all.</p>
