        <p>article in theglobeandmail a few days ago:
"Mosque, synagogue leaders in Alberta call on GraceLife Church to follow COVID-19 rules"</p>
<p>JASON FRANSON/THE CANADIAN PRESS</p>
<p>Leaders with a mosque and a synagogue in Edmonton have a message for an area Christian church that has been routinely holding services that violate COVID-19 restrictions.</p>
<p>While they sympathize with GraceLife Church’s desire to bring worshippers together, they are asking its pastor and congregants to trust Alberta’s public-health rules.</p>
<p>“I would encourage (GraceLife) to just consider, contemplate and reflect upon what God would want them to do in terms of caring for others, especially vulnerable Albertans,” says Jamal Osman, vice-president of the Muslim Community of Edmonton Mosque.</p>
<p>Virtual churches, real prayers: How COVID-19 is changing the holy seasons</p>
<p>The province and Alberta Health Services are not stopping those at GraceLife from practising their faith, he says.</p>
<p>“They’re just saying, ‘make sure there is social distancing’.”</p>
<p>Before the pandemic, up to 300 Muslims squeezed into the mosque for a service every Friday, which is a sacred day of worship in Islam, Osman says.</p>
<p>Muslims typically pray standing shoulder-to-shoulder, he adds. Letting go of years of communal practice was difficult when COVID-19 hit, but the community understood.</p>
<p>“It’s not our place to agree or disagree with another faith group and what they choose to do. I would just encourage (GraceLife) to consider the health and safety of everybody else.”</p>
<p>Zolly Claman, a rabbi at Edmonton’s Beth Israel Synagogue, lost his father-in-law to the virus early in the pandemic.</p>
<p>He says gathering is of the utmost importance in Judaism, and it’s a struggle to keep up with religious practice while working within public-health guidelines.</p>
<p>“But COVID-19 regulations are designed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and they definitely need to be followed.”</p>
<p>GraceLife Church in Spruce Grove, just west of Edmonton, along with its pastor, James Coates, are to appear in court in May. They are charged with violating measures under the Public Health Act related to capacity limits, physical distancing and masking.</p>
<p>Coates was recently released from jail after 35 days, after he breached a bail condition to stop holding services that did not follow regulations. He pleaded guilty and was fined $1,500.</p>
<p>But the church hasn’t stopped holding services in numbers that health officials have said are over the province’s gathering limit.</p>
<p>On March 28, a spokesperson for Alberta Health Services said the church denied entry to health inspectors, who again noted breaches of COVID-19 rules.</p>
<p>GraceLife’s website says it is to hold another service tomorrow on Easter Sunday.</p>
<p>RCMP, health and justice officials said public-health enforcement is under the discretion of local officers and health inspectors.</p>
<p>AHS said it is considering further enforcement options and hoped to schedule a meeting with GraceLife and its pastor before Easter. However, a church spokeswoman said no meeting was set.</p>
<p>The press secretary for Health Minister Tyler Shandro said it’s a complex situation.</p>
<p>“Generally we defer questions on specific enforcement actions to AHS as we don’t dictate practice in any individual instance,” Steve Buick said in an e-mail.</p>
<p>AHS said there have been no reports of COVID-19 outbreaks at the church and individual cases cannot be disclosed. However, in a video of a July service posted on the church’s YouTube page, a speaker says “we have done in-house contact tracing for those of you who tested positive.”</p>
<p>Claman and Osman say no members of their faith communities have contracted COVID-19 at their synagogue or mosque, because regulations are strictly enforced.</p>
<p>As active members in their communities, Osman and Claman confidently say they haven’t heard of any outbreaks at mosques or synagogues across the province.</p>
<h2>“You’re never going to benefit from breaking regulations,” says Claman. “They’re there to help.”</h2>
<p>So the lines are pretty well set already.  If this ends without an uprising our fate is sealed, accelerated decay and slavery.</p>

        <p>I live in Edmonton.</p>
<p>People are starting to freak out but aren't sure what our options are.</p>
<ul>
<li>Complain on Twitter? Posts deleted or you're smeared as "harassing" politicians. Possibly lose your job since social media is a giant honeypot.</li>
<li>Protest in public? Smeared as a superspreader event and the news links you to white supremacist groups even if it's not even remotely true. If you're a single guy, every girl your age automatically hates you for attending these so congrats on disqualifying yourself from the dating pool.</li>
<li>Violence? lol go straight to jail</li>
</ul>
<p>I think what's terrifying is the volume of unlicensed firearms here. If there's going to be any sort of violent backlash or stories of bullets coming back at officers who start raiding establishments, it's going to be <em>big.</em></p>

        <p>Politicians following the lemmings should be ejected. It's hard to resist loud mobs screaming for action. But by doing what the mob wants mean pissing the rest off.  Sweden is one year behind and on the route to stupid lockdowns. People are fed up and next year, we have election. Our government won't survive if they try lockdowns so close to an election.</p>

        <p>I’m a 25yo girl in Calgary and would be THRILLED to find a guy who opposed lockdowns. Sorry, but virtual dates really creep me tf out and I want to find people who want to do stuff in the real world. Totally fine with gaming and stuff like that- but like, not 24/7. I don’t think I could EVER be in a relationship after this with someone who accepts this stuff as okay. </p>
<p>That being said, I would say girls are a lot worse with this stuff. I’m bisexual and look at girls’ bios on apps and many girls are the ones who are saying that they don’t wanna see anyone without a vaccine, posting vaccine memes in their social media and stuff like that. It’s gonna be a lot harder for straight guys to find “normal” girls than for straight and bi girls to find guys- most of you are normal and you will no doubt be able to find normal girls with a bit of looking!</p>
