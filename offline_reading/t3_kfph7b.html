    <strong>Words matter. Doomers and boot-lickers butchering our language.</strong>
    <p><p>Man is a creature of verbal and written communication. It is one of the main things that separates us from the rest of the animal kingdom, and has enabled us to create civilization as we know it.</p>
<p>When some of us older folk went to school, our teachers were merciless when it came to the correction of style, grammar, punctuation, spelling, etc. They impressed upon us that "poor communication will be misunderstood communication". </p>
<p>Anyone remember the little word-play of "Let's eat, Grandma!" versus "Let's eat Grandma!"? How many people struggle with "lose", "loose", "their", "there", etc?</p>
<p>Our long retired teachers would be shocked at the degradation of our language skills. They would be even more shocked at <em>the deliberate subversion of language to forward certain agendas - which has become particularly open and blatant during the Rona.</em></p>
<p>"Freedumbs": <em>Whoever thought that the word describing "freedom" - something which millions have suffered, sacrificed, and died to achieve, and millions more aspire to - would be framed as an insult?</em></p>
<p>"Populist": <em>A word that used to refer to a politician who actually worked for his constituents, and took their needs and wishes into account when making policy. Like what we supposedly pay these people to do. Now the word means "OMFG literally Hitler!!!!!!!!!!".</em></p>
<p>"Science": <em>Used to mean a process to explain and understand the natural world by creating theories, testing them, proving them to be sound and repeatable. Now means using cherry-picked, falsified, or irrelevant data to "prove" conclusions you have already established, which suit your agenda, or those of your paymasters.</em></p>
<p>"Pandemic": <em>The WHO actually changed the definition of this word. Otherwise the WuFlu wouldn't even qualify. They needed a big, scary word to make the sheeple think of the Black Death - and so it was changed!</em></p>
<p>"Skeptic": <em>Used to mean someone who studied or researched something and did not agree with the orthodox conclusion. A skeptic was considered someone with a valid viewpoint to be debated. Now, a "skeptic" is someone to be mocked, intimidated, and silenced - hence the word's replacement with ones like "conspiracy theorist" or "denier"...</em></p>
<p>"Case": <em>This word used to refer to someone who was proven, through proper testing protocols, to have a disease - and show symptoms of it. Now it means anyone given a "test" with a +50% false positive rate who "tests positive" for WuFlu, despite being completely free of symptoms. The same scam is used with "Covid death".</em></p>
<p>As we all know, the examples of this twisting of language are everywhere. Our opponents are more and more open with their stated intent to cheapen, pervert, and bastardize our written and spoken thoughts, until we don't have them anymore.</p>
<p>Note, though, that other words they love to use - like "comply", "obey", "submit" - are eternal.</p></p>

        <p>As an editor by profession, I couldn’t have said it better myself. As petty as it is, one of my main gripes with this segment of the population (whether you want to call them leftists or sheep or doomers) is their deliberate deconstruction and manipulation of language to achieve their own ends. They’re not just words. </p>
<p>They changed the dictionary definition of racism, gender, and even preference just for political wins. These people have no idea what they’re messing with. You obscure meaning and dismantle communication at your own peril. There’s a reason Orwell was so focused on that idea.</p>

        <p>Totally agree. The grammatical skills of the past couple of generations have been shit. I'm not a grammar policeman but the spelling and grammar of most people my age is embarrassing to read.</p>
<p>Also think this is the effect of all the higher-ups wanting kids to major in STEM and business while bashing the liberal arts. We're all seeing the residue from this kind of thinking. Very few people are capable of original thinking and it's sad. Subjects like history, literature, foreign language and philosophy don't matter anymore. It's all about tech, business and efficiency. This society's gone to shit.</p>

        <p>When you and your opponent can't even agree on the definition of words and their premises, we can not come to an amicable solution, only conflict based on misunderstanding each other. One party will always perceives the other's view of an idea with presumption, like with the arrogance of someone who acts like they can read your mind. That's how we end up with these people who refuse to listen to dissent because they think they know it all because their prophets told them the definitions of our purported plight, that 'freedom' just means freedom to infect, that 'human rights' mean the right to hurt others, and that 'not social distancing' may as well make you akin to an immoral killer. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The soft-headed easily absorb these new, perverted definitions completely forgetting that we do not all view the world same way and attribute malice to basic natural humans needs and behavior. This is why the media, these manipulative presstitute journalists and sell out experts need to go. We can't allow them to manipulate the mid-wits and low IQ people to be their golems against us by attacking the very meaning of everything that was otherwise perceived to be healthy.</p>

        <p>Our opponents have used double-speak for so long that their hijacking of the language is now the NPC's "go-to" version. They have seeded the schools with it from kindergarten up, and it is pervasive in the media.</p>
<p>As we both know, it's super easy to spot if you know - look at words like "tolerance", "social distancing", and "equality". It's a deliberate middle-finger to those of us who still see things for what they actually are.</p>
<p>The concerning part is that the statists, the bullies, and the jack-booters are so confident of victory that they are beginning to <em>actually say what they mean</em> <em>and what they actually want</em> - like throwing us in camps, hunting down our families, getting us thrown out on the street.</p>
<p>They have evolved from the couched terms of "Send them to Madagascar" to openly saying "Send them to Treblinka".</p>

        <p>This has been going on for years. Postmodernism and intersectional ideology has been waging an ongoing war on language in order to muddy the waters, destroy objectivity, and subvert law. When language becomes meaningless, they can assert unfalsifiable statements claiming that anything means anything.</p>

        <p>Oh don't forget their obbsessive use of "pandemic" instead of "the" or "a" pandemic, almost personifying it, like "The resturant is closed because of pandemic" and add "covid time" for bonus points, this is literally how people talk now, "the store is closed because of pandemic during covid time."
