    <strong>This ends when life becomes inconvenient for pro-lockdowners (no Doordash or Prime)</strong>
    <p><p>Most people who support the response to the scamdemic fall into a few categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Awkward young people who live at home and their parents pay for everything who are thrilled because their degenerate lifestyle is normalized and they never wanted to leave their house to begin with.</li>
<li>Upper middle class people who LOVE staying home with their kids and "working from home" (i.e. half-assing everything, not commuting, etc.).</li>
<li>People who love to virtue-signal on social media.</li>
</ul>
<p>What do all of these people have in common? Their lockdown lifestyle is propped up by modern technology and poor people (weird how all these so-called "kind-hearted" people aren't worried about COVID outbreaks in restaurant kitchens and Amazon warehouses).</p>
<p>If anything happened to any one of these services, they would change their tune and America would open up immediately:</p>
<ul>
<li>High-speed internet access</li>
<li>Restaurant and grocery delivery</li>
<li>Fast shipping speeds</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it. If Amazon warehouses went on strike, the restrictions end. If all restaurants refused to deal with Doordash and Ubereats orders (or, more likely, go out of business), this ends. I know it won't happen because the owners of the businesses and the workers are desperate, but man it would be nice if these smug motherfuckers felt an ounce of discomfort for once in their lives.</p>
<p>Not sure what my point is, but I hate these smug motherfuckers who are acting like they're making some huge sacrifice by staying home when that's all they ever wanted to do to begin with. And I HATE the fact that, if they truly believe the virus is deadly, they have no problem making poor people expose themselves to it just to enable their degeneracy.</p></p>

        <p>slow internet access would smoke them out the fastest. you can deal with no restaurant or grocery delivery, but with how spoiled we are with having everything instant, (when's the last time you actually bought a movie or a videogame with a disc) it would end things almost immediately. just having internet problems for half an hour makes me want to go outside and run-it pisses me off that me being able to entertain myself is solely dependent on internet a lot of the time.</p>

        <p>So true. If they want to "sacrifice for the common good" so much, they can live at home 20th century style. Just the tiny "sacrifice" of losing internet access would make these losers' heads explode.</p>
<p>One tiny bit of discomfort is all it would take. They are THAT spoiled.</p>

We will see anyway because the way things are cannot continue for that much longer. They people who are comfortable will start to suffer too and maybe then we will stand more united against bullshit.</p>

        <p>Yep, I'm thinking the upcoming hyperinflation will make life difficult for some of these people. The inflation in the stock market is a leading indicator of what's coming for consumer goods.</p>

        <p>Sure. There is a huge surge in the M1 money supply this year due to the "stimulus" (which mainly went to rich people). M1 refers to bank deposits and physical currency.</p>
<p><a href="https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2021/01/whats-behind-the-recent-surge-in-the-m1-money-supply/">https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2021/01/whats-behind-the-recent-surge-in-the-m1-money-supply/</a></p>
<p>Since the majority of the money is going to the rich, and there are only so many consumer goods they can buy, they're putting it into the stock market. Some poorer people are also putting their stimulus checks into the stock market as well, which is having an effect (Robinhood effect).</p>
<p>The increase in the money supply is similar to what happened in the Weimar Republic, one of the worst episodes of hyperinflation in history.</p>
<p>Similar to Weimar Republic days, the US dollar will eventually lose its value relative to foreign currencies if nothing changes for the better (highly unlikely). This devaluation of the dollar will lead to an increase in prices for everything.</p>
<p>Here's a quote from Wikipedia about hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_the_Weimar_Republic">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_the_Weimar_Republic</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"the resulting increase in the supply of German marks on the market caused the German mark to fall rapidly in value, which greatly increased the number of marks needed to buy more foreign currency.</p>
<p>That caused German prices of goods to rise rapidly, increasing the cost of operating the German government, which could not be financed by raising taxes because those taxes would be payable in the ever-falling German currency. The resulting deficit was financed by some combination of issuing bonds and simply creating more money, both increasing the supply of German mark-denominated financial assets on the market and so further reducing the currency's price. When the German people realized that their money was rapidly losing value, they tried to spend it quickly. That increased monetary velocity caused an ever-faster increase in prices, creating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicious_cycle">vicious cycle</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_the_Weimar_Republic#cite_note-33">[33]</a></p>
<p>The government and the banks had two unacceptable alternatives. If they stopped inflation, there would be immediate bankruptcies, unemployment, strikes, hunger, violence, collapse of civil order, insurrection and possibly even revolution.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_the_Weimar_Republic#cite_note-Fergusson_p._254-34">[34]</a> If they continued the inflation, they would default on their foreign debt."</p>
<p>However, attempting to avoid both unemployment and insolvency ultimately failed when Germany had both.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_the_Weimar_Republic#cite_note-Fergusson_p._254-34">[34]</a></p>

<p>Amen and Awoman.   It just seems to slide right on by them that their lifestyle is fully dependent on those who can't afford it.   I think some comfort themselves because they also support a $15 minimum wage, so that makes them the good guys to the worker bees.</p>

<p>Sounds like a lot of people I know lol.</p>
<p>But yeah, I completley agree. If I talk to anyone who actually, u know, has a job and/or responsibilities in life, they're of the same opinion as us here; but when I talk to people my age (let's say 18-24), most of whom still live with their parents, are at uni (college), or can sit on furlough (where the govt will pay them 80% of their wage for sitting at home and doing nothing, basically UBI), they all spew the same sanctimonious bullshit thinking they're saving the world by ordering uber eats meals and not leacing their house for years, with the exceptions of a few. As soon as furlough ends (hopefully), and as soon as those at uni need to get a job, I'm sure their views will change very quickly indeed.</p>

        <p>My partner is a software architect and works hard because he loves it. I am a freelance software developer and I work hard because I don’t get paid if I don’t. </p>
<p>I am locked down with my four favourite people. We cook all meals from scratch at home (we did so before the pandemic). We hike, kayak, make art, read, play games, improve our home. </p>
<p>I buy groceries, beer, books, games, art supplies, etc., all local mom &amp; pop businesses we support steadily. </p>
<p>When I wanted to order on Amazon pre-Christmas, I tipped the delivery guys $20 a pop. </p>
<p>I miss going to shows, concerts, hanging with friends, going on impromptu road trips, showing my kids the world around us. But I can handle delayed gratification. </p>
<p>If you want to take away my internet, go ahead. Have you guys never heard of books? A deck of cards? Cooking a nice meal and talking? </p>
<p>Also, no social media except for Reddit, and talking to friends and family on slack or zoom. But I write letters too - do you know what those are?</p>
