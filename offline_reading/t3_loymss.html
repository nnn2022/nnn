    <p><p>I'm from India, and in my state, public schools have mostly all reopened, several private schools will reopen at the start of the new session in March. I am interested to hear perspectives from all sides of the globe.</p>
<p>My only regret is we have to follow a crap ton of regulations even though teenagers have a basically zero chance of anything serious happening.</p></p>

        <p>Greece: universities have been closed for 2 semesters, 3rd is coming and they are scheduled not to reopen. Long distance learning has been used but no labs/clinical training has been active whatsoever for the whole period. Elementary, middle and high schools have mostly reopened recently after having been closed since last march (with a small reopening break in may-june) but masks are required  for both students at techers at all times. So generally things are pretty horrible.</p>
