    <strong>Covid &amp; personal freedom</strong>
    <p><p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>Found this sub because I’ve been frustrated by the hypocrisy of Covid hyper-conscious people. However, I am not a Covid denier- I trust vaccines and the statistics and science shown by the government/media. I simply believe liberals are interpreting the science wrong.</p>
<p>I believe that freedom means being able to do whatever you want that does not directly, measurably hurt someone else or interfere with their ability to do likewise. I also believe that businesses are not people and can/should be regulated differently.</p>
<p>I think that Covid rules should follow the principle of freedom, in that people should be able to do whatever they want that does not restrict others freedom. Personally I believe mask mandates are good in certain public places, and limits on gatherings are necessary when hospitals are overwhelmed. I think that in places and times where Covid was overwhelming hospitals, holding Covid-unsafe gatherings IS an infringement on others freedom. When hospitals are overwhelmed, spreading Covid causes death to people who otherwise would not have died.
Likewise, I believe not wearing a mask in certain public places is also infringing on others ability to be safe. Everyone has to go get groceries, so I believe stores that are “essential” should be subject to mask mandates.</p>
<p>However, past those two restrictions I believe more Covid restrictions are unacceptable limits to freedom. Nobody is forcing you to go to large gatherings on private property- if you chose to do so it is your fault if you get Covid, and it’s also not anyone else’s business, unless you are contributing to overloading hospitals or shoving your maskless face at people who did not chose to be around you. (Anyone else who hasn’t been in contact with you)</p>
<p>Now that vaccines are available and most elderly or at risk people have gotten them (at least in my state), I believe we should go back to somewhat normal, and those who still do not wish to get it but are not at risk can continue to isolate until they are vaccinated. My actions are not going to kill anyone now that people at risk are vaccinated, and with the exception of when hospitals are overloaded my actions were never going to kill anyone who took responsibility for their risk and followed guidelines.</p>
<p>Once Covid death/hospitalization rates fall, I believe ANY remaining Covid restrictions will be unnecessary restrictions of freedom. We all accept many risks when we leave our house, and once Covid is no longer deadly as the at risk are vaccinated then it will just be that. Ya I know there’s a slim chance you can still get it vaccinated but we all accept slim risks of car accidents etc every time we leave the house. Even now I’d say Covid barely counts as deadly. Once it reaches what would be normal flu death rates we should just go back to normal.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p></p>

        <p>Exactly the question we as a society should be answering! </p>
<p>I think when it is similar to what flu is. Can’t find what a typical flu strain fatality rate is but:
https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20201218/covid-19-is-far-more-lethal-damaging-than-flu-data-shows</p>
<p>This source said for hospitalized patients, rate of death (in hospitalized patients) for flu is 5% and Covid is 18%. So once those numbers become more similar. We’ve already accepted flu deaths as an acceptable risk as a society, so once Covid is similar we should go back to normal. For now we still need restrictions in public places until Covid is similar. </p>
<p>That article was from awhile ago, as we understand Covid better hospital deaths have dropped to less than 5% in some places:
