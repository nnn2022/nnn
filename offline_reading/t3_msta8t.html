    <strong>Surveys: COVID-19 Perceptions and Role-Play [Repost]</strong>
    <p><p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I'm hoping I could get your help with two distinct studies, both short; altogether, this should take you less than 10 minutes.</p>
<p>First, as a favor to our funding university, you will complete a short 2-minute survey about your perceptions of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a second study, you will complete a role-play exercise about a social group meeting up during the pandemic. Anyone living in the United States who is at least 18 years old and has an understanding of the English language can participate in these studies.</p>
<p>Study Link: <a href="https://wcu.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3adFtRLZuttNEvY">https://wcu.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3adFtRLZuttNEvY</a></p>
<p>Disclaimer (ethical/legal): This research was reviewed by an Institutional Review Board, and it was determined to be exempt from IRB oversight.</p>
<p>Your help is GREATLY appreciated! Feel free to comment with any questions or concerns you may have after you take the surveys and I'll be around to respond as much as possible. Thanks!</p>

<p>(P.S. I saw this subreddit had a flair for Academic Research and no explicit rules against posting surveys, but that flair wasn't available to me when I wrote this post so I used the next best option. Related, I see there is a rule about reposts that mentions a "long enough period has passed"; the tradition for social media research is to post every 24-48 hours to maximize reach [e.g. not only hear the input of people viewing Reddit at 12:00 on a particular Monday], and at the time I'm posting this it has been 4-5 days. If I'm breaking any unspoken subreddit rules by posting this, or misinterpreting the repost rule, certainly feel free to delete this post)</p></p>
