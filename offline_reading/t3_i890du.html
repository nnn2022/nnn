    <strong>Imagine being a 5 year old today</strong>
    <p><p>This is about when people have their earliest memories.    You are being taught to fear other people because they spread disease and can get you sick.  You are also taught that you can spread disease and must stay away from others so you don't infect them.   You don't see other people's faces and their expressions.  You see masked, anonymous strangers.    You can't play with your friends.  In fact, you may not have any because you aren't allowed to interact with other kids.   You certainly can't go to school because other children and teachers must be avoided.</p>
<p>Is this how we want today's children to grow up?   What happens when they become teenagers?</p></p>

        <p>not to mention parents....which really NEED to go back to work, if you have a small child you can't just put them in front of a computer and expect them to learn like MAGIC... you will need to stay at home and become a teacher for a year.</p>
<p>Thats what I did during lock down, i became an unpaid elem teacher...while her real teacher collected a check and did a google meeting for 10 mins a week... TO MAKE SURE SHE WAS LEARNING WHAT I WAS TEACHING HER....</p>
<p>YES TEACHER HOW AM I DOING?!</p>
<p>turns out A BETTER JOB THEN THE REAL TEACHER.</p>
<p>pssshhhh if they dragged this out homeschool was now a real option,  she was learning at the speed of light with me... i've already got her into her next grade level math and reading... when she goes back to school it will be a cake walk.</p>

        <p>Interesting story. It truly mystifies me sometimes how glacial the pace of instruction in schools is. Admittedly they do have problems with the worst-behaved and slowest students, but I think most people would be shocked at how fast even an average student can progress through the K-12 curriculum compared to the standard length of time.</p>

        <p>oh it will get better for sure, they auto passed everyone into the next grade... so kids didn't even have to complete the lock down work. I made sure to do school every single day and get it right.  Im sure lots of kids and crappy parents just said EARLY SUMMER, and skated.</p>
<p>Now they will go back to school and be brain dead.</p>
<p>2021 the year everyone fails.</p>
<p>not to mention the kids that don't even go back to real school for a whole year... they'll be behind 3+ years now.</p>
<p>graduation class of 21 year olds.</p>
<p>this is a disaster, im just making sure mine doesn't get caught up in it.</p>

        <p>Schools are actually a horrible social environment for young children compared to being at home and out and about with their parents and freely playing both on their own and with other kids in the real world, socializing all the while. The trouble is that that's not what we are currently offering young children.</p>
<p>Being in a virtual simulacrum of life in solitary confinement is also a horrible environment, but at this point even if they did reopen the schools they would be under so many restrictions it would be less disturbing to the children to just keep them closed and let the children keep their memories. Now, many schools are already ignoring the restrictions in practice, but much the same is also being done outside of school.</p>
<p>In short, what is damaging children's social development is "lockdown" and "the new normal", not closing schools.</p>

        <p>I agree. If young children were able to socialize with their peers than it wouldn’t be as detrimental. I don’t always think that schools are the best environment for kids but I’m not sure all parents are qualified to home school. Although if you’ve ever spent some time in an underfunded urban school the bar is pretty damn low.</p>

        <p>My 2 year old goes to a place called Romp-n-Roll where kids play on big cushy obstacles.  She had been going routinely as soon as they reopened in May to get some exercise and play with other kids.  </p>
<p>Then a few weeks ago they implemented a new policy that all kids 2 and up must wear a mask from the front door to the play area whereupon they could remove the mask. My wife said "This is ridiculous! I'm not putting a mask on my baby, and besides you're letting her take it off as soon as she enters the play area!"</p>
<p>Their response was "Well we just want the little ones to get used to wearing a mask." </p>
<p>WHY!??! Why would a two year old need to get used to wearing a mask? These people want the masks to stay forever, that's why. It's sick.</p>

        <p>They do.  They want the masks forever.  That’s why I’m not doing it.  Not wearing a mask at all.  I’m not arguing either.  I ignore the mask signs because most places don’t care.  They just put up the sign because government.  If a business actually won’t let me, then I’ll go elsewhere. Simple as that.  And when we don’t wear masks, it gives other people the courage to not wear them.  Several times I have noticed masked people see me without a mask and take theirs off like “if he’s not wearing this stupid then I’m not either.”   I love seeing that happen.</p>

        <p>No child should ever have to get used to wearing a mask. My toddler has never and will never wear a mask. I don't make my step-daughter wear a mask when she's at our house but unfortunately, her mom is pro-mask so I can't control that.</p>

        <p>That does give the real game away, doesn't it? It is disturbing they are trying to normalize this through people's children, and without being honest about it with the parents until pressed on it. You should definitely arrange your own exercise and play group if feasible.</p>

        <p>Oh believe me we told them then and there that we were done with them. My wife even asked that they refund our membership because you pay something like $30/month to be able to come in any time during one of the sessions. No dice on the refund, but we emailed management and expressed our disgust at their new policy.</p>

        <p>Oh yeah. I said this when they first started closing schools. This isn't going to be for a little while either. There's no talking down the insane doomers and there's no taking back the unchecked absolute powers governors and local officials have granted themselves. This doesn't end even with a vaccine. Idk what ends this that isn't going to be an actual honest to god fight to get our country and freedoms back. </p>
<p>But all these kids growing up right now. 5 -18.  We've fucked them mentally and emotionally for a generation. An entire generation will feel the results of this the rest of their lives. Graduations and experiences robbed from not just last year's class but you know 2021's and probably 2022's as well. They'll go into college but not because it's all online. No sports. No making new friends. The young ones will grow up in fear of everything due to irrational insane parents. No friends, no parties, no school. It's absolutely horrible.</p>

        <p>I saw some study that said 1/3 of men 25 and under haven't had sex in the last year.  I have a feeling that number is gonna skyrocket as we raise kids teaching them to avoid socialization and fear other people.  Plus it's hard to get laid when you went to college online and still live with your parents because you can't find a job.</p>

        <p>And don't get me wrong, I feel like it's very incel-like to say it's women's fault for being so sexually promiscuous.  We just have a very fucked up dating market at the moment, and any man who expresses frustration over the situation gets shamed, mocked, and branded an incel.</p>

        <p>Take a look at the men under 25 and tell me they don't make up a significant proportion of that one-third.  See a few generations ago it was expected that a young man have a job, keep himself active, socialize regularly, have actual constructive hobbies and passions, and dress decent and groom himself like he wants to look presentable. Most young men also had some sort of military combat experience to grow them a set of nuts. Today young men are scrawny hunchbacked dweebs and fat slobs with cheeto crumbs in their scraggly neckbeards and their guts hanging out their Rick and Morty t-shirt. They think videogames is a personality and live with their mothers indefinitely. A generation of beta males. It's no wonder women pass around the same few males. The rest are shit.</p>

        <p>The increase wasn't a gradual one over the last 60 years.  It was a sudden one in the last decade.  Coincidentally when online dating gained popularity.</p>
<p>The "living with your mother indefinitely" part is a double-whammy.  Housing costs keep increasing while wages don't, and the stigma regarding living with your parents keeps getting worse and worse.</p>

        <p>&rt;housing costs</p>
<p>Either it's a priority to be independent or it isn't. There is plenty of affordable housing it's just not the same standard as your cushy middle-class childhood. Your first apartment isn't supposed to have a gaming room, or a pool, or a walk-in closet, or any of that crap. I have a friend who keeps using this line, he's 32 and keeps claiming apartments are too expensive. I go to his parents place when he "has the house to himself" I think yeah no shit you think moving out is expensive we're sitting on nice leather sofas looking out a huge window onto a manicured backyard sticking our empty beer cans on a marble countertop your expectations are out of whack.</p>

        <p>I think the idea that moving out = independence is a load of bullshit that holds young people back and forces them into bad financial decisions.  In addition I think the idea that being "independent" when you are borderline bankrupt is also bullshit.  I live with my parents right now at 25, and am closing on my first house in a month.  Yeah it sucks and yeah I have no real privacy or easy means of socializing with the boys.  But I don't think living in a studio apartment would have done much for me aside from let me have a little bit more meaningless sex while setting my financial goals way behind.  If I had gone with shared housing, it would have been cheap, but would have offered no more privacy than living with my parents.  </p>
<p>So anyway, I lived with my parents for a few years, piled away money, and now I have a nice headstart to retirement along with the means to comfortably buy an actual house at 25.  If I play my cards right, I'll have enough money in my 30s to go on a sabbatical and live off rental income and saved money while all the people I know that are currently "independent" will be two paychecks away from bankruptcy.  If that's your idea of independent, be my guest.</p>
<p>I've spent the last 3 years being told I'm not independent because I live with my parents.  It made dating and socializing suck ass, but the real thing that made those suck ass is the fact that there's such a stigma associated with living with your parents for financial reasons.  Living with my parents made dating and socializing a bit more difficult, but the arbitrary stigma associated with it, that was the real barrier.</p>

        <p>Every man I know who moved out of their parents' house before the age of 22 - especially into a dorm or apartment with male roommates - is a reckless, irresponsible, belligerent party-goer who huffs their own farts, is addicted to alcohol or other hard drugs, and can often be found in jail or the hospital. Same with men who don't move out until 28 or older. From what I've seen, 23-27 seems to be the sweet spot for leaving the nest.</p>

        <p>The stigma is there for a reason. Living with one's parents having them pay your costs is something children do, because they are not yet mentally capable of running their own household. A grownup makes their own way through life. Sometimes it's hard but that's how the world goes. Children get taken care of. Adults take care of themselves.</p>
<p>Are you also so socially clueless you can't see why a woman wouldn't want to meet someone's parents when they've only known him for a few days? Meeting family is a pretty big step in a relationship, it signifies it's serious and exclusive, that happens long after you figure out if the two of you are even sexually compatible. How does it play out in your mind, you meet a nice young woman, you hit it off, go on a date, bring her back to your place, and your mother is supposed to ignore the fact there's a complete stranger in her home? Does Mother pretend not to hear sex noises? Is she supposed to hole herself up in the bedroom the whole evening so she doesn't bump into this strange woman when she goes to the bathroom down the hall? Is your date not going to go in the kitchen and have a snack, hang out and chat with you on the couch in the living room and make herself comfortable? If you're dating multiple people to see who's a good match or just want to fuck around instead of looking for something long-term are your parents supposed to just put up with a rotating cast of dozens of strangers coming and going through their house at odd hours?</p>
<p>If you're old enough to date you're old enough to do the bare minimum of providing for yourself economically. Nothing fancy, just a roof over your head protected by a legal contract. I've met loads of people who claim to be saving money by living with their parents who all have an adolescent mentality towards money. They don't know what things cost, they work casually if at all, they blow money on bullshit, or they have some unrealistic goals that don't line up with the numbers. Can't afford to move out but they have the gaming rig and the collections of merch and the fart cannon car mods and all the other toys that teenagers spend money on when they get their first few paycheques. If they're not literal virgins they have relationships that are constant drama and sneaking around to have privacy and a convoluted web of availabilities based around whose parents need them where at what time, why would anyone want that, just pay rent on a small apartment instead of blowing your paycheque on Yeezy's or whatever.</p>
<p>If you're telling the truth and you actually did get a grownup job and saved enough to buy your own property at 25 while living with Mum and Dad that's fantastic, good job for you, but for the majority of people living with their parents in their 20s that's not the case and you can't fault women for assuming you're one of them because at 25 you still live with Mum and Dad doing the same routine as when you were 16 with work in place of school as the place you go to in the morning. Sorry but that's an adolescent lifestyle and a grown woman is not going to put up with that.</p>

        <p>I was shocked when schools started closing. My county initially fought to keep schools open but they caved under the pressure of people demanding that schools be closed. Schools were supposed to reopen in 2 weeks and then it was pushed to mid-May and then people just threw up their hands and cancelled the entire rest of the school year. And people were okay with that. We should have opened schools in some capacity back in mid-May. And now we are dealing with everyone hysterical over this virus and teachers fighting to teach online for the next year. It is pathetic.</p>

        <p>It makes me so angry that the pro-mask brigade are so oblivious to this. You are right to fear for the children, and I fear for the younger children too. When my daughter was a baby and toddler, I remember when we went shopping, or out on the street people, would smile at her. Learning to recognise faces, and to pick up on the emotional content of non-verbal communication is a really important part of a child's development which will be severely limited if this farce carries on.</p>

        <p>my god, yes - this! my husband and i have been taking lots of long walks around our quiet suburban neighborhood on house arrest, and we both always go out of our way to say hello to the kids and give them a big smile. it's important for children to learn how to interact with adults, it's so key for their socialization. my husband sometimes makes a silly face or makes a funny sound or offers a high five - kids used to love it! getting a laugh or smile or a small surprised hello was so lovely. </p>
<p>now, they shirk away and don't know how to smile or respond or laugh, and it's heartbreaking. they shake their sweet little heads like they don't understand why a grown up would say hello to them. sometimes their parents flinch away or act like we're terrible monsters - you know, those people who will see you coming and immediately haul across to the other side of the street. entire families in masks, some with gloves. i always thought it was nice and polite and kind to say hi to your neighbors, to offer a kind word to strangers. well, apparently i am some sort of devil woman and husband is literally the worst. "HOW DARE YOU SAY HI TO MY CHILD YOU LITERAL GRANDMA KILLER YOU."</p>
<p>what in god's name are we doing to the children in the name of saving one life? we're scarring them for life, i fear for their brains, for their growth and development, for their socialization and linguistics, everything. teaching them that for simply daring to exist, that kids can/will kill their grandparents and teachers and bus drivers. can you imagine the sense of shame and guilt and disappointment and fear with which the children are being imbued? jfc. teaching kids that humans are no more than vectors of disease gets very dark, very fast.</p>

        <p>Had a guy steer a stroller straight into a small retaining wall and awkwardly drag it up the 18" stones to avoid me on a sidewalk back in May. What must that poor toddler think of the world by now?</p>

        <p>seriously! good freaking lord! that poor little angel is going to need serious therapy and help in a few years. whenever i see a parent act like that, it makes me wonder what they're saying to their children at home about this, about other people, about behavior. it's like extreme agoraphobia or germaphobia, but on a global scale. what will it take to re-integrate these people into society? what if we've already lost an entire generation of children?</p>
<p>it's not just social skills - it's basic human cooperation. if you aren't even willing to walk past someone on the sidewalk, how in the hell are you going to function in the real world? humans can't survive unless we band together as a society - we've already to tried to survive as lone wolves. that didn't work out - as it happens, the wolves <em>literally</em> ate us. so we gave up on that 6-10,000 years ago and decided to settle down and figure it out.</p>
<p>the doomers sure like to make jokes about natural selection and Charles Darwin, but jesus christ, they're the ones who are about to breed themselves out of existence. well, in their case, not breed. it is survival of the fittest, and they're all just holing up inside their caves and hiding from the real world. either they cash their reality check and get with the program, or they're about to be left behind and out of the future gene pool entirely.</p>
<p>i remind myself that in the future, when i have kids, i'll need to be extra understanding and kind to their little friends who might have nutjob parents at home. this whole thing has honestly made me want to be a better person and role model for children. be the light and joy you want to see in the world - you never know who is going to need to see it.</p>

        <p>&rt; now, they shirk away and don't know how to smile or respond or laugh, and it's heartbreaking. they shake their sweet little heads like they don't understand why a grown up would say hello to them. sometimes their parents flinch away or act like we're terrible monsters - you know, those people who will see you coming and immediately haul across to the other side of the street.</p>
<p>I think it was like this even before COVID and masks were a thing. Trust me, as an adult with "childish" interests, I've received that sort of treatment from parents for many years. There were lots of parents who taught their kids to distrust any adults who were not them. However, I think it's gotten much worse. Much worse. Now these parents are teaching their kids to distrust <strong>everyone</strong> because they might get them sick, and possibly die.</p>

        <p>Yes, viewing everyone you meet as a threatening disease vector instead of a potential partner to advance shared goals is perhaps the worst effect of the fearmongering during this crisis. Not that there isn't truth to both views of course, but the general view has shifted far too much in the direction of disease vector than is actually beneficial.</p>

<p>Gonna get downvoted and insulted for this, but it depends. Some parents use homeschooling as their own indoctrination as well, to instill the values they want in their kids, and maintain control over them, as such abuse tends to follow as well. So there's parents out there with ill-intent as well, and weaponize homeschooling the way the government is doing right now with the "pandemic".</p>

        <p>Parenting comes with de facto indoctrination. Public school is fine when the message matches what’s at home, or at least is very minimal. My SO is in public education, so I’ve been more sympathetic to it till this year; the push for actual, concerted indoctrination with certain views is real and getting more aggressive now. </p>
<p>Anyway. I suppose it’s a world of pick your poison, and fwiw, I’m glad I still have the option to remove my kids from public school if I have to and not go bankrupt paying for private school. Granted, I’ll probably get forced into that decision over mandatory vaccination, not ideological warfare.</p>

        <p>The point I'm trying to make is that homeschooling isn't always perfect, and kids with bad parents can still get damaged from it. Not saying homeschooling is always bad, but...there's just bad people out there who abuse any and all ways of doing things, like with education.</p>

Well, we used to have extra-cirricular classes and sports, scouts, gymnastics, etc...all of which now require a mask or don't exist here anymore.

        <p>Have a 5 year old. We have been striving to keep everything normal. We joke about the overblown coronavirus and tell her that some people are just big wimpy scaredy-cats. She plays with friends, luckily we can go to enough places where masks aren’t being worn. She is “supposed” to wear one in school when it starts but she’s going with one of those neck gaiter things and is being told she can take it off whenever she wants and that the teachers can not force her to put it on. She won’t get in trouble at home. I’m prepared to fight that battle with teachers and administration.</p>

        <p>This! I’m doing the exact same thing. I have a 5, 3, and 1 year old. Luckily my kids are going to a smaller religious private preschool so I hope they won’t be as crazy with the rules. But I already told me husband that is they are forced to cover their face all day I’m taking them out of school. We have tried to keep everything as normal as possible for the kids. Luckily we are surrounded with a large group of friends that think the same thing we do and they have been able to have a fairly normal summer. Even going on vacation. I’m hopeful that at least in Florida we may hear back to normalcy a bit sooner. DeSantis doesn’t seem to be buying into the chaos as much.</p>

We have been in a steady decline then the last 2 days it had done a very small uptick. I hope that’s not because school is about to start and someone is making it political. I just hope when school hit the 5% threshold that DeSantis stands up to all the fear mongering and lets Florida move on with their lives. Even though in most of Florida there isn’t much sign of a pandemic except bars being closed and the masks.</p>

        <p>It makes me so mad to see kids wearing masks. The 7 year old boy I babysit told me he had to wear a mask to go to some school thing and he didn't understand why and hated it.</p>

        <p>And they’ll lay the responsibility for coddling these kids as they grow into teenagers and adulthood at the feet of well-adjusted people and we will be blamed for their lack of socialization and told it’s our responsibility to make sure they’re hand held through jobs and life.

        <p>I have plenty of memories from much earlier than that, but at age 5 school was THE BEST thing that had ever happened to me. I loved it so much, I didn't even want to take school holidays. No problems at home - I just really really enjoyed learning new things. The fact that school is now considered non-essential is mind-boggling. My 5-year-old self would have been crushed to find out that school was cancelled.</p>

        <p>Great point. </p>
<p>I'm 50.  Growing up in a rural area (as well as genetics I guess) has made me somewhat introverted. 
Except for the occasional concert (which are all cancelled now) I naturally avoid social events. My girlfriend and two dogs are plenty of company for me. </p>
<p>When I am in public, particularly stores, I've always enjoyed smiling at people when I pass them by or make eye contact with them - especially kids. I do it just to get a smile in return. Spreading positivity and all that...</p>
<p>Sadly, that's all gone now for the most part. Having a very "dull" social life, people sometimes ask me why I "don't like people". I'm always quick to correct them and explain that I absolutely love and adore other people and honor each one of them as an immortal soul (namaste!)</p>
<p>The problem I have is when these individual souls give up their personal thoughts, identity and sovereignty by joining "society", then they're just a part of a giant, irrational CULT. The CoronaVirus doomers are the most recent manifestation of this. I fear humanity is headed in a very bad direction.</p>

        <p>I have protected my child from all of this, school just got out early...we did online school.. played with friends just like normal...went about our days as if nothing ever happened. I didn't allow anyone with a mask around, I will not take her to a store that requires a mask.  To her this is just some long summer vacation with some homework.  Thank god she can return to school without some MASK RULE.. yea teachers, kids are going to learn just fine when they all think they are INFECTEDDDDDD.</p>

<p>The worst part is children adapt more easily than adults, they likely won’t have a problem with most of this it’ll just be normal to them.</p>

        <p>I have a 5yo. She has had four and a half years of normal human contact, and she has two siblings so she has plenty of interaction with two adults and two children every day. But I am also not a doomer, and I don’t have my kids wear masks in open spaces and they take them off as soon as they can. </p>
<p>The ones who are really going to be messed up are only-children between the age of 2-4 of woke doomer parents. These kids probably haven’t left their homes in months, haven’t seen a human without a mask on besides their parents, and are being filled with fearful and aggressive rhetoric regarding masks, social distancing, and those who flout the rules. These kids are in a part of their development that can go on to shape how they view the world for a long time, and it’s possible that these children are being groomed to be the fascist/communist shock troops of the next generation, or perpetually scared hypochondriacs. </p>
<p>Luckily, children are very resilient and lets hope that most of these kids come out normal by the time they’re adults, or at least they might remember how stupid their parents were and choose to live differently.</p>

        <p>I have a five year old and an almost 3 year old. We are trying to keep things as normal as possible for them and not living in fear. They both still do gymnastics and are starting soccer this fall. Oldest is starting kindergarten and I'm definitely sad that her experience will not be what it should, given a hybrid schedule and distancing/mask requirements. But at least she'll be able to learn and be around other kids.</p>
<p>I do worry about them not seeing people's faces. We were at the store yesterday and a toddler was looking at me so I smiled, but of course with the mask they didn't see. It's sad. This generation is going to be messed up.</p>
