    <strong>Covid policy broke me as a Democratic voter…</strong>
    <p><p>At this point I’m starting to believe conservative minded citizens might be the only thing saving America. Which is fucking bonkers I would have never believed this not that long ago.</p>
<p>How many of you all just 6 years ago still considered yourselves fairly liberal, probably voting democrat, generally over conservatives and their moral policing and prejudices etc…?</p>
<p>I was like that. Things started falling apart with the radicalization of identity politics. I really found the “American Left” hard to stomach up until 2019 but I was holding on.</p>
<p>Covid just obliterated any connection I had left. I don’t think I’ll ever fuck with Democrats again for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>To be fair though I’m not down with republicans either under normal circumstances, but if I can vote in someone with DeSantis philosophy on covid I’m doing it. This shit is too important.</p></p>

        <p>Yes. I voted Democratic up through Obama's first term but 3rd Party after that.</p>
<p>I will never vote Democrat again. I see them as actual traitors, like... Like they are part of a global coup.</p>
<p>I don't trust the Republican party but I will vote for whatever anti-lockdown pro-vaccine-choice candidates that are most likely to be elected... Because things are so bad.</p>
<p>Probably a Republican straight ticket TBH.</p>

        <p>I too am exiled from the Democratic Party for not supporting their participation in a global coup. Call it what it is, I agree with you. </p>
<p>That said, I’m not going to just jump to the other side. Republicans are still crooked, corrupt bozos but a few of them are actually making reasonable arguments so I’ll support those few. Additionally, I’ll continue to pay attention to any and all public speakers - first sign of someone actually promoting liberty and denouncing the absolutely authoritarian path that the establishment is walking will have my support. I care not how they describe their politics.</p>

        <p>&rt; their participation in a global coup</p>
<p>it was all planned.  the "great reset" was previously labeled by leftist media as a conspiracy theory... now they're bragging about it being a necessity for our species' survival.  seriously, their tag line is "you'll own nothing and you'll be happy."</p>
<p>right now, they're issuing QE to hedge funds, which are then using our own taxpayer dollars to buy up houses.  they turn around and rent them right back to us.  meanwhile the bogus eviction moratorium is being used to shakeout all individual property owners, which forces foreclosure so the hedge funds can buy all the property up at short sale.  within a decade, a handful of hedge funds will own the majority of residential real estate in the US.</p>

        <p>Hey, good for you, plenty of people have lost way more than that and haven't even finished the denial phase. I unfortunately was inducted into the cult literally the day the January momentum finally stopped and it started that slump to $40, luckily I woke up during that second spike and managed to make $800 off a month's rent I gambled. Very, very grateful I managed to learn the "don't gamble with rent money" lesson and somehow managed to make money learning it</p>

<p>Trust me most republicans can't stand the GOP either. The typical complaint you get from Republicans against the GOP is that they're too liberal and too willing to let the democrats take lead. The GOP solicits our votes and then most of them do nothing with the power given to them; a good chunk use their power against their voter's wishes.</p>

        <p>Except the dem voters and the dem politicians broadly agree on things. Take being anti-voucher. The dems are anti-voucher, but the only voter group that is actually anti-voucher when surveyed are white liberals, which still constitute the bulk of the party. Only amongst the non-white liberals are vouchers not supported. As a whole though, most democrats do not support vouchers (although that is changing as white liberals fade as a political group).</p>
<p>Now consider the republicans, despite most republicans supporting vouchers by a lot, most republican politicians are simply unable to do anything about it. When they do institute programs, they're limited and come with strings.</p>
<p>Or abortion politics. GOP politicians string along conservative voters with abortion, but they don't even pay it lip service once in office. At the national level, it is shocking that Trump was the first president to appear in person at the national walk for life. It's not even about law making, it's just about putting forth a particular set of values. Republican politicians have no interest, while democratic ones are happy to show up at pride marches, etc.</p>
<p>I don't see the parties here as similar at all. Republican politicians hold their voters with disdain, while the dems do not. The democrats do what their voters want, no matter how stupid.</p>

        <p>I’ve always been a Republican and I hate most of them except a handful of exceptions. I think it’s the nature of politics that most of them become corrupt and dishonest. It’s the underlying problem of government - bad incentives.</p>

        <p>Working class people. Poor people. People that are overpopulating the planet. It’s hard to control an ever-expanding population. At a certain point, they’re going to be almost impossible to maintain. It’s easier if there is a central, powerful agency combined of elites from the more wealthy nations that agree on one thing: resource production for wealth generation and minimizing the variables necessary for maintaining the working class by removing certain aspects of free society.</p>

        <p>Working class people that elected officials that have been summarily bought out by corporate elites and academic stooges. You’re another one of those bots that are focused on breaking down the language. Break down the language that is used and you fracture any movement behind the idea that the language represents. </p>
<p>Someone could say: factory farming is harming the environment, animals, and free markets. A buncha people upvote and comment on that in support, to the point that it starts to gain traction. And then you bots show up and begin deconstructing the language as a means of division. Bots will say: well, what do you mean by factory farming? There are lots of different kinds of farming. Are you talking about Monsanto? Are you talking about chicken farms or beef farms? What do you mean by “harmful to free markets”? Do you know what a free market is or how free it is? </p>
<p>And then all those people that were supporting an idea - one that they found to be worthy of their attention - are now arguing about individual pieces of the idea that will never actually make a difference. People are too worried about being precisely right or wrong, rather than focusing on uniting behind a general idea of “this is bullshit and this is how many of us agree to some extent that it’s bullshit”.</p>

        <p>He's been strong against Fauci, and has publicly opposed various aspects of the Covid-19 agenda... And I like his dad.</p>
<p>I would vote for him.</p>
<p>I will vote for any Republican that has basic moderate policies. What I expect from a mainstream politician is they can recommend a vaccine but no force. No coercion, and they must protect those of us who say no from coordinated coercion.</p>
<p>Currently our government is colluding with business to sidestep having to legally mandate the vaccine. It is a vicious manipulation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile it's becoming more and more clear that people who get vaccinated get sicker than those who don't. That's why they're aggressively trying to eliminate (vaccinate) the control group.</p>
<p>We need to resist, even if life is uncomfortable for us. We are proof that the vaccines are bad, when we stay healthy and everyone else gets sick.</p>
<p>I also suspect spike proteins in the vaccinated will lead to prion disease in a large percentage of those who take it, and it will be misdiagnosed as alzheimers. Watch for it...</p>
<p>My family and I will live in a van if it comes to that.</p>
<p>This isn't forever. The side effects will emerge. We just have to weather the peak of the storm. There will be passports. We may need to relocate to states that have sane governors and bolster their support.</p>
<p>There's a handful of politicians right now that speak for us and we have to support them because if they're gone we have no one in a policy position that can block the economic and political attacks against us.</p>

        <p>Dont vote straight ticket, man.  All that will happen is theyll start manipulating us from the right.</p>
<p>What we need is to actively work to get citizen-level candidates who we vote in based on our consciences and values.  And then we hold them accountable.  Its ultimately up to us as individuals to make the changes and do the work in ourselves.</p>
<p>And honestly, i think this amc/gme situation is going to be a big catalyst of support.  The apes have spent the last 7 months watching blatant and disgusting corruption occur everyday in our stock market.  Apes have seen how ineffective and conflicted in interest our politicians are, and how the media works to cultivate a narrative to the masses that is false and works against us.  When it finally squeezes, there will be so many fucking apes who finally have the money and motivation to start making corrections to a system that has gone wildly out of control.</p>
<p>Theres a light in the darkness.</p>

        <p>I agree. I've just spent years voting for 3rd party candidates and it doesn't do anything. They've rigged the system to be a two party system, and with few exceptions both parties are effectively the same.</p>
<p>So I know what you mean, but our system doesn't work for the people. Voting is mostly just an activity we do to make us think we have a say in the system, meanwhile wealth has control over all the top candidates that actually stand a chance of winning.</p>
<p>So in general I agree with you but in this next round I'm joining the "lesser of two evils" camp and anyone who is anti-lockdowns and supports CHOICE in regard to these new vaccines will get my vote if they stand a real chance of winning.</p>
<p>Except Democrats, period. That party has lost me permanently and forever, no matter what. This is a "NEVER AGAIN" kind of situation.</p>
<p>It was bad enough when they made promises all those years and then looked for every excuse not to take action ... But now they are actually destroying this country.  And I don't mean that as hyperbole, I mean quite literally the country we once knew has become unrecognizable under their leadership.</p>
<p>But then it gets more complicated because I can make a strong case that the Republicans were in on it... Which leads me back to your advice.</p>
<p>But for now? I'll vote for whoever stands the biggest chance of defeating the Democratic party, period... And this starts with getting Gavin Newsome out of office.</p>
<p>We moved here a few months ago and are registered now to vote against him. It would bring me an absurd amount of joy to see him removed from office in disgrace... And it would send a powerful message to the rest of the politicians: you can censor us online but we still exist in real life.</p>

        <p>I've been a proponent of that for a long time. Red states do why they want, and can boot out the cities.</p>
<p>Balkanization is inevitable because the left keeps going off the cliff. Maybe then the right can boot out the neocons who are big government and pro war in the sandbox and we can solve the issue for a while.</p>

        <p>I think this ultimately degenerates into open violence somewhere along the line. I’m dubious about the government’s ability to maintain the monopoly of violence. We’ve already seen a willingness to allow violent actors carte blanche this past year, the cat is out of the bag.</p>

Im being very careful about the fact that Republicans are the ones protecting my rights FOR THE MOMENT but I will not owe them any allegiance once this is through and they want to invade another middle eastern country or something.</p>

        <p>I wonder what it will really be like. Establishment Republicans all thought that if they got rid of "Orange Hitler" then everyone would fall back in line and return to voting for decrepit money grubbing sleazewads like normal. But Trump's Power Level has only been increasing. Fuck dude I bet most conservatives basically consider Trump to be the President In Exile and Mar-A-Lago is the second capital of the country. I basically do at this point.</p>

        <p>He is the real president. Massive election fraud gave it to biden. Look at how the lying media jumped in unison to say that there was NO EVIDENCE of election fraud within a couple days of the election, before any sort of investigation could have possibly been completed. Then the DOJ even came out and said “no evidence” despite not actually performing any sort of investigation or looking for any evidence.</p>

        <p>What I think is weird is if this shit was happening in any country whose name ended in <em>-stan</em>, everyone in America would be outraged over the "blatantly stolen election" and would be sanctioning the 'president' as a dictator, and be demanding that he free political prisoners who demonstrated against the clearly stolen election. We'd be laughing at the blatantly one-sided State Media coverage and comparing it to Baghdad Bob in Iraq in 2003. Nobody would be able to believe that a guy who never even bothered to campaign, who was incredibly unpopular and picked the most unpopular politician in the entire nation as his running mate, who magically changed all the rules at the last second, won in a massive "blowout" victory of a landslide of votes at 4AM in elections that nobody is allowed to say anything negative about.</p>
<p>But it happened 'here'. And it's impossible to believe.</p>
<p>Even people in the USSR fucking knew their government was twisted and full of liars and literally everything their media said was a complete fabrication.</p>

        <p>Yup, feels like taking crazy pills. People either believe it but don’t care because it was their candidate who won, or they just can’t possibly comprehend that their media and government could be lying to them (despite mountains of evidence both contemporary and historical to that effect).</p>

        <p>Yeah I mean not to get too pedantic about it but let's say the patriot act then, it was republicans who greatly advanced and normalized large scale domestic surveillance of American citizens. No point going tit for tat on every individual point, each party throws us a bone once in a while before going back to rigorously pounding us in the ass.  So by all means, let the Republicans protect our rights for the moment but that is by no means intended to extend into a public mandate to do whatever else they want.</p>

        <p>But is it? We got this far because republicans were always so willing to compromise. But compromising is loosing. Left wants to ban semi autos, so the right compromises on fully autos. Then the left wants to ban semi autos again so we ban bump stocks. And we get microstamping. They don’t have much left to take with compromise before they take everything.</p>

        <p>You're right that it's not a recipe for long term survival as anything but a foil to the unceasing march to the left. </p>
<p>The question is whether they are complicit as a foil, or if that's just all they can do after losing the culture war so badly. I'm inclined to lean toward the latter, but I could certainly be convinced of the former.</p>

This line of them being the same could have applied 1w+ years ago, but the mask has slipped and the left is infected with a cancer that literally can only be described as Communism.

        <p>I get so sick of seeing this BS DEFLECTION argument. Because that is all it is is a deflection. It is whataboutism. Person: “look at what liberals are doing to our country” Deflector: “well they are both bad.” Call a spade a spade. I’m not referring to republican vs. democrat.
Most Republicans have proven to be scum too because they are hardly fighting. I am talking about liberal and conservative. Take a moment and look at the world today and tell me which side of that coin is perpetuating the vast majority of tyranny in the world today! Compare the COVID response in conservative states vs. liberal states, now tell me which ones have more freedoms? Tell me how many liberal run states have banned vaccine mandates? Are there any conservatives that are currently forcing proof of vaccination? Why not look up the tyrannical French president’s party? What about the Australian PM?</p>

        <p>Of course, because politicians suck and feed off power, but right now it is the tyranny of the left that is trying to force me to take medicine I do not want. It is the tyranny of the left that is telling me to wear a mask. Are they conservatives in NYC implementing the vaccine passport? If we don’t call a spade a spade then how will we ever fix the problem. There is nothing wrong with pointing out the obvious.</p>

        <p>Where are the Republicans stopping it? Where were the Republicans between 2016 and 2018, when they controlled the house, senate, and executive branch? For me, this is about more than just covid. This tyrannical takeover has been coming for years and the Republicans have sat around with one finger in their nose and another in their ass doing nothing to stop it. Neither one are worth my vote. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again but expecting different results.</p>

        <p>I am not here to defend republicans. They are weak and MANY have not fought hard enough during this time. Republicans can be liberal just as much as they can be conservative. My point is, when people are pointing out the current tyranny of the left, it is a deflection to bring up the right. It’s like when people bring up Biden pinching little girls nipples on camera and people say, “oh yeah well, what about Trump.”</p>
<p>However, I don’t really remember someone trying to force medicine into my arm, or telling me I can’t run my business, or that I must wear a mask then. Right now, when the tyranny is in your face, conservative republicans are fighting for liberty FAR more than liberal democrats. There are some exceptions (like Asa Hutchinson who is bought out by wal-mart). Again which states have and always have had more freedoms conservative states or liberal states? </p>
<p>What about Reddit in general? Would you say it has always leaned pretty hard left? Now go post some evidence against the vaccines and tell me how quickly alternate view points get shut down. What about MSM? What about social media?</p>

        <p>I think people confuse an ideology with a politician. An ideology represents ideals, thoughts, and feelings. A politician represents their own self-interest. The liberal ideology, in a classical sense, used to be one that represented liberty and constitutional guarantees. I am a classical liberal. The very word liberal is derived from the word liberty. However, you have a bunch of vipers that took that ideology and the word and perverted it. They twisted it and completely changed the meaning and they did so using emotional arguments.</p>
<p>A conservative, is what a classical liberal used to be, but with the goal of conserving traditional values.</p>

<p>To be fair, my teaching is what led to my mastery of (okay, proficiency in) the language. Knowing how to give orders to kids and play with Hangeul (they would yell at me when I first started putting Ls Rs Zs Fs etc in there, hilarious, but dann if they didn't improve their pronunciation brilliantly) and hanging with my yogis for 6am tea got me where I am.

<p>UK has Boris, isn't he a Tory and thus what passes for right-wing there? </p>
<p>Macron was portrayed as 'centrist' but he is an obvious gloabalist puppet hack. </p>

        <p>I think Boris is regularly heckled by those who consider themselves Tory in the UK and Macron ran as a liberal but has been called a centrist by his own party because (at least in the past) he was not to the left enough for them. Australia is run by a liberal PM and has a majority liberal parliament (but I can't speak to how anyone has voted on the issues there).</p>
<p>Let me make one thing clear. I absolutely hate republicans. Most of them are pretenders, but really and truly are globalist assholes who will sell our country's (sorry to assume you are from the US), inheritance to the highest bidder. However, there is an inherent difference between an ideology and a politician. Most politicians are scum, sucking the life out whatever they can (very much so at the national level). They truly dont have principles. They pretend like they do to get elected, but then sell us all out. </p>
<p>What I abhor is when the liberal left is called out for something they are doing, there is always someone who comes along and says "yeah, well they both are terrible." Can we not just stay on the topic of the absolute fact that most of the dilution of freedoms that have happened since the beginning of the pandemic have been perpetrated primarily by the liberal left? The facts are pretty clear this is true. Can we not call them out and say "hey liberals are doing really bad things right now." Without someone coming along and saying, "yeah, well what about how much conservatives suck." Why the deflection other than using it as an attempt to stop discourse? Yeah, I get it they both suck, but that doesn't preclude us from talking about the one that is sucking a bit more right now and trying to force me to take the jab.</p>

        <p>That depends. If the coin is "has national political aspirations", then potentially yes. </p>
<p>I'm a Floridian and am very happy desantis is governor right now, but I'm also cautious about the future because I don't know for sure if the things he says are because they are deeply held personal convictions, or because he wants to be the Republican presidential candidate down the line and that's what casts him in the best light.</p>

        <p>I don't think so. Establishment Republicans are slaves to their bank accounts. Honestly that's all their bullshit comes down to, they'll sell anyone up the river for more money.</p>
<p>Democrats are greedy money hustlers too, but they are also motivated by the pervasive pursuit of Absolute Power. They're ideological zealots, which is way more dangerous than simple greed. You can understand greed. You can control and direct it.</p>
<p>Ideological zealotry is dangerous because it can't be controlled or directed. That's how you get people like ISIS happily strapping bombs to their own children. </p>
<p>For all the bitching bout how Republicans are fascists, can anyone point to anything they have ever done that reflected an attitude of having some kind of divine dictatorial mandate to rule how everyone must think and function? All anyone can point to is abortion but that's pretty small potatoes as an issue, and it very much transcends being just a United States thing, it's controversial everywhere.</p>
<p>All Repiblicans want is fuckin money. Democrats are obsessed with power and having unquestioned regimented control over society. </p>
<p>Republicans never threw political prisoners into solitary, tortured them, and then stripped them of all their rights. Republicans never had unelected bureaucrats issue decrees stating that your rental home was now Property Of The State. </p>
<p>Even the fucking fact that Joe Biden has curated journalists with prearranged questions, that isn't even a fucking secret, somehow is ignored. This isn't how a free society functions, this is how an authoritarian regime functions.</p>

        <p>I had voted Democrat my entire life up until last year. I even worked for Obama’s campaign in college in 2008.</p>
<p>I haven’t become conservative all the sudden, my political views haven’t changed much. I still consider myself a classical liberal. I didn’t vote in the 2020 election, for the first time in my adult life (I don’t like Trump but I was hoping he would win - Biden is worse - but Trump wouldn’t have won in my county anyway.)</p>
<p>All that being said I’m going to vote straight Republican from now on, even though I don’t agree with them about everything. This covid shit has turned me into a single-issue voter. I didn’t leave my party, my party left me. r/walkaway</p>

<p>We seriously need to work on how we call things. No american party is truly liberal, most probably dont even undertstand what it means. I think that needs to be called out, everytime, vividly.</p>
<p>If you are in a conversation, it should go like:</p>
<p>You: "Im a liberal"</p>
<p>Them: "Oh, me too, glad you are voting democrats too."</p>
<p>You: *bursting into laughter* "I said liberal... why would I vote authoritarians?"</p>
<p>Them: "Huh?!? So you vote republican?"</p>
<p>You: *still bursting in laughter* "LIBERAL... L-I-B-E-R-A-L, not authoritarian..."</p>

        <p>i've had this discussion with so many people nowadays...</p>
<p>the dem vs rep and lib vs conservative distinctions don't really apply anymore.  it's fascist uniparty authoritarians vs american patriots.</p>
<p>if you believe in free speech, bodily autonomy, the right to self defense, non-discrimination, and a social safety net that helps people get back on their feet without inducing dependency... then you're an american patriot.</p>
<p>all dems and most reps in office, as well as most western media, are fascist uniparty authoritarians.  they've realized talking about direct taxes is pure smoke and mirrors, and they're slowly but surreptitiously raising taxes to 80%+ on everyone below the elite class via QE, and most people have no idea how it works or what's happening.</p>
<p>desantis is one of the few american patriots in office.  the solution isn't to vote for anyone who wants more power.  the solution is to vote in people who want to remove power from the government.  we've long past the threshold where almost everyone in government is corrupt and self interested.</p>

        <p>i'm saying once annually, 26 members of congress will be randomly selected, 13 from the house, 13 from the senate.  they will be forced to fight to the death til the last one is standing.  this eliminates the need for age restrictions and term limits, and ensures they're willing to literally die for their country.</p>

        <p>You’re not wrong, I should have voted, but honestly the main reason I didn’t is I had moved across the country 2 days before the election (with very little planning involved, it was an emergency “if I don’t get the fuck out of here now I might not be able to” situation, and sure enough, the shit state I was living in locked down hard again right after I left) so I had to unload and return the Uhaul. Most of my stuff is stored at a family member’s house in a different city about 10 miles away because I have a small 1-bedroom apartment.</p>

<p>Marjorie Taylor Greene is nuts, but she's exactly what we need, someone willing to speak truth to power and upset the apple cart and there's a lot of apple carts that need tossing.</p>
<p>and one major thing going for her is that you know she's got pure intentions. She's toxic, no lobbyist or corporation wants to be associated with her, so what would be the motivation to make yourself such a target for hate?</p>

<p>I understand we are on the same side, but it’s hard to not be disappointed in people who had their eyes open to this and still chose to turn away. This administration has been worse than I thought possible. Everything was on the line, and lots of people refused to do the right thing. And I seriously don’t know if our country can survive this now.</p>

        <p>Democrats have been Commies for some time, hiding behind fake support for women and minorities and gays and transgenders and the environment and the animals to push their totalitarian form of government. Trump is more classically liberal than today's Democrats or Republicans. He wants businesses to have freedom to operate and thrive, making money, employing people, and providing the goods and services that improve our lives, and h doesn't care what color you are or whom you sleep with.</p>

        <p>As someone who was a Bernie supporter (twice), I share this sentiment. Its alarming and while I know both parties are corrupt, atleast the Republicans posture as if they care about our individual freedoms. I am realizing that identity politics is useless and feel kind of embarrassed about how I used to carry on about them. The issue of personal freedom is a tangible issue that needs to be talked about, not a thought experiment. That's more important to me at this time of my life.</p>

<li>never saw trump try to frame a political opponent.</li>
<li>never saw trump endorse violence against political opponents.</li>
<li>never saw trump endorse violence against bystanders who take neither side on a political issue.</li>
<li>never saw trump sending stazi in the wee hours of the morning to arrest political opponents.</li>
<li>never saw trump coordinating with big business to do things that would be illegal if government did them.</li>
<li>never saw trump try to push government handouts and heavy regulations to manufacture corporate monopolies.</li>
</ul>
<p>these are all fascist cornerstones.  trump did none of them.  dems and the uniparty reps committed all of these crimes.</p>

        <p>I prefer DeSantis. Trump is very divisive due to his personality even though his policies were very on point. I appreciate what Trump brought to the table but he needs to let DeSantis take it over for 2024. He doesn't have the baggage that Trump does.</p>
<p>So basically share the exact same sentiments except endorsing the vaccine doesn't matter to me. DeSantis endorses the vaccine too, they both just do not endorse forcing Citizens to take it.</p>

        <p>As someone who votes Republican, I personally don't really care if women get abortions (I think it is a terrible thing but should still be legal). I don't really think marriage should be an institution 100% separate from the government. Don't really know what you are specifically referring to with the religious point. That being said, I feel like those issues take backstage to the kind of shit the Democrats are pushing for right now.</p>

        <p>Republicans are advocating against women being forced to take the vaccines. You can't honestly compare the vaccine issue to pregnancy. Pregnancy involves what one can legitimately argue to be two bodies, one of whom is a child and the other of whom is a parent, which means the government has a vested interest. The vaccine involves none of those things. COVID is not as dangerous to children as abortion is to an unborn child. Moreover, the individuals who may be harmed are not relatives of the individual supposedly doing the harming (yes, this matters, since there's such a thing as fiduciary and parental duty in law).</p>
<p>This comparison falls completely flat. There are good arguments over why governments should regulate abortion. There is no good argument as to why a COVID vaccine mandate is necessary, especially given the fact that upwards of 70% of americans have already gotten their dose.</p>
<p>It honestly doesn't matter what you feel about abortion, the comparison is apples to oranges. People can have legitimate disagreements about the issue of abortion, which is extremely complex. There is little doubt that if you support mandatory covid vaccinations you are pretty far on the authoritarian end of the spectrum.</p>

        <p>It's like the New York Times spent the bulk of the Trump Administration warning that Trump was a threat to our democracy and would usher in a new age of fascism.  Now the Times is advocating for those very same things in terms of covid policy.  For them authoritarianism/totalitarianism is just fine now.  In short they have become what they used to warn about.  They are not on the side of the people.</p>

        <p>I think your last paragraph captures my feelings. Like you, I've voted one party forever, and I'm not happy about it. Thing is, unlike you, that party is Republican. </p>
<p>I don't care for the pushy Christian stuff, and cop worshiping. I am absolutely a live-and-let-live "Republican", that never goes to church, thinks most cops are authoritarian bastards, and all politicians are an inch away from corruption.</p>
<p>I'd love to vote for, perhaps, a Libertarian candidate but, at the end of the day, either an R or D is getting elected. I have to choose the candidates that are most likely to leave me, my property, my income, my arms, and my personal autonomy the hell alone. That's all I really care about.</p>
<p>Thing is, most "civilian" Republicans I know (aka non-politicians) feel pretty much the same way. They just want to be left alone to pursue life, freedom and happiness.</p>

        <p>Not a chance. Gay marriage is a wedge issue that's a decade beyond relevance at this point, the new equivalent wedge issue is trans rights. The modern social media zombie democrats will never consider anything outside of republican=fascist at this point. Ironically enough.</p>

        <p>Probably true. I'm in support of gay marriage, or used to be, before I realized that it really is a slippery slope. Now I'm not sure what to believe. I am a Christian so I don't believe any church should be forced to recognize it, but that a gay couple should be able to get married legally. However, there are definitely holes in that logic.</p>

        <p>Pretty much the same. On the weed side of things look up what's going on with delta 8 and 10 thc. These are other cannabinoids like cbd that are close to the the delta 9 thc everyone knows and loves. They are psychoactive unlike cbd but compared to delta 9 it's like diet weed.</p>
<p>The 2018 farm bill legalized hemp and hemp derived products. So people started to isolate delta 8 and 10 from hemp plants and sell it, as tinctures mostly, as it was now legal in the country. In most red states that still had a ban on delta 9 they no longer had a ban on any other compound in marijuana. Now multiple states are banning delta 8. But it's mostly blue states that have banned while red states have not. Now what sense does this make? After decades some of these states finally legalized pot but are now making some other part of the plant illegal. It's crazy. It's clearly about money and not cutting into the legalized states new marijuana markets. So it was always about money for them, it was never about helping people or giving people access to drugs that could help them. Sorry for the rant, but it's just another thing I'm watching the parties flip on in real time.</p>

        <p>I honestly never met people on the right that really had a problem with gay marriage or weed. I think the media pushes this idea. Sure many church goers are on the right, but I think bible thumpers are in fairly short supply. Either way they are better then the people burning down cities and rioting every weekend. Never seen a Chaz at the Church.</p>

<p>Church goers are on the right because they don't want government telling them they can't go to church, which only the left does.</p>
<p>I'm not sure why anyone is surprised at this. If the leftists tomorrow told you you couldn't go to a nightclub, you can bet the nightclub-goers would become republicans pretty quick.</p>

<p>Is it because they support racial equality?</p>
<p>Oh wasnt it Lincoln who freed the slaves? Didn’t it take until 1964 and Barry Goldwater before the republicans decided to be segregationists and fight racial equality initiatives?</p>
<p>Is it because they expand the federal government to help people?</p>
<p>Oh wait Reagan created the largest federal department in existence? The department of Veteran Affairs. And vastly expanded Social Security and bailed it out for $165 billion? which Republicans today now want to dismantle?</p>
<p>Did he then increase pay roll taxes dramatically to pay for this? Did he also tax social security benefits of only the highest earners? But republicans today hate taxing the rich. How could they go so far right?</p>
<p>What’s funny is so many people in this thread are calling classic republicans RINOS like Romney etc because they themselves have become so normalized with the radicalization of the Republican Party.</p>

        <p>I'm a gay guy with strong social Liberal views.  I should be a stereotypical Democrat voter, but I have voted Republican the last 2 elections.  I take the "South Park" view of, I hate Republicans, but I hate Liberals more. I see at least in the gay community a group think mentality with no critical thought or reasoning. Democrats tend to be highly indoctrinated and yearn for authoritarian rule.  I live near the border of Mexico, been seriously thinking of stocking up on dollars and pesos (cash) to disappear for a while in a remote coastal area of Mexico to ride out the craziness in the US.</p>

        <p>It did that for a lot of people, including me. I woke up last year once BLM riots were encouraged and said to even <em>slow</em> the spread. It was actually a very clear red pill moment for me, as I kept waiting for the nationwide riots to be condemned just like other protests were, but it never came.</p>

        <p>Same. I marched (peacefully) at one of the major BLM marches in the country (I had already had COVID) --half the people had no masks, 10,000 people, zero social distancing. Then the media bent-over backwards arguing how it wasn't a "super spreader event" yet....a few weeks later, a poorly attended Trump rally in Tulsa was condemned as a super spreader. It opened my eyes.</p>

        <p>Welcome to the club. I was the same way. I came to the realization in 2016 when the mainstream left started using twisted Maoist language. I know conservatives cry communist WAY too much, but they're using EXACTLY the language games Mao and the Soviets did and it's getting worse.</p>
<p>You can still be a liberal. Opposing mandatory vax is the epitome of liberal belief. But that doesnt mean you have to continue to ally yourself with those that call themselves the same.</p>

        <p>Use to vote split ticket, voted Independent in 2012.  After that it's been pretty much Republican only.  After getting more involved in politics, watching some news (it's all trash), realized just how insane the corruption was.  Can't ever go back until that party fixes itself.

        <p>The Democratic party is the party of pro slavery, of jim crow, the party that completely opposed the civil rights. There was no switch, what happened was the democratic party changed to get with the times. Republicans didnt. Republican has always been about smaller government and the constitution. Democrats have always been anti constitution. </p>
<p>This whole attempt to remove peoples rights and transition to a tyrannical government can be prevented in the US thanks to the 2nd ammendment. All us others who have gotten our gun rights taken from us a long time ago dont stand a chance unless a really big portion of the population gets together like they did when the Berlin wall fell. </p>

        <p>I could've written this. I started turning from the left around the same time the gender bs and cancel culture ramped up, late 2019 for me. I've said this out loud to liberal, long time friends. One basically called me a pos idiot. 35 yrs of friendship gone. The other one said she admired me wanting to fight but considers herself libertarian and trusts neither side. Fair. Fair until she went on a whole SJW rant about how hard minorities had it and started trying to educate me. I dropped her too. Un fucking real.</p>

        <p>just throwing this out there, but there is a party that was touting anti-lockdown since the beginning and is a party that actually has the word Liberty in the party name.</p>
<p>should look into the Mises Caucus of the Libertarian Party, take human action, Dave Smith (part of the problem podcast), Ron Paul (G.O.A.T.), Scott Horton, Tom Woods....legends</p>

        <p>The Libertarian party is good in theory, but in practice they promoted a candidate for President who said "What's Aleppo?" in an interview.  They can't win on a national stage.  Run for School Board as a L, but you are limited to smaller races for the time being.  </p>
<p>Get the L to run as an R in the primary. That's the way forward.</p>

        <p>The 'what's Aleppo' thing was a dirty trick and I don't think it's fair. They were talking about issue A and then the reporter completely switched up and jumped to issue J, and Gary Johnson was still thinking about the first topic.</p>
<p>We've <em>all</em> done something like that before. He knew exactly what it was in the context of Syria, but he was thinking 'Aleppo' was some kind of program acronym or organization name.</p>

        <p>I was legit in the streets protesting on the first day of Floyd/BLM protests last summer. It's wild how much I've changed since then. I don't consider myself a Republican, and tbh I voted 3rd party in 2016 and 2020 so I guess I wasn't a good Democrat either, but... I've pretty much turned on most of the "liberal" (which I now recognize as <strong>leftist</strong>) ideals I weakly held, and now I realize that I hadn't actually spent much time reflecting on how I felt on issues - just accepted what felt right. Turns out it was all propaganda. Anyway, I feel ya OP, you are not alone.</p>

        <p>Lifelong republican voter, but I would not classify myself as republican. I am more conservative than the modern republican party. That is not to say that I want to force my conservative beliefs on others. I just don't want others to force their beliefs on me. Plus, they are a bunch of cowards. </p>
<p>If there were a way to have a viable third party candidate I would vote for them in every election. But, as it is your options are D or R. Right now R is the lesser of two evils. </p>

        <p>WikiLeaks in 2016 is what did it for me. That whole thing, combined with the fact that Bernie happily got on his knees for Hillary even after he was screwed.</p>
<p>Finally made me realize that everything that Trump is claiming about the media and the Democrats was right. It was a very tough pill to swallow, but walking away from the left decisions I ever made. Give me a better understanding of the world and allowed me to improve myself. It really honestly felt like waking up from the matrix.</p>
<p>Every year that goes by just red-pills me more and more. </p>

        <p>Our congress did to Trump what the Senate did to Julius  Caesar. They were afraid because he kept pointing out how utterly corrupt and useless the Senate was, and so they spun all these wild lies about how he was going to declare himself King of Rome and seize ultimate power, even though he pointedly rejected it. So they branded him a dangerous psychopath and hatched the plot to assassinate him, thinking they'd be celebrated as heroes of Rome for stopping Marble Hitler.</p>

<p>I supported Rubio over Trump in 2016 and even wrote in "Marco Rubio" when I voted.</p>
<p>I was never an unlimited free trade guy, and supported Santorum over the obviously fake ass Romney in 2012. And I thought Trump was fake back in 2016, and that Rubio was the guy for the middle class and poor. </p>
<p>Boy was I wrong.</p>
<p>President Trump delivered us the first and only Conservative electoral victory since Eisenhower's in 1956.</p>
<p>Pres. Trump isn't perfect and he's made several political mistakes but when you understand that he was literally surrounded by enemies from staff members to elected republicans you can understand how he could do so and how he could be waylaid.</p>
<p>Hell even Steve Bannon in 2017 said "firing Comey was a big mistake" and Bannon is the guy who got trump elected!</p>
<p>Conservatism isn't about open borders (cope and say porous borders if you want) or free trade. It's about ensuring the American family is strong, protected and united, that children are given a quality education like they used to be before the 1850's and 60's, that we lend people a hand in order to get them out of poverty not keep them chained to it, that the nation is well defended, that when a crime is committed our first priority should be <em>justice for the victim</em> not rehabilitation for the perpetrator, and that Christian morality is the driving force behind our beliefs and decision-making along with a strong dose of <em>realpolitik</em>.</p>

        <p>My family was in the same boat. We were liberal when this started. My mom saw a video of Candace Owens talking about how every 4 years the Democrats start another race war to guarantee the black vote. Then my mom listened to something from trump, and noticed that what he said isn’t at all what the media said he said. It just kept going from there, until after a few months we were conservative, or classic liberal (the liberalism from when my mom was a kid, modern liberalism is insanity), or right leaning centrists. </p>
<p>And lemme tell you, it’s liberating. You don’t constantly feel angry about everything or worried about everything the conservatives are doing. It’s so freeing. And going from one to the other gives you a unique perspective. You’re not just a liberal or just a conservative, you can see the truths and lies in both. It’s very eye opening.</p>

        <p>This might be an unpopular opinion on this sub. But there is quite a disparity between traditional Democrats.. and radical leftism. Im a conservative but know a lot of good, decent, hard working people who are Democrats. I come from a family of Democrats. That’s the way that I was raised. They’re not bad people, they just view the world much differently than I do. During Obama’s 1st term i was old enough to understand, and receptive enough to realize what was happening in American politics. </p>
<p>But the ideals of the radical left are growing, and in my opinion a lot of traditional Dems are afraid to speak up for fear of being ostracized from their social circles. They have lost control of their own party... it’s mob rule.. authoritarian logic churched up to look like “ the fight for equity” not equality mind you, equity. Meaning everyone ends up with the same thing. It is becoming ever more prevalent, and in turn... it is pushing the 2 parties further and further apart, just as some of the far right wing radical groups are take as examples of what the entire party stands for</p>
<p>But it is important to understand that none of this is an accident. There are forces at work here that by design, tear us apart as a nation. Take a look at Covid policy. People are drawing lines in the sand over vaccines, shunning one another for their personal choice. It trickles out of the television and spews out of social media. </p>
<p>The powers that be are completely fine with us bickering amongst ourselves, because it draws focus away from the real issues at hand.</p>

        <p>I was on the left until Brexit (I'm British). I voted for Brexit because it seemed like the morally right thing to do. The way the EU wants to control every aspect of it's nation states and the humiliating way they treated Greece, Ireland, Italy, Spain, The Netherlands (the list goes on) when they tried to go against the EU beaurocratic instrument, it seemed obvious to me that was the "liberal" choice.</p>
<p>Imagine my surprise when everyone on the left started using ECONOMIC arguments to fight AGAINST Brexit. I couldn't believe it. The people who always acted like they had the moral high ground were happy to continue on as normal as long as it meant they had the same amount of money in their pockets.</p>
<p>The facade of the left being the champions of free speech (do you remember that time?) fell apart within days of the referendum. I saw people who used to be critical thinkers parroting the same BBC mandated memes. It was surprising at the time, but over the years I realised...</p>
<p>There really is no left or right, just one small club and we ain't in it.</p>
<p>But IDEOLOGICALLY, the right is much more robust. It's very easy to manipulate the modern left. It's all about groupthink and dogma. It's very hard to manipulate the right as above all, they are individualists. It's much easier to manipulate one big group then millions of individuals.</p>

        <p>Republican party isn't perfect. But the future of the republican party is promising. People like Ron DeSantis are the future of the republican party. Also the fact that you mention morality policing shows how effective the democratic party has been in their marketing. This isn't the 60s, Republicans aren't trying to stop nudity in movies and art anymore. It's the dems who want to stop you from using certain words and participating in wrong think.</p>

<p>You described the timeline exactly.  It was approximately 2015 for me when things really started going off the rails. 2015 was when I really started to notice a deliberate departure from reality originating in the Media.  All leading up to covid, which is leading up to something else.</p>

        <p>🙋‍♀️ (disorienting, isn't it?)</p>
<p>But we don't have to automatically be Republican either. I've heard several times on here that the question isn't right or left anymore. The Dems are violating fundatmental principles of liberalism all over the place now and it's not like the Right hasn't colluded with corporations. What we're looking at is</p>
<ul>
<li>authoritarian vs democratic</li>
<li>centralized vs decentralized</li>
<li>transhumanist vs humanist</li>
</ul>
<p>And at this point - for whatever tiny bit it may be worth - I'll vote for anyone in any party that leans toward democratic, decentralized and humanist.</p>

        <p>In fairness, I think Republican is better then Democratic—and not in the sense of named political parties.</p>
<p>The issue with democracy is that it will <em>always</em> devolve into tyranny. Always.</p>
<p>The reason is that, in any bureaucratic organization, there will always be two sorts of people: The people who are dedicated to the mission, and the ones who are dedicated to the bureaucracy. Inevitably the latter sort always win—they never give up, and they never allow their attention to be diverted from their goals.</p>
<p>That’s why democracy always devolves into tyranny.</p>
<p>That’s why the founders created a republic with many competing bureaucracies: Their plan was for the senate to be the voice of the states (with senators being directly appointed by their state legislatures, and serving at the pleasure of those institutions), with the HOR being the voice of the people (with one rep per ~10k population)—the intention here being that the states would serve as a check against the growth of the federal government.</p>
<p>Then there were the three branches of the federal government, meant to fight among each other to maintain a status quo of equal power (i.e. no branch would let another exercise power it had no right to, because that would require stealing it from another branch, and upsetting the balance.).</p>
<p>In other words, a republic is a democratic form of government where bureaucracies are forced to fight amongst each other in order to maintain their initial power, leaving them no ability to expand their power.</p>

        <p>Can't really argue with any of this, and thanks for taking the time to write your thoughts! I've always been interested in the conversations and debates leading up to the Constitution, and I love the image of keeping all the bureaucracies so busy with each other that they stay mostly out of the way of the people.</p>

        <p>Democratic policy prays on peoples weakness, it tells them they're never to blame for their problems and all of their life failures can be fixed by taxing or taking from someone else.</p>
<p>Republican policy is about holding people accountable for their own lives, taking responsibility and putting in work to get the life they want.</p>
<p>I don't blame you for being a Dem for so long, it's intoxicating and rewards laziness. I myself was a democrat all the way up until I started working out, reading self development books and started dating more women. The fake "reality" the democrats told me existed crumbled before me when I decided to take responsibility for my own life and its outcomes.</p>

        <p>&rt;I was like that. Things started falling apart with the radicalization of identity politics. I really found the “American Left” hard to stomach up until 2019 but I was holding on.</p>
<p>2014 is when I started seeing the ugliness of the "woke left". I used Twitter a lot and watched mobs of wokeistas on it gleefully try to destroy the livelihoods of businesses and people they disagreed with. It was entertainment for them and gave them the thrill of ideological power. And I watched as institutions shielded these types of people (and often hired them). I'd long been a semi-radical leftist and began a process of questioning my beliefs and deprogramming myself.</p>
<p>The rise of the "woke" is paralleled in Mao's "Cultural Revolution" (that he used to cause disruption in order to regain power). It's not (yet) as severe but it's the same basic idea.</p>
<p>Many people, in both the left and the right to be fair, do not really believe in personal freedom or democracy. The neoliberal "left" (all over the map ideologically) currently dominate the West's institutions and political parties (often both the mainstream left and right ones) and very much don't believe in either personal freedom or democracy.</p>
<p>Neoliberalism has achieved hegemony in the West. If this isn't challenged we're going to lose our personal freedom and even the pretense of democracy. Researching these people shows that they've been working towards their goals for over a century and they command massive resources. Personal freedom and national sovereignty aren't things they respect.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, even though the conservative side is the side of freedom, both sides are incredibly corrupt. I used to be more conservative but have adopted a more libertarian view over the last few years.</p>

        <p>Oh no, not at all. I meant the actually government, not the people. When it comes to policy, I tend to agree with the more conservative side. As for the actual government though, they will just say and do whatever they need to for power, left or right.</p>

        <p>For what it's worth, most conservative aren't "down with Republicans" either. The neocon wing of the party is a grift that enables the excesses of the progressive left.</p>
<p><em>That Hideous Strength</em> by C.S. Lewis is a fascinating, sci-fi dystopian take on what happens when radical liberalism morphs into unchecked progressivism and wreaks itself on a society. From someone who was very much a classical liberal, it's an interesting read. One of my favorites from him.</p>

        <p>This is exactly it. If you ask most republicans, their complaint against the GOP is that they are too progressive, not that they are too conservative. Half the GOP politicians who are elected just serve as a roadbump for democratic, progressive, authoritarian policies. Hardly any actually put forth the alternative vision their voters hold.</p>

        <p>Voting is the joke of it all. Pretending people have their fate in their hands by voting for someone when you're 1 out of nearly 300 million. People need to have some semblance of feeling in control of their environment and that's the main piece of it. In the last few years, if looked at with an observant eye, you can see how well the theatrics worked to first divide people and then to politicize the moral compass. All coming down to fear and manipulation depending on many factors. Whether you live in a city or in a rural community. Grew up in a complete or broken home. From what parents were seen to do to ones own inception into society. This is why so many social circles these days are nothing more than small hive minded organisms. People getting together for a certain cause. What keeps people imprisoned is that these hive mind like social organisms don't much like little cells defecting and improving. They work like a self-regulating organism. Throwing out defectors.</p>
<p>In all honesty, WWIII isn't going to involve country vs country, it's going to be people against people in the same country. Why? Because of how different peoples experiences through life are. Only once people realize we're all in the same boat together will we stop demonizing people. We're distracted by the drama for a purpose. Social media, political division, and our altered means to communicate is the cause.</p>

        <p>My voting attitude since age 18:
2004: Bush administration is fear mongering over terrorism and taking people's rights. 9/11 was an inside job. John Kerry is incredibly well spoken, intelligent and free minded. 
2008: John McCain is a senile old rich white man who doesn't know where he is and Sarah Palin doesn't even read books. Obama is well spoken, eloquent and extremely down to earth. Obama is in favor of Healthcare for everyone, that sounds pretty good. I hope soon it will be legal for gays to marry.
2012: It's a no brainer choice, Obama keeps things peaceful and calm.
2016: Trump is a sexist idiot who has zero chance. Hillary will be an amazing president even though she's extremely unlikable. She's no Obama, but she's pretty smart.
2020: Hmm should I vote for Trump or Kanye?
All future voting decisions will go like this: Who is not behaving like a character in Brave New World? In all likelihood, the answer will be DeSantis and future Republican or Libertarian candidates, if the Libertarians are ever given a chance. From here on out, unless the Republicans start acting like the democrats are acting now or vice versa, I'll be voting red.</p>

        <p>similarly for me in my country. The previous Dutch Elections 5 years ago I went full left wing with Mark Rutte.  Now I was already starting to have doubts pre-covid about Rutte, but covid is certainly what tipped me over the edge of never voting for him again. </p>
<p>Last March i went much more conservative/right wing and went Geert Wilders. I never would have imagined 5 years ago that I'd ever vote Wilders, but yeah...</p>

        <p>In 1996 I was considered a liberal. My beliefs haven't changed much at all and now I am considered a conservative. </p>
<p>I vote by policy, not party, so I've voted democrat from time to time. Hell, I vote for Obama and he let me down big time. I voted Trump and was surprised at how pleased I was at the promises upheld, especially the day one ending of the TPP.</p>

        <p>&rt;How many of you all just 6 years agostill considered yourselves fairly liberal, probably voting democrat,generally over conservatives and their moral policing and prejudicesetc…?</p>
<p>6 years? 2 years ago I didn't have the guts to say I was a nationalist. The brainwashing is huge my dude. It took me months of reading to get out of that trance. The brainwashing was huge, especially in my part of the woods. TV's, friends, media, everybody thought the same. Huge fucking trance.</p>

        <p>Yep.  Voted Democrat until 2020.  (OK, I did vote for Trump b/c of immigration, otherwise all Dems in 2016.)  </p>
<p>It wasn't entirely Covid, though, although it's solidified my stance.  The Covid regime has shown me the tyrannical impulses of the libs, and I know that that is how I used to be myself.  </p>
<p>I really left the Democrat Party when the Democrat politicians and liberal media excused, hid, and aided widespread looting, vandalism, and assaults perpetrated by anarchists under the pretense of anti-racism.  </p>
<p>I am also not thrilled that SJWs want to destroy the culture I grew up in.  I have a right to a cultural history even if they hate it.  I don't like the Republicans - I haven't forgotten W - but if there's a choice, it's anything but the Dems.</p>

        <p>I'm Catholic so I always disagreed with the Democratic stance on abortion. But when I was in my early college years I figured my senators and congressman could be persuaded to vote my way if I just emailed and called and stuff. Besides that I actually thought Bush was right on national security issues for many years. I never liked Obama but I didn't mind the Clintons before Obama became president (Bill is a likeable guy). It was probably around the 2012 election when I realized how top-down politics was and how people in congress mostly just vote the way their party says to vote. </p>
<p>I did see something on Pew a few days ago and it said the percent of Americans who are becoming "consistently" conservative or liberal (i.e. not having more mixed political views) is on the rise. I'm worried that people are pretty much letting their party do their thinking for them.</p>

        <p>That’s exactly how it’s going.  Just take a look at the left and their stance on covid.   They are led to believe that anyone who questions the pandemic, Covid, mask wearing or the vaccine is a anti vax, anti science trump supporter.  That’s far from the truth.</p>

        <p>I was a Dem voter all my life and supported all of the bush-is-a-moron crap back during his terms. I laughed along with the daily show and thought steven colbert was funny. Then 2016 happened and I saw just how deceitful the people I supported had become. They had gotten so used to being in control and having the media in their pocket that they decided they didn't need my support anymore. That's when all the social justice stuff kicked into high gear, and suddenly I was a racist and misogynist and the society I grew up in was suddenly no longer acceptable to them, marking my beliefs as antiquated and wrong. Then I saw what they did to bernie and how they straight up admitted that they chose whoever they want and your primary vote doesn't matter (only to again prove in 2020 that none of my voting ever mattered). Then they did their 24/7 trump smear just like they did with bush. Only difference was that this time I wasn't laughing along because I knew it was all bullshit. At this point I am 100% done with the democratic party and their lies, double standards, and their incapability to be held responsible when they break the rules. The democrats are cheaters and will stop at nothing to win no matter who they have to hurt in the process. They are the fake nice guys that bully people into giving them what they want and then accusing everyone around them of wrong doing. Fuck anyone who still supports those people.</p>

        <p>Just posted something similar and got lots of pushback from friends… well also one person came out in support and that was really valuable. I still want the democratic promises, but there hasn’t been any of that. It’s like they used Burnie twice to secure democratic votes and handed them over. As much as I still dislike Trump and Republicans, at least they are questioning Wuhan lab funding and vaccine mandates. I never thought I’d be here.</p>

        <p>I completely relate to it. Slightly before covid I started having this realization that even though I had differing views with many Republicans, I felt respected in discussions while often with Democrats, whom I had overwhelming similarities with in my views, i often felt shamed and attacked. This one hundredfold once covid hit, along with my views changing, and I was done. DONE</p>

        <p>WikiLeaks in 2016 is what did it for me. That whole thing, combined with the fact that Bernie happily got on his knees for Hillary even after he was screwed.</p>
<p>Finally made me realize that everything that Trump is claiming about the media and the Democrats was right. It was a very tough pill to swallow, but walking away from the left decisions I ever made. Give me a better understanding of the world and allowed me to improve myself. It really honestly felt like waking up from the matrix.</p>

        <p>So to be fair, I don’t believe republican politicians to be much better on a whole than liberals, however the only people making noise and speaking up about this are from the Republican Party. Also, if you break it into core values, I find much more in common with conservative values than liberal (which I don’t actually see any discernible values, other than ‘we need the govt for everything’)</p>

        <p>The trouble is that the Republican Party IS the party in the middle.</p>
<p>Over the last 50 years, everyone purged from the democrat party for not being leftist/authoritarian enough has migrated to the Republican Party. That has shifted both parties significantly to the left (although the Dems have shifted a lot further/harder).</p>
<p>The truth is that a lot of the most undesirable components of the current conservative platform are positions brought by people fleeing the democrat party.</p>
<p>For example, a lot of the moral panics come from people like southern baptists, who used to be a core democrat voting bloc.</p>
<p>What we need is a party that’s actually pro-liberty, rather than a party that’s just democrat light.</p>

        <p>Welcome to the true resistance. I'm not sure if I can label myself truly conservative, moderate or classical liberal. I believe in individualism, but understand collective action sometimes is necessary. I believe in classical liberalism, but conservative with monetary policies and personal responsibility. I believe consenting adults can do as they please, as long as they don't exploit what I see as sinful nature. Seriously, don't show off. The nuclear family is what needs to be preserved. Don't like the idea of war and violence, but I know how to fight. Diplomacy but sometimes war is necessary for peace. </p>

        <p>Same. I was a registered Democrat until July '20- although I couldn't bring myself to vote for a democrat for some time, I was holding out hope that the party would weed out the lunatics within the party and restpre some kind of dignity.  Instead they acquiesced to the nutcases who used the opportunity to become more radical. </p>
<p>Everything from their love affair with Covid, to the rioting, and overt destruction of constitional rights made it pretty easy to go independent/libertarian.  #walkaway</p>

        <p>Unfortunately at this time all politicians are corrupt but just some slightly less then others. It also changes with time as who is more corrupt. All you can do is vote according to the time and who you believe lies less. Never ever vote on election promises, these are never ever ever ever kept. I was a left supporter and now am a strong right supporter because of this defund and woke shit.</p>

        <p>In this war against the radical left, sometimes you do have to make alliances to take down their brand of evil. That whole "divided we fall" thing works here very well. </p>
<p>Do you think you could vote in people to beat the democrats if the opposition is splintered into several different groups that would never amass enough votes by themselves to win? You could throw your vote away to some tea party or some other independents or you could ally with other like-minded folks to vote in the lesser evil.</p>

        <p>Actually we should stop thinking in terms of "rep vs dem" or "red vs blue". We're all human. And this is against all of humanity. No matter whose involved if its democrats or republicans or even the left and the independent, what's the point anyway? We can't wait for some sort of "saviour" or vote for one and think everything's going to be fine then. It wouldn't. It's them (1%) vs US (99%).</p>

        <p>Adding on to my previous comment especially for those doomers who may read this.  </p>
<p>I never voted before until 2016. I voted for Hillary.  She wasn’t my first choice but I did not want trump to win.  Same with 2020.  I still didn’t want Trump to win again but also didn’t really want Biden.  I mean both years the candidates sucked.  </p>
<p>I DO care about people but my level is care depends on who you are.  If you are close to me then I tend to care more. I’ll put more effort because we are close.  If you are some random stranger then I only care with the most basic level of respect.   I don’t feel I have to make drastic life changes just to please you.   I won’t be an asshole and purposely make you sick and if you were in danger I’d help, but aside from that I don’t care what happens to you.  Do you care about that one person you saw in the store in asile 6 14 years ago? Don’t remember? What about the one 3 weeks ago? Exactly my point.  </p>
<p>This was never an issue before March of 2020.  No one put this much effort, care and passion in to health before hand and now it’s an issue? Even with past things like Ebola, swine and bird flu? </p>
<p>I’m not anti-vax.  Hell I may still end up getting it, I’m just against forcing it on people.  Same with the mask.  It should be a personal choice.  I still wear one where required but the second it’s not it’s coming off.  </p>
<p>I’m still left leaning on many social issues but some of them can be a slippery slope.  I do agree taxing billionaires but that would mean changing the tax code but no side wants to do that and instead they are crying that they went to space instead of helping people. </p>
<p>It also seems the left is in this almost high school like phase especially on many left leaning social media pages like the other 98, being liberal etc  to where they are too busy making memes comparing the left vs the right or always talking about trump despite him being out of office for 8 months already.  Its like give it a rest. </p>
<p>Both parties clearly suck but I do agree with republicans on the whole lockdown and mandate thing.   I don’t agree with their crazy conspiracy theories though.</p>

        <p>I’m very fed up with the dems, but I still see GOP as a bigger threat. Money in police/campaign finance/voting rights is something that the democrats should be fighting for wayyy harder but the gop is actively going against it. </p>

        <p>Voting: Not. Even. Once.</p>
<p>Vote? For who!?</p>
<p>When the choices are seemingly always bad &amp; worse, thee only logical decision is to choose none.</p>
<p>This country was bought &amp; paid for long ago, just because they give you a 'choice' so you feel like you've done something/have an actual say (Ha!) doesn't mean all of us have to take part.</p>
<p>Plus, I'm not responsible for any of these fools who have ever held office, so when things are as they are, I'm not to blame &amp; am literally one of the only few allowed to point fingers &amp; complain because none of my poor choices caused any of this by putting the lesser of 2 evils in office, ever.</p>
<p>2 branches of 1 government is the same team behind closed doors, like it's seemingly been forever, regardless which 'set' they publicly claim or Red &amp; Blue 'Gang Colors' they fly.</p>
<p>No one gets into that line of work for anything other than money, take all the funds out of politics &amp; watch them scatter like the roaches they are.</p>

        <p>The two-party system is an illusion. They're both owned by the same interests. </p>
<p>It's like wrestling. Everything decided in advance. You have your heals and your faces.  People cheer for their "guy".  They think he'll fix it.  But they don't. And they won't. They're not there to serve us, but themselves and their masters who feed them.  The point is to turn us against each other so we don't go after those who really run our world.</p>

        <p>same here bro</p>
<p>I still see myself as progressive, but mainstream progressives i use to follow in terms of political views were just fearmongering and were being SJWs. The thing is, Trump to the democrats was the perfect punching bag, sometimes it was correct. Covid was pretty much the breaking point in terms of me going along with them. When i figured out that the death count wasnt actually accurate in terms of people dying FROM Covid and yet people on the left took it at face value, i abandoned at that point. Basically when the talking point of " trump let 1000s of people die!" was pretty weak in terms of argument.</p>
<p>At this point Democrats are gonna be completely fucked come the mid terms and they deserve it for sure. Because its pretty obvious at this somehow they think they will stay in full control as long as covid is around and they can basically mark people dont wear masks or get the vaccine as Republicans which is funny considering black people are one of the lowest % of people getting vaxxed LOL. But yeah, the fact vaccine passports and mask mandates are being heavily pushed by democrats is gonna bite them hard.</p>
