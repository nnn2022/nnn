    <strong>It's obvious why there's so many retards who aren't bothered by the lockdown</strong>
    <p><p>Talking primarily about Gen Z here (my generation). Already the most socially awkward and obliviously miserable generation before the "pandemic" happened. Enslaved to technology. Social media is the real disease. The real "virus." It fucked up our social dynamic post-2010. Every generation forward is going to ride the waves of this shitstorm and kids growing up in this era will probably have an even worse mental health decline.</p>
<p>Since people are already used to spending sunrise to sunset unlocking, scrolling and tapping on their smartphones like a bunch of zombie biological baboons, why would it bother them if the government forces them to? I've seen a few posts from people who genuinely don't even want the lockdowns to fucking END. They are not only complying with this lifestyle but this is like a EUTOPIA to them. Yeah they're probably in the minority but I can guarantee you there's a lot more people with that mentality who don't say anything. Something that would have been part of a dystopian sci-fi film 20 years ago is becoming semi-normalized. Who knows what's next..</p></p>

        <p>Yeah this has made me really aware of how badly gen z has been inundated by social media and what it's done to them.  I talk to my younger cousins and it's as if they don't even realize holding an opinion is something they can and should do.</p>

        <p>Honest answer from my daughter (21).
She's quite sociable but has usual insecurities related to social media... For last year she has admitted to being less stressed as she doesn't feel the same pressure to be getting made up, posting photos, choosing new outfits etc, then having them critiqued online.</p>

        <p>There are some smart Gen Z people that know it's all fake dated a Gen Z woman 20 years and she knew the mainstream media was not trustworthy, she can think for herself and knows politicians are liars too didn't fall this covid scam at all and she knows propoganda is being spread and I got two Gen Z brothers that don't fall for this scam too, there's still hope for Gen Z most Gen Z liked the freedom on social media but they don't like censorship at all and they hate it when they are getting censored too.</p>
<p>A lot of Gen Z people are already getting censored too for speaking out against government actions recently a Gen Z woman went to a school with no mask  to prove how fascist the people working at the school are reacting, the workers pushing the masks didn't even seem to care about human rights, there's still hope for Gen Z once they realize their freedom is being taken away by a lie.</p>
