    <strong>What do you suppose causes the majority of people to not question this virus and the dystopian measures implemented to “flatten the curve”?</strong>
    <p><p>So, totally honest, I don’t consider myself to be particularly smart. And feel like I tend to be fairly gullible. That’s what baffles me. I don’t know how <em>I</em> recognize this bullshit, but people that I know for a fact are (in general) smarter than me have fallen for it hook, line, and sinker.
I just don’t understand why two people as incredibly average and unremarkable as my husband and myself are questioning this, but so many aren’t. It just doesn’t make any sense to me.</p></p>

<p>So it is more comforting to pretend "All is well, we're in good hands" than it is to know "Shit is supremely fucked, and if I don't do something my children will be slaves.".</p>

        <p>Because it’s not about intelligence.</p>
<p>Some of the most “intelligent” people in my life are the most doomery. Because they have no sense of self. They perform in their lives and on social media in order to feel good about themselves. Their worldview is that bad things happen to bad people, good things happen to good people, and if they follow all the rules, good things will happen for them as well.  For the most part these people are also married or in relationships and have stable jobs. So they never were truly isolated like those of us who live alone, nor are they feeling the economic hardship. </p>
<p>They also tend to be more liberal, and a trend I’ve noticed with my liberal friends is that they’re always outraged by something. It’s always someone else’s fault for why something bad is happening, instead of it being something unavoidable or inevitable. People only die because the system failed them, not because perhaps they were unhealthy or old or sick in some way. People are only poor because of racism and oppression, not because they have no marketable skills, are lazy or are bad with money. </p>
<p>Their reality is based on mainstream media, Twitter trends, and an idealistic view of how the world and people in it SHOULD be, as opposed to how they really are. To them, people SHOULD just stay home as long as needed; but this goes against human nature, so most people actually aren’t capable of isolating long term. But doomers can’t or won’t acknowledge this, probably because it would threaten the satisfaction they get from feeling like they’re better than everyone else. </p>
<p>There are exceptions to this last point, but the most doomerish of people I know are also the least religious. They don’t have any higher beliefs besides some loose sense of karma or cosmic justice. I’m religious myself, so I know this will come across as hating on atheists, but it really isn’t. It’s just my experience as someone who has been on both sides of the belief spectrum that believing in a higher power gives me a lot of peace in situations I can’t control.</p>

<p>I am atheist myself. I have observed the same as you, that atheists seem especially susceptible to the covid sophistry. I think you also hit on the reason, which is man's inherent desire to exert control over the outcomes of their life. I've personally always accepted that life is in many respects random and uncontrollable. I suppose those who are religious are, as you note, more at peace with this lack of control as well.</p>
<p>I don't know if you're familiar with the economist Thomas Sowell. He touches on some of the same topics you raise. Here's a quote from an interview he gave in 2018:</p>
<p>&rt;It's amazing whenever you look for facts, when you do research either about people or about nature, you find skewed distributions everywhere. But when you listen to people talk, especially in the academic world, the underlying assumption is that people all have the same capability, and that therefore any differences in their outcomes must be due to other people in some way doing them wrong. It's amazing because if you think just of an individual, the same man does not have the same capability. He's not even equal to himself at different stages of life, much less being equal to all other people. They're highly varying stages of their lives.</p>
<p>I find that those who fall in lockstep with the covid narrative also strongly adhere to the worldview Sowell describes above.</p>

        <p>From what people have told me, they can’t wrap their head around the fact that SOO many countries would be in on such a devious plot. Tbh, I can barely even wrap my head around that. It is not just prime ministers/presidents who run the countries- there are hundreds, if not thousands of government officials who have to be on board for every country. I have to admit it does seem wild that so many people/countries are in on it.</p>

        <p>It's funny you say that, because on the one hand, it seems beyond imaginable that all politicians are steepling their fingers in malicious glee over all of this. On the other hand, the same politicians (at least in NA) are regularly disregarding their own rules;</p>
<p>decreeing lockdowns from their Mexican vacations,</p>
<p>travelling to celebrate holidays they tell everyone else to stay home from,</p>
<p>going maskless and ignore social distancing after telling others how important it is,</p>
<p>closing small business while allowing large caterings 50 feet away, housed under exactly the same conditions.</p>
<p>We could look at any one example and just say, "Oh, Newsom/Pelosi/etc is an idiot for not following their own rules." But it's not just one example - it's one of many, many examples. It's clear that nearly all politicians don't actually care about the rules. The <em>head of the Coronavirus Task Force</em> does not care about following her own decrees. They can't take it seriously, so it's hard to wonder why the rest of us should.</p>

        <p>This is often the biggest roadblock I run into when talking with doomers as well--this notion that "surely all these thousands of experts and officials around the world can't <em>all</em> be wrong!"</p>
<p>It strikes me as bizarre for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's not a logical argument. It's a textbook example of appeal to authority. You choose to believe in something because other people in authority say it's true. Now, that in itself doesn't mean they're necessarily wrong--however, it <em>does</em> mean that there is nothing logical about your position. There is no logical argument that says 'X is true because a thousand experts say X is true.'</li>
<li>Human history is rife with examples where experts believed something to be true that was in fact completely false. We are not that far removed from a time when bloodletting was a common medical treatment. More recently, the drug thalidomide led to birth defects in children. I find that those who insist that "so many people can't be wrong" are simply not well read on human history (though of course they always purport to be very well read and also very <em>scientifically</em>-minded).</li>

        <p>I just watched The Lost City of Z https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1212428/, terrific movie btw definitely recommend it. </p>
<p>The story is about Percy Fawcett, and English explorer who disappeared in the Amazon. He argued that there was evidence of vast ancient cities and civilizations deep in the Amazon. The entire Royal Geographic Society in London believed that it was impossible for "savages" in the Amazon to have constructed large cities, bridges, etc. These were knighted men, top scientists, top military minds, captains of industry, etc. who were <em>all completely wrong.</em></p>

        <p>I’ve been thinking about this a lot myself.</p>
<p>I have a memory from childhood. We were watching some twenty minutes type show on tv about something. It was during the Cold War so maybe it was something about nuclear weapons. Whatever it was, I was traumatised. I ran to my bedroom and cried.</p>
<p>Because of this experience and many more like it over the years I realised I was triggered by emotionally manipulative words. I’m still like that. I can easily cry from something as simple as a commercial. </p>
<p>When I realised this years ago I just stopped watching stuff I knew would wind me up. I don’t watch the news, I don’t watch stuff I know will make me cry unless I want to. I don’t watch tv as to avoid commercials. </p>
<p>Also, my mother was emotionally manipulative. I’ve had boyfriends in the past that also tried to manipulate me. I go out of my way to avoid feeling manipulated, or to manipulate anyone else. It’s a huge issue for me. </p>
<p>This is one of the reasons I feel like i, not a smart person, have been able to avoid being sucked in to the narrative.</p>

        <p>It may be because you're not particularly smart, actually.  Consider the Chernobyl disaster: what set it off was, essentially, smart people pushing the power they could get from the reactor by ignoring safety limits (and forcibly disabling multiple pieces of safety equipment, too).  People of average or lower intelligence are less likely to question rules; they figure "that's what the limit is" and just accept it.  Intelligence has a nasty tendency to make people think they're immune to brainwashing, or making stupid mistakes.  It can even stop the self-reflection necessary to correct mistakes they DO make: "I did that, and I'm smart, so it must be right".</p>
<p>The other thing I see a lot of these days is the danger of specialization.  I went to a great books college, and learned a crapton about the history of ideas and how thoughts and methods develop (incredibly useful stuff to know; practically impossible to quickly summarize).  And almost every college graduate I encounter not only perceives the world through a single lens, but thinks that it's entirely possible to do so and still see and appreciate everything that you experience.  You may know everything there is to be known about medicine, but if you don't know squat about economics, you probably shouldn't be the only one setting policy.</p>

        <p>"Smart/intelligent" does NOT mean wisdom. The idiot society has been brainwashed to think that autistic (STEM) style "intelligence" is the ultimate of everything. Wisdom comes after much experience and "big picture" thinking. Quite frequently (so called) average (or even "dumb") people have gut feelings that they can't put into words, but they *just*know* when something smells wrong. They follow their gut and avoid the looming trouble. However, the "smart" (scientific) people deliberately ignore data that does not come in through their myopic little definition of reality, so they fall prey to anything that is "dressed up" to look "correct" within their limited data set. They make jokes about "gut feeling" as being irrational, however, Evolution has developed this facility as an instantaneous way of avoiding danger that happens too fast (or sneakily) for the "intellectual brain" to process.</p>

        <p>For some, it is the feeling of superiority they feel when they go along with the crowd to shame people for doing "wrong". I'm witnessing it on my social media. I had to delete two already because it got unbearable. They're more angry than scared. The kind of people that were already insufferable, angry trolls before 2020. </p>
<p>And then you have the actual idiots who are scared out of their wits of dying and stupidly think wearing a thin piece of cloth will save them. They aren't rational whatsoever. If they were really scared of the virus, they'd stay the fuck home. When they are home, they constantly watch the news for more case or death updates and blame normal people who don't wear masks for everything. These people will wear masks the rest of their lives. </p>

        <p>Anger has been rising online since Facebook etc came on the scene. I’ve watched the internet turn from a free lucky go happy anything go’s place in the 90s to a corporate mind manipulation tool in 2020, where we are literally all fighting each other all the time on all issues.  Tune out of the internet it was only good in the early days before it was hijacked from the people to Facebook/google.</p>

        <p>I've been pondering this a lot, particularly in the last few days. I had joined a discussion on FB about lockdowns and posted a page from AIER listing 24 papers that didn't find any relationship between lockdowns and infection rates. The response I got from someone was a very long post discussing how AIER is funded!</p>
<p>My view is that this person was suffering from cognitive dissonance. She is presented with a slew of evidence that challenges her world view. To accept this evidence would mean that she has been duped, all the money paying for lockdowns has been wasted and people have died unnecessarily from lockdown effects. This would be a huge blow to her ego, so, instead, she finds a way to traduce the source of the challenging literature. That way she doesn't have to read it and feel like a fool.</p>
<p>To be fair to her, and to the others in her position, it is a hard lesson to accept: that scientists and governments are all deluding themselves. Also, she has probably been bombarded with propaganda for most of a year. I don't expose myself to many mainstream media but when I turn the radio on in the car I am appalled by the relentlessness of it, both in paid-for advertising and in the constant chatter of the presenters reinforcing the mainstream narrative.</p>
