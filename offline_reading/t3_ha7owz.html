    <strong>I‚Äôm worried about so many governors holding up full reopening until there‚Äôs a vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>Something feels very wrong about this motive. I see it as one of a few ways:</p>
<p>-Governors aren‚Äôt ready to give up their control yet or admit they were wrong, so it‚Äôs yet another moving of the goalposts.</p>
<p>-They don‚Äôt know or care about second order effects so they can use the lack of vaccine to institute further ridiculous and expensive guidelines on businesses and individuals.</p>
<p>-So many of their constituents are still panicked about even a slight rise in cases. Not hospitalizations, not deaths, cases. The ‚Äúno full reopening until a vaccine‚Äù seems like a good way for them to keep making rules that pushes eradication of the virus and please the still terrified public. </p>
<p>But overall, I don‚Äôt understand why we have to wait for a vaccine and we will lose way more than we already have and the public will get more enraged. There might be restaurants and salons who can‚Äôt operate at half capacity and afford a ton of new cleaning and safety measures and survive. You‚Äôre going to hold the ‚Äúno vaccine‚Äù over people to keep them from having fun since festivals, fairs and pro sports will continue to stay canceled, or the prices will be higher so only the wealthy select few can attend, shutting out the public who have already sacrificed enough, hence the further anger. Without ‚Äúmass gatherings‚Äù smaller cities and towns will have financial issues and more jobs will be lost. And something about telling people they can‚Äôt do certain activities without a vaccine feels very unethical. Like you already took away my risk assessment and freedoms enough! Stop putting possibly unrealistic measures on them. (After all, a vaccine could come anywhere from tomorrow to September, or a year or four years from now depending on who‚Äôs making the prediction.)</p></p>

        <p>I'm more worried about this lightly tested and extremely suspicous vaccine being forced upon us. I'm no anti-vaxxer, but most vaccines we get have been in use for decades and we know very well how they react with the human body. I'm not quick to trust one that was thrown together in a couple of months.</p>
<p>I'm very concerned about dystopian level regulation forcing people to get the vaccine, wristbands and screening to make sure you have it before you are allowed anywhere. My workplace has even talked about forcing us to get the vaccine when it comes out as a condition of continuing employment.</p>

        <p>It's never been about your health. It's more about power, control, about restructuring society. Covid is just a convenient opportunity to move forward with things that would otherwise have been untenable, like global mandatory vaccinations and immunity passports. Within the context of "such a deadly unprecedented virus", people are groomed to think all these permanent changes make sense.</p>
<p>This is happening everywhere, it has nothing to do with any particular US governor or the US altogether. They're all regurgitating the same playbook word for word. It's true, but you'll be labeled a conspiracy theorist if you say so.</p>

        <p>Maybe the vaccine is the reason for the lockdown, in order to pressure the public to accept an untested rna injection.</p>
<p>The bi-partisan nature of the vaccine putsch is disturbing. Remember "Operation Warp Speed" , Trump's militarized vaccination program.</p>

        <p>I find it extremely frightening. I was never against "regular" vaccines, but the non-stop pressure from the media and the politicians to get this particular vaccine is very concerning, to say the least. Since the very beginning, everyone's focus has been on a vaccine. Not a medicine, not eliminating the virus, but specifically a <em>vaccine</em>. In other words, something every healthy human being will be expected to take, <em>or else</em>. They didn't isolate and take freedom away from only sick people, either. They isolated and locked down <strong>everyone</strong>.</p>
<p>There are news articles about companies who are already rushing to produce hundreds of millions of doses of their new vaccine before the trials even ended.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/astrazeneca-scores-1b-from-u-s-signs-up-to-deliver-hundreds-millions-covid-19-vaccines">https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/astrazeneca-scores-1b-from-u-s-signs-up-to-deliver-hundreds-millions-covid-19-vaccines</a></p>
<p>So many news outlets are casually taking about billions of doses of this new vaccine, a vaccine that <strong>needs</strong> to be <em>accessible on a global scale</em>. I'm starting to feel anxiety every time this subject comes up. <strong>Did the billions of people those doses are meant for gave their consent?</strong> What the hell is going to be put there? Why are the governments of the world so desperate for everyone to be injected with this (officially still hypothetical) vaccine?</p>

        <p>I feel unease about this, too, as well as about "forced" COVID testing.  My retired medical professional mom advised me <em>not</em> to get the test performed unless administered by an actual ENT specialist.

        <p>Massachusetts is terrible.  We're not permitted festivals, amusement parks, concerts, professional sports, or even bars and nightclubs "until there's a vaccine".  In-person school even looks like a long shot.</p>
<p>I'm not sure the people in this state understand the severity and possible consequences of these regulations.  A vaccine typically takes 4 years or more to develop,  even longer if you want to test it appropriately.  </p>
<p>Amusement parks and other entertainment venues aren't just going to hang around for 4 years waiting to reopen.  They will go out of business and never open again.  Bars and clubs will shutter forever.   Even our beloved Red Sox and Patriots might find a new home if the money is somewhere else with fewer restrictions.  </p>
<p>Once a vaccine is available,  this state will be a virtual wasteland.  I think the majority of people are willing to live their lives with the risk of COVID, rather than lose life as we know it.  The government feels like it needs to make choices for us.</p>

        <p>Technically, it‚Äôs until better treatment or a vaccine, but no one ever talks about the possibility of a treatment. People are so hung up on the idea that this vaccine is coming soon and that they can easily wait it out. And Baker seems to be more focused on increasing PPE production. I actually have a public health background and am baffled by the response.</p>
<p>I feel sorry for local businesses. I‚Äôve read the restrictions for some that are now opened and there are so many rules that the idea of going stresses me out.</p>

        <p>I think the average person didn't really read into the Phases.  Many people I've spoken to are under the impression that Phase 4 will start 3 weeks after Phase 3.  They don't realize Phase 4 could be years down the the road.  To be fair, the media isn't helping with this.  If honest headlines like "Six Flags will not open this year" and "Future of Gillete Stadium unknown" were published,  people might start questioning Baker's leadership. </p>
<p>As for a better treatment, it seems like people will argue about any possible medication for years to come.  It's ridiculous. </p>
<p>I hear you on being ambivalent about going to businesses.   I shop as little as possible.   Not because I'm afraid of COVID by any means, but because of the power hungry way some store employees behave.  I haven't yet gone for a haircut.. but I guess blow drying of hair isn't allowed.  "Like what the heck?"  I saw some poor souls get rained on during outdoor dining the other day.  Even when indoor dining is allowed here in a few weeks, I'm not sure I'll go.  I can't enjoy a meal having restictions barked at me the whole time.</p>

        <p>Getting rained on? At some restaurants in my PA county, they tell you if it rains, they‚Äôll help you box your meal and you have to leave, If you don‚Äôt have your order yet, they‚Äôll bring it to your car when it‚Äôs done. </p>
<p>Luckily we can open indoor dining this Friday. But only at half capacity. Salons can open too but they‚Äôre all going to be weeks and months behind and my stylist hasn‚Äôt even returned my call yet. I didn‚Äôt have an appointment scheduled before  COVID, so I probably have several weeks more of trimming my own hair without getting rid of too much. They also can only run at half capacity with a million other rules. Spas can‚Äôt do massages or facials. </p>
<p>My mom and I think people will choose carefully where they go after this. I know we‚Äôre taking notes of businesses who are more extreme than others and we won‚Äôt go to the ones with too many rules.</p>

        <p>Yep, getting rained on. It's a fairly upscale restaurant.  They're just not designed or prepared for outside dining.  I hope the restaurant had some kind of plan to box up the customers' meals.  All I know is those people looked so miserable.</p>
<p>I hear Rhode Island,  which is 30 or so minutes from me, has indoor dining with a laid back atmosphere.  If i'm going out to eat it might be worth the trip.</p>
<p>We got hair salons and barbers back at the beginning of June.  I have to wait until July 3 for my appointment.  The salon sent me a list of rules I'll have to follow while there.  I have to call when I get there, and wait by a side entrance wearing a mask.  Someone will let me in, and I'm only allowed to bring a credit card and phone with me - no purse or extra items.  The stylist is not allowed to blow dry my hair, so I'll be leaving with sopping wet hair.  Sounds like a miserable time, but I need a haircut. </p>
<p>I brought my boys to a barbershop in an inner city area, and it was much less complicated.  We had to wear masks and there was plexiglass between the chairs, but that was the only thing unusual.  I also had to sign a paper with my name and phone number,  I assume for contact tracing.  Someone suggested next time I should leave a fake name/number, which is what I'll be doing when I'm finally back at church.</p>

        <p>There are some salons here where you can‚Äôt bring your purse either, and that makes no sense to me. Do purses spread the virus now? I saw one salon that won‚Äôt even let you pay at the reception desk to ‚Äúavoid contact‚Äù and ‚Äúwaiting in line‚Äù so you pay from your chair with the stylist who‚Äôs using an iPad. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever waited in line to pay for my haircut LOL. They act like you‚Äôre packed into a line at the front desk similar to the grocery store.</p>

        <p>Car keys weren't mentioned, but I assume they're just something to be kept hidden away in your pocket.  The 2 things permitted are cell phone (to call that you've arrived) and credit card (no cash allowed). I'm hoping there's no cavity search but nothing will surprise me nowadays.</p>

        <p>True. The people I talk to think each phase is automatically 3 weeks apart and that when things open they are back to normal. They have no plans to go anywhere so they don‚Äôt bother reading all the restrictions involved. </p>
<p>I have a hair appointment next week and yes, no blow drying (plus masks, wait outside until I get a text to come in, and some other rules). My friends think I am taking a huge risk because all they picture is a crowded salon.</p>

        <p>Honestly I feel a hair salon is a lower risk than the local Walmart or supermarket.  You're coming in contact with fewer people.  I have a few friends that are still scared to leave the house.  But I'm so over coronavirus.</p>

<p>Exactly. For CA, we're out of this when there is a vaccine, herd immunity, or therapeutics/treatment. Why NO ONE is talking about the latter of the three is ridiculous, and could save everyone time.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm not sure. Newsom seems to have moved quicker on reopening, but there‚Äôs a thread in LockdownSkepticism about how Cuomo is threatening to shut down NYC again.</p>

        <p>Early on, in April,  Newsom said the only way out was herd immunity.  I knew he got it then.  But he backtracked hard.  He knows exactly what the situation and the lack of tax revenue should scare him to senses.  I actually respected his intelligence the day he said it.  I mean he actually said it.  Then of course backpedaled and said with a vaccine or therapeutics.  I think he will open up before other dem governors.</p>

        <p>Movie theatre by me in PA is opening Friday!  I can‚Äôt believe it.  But then there is this: https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/pennsylvania-sues-to-stop-car-show-over-crowd-size-even-after-gov-wolf-marched-in-protest-two-weeks-earlier/ar-BB15CEz8.</p>
<p>I peaked a look in my local bar on my last night and it was crowded!  No social distancing. Doors closed. Crowded.  But restaurants are empty.  Panera Bread today had 4 people.  It is so sad.</p>
<p>For fucks sake I live in a metro area and we have bears in our yards.  ‚ÄúANOTHER BEAR SPOTTED.‚Äù</p>
<p>https://www.wpxi.com/news/top-stories/another-bear-spotted-our-area-this-time-ross-township/6B6DVFEZQRDELFBBTWLEPLDNRI/</p>
<p>No pirate games,  Wolf won‚Äôt let us see steeler games, no chance at concerts, doubt we will have any conventions.  How about sitting on Santa‚Äôs lap for Christmas pics at the mall?  </p>
<p>I wish I could just disappear.  There isn‚Äôt even another place to go.  The whole world is shut down and i am now unemployed.  Argh.</p>
