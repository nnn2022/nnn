    <strong>"States are lifting mask mandates too soon! Cases are gonna go back up!" No, just no. Here's the facts:</strong>
    <p><p>2/3 of the country has either been vaccinated or has antibodies/tcell immunity. How did I get that number? ...</p>
<p>Just over 50% of the population is vaccinated. </p>
<p>35% of the unvaccinated population has already had covid. </p>
<p>That amounts to over 66% of the US population. </p>
<p>So that leaves less than 33% of the population that is still susceptible to covid. </p>
<p>Now when you consider that the percentage of seniors that have been vaccinated is much higher than the general population (75 or 80% last I checked), there is not really any bull case for covid deaths going back up. </p>
<p>Also, look at for instance, the all time NY state covid death chart. You will notice that the deaths due to the virus fell all throughout summer 2020 and nearly disappeared by the end of the summer. It wasn't until it started to get a little colder out in September that it started to come back up. </p>
<p>I bet in a month or so you'll see NY (my home state) and several other states basically will have no covid deaths and cases will be in the double digits trending down. By the end of the summer they will probably have a mass testing campaign to try to see if they can find any covid. </p>
<p>Maybe they'll find a case or two. Then covid will still spread next flu season but cases will be so low pretty much everywhere, that nobody will really care. (The media will still blow it out of proportion though. That's a given).</p>
<p>The other aspect of this is that, mathematically speaking, there is almost no scenario where hospitals would get overrun with covid cases going forward. </p>
<p>Therefore, anyone who is hospitalized with covid will get the best care. We have effective treatments for covid now. It's not like back a year ago when they'd throw you on a ventilator and cross their fingers. </p>
<p>WhAt AbOuT tHe VaRiAnTs? </p>
<p>None of them have been different enough to circumvent vaccination or naturally acquired immunity and I've seen no compelling evidence that it would even be possible for a whole new radically different variant to develop naturally. Show me the evidence.</p>
<p>If Covid and ebola have a baby together and that baby hooks up with the black death and aids baby, creating "black covbolaids", then I'll be concerned.</p>
<p>So anyway, figured I'd just again remind everyone that this is all but over. The pro covid shills will no longer have anything to rally behind soon and they will fade off into obscurity. Just keep living life and masking off and these loons will eventually cave.</p></p>

        <p>Long story:</p>
<p>When bars were opened back up last summer it was under the conditions that you had to be served food. You were not allowed to go in to a bar and just have a beer without having a food item placed in front of you. So bars started giving out "cuomo chips" </p>
<p>Then to make things more ridiculous, the governor put out an additional mandate that banned cuomo chips. You could still serve cuomo chips, but it would only qualify as an entree if it was served with a dip.</p>

        <p>And you had to wear a mask but only while standing. You could have the mask off while seated. Because everyone knows covid only spreads to people who aren't sitting down. </p>
<p>On top of that, live music was banned. But then he issued new guidance to say that "incidental music" was allowed. So it was essentially an acoustic mandate. But as part of the mandate as well, you were not allowed to do promoting for said music. It had to be secret mystery musicians that nobody was allowed to know about in advance. </p>
<p>"What band are you guys having play tomorrow night?" </p>
<p>"Sorry sir, it's classified. If I told you I would be breaking the law." </p>
<p>Another piece of ridiculous lockdown measures was the bar curfews. When everything first locked down, the bars were shut down for takeout only and could only serve food until 8pm. Then when bars were allowed to open back up with reduced capacity, cuomo chips, incidental music and mask mandates, they could only stay open until 10pm. Because everyone knows the virus goes to bed at 10pm, duh. </p>
<p>Then governor Homo said bars could be open until 11pm. Yippee! An extra hour! </p>
<p>As it stands right now bars can be open until midnight.  He's been giving us an extra hour of our freedoms back and acting as if it's an reward or something. When in reality he just does this every time he's under scrutiny by the media for something. </p>
<p>How did he get away with all of this bullshit? By leveraging his power through the state liquor authority (SLA). He had "contact tracers" on the state payroll, doing undercover sting operations. These people were literally getting paid to go eat burgers at different restaurants and find any place that was not in compliance with the long list of SLA guidelines. </p>
<p>Using the SLA extortion racket, the governor could issue hefty fines and strip businesses of their liquor licenses. You don't want to pay the fine? That's ok, we wont arrest you or even shut down your business, we'll just take away your liquor license and your business will die off on it's own.</p>

        <p>We've upped our takeout game over the past year and we have really good food so we've been doing ok. It was mostly bad for the waitresses and bartenders. Initially we did all we could to give them hours but it wasnt the same early on, since they make the most money off tips. I was raking in cash as a delivery driver though. I'd have 15-20 deliveries on a typical night and people in the community were tipping super generously. I would make $150-$200 in tips every 5 hour shift for like 3 months and even after that died down a bit the amount of deliveries we do is much higher than before covid. </p>
<p>That said, yeah i benefitted from it at first but I always thought it was silly and ridiculous. Theres no amount of $ i would take to justify never see my friends for the rest of my life and have to wear a breathing obstruction all day</p>

        <p>Even that wont work if almost everyone is vaccinated and/or immune to the virus. </p>
<p>A PCR "false positive" is basically just when somebody already recovered from the virus like a month or so before and tests positive because they have dead virus cells in their body that the test still picks up. </p>
<p>I've thought about the pcr test thing a lot and I've actually seen it first hand as someone I know was sick for a couple days, then a month in a half later had to take a test and came back positive. It was a false positive but technically adding his test to the "confirmed case count" is not dishonest, since he did have the virus, just not at the time he was tested. </p>
<p>Therefore the "confirmed cases" metric is more like a rolling 1 month average of cases, not a current case count. If they wanted to actually figure out how many people currently have the virus, they should lower the cycles. It would've been a lot easier to trace cases this way. But the way it stands, there will basically always be a spike if the amount of testing increases, which is where I think they are manipulating the data a bit. If they only do let's say 5,000 tests a day, then suddenly every college kid has to take a test to go back to school, and the number of tests goes up to 10,000 a day, obviously cases are going to spike. You have to look at the % of tests that come back positive to get any sense of whether or not there was an actual spike.</p>

        <p>Great argument but one small issue: there is overlap between those vaccinated and those who had COVID and we don't know how large that overlap is. Hopefully it's small so we are close to your number</p>

        <p>Which is why I multiplied by a percentage. The numbers check out I've done this calculation many times over. Sure, it might be off, but I couldn't imagine being off by more than 5% in either direction. </p>
<p>If anything I'd say that it's probably more than 2/3 because I imagine there are more unvaccinated people who have got the virus than vaccinated people who already had the virus.</p>
