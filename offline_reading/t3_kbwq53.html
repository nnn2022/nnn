    <strong>Getting out?</strong>
    <p><p>Here in Ontario the health minister has said vaccine proof will be mandatory to go into stores, theatres, restaurants...
I’m not vocal about not wanting this vaccine but I’m not taking it. No. Way. If other people want to it’s there prerogative. The more intense “they” get about it the more skeptical I’ve become. I’m not doing it.
Problem is my income is through government welfare. I feel a need to be prepared to get out, if necessary, though I don’t want to.
Is there anyone planning a mass meeting spot for shall we say free thinkers should things get too intense?
Is there anywhere safe to go even? Does anyone have plans of their own? I’m feeling drained. Idk what to do.</p></p>

<p>How are you tying this to OP's freedom?</p>
<p>Also how is it freedom to have to be a wageslave to someone to get money?</p>
<p>If the government creates money, forces you to use it just to survive, then at the very least, they owe every citizen money. </p>
<p>I swear some of you will STILL be bankster bitches even after this is all over.</p>

        <p>welfare is contractual... there are terms and conditions, to obtain welfare, one must 'apply' and 'qualify'</p>
<p>people in ~~public~~ government housing must follow any and all 'rules'...</p>
<p>one the rules of welfare (workfare) is you can't earn more than a certain amount of money or you lose the welfare...</p>
<p>&rt; Also how is it freedom to have to be a wageslave to someone to get money?</p>
<p>there are other ways to earn money, and it's possible to earn enough to 'break free' as i was able to achieve... F.I.R.E. pre lockdown</p>
<p>&rt; If the government creates money...</p>
<p>government doesn't 'create money', YOU are the money, or rather the collateral for the private scrip posing as 'money'. </p>

        <p>I agree with all that (I think) just don't tell me that we had a good system pre-2020. The bankers and the wealthy already had everything they ever wanted and more, withheld resources from the rest of us, and it SUCKED. Now they are coming for the endgame. So I literally don't give a shit at all if your life was great before 2020.</p>

        <p>Hmm I believe they just have had so much power for so long that they find it amusing to publish their plans. They find it funny to foist one belief on the masses only to foist the opposite belief months later, then back again. It really is embarrassing to see so many idiots hopelessly brainwashed and I don't blame the elites for looking down on the masses as stupid filth. However the elites are delusional because if they were truly smart and wise and intelligent they'd make better plans to get the good ones of us on their side. Instead they just take the pushovers and cogs because their plans are evil and they can't get good people to enact them.</p>
<p>The consent issue is interesting. They may still have some kind of belief in karma, or in a soul contract. Perhaps they believe they will not be judged if people 'willingly' follow their orders. So if they order someone to kill, then they believe they are exempt from that sin, because they didn't actually do it. But TBH I don't think it works that way. If you have power and refuse to use it for good, you will be judged badly. Doesn't matter if you do evil or not. So maybe they THINK consent is important for their salvation, but it isn't because it's either under duress, or they're still being evil by not being good. Perhaps there is some greater game in which consent gets them a prize.</p>
<p>Say it with me now: I DO NOT CONSENT</p>

<p>the cabal gets all  the 'good ones' they need that suit their purpose, house slaves are still slaves as are the visible overseeing political class</p>
<p>"In our dream, <em>we have limitless resources and the people yield themselves with perfect docility to our molding hand.</em> The present educational conventions fade from their minds; and, unhampered by tradition, we work our own good will upon a grateful and responsive rural folk. <strong>We shall not try to make these people or any of their children into philosophers or men of learning, or men of science. We have not to raise up from among them authors, editors, poets or men of letters.</strong> <strong><em>We shall not search for embryo great artists, painters, musicians nor lawyers, doctors, preachers, politicians, statesmen, of whom we have an ample supply</em></strong>…The task we set before ourselves is very simple as well as a very beautiful one, to train these people as we find them to a perfectly ideal life just where they are… So we will organize our children into a little community and teach them to do in a perfect way the things their fathers and mothers are doing in an imperfect way, in the homes, in the shops and on the farm." - cabal agent/operative frederick gates, 1913</p>

        <p>This makes sense in theory but is facile in the real world. Not sure of OP’s situation but if he or she is hooked on the govt dole, with no connections or career, then yeah, they are significantly more restricted and less free than a “wage slave,” who can at least take his ass to some other country and being a slave in a place that doesn’t require forced vaccines.</p>
<p>Like really? The OP says outright that being on welfare is a big part of the problem with trying to escape the insanity. </p>
<p>Yup: NO to socialism. No no no no. What the govt gives the govt can take away. And we will all be worse off for it.</p>

<p>Either way, you are on their dole, whether getting it through UBI, or round-about from a corporation, or by making a small business.</p>
<p>Money isn't water, or dirt. It is not from nature. It is a government product, a point system with arbitrary man-made rules.</p>

        <p>It’s not all the same. </p>
<p>OP has no way of making money outside the govt that oppresses him/her.</p>
<p>That isn’t true for everyone. </p>
<p>Like, good for you for understanding money is a nothing more than a concept. Props. Econ 101.</p>
<p>But UBI is a world away from earned income and this situation RIGHT HERE illustrates.</p>
<p>Strangle entrepreneurship, have people do the work YOU TELL THEM TO DO, while dangling UBI in front of them, as it comes with more and more strings. </p>
<p>The fact that pre 2020 was no walk in the park for the working man (which is true) doesn’t negate the fact that learning to rely on your government for financial survival is a bomb waiting to explode in your face.</p>
<p>Are you a NNN person or a brigader? Do you actually think the answer for government overreach like this, is having government control MORE of our lives - including the totality of financial lives? They’ll play us like a puppet.</p>
<p>We should be fighting for more entrepreneurial freedom, not fucking UBI. That you’d argue otherwise on THIS post is just a laugh riot.</p>

        <p>The OP isn't being controlled by CERB/EI payments (basically Canadian UBI at this point). That's what we're talking about.</p>

<p>I want more decentralized competing currencies.</p>
<p>Kneejerk reactions to UBI as an evil socialist plot aren't gonna fly with me tho. Usually only wealthy people who have easy lives and never had to struggle make those arguments. In my world if you want UBI go find a community that provides it. Let the best currencies win.</p>

        <p>The OP cannot make money without welfare. He or she cannot leave because of that. They are trapped and the govt can now demand she do whatever they say, or take the UBI away. That’s called being trapped. </p>
<p>I haven’t had an easy life by far - i grew up quite poor and struggled immensely, and I don’t think poverty is okay. And I’m still not wealthy. But I can earn money outside of a govt check. I can move if I need to and not have to ask permission.</p>
<p>I know people who want UBI REALLY want it, and we are just going round in circles because you can’t see that the same evil govt forcing vaccinations, making you have a covid pass, shutting sections of “national healthcare” down so that you can only have the healthcare they say you can... seeks to control the population at all costs. </p>
<p>So do you think think it’s okay for govt to require masks, build quarantine facilities (jails), force vaccinations? Because most people who want UBI also think Government Knowns Best and that all those things should be allowed. When the govt pays your allowance, they make every single rule because your well-being is their responsibility. It’s a parent-child relationship. </p>
<p>That’s not a knee jerk to UBI. It’s well reasoned and thought out. Not all arguments against your cause are “knee jerk” just because you disagree with them.</p>

        <p>You didn’t answer a single one of my questions.</p>
<p>I don’t have to provide a cohesive “solution” to argue that yours is worse than what we have in America. First, do no harm. </p>
<p>I think government control (even when it’s passed off as “care”) of citizens  is typically antithetical to human freedom, followed by big business control of citizens. Monopolies, collusion to suppress wages, multi national corporations paying so little that 90% of their workers are on govt aid, pollution and environmental degradation, actual slavery in developing countries and then hawking those wares at a 900% markup in developed countries...</p>
<p>I’d like govt to focus more of their attention on keeping enormous corporations in check and regulated, and on letting individuals, and small and medium sized companies thrive. I believe the stronger our independent small and medium business communities are, the freer and more prosperous our nation will be.</p>
<p>One of the BIGGEST proponents of UBI is giant corporations. Just like Walmart has their wage slaves getting healthcare on the taxpayers dimes via Medicaid because their wages are so low... UBI is the first step towards doing away with the minimum wage and worker protections. When work becomes optional, these corporations will argue that workers deserve less protections.</p>
