    <strong>There's a silver lining to the new normal a lot of people are overlooking...</strong>
    <p><p><strong>It's never been easier or more efficient to cut out lemmings and crazy lefties from your life.</strong> Putting on my tin-foil hat for a second but maybe we're looking at the psyop and brainwashing from the wrong perspective - it was meant to help people like us.</p>
<p>2020 in general - all of it - has been a godsend in some ways.</p>
<p>Wear a mask in public? Brainwashed by covid fear mongering? Actively fight people on social media about it? Cool, you just gave me a perfect reason to distance myself from you.</p>
<p>Constantly spamming social media with links to BLM charities I've never heard of before? Constantly going on about career felons as if they dindu nuffin? Unfollowed. Oh, you mean sports leagues and musicians are doing this too? Awesome, thanks for freeing up my Sunday.</p>
<p>Constantly spamming social media with infographics or other propaganda about LGBT/tranny rights? Genuinely think men with an open wound between their legs are women? See ya, hope the hearts on your tweets from strangers are worth it. Won't buy your product, won't hang out with you, GG EZ.</p>
<p>Jumping into facebook or twitter arguments with my friends and going full BPD freak-out about someone using "problematic language?" Cool, guess who's not getting invited to house parties anymore? Yep, it's you.</p>
<p>Advertising this weird as hell "beyond meat" junk as new menu items? Yep, guess who's not grabbing lunch from you guys anymore?</p>
<p>Start looking at the world through this lens. It's glorious.</p></p>

        <p>The NPC meme is real and a huge portion of the population do nothing but go to work, come home, and numb themselves watching TV. The sooner you accept this reality the better.</p>
<p>It might suck to lose friends but a small group of close-knit friends who think freely is a lot more rewarding than a giant group of NPC's who barely tolerate each other and just babble on about The Office reruns.</p>

        <p>Couldn't agree more. I just recently cut a group of friends out that have had the same overreaction to the scamdemic THE ENTIRE TIME. I tried to drop them breadcrumbs over the past few months and they have not budged an inch the entire time. If you are such a simpleton that you don't see the fact that governments around the world are using this event to further their wishlists, you are just lost to me. Goodbye!</p>

        <p>But they don't get it. Some do, most don't. They're absolutely clueless as to why we think this way and why anyone would ever possibly be upset. Yeah, it ultra petty to even say this but cutting them off doesn't feel as good when they don't even understand why. At that rate it just feels mean and pathetic.</p>

        <p>It's like talking to an automata sometimes, reminds me of something I saw Jordan Peterson said when talking about an interview; he wanted to talk with a person and not an ideology.<br>
The ability to entertain an opposing viewpoint, acknowledge it and not just throw it out is vital in communication. It's really vital when talking to actual conspiracy theorists, that is those who jump way down rabbit holes, as you can see the clicking of ideas and dopamine rushes they experience and their reluctance to alter views because of it. Comparing said behaviour to those who can't entertain another view especially around covid or even politics in general is startling in terms of the similarities.</p>

        <p>Two things need to happen here that aren't.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li>They need to be willing to discuss the issues without getting overly emotional or resorting to ad hominem or other fallacies.</li>
<li>They need to use facts and statistics from peer reviewed sources.</li>
</ol>
<p>If these things happen, and their facts support their side more than it supports mine, I change my mind. I am a thinking being that understands that I am likely wrong on many things without even realizing it. I try to actively seek out an prove myself wrong for that exact reason, because I prefer an uncomfortable truth to a convenient lie.</p>

        <p>the vast majority of assholes in society are enthusiastic supporters of violations of human rights and civil liberties. this plandemic was just more evidence of that fact.</p>
<p>the vast majority of assholes give no fucks about freedom and bodily autonomy. the vast majority of assholes are a ok with government violating human rights, civil liberties, self ownership and personal freedom. the vast majority of assholes would more than happily  torture people to death if the nanny state and/or its oligarch owners told them to do so. i dont see people as people anymore. i see them as enemies of liberty and future willing participants of authority led crimes against humanity</p>
<p>this plandemic has made me even more misanthropic. ive reached levels of misanthropy i never thought were possible. im straight up intolerant of everyone on planet earth. ive lost all empathy and compassion for assholes because they clearly dont deserve it. this entire species needs to go extinct. since homo sapiens cannot respect liberty and continuously violate personal freedom, they do not deserve to exist.</p>

        <p>This. It has been known, possibly forever, that when you give a regular person power, they abuse it worse than the Kim dynasty. There people reflexively support crimes against humanity as objective, unquestionable goods, and then call themselves as ultimately caring and morally superior. </p>
<p>It's pure ego, pure delusion, and a sense of moral superiority that comes without reading a single paragraph on moral philosophy.</p>

        <p>I can't believe how many people I have to tell it's not ok to kill children because you don't want to provide for them or be bothered.  It just gets surreal.  I'll be talking about why abortion is murder, and they'll ask who would care for all these kids.  Seriously. How is this a conversation?  (And that was my husband's best friend from college,  not some random weirdo.)</p>
<p>Or I'll say that life begins at conception, it's science and...  Suddenly, no they don't believe in that science. </p>
<p>Or how about those human traffickers who bring their sex slaves to Planned Parenthood because they don't ask questions?  Nope,  don't care.</p>
<p>I tell them I don't want to take a vaccine tainted by abortion,  (both options were tested on cells from an aborted infant) they tell me, oh, do you really believe everything in the Bible... Just wow.  That's religious persecution,  but that's ok because I'm a Christian. Yeah, tell Jesus at your final judgment that you're ok with killing the most vulnerable and innocent amongst us at genocide levels and see how well that goes.</p>
<p>They say "My body, My choice" when that preborn child is not their body, but...  if you say that about the vaccine,  you're the murderer.</p>

        <p>Great points! I don’t see how people cannot see through the BS narrative that does not match the CDC and WHO data... then I remember that so many people only get news from legacy media and YouTube lol.</p>
<p>For the first few months of this, I was all into believing the hype. I really thought the death rate was around 3-5% for <em>everyone</em>, and was absolutely terrified. Then around the time the rioting and burning cities — err,  “mostly peaceful protests” started — and the media and politicians did a 180 and literally said “well that’s different”, it became immediately clear just how “serious” the CCP virus actually is.</p>

        <p>actually its just as good  for exposing crazy self centred right wingers. The virus is pretty much bi partisan. You're conflating anti lockdown sentiment with a political position. I would rather not paint myself into a proverbial corner.  Its not that I am overlooking this silver lining but the crazies on either wing weren't appealing before and no better now.  Its not where most people are either, being in the messy middle with a wide variety of beliefs that resist being pigeon holed or polarised onto one wing or the other. The world isn't black and white. Tbh they are just as likely to be glad to be rid of you as well.  Thanks for showing us you're true colours.</p>

        <p>Yeah the crazy right and crazy left are a bit concerning, but you can't possibly buy the bullshit that the right is self-centered because they want freedom, while the left are puritans who want everyone to be safe if it means locking down to poverty and government dependence. Selfishness comes in different ways, gotta admit.</p>
