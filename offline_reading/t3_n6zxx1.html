    <strong>Question about statistics</strong>
    <p><p>So I've been a big background reader the past year but just recently started looking at statistics. By my calculations of recovered cases by my age group the fatality rate for 30 to 39 year olds is something like .0018 percent am I reading this correct? Like if so I'm dumbfounded. I got the covid death number from age group and sex from the cdc website.</p></p>

        <p>Do you mean that the fatality rate is 0.0018%? Because if you do, then you now understand now why no-one should be forced to participate in a gene therapy experiment that they have been ignorantly fear-mongered into thinking is necessary. What a completely benevolent white lie, right?</p>

        <p>I mean I don't trust any msm left or right for the past 10 years or so but like seriously after seeing people post these numbers after the last month or two I started looking into it more. Even for older individuals which granted is higher. Its still relatively low compared to what will be killing us all in that age bracket correct? Ex. Heart disease cancer stroke.</p>

        <p>Yeah the numbers are stupidly low. The entire world went into a shut down over a slightly worse flu. That's all it's ever been. And I was one of those people that thought this would actually be a big deal. And it is, but not for the reasons I expected.</p>

        <p>Cant tell you if your number is right, would need to see your data.</p>
<p>Generally speaking tho, check worldometer:</p>
<p>157,000,000 cases, 3,300,000 deaths, thats a case-fatality-rate slightly higher than 2%.</p>
<p>However, this only counts for reported cases without any consideration for dark-figures. As Corona is highly assymptomatic, you can guess that there were a lot more cases. While I also heard stories about death-dark-figure, its gonna be a diminishing number in comparison to cases, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>So, I heard different figures for dark-figure, there were peer-reviewed-meta-studies published by the WHO claiming iirc a dark-figure of factor 11. Meaning, there were not only 157 Million cases, but 1,727 Billion.</p>
<p>If that figure is correct, the Total-case-fatality rate would be roughly 0.19%. Now if you keep in mind that most of the deaths are contributed to elder people, but have a somewhat equal spread in cases, then your number could very well be correct.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It makes me very sad that it doesnt even need any kind of study, virologistic expertise, epidemiologic knowledge, or higher mathematics.... you can easily debunk the hype with 6th grade math. :(</p>

        <p>Another stat...the CDC lower the death rate of...just from covid-19 to 5% down from 6%. That means out of the 594,000 deaths less than 30,000 were from just covid..... 30,000 deaths....and we are shooting the fuck out of people with who knows what for 30,000... everyone else has 2 or more comorbidities or elderly... And minus the ones the governor's killed in nursing homes with their backassward policies you have to ask yourself what the fuck are we actually doing!</p>
