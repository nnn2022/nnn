    <strong>[Quebec] It's been one fucking year and we're more restricted than ever</strong>
    <p><p>I can't take this shit anymore. </p>
<p>The ~~government~~ fucking psychopaths in charge just mandated masks OUTSIDE if you do a physical activity (including walking) with someone who doesn't live with you. </p>
<p>Also, everyone now needs to wear a mask and goggles while working, even if you are alone in an office with the door closed. </p>
<p>The cases are rising bEcAusE oF tHe vAriAnts (actually because they test at 45 cycles of amplification but that's just a fucking conspiracy theory apparently even if the labs that do the tests have confirmed it) but we have less deaths than we've ever had and the hospitalisations are dropping down faster than my will to live.  Everyone who's 80+ has been vaccinated and now they're vaccinating the 60+. Everyone else literally has NO FUCKING CHANCE to die from this glorified flu. </p>
<p>This is never going to end. It's so fucking obvious that soon enough the "experts" will find a variant that resists the vaccine and we will go back to square 0 (because we've barely left square one after more than a year). It will most likely happen in October when the new strain of influenza is gonna show up and it's all going to be counted as Covid, again. </p>
<p>This is never going to end. Everyone is going along with this like everything makes sense. HOW DO THEY NOT SEE ALL THE CONTRADICTIONS?! WHY?!?!</p></p>

        <p>I know, it’s such bullshit. And the whole “the variants affects young people more” line is even worse. Funny coincidence how this new and improved COVID affects those most likely to disobey curfew laws</p>

        <p>Right there with you brother...</p>
<p>I just can't believe the amount of people here in Quebec that literally ask for more restrictions and are happy with it.</p>
<p>Also, so many just don't give a fly about anything that won't concern them. I already see people like that asking and applauding the coming of the vaccine passport. Why would they care, they gladly take the shot, so everyone should do it, "and I'm glad they suffer if they don't dare do the same as I did".</p>
<p>I'm just so damn tired of the dumbness...</p>
<p>They are too damn ignorant to realize how ignorant they are, but they are fucking convinced that they are the brightest star in the sky.</p>

        <p>For me it seems a little bit to good to be true, it's like the perfect conspiracy theorist bait. But these days you'll never know, as the "conspiracy theorists" have been right more often in the last year than the "experts". </p>
<p>As for my family and friends, I don't know because all of them watch mainstream media or they just don't stay informed at all except through hearsay. </p>
<p>I don't think it would be productive to parade that document around as some kind of evidence because it's quite extreme and there are a lot of inconsistencies closer to people that can be pointed out first, such as the alleged eradication of the flu and the common, which makes absolutely no sense at all. </p>
<p>The moment I truly realized the emperor wore no clothes was when the Director of public health in Quebec said in a press conference that "there is no flu at all this year so if you have flu symptoms go get tested because it's Covid". I've been alive 28 years and I've had a flu and a cold every year for as long as I can remember. There is no way in hell I will believe that the flu magically disappeared in 2020. And in case some doomer lurker reads this and says "it's because of masks and social distancing, it's just that Covid is more infectious", let me remind you that we've been told all year long that the rise in cases was caused by people violating the rules by meeting at home so please explain how they spread just Covid and never the flu and the cold. </p>
<p>The amount of bullshit you have to believe in order to claim that the flu and the cold disappear is astronomical compared to believing that they are counting flu and cold cases as covid cases. So that to me, is the most obvious thing that doesn't add up. You can pile on to that  all the times the "experts" contradicted themselves this year and you've got a pretty good argument to convince people that are not fully brainwashed that, at the very least, the government is incompetent and should not be listened to when it comes to your health.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I agree with you for the most part.</p>
<p>The "bait" as you refer to it... It's been accurate enough that it's still alarming to me, though. I mean come on, Trudeau's quarantine centers? And... the insane lockdowns that so many countries are enduring? None of it makes sense!</p>
<p>One thing I've noticed is basic negotiation stuff -- scare people with something really extreme. Then dial back and only go 65-75% as far as you threatened... Then people will be relieved that you didn't go all the way.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wonder if that's what that document was about. Go a little too far fetched so that when it's 75% accurate, people go, "Whew, at least they didn't do that last part!" --- but even 75% is extreme!</p>
<p>Kind of like... If you want a 5k raise you better ask for 10k. You leave room for compromise. If you ask for 5, you'll get 2.</p>
<p>And the flu disappearing. Yeah. It's so obvious someone would have to be incredibly naive to think otherwise... But sure enough - people will believe anything on the news at this point.</p>

        <p>The EU Courts just declared that Mandatory Vaccines are a necessity to democracy. Legault and Trudeau are on the same page and you will be forced to take the vaccines and carry your Vaccination Passports soon. </p>
<p>And I suggest you watch <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lFmv_z040HI">The IMF creates a secret money layer. </a></p>
<p>The IMF is going to bring in a new monetary system that will print trillions of SDR’s which they will give to Countries that do as they are told. This is part of the Reset. </p>
<p>If you ever wondered why the Liberals are spending with abandon, this is why. Good Luck.</p>

        <p>Its the precedent that matters. Now if anyone takes the EU to court over mandatory vaccines the EU will have a precedent that says the Government has the right to choose for the individual. </p>
<p>There is no doubt in my mind that the EU Courts chose this case to hear because they want to push mandatory vaccines and vaccine passports onto the entire European Union.</p>

        <p>I wonder what's gonna happen to Florida, Texas and other states that are back to normal now. Maybe it's over for them because the people still have guns to defend themselves? Will we see an influx of mass shootings in these places along with 24/7 news coverage to push for gun control and eventually gun confiscation?</p>

        <p>Honnêtement est-ce que c'est arrivé une fois qu'une manifestation à changé quelque chose depuis l'année dernière? Ça donne quoi de manifester contre le gouvernement en respectant les règles du government sur comment on a le droit de manifester?</p>
<p>Mettons qu'il y aurait une manif après le couvre-feu ou absolument personne porte un masque pour forcer la Gestapo a donner des tickets à tout le monde (et on s'entend, si c'est juste genre 100 personnes, c'est useless) peut être que ça vaudrait la peine.   </p>
<p>On est rendu au point où le seul moyen de résister c'est la désobéissance civile. Mais pour ça il faut être prêt à sacrifier son comfort. Mais imagine genre 5000 personnes qui défoncent les portes de l'assemblée nationale à 22h pour faire un sit-in... Man juste a y penser j'ai des frissons. Pi après ça voir les réactions des boomers qui aime Mononc' Legault sur Facebook lol Osti que ça me redonnerait la fierté d'être québécois ça!</p>

        <p>Ugh I'm so sorry. That sounds awful. They are slowly lifting restrictions here in AC (although obviously never returning to normal...) but I wouldn't put it past them to reverse if we get 10 extra cases and can totally picture mask mandates for outside (so many fucking people walking around with masks on outside in this tiny fucking province it's ridiculous)</p>

        <p>Honestly, I day-dream about moving to a free state in the US, fly the Gadsden flag on my porch and never worry about a thing in the world anymore.</p>
<p>But I don't think my fiancée would go along with me as her tactic is pretty much living in denial of what's going on and trusting that everyone in charge is acting in good faith. I don't think my family would support me. I would have to throw my entire life away and start anew. I don't thing I have the balls to do that right now... I feel so fucking demoralized. Like I just went through a year long and still ongoing psyop. Oh wait that's exactly what happened.</p>
<p>I wonder if I have a breaking point and what that will be. At which point exactly will the attacks on my freedoms and my integrity will outweigh my perceived comfort? By the time I realize that, will it be too late to act?</p>
