    <strong>"Wearing a mask is just a minor inconvenience"</strong>
    <p><p>No. It's a major inconvenience and I'll explain why.</p>
<p>The wearing of masks out in public is a probability game. The mandatory mask policy assumes that there's a possibility you may be infected with coronavirus and be totally unaware, and then spread it even though you're asymptomatic. First of all, that "fact" of asymptomatic spread alone is highly disputed and it makes up the pillar of this policy. So if you take that assumption away then mandatory mask wearing becomes POINTLESS. People would only need to wear a mask if they're presenting symptoms, of which only they could be the true judge of.</p>
<p>But whatever. Let's just say for the sake of argument that asymptomatic spread is possible. We have no clue at what rate this occurs. You're telling everyone (in a shit hole state like CA) that they need to wear a mask whenever they're at work or in the public from now on. So over the course of a year that's 40 hours a week while working combined with at least another 10 hours a week while out in public (shopping, gym, church, etc). So it's an easy 50 hours a week. Over the course of a year that's 2,600 hours of wearing a fucking face diaper over my face and you say it's a "minor inconvenience"? Fuck you.</p>
<p>This is a total overreach of authority to force people to do this. And it's all on the off chance that you MIGHT have coronavirus, that you MIGHT spread it despite being asymptomatic, and that you MIGHT spread it to someone who is not the 99% that will be totally fine.</p>
<p>Now, just to show that I'm actually a fairly reasonable person when my freedom of choice isn't being trampled on by authoritarian fuckheads, there are certain circumstances where even I would wear a mask. If I was visiting my elderly grandmother while she was in a convalescent home, I would mask up during our visit to be safe. That actually makes sense because it's a short amount of time wearing it and it's in direct contact with someone who could be badly affected by the virus. But this 2,600 hours a year bullshit is going way too far and it's much more than a "minor inconvenience".</p>
<p>Anyone telling you otherwise is gaslighting the fuck out of you.</p></p>

        <p>They didn’t care during SARS, H1N1, or any past flu season. The science hasn’t changed, all the mask studies that show effectiveness are old and have been around for years. Why start masking up now? Propaganda is a hell of a drug ESPECIALLY today with 24/7 screens in everyone’s face.</p>

        <p>Anyone who has said "it's just an minor inconvenience" has never been forced to wear an N95 for 16 working hours a day. I've worked in healthcare for almost a decade and no one ever cared before about what virus or bacteria they might be spreading around, but now there's a 0.001% chance I <em>might</em> spread the flu I have to nearly suffocate all day. </p>
<p>I assume those who say things like this either WFH and go shopping for 30 minutes a week or are just look for approval/their daily dopamine hit on social media.</p>

        <p>This right here. Correctly worn fresh N95 is no joke. I wore it doing grocery shopping for people like the first month of this shit and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. One time I moved too quick lifting stuff after first putting it on and had chest pains.</p>

        <p>I appreciate the sentiment but if you lived in a shit hole state like CA your life would be a living hell if you didn't mask up while working or in public stores. You would lose your job, you would be publicly filmed and castigated, and the store clerks would refuse to check you out. I'm only telling you this to encourage you to appreciate the freedom you have to make that choice, because it can (and possibly will) be taken from you at some point in time and then you'll have to decide what you're willing to sacrifice in order to hold that position.</p>

        <p>I can relate. I live in MA, which is a lot like CA in many ways both legally and demographically. There are only a few small stores that are cool and will let you go in with no mask, and only “out in the sticks”. Any big retailer requires it and usually hand out masks to those who don’t have them. I do make an effort to always walk up to the door maskless and as soon as I’m exiting I pull it down, I usually wear a gaiter for convenience. Our governor mandated masks to be worn outside, and that’s the one place I feel they can’t control, so I do not comply. I’ve walked by cops and they haven’t said anything to me so far. As much as I don’t really like them, I think a lot of them are on our side on this issue at least.</p>
<p>Early on, back in the spring to summer I was wearing a skull bandana or a shemagh to try and make people uncomfortable and start to question the whole mask thing but it doesn’t work all that much (but the shemagh worn as a “terrorist” head wrap gets some looks). It was way too hot in the summer time though. I just decided to buy a plague doctor mask that I plan on wearing to the store, to go full-on let’s be ridiculous mode. Bought a decent looking one off Etsy. People are already afraid, so why not give them what they want. My hope is it makes people question how stupid this all is. Maybe I’ll have to go full in character and talk about the “dirty air” and pestilence about. </p>
<p>I’m just glad there are other people out there we can all rant and talk to about this craziness. This sub is one of the places that has kept me going.</p>

        <p>I live in MA too. The police in my town don't care either, and have had to tell people not to call them if they see someone without a mask on. They also have said that if someone calls 911 about it they will not respond to the call. Even more recently they've had to tell people to not confront someone for not wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>I’m glad to hear that, it gives me some hope. That’s the thing, it’s the city folk who are batshit crazy. I’m glad some of the towns are fairly normal, but boy do I know a lot of these crazy people.</p>

        <p>Also - what virus in history has been SO transmissible that it requires constant masking even if you've never experienced any symptoms and is so capable of defeating your immune system that your immune system is never able to enact a defense that protects you and others? Nope!  Even after almost a year you're still just as infectious and just as much a silent spreader as when this all 'began'.</p>
<p>Then you've got that pesky PCR test that will either produce a completely false positive due to the way it's being misused or a cold positive from having some exposure to the virus up to months before but currently you have no infection whatsoever.  Still, public health will tell you you're covid positive and begin contact tracing and this whole process will repeat over and over.</p>

        <p>I've had a sore throat for months because I have to wear a mask 40 hours a week for work, and I'm very grateful that I have been able to keep working this whole time, but it pretty much went away when I had to quarantine for a week and half and didn't wear a mask...I also had bad headaches at the beginning, but I guess I've adapted to the lack of oxygen. It's not a minor inconvenience. No one hears me talk, when I say hello to people, they often just look at me as if it's an affront. </p>
<p>It makes me so sad every time I see a child wearing a mask. They are being robbed of their childhood innocence.</p>

        <p>It's also "mostly symbolic" don't forget. Maybe people need to ask themselves what it is supposed to symbolize. See, people assume they are on the same page with the people in charge. It's kind of like when Obama said he wanted "change". People assumed that meant change that was good for the average American. Read between the lines people! They are telling you what they are doing but you are giving them the benefit of the doubt that they don't deserve.</p>

        <p>Various quality RCT studies have shown that universal masking has no effect as a source control in viral epidemics. Most people have the illusion that the mask prevents the spread. Hence, these delusional people go to public places while symptomatically ill and efficiently spread the disease.</p>
