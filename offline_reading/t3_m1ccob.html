        <p>“Opre said it is her understanding that students whose parents do not call to excuse them prior to participating in the walkout will be considered an unexcused absence and will not be allowed to make up missed assignments or participate in after-school activities that day, which, she said, could have lasting repercussions and believes it is an attack on First Amendment rights.”</p>
<p>Could be an attendance issue. If they make it till that time, parents don’t have to call.</p>

        <p>Isn’t the whole point of a protest to be disruptive? Who cares about attendance or asking permission? This is lame.</p>

        <p>As I’d like to agree with you, read the last part of the quote... if a 16 yr old kid wants to walk out, and he misses an important test that the school can deem as essential for passing... what decision do you have?</p>

        <p>Again, I’d like to agree with you. But I think some 16yr olds might just wear the mask till 2:30 if they get a threat that have to get held back a year. </p>
<p>Worked for me when I was that age. 17 years old. Good ol’ “senior skip week” 2 weeks left of school, we all “agreed” to just skip the last week, not show up. We were seniors. What were they gonna do? Cant give us detention. We were done!<br>
Well, they said that if we skipped, we couldn’t walk to get our diploma, which means we would have to do summer school. Looking back at it now, it was all empty threats and I’m sure they wouldn’t do shit, but every single one of us were on time the rest of the school year.</p>

        <p>They told us if too many people skipped on "senior skip day" that they would cancel our senior banquet. </p>
<p>Senior skip day was the friday before memorial day, traditionally skipped by many, including faculty. We skipped, they called our bluff. We had the senior banquet anyway. It was a private event, paid for out of pocket,  and the class set the invitations. About 1/3 of the faculty were invited. The rest, including the principal, superintendent, and some department heads that were not well liked, did not. </p>
<p>To this day, our class still has money in its account that was supposed to be spent on that banquet. To this day, the principal is still a colossal weenie. He's moved form district to district causing all sorts of issues everywhere he went.</p>
