        <p>This is the correct response☝️☝️☝️ Masking young children is child abuse. There is no other way to put it. </p>
<p>Straight from the WHO and UNICEF: </p>
<p>“Children aged 5 years and under should not be required to wear masks. This is based on the safety and overall interest of the child and the capacity to appropriately use a mask.”</p>

<p>it's abusive for adults, as well as dehumanizing and degrading.</p>

        <p>&rt;Maybe United should reconsider its age requirements</p>
<p>Well considering small children are the least likely demographic to contract and also die from this virus, I'd say so.</p>
<p>&rt;Would you rather this potentially COVID positive kid killed the old lady in front or behind them?</p>
<p>This entire virus is built on "potentially"s - "Well, there kinda sorta maybe a chance that someone could catch it and then possibly be harmed by it." There's also the potential for the plane to be hijacked by terrorists. There's also the potential for the plane to break down and crash into a city. We live with risk every single day of our lives. You have a wayyy higher chance of being killed by so many other things than this virus. I'd say if you're willing to get on an enclosed plane with dozens upon dozens of others for any period of time, you clearly aren't <em>that</em> afraid of this virus or being harmed from it, or else you wouldn't dare even think about stepping foot on that plane. If someone is that terrified of this very weak virus, they should stay home. It's easier than ever to do so.</p>
<p>&rt;United did the right thing.</p>
<p>Personally, I think that United did the right thing as well. But that's because I can guarantee that most companies, United included, are taking all these precautionary measures so they don't lose massive business because of one thing or another. Also, so they can shout about how safe and sanitary they are because they just care soooo much about others. Plus, if they didn't take extreme measures, they would get smeared relentlessly by the media - especially if even one person was found out to have the virus while being on a flight.</p>

        <p>Why is the old lady in front or behind the kid flying at all? If she doesn’t want to risk getting this and dying, it’s up to her to stay home. The minute she goes out it’s her responsibility and it’s on her if she gets covid. </p>
<p>Has this person ever wondered how many people they’ve killed with the flu before? They spread it and around it goes until grandma dies. It happens all the time but hasn’t been an issue before. </p>
<p>Also please tell me how it’s remotely safe to mask a child that young. A two year old doesn’t have the capability to think through and tell you “mom I am having difficulty breathing so this mask needs to come off”. They don’t think “oh no I’m going to pass out so I need to take this mask off”. You put it on them and they have no way to equate any difficulties they may have to the mask, so they may not take it off if it’s risking their health. It’s not like an adult who would go “I am having difficulty breathing, I need to take my mask off for a few minutes”. Kids that young can’t reason through that and make the connection, and they don’t always know when something is a threat to their own health, it’s dangerous as hell to put a mask on them.</p>
