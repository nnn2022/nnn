    <strong>PETER HITCHENS: “Protest against our new State of Fear is banned... by order of a Dead Parrot Parliament“</strong>

<p>“We have ceased to be a parliamentary democracy. There was no military putsch. Nobody passed an Enabling Act allowing rule by decree. </p>
<p>But the House of Lords and the House of Commons are now the Dead Parrot Parliament.</p>
<p>They are dead because they do nothing to hold the Government to account. </p>
<p><strong>The most shocking instance of this so far was the £10,000 fine imposed on the eccentric weather forecaster Piers Corbyn (brother of Jeremy) for his part in organising a protest in London</strong></p>
<p>They are parrots because, when asked, they obediently confirm decrees Downing Street put into effect, sometimes weeks before. </p>
<p>We used to jeer that the so-called parliaments of Communist and Fascist states were mere rubber stamps. Well, we cannot jeer now...</p>
<p>The regulation used to fine Mr Corbyn – 5b of the Coronavirus Act – ‘was hastily made law the day before the demonstration was held. </p>
<p>It was introduced under an emergency procedure and was neither debated nor given even the most cursory scrutiny by any parliamentary process.</p>
<p>‘It permits the most junior Community Support Officer in the country to issue a Fixed Penalty Notice to the suspected organiser of a political event, demanding £10,000 to avoid prosecution and consequent financial ruin.”</p></p>
