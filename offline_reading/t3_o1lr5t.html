    <strong>How to TERRIFY SMALL CHILDREN into being Covaxxed, Canada-style</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/covid-19-wildfire-kashechewan-1.6067874">https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/covid-19-wildfire-kashechewan-1.6067874</a></p>
<p>It's all here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Inflammatory, terrifying language</li>
<li>Paternalistic attitude towards First Nations/Native people</li>
<li>Distortion, misrepresentation, and omission of key information</li>
</ol>
<p>(NOTE: I am not an anti-vaxxer. I have gotten the Covid vaccine, myself, based on my judgement of my risk. What is infuriatingly disturbing to me about this article is the relentless narrative that every single person MUST submit to the vaccine, even those at virtually zero risk of getting seriously ill or dying from SARS-CoV2.)</p>
<p>Reading this article you might be led to think that Native children are dying in droves. Actually, what is happening is that children under 12 in this northern community are getting infected because they are the group that hasn't been vaccinated. Anyone with even a casual acquaintance with the statistics knows that the risk of death to people under 12, under 20, under 30 is extremely low.</p>
<p>&rt;Miller said children and adolescents make up a "majority" of those infections because vaccines are currently limited to those 12 years of age and older</p>
<p>The not-so-subtle message in this article is:  "EVERYONE SINGLE PERSON, INCLUDING EVERY SMALL CHILD, NO MATTER IF THEY'VE ALREADY HAD COVID-19, MUST BE VACCINATED."</p>
<p><strong>Please note what the CBC DOESN'T tell you</strong>. There is ZERO information in this article about whether children are actually getting ill. It just says that they have been infected. Older people in the community at higher risk have already been vaccinated.</p>
<p>WE HAVE REACHED THE NADIR. THE END OF BALANCED, CRITICAL JOURNALISM. The major media outlets in Canada, with the rarest of exceptions, just print whatever the political elite tells them to print.</p></p>
