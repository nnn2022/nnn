    <strong>Abusing ambiguous language to create fear</strong>
    <p><p>Earlier this morning, inspired by a  post on /r/LockdownSkepticism, I re-read George Orwell's essay <a href="https://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit">Politics and the English language.</a>  One of Orwell's points in that essay is that words are often used ambiguously; they trick people into believing they're thinking the same thing when they're actually thinking completely different things.</p>
<p>The word "pandemic" comes to mind. I think pandemic is actually an ambiguous/tricky term as envisioned by Orwell, because it conjures up this image of a highly deadly disease spreading globally. Actually though the technical definition does not include the word "deadly"...</p>
<p>Pandemic -  Epidemic over a wide geographic area and affecting a large proportion of the population.</p>
<p>Epidemic -  An outbreak of a contagious disease that spreads rapidly and widely.</p>
<p>Covid really is an epidemic; it really is a pandemic, but those words carry with them an unjustified sense of threat/danger. People hear the word "pandemic" and assume that massive danger is implicit in the term. It isn't.  Covid is not that dangerous, and those words create a reactionary fear in the general populace that is not justified.</p>
<p>We know that about 1.7 million people have died form covid globally this year. We also know that the expected total number of deaths this year, all being completely normal in the world, would be about 60 million. </p>
<p>It seems to me that in order to be a genuinely dangerous pandemic, the total death counts would need to be considered in proportion with the total amount of expected annual deaths. To justify large-scale infringements of liberty, one would need to see a disease that had the potential to kill several multiples of the expected annual death figures, and not just the people who were going to die anyway. (I'm being deliberately vague - I don't know exactly where I'd put the figure, but my point is it needs to be thought of as units of 60 million. 1.7million on this scale is not particularly impressive).</p>
<p>All of which is to say: Covid certainly qualifies as a pandemic, but if you're having conversations about it with doomers, it might be worth making it clear that that word might not mean what they think it means.</p></p>
