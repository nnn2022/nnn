        <p>This is infuriating. How could anyone read something like this and come away supporting lockdowns? We locked down to protect vulnerable demographics (elderly and chronically ill). Instead, government policy has put them straight into hospital (which also increases their risk of the virus we're trying to keep away from them!) </p>
<p>It's not just a few people, either. Think of how many people live alone and have nobody to take them to hospital. Think of how many people have had their social networks and/or healthcare team taken away from them - there's nobody to raise the alarm if they're worried something's happened.</p>
<p>Lift the lockdowns - don't kill grandma!</p>

        <p>This is heartbreaking. The comments give me hope that humanity is not entirely gone yet- lotâ€™s of people seem to care. I wonder if m this virus has become an excuse to kill off the old people for depopulation reasons.</p>

        <p>I feel like there are more chances of an elderly dying from the "prevention measures" than corona itself. Elderly are not like normal adults. They get confused and all. They are fragile and their emotions play a big role in recovery. I didn't do research but staying in bed all the time and not being happy weakens the immune system significantly.</p>

        <p>my grandma is really old and used to go for a short daily walk. She is slowly getting some dementia (she's done really well for her age) and the Covid fear has made her stop taking a walk by herself. You know how you can't convince seniors of anything past a certain age? Well there's no point in trying to gently tell her it's safe and she should not give up something she liked to do.</p>
<p>I am enraged that they did this to her.</p>
<p>The fuckers have ruined lives, far more lives than would ever have been at risk. Sometimes you have to make tough decisions in life and this is one where spineless weak  and semi-corrupt governments (that is, they listen to lobbyists and interest groups, not "the citizenry") just caved to fear. Among other things.</p>
