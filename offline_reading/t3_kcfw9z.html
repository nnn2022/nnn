    <strong>Volvo Creepy Ads on Reddit</strong>
    <p><p>We've probably all seen the Volvo Advertisement here on Reddit about seat belts.</p>
<p>I had a feeling something was wrong b/c it's such a dramatic commercial, so I clicked on the link to Volvo so see the rest of the ad. </p>
<p>Volvo has big plans for the future, including "geo-fencing" to automatically throttle your engine so that a driver cannot speed in restricted areas like schools.</p>
<p>An AI powered driver monitoring program to detect drunk or distracted driving.</p>
<p>It all fits into the Great Reset, selling us reduced freedoms for the sake of our own protections.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.volvocars.com/us/v/car-safety/a-million-more?sourceapplicationinformation=us_rng_awr_npl&amp;dclid=CK2UprPIy-0CFUhGfgodUIoCfw">https://www.volvocars.com/us/v/car-safety/a-million-more?sourceapplicationinformation=us_rng_awr_npl&amp;dclid=CK2UprPIy-0CFUhGfgodUIoCfw</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>To send a strong signal about the dangers of speeding, we reduced the top speed of all our new cars to 112 mph in 2020. We are also looking at how smart speed control and geofencing technology could automatically limit speeds near schools and hospitals in the future.</p>
<p><em>Highway pilot</em></p>
<p>With support from LiDAR sensors, the next generation of Volvo cars will be hardware-ready for autonomous drive. And over time, we will push out over-the-air software updates to provide fully autonomous highway driving.</p>
<p><em>Driver monitoring cameras</em></p>
<p>To help address intoxication and distraction in traffic, we are working on new in-car solutions. Driver monitoring cameras, together with other sensors, will allow the car to intervene when a clearly intoxicated or distracted driver risks serious injury or death.</p></p>

        <p>Our last hope died when WWII veterans passed fighting age. History is cyclical in allowing these outbursts of freedom after big wars (when elites couldn't hold back the tide if they wanted to...) which close as the war recedes from memory. Because of concentration of technology, this might be the deepest sump of anti-freedom in the history of humanity; today's tyrants have psychiatry, satellites, and DNA reform. But there will be another, whenever their hubris leads us over the edge.</p>

<p>In other words, public transit - but you get to bear the full cost of ownership, fuel, and maintenance, and have no actual autonomy or privacy.</p>
<p>No doubt you will be served unskippable ads on the display screen every 30 seconds during your journey, too.</p>

        <p>Sadly this is a long time coming. It's so ridiculous I have trouble finding the words. This is the exact opposite direction we should be headed with technology but people will eat it up because of the emotional appeal. </p>
<p>They can take their tech and shove it if it's going to come with so many strings attached. I used to get excited at the advances we were making in tech, now I feel an urge to give it all up and go off grid entirely.</p>

<p>I started to suspect it when music went more and more digital in the 90s. You would think it would open up all kinds of creativity, (and it did to an extent! there is that side of it), but it also started to mean that technology was more and more dictating the kind of music that was being made and how it sounded.</p>
<p>Just by creating the systems that everybody was now operating with/in, the "lords of technology" were also creating patterns and userflows and presets that more and more people were conforming to.</p>
<p>Instead of just having everything crash together in all it's biological analog imperfection, things were becoming more and more "quantized" and "aligned" and "optimized" and "repeatable".</p>
<p>And I think that trand has just continued until now, via social media, it even includes our behaviour.</p>

<p>&rt;Instead of just having everything crash together in all it's biological analog imperfection, things were becoming more and more "quantized" and "aligned" and "optimized" and "repeatable".</p>
<p>This is the perfect foundation for crippling creativity, and reinforcing a hypnotic state of consumptive repetition.</p>
<p>As you said technology has its upsides musically but it can also be exploited to introduce subliminal messages. Nothing kooky like it saying "worship the devil" when played backwards, talk about a red herring, but frequencies that suggest negativity, aggression, etc.</p>
