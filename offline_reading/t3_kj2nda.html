    <strong>Anybody in Kansas sick of this nonsense?</strong>
    <p><p>Just trying to get this out there to as many eyes as possible. Please consider signing this petition. Link: <a href="https://lp.constantcontactpages.com/su/HiNTmBF/mandates">https://lp.constantcontactpages.com/su/HiNTmBF/mandat</a>  </p>
<p>Feel free to read about United Voices of Kansas here: <a href="http://unitedvoiceskansas.org/">unitedvoiceskansas.org</a>. A non profit organization that is backed by over 60 groups,  businesses, and organizations. They have been in contact with several Kansas legislators that back the initiative as well, but they need signatures! Once they have reached their goal, the Kansas legislators will hopefully be able to actually make some progress toward passing  legislation to remove mandates and health orders, as well as to remove  authority from the state and local governments to issue further mandates  as it relates to COVID-19.  </p>
<p>If you decide to sign the petition, here is what you are in agreement with:   </p>
<p>“I support my Kansas House Representative &amp; Senator in their effort to pass legislation to remove mandates &amp; health orders as well as to remove authority from the state and local government to issue future mandates as it relates to COVID-19. Allow personal choice for residents to decide if they do or do not want to wear a mask. Allow for K-12, college &amp; universities in-person learning &amp; activities. Businesses operate at their own discretion, and to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America and allow citizens of Kansas to be free from unconstitutional government restrictions.”</p>
<p>Again, here is the <a href="https://lp.constantcontactpages.com/su/HiNTmBF/mandates">link </a>to the petition. The address information in there is simply for the purpose of attaching your location to your Kansas senators and reps. Your identity won't be shared or sold. Please consider SIGNING and SHARING!</p></p>
