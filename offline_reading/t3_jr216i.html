    <strong>Honestly, i just need to vent</strong>
    <p><p>English is not my first language, so apologies if i write anything wrong. And sorry for the wall text!</p>
<p>My friends (all around 20-25 years old) are all paranoid due to covid. We haven’t seen each other since last friday, and last time before that was March, after we had Carnival in our country. </p>
<p>I only stopped working in April due quarantine, my company stopped and came back to work in may and have been working ever since, so i’m used to see people and all. It’s not shocking for me to go outside. My friends they all don’t work, and they stay home all day, seeing news and getting freaked out due to the “”very high death numbers””. I don’t argue with them because it’s useless. </p>
<p>And everybody here is forced to use masks, but of course outside no one bothers to. We had a few covid cases here and there but no one got infected inside the company and 0 people died due to covid in here. </p>
<p>And i must say, i HATE staying home. I am bored of videogames and i really miss my friends, i miss getting drunk and talking about random stuff. I miss parties and events like that. And i see other people getting reunited and partying every weekend and 0 covid cases. Large gatherings. And guess what? 0 deaths. I wanted to be there too, but i only see parties from people in at most acquaintances so i don’t want to invite myself to those places. And my friends haven’t doing anything like that because of fear and that’s what pisses me the most.</p>
<p>So, friday one of my friends mother went to travel and 7 of us went to his house, just chilling, talking and drinking like we used before everyone was scared of everything. B is like the main guy, everyone is his friend and we all know each other because of him. I also helped him get a job where i work because he was really needing. Have that in mind. </p>
<p>We went slept there, we had fun, and god how i needed that. But B’s girlfriend got pissed because we didn’t respect quarantine and it was dangerous. She’s one of my best friends from high school but she’s way too paranoid with everything and very exaggerated with those things. She basically told B not to ever do that. And guess what? He obeyed. And if we do meet again, she will be mad again and none of the other guys want to hang out because of her.</p>
<p>But she’s not mad because she’s worried about us. She says she’s respect quarantine but B goes to her house monthly. She want everyone to respect quarantine but she doesn’t herself. She says it’s only one person in her house so that’s okay. She’s basically an hypocrite but she didn’t like when i said the facts to her.</p>
<p>So i pissed af. At least i heard that the local sauna is open, i think i will just hang out in there and make new friends with a mindset like me. I have asthma and not even i am afraid of this bullshit tbh. My friends are all terrified because of mídia and it fucking sucks.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading my rant.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, unfortunately. And i hate seeing her enforcing rules she doesn’t follow herself. </p>
<p>Well, i think it’s more than time to make new friends. They believe everything they read and they get anxious over anything.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it sucks. I just wish i could see my friends.</p>
<p>Daily i read the news and see the number of cases dropping and i wonder if they’d ever believe it or continue using the “fake news cause of politics” thing.</p>
