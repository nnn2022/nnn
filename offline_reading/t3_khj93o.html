    <strong>Thoughts on the current situation</strong>
    <p><p>In my metro area, masks are required in all publicly accessable buildings. Stores, churches, wherever. Everyone is pretty good at the social distancing thing. I have not seen or heard of anyone not being compliant.</p>
<p>Yet, we are being told that the COVID numbers and hospitalizations are increasing. If these measures are as effective as the "experts" claim they are, then how is this possible? If these measures are effective, then it's logical to expect these numbers to be more or less non-increasing or increasing at a (much?) lower rate.</p>
<p>Instead, we're told and expected to believe that even with a vaccine, we will still have to wear masks. We are told not to ask questions and that challenging the ideology or narrative is dangerous. It's all doom and gloom. We're being told to <em>indefinitely</em> give up our basic freedoms and getting less than nothing in return. We're not even getting safety and security in exchange. This should make any rational person very nervous.</p>
<p>To be honest, it looks to me like society's germaphobia is being leveraged for compliance. In other words, a large scale obsessive compulsive behavior is being used to fuel this.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p></p>

<p>Because the policies, from a scientific perspective, were never meant to prevent increasing numbers of cases. They are not even conceptualized to prevent exponentiation. The entire purpose is to slow the exponentiation across the population so that the number of sick and dying don't spike so dramatically that healthcare supply chains don't fall apart.   </p>
<p>Now, for everything else. IMO government officials, governors, city mayors, etc are getting hard thinking about all the power they've suddenly accumulated.  Sadly, then you give power to some people they will do everything not to relinquish it.</p>

<p>Our parent's generation did not question authority any more than our generation is now. Power begets power, and that's what we're seeing. An ever-increasing paternal government.</p>

<p>So are you claiming that nothing has changed?</p>
<p>"Our parent's generation did not question authority any more than our generation is now."</p>
<p>I don't think so. Their parents had more recent memories of McCarthy and the unrest due to Vietnam. From what I've seen my grandparent's and parent's generation more likely to tell the government to f**k off.</p>

        <p>Propaganda is powerful, those supporting the lockdowns are just as likely to be distrustful of the government.   </p>
<p>Your parent's generation had memories of McCarthy like ours has of the drug war, and we're always suspicious. Yet these things keep happening. Why?  Because people are fundamentally flawed and open to fear-mongering propaganda.    </p>
<p>If anti-Chinese propaganda reached a height today, our society would be just as vulnerable to mass hysteria as it was in the past.   </p>
<p>Fundamentally, nothing has changed. In the McCarthy Era it was only in someone's wet dreams the possibility of having hyper-militarized police forces completely subjugate black and anti-war protesters and imprison them while making the entire population view them as enemies.   </p>
<p>During the hight of the drug wars it was only a wet dream in someones head that they could completely control the everyday actions of every individual in America and yet we are here.   </p>
<p>Power is ever-increasing and no generation yet has stood up to it or question it.</p>

        <p>Maybe I just hangout with a bunch of people who are unusually rebellious. I'm also Eastern Orthodox and the collective memories of living under communism are quite vivid. </p>
<p>LOL! Even the collective memories of what happened over 1000 years ago in the Byzantine Empire are still very much alive!</p>

        <p>Winter right? It’s flu season, we’ve entered a period of time where viruses thrive and people with respiratory conditions are at more risk and then you just stack COVID on that and people take it less seriously than ever now, so of course numbers will go up. I think it’s gonna mostly go away when the vacation is available for gen-pop, but some people might still wear masks and there’s gonna be a weird getting back to normal shift. I also think that there will be precautions put in place in case another pandemic pops up, which it will because people still be peoplein’.</p>

<p>I think you meant "vaccination", but a vacation would also be nice. </p>
<p>Did you read my last paragraph? If compulsive obsessive behavior is being leveraged, then there is no getting back to normal. That's what's so dangerous.</p>

        <p>Lmao! Maybe I just got vacation on the brain. And yeah I get that, but I think we're doing it to ourselves if that makes sense. Like I don't think this is a government issue, I think its a personal issue that everyone in society is going through at once. How much do you value others? How much do you value personal freedom? These values are in direct conflict when you talk about how to fuck corona virus. Its hard to trust any info out there, but I don't think the road ends in someone's out to get you. Cause if thats the case then just buy guns, wear a mask, and mind your business right? Thats what I do. I feel bad for business owners but people who are unable to pivot to online/dilevery business models are likely going to fail eventually with or without covid. But I don't know anything, I just write nonsense and keep an eye on both sides in case anyone wants to start something violent. </p>
<p>To be clear, I'm not say the government isn't involved it had to get involved. I think there's some shady shit that happened for sure. But I don't think it has anything to do with our personal freedoms. More of a coup to oust Trump, which is what it is politics always have been seedy always will be seedy.</p>
