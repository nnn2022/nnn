    <strong>To Doomers:</strong>
    <p><p>the reason we are all ‚Äúselfish narcissists‚Äù who ‚Äúlack empathy‚Äù is because we can‚Äôt see this as ‚Äúfor the good of humanity‚Äù because:</p>
<p>The virus isn‚Äôt lethal to the MAJORITY of the population.</p>
<p>Covid testing is always giving false positives and is now used as a scare tactic.</p>
<p>We all know many people who die these days and test positive for covid is labeled a covid death so hospitals get reimbursements. If the testing is messed up, how do we know people are dying from this? How do we know it‚Äôs not mislabeled? How do we know we‚Äôre spreading it constantly when the tests themselves are usually wrong?</p>
<p>Hear  me out, if the data is super wrong, and we know deaths aren‚Äôt as high as the mainstream wants us to believe, how are we supposed to play along and be ‚Äúempathetic‚Äù like the rest of you masking up when this whole thing feels like lie?  Because a lot of us don‚Äôt think that this data is reputable at all. I think a lot of doomers don‚Äôt understand that we think this whole thing is exaggerated to the max. You‚Äôre right wearing a mask ISNT a big deal. But it‚Äôs been a year, we have more proof the data for testing and deaths has been exaggerated and inflated, it‚Äôs not that we don‚Äôt have empathy, we‚Äôre just not playing along with the theatrics you believe.</p></p>

        <p>Most of these people have no critical thinking skills whatsoever. They have been rewarded since childhood for doing as they are told and thinking as they are told, and now they get praise for conforming. </p>
<p>I believe people have a right to do as they wish. If you want a vaccine, fine. Don't want a vaccine? You do you. The problem comes when human rights are stripped away for "the good of humanity".</p>
<p>The biggest issue is that people who blindly conform can't visualise the bigger picture. They trust institutions and appeal to authority. Not necessarily because they themselves are dumb, but because we live in a world where instant gratification wins. Why bother researching a complex topic extensively and making a well informed decision when you can let the "experts" tell you what to do? Saves a lot of time and energy. </p>
<p>Those of us that can see behind the smoke and mirrors need to band together and stand our ground. It is the only hope we have of preserving and reinstating our basic freedoms.</p>

        <p>Yep, those who are unable to look at official statistics and risk assess for themselves are very much missing the whole point here. </p>

        <p>Attacking your position as lacking empathy is merely an ad hominem attack used as a last ditch argument when they realize you aren't buying what they're selling. Who has less empathy? The group of people who want to live and let live, everyone taking their own risks as they assess them in order to navigate the treacherous waters of life, or those who want to throw millions of people out of work, disrupt their private lives, prevent them from being with their loved ones in the hospital/on their death beds, to presume the right to assess the acceptable risks for other people's lives, etc...?</p>
