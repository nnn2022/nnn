        <p>He's very well spoken and speaks from the heart. I'm 6 minutes in and it's real good.</p>
<p>Excellent conversation... I quote: Now this semester I was forced to teach online, which I detest and the students hate it too, and it's get into the whole push for us to live our lives online, which I think is part of this covid crisis agenda. In my opinion covid is the most successful propaganda drive in American history, world history.</p>
<p>I'm at hour and fifteen minutes in... This professor could be one of us, he's exactly on the money, his theories are well thought out. He mentions the great reset agenda by Klaus Schwab and other things we all know and exposed here.</p>
<p>This guy is getting fired 100 percent, he can wake up too many people and they aren't tolerating that. From articles I dug up about firing him, it seems the people in charge at NYU received orders to make his voice disappear. He's old and sick so probably doesn't give a shit about the back lash from the deep state minions, he's a libertarian and it shows.</p>
