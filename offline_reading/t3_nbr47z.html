        <p>Doubt you'll get anywhere with Lovememychem.  They removed a comment I made, even though I coted reliable evidence, that disproved the Covid hype.  I was told it was uncivil.</p>
<p>When I asked for an explanation as to what exactly was uncivil about it, I was perma-banned.</p>
<p>Evidently proving one of this mods buddies wrong is against their rules.  That person not only drank the Koolaod, but keeps mixing up gallons of the stuff.</p>

        <p>Are you saying this mod is throwing their weight around there?</p>
<p>If so, perhaps there can be escalation of this.</p>
<p>I don't really care, but it would be very nice to see that, for once, they get called out for using their power to censor vital conversation from the general public.</p>

        <p>I've seen other people here showing this mod banned them.  They also remove posts left and right.  They also blocked me from contacting any of the mods on that sub.</p>
<p>I don't know if there's any way to escalate this.  Afaik mods can do whatever they damn well please within their sub.  I reported this to main Reddit, and got no response.  But I wish you luck.  This mod is power-tripping, pure and simple.</p>
<p>Edit:  Also, pretty sure they flagged me as a conspiracy theorist and as spreading misinformation  as punishment for my insolence.  The Covid vaccine sub auto-banned me and it gave that as the reason.</p>

        <p>Is there any way to contact mods directly, like as a DM or PM that another mod couldn't just block? That seems like them being drunk with power and trying to undermine authority if they are blocking your ability to appeal your ban. That would require Reddit intervention immediately if they had that much power.</p>
<p>Unless Reddit is just giving this power without thinking of caring what it would do. In that case...holy hell!</p>

        <p>Facebook amd Twitter have been doing the same thing for a year.  Banning and censoring those qho questioned the narrative.  Reddit is no different </p>
<p>I will say the coronavirus sub didn't use to bam people for speaking out.  The members would jist mass downvote them.  Then, the members started waking up and questioning this nonsense.  That's when the bans started.</p>

        <p>Have been half tempted to start my own covid subreddit that would be for more balanced discussion that people can go and talk and not have to worry about being judged for their views. Strict rules so all views are treated with a degree of respect. Perhaps this is the time for something like this.</p>
<p>Something is telling me they don't want this to end so they will be able to keep their power.</p>

        <p>I remember the same thing happening with Y2K.  This guy had a ton of gasoline and TP stored in his basement.  He was going to be king!</p>
<p>Then, the world didn't end and he just wasn't the same after that.  It broke him. This will be the same thing.  Covid gave weak people the chance to be bigshots.</p>

        <p>It is sad that we’ve gotten to this level of censorship. If you had said one day prior to Johnson and Johnson having their vaccine paused that it may give you blood clots, Facebook and Twitter would have banned you. When the narrative is so fragile that conversations can’t happen with opposing views, something is off. </p>
<p>One of my favorite podcast episodes was between Texas congressman Dan Crenshaw and Bret Weinstein. Dan is a staunch conservative while Bret is unapologetically liberal. Their conversation was informative and respectful, with each agreeing on a lot of issues but seeing different avenues to get to the solution. We are at the point where civil discourse is impossible.</p>
