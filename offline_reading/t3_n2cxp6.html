    <strong>If you make a comparison, do it properly</strong>
    <p><p>I saw a doctor holding a sign that said he had seen a lot of things, but not smallpox or polio due to vaccines, therefore the covid vaccine worked aswell he concluded.</p>
<p>That is like saying pancuronium bromide and aspirin are both chemicals used on humans and as aspirin is safe, pancuronium bromide is safe.</p>
<p>(if you don't know pc is what is used in a lethal injection) </p>
<p>What worries me most about this is that a real doctor, who should know better, stands with his name behind that statement.</p></p>

        <p>5 years ago I went to my state insurance doctor for a physical for university. I told him to look at my vaccine records and tell me if I needed any of them updated (I’m aware of you needing tetanus and other boosters, I hadn’t had any in 10 years to that point which is why I asked) because my school emailed me saying some people born when I was didn’t receive a second vaccine for something so I needed to check that as well as boosters. He looked at the neatly stacked vaccination records I handed him in a nice, new Manila folder. From my birth to my public school and military vaccinations in order by date. He looks back at me and says, “I don’t understand what you’re asking me, do you want a vaccine? Which one? And do you have any problems? Like health wise? I don’t understand what you mean by ‘make sure your records are up to date.’ If you feel you need a booster vaccine we can give you one for $80 today” If I wasn’t so damn mad at him my jaw wouldn’t hit the floor, not that this imbecile wouldn’t even notice that medical discovery in the flesh. How insane does that sound? I asked a professional doctor to look at my vaccinations records, because I’m attending University in the fall and they need to be up to date. And all he can muster is “do you have any medical problems or wanna pay for a vaccine today? I can give you one.” I stormed out of there, and never went back. Add that one to the G.I. specialist I went to in the military who couldn’t diagnose G.I. problems (later found to be a developed allergy/immune reaction, which I believe to be from the anthrax vaccine or initial flu mist I had to receive in basic in 2008 where I signed a waiver) that brought me into his office and went through my symptoms and what we tried over 6 months to fix to no avail to say, “Well, I’m stumped, what do you think it is? Any ideas of what could be a cause?” I have given up on doctors and do not trust anything they say. They literally parrot what the WHO and CDC tell them and they get their stuff from the Bill Gates network so it’s all a sham to me.</p>

        <p>I like humble doctors. The bad ones are those that jump at the opportunity to pump you full of meds. Your story actually sounds like those guys were cool, it seems like they were empowering you at least a little. I convinced myself I needed to get a tetanus shot for prevention but when I went to the Doc he said, "You do realise there are treatments for tetanus"
Saved money and avoided medical intervention. Some Docs are good guys.</p>

        <p>My dad (who largely goes with a lot of the mainstream narrative) is actually super skeptical of the vaccine. He recently went to his doctor (who is from Texas but has been practicing in a deep blue northeast state for decades) asked him if he was or wanted to be vaccinated. When my dad said no, he said he wouldn’t advise it because my dad (in his mid-50’s) is not really at risk and it would not be a big deal most likely if he did get it. Agreed that there are still SOME good doctors out there who are honest with their patients and not out to make money on incentivizing drugs. Just wanted to add this story</p>

        <p>Thanks for piling on. I just read "A Country Doctor" by Sarah Orne Jewett and I do think it's important to recognize that there is a huge difference between a Doctor and Medical Dictator.</p>
<p>From Jewett:</p>
<p>&rt; Dr. Johnson said long ago that physicians were a class of men who put  bodies of which they knew little into bodies of which they knew less,  but certainly this isn't the fault of the medicines altogether; you and I  know well enough they are often most stupidly used. If we blindly  follow the medical dictators, as you call them, and spend our treatment  on the effects instead of the causes, what success can we expect? We do  want more suggestions from the men at work, but I suppose this is the  same with every business. The practical medical men are the juries who  settle all the theories of the hour, as they meet emergencies day after  day."</p>

        <p>If I don’t know if my shots are current, because I don’t know the medical recommended timelines for boosters, I expect my Doctor to know. Not be puzzled at why I would be asking. He wasn’t acting empowering, he was just an idiot. I literally pointed to the dates of my last boosters and said “Since these dates until today has enough time passed that another booster is necessary so I may attend University this fall” he still didn’t understand. Maybe he was empowering by default to his idiocy, but he was just flat out unaware of booster timelines. That’s something your regular doctor, and a regular practicing physician that is supposed to make should know. If a doctor is asked to look at your vaccine and immunization records so that they can check off that you are up to date, wouldn’t that require knowing how long between boosters another shot is necessary? I know most don’t believe in vaccines here, but I do, as long as they are long term use with no side effects. Wouldn’t it suck if your doctor didn’t let you know you missed a booster and were compromised and you ended up getting some disease that hasn’t been around in forever and there’s a proven vaccine for? Regardless. The point is, he was a doctor, who couldn’t do the basic job of signing off on up to date immunizations for University. Something he should be doing regularly as a doctor, especially in a state as large as mine with as many prestigious Universities as there is. I couldn’t have been the first person to go to his office and check to see if their immunizations were up to date for school. Yet he acted like I was the first person in history to do such.</p>

        <p>Oh yeah, I thought there was something off with this story. Your doctor was a good doctor trying to get you to think for yourself. Educational institutions are Numero Uno for being Vax Farmers. You wouldn't get a disease that's been around forever with a "proven" vax because that is not how illness works. It's incredibly selfish for citizens of the developed world to go on and on about their fear of measles or tetanus and become pharmaceutical salesmen for developing countries as a cover for bringing about good health. If more resources were utilized for clean water, wholesome food and proper shelter the mortality of diseases would disappear. So your doctor was asking you.... what shots do you need? and you were unable to answer his question and thereby he avoided giving you a treatment without your informed consent. Send him a thank you note.</p>

        <p>Not really. He couldn’t answer my question. Which was necessary for University. If I needed a booster or did not have the 2nd dose of the infant stage immunization they mentioned to me that was REQUIRED. Once again I gave him my vax records and he didn’t understand. I ended up going to Uni, not having the booster, and needing to get one before being able to step foot on campus. So I think you’re just not really understanding how idiotic he was in this situation. Add to that he was 340+ lbs and reeked of cigarette smoke, most likely from the box of Marlboro reds in his breast pocket, I think I made the right choice. The doctor my school insurance referred me to understood exactly what I was asking and then gave me my booster shot and sent me on my way. But if you say so.</p>

        <p>I think you’re just anti vax and anytime a person steers you away from such you think they are genius. Sad. Not all vaccines are bad, and why wouldn’t I get a vaccine booster of a proven vaccine I’ve already had previously? Why use therapeutics and go through symptoms when not necessary. If there’s a tried and true vaccine that’s proven in human use, I’ll take it all day. If much rather get a proven immunization of Ebola than to get Ebola, and suffer the symptoms until the therapeutics do or do not work. That’s idiotic. Lol.</p>

        <p>Yeah I saw that.</p>
<p>First of all the covid vaccine is a completely different type of vaccine (mRNA) so there is no experience with it.</p>
<p>Second in the past we had medicine like thalidomide that also was considered completely safe but then later was found to cause irreparable damage to their kids.</p>
<p>Third plenty of people already died from the vaccine and even tho it may work, I'm not ready to take that risk compared to my high chance of surviving covid.</p>
<p>I mean if he's a doctor then how he come not seen this stuff I just said. As a doctor he has to tell you all risks of a vaccine and then you can make a choice whether you want it or not.</p>
