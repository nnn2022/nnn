    <strong>The Soul of the West is already Dead</strong>
    <p><p>So I've been on this idea for a while, and it seems indisputable to me that the West as a civilization has crumbled. Starting after Antiquity (Greeks/Romans) The West more or less formed around the time Christianity became a major world influence. As Rome fell, Christian morals became the loose string connecting Europe together. And many Christian morals actually came from/were shared with the great ancient Greek thinkers like Aristotle, so I'm not exactly saying the West is what it is because of Christianity, just that Christianity played a major role in forming the world post-Roman empire. </p>
<p>The West is born on the idea of a higher power, unknowable to us but still worthy of pursuit. It is the idea that this life is not perfect, but that perfection <em>does</em> exist. We we must work to make ourselves more perfect beings. That is the heart of Western civilization, the belief in a cosmic order which we should learn about and act according to. </p>
<p>This is a major distinction from the East, which largely viewed life as a static thing (consider the fact that China did not change practically at all for two thousand years, and Confusciousim/Bhuddism is largely a belief of being in the present moment and accepting/being at peace with yourself and the Universe.), or the Islamic religion states, which view life on Earth as essentially a battleground of faith. This life was meant for worship, and you must do everything you can to convert to the "one true God". Now, none of this is to say anyone is more right or wrong and I say it without passing judgement and recognizing that I am over simplifying, but the major distinction here is that the West is this great mix of surrendering to a higher order yet still striving in our lives to reach it. That there <em>is</em> structure, there <em>are</em> rules, there is a hierarchy (see feudalism, democracy), and you exist in it as a means to an end. Your life serves a purpose, a progressive purpose, not just in the eyes of God or in your own life, but in the very fabric of human history. The government we create exists to make humanity a better place, to make each of us better people and have more opportunity to succeed. You can compare this to the non-Western world, where individual rights and opportunity for individual success is not favored as heavily, and the focus is more on preserving the status quo, or putting the nation ahead of yourself. </p>
<p>I could go on for a very long time about this, but here is my ultimate point: </p>
<p>The current world we live in does not share this Western conception anymore. The soul of the West is gone, and what we have now is a strange void, an empty cooalition built on just one thing : equality. No one is allowed to be better than the other, and no one is allowed to feel anything that may offend another. </p>
<p>Where we once believed that men and women must strive to be the best versions of themselves, we now accept all for everything, no matter what, with absolutely no prospective thinking. Equality reigns supreme. We are no longer interested in a higher order, a way of doing things to make ourselves better. Everything our governments now stand for is equality. Our senses, our human bodies, our passions and pains reign supreme. We care not for reason, or for spirituality, but only for our immediate pleasures and pains. There is no goal, there is no perfect state to work for. All we focus on is making sure everyone is equal. </p>
<p>Now, many of you probably think that this is a good thing. And to convince you that it is not would require an entire book. However, before you all freak out: I do agree equality is a good thing. But I do not agree that it is <em>The Good</em>. </p>
<p>In all, the Old world viewed this Earth and our human bodies as imperfect, but worthy of admiration and a noble attempt to make them better. It required a sense of humility, of selflessness, and reasoning., We therefore built societal systems and governance to bring out the best in us and achieve a more perfect union. The NEW world is government entirely by our bodies and physical sensations with no higher purpose. Our passions and pains are the decision makers. The county is trillions in debt and we just faced a novel coronavirus? Let's print 45% of all of our money ever in a single year. We don't want to have to deal with a depression. Immigrants are being left in detention camps at the border? Well that's not nice, let's let them all in and not even consider the demographic impacts or impacts on our social security/economy. It is why our attention has turned to transgender bathrooms and gay marriage, and away from geopolitics, our societal framework, taxes, or legislative process. Order, stability, and longevity is no longer the chief Good of this world, equality is. Our human desires are fully controlling every decision we make, and to quote the great Morgan Freeman in Bruce Almighty, "Since when does anybody know what the hell they really want?" We are not wise enough to act purely on impulses, the best version of ourselves requires reason, care, diligence, and moderation. Should we jump on every passion we will surely lead ourselves into desolation. </p>
<p>We are not interested in being a better version of ourselves, but in making everyone feel appreciated for their very faults. Our governments exist to equalize everyone and everything, even if it makes absolutely no sense and will lower the quality of life across the board. This is where we are now. And it will quickly fail.</p></p>

        <p>The west has been consumed with chronic narcissism and celebrity worship.  </p>
<p>We've also demonized any notion of national pride and patriotism.  Patriotism is now called nationalism and labelled as racist.  A country putting its own citizens first is an unspeakable thought.</p>

        <p>That's exactly what I'm saying! Patriotism is a great mechanism for a group of people to band together for a higher good/order. That kind of sentiment is largely gone. </p>
<p>God forbid America has to fight a war in the near future. I don't think our country could unite in a war effort.</p>

        <p>Peter Hitchens also argues that the West on its final stretch (specifically the UK, he mentioned - but it very much applies to many other western places).</p>
<p>As much as I agree with this view just by pure observation...</p>
<p>I still trust my Lord fully and if it's his will to let us slip away (by our own deeds, not His), <strong><em>then so be it</em></strong>. All the more reason to pay attention to my own ways and correct myself as long as I still have the time to do so.</p>

        <p>Excellent analysis. Have you considered that wokeism is in many ways the same western Christian soul resurfaced in a mutated form? Same concept of Christian original sin, just morphed from all human beings to white people. Same faustian spirit of exploration, just morphed into radical experiments with "equality". It's as if our culture is going through some weird form of cancer where a body part that used to be functional is killing us.</p>

        <p>I like the analogy, but I don't think the "woke" are practicing Christianity at all. I know that's not what you're trying to get at, though. </p>
<p>From what I see, "Woke" Is the Nietzsche -ian "slave mentality". </p>
<p>I should actually start by saying the current world psychology is still dominated by the last best thinker, Fred Nietzsche. He is the last "flag bearer" of Wester thought, and his thinking led us to totalitarianism and the World Wars. His thoughts are the culmination of unequivocal Western dominance, and the subsequence confusion as to which all-powerful nation is truly the greatest in a world where the existence of God is largely questioned. This left nothing but men's passions to rule the world. </p>
<p>Anyways, he is right in many ways, one of which I find most profound is that within the human psyche is the master/slave mentality. The master is able to exercise his will on the world around him, the slave is not, and thus he turns inward on himself and seeks to master his own soul (this is the Will to Power, according to N, and he says that this is perhaps <em>the</em> driving force of mankind. This idea was proven wrong with WW2, in which it became clear that freedoms in both economics and liberty were much more meaningful and actually practically useful than aggressive, unified dominance). </p>
<p>Anyways, Wokeism is slave mentality. It is a group of frustrated millennials who are unable to exercise their will on the world around them. They are the first generation in America for perhaps a hundred years who are unable to contribute significantly or hold any real power in any meaningful sphere. For crying out loud, the President is 80 years old; millennials will literally never see real power in their entire lives at this rate. People younger than 40 in today's America have absolutely no power, and don't say people like AOC do, because she doesn't. She got kicked out of almost every meaningful legislative committee in Congress and largely serves as the token "youth" to get people riled up.  </p>
<p>This demographic, unable to exert power, turns inwards. They criticize each other because they seek to dominate their own will and those in their circle. They do so by virtue signaling. They become vegans, they become LGTBQ, they become anything contrary to public rationality because it is a way of dominating and discipling themselves, since they have no one else to conquer. And now we have a whole generation of slave-mentality adults.</p>
