    <strong>Did the terms - High risk/ Immunocompromised loose their meanings?</strong>
    <p><p>I hear these terms thrown around anytime someone mentions even the slightest desire to live a normal life again. The influx of these labels used is confusing and creating a great deal of skepticism in me. Seriously, how can this many people be immunocompromised - unless of course... They've changed the goalpost for what constitutes that label?</p>
<p>Here's what google says</p>
<p>" <strong>What conditions put you at higher risk of COVID-19?</strong></p>
<p>People with several chronic conditions are more likely to experience dangerous symptoms if infected with COVID-19 . These include type 2 diabetes, severe obesity and serious heart diseases. High blood pressure and type 1 diabetes may increase your risk of serious COVID-19 symptoms. "</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The only person I know who is truly high risk has had chronic heart problems. They kept people away from him, no real gatherings, it was largely understood. But this feels like a new buzzword with no real meaning anymore. More of the victimhood Olympics. "Wow, you think we should end the lockdown because YOU miss socializing? I AM HIGH RISK! My life should be put on the line because YOU want to go to the movies". It comes across like another political weaponized word. They say it and everyone has to obey without and real further explanation. Yes, they're high risk so we can't live normally.</p>
<p>I'm just sick of it. No pun intended. I see this cropping up everywhere. Just recently there's this term being thrown around called - "Ableist". I had no idea what it meant. " <strong>Ableism is</strong> the discrimination of and social prejudice against people with disabilities based on the belief that typical abilities are superior. At its heart, <strong>ableism is</strong> rooted in the assumption that disabled people require 'fixing' and defines people by their disability "</p>
<p>It's like - Normal people don't think this way. Normal people aren't out to hurt, harm, discriminate, or judge. We just want our lives back - but due to this sick victimhood culture, now EVERYONE has to walk around with some stupid label on them as to how they're unconsciously bigoted even if they don't know it. This is one of the biggest problems with covid and politics as a whole - as normal Macdonald Said "Do you know what a Cismale is? It's a way of marginalizing normal people". We're all put into groups now when most of us only have the desire to be left alone. </p></p>

        <p>Millennials love having a disability/disorder and being on meds. Saying you're high risk is like saying you're depressed. Gets the likes on the gram.</p>

        <p>Yes, they have. It's just the script they all read off of &amp; don't know why. </p>
<p>I can admit it, for a few weeks in March/April I was scared. Not so much since.</p>
<p>I'm high risk for Covid too, iga deficient, asthma, several neurological &amp; nerve issues &amp; I haven't had covid at all. I haven't had any illnesses really. I've been WFH since spring &amp; rarely go out, not by choice just nowhere to go. I'm also not getting the vaccine. I am, however, scared to death of catching something worse when everyone is free because I've been a shut in for so long.</p>

        <p>Yes. The term is widely misused by people who have one minor diagnosis. Just look at the Ask A Manager blog commentariat. Many of them have deemed themselves high risk, they have every phobia in the books. Many have mental health diagnosis and they are all militantly staying home (or so they say). I have seen several of them say that they are so high risk they will die if they leave their apartment! Stepping outside is too dangerous.</p>

        <p>I think the high risk/low-risk categories have their use as a way for people to make their own decisions about how much they should fear covid. I am low-risk, so I don't worry about it; if someone high-risk doesn't want to see me, I respect that. No need for hate or paranoia, just be more careful right now if you have diabetes etc or live with someone who does.</p>
<p>As for ableism, it is a very real problem, and in my opinion the lockdown fanatics have increased it. We see it when businesses refuse to honor medical mask exemptions, as they're required to do by the ADA. We also see a great deal of mental health ableism in the idea that it's feasible, even no big deal, for people who live alone and are depressed to isolate for months on end.</p>
