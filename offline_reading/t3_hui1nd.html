    <strong>Of masks, lockdown, and Canada, and the violation of multiple charter rights, as well as most provincial Healthcare Consent Acts</strong>
    <p><p>Unfortunately, while much of the same principles are shared among common law countries--as in, countries that 'make' law primarily through precedent and apply fact patterns vs. civil law wherein the system makes novel laws for specific issues--I can only speak on Canada, since this is where my education lies. </p>
<p>It is my ardent opinion, bare minimum, that mandatory mask laws as well as lockdown are a violation of Section 7 of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>--Life, liberty and security of the person--and <em>probably</em> a violation of section 8 'search and seizure'. Surprisngly, what is hosted on the Canadian justice website is very, very good and a pretty damned good rundown of what these sections cover:</p>
<p>https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/rfc-dlc/ccrf-ccdl/check/art7.html
https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/rfc-dlc/ccrf-ccdl/check/art8.html</p>
<p>First and foremost, it should be obvious that the lockdowns are, barring context, a fundamental violation of Section 7. Exceptions and states of emergency are more or less covered, but there's rather specific stipulations as to what can be reasonably inferred to count because of national security, this is a pretty high bar to pass, and requires a justified balancing of individual vs. societal interest. In the early stages of Covid, this would have been met immediately because of the air of uncertainty and disastrous consequences,  more or less anything went. In the four months now that has gone by, with absolutely paltry cases and death rates, this is now nothing close to justified, given the atmosphere of uncertainty <em>and what was said the populace when lockdowns began</em>. </p>
<p>Effectively, the lockdowns must have, at this point, clearly demonstratable and provable effects. Whether a judge follows this is another issue, but all in all, it is appearing that every business and individual being adversement affected can now make a Charter challenge. Section 8 above comes in through various oversteps regarding 'contact tracing', violating the right to Informational Privacy. </p>
<hr>
<p>Second, and this is more in my area of expertise:</p>
<p>Forced masking mandates are a fundamental overstep of the most basic principles of health systems. What we are being told about masks is that, regardless of origin, that they are a medical device--they are claimed to stop disease spread infectiousness, a claim reiterated by near every health unit. Unlike behavior alterations, a mask is something that you, well, wear--a tool you utilize, or rather are forced to. This is a fundamental violation of "No forced medical treatment" as per section 7, as well as most Health states. As I am from Ontario, I am most familiar with the Health Care Consent Act, found here:</p>
<p>https://www.canlii.org/en/on/laws/stat/so-1996-c-2-sch-a/latest/so-1996-c-2-sch-a.html?searchUrlHash=AAAAAQALY29uc2VudCBhY3QAAAAAAQ&amp;resultIndex=1#sec10subsec1_smooth</p>
<p>You, simply put, cannot be forced to undergo any type of medical treatment, and the sleight of hand claiming it's 'for others' does not hold a candle in real law systems (family court aside).</p></p>

        <p>That is an interesting topic. Are you aware of anyone challenging this in court? I'm so surprised so far that our courts have not ruled on anything in this regard here in Ontario.</p>

        <p>That is exactly my question too. The OCLA wrote a very well composed open letter to the WHO as well as local governments, with no effect. On their website, they are now advocating civil disobedience. I would have thought that they would have at least brought up a charter challenge or something if they so firmly believed in their position. 
My other question is also related to forced medical treatment. It looks to me like it doesn’t really mean anything. Even if they can’t force you to be vaccinated when the vaccine comes out or wear a face mask or anything else, you pretty much have no choice but to comply. What if stores, schools, hospitals, clinics, border control, ... all started asking for your “immunity passport” or you wouldn’t be allowed to enroll your kids in school, buy food, get medical treatment, travel, etc?
So even if they don’t violate your rights by not forcing whatever treatment on you, they can still make life difficult/impossible by denying you services. Or is that also somehow protected/guaranteed?</p>

        <p>Rocco Galati is the constitutional lawyer who will be presenting the case against the mandatory mask mandate in court (and against lockdowns and mandatory vaccinations as well I believe). </p>
<p>There's a CBC article about it in French: </p>
<p>https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1721137/constitution-charte-mesures-sanitaires-injonction-recours-judiciaire-science-faits-verifiables</p>
<p>...which I google translated here:</p>
<p>"Is the mandatory mask constitutional?</p>
<p>Face covering requirement unconstitutional, say plaintiffs who filed suit in Ontario.</p>
<p>Canadians have filed a constitutional complaint in the courts to challenge the requirement to wear masks in closed public places. They consider that this protection is not based on any scientific fact.</p>
<p>Their defense will first seek an injunction in Ontario Superior Court this summer to overturn the requirement to wear the face covering before their case is heard on the merits. This hearing will take place in the winter at the earliest.</p>
<p>According to their court document, the plaintiffs claim that the sanitary measures that public health authorities have established to combat the novel coronavirus are ineffective, unwarranted and illegal, because they are not based on any scientific or medical evidence and are even dangerous to the health of Canadians.</p>
<p>The 900-page appeal is large, complex and includes, in addition to the mask, other measures, such as quarantine, containment, physical distancing and the closure of businesses at the start of the pandemic.</p>
<p>We have the testimonies of 43 experts in Canada and around the world who maintain that these measures are not supported by any scientific fact, that they have not previously been the subject of any clinical trial that could have proven their effectiveness and that 'they are extreme in the circumstances, says plaintiffs lawyer Rocco Galati.</p>
<p>Galati represents seven complainants and the Vaccine Choice Canada association, which advocates the optional use of vaccines. Their names were censored there, except that of Denis Rancourt, a former professor of physics at the University of Ottawa.</p>
<p>The appeal targets around twenty people, entities, municipal and regional administrations and public health agencies. It includes Prime Ministers Justin Trudeau and Doug Ford, the Chief Administrator of the Public Health Agency of Canada, Dr. Theresa Tam, and the Mayor of Toronto, John Tory.</p>
<p>Galati argues that there is an abundant scientific literature on the mask's ineffectiveness against airborne viruses and the danger it poses to those with an underlying medical condition, such as difficulty breathing.</p>
<p>"Dr. Tam said in March that the mask was not necessary, as Torontonians and Montrealers traveled by subway without a face cover, and four months later, suddenly, the mask becomes mandatory as the curve turns. flattens. How has science been able to evolve in such a short time?", he wonders.</p>
<p>Galati adds that Dr. Tam is only following the guidelines of the WHO and the Atlanta CDC, which at the time did not recommend that the mask be mandatory. The public takes everything Dr Tam says to them as gospel, but organizations like the WHO or the CDC are not foolproof, says Rocco Galati.</p>
<p>"It's even written in large print on the boxes of masks that they don't protect you from COVID-19, so what's the logic?"</p>
<p>The lawyer points out that the Trudeau government has even been bold enough to threaten to prosecute anyone criminally for disinformation, if information that contradicts those of the authorities about COVID-19 were published. It's madness, he continues.</p>
<p>Galati also accuses the authorities of having procrastinated on the usefulness of the mask before making it compulsory.</p>
<p>The Toronto lawyer also says that governments have not presented any scientific evidence to the public of what they are saying today about the benefits of face covering. It is not normal in a democracy to force a public health agency to reveal their sources in court, he adds.</p>
<p>Lawyer Christopher Rudnicki, who specializes in appeal procedures, argues that governments are entitled to change their mind in light of new scientific evidence and that such a way of doing things is a good way to elaborate public health policies.</p>
<p>Galati adds that he is very anxious to confront the data of the experts that the defendants will have to present in court to justify their sanitary measures. There is no inherent right to life and security of the person more fundamental than the right to breathe, he said, adding that the visor would be more appropriate.</p>
<p>The lawyer finally adds that the rate of infection identified in the population is irrelevant and that only the death rate is important in the adoption of public health policies. 99% of those who caught the virus recovered; in fact, 84% of those who died or died from complications were living in long-term care facilities across the country, he said.</p>
<p>Constitutionalist Julius Gray adds, however, that the after-effects of the disease are not to be taken lightly. For a few days now, publications have shown that even for people who do not die from it, there are often significant sequelae 2 or 3 months later, and we do not know if they will recover 100% ... it is a serious illness and there is more than mortality, he explains.</p>
<p>Me Galati also regrets that citizens do not inform themselves enough to know more about this subject. People are afraid and it is legitimate to be afraid, but when fear sets in before the unknown or what they perceive to be a threat, they are ready to accept any explanation from the authorities, says- he. The plaintiff's lawyer also denies subscribing to any conspiracy theory on this virus.</p>
<p>A precedent in Canada</p>
<p>This is the first time that health measures in Canada will have to pass the test of the courts. In the United States and Romania, certain measures have been qualified as unconstitutional, because they limit the rights and freedoms under the Constitution of these countries.</p>
<p>The Constitutional Court of Romania, for example, invalidated the measures of the local government in the fight against COVID-19, in particular because it adopted these measures in the form of decrees and without debate in Parliament with the opposition. also mention in our arguments, it is neither democratic nor constitutional, underlines Me Galati.</p>
<p>Me Gray nevertheless notes that Romania does not have a great liberal tradition like Canada and recalls that the decrees which have been adopted here are justified by a law which allows the use of decrees.</p>
<p>However, he agreed that it would have been useful to discuss the wearing of masks in the federal Parliament or in the provincial legislatures before making it compulsory. I am [nevertheless] convinced that there is not a single party among those represented in Ottawa or Queen's Park which would have opposed it, he said.
The Canadian Civil Liberties Association does not believe that the plaintiffs' recourse is futile, but it questions their strategy to question health measures against COVID-19, because their recourse touches on many areas.</p>
<p>The courts are not there to question government policies or to decide whether they are good or bad, but rather to ensure that they are constitutional, explains its spokesperson, lawyer Cara Zwibel.
Ms. Zwibel says the cause will not be easy to defend, because these measures include guarantees and accommodations for those who cannot wear a mask for health reasons, she continues.</p>
<p>The lawyer for the ACLC adds that these guarantees are so flexible that the opponents to the compulsory wearing of the mask do not have to justify their refusal to wear it to a police officer with a contraindication from his doctor.</p>
<p>Nothing strikes me [in these sanitary measures] as being unreasonable, adds Gray. In times of unprecedented crisis, public health trumps individual rights as long as the restrictions are reasonable, he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Gray believes that section 1 of the Charter allows for the application of reasonable limits against certain freedoms in our democracies.</p>
<p>"You can't always predict what will happen because of emergencies that arise; freedoms are in conflict with each other, there is the right to life and security of person and liberty [to walk around without a mask]. What is most important? "</p>
<p>Christopher Rudnicki argues that the complainants are very unlikely to be right, because their approach is disproportionate.</p>
<p>"There is", according to Me Rudnicki, "a consensus in the scientific community on the effectiveness of the mask, in particular among vulnerable people. If the authorities targeted in this appeal are able to defend the legitimacy and the raison d'être of their health measures, the courts will find them right.", he predicts.</p>
<p>In this sense, the balance of probabilities will be decisive according to him. In the end, it will be the scientific facts of Mr. Galati's witnesses who will have to convince the judge in relation to the scientific facts of the public health authorities, he explains.</p>
<p>Gray adds that dissent in the scientific world is not new and that not all scientists share the same ideas on issues. There are always people who do not believe that global warming is real and, in the current context, I think it would be reckless to rely on dissent.
He thinks it is in the public interest to hear the cause anyway, because the virus is not going to go away or even if a vaccine were to emerge, because it will take at least six months to distribute it.</p>
<p>"Even those who oppose it should at least recognize that it is important in a democracy to scrutinize the authorities' actions in emergency situations and measure the impact on freedoms to see if they are really necessary", adds Cara Zwibel.</p>
<p>The parties have been notified of the appeal. In a statement, the Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General declined to comment, however, since the dispute is now before the courts."</p>

        <p>That's great news. But I'm sure it the injunction will not be given. Nevertheless, at least it happens.</p>
<p>Wonder if it is a good choice to mix all these items or if it would have been better to do them individually. Not sure if they can stop individual measures or only all of them (which would not happen).</p>
<p>Thanks for keeping this topic alive :)</p>

        <p>Hey, no worries! </p>
<p>I believe he's doing them separately and I actually forgot one really important one he's doing, filing a suit against the government for essentially imprisoning the elderly in care homes without allow them to leave their rooms or socialize with anyone or see their families. When you really think about what the elderly had to suffer through during this pandemic - they are truly the silent victims in all this. 
Here's a video of him talking about his lawsuits: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghka1b3aPVk&amp;feature=youtu.be</p>
<p>and you can follow him on Twitter where he says he'll be posting updates to his cases and interesting and useful info @roccogalatilaw</p>

        <p>Thanks. And yes, the abuse of the elder and other groups has been abhorrent. 
Will follow him on twitter. Watched the video, a bit too far in the crazy area for me - chipping via vaccinations? cmon. There is also more than enough to criticize Bill Gates without calling him a eugenicists, no need to resort to this.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I wish him luck in court, the overreach of the government needs to end, and if only a nutjob wants to take this on, then well, all the best.</p>

        <p>Yes, really bad idea to sue in the name of anti-vaxxers. They have a bad rep. That association alone will ensure that the appeal will be rejected. I hope there will be other legal challenges, by other teams, more focused in their claims, and more careful about the importance of public perception.</p>
