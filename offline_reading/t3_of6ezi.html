    <strong>IMPORTANT - Something everyone should understand about bans and using alts in other subreddits.</strong>
    <p><p>It is against reddit's policies for you to use an alternate account to post in communities you have been banned from under any other name. They enforce this by tracking IP addresses and presumably they use browser fingerprinting technology. </p>
<p>Normally the admins only get involved in this type of ban-evasion enforcement when it comes to spammers and persistent psychopaths who can't just go away.</p>
<p>The conspiracy theorist in me thinks that reddit may be coordinating with the Ã¼bermod who is setting up the ban bots as a way to get around banning this community directly. If they could ban the users for violating policy, they could kill two birds with one stone and come out clean.</p>
<p>If you want to post on subreddits you have been banned from because you posted here, please act to protect yourself by using a VPN anytime you browse reddit. However, that is only one part of protecting your alt account. You should also use a different browser than the one you use for your main account. This will keep reddit from being able to definitively identify you. </p>
<p>Alternatively, I personally recommend using Brave browser because it has anti-fingerprinting technology. You can use it in incognito mode to guarantee you won't be identified through cookies either.</p></p>
