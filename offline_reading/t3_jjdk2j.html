    <strong>Tom Clancy The Corona Prophet... Or Co-incidence??? An Interesting Rabbit-Hole.</strong>
    <p><p>Don't know if there are any fans of Clancy's books here, but I have noticed some eerie parallels between real-world events and his books - especially in regards to present US politics and the ongoing scam called the "Rona - like these:</p>
<p>The Hunt For Red October:</p>
<p>- Clancy was debriefed by the NSA and CIA because his depiction of submarine warfare, nuclear launch protocols, and the alert state matrix leading from crisis to war were so accurate, they believed he had insider information.</p>
<p>Debt of Honor: </p>
<p>- Eerie parallels between the airliner crashing into the Capitol Building in the novel, and the 9/11 plane which crashed in Shanksville (believed to be headed for the White House). The events in the novel (which are part of a larger agenda) are covertly orchestrated and manipulated behind the scenes by... <em>China</em>.</p>
<p>Executive Orders:</p>
<p>- The President isn't a party man, and owes no favours to anyone for his position. He is popular with the average person, but hated by the media, the elites, political operatives, and lobbyists. The similarities to Donald Trump are obvious.</p>
<p>- The President faces constant attacks by biased media, traitorous bureaucrats, and a political swamp which bears a striking resemblance to the current Democratic Party. The objective is to unseat him, by any means fair or foul.</p>
<p>- A deadly virus is unleashed in the US, creating a panic similar to what we see now. The swamp use the virus as a tool to attempt to unseat the President (who appears to be a populist). There is also an attempt to deliberately crash the US economy. All orchestrated  by... <em>China</em>.</p>
<p>It certainly got my attention once I re-read the books and the similarities jumped out at me. An interesting rabbit hole to ponder, if nothing else!</p></p>

        <p>The same thing had occurred to me, particularly in the hopeful days off 2016-2017</p>

        <p>We could only wish for a President like the fictional Jack Ryan. I loved the ending of the book where the Iranian ayatollah gets to listen to Ryan call him out on television and watch the incoming cruise missile just before it blows him to atoms!</p>
<p>It would have made an amazing movie, but was too un-PC; they would have butchered it like they did with The Sum of All Fears.</p>

        <p>I got into Clancy because of the Rainbow 6 game (among others) but his books are great too.</p>
