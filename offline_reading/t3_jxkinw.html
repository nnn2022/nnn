    <strong>Mega Vent Post for anyone interested in a random guys opinion of our future.</strong>
    <p><p>I have to start out by saying, I am 100% against this tyranny!</p>
<p>But I have spent most of my life educating myself about history, technology, and yes, conspiracies... and I feel because of that time spent, I can see what’s coming clearer than most.. </p>
<p>This may be a little over the top, but its my opinion so don’t get your feeling hurt...</p>
<p>The elites (billionaires, globalists and robber baron families) have all come to the conclusion that there are too many humans.  And sadly, I no longer think they are wrong.  </p>
<p>The only way these 50 governors, and 330 world leaders would continue this non sense is if they have a legitimate (secret) reason for continuing it. </p>
<p>I have no doubt most have been given the “talk” by their corporate superiors, and understand that the population growth must be slowed/stopped... 
and once again, they probably aren’t wrong. Sadly. </p>
<p>8 billion will soon become 50 billion in a relatively short time.<br>
I hate this reality, but i can not run from it. </p>
<p>And if this pandemic has proven ONE thing to me... 
WAY too many stupid people have been having WAY too many children.  </p>
<p>Look around lol. </p>
<p>Once again, I’m not happy about this, but it is our unfortunate reality.  </p>
<p>I’m convinced that the people in positions of power have decided to; ruin peoples lives in the short term, to avoid massive famines and chaos in future decades... all while gaining TOTAL control over the population, so it never happens again. 
This, to them, is seem as the lesser of two evils.<br>
(And hey, they’ll be fine lol)</p>
<p>This reduction in population will be administered by incorporating different drugs into the mandatory yearly/monthly vaccine.  Eventually leading to either massive deaths, or mass sterilization.<br>
On purpose. </p>
<p>The worst part is that, since everyone will eventually receive these “vaccines”, when people inevitably have negative side effects from them, they can invent a new virus that can be blamed for these effects, creating a new virus, that needs a new vaccine, pushing the agenda even further.<br>
They have already proven how easy it is to do this.  </p>
<p>The reason i feel this agenda to be inevitable is because we have become COMPLETELY dependent on strangers for our basic survival.  </p>
<p>I remember in college reading a letter written by leader of the leader of the dwindling “Shawnee” native tribe post colonization.</p>
<p>He wrote that he was saddened at the state of his tribe.  His people, who were once self sufficient, had since become dependent on the europeans for everything.  Clothing, alcohol, weaponry, food, etc... 
This was his reason that his tribe was wiped out.  Not because the evil white man gave them small pox (which did happen), but because his people CHOSE luxury and convenience over independence.  </p>
<p>This exact thing has happens to all societies across the globe today.  Only a very small percentage of people are 100% self sufficient. </p>
<p>In other words.. THEY HAVE US BY THE BALLS! </p>
<p>But this is also the reason there are too many people. Mega farms, modern medicine, technology, and welfare make high populations possible.  It rewards bad behavior.  </p>
<p>Now that we are all mostly dependent, eliminating small businesses drives the final nail in the coffin.. making us FULLY dependent. </p>
<p>Now we all are forced to rely on a few corporations for everything, and laws become irrelevant.<br>
Corporations are our new UNELECTED government.  </p>
<p>Once again, sad but true.  </p>
<p>This leads me to my final point.  </p>
<p>Technology. </p>
<p>Over the past two decades tech has transformed life in ways never thought possible. 
Everyone (including myself) now has a phone connected permanently to the internet, and in most cases, we are UNABLE to even remove the battery if we want lol.<br>
Although i enjoy this technology, I’ve been growing to resent it more and more by the year.  </p>
<p>This exponential growth in tech is unstoppable, even if we resisted.  But i’m convinced NO ONE will resist if it means giving up their phone.<br>
So expect more spying, more tracking, and more mental manipulation from your black mirror for many years to come.  </p>
<p>The fact that people are so lazy they’ve purchased amazon Alexas so they can listen to music and have food delivered “hands free” is demoralizing. </p>
<p>Thats all it took to spy on us in our homes lol. 
And for those who say “i don’t have anything to hide”, you DO NOT understand how big data works.</p>
<p>Of course “they” don’t care about what porn you watch, but “they” do care about collecting mass data and putting it all into algorithms that can accurately predict human behavior. All the way down to the time you shit everyday, and all the way up to how many people will protest/resist this incoming tyranny.</p>
<p>Now, I know this rant is long and probably too “dramatic”, but i call it how i see it.<br>
And i feel this is one of the few places on the internet left where people may have the interest and intelligence to hear it.</p>
<p>Now for the optimism. </p>
<p>On the bright side, i no longer fear the thought of being forced to get the vaccine....</p>
<p>...Not because i think it will end the lockdowns and masks, (it won’t),  but because i am welcoming a shorter life span.  </p>
<p>I cannot foresee a future where we ever go back to that “old freedom” people enjoyed for the past century and before. </p>
<p>Considering I am middle aged (34) I am going to be a part of the “half generation” that remembers the “old way”, while being forced to live my remaining days in a much shittier fashion called “ the new normal”. </p>
<p>Young children will not know what they are missing, and older people will soon be gone.  (See nursing homes). </p>
<p>That is why I welcome a shorter life span. </p>
<p>Death sadly is the only way out of this hell hole.  And although I am not suicidal, I no longer dread death. <br>
It’s quite a liberating realization.<br>
I will now be living more “in the moment” because i had forgotten..
...it is all we actually have.  </p>
<p>So my advice would be to enjoy the little things.. and try to provide as much of the necessities for yourself as possible.<br>
Food, water, shelter and love.  </p>
<p>All the drones will keep their head in the sand, but deep down they are TERRIFIED of death, and think this life is as good as it gets.  A slave to fear.<br>
Especially the rich people who did horrible things to other people to amass their wealth. </p>
<p>My conscience is clean, and i’m ready for whatever comes our way.  </p>
<p>I wish you all the best, and am now deleting Reddit, and will be replacing it with meditation.</p></p>

        <p>Very good post. Wish you all the best.</p>
<p>Conquering the fear of death is paramount. We have very little control on the world, all we can control is how we react to the world.</p>
<p>PS. Anybody who thinks we have great control of our lives, please stop paying tax for a year or try to board an airplane without security checks. You'll find out very quickly how much control you have.</p>

        <p>Thank you so much for a thought-provoking and informative post that was easy to read, using simple language that I can understand, without being wordy or using too many unnecessary adjectives. </p>
<p>Also thanks for breaking it up into small paragraphs! That’s a big deal for me. </p>
<p>I’m sad that the conclusion seems to be that the world needs reduction in population. But why? Wouldn’t a trend for smaller families suffice?</p>
<p>Where I live, people have kids that shouldn’t, meaning they are not even self supporting, let alone family supporting . They have these kids so they can qualify for more government aid, and then they half-ass raise them so they become like their parents and it keeps a cycle going . </p>
<p>Isn’t there a way this exploitation could be ended, thereby contributing to a lower birthrate?</p>
<p>Also you say the vaccine won’t end lockdowns or masks. Again, what’s the  reasoning?</p>
<p>You say you’ll have a shorter life span but what does this mean exactly? Will everyone from here on out have a shorter life span? If so why?</p>
<p>Do I sound like a 4 year old child with all my why questions?  Lol.</p>
