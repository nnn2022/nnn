    <strong>Why I, as a COVID skeptic, am taking the vaccine</strong>
    <p><p><em>tldr: I came to the conclusion that voluntary vaccination does not necessarily conflict with skepticism about mainstream narratives concerning the pandemic of the last year and that it is a reasonable choice for such individuals.</em></p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This sub labels its membership as "free thinkers", and I have appreciated it as someone who considers myself as such. True thought freedom does not simply mean blindly rejecting mainstream narratives and orthodoxies, but rather constant examination, including of one's own views. This is merely a journal of my own thoughts on one aspect of the pandemic and its response, offered for the consideration of others who wish to come to an independent and rational conclusion. It is <strong>NOT</strong> an attempt to convince or coerce. It is not an invitation to debate, and I will not use it as such. It is not even laying out a suggestion for others' processing of the choices we each ought to be free to make. Only a chronicle of my own decision-making, in the hopes it will help others who are questioning not only the enforced mainstream narratives, but also the ones enforced here.</p>
<p><strong>My bona fides:</strong> Everyone here, whether you realize it or not, exists on a spectrum. I think most of you would recognize my own point of view. I have flatly rejected the credibility of the media since long before the virus was made in a lab in China. I believe crippling economic sabotage was done to take down Trump. While I don't fully buy in, I think the theories about forcing a "Great Reset" through the pandemic response have merit. I find Bill Gates supremely creepy and perhaps an enemy of humanity. I do understand that high-quality masks are effective, though minimally, at preventing the spread of diseases such as COVID, but I strongly oppose mask mandates. COVID itself is clearly much less dangerous than we were initially led to believe, though it is worse in severity and transmissability than the flu. I oppose any and all public health measures as illegitimate seizures of power, which I don't believe will be lifted until people demand they be lifted. And I think the response of public health officials, particularly their failure to communicate, has resulted in countless tens, maybe hundreds, of thousands of needless deaths, and that field should never be taken seriously again.</p>
<p>All of which is to say, I am one of you.</p>
<p><strong>MY REASONS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Initial reasons for rejecting the vaccine and what changed</strong></p>
<p><strong>The vaccine is experimental; it hasn't been properly tested or approved.</strong> I voted for Trump; I found him to be one of the greatest presidents of the last 100 years. But still.... would anyone trust this guy to hand you a bandaid, much less invent a heretofore-impossible vaccine? Again, I like him and all, but the idea of him in a white coat doesn't exactly inspire confidence, particularly when he's saying he'll do it fast and cheap.</p>
<p>What I learned since the initial roll-out is that the product itself was tested. It received all the same testing that any other product receives. The multiple tests were just done concurrently rather than sequentially. The relevant technologies have been tested for nearly 14 months now. The experiment is over. They've been shown to be just about as safe as any other vaccine (and yes, I'll come to J&amp;J). They've been shown to be astonishingly effective, as has been seen in Israel and states where the lockdowns and mandates have been lifted as vaccines become available.</p>
<p>And even if it is experimental, I've always thought it would be exciting to be part of a medical trial. Until you die horribly. Shrug.</p>
<p><strong>It's gene therapy!</strong> I don't like people talking about DNA, and mRNA sounds pretty similar. But from what I've since read, gene therapy is an actual change to the DNA of the human, where this is an alteration to the protein manufacture in certain cells, and only these cells. There is no long-term alteration to the body.</p>
<p><strong>Bill Gates is creepy.</strong> From what I've seen, he hasn't had any agency in creating the vaccine, and the worldwide competition in vaccine research and manufacture prevents any monopoly that would enable truly nefarious use of the medication outside of truly deep conspiracies which would invalidate the whole of modern medical science.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons for taking the vaccine</strong></p>
<p><strong>I don't want COVID.</strong> Yes, I'll probably survive it like I've survived every cold I've ever had. But I didn't like having a cold. And while, again, it almost certainly wouldn't kill or hospitalize me, if I could have taken a shot to prevent my last cold, I would have. By all indications, it is a nasty illness. I don't want to lose out on a month of work or even stay away from elderly people (with whom I work) for 10 days.</p>
<p><strong>PARAMOUNT REASON: IT INVALIDATES THE RESTRICTIONS.</strong> Personally, my biggest source of anger over the past year has been the arbitrary and dictatorial restrictions placed on people by public and private officials who care nothing for liberty or accountability. What has happened is a disgrace, and people need to stand up against it. According to the media narratives, the vaccine is a wonder drug which will bring an end to the pandemic - yet we see Biden saying shit like "the only way this ends is if everyone wears a mask," or Fauci saying vaccinated people should not go to restaurants. They're actively trying to shit on the vaccines and discourage people from using them. That's why they pulled J&amp;J.</p>
<p><strong>UNDERSTAND THIS: THEY DO NOT WANT THIS TO EVER END.</strong> That is my key point I want you all to take away.</p>
<p>We - you who agree with me about the illegitimacy of lockdowns, masks, and everything else - CANNOT oppose this stuff. We don't have enough power. But the higher the number of vaccinated rises, the more the average people - not the doomers and branch covidians, but the people who don't like this stuff but go along with it in the name of safety - will start to question why life isn't returning to a TRUE NORMAL. And they will join us in demanding it. They will join us in not complying. But they're going to need a reason, and the vaccine is the reason. Again, I'm not saying you have to do it. But for me, this wound up damn compelling.</p>
<p><strong>Objections that I still have</strong></p>
<p><strong>Vaccine passports.</strong> This concept is evil. I accept that it's reasonable to require vaccination to enter another country. For this now to happen in first-world countries is weird, but not novel. But this idea of requiring proof of vaccination to eat in a restaurant is insane and evil. There is even talk of including in such data an accounting of the individual's spreading of "misinformation". This is going to go the way of the Chinese Social Credit Score. It needs to be resisted. It's one of the key reasons I was unwilling to get the shot. It worries me about going in for it. From what I've seen, while activists, extremists, and covidians are clamoring for it, generally Democrat politicians have not been quick to move on this, and Republican governors are standing up against it. If we can keep this highly controversial, I think we can stop it, but I really don't blame anyone rejecting the vaccine to prevent this.</p>
<p><strong>Vaccine culture.</strong> People are sharing too much shit these days. It's no one else's business what you put in your body. Stop posting pictures of your cards. Stop talking to me about your vaccine. I told my boss I wasn't going to get it, and that if I did, it was none of his business. He just asked whether I was comfortable doing my duties without it, and I said I already am, and that was the end of it. But he shouldn't have been asking in the first place (though I accept it was out of genuine good intentions).</p>
<p><strong>Objections I reject</strong></p>
<p><strong>The vaccine is dangerous!</strong> So is every medicine. I've had bad side effects from run-of-the-mill vaccines that everyone but facebook moms in Sonoma takes. Johnson and Johnson was pulled over literally a chance in a million of potential interaction with a drug that ALREADY caused that particular side effect. We've spent the past year rightly screaming at people that COVID is a 0.03% chance of death. I'm not going to hide in my basement from a side effect that hasn't even manifested in my gender.</p>
<p><strong>It doesn't stop COVID from spreading!</strong> Of course it does. It creates antibodies against COVID, which kills the virus upon exposure. That's how our immune system works, that's why people only get sick with it once (typically). The virus spreads to others through reproduction in the body and expulsion through symptoms. If the virus is killed by antibodies, it cannot reproduce. If it doesn't reproduce, it can't cause symptoms. If it doesn't cause symptoms, it doesn't spread. Period. This is a lie started by the CDC. That's not an organization I'm listening to anymore.</p>
<p><strong>You're stupid/a shill!</strong> This is a troll account, and any perusal of my comment history will show I've racked up the downvotes saying what I think, including lots of shitting on doomers, sheep, and branch covidians. And several people on our side, but I'm equal-opportunity. As for being stupid, sure, I'm clearly an idiot. And as an idiot, these ideas convinced me to take this action. The ideas themselves are neither stupid or smart. They are only ideas, and any person, smart or stupid, can evaluate them and act accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>They'll make you get boosters three times a year!!</strong> I'm not going to take them. Admittedly, most of my arguments for the vaccine could be made in favor of boosters, so it's not a totally frivolous objection. But again, for me, the most motivating reason is to put a swift end to the popular acceptance of lockdowns and masking, and completing vaccination for this pandemic seems to be the most effective way to combat the culture of fear that prolongs these illiberal and evil policies.</p>
<p><strong>You'll still get COVID!!!</strong> Maybe. I've heard of that happening, from the same people who told me the military would enforce martial law in February. Literally every person I know except me has been immunized, and not one has gotten COVID since. But then, I also don't know a single person who's died of COVID or even with it - though I do know people who know people. And again, if I get it, I'll survive it.</p>
<p>This is long. Maybe no one will read it. Maybe you'll just downvote without reading. That's what this account is for, anyway. But maybe it will help someone. Not to get the vaccine, but to form their own independent conclusions about it and the wider issues we face.</p>
<p><strong>YOU ARE A FREE PERSON. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR YOURSELF ABOUT YOUR OWN HEALTH. NO ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO FORCE YOU TO UNDERGO A TREATMENT. GOD BLESS THE FREE THINKERS!</strong></p></p>

        <p>Uh-huh. 
Thanks to people like you, all of us will be forced. To drive up the numbers and because the majority is taking it no questions ask, having the carrot dangled in front of them that it will make restrictions obsolete, the number of people deciding against is small enough to crush. </p>

        <p>Up to you.   Hope you'll be ok.  I'm not sure if you're trying to convince others or yourself.</p>
<p>I totally disagree with you on almost all of your points.  A few examples:</p>
<p>The CDC didn't make the statements that it doesn't confer immunity first.  The manufacturers did.  Their trials specifically state it prevents illness, not transmission.   I would not consider you immunized.</p>
<p>We can oppose this.  I will oppose it to the death if I have to.  We have more power than they do.   Their power is an illusion propped up by media.</p>
<p>Not all 'medicines' are equally dangerous.   The dangers of the kovid shots far outweigh any medical benefits.   </p>
<p>It is called gene therapy because it changes how your cells function.  It tricks them into producting a protein they were not meant to create.   There is no certainity how long they will continue to create that protein, or what DNA might be activated by it's creation.</p>
<p>Finally, saying you're a troll doesn't help your arguements at all.  Maybe you're just trying to be clever here.   Either way, it doesn't work.</p>

        <p>Interesting points, and worth considering. Honestly, I may back out still.</p>
<p>I'll just push back on the opposition thing. There is a mindset common here (not that you're evincing it) that there are two groups of people in the world: the ones getting dragged out of CVS vs. everyone who's ever worn a mask in their lives. That simply isn't true.</p>
<p>There are those people. There are people who don't wear it but will put one on it directly asked. There are people who think having a nose out is a middle finger to the man. There are people like me who go without when able. There are those who rip it off as soon as they leave the store. And so on and so on, up to the people driving around with three masks.</p>
<p>It's like that for masks, it's like that for lockdowns and capacity requirements and schools and every issue.</p>
<p>If "my side" consists of the California Facebook moms and a few Gadsden flag people like me, we're not going to accomplish anything. But we aren't alone. There are people who see this as the absurdity it is. They won't join our next storming of this building or that, but they are going to ask questions. "Why do I have to wear a mask if I'm vaccinated? Why is my church still only online? Why does this restaurant have plastic everywhere? Why can't I shake hands with a vaccinated person?" And the higher that "vaccinated" number gets, the more people are going to ask that, and the more absurd the restrictions will look. And the more pressure that will be on private and public officials to return to a proper normal.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, I think the combativeness on our side (which IS a reaction to the hostility of the branch covidians) is cutting us off from seeing how many allies we do have out there. My message to us is that we have the ability to convince others - not that it takes the same action I'm doing, but at least point to the vax numbers and ask, does this make sense??</p>
<p>My message to anyone who wants to flaunt their vaccination is: throw away those damn masks and live your life. And if someone stands in your way, ask yourself why that is.</p>

        <p>There are not really 'sides'.  There are just people making choices in a ridiculous situation.</p>
<p>The people in charge keep wanting to herd us into 'sides' so we argue about trivial things.   </p>
<p>I would guess that only about 20% of the population (at best) is really pro-mRNA-shot.   And about 20% like me who would die before taking it.   The other 60% waiver in the middle.   They don't really care about it one or the other and just want to get on with life.  </p>
<p>I am not looking for allies.   I don't expect to convince anyone one way or another.  The Faucian people cannot be swayed by facts or numbers.   They will take a million injections and wear masks till they die.  The middle 60% will wake up when their redlines are hit.  I just hope it's not too late.</p>
<p>I am here to let the 20% of actively resisting people know that they are not alone.</p>

        <p>Wow this is definitely a paid promotional post by pharma.  Here's why I will never get the mRNA:  This tech was never approved for nearly 30 years due to serious, documented  issues which are available for all to research on Pub Med. Coronavirus vaccines specifically are worrisome in terms of ADE.  ( Can you say "Dengvaxia?" )  Biggest reason:  I developed blood clot in my right thigh following hep B vaccine, which broke off.. travelled to my brain while I was cooking breakfast one morning... causing me to collapse and have a stroke at the grand old age of 21.... This caused brain damage and loss of movement my right hand, it took me about a decade to recover.  Sorry Pharma but you can't talk people out of their own life experience.....  Now it seems more and more people are having their own experiences with these new mRNA "vaccines.."</p>

        <p>It doesn't stop covid from spreading. Don't you find it funny that places that are getting the vaccine  in large numbers also have cases skyrocketing in large numbers ? </p>
<p>Theres an argument where getting the vaccine will make you more susceptible to getting covid</p>

        <p>Hey, no one gets sick from covid except sick and old and people who are super out of shape, which is a lot of Americans.</p>
<p>I understand your frustration, but no liberals and average scared people will listen to you. They are completely brainwashed.</p>
<p>I’ll take the vaccine to go overseas and meet my family. Vaccine is not for virus. It’s just for social acceptance.</p>
<p>The point is that there is a large group of people who would do anything to prove they are right, so we gotta roll with them. Really, you don’t need to care about the virus. It’s the people. And we should take vaccine to get them out of the way even if it means feeding the filthy pharmaceutical companies and politicians. Okay?</p>
