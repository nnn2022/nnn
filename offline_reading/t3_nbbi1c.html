    <strong>Terrified after having been around jabbed people</strong>
    <p><p>Two days ago I went to get a haircut and my hair dresser had both jabs. My time there lasted about nearly two hours. I felt like a dumb doomer but in reverse but I wore not one, but TWO masks because I was so scared of potentially inhaling the vaccine, or spike proteins or whatever. I really really hope that I didn’t get second handedly get vaccinated. Is that even possible? Anyway, after that was done I went to grocery store and was in there for about maybe two hours. Not many people in there but I’m sure at least some of them were jabbed. I’ve been seeing countless horror stories of the unvaxxed feeling sick and weird and having what seems like be side effects of the jab without having actually getting it, just by being around jabbed people. It’s really fucking scaring me and I’ve even been losing sleep over it. I’m only 22 and I have my whole fucking life ahead of me! I have plans and dreams, I really don’t want to fucking die a torturous painful death especially at such a young age. Even some doctors have been speaking out about vaccine shedding and how dangerous it is. It’s been eating me alive. We all know that you can’t detox from this jab, it’s in you forever and there’s nothing you can about it. Well who knows maybe in the future we’ll find ways that will actually help people get it out of their bodies and heal again. I like to believe anything is possible. I have been praying to God every single day to protect me from the jabbed and to put a protective barrier around to where the shedding will never affect me. But still I’m really scared. Am I been paranoid and overthinking it?</p></p>

        <p>I still don't know how spreading of proteins would work through the air. Trying to understand the theoretical science behind it, but I feel like this is a psyop within the psyop at this moment. Supporting indirectly the false premise of "infectiousness", which is a germ theory based lie, in support of the fake virus in the end.</p>
<p>Rule 1: fear is never good. Stay rational, focused, sober, healthy. Eat well, hydrate, stop using alcohol, drugs. Sleep. And spend your time learning about the truth in this world, which you rightly concluded, means also the reality of God, and get solid footing in the truth, and the Bible, to be able to wither this storm. Because if you're terrified right now, you'll be paralyzed and crawling on the floor in a couple of years. It's only gonna get worse.</p>
<p>N.B. you will die one day. Better start to thinkg how to get on the good side of the afterlife. God can help us, but there will be blood, especially of Christians, also because they are the biggest resisters of the tyranny. Where God rules, there is freedom. Where Satan rules, there is tyranny.  God bless.</p>
