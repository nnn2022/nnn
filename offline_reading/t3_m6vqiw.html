    <strong>I am not an Anti-Vaxxer</strong>
    <p><p>I took the 12 Vaccines, that i should take &amp; if i look my Vaccine Passport 10 Years ago: there are all Vaccines from the State. The last Vaccine i took, was 2011 against Hepatitis C &amp; Whooping Cough. I do vaccinate my children against Measels, Whopping Cough, Tetanus...</p>
<p>When i look at the Covid Vaccines, i am not so sure: i mean there are from Companies, i never heard off &amp; it is like i would say from diffrent Companies: „Wich brand of Cola i should take?“</p>
<p>Because there are 1000 brands of Cola &amp; don’t know wich is the best. But the Major brands: Coca Cola, Pepsi, RC Cola, Dr.Pepper or the Budget Cola..</p>
<p>Excuse me, with all Respects, but for me: this is just like, choosing wich Brand of Cola should i drink. Really don’t know which of them is really good.</p></p>

        <p>I used to have a positive opinion on vaccines, but the industry and society have now poisoned me on the idea.  There has been an aggressive almost satanic marketing push to coerce people to take these new vaccines.  It is claimed that because all previous vaccines are miracle cures and perfectly safe and that since these gene therapy drugs are being called vaccines they are safe too.  </p>
<p>Also any discussion around vaccine safety leads to name calling defamation and censorship. That is a big red flag to me. Turns out there has been a big effort to suppress research into vaccine harm, most safety studies are not actually so convincing and there have been a number of vaccines that caused injuries over the decades.</p>
<p>By creating a captive customer base of ever expanding childhood Vax schedules you can turn big profits. Companies that engage in predatory marketing is never in the consumers best interest.</p>

        <p>I remember seeing when I was in the doctor's office for kids a sign for a cancer vaccine that said something like "if you could prevent your kid from getting cancer, wouldn't you do it?" and then a picture of a kid, I thought it was dirty</p>

        <p>They prey on emotions heavily but offer little in the way of solid information. Many doctors don't actually know the contents of the vaccines they administer, they've just been told they are safe and good for you. </p>
<p>Since the regulatory bodies are in bed with the Pharma companies and everyone is relying on the top down approval structure their is an opportunity for abuse. Especially when you consider the money involved.</p>

        <p>I will take the Pfizer one if I'll be given a choice, because they say I'll be able to log in to Windows 10 without entering a password. It's convenient, I hate that our IT makes us change our passwords every 90 days, and then purge all cached credentials in configuration manager, and then 2FA.. Just be able to turn on the computer and start working - would be very convenient.</p>

        <p>You shouldn't take the AstraZeneca. There is no specific evidence that it's bad, but there are a lot of clues that it could. I would recommend Pfizer, since that's the one who gives the most immunity.</p>
