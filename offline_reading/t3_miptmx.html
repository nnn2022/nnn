        <p>It’s incredibly frustrating that no large business has changed its policy so that they only require masks where state/local regulations call for them. The systematic nature of it needs to be rectified through the legislature or the courts.</p>

        <p>Look I'm on your side, but this completely contradicts everything that we support. If a business enforces masks in a place without a mandate, it can just compete with those that don't enforce it. Businesses should have a right to have anti-consumer policies. When we say that Law is higher than all this, we pretty much become authoritarian like the covid religion followers</p>

        <p>But it can't go against a medical exemption for a mask.  That would be illegal.  It's illegal for a store to make someone wear a mask or leave once that person declares medical exemption.  It's also illegal for people to yell, scream, insult, taunt, bar passage, or harass people for not wearing masks for any reason.  That is assault.  Assault is illegal.</p>

        <p>Yes it can. No it would not. It would be an ADA concern for later investigation,  and as far as police are concerned, "yell, scream, insult, taunt, bar passage, or harass people" ...that is a civil or criminal offense (I'm not a lawyer). They  would ask YOU to leave. Regardless of the situation it arises from,  (the parties participating in the situation), they are privately owned (the business) Also, there is NO medical exemptions from wearing a mask or anything of the like for the normal person entering a private business. You MUST have a doctors orders to be truly exempt. I'll explain with the (CDC link below). THEY have the right to refuse service to anyone. AT ANYTIME. No matter the situation. It states so on the sign (assuming they have one posted, if otherwise it's a different issue (legally). YOU have the right to deny that. YOU have the right to not obey. THEY have the right to enforce it. (Although not always correct, respected or generally accepted). This is freedom of speech and civil action. That does not change the law. It is freedom of THEIR rights, AND yours.</p>
<p>Disability Exemptions of the Order</p>
<p>Who is covered by the exemption for “a person with a disability who cannot wear a mask, or cannot safely wear a mask, because of the disability as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Actexternal icon (ADA, 42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.)”?</p>
<p>Most people, including those with disabilities, can tolerate and safely wear a mask and are required to wear one as per CDC’s Order. However, certain people with disabilities who, because of their disability, cannot wear a mask, or cannot safely wear a mask, are exempted from CDC’s mask-wearing requirement.</p>
<p>The exemption is not meant to cover people with disabilities for whom wearing a mask might only be difficult or whose disability does not prevent them from wearing a mask or wearing a mask safely.</p>
<p>The following narrow subset of persons with disabilities are exempt from CDC’s requirement to wear a mask:</p>
<p>A person with a disability who, for reasons related to the disability, would be physically unable to remove a mask without assistance if breathing becomes obstructed. Examples might include a person with impaired motor skills, quadriplegia, or limb restrictions</p>
<p>A person with an intellectual, developmental, cognitive, or psychiatric disability that affects the person’s ability to understand the need to remove a mask if breathing becomes obstructed</p>
<p>The following persons with disabilities might be exempt from CDC’s requirement to wear a mask based on factors specific to the person:</p>
<p>A person with a disability who cannot wear a mask because it would cause the person to be unable to breathe or have respiratory distress if a mask were worn over the mouth and nose. A person with a condition that causes intermittent respiratory distress, such as asthma, likely does not qualify for this exemption because people with asthma, or other similar conditions, can generally wear a mask safely.</p>
<p>A person with a disability requiring the use of an assistive device, such as for mobility or communication, that prevents the person from wearing a mask and wearing or using the assistive device at the same time. If use of the device is intermittent and the person can remove the mask independently to use the device, then a mask must be worn during periods when the person is not using the device.</p>
<p>A person with a severe sensory disability or a severe mental health disability who would pose an imminent threat of harm to themselves or others if required to wear a mask. Persons who experience discomfort or anxiety while wearing a mask without imminent threat of harm would not qualify for this exemption.</p>

        <p>Yes. I don't claim to be knowledgeable of the law. Private business does have the right to refuse service to anyone. They have a sign. That's freedom of speech. If you didn't read, that's the point. You're act of being civil does not change the law. We thank you for being respectful and leaving. This post is targeted at people that feel oppressed when asked to follow a simple rule to protect others. That's it. "Be nice to others and treat others as you would like to be treated" . Just because they don't "feel" like it applies to them. It does. They are the first to cry out when someone THEY know dies. Fuck all of you. Downvote me. People die because OF YOU.</p>

        <p>&rt;Could you explain how this person is not accurately representing medical discrimination law? I actually talked to my lawyer about this the other day out of curiosity and she said generally the same thing.</p>
<p>The order from the CDC is solely in regards to public conveyance, e.g. airplanes, trains, ferries, etc. It is a completely separate scenario from private businesses, which is what this entire thread is about.</p>
<p>For the executive orders as they pertain to places of business, it will vary for every single state. But generally speaking, most states have similar verbiage when it comes to mask mandates (if they even still have mask mandates at all), and the verbiage is generally to the effect of: as a patron in a place of business, you don't have to wear a mask if you are medically unable, and you don't need to divulge the specific medical condition that exempts you.</p>
<p>For instance, here is the executive order in New Jersey:</p>
<ol>
<li>Require workers and customers to wear cloth face coverings while in the indoor portion of the premises, <strong>except where doing so would inhibit that individual’s health</strong> or where the individual is under two years of age, and require workers to wear gloves when in contact with customers or goods. Businesses must provide, at their expense, such face coverings and gloves for their employees. If a customer refuses to wear a cloth face covering for non-medical reasons and if such covering cannot be provided to the individual by the business at the point of entry, then the business must decline the individual entry into the indoor premises. If the business is providing medication, medical supplies, or food, the business policy should provide alternate methods of pickup and/or delivery of such goods for such individual. Nothing in the stated policy should prevent workers or customers from wearing a surgical-grade mask or other more protective face covering if the individual is already in possession of such equipment, or if the business is otherwise required to provide such worker with more protective equipment due to the  9 nature of the work involved. <strong>Where an individual declines to wear a face covering in the indoor premises due to a medical condition that inhibits such usage, neither the essential retail business nor its staff shall require the individual to produce medical documentation verifying the stated condition.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In Massachusetts:</p>
<p>&rt;Where a person is unable to wear a mask or cloth face covering due to a medical or disabling condition; <strong>provided that a person who declines to wear a mask or cloth face covering because of a medical or disabling condition shall not be required to produce documentation verifying the condition</strong></p>
<p>You can go state by state and find similar verbiage. The person above quoting the CDC is wrong. So is your lawyer.</p>

        <p>The argument is that private businesses must have the right to discriminate against those who refuse to wear masks. Medical exemption or not is irrelevant. We are not supposed to be authoritarians, we are supposed to be liberals.</p>
<p>\&rt; It's illegal for a store to make someone wear a mask or leave once that person declares medical exemption.</p>
<p>Yeah mask mandates are also legal. Just because something is legal does not mean it's moral. The argument is that it should be legal for a store to only allow mask wearers in their property.</p>

        <p>So in your area the laws say that businesses must be forced to allow those who don't wear masks, under bullshit excuse such as "medical exemption"? Sounds just as authoritarian as Leftists are. The fact that you LIKE such laws make you a Leftist authoritarian too, the very ones who I presume you'd love to criticize.</p>

        <p>Good question. I probably wasn't clear enough, but the post was idolizing "the law" as if it was tied to morality or something. I just think that's a dangerous place to go, so I would let businesses implement draconian rules to deter customers away.

        <p>It's a great theory, and probably technically correct, but sadly that isn't the most important version of correct.  Stores are currently doing this, governors are fining them if they DON'T violate these laws, and if you don't leave when asked, you CAN be arrested for trespassing.</p>
<p>It turns out that emergency orders can do whatever they want, violating any laws or constitutional amendments, and while it might fall apart later, you're still screwed now.</p>

        <p>This is all incorrect unfortunately. Stores are doing this but they are in violation of the law by doing so. Governors are making policies (not laws) that <em>threaten</em> fines. Most businesses aren’t willing to go to court over it so they comply, this does not make something lawful.</p>
<p>Trespass is a secondary offense. You must have committed a crime to be trespassed from a public accommodation. Doing otherwise would be discriminatory.</p>
<p>While you cannot be arrested, in some situations officers will request that you do leave. Unfortunately a persons only recourse at that point is to file a civil suit in federal court which all of us should be doing every time we are refused service. </p>
<p>Please stop misinforming people about their rights. You are helping the tyrants.</p>

You will be accosted, you may have the cops called, and the cop may arrest you.  You can fight it in court, but that takes a great deal of time, effort, and money, and this places the onus on you.</p>
<p>An executive order can order stores to call the cops on people who aren't masked for whatever reason, even if it violates the law.  They only have problems if and when someone challenges them.  This is essentially the problem, the onus is on the population to fight these illegal orders, but until they do, they are enforced as if they were just.</p>
<p>It's great to say these orders are illegal, and I agree, but until a judge with authority and muscle to actually get them thrown out is involved and does so, they're on the books, and you will face the consequences as if they were legitimate.</p>

        <p>I mean they can make rules,  they can state no shirt no shoes no service. They can say no mask.  They are not doing any bdiscrimination against your skin color. Same as saying well I want to go into the store after a hours when it's closed, or I want to go into vip for free at a club because it's a public event.  Try walking into a Costco meeting room and staying or the bank vault in a Costco,  or the bakery. You can't.  But if Costco said yeah you can come in to our bakery if you wear a mask for protection to the food then you could.  You can't say it's my right,  because no it's a food safety thing.  And if they ask you to leave for any of the reasons and you say no then you are trespassing.</p>

        <p>“No shirt, no shoes, no service” is a public standard all businesses are allowed to impose. This means they are allowed to expect someone to be reasonably dressed. A mask is not a matter of reasonable dress, it is a medical device. This is well beyond the scope of “no shirt, no shoes, no service.”</p>
<p>“They are not doing any discrimination against your skin color.” I know. I’m sure I never said they were.</p>
<p>I can’t engage with this kind of discourse. Sorry. You’re simply being unreasonable. All your metaphors are dramatic misrepresentations of what is happening in reality. </p>
<p>Trespassing is a secondary offense, like you aren’t even willing to do basic research and realize you totally and blatantly wrong about that. You can’t ask someone to leave a store because they are too tall or too short, or “any reason” like you say. You can’t. It’s law.</p>

        <p>Under American law, a business owner has the right to refuse service to some customers. But federal and a lot of state laws say you can't discriminate against customers based on factors such as race, religion, sex or national origin.
Costco wrote it into their contract that you need a mask to have a membership.  Having a "medical condition " that requires a mask is not under ADA either.</p>

        <p>When I was bartending, I could refuse to serve anyone for any reason and didn’t owe them any explanation. We were explicitly instructed NOT to give a reason because that’s when you get in trouble legally. I couldn’t refuse to serve a pregnant woman and tell her that was the reason or it could be considered discrimination. Unfortunately, if someone wanted to refuse a certain race then there’s nothing that customer could do unless the store said it was because of their race. </p>
<p>You have no bill of rights on public property, however you must follow the laws of the land. You don’t have freedom of speech in a Target anymore than you have it in my living room. If I ask you to leave, you’re out, and I nor Target owes you an explanation.</p>

        <p>Yep yep it’s a company that bought said land, owns the land and building on said land making it private property, and has every right to refuse service to anyone they want.

        <p>Owning the land is not indicative of a private business. A public accommodation can operate on private land. Any business which opens its doors to public commerce becomes a public accommodation. Just look up the law. That’s life so get used to it cry baby!</p>
<p>Costco = “private business.” Need membership to enter. Pretty easy to tell the difference when you’re not ignorant.</p>
<p>I shop anywhere I want because I’m a free man and no one has authority over since I’ve not committed a crime. Businesses that refuse service to pro face folks deserve to be outed and sued for being the tyrants they are. Thanks for the unsolicited advice though. Cheers.</p>

        <p>Nope. The law states a “reasonable accommodation” must be made. Please be clear with your words, they are important when discussing the law. Asking me to use curbside service or something of the like is not a reasonable accommodation. If someone is scared of getting sick, it is more reasonable that they should use curbside or the like. It is an unreasonable act for a business to require 99.25% of the population to accommodate .75% of the population. HIGHLY unreasonable. </p>
<p>I appreciate your opinion that they are “acting within their legal rights,” but this simply is not true. A business has no right to give medical advice. That’s the simple truth.</p>
<p>There are many cases in court at the moment, but none have been settled yet that I am aware of. It will be big news when it finally happens.</p>

        <p>It's actually not my opinion, I'm with you -I think it's all fucked. But our opinions aren't what will hold up in court. Providing a delivery or curbside pick-up service is clearly their idea of an appropriate alternative. <br>
And if you're a healthy person with no medical condition how do you think that will hold up in court? If you have no valid proof that wearing a mask will harm you, do you really think you'll win the lawsuit?</p>

        <p>Slavery was legal. The Holocaust was legal. Your fucking "it's not legal" BS is the most anti-good, pro-evil stance you could take. A business has all the right in the world to do what it wants, as long as it does not initiate aggression, force, or coercion. Many laws are the definition of using threats as a problem-solving tool. Its barbaric. </p>

        <p>I don't agree with this argument. This is ironically a Leftist argument. This is the same argument that Colin Kaepernick and his advocates made that he should not be fired for kneeling on national anthem, because private businesses must have "restrictions".</p>
<p>The problem is not that businesses are enforcing mask mandates, the problem is that GOVERNMENT is enforcing mask mandates. There's absolutely nothing wrong in private businesses voluntarily enforcing mask mandates without government's requirement. Why? Because there will be some businesses who won't enforce mask mandates, customers will go there, and that will force all businesses to remove mask restrictions.</p>
<p>Oh, and btw, private businesses can be okay with fistfights as long as people entering there are consenting. It's called MMA, boxing, wrestling etc.</p>
<p>Oh, and btw, there's also nothing wrong with businesses discriminating based on gender. It happens all the time.</p>

<p>Oh and btw, any business which opens its doors for public commerce becomes a public accommodation. So, not a “private business.” Costco is Private. Costco requires a membership. Hope that clears things up.</p>

<p>I’m not a communist. Deflecting from the law with character attacks is childish. The law states that any business which opens its doors to public commerce becomes a public accommodation. Please educate yourself to the law and the definition of a business open for public commerce. Costco is a private business, they require membership. They are not open to public commerce. Safeway is open to public commerce. Jack in the box is open to the public commerce. These are two examples of <em>public accommodations.</em> Hope that helps you with your misunderstanding.</p>

<p>Is it? Is fine an emotional argument?</p>

<p>There's no character attack here. I'm actually accusing you as a communist.</p>
<p>&rt; any business which opens its doors to public commerce becomes a public accommodation.</p>
<p>One again that's a communist argument. Businesses are NEVER meant for public. They must have every right to deny customers entry for any reason they like. The only purpose of a business is to make profit, not to "serve" public.</p>
<p>&rt; Please educate yourself to the law and the definition of a business open for public commerce.</p>
<p>Our constitution protected property rights. If the law goes against our constitution, then the law is a communist law.</p>
<p>I know it hurts you a lot, but businesses must have every right to deny entry to people who refuse to wear masks. The only purpose of business is to make profit, not to give "accommodation" to the people they don't like.</p>

        <p>Yes, threats are about emotion and compliance. “You could be fined” is an emotional argument because it’s not backed by any sort of law.</p>
<p>Yes, you are accusing me, that is an argument concerning my character rather than the topic. That is a character attack.</p>
<p>Once again, not a communist argument it’s just the law. It’s actually not an argument at all, it’s the underlying fact of the situation. You’re unwillingness to accept it is holding this discourse back. Please look up the law concerning public accommodations.</p>
<p>Nope. A business can’t deny you service for any reason they like. It’s simply against the law. Please look up the civil rights act. Thanks.</p>
<p>Yep, constitution supersedes all. A business may operate on private property, this is true. Regardless of what or whose property the business is operating on, if it should open its doors to public commerce, it then becomes a public accommodation. The law is clear on this. You are confusing private property with a public accommodation <em>operating on private property.</em> I hope I’ve made this distinction clear.</p>
<p>I know it hurts you a lot, but people have rights, and businesses can’t violate those rights just because they “feel like it.” That’s why we have laws in place which protect individuals from unfair business practices. Thank you and have a good day.</p>

Everyone owns themselves which means everyone owns their labor, which means anyone can deny service/entry to their property for any reason.

        <p>I’m not making this left v right; this is authoritarian vs libertarian. Someone owns that property and can set whatever rules they want. They can ask you to get an anal swab before entering if they’d like, it’s <strong>their property</strong>. You are <strong>your own</strong> property and you can refuse to enter and refuse to do business. </p>
<p>Not too long ago, the argument was “private businesses can stay open if they’d like, and not require masks!”. Now it’s “businesses are public accommodations and can’t discriminate against me!”. You went from defending inalienable rights (which are human rights) to completely disregarding them. </p>
<p>“People can only do things I like, and the government should get involved!” is something both sides scream. This positive rights, two party, authoritarian bullsh(poop) is what’s destroying this country. Let people do whatever they wanna do with their property, period.</p>
<p>“Legally” nothing. Whenever the law is in your favor you’ll cling to it, whenever it’s not you’ll say it’s unconstitutional, and the other side does the same thing. Just stop trying to force your version of morality onto people. </p>
<p>TLTR: Arguing that someone should be forced to take your money or allow you onto their property is dumb.</p>
<p>Just leave people alone; stop trying to control everyone. Please.</p>

        <p>You are confusing private property with a public accommodation. They are two different things. Please look up the law, thanks.</p>
<p>I won’t engage with emotional arguments and exaggerations. This is a very specific argument and concerns the law. The law is specific in this regard. It has nothing to do with what I want or don’t want. It’s simply a discourse about the law. Again, the law is specific. Any business, operating on private property or not, which opens its doors to public commerce becomes a public accommodation. Please stop disregarding this. Thanks.</p>

<p>It’s not that I don’t want to wear a mask, it’s that I can’t. A business cannot legally make a policy that requires me to wear a medical device which harms me. The policy is, quite definitively, <em>against the law.</em> The condition of my health autonomy is protected by the ADA which is an extension of the civil rights act. Thanks.</p>

<p>Didn't say anything about that did I?</p>
<p>&rt;It’s not that I don’t want to wear a mask, it’s that I can’t.</p>
<p>Bullshit.  You've said previously that you could wear a mask, but you won't.  </p>
<p>You have also said you don't wash your hands.  You don't believe viruses are contagious, so there is no telling what other disgusting habits you have.  I certainly wouldn't want to be around you.</p>
<p>Also you are a flat earther, so nothing you say is in any way credible.</p>
<p>Again:  Not wanting to wear a mask is not a protected class.</p>
<p>The ADA lists the following reasonable modification to a mask policy that are acceptable to the ADA:</p>
<p>&rt;Allow customers to order online with curbside pick-up or no contact delivery in a timely manner;</p>
<p>&rt;Allow customers to order by phone with curb-side pick-up or no contact delivery in a timely manner;</p>
<p>Just because YOU don't think it's an acceptable accommodation, doesn't matter.  The ADA does.</p>
<p>Go ahead and file your civil lawsuit.  Others have tried, none have succeeded.</p>
<p>&rt;The first case regarding the ADA and face masks was decided on October 23, 2020 in the Federal District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>&rt;In the ruling, U.S. District Judge Nora Barry Fischer determined that the store’s face mask policy was a correct interpretation of the Pennsylvania Department of Health’s order that face masks are to be worn in public spaces and that those who cannot wear a face mask may instead wear a face shield. Giant Eagle noted in their defense that they had in place other modifications to policy and practice consistent with ADA Title III to accommodate customers with disabilities.</p>

        <p>I can’t wear a mask. A business is not lawfully making itself accessible to me by insisting I wear a mask when I cannot. Thus, the onus is on them to prove I am an <em>immediate threat</em> to the public. </p>
<p>Further, I never insisted that wearing a mask had anything to with race, color, religion, or national origin. So why would you ask me such a ridiculous question? I can see no reason for you to leave out specific context of what you quoted other than to be intentionally disingenuous. Change my mind if you’d like.</p>

        <p>You can wear a mask, you just choose not to big difference. I’m sorry, but I’m not sorry the law clearly says race,color,religion or national origin and even gender. </p>
<p>None of these above have anything to do with masks so this law you speak so much about does not protect you. </p>
<p>If anything them making you wear the mask is a Sanitation thing, in which they have every right to keep you out if you choose not to wear one. That’s the whole point of No shoes no shirt no service.  </p>
<p>And furthermore you’re insisting that masks have something to do with color, race, religion or national origin every time you bring up this public accommodation law. You may say it’s a health issue that keeps you from wearing the mask, but does this law say anything about health issues Nope no it doesn’t. The only  issues it covers is people with disabilities being able to get into said store like ramps and handicap parking stuff of that matter.  </p>
<p>And I’m not here to change your mind. I could really careless of you wear a mask or not. I’m here to call you out on being a whiner you sit on Reddit spouting the same thing over and over and over again like it going to change something. Guess what it’s not, instead of wasting your time here why don’t you get of google, bing, DuckDuckGo and find a store that doesn’t require mask and boom problem solved little buddy. And that would have saved you  hours of arguing with people over this and you could have been using that time to hang out with your friends, having a nice lunch or dinner with that food you bought. 
Unless you like sitting behind your computer/phone arguing with people for hours everyday do you? I mean if so you do you but that’s kinda sad.</p>

        <p>No I’m not. Please don’t try to slander me.  Why can’t you wear one? Health issues? I made my point with health issues in that statement. Stores have call in orders or online orders where you tell them what you need and someone gets it for you and even brings it out to you, boom problem solved again or like I said before find a store that doesn’t require a mask. Damn I’m good. The facts remain that there are so many solutions for your problem but yet you wanna whine about it on  Reddit. Why?

        <p>So, anyone who is scared of getting sick should utilize the services you describe. I don’t want to curbside shop, I want to shop in the store. Since they cannot prove I am immediate threat to anyone, that shouldn’t be a problem. The key phrase is “reasonable accommodation.” Doesn’t make sense for 99.25% of the population to wear masks just so .75% can walk in the grocery store. Makes more sense for those people to curbside shop! </p>

<p>The ADA does agree with me. It protects an individuals rights. A business does not have the right to enforce medical devices on people. The ADA also protects my right to health autonomy. The ADA cannot force me to wear a mask nor can it compel a business to force me to do so. You have to understand how the ADA interacts with the law in order to fully understand the situation.</p>

        <p>There has been no court proceeding to decide what a “reasonable accommodation” is. It is <em>unreasonable</em> for a business to ask healthy people to sacrifice their health for the small minority (.75% of the population) who might be affected. It is much more reasonable for a business to ask people terrified of a virus to use these services. </p>

        <p>&rt;There has been no court proceeding to decide what a “reasonable accommodation” is.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>&rt;The first case regarding the ADA and face masks was decided on October 23, 2020 in the Federal District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>&rt;In the ruling, U.S. District Judge Nora Barry Fischer determined that the store’s face mask policy was a correct interpretation of the Pennsylvania Department of Health’s order that face masks are to be worn in public spaces and that those who cannot wear a face mask may instead wear a face shield. Giant Eagle noted in their defense that they had in place other modifications to policy and practice consistent with ADA Title III to accommodate customers with disabilities.</p>
<p>If you feel so strongly about it, why haven't you filed your own suit?</p>
<p>&rt;It is unreasonable for a business to ask healthy people to sacrifice their health</p>
<p>Wearing a mask isn't "sacrificing your health".  </p>

        <p>Oh I did man up. And I know no one cares what I want that’s why I’m not crying about it on Reddit. I don’t wear a mask when I don’t have to and do when I need to. And I don’t get online to cry about it. But you do every single day. </p>
<p>And I do leave people alone, I have friends that refuse to wear masks And that’s fine I don’t care that is up to them but guess what they don’t whine about it when a store stops them from entering they’ll just find another store to go to, they don’t throw little temper tantrum like a child that doesn’t get their way. </p>
<p>But you don’t leave people alone do you? You post memes trying to make fun of people that do wear mask and comment on post about pro mask things leaving your anti mask opinion on it like anybody is going to care. Which makes you just like those pro mask people your all the same bunch of nobody’s that think that they’re something special. And not trolling I’m just calling you out for being a baby about it plane and simple ™️</p>
<p>And there is no right or wrong side of history on this, this isn’t some war that is good vs evil  you’re not some kinda of soldier fighting the good fight, you’re just some guy that’s it.</p>

        <p>Retail stores are private property just like your home. The employees there deal with a ton of customer bullshit under normal conditions. Now enter the nonsense of mask vs. non-mask customers. Whines if they do whines if they don’t.Those employees are required to wear them 8 to 12 hrs. A day. So get over yourselves wear a mask a few minutes get your shit and get out.</p>

        <p>That is not correct. Any busines law which opens its doors to public commerce becomes a public accommodation. Costco requires a membership, which means it is not open to public commerce. This makes it a private business. TJmaxx does not require a membership, thus it is a public accommodation. </p>
<p>Employees do not <em>have</em> to wear mask. They <em>choose</em> to. As do many customers. A person could choose to work somewhere else or refuse to wear a mask. Regardless there are choices to be made. </p>
<p>Wearing one for 10 minutes or 10 days isn’t the point. It’s a meaningless rule that I refuse to abide by. There is no reason to wear a mask, so asking me to wear one for 10 minutes is actually insane. </p>
<p>So get over yourself and learn the law. Thanks and have a good day.</p>

        <p>They are a public accommodation operating on private property, that is the distinction you are missing. They cannot have you removed without a good (legal) reason. A public accommodation cannot trespass someone purely because they don’t like them. That is an absurd misunderstanding of the law.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry you have not understood a thing I’ve tried to explain.  My statement was about the people that go into stores wanting to fight and argue over masks. The ones that shout and complain and enjoy causing problems. The employees don’t deserve getting yelled at for something they can’t control. Your lack of empathy speaks volumes and you have my pity.</p>

        <p>Not sure what the law is in America but I would be totally fine if a shop wants to refuse entry for someone if they're not wearing a mask. That's what a free country would look like. If someone thinks that there's a deadly disease going around and doesn't want anyone in their shop to enter without a mask, that should be their decision, as it's their property.</p>

        <p>The point is you should never have to give a reason for not allowing someone on your property. It's your property and your decision.</p>

        <p>They are designed to <em>seem</em> like laws, however they. Laws must be passed through a voting process. No one voted for any of the measures currently in place. Thus, they do not qualify as “laws” and are aptly named accordingly. “Mandates.” “Policies.” “Ordinances.” “Requirements.” All words that sound a lot like “law” but unfortunately are not the same.</p>

        <p>I'm on your side, but you have to agree with OP. A lot of us are using "medical exemption" excuse to not wear masks, and we all know that it's bullshit excuse we made up, that has no sound reasoning on science.</p>
<p>There's actually no medical situation where wearing mask would adversely affect you. You know it very well. The only correct argument for not wearing masks should be "my body, my choice", and not "medical exemption".</p>

        <p>If a mask gives you anxiety then that is an exemption. It’s that simple. If a mask makes it hard for someone to breathe you are exempt. Simple. It is extremely sound reasoning based on the law and has nothing to do with the scientific method.</p>
<p>People with asthma or other breathing conditions would heartily disagree with you. Masks are dangerous for everyone, regardless of whether they know it or not.</p>

        <p>Anxiety is not a "medical" condition, it's a psychological one. There's a remedy of anxiety, and it's called exposure. You should look it up if you're unaware.</p>
<p>Once again, "medical exemption" is not a valid argument against masks, because it's bullshit. You're using medical exemption laws, which are ironically Leftist laws.</p>

        <p>Wearing a mask is for the protection of everyone, when has it not been society's job to be safe and be civil. There are no medical conditions that could prevent you from being able to wear a mask, not wven asthma. Why would it even matter if it wasn't your responsibility, wearing a mask really doesn't harm you or inconvenience you in any way other than buying it and remembering to grab before going out.</p>

        <p>You just asked for evidence of a negative statement, the fact I have to explain to you how that’s stupid is a bad sign. The burden of proof would be for you to find a law that says businesses have to endanger their clientele to accommodate idiots.</p>
