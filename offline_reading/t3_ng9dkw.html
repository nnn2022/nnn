    <strong>"Kill 'em with kindness"</strong>
    <p><p>That has kinda been my motto this last year.   </p>
<p>I've always been good at getting people to do what i want and to wrap them around my little finger so to say. Flatter them and smooth talk them until i get my way. I find this has worked particularly well with the whole mask situation.  </p>
<p>Like is said earlier in a comment i spent part of today shopping. Mask mandates are still very much a thing in any indoor situation here in the Netherlands.  The shopping center/mall itself has plaques everywhere demanding masks. each store demands masks. Even the litt;e stores on the outside of the mall have signs requiring masks. </p>
<p>Hint: i do not wear masks.</p>
<p>I just walk in bold and brazen and smile my prettiest smile. Went to a tiny local ice cream parlor that demands masks. The owners young daughter was walking around and i complimented her on her light-up shoes and pretty dress, then I smiled at the owner who wasn't wearing a mask either and she never asked about a mask.  </p>
<p>Went to a local jeweler/goldsmith to have an old watch repaired and polished. I've visited the same jeweler since i got my first pair of earrings and these people know me. Just walked in maskless and made some nice chitchat about olden times and they never bothered mentioning masks. </p>
<p>While waiting for my watch to be repaired i took a stroll around the mall. Everyone else of the shoppers was masked but no one came up to me to ask about it. Went to a big-brand grocery store  (Albert Heijn for those interested) where they even had a young employee at the entryway in a High-Vis vest who is clearly meant to ask people to mask up and take a cart. One bright smile at him and I was in. No fuss, no muss. None of the stocking-boys or checkout ladies asked anything. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The whole trick for me is just to stay as polite as you can, Dazzle them with your brightest smile and kindest eyes and divert them away from the subject. Some flattery as a distraction also works. They ask about masks? Compliment them on their hair or clothes or whatever is applicable. They're not that smart, chances are they get distracted. Kill them with kindness. Never lose your temper. And don't be afraid to take your business elsewhere. </p>
<p>The local beauty parlor i go to once a year still demands masks. I walked in and asked whether i would have to wear a mask if i made an appointment to get my nails done. They said yes. I said thanks then I won't be making an appointment and walked out. No point fighting them I'm just gonna fuss with my own nails then. They'll either come to their senses or go out of business and maybe a more sensible salon will take their place.</p></p>

        <p>You sound very similar to me op :)</p>
<p>To be clear, I donâ€™t manipulate people because I want to control them, I do it because I donâ€™t want to be controlled</p>

        <p>I was heading into a shop last week and they asked if I was exempt. I said yes. She said 'we're asking the exempt people to come back at 3pm' So I said 'I probably won't be back then' and walked off. Too bad for them because last time I was in there in November I spent Â£30. Shop owners are businessmen. Sooner or later they'll come round.</p>
