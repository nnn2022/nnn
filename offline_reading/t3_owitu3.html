    <strong>I just got banned from my states subreddit for saying covid isa nonissue for kids under the age of 19.</strong>
    <p><p>These people are spreading misinformation.   And I’d argue they are straight up lying. They told me I was “downplaying” facts surrounding kids and covid. There is no other way to talk about it other than to downplay it. Bizarre.</p></p>

        <p>Actually, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7003e1.htm">the mortality rate for COVID-19 pediatric hospitalizations (&lt;18) was <strong>1.50%</strong></a> in 2020 (beginning in March). Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html">the mortality rate for influenza-associated pediatric hospitalizations (&lt;18) was <strong>1.04%</strong></a> in 2018-2019. Therefore, the flu is not more deadly for children -- on the contrary, COVID-19 is about <strong>43.56%</strong> more deadly amongst children aged 18 and younger. Do you like these facts?</p>
<p>Not to mention, the medical community has heavily promoted vaccinations for seasonal influenza. This is because <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/faq.htm">approximately <strong>80%</strong> of flu-associated deaths in children have occurred in children who were <strong>not vaccinated</strong></a>.</p>

        <p>Okay, let's calculate the mortality rate based on infections, then. Of the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7003e1.htm">2,871,828 COVID-19 pediatric infections in 2020 (beginning in March), at least 654 died</a>, indicating a mortality rate of <strong>22.77</strong> per 100K infected. Of the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html">11,296,414 influenza pediatric infections in 2018-2019, around 477 died</a> -- indicating a mortality rate of <strong>4.22</strong> per 100K infected. In other words, by infections, COVID-19 is <strong>439% more deadly</strong> amongst children. Why don't you like these facts, Richard?</p>

        <p>Actually, yours are. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/pbo3ydQ.png">The source of your information is quite literally the same as mine</a>, yours has just been visualized by a third party, and it reported its figures incorrectly: from its source, <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Deaths-Focus-on-Ages-0-18-Yea/nr4s-juj3/data">406 children (&lt;18) have died of COVID-19</a>. Furthermore, the description for this graph explicitly states that <a href="https://i.imgur.com/vbG8KGu.png">the "survey time period" in which this data was collected is "January 1, 2020 to July 21, 2021"</a> -- meaning this is an incomplete recording of all <em>reported</em> deaths, rather than estimates (as used in the influenza and COVID-19 death counts before).</p>
<p>Even taking this data as canon, however, <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/d/n8mc-b4w4/visualization">this would still mean 406 confirmed deaths out of 3,557,529 confirmed pediatric infections</a> -- indicating a mortality rate of <strong>11.41</strong> per 100K infected. In other words, from this year's data, COVID-19 is <strong>170%</strong> more deadly amongst children -- even using only the highest <em>estimates</em> (rather than confirmed deaths) from seasonal influenza. Why don't you like these facts, Richard? Are you really so mathematically illiterate that you could not immediately recognize the difference in the magnitude of the number of infections?</p>

        <p>You can’t use infection numbers when deciding which is more dangerous for children.  A few reasons why:
1-CDC estimates only 1/3 of infections are reported/realized.
2-lack of infection could mean kids do not get infected by the virus thus lowering the danger to them.</p>
<p>About 2/3 kids are vaccinated for the flu each year, yet we agree on 477 deaths.  Without vaccines, I think you’d agree the number would be much higher, right?</p>
<p>The covid deaths were virtually all without vaccination.</p>
<p>It’s amazing you still think you’re right lol.</p>

        <p>I was pointing out your inaccuracy when you showed data about hospitalization resulting in death.   Infection resulting in death ‘would’ be a good metric if we had reliable infection data, but we do not.  This is true for the flu and for covid.  Most (45%) of infection reports from covid comes from routine testing not because of illness (kids rarely get symptoms from covid).  Over 1.6 years, ~200 kids/year died from covid.  For the flu the number is double.   Without vaccine for the flu, the number would likely be 2-3X that.   The flu is significantly deadlier for children than covid.</p>
<p>400 died of covid in 1.6 years.  477 in one year from the flu.   Which one kills more kids per year?</p>
<p>How much is China paying you?</p>

        <p>I'm sorry, do you genuinely just not understand how mortality rates work? Or why comparing absolute numbers might be disingenuous when one of them is set against a backdrop of lockdown ordinances, social distancing protocols, and mask-wearing mandates? This isn't rocket science, but you almost make it seem to be.</p>

        <p>I don't understand it either. I have 2 kids under 12 and I try as a father to let them have as normal of a life as possible. My wife is ever so slightly letting them go to playgrounds. But only if it's not busy and they have to wear their masks if around other kids. This is despite repeated arguments from me that they will be ok, and they need to live normally. The response I always get is, "But we don't know the long term effects, and kids spread germs everywhere! And there's always a chance that our kids will defy the odds and die!!!"</p>
<p>I can't reason with my wife or my other friends who have kids. It is absolutely infuriating</p>
