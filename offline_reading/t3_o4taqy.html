    <p><p>I remember when apparently the Source engine (used in games like CSGO and TF2) apparently got leaked and hackers could download malware if you were playing CSGO and TF2, and everyone fearmongered using obviously fake "hacked" images. At first the fearmongering got me thinking it was real, but the photoshopped images were the equivalent of COVID's BLM protests, they exposed it for me, but the others kept believing it. I questioned "How is everyone still believing this? This is obviously a scam!" The exact same goes for the actual BLM protests, which gave away the pandemic, but strangely everyone else was still scared. Unlike COVID, I don't know what the purpose of the fake Steam leak was, but it shows how easily people get scared over fearmongering even if there is obvious evidence that it's all a hoax.</p></p>
