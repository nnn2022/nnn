        <p><a href="Https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/david-collet-stephan-ezekiel-trial-decision-1.5288343">This reminds me of the persistent tale of Stephan and the Collet family</a></p>
<p>TL;DR a guy had a son who was sick with a fever, which later turned out to be bacterial meningitis.  The father thought it was just a regular fever, and gave natural medicines, but the kid got more sick.  He took the kid to the hospital, apparently "on a mattress in the back seat because the kid couldn't sit straight", where the kid died.</p>
<p>He was found not guilty, but Canadians hate this man.  Ask a blue piller about this man and they'll lose their shit because this man "killed his son".</p>
<p>That happened years ago and they still talk about it.  It perfectly proves your point.</p>

        <p>That sucks and all, but do they think we’re supposed to rush to the ER each and every time we come down with a fever for something? There’s tons of stories of people dying/nearly dying because their cold suddenly turned into meningitis. It happens.</p>

        <p>A guy I used to work with got viral meningitis at 40.  Started out as headaches that he complained about and otherwise ignored for days.  </p>
<p>After a few days he was in quite a bit of pain so he went to the hospital where he was diagnosed.  He was told that had  it been bacterial he probably would have died because of how long he waited to get treatment.</p>

        <p>The issue with bacterial meningitis is by the time you get symptoms, you're a dead man walking most of the time.</p>
<p>It is extremely aggressive and extremely fast moving.</p>
<p>And going by NHS standards they'll have you in the waiting room for 12 hours to die.</p>
<p>In fact, pretty sure that has literally happened...</p>

        <p>Yep it's unfortunate. I also went through bouts and bouts of antibiotics, tests that showed nothing, etc. Turns out that the solution to my repeated tonsilitis episodes with high fever was .... a diet. The 10th doctor I went to connected the dots and figured I had undiagnosed gastric reflux. She sent me to another doctor who just told me to keep a chill a diet (never drink coffee or eat sweets on an empty stomach) and it went away. There still are medics out there who look out for simple causes and lifestyle changes instead of pumping you with meds or sending you to surgery</p>

        <p>Exactly.</p>
<p>I think something like 3,000 kids die of bacterial meningitis every year.  Did they die <em>because</em> they went to the hospital?</p>
<p>Of course not.  That would be as asinine as suggesting this Collet died because he <em>didn't</em> go to the hospital.  </p>
<p>In fact, he did go to the hospital!  Lol.  But, apparently it was "too late".  </p>
<p>Anyway, it's silly.  It's a pure smear job the goal of which to attack natural medicine and to delegitimize Homeopathic doctors.  Big Pharma controlled Media playing the game of showing one kid who died of bacterial meningitis over and over again over years; but they never mention the thousands of kids killed by vaccines every year.  You won't see a detailed story like this for someone who was killed by a vaccine.</p>

        <p>The reason why so many in Canada hate the guy and his wife is because they ignored obvious signs of distress for weeks.  And despite that if it had been anyone else, CAS(childrens aid) would have been knocking down the door with police after the first two weeks if not sooner.</p>
<p>You can read the full transcripts from the case over on CanlII.org just drop in the parents name.  There is far more to it then just what's been published in the article.  The cold fact is both parents failed the kid, and so did the health system here.</p>

        <p>I've given you the basic story.  The vitriol seems to be he used natural medications instead of bringing his son to the doctor.  </p>
<p>What were those "natural medications"?  I'm not sure.  </p>
<p>Apparently he called a Homeopathic doctor, and spoke to the secretary of the office.  The secretary asked the homeopath, who recommended he go to a hospital.  But apparently he didn't follow her advice.</p>
<p>The vitriol that followed was the expected propaganda about "Homeopaths are not real doctors" and "if he had taken the kid to the hospital right away he'd still be alive".</p>
<p>This is of course impossible to prove/disprove.  We know something like 3,000 children die every year from bacterial meningitis.  Would we say the healthcare system killed those children as well?  Of course not.</p>
<p>So basically, the Media (which is directed by Big Pharma), had a narrative to push, especially trying to delegitimize Homeopathic doctors.</p>
<p>The homeopathic doctor here in question was later cleared of all accusations.  But that didn't stop the negative press or comments about her, or the father.  </p>
<p>As you can see from this article, the father was also cleared.  But people were very angry about that.  </p>
<p>So imagine for a moment if you will, you are one of those people angry at this father for not bringing his son to the hospital right away.  You believe it is "child abuse" or something for not immediately bringing your son to the hospital any time he has a fever.</p>
<p>... Oh, but also if you are one of these people, you don't care if thousands of children are injured every year from vaccines.  Because something something, it's still good they got the vaccine.</p>
<p>These are the types of people we are dealing with in Canada, and around the globe.  They understand nothing about health.  They want blind obedience.  They believe anything the news tells them, no matter how absurd.</p>
<p>Does this help to understand the context of the story?</p>

        <p>How many people has the medical system killed? 3rd leading cause of death up until covid was medical mistakes. Makes me wonder if medical mistakes were STILL the 3rd cause of death even AFTER Covid. Since medical mistakes don't get better when there's less supervision and oversight. I'm fairly certain that most of the Covid deaths were preventable.</p>

        <p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>You can show this to people, and they won't even bat an eyelash.  But this one man, this one time he didn't immediately bring his child to the hospital.  And suddenly he and the entire natural health industry is the devil.</p>
<p>It is incredible the power of the press, and how easily people have fallen for it.</p>

        <p>It has a purpose and isn't supposed to replace a hospital. If a chiropractic adjustment is what you need then no medicine or surgery is going to solve the problem, but if you need a surgeon don't go to the chiropractor. </p>
<p>Find a chiropractor you trust who knows his role and is willing to defer treatment to other professionals when appropriate.</p>

        <p>Yes. Chiro focuses on the body's self healing ability.</p>
<p>Your body encounters tons of daily stressors either from you falling, getting into a car accident, lifting something incorrectly, or even dealing with trauma on different parts of the body. Even text neck, or sitting at the computer are stressors. </p>
<p>Because of this, it may form subluxations in the body which are misalignments in different parts of the body which impinges  neural connection to that area of the body similar to dimming the lights which in turn slows down that ability to heal. Over time your body thinks that's normal and many times a lot of issues related to that region may start to appear.</p>
<p>Chiro which realigns the body basically fixes that whole connection and helps the body heal itself.</p>
<p>There's tons more info but I did it in a rush.</p>
<p>Hope it helps!</p>

        <p>This sub has gotta stop posting chiropractors. Its a horrible look. It's not evidence based science. End of story. From what I can tell most the subscribers here are not "anti science" they are anti whatever bullshit the media has been spewing and calling it science. The scientific method brought us out of the dark ages. Chiropractors have 0 medical or science training. Using the scientific method (the one that every single advancement we have to today is based on) for 11 min would disprove chiro.  </p>
<p>I mean, if grown men wanna don lab coats and call themselves "dr" and play "house" thats cool i guess...sad but cool.</p>

        <p>You didn't answer the question about how you'd tell the difference between science and marketing that's trying to pass itself off as science.</p>
<p>Your changing my word of 'most' to your statement of "100% the reason" is a strawman logical fallacy.</p>
<p>Transistors and jet propulsion are not pertinent to the topic at hand.</p>
<p>Antibiotics are a great example of marketing and pseudoscience.</p>
<p>Science says that first and foremost, we need to give our bodies the raw materials they require to function properly.  That science knowledge is ignored in the use of antibiotics.  Science must build on science, never ignore it.</p>
<p>For cases where a bacterial infection would still be a problem, science shows that bacteriophage are the superior solution.</p>
<p>Antibiotics cause bacteria to mutate to no longer be as threatened by the antibiotics.  That <em>causes</em> problems and has lead to a sort of arms race between marketing and mother nature.  Marketing is losing.</p>
<p>As for bacteriophage; while bacteria can mutate to no longer be a target for a specific bacteriophage, another bacteriophage naturally arises that does target the new bacteria strain.</p>
<p>As a medical tool, bacteriophage necessarily <em>must</em> be products of nature.  Products of nature cannot be patented.  Only patented products can generate the greatest profit.  Therefore the healthcare sector has the smallest amount of involvement with products of nature that it can, focusing on patentable synthetic molecules in order to maximize stakeholder value.</p>
<p>You only think antibiotics are the greatest thing because you've been marketed to think that antibiotics are the greatest thing.</p>

        <p>I don’t know why people can’t just recognize the truth, it is obvious. There are quack doctors and chiropractors and there are also fantastic doctors and chiropractors. If they don’t work, why do so many professional/amateur sports franchises/programs either keep them on staff or have recommended chiropractors? It’s simple, because when done right, it has benefits.</p>
<p>I had a shoulder injury, ended my career. I couldn’t move my arm above my shoulder and was in a lot of pain at times. Went to multiple doctors and surgeons who literally offered no relief. Picked my uncle up from a chiropractor appointment one day and walked into the office because I was early. The guy literally put his hands on my shoulder and popped it in some magical way and the pain instantly went away. I have no idea what wizardry he did to me but, I can tell you first-hand that it works at least some times.</p>

        <p>Maybe I'll try later on to see if I can find the sources I've seen that's clearly explicitly listed "medical malpractice" as the third highest cause of death (prior to 2020), and I've also seen terms used along the lines of "avoidable medical care accidents" (not certain if that's the exact quote).</p>
