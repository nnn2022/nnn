        <p>0.26 was the median of all age groups, 0.6 is the upper bound of the elderly age group.  0.26 is more accurate but still too high.  Real ifr is likely to be 0.05 according to Stanford.</p>

        <p>Depends on your age. But keep in mind that if they lower the PCR test cycle threshold there will be fewer infections, increasing the IFR. Although, treatment has gotten much better and the first wave has already hit the most vulnerable...</p>

        <p>No, it won't increase the IFR because the majority of test positive deaths are not caused by covid. If you went back and said 90% of these people who tested positive didn't have it and died of their, on average, 2.6 comorbidities they already had, then suddenly you've got a lot less deaths and the IFR remains relatively unaffected.</p>

        <p>People are exaggerating this 90% died with covid stat. An obese person or someone with diabetes is not likely going to die this year. Covid is what killed them this year.</p>

        <p>The average age of death is 80+ with 2.6 underlying conditions, being obese alone probably won't kill you this year, but being 80, morbidly obese with heart disease certainly could. What's being exaggerated is the condition that the average 'covid death' is in prior to death. Many of them are already in hospice care for terminal conditions. If you don't believe me, you can check out the Cook County Illinois medical examiner data, where you can actually scroll through individual deaths and look at the secondary conditions listed along with age. The vast majority are very old and very sick, not a 55 year old obese person with nothing else wrong.  If the PCR test is truly as inaccurate as stated, most of these deaths didn't have covid at all, so it's not just reducing the total infections, but significantly reducing the number of deaths as well as they have effectively been misdiagnosed as covid positive.  The number of deaths from covid alone is vanishingly small.  Any increase in excess mortality can be explained as lockdown related, which we can now see is responsible for a significant amount of deaths itself.</p>

        <p>But there are lots of deaths for people aged 60-80, these are newly retired people with comorbidities that would have lived. These are some of our excess deaths. However, the majority are older that's for sure.</p>
