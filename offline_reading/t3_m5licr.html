        <p>Entertaining viewpoints, even those you know to be wrong only serves to strengthen your own position. While at the same time you open yourself to new ideas you may have been blocking out for tribal of fallacious reasons. </p>
<p>Keep your money. Reddit doesn't need it and I don't need a sticker to remember this sad interaction. I agree with maybe 10% of the stuff I see written here. But I'd never post something as peak-reddit as "give me one reason to leave my echo chamber and I'll be everyone a pack of wholesome chungus stickers".</p>

        <p>Well, for example, I actually still wear a mask to places where it's required. But I believe that if you're going into a public place, you're taking a risk. I actually got the coronavirus while wearing a half faced respirator with two double N95 filters. I had quarantined for 6 months, only used curbside, and once I ran out of money and returned to work for just 3 weeks I only used that face respirator, glasses, and I changed my clothes as soon as I got home. I never walked into a store, I'd only use curbside, I'd never get take out. I never wanted to risk ingesting another persons germs. Yet, somehow within just 3 weeks of returning to work with all these measures I got covid. I was even the only person I knew at the time to get it, and my other friends and family were going into stores, gyms, eating out, etc. Somehow the person who took it the most seriously got it the worst. I was sick for two weeks. Anyway, the masks, they don't do anything. Sure they could help by idk 1%, but after I got sick wearing a damn air tight respirator and safety glasses, a wimpy clothe mask isn't going to help anyone. Everyone is lying to themselves if they think it's helping. So if you want to avoid getting sick, do what I did, and don't go out, don't eat out, use curb side. Let the people who want to risk it go out. There are so many services available now for people to stay home, so it's about time it gets taken advantage of. We have now had over a year to figure out how to be safe, so we should lift restrictions.</p>

        <p>Then stay home. No one is forcing you to go out. No one is forcing you to get close to others not wearing a mask. You can order groceries online &amp; do curbside pickup, so you won’t have to worry about not getting essentials. </p>
<p>Stop bitching about other people wanting to provide for their families &amp; live their lives. Go get your dose of self virtue from cancelling an old cartoon or something &amp; stop being a honorary member of the covid restriction police.</p>

        <p>If you possess the mindset of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Being against governments implementing terribly harmful mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If someone is terrified and paranoid about this virus, then they should stay home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oepn up again. Protect the vulnerable and take any and all personal precautions necessary in order to feel safe. You live your life, I live mine.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I think you should join the sub. If not (which I'm highly assuming is the case, since you refer to the sub as "cringe"), then you probably shouldn't join the sub. It's like being not at all interested in sports, then going to a sports sub and asking them why you should join.</p>
<p>Also, it's pretty difficult to "debunk" a recommendation and/or opinion lol.</p>
