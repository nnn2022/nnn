    <strong>Question for those who don't want to get vaccinated</strong>
    <p><p>I'm not here to change anybody's mind, just more curious and would like to have a civil discussion with someone who doesn't want to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Disclosure: I'm vaccinated and I believe covid is something to be concerned about for the general population. I also usually get the flu vaccine every year.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li>I see a lot of people say they aren't concerned about covid as a virus. I'm confused by this as when is the last time we have seen hospitals and medical centers overrun with people from a virus on a global scale?</li>
</ol>
<p>I had a bit of trouble of find just total deaths by year going back a ways all in once spot.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.prb.org/usdata/indicator/deaths/chart/">https://www.prb.org/usdata/indicator/deaths/chart/</a> 2019 had 2,854,838 deaths total.</p>
<p>Then according to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/COVID19/index.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/COVID19/index.htm</a> 2020 deaths from all causes was 3,390,019.</p>
<p>So even if you think the number of deaths from covid was inflated. The overall number of deaths in 2020 sky rocketed by 535,181. In previous years it would grow anywhere from 20,000 to 80,000.</p>
<p>So unless something else is killing everyone, how is covid not causing a massive amount of deaths?</p>
<p>2) I have seen discussion about not knowing the long term impact of the vaccines. I agree that this is an unknown. However, since you kind of have to pick covid or the vaccine, why does covid seem like the better choice? We don't know the long term impacts of having covid either. Also, it seems to me the short term impact of covid seems to have been proven in general to be far worse than the short term side affects of the vaccine?</p>
<p>Like I said, not looking to change anyone's mind. I just really have a hard time wrapping my head around why someone chooses covid when given the choice between covid or the vaccine.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>edit** Thanks everyone for the great responses! I have had some good things to think about in the future when put in this position (hopefully never). I'll keep reading through anything new as I get the chance.</p></p>

        <p>I had covid at 24 years old, average weight, sedentary. It was a minor headcold, and now I have antibodies that last at least a year. </p>
<p>My question to you: Since the UK and Israel is booming with more cases of covid, both of which instances find that &rt;50% of the infected are fully vaccinated, why fucking bother? Fully vaccinated, I can still get it, and I can still spread it, so why should I get it?</p>

        <p>I guess I haven't seen those stats. I have seen in the US (which is where I am located) the vaccines we had here are supposedly quite effective and like 97% of people in the hospitals and/or dying are not vaccinated. So I guess the efficacy of the vaccine seems quite good.</p>
<p>You are correct that you were probably low risk for covid and most people get through it without having to go to the hospital. Given the option though between the two, why did you choose covid?</p>

        <p>The vaccines didn't exist when I got it, but I had no intentions of getting a new vaccine for many years regardless of having had covid or not. I'm not anti-vax, I've had the standard MMR, chickenpox, measles, blah blah blah, but I'm not one who is quick to adopt new medical technology without at least several years of trustworthy/unmanipulated statistics. </p>
<p>What I'm seeing is data manipulation all over, whether that is the death for any reason within 28 days of having covid counting as a covid death, or Pfizer's 97% efficacy being a completely made up number by the company that leads in illegal marketing lawsuits, it just makes me even more warry.</p>

        <p>Cool, ya that makes sense. I agree that the data visibility and reporting has been annoyingly tough to find or trust at times. I'm no fan of the media either before any of this and so its been tough to really know what to trust / not trust.</p>
<p>My thought process was that it was unlikely that the whole world could be convinced to have some sort of conspiracy go on at once and if this was nothing to worry about then governments would have been chomping at the bit to be one of the only countries in the world to not have to lockdown and have no increase in deaths.</p>
<p>Thanks a ton for the good discussion, this was what I was hoping to get out of this post!</p>

        <p>Oh, glad your grandfather is doing well again! I wonder if he might have had a tougher time even with covid? I'm glad he is well though, I definitely don't feel like the vaccines are completely safe. I just felt like they were a lot safer than having covid and I wasn't willing to kind of play the odds every time I went out in public of catching covid.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for the discussion, it was helpful</p>

        <p>A very active old man for his age, goes on walks all the time. Way too suspicious not to be related. Not saying covid wouldn't have done the same, but this was directly a vaccine cause/effect heart attack. About a month or two later all the heart swelling shit starting coming out and I became quite livid when my parents shrugged it off as "a coincidence." You can't make some people see the evidence in front of their eyes.. owell.</p>

        <p>1) You really believe that the reason medical centers are having capacity issues is because staff are quitting or are you just messing with me?</p>
<p>2) So you don't believe the numbers of total deaths reported? Why would they make it up? And how would they get all other countries to participate?</p>
<p>3) Ok, now I feel like maybe you are just trolling me. Unless you have some links showing vaccines killing lots of people?</p>
<p>4) How has there been extensive research on the long term impacts of covid when it hasn't been around that long? I see people talking about waiting 4-5 years for long term on vaccine.</p>
<p>5) Right, that's why I'm asking, and I would think you would agree that the majority of information out there all points to this case. I would be curious if you have other sources you can link me to that argue that the vaccine is worse, I would be happy to read them.</p>
<p>I appreciate the response but it seems like you just want to argue with me. Like I said I'm not looking to change anybody's mind, I just want to understand when I have a hard time finding any sources of information that show me otherwise? I might be missing something though.</p>
<p>If you just don't want to take it because you don't believe any information out anywhere from anyone, then just state that.</p>

        <p>&rt;However, since you kind of have to pick covid or the vaccine, why does covid seem like the better choice?</p>
<p>We pick option 3: our immune systems - the same ones that have protected us from C19 for the past 18 months.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;I'm confused by this as when is the last time we have seen hospitals and medical centers overrun with people from a virus on a global scale?</p>
<p>LOL, you mean the TikTok nurses and doctors? Yeah, they were overrun, alright!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;I had a bit of trouble of find just total deaths by year going back a ways all in once spot.</p>
<p>Not a red flag at all, right?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;So even if you think the number of deaths from covid was inflated. The overall number of deaths in 2020 sky rocketed by 535,181.  </p>
<p>You mean to tell me that locking down 340M people and subjecting them to 24/7/365 whilst ensuring that they were sedentary and ate junk food AND CANCELLING ALL NON-COVID HOSPITAL VISITS did not kill hundreds of thousands of people from cancer, heart disease, strokes, diabetes, etc?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;I just really have a hard time wrapping my head around why someone chooses covid when given the choice between covid or the vaccine.</p>
<p>Unless you are a diabetic, heart-disease-stricken, cancer-riddled, hypertensive Hutt, you will be just fine.</p>

        <p>1) Well I guess I was thinking as option 3 as getting covid, like just being exposed I guess. If you end up having no symptoms at all, that certainly is a possibility.</p>
<p>2) I saw someone else mention TikTok in regards to this topic. So your thought is the medical centers, not just in US, but around the world haven't had capacity issues? </p>
<p>3) I mean, I did find it and I found a lot of articles about it but wanted to just try and find it in one spot for multiple years. What is your thought on this? That not that many people actually died, if they are faking the numbers why would they hide the fake numbers? And why would all the other countries go along with this plan?</p>
<p>4) Correct, I guess I find it hard to believe that the lockdown itself was a major cause of deaths. I suppose this will get answered pretty quickly over the rest of this year since lockdowns have largely ended (in US at least). Although I would need to account for the fact that a large number of people are vaccinated. This will be something I keep an eye on though. Thanks.</p>
<p>5) Ya, I get you are statistically correct give the numbers but same thing can be said about the vaccine? Why not just get the vaccine and be almost guaranteed to be fine and at the same time helping out those who can't get vaccinated?</p>

<li>It's more than just a 'possibility' when the IFR is 0.15%.</li>
<li>I am not in the US. The hospitals in my European country were NEVER overwhelmed.</li>
<li>The numbers are debased. All countries are working together because they have signed up to The Great Reset, UN Agenda 2030, UN Agenda 2021, etc. </li>
<li>The northern hemisphere's autunm/winter is going to be bad. </li>
<li>There's no 'guarantee' with anything that is still in the experimental, Phase 3 human trials stage. The only guarantee is the immune system that has worked for the past 18 months. Apparently you did not get the memo that being vaxxed DOES NOT prevent transmission and infection, so the idea that you'll be getting vaxxed to save someone else who cannot get one is one found in one's imagination.</li>

<li>Just looking at stats between the two, why wouldn't I choose to get the vaccine when its percentages are a ton better than covid from both a side effect and death rates? And to say my immune system has been protecting me kind of assumes I have been exposed which I might never have been.</li>
<li>Ok, ya, i'm not sure about the status of all the countries around, so yours might have been different. Glad to hear yours kept things in check.</li>
<li>Interesting, ya I have seen the discussions of it being a global scale thing. I haven't been able to really get behind that given there is almost nothing else in this world all the countries can all coordinate together on. Not to mention there are a lot of countries that hate the US and would jump at a chance to back stab us and say, "sure we will go along with that plan" then just not do any lockdowns or vaccines and show the rest of the world how much better they are with not needing these things.</li>
<li>I'm not quite sure what you mean, why will it be bad in norther hemisphere in winter?</li>
<li>Ya, I totally agree the vaccine isn't completely safe and there very well could end up being some long term issues. I have seen the numbers and while the vaccine doesn't guarantee not getting it at all, I do think the efficacy at preventing severe symptoms and/or death seems to be quite high. There is a good chance that I could get covid and be just fine but there is a much higher chance I take the vaccine and am completely fine, at least from all the info I could find made me feel that way. If I can't trust any of the information then I guess I'm SOL and its kind of impossible to make an informed decision either way.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks for your responses my friend! I was hoping to get some differing opinions.</p>

        <p>For myself, I'm not choosing Covid over the vaccine. I'm certain that I have already been exposed to Covid (prior to vaccines being available), am generally healthy, young, and take my vitamins. I had a relatively minor flu in March of 2020 (maybe it was Covid - idk). So, I'm more confident at this point in time in my immune response and antibodies. If there had been a vaccine available back in early 2020, it would probably be a different story. I just feel like the Covid bridge has been crossed, and I don't feel any urgency or need to ALSO cross the vaccine bridge.</p>

        <p>Stop and think for a moment.</p>
<p>I'll give you a couple of starting points.</p>
<ol>
<li>Was Covid the only thing that occurred in 2020? If not, is it reasonable to conclude that the spike in mortality rate was solely due to the virus? What else happened in 2020? </li>
<li>Think about the lockdowns. Were they based on scientific research? What evidence constituted that they would help stop the spread? What harm did they bring about? A vast increase of reluctance in the public to visit hospitals for serious conditions that are otherwise treatable, for fear of contracting the virus. A nearly 40% drop in patients treated for severe heart attacks after March 2020 compared to the year before (data in the US). Could that have contributed to the excess deaths last year?</li>

        <p>Thats an interesting point, I haven't seen that thought yet.</p>
<p>According to CDC, 655,000 Americans die from heart disease each year on average, so I suppose if 40% of people with heart disease don't go to the hospitals for it and now die where they wouldn't then could be a large increase.</p>
<p>Thanks for the good response.</p>
<p>Do you have any thoughts on why the government would choose to do lockdowns for covid if it really wasn't an issue? I like your thought process and this was something else I didn't really understand. If a government had a chance at saying, "psh, we don't need that here" and could go through covid without issues, wouldn't they want to do that? Just to show how great they are and also to help the economy?</p>

        <p>I like to think that it was just a panic response at first. When you don't know what you're up against, you tend to overreact, just to be on the safe side. But a year and a half into this and most of the world still living as if it is March 2020? Things don't add up. The honest answer is that I don't know why governments continue to impose ludicrous restrictions for a virus that poses virtually no threat to the vast majority of the young, able and productive population, especially considering the fact that there are other approaches that offer protection to those vulnerable and susceptible to the virus that also kick the "lockdown-for-all" and the harms it brings about right out of the equation. <a href="https://gbdeclaration.org/focused-protection/">Focused Protection</a> is one approach that has been ignored. Why? Because!</p>
<p>You can find a lot of diverse opinions in this sub on why governments are acting this way, but they are all rooted in the fact that things just don't add up. Something stinks. With each day that passes, I become more and more convinced that this was not just a mere overreaction but rather planned, malicious and sinister intent. To what end, only history will show.</p>

        <p>Ya, it definitely seemed like there was a lot of chaos and unknowns in the beginning. Even there still are. That I have no doubt.</p>
<p>I took a look at that focused protection thing, and ya I would have preferred if there could have been a middle ground and I'm not a fan of the total lock down kind of thing. Although I also feel this isn't just a regular flu type thing and that if left unchecked the deaths would have been much greater without the lockdown.</p>
<p>Do you think it really is possible to have had a something planned and executed on a global scale? Why would countries that hate each other agree to go along with it and not just make the other countries look like idiots? For example why wouldn't China not do any lock downs or vaccines and make US look pathetic? Or same thing with Russia (I think Russia had lock downs?) That has been the biggest thing for me to get over when thinking about this being some planned thing is I just don't see all these other countries going along with it. Much less also Trump going along with Democrats in doing things like shutting down borders or ordering vaccines. I would think he would have stuck to his guns and said, we don't need any of this, just watch. </p>
<p>I could be wrong though.</p>

        <p>Over 50, had covid, fairly mild symptoms.</p>
<p>Don't see why I need the vaccine, as I have certainly built up a natural immunity.</p>
<p>Also, I have a pre-existing condition that could be made deadly if I get vaccinated - yes, admittedly the odds are extremely against this reaction, but why chance it?</p>

        <p>It's all because of the censorship and defaming. I actually listened to those censored and defamed. What they said was much closer to my own perception of what was going on. After doing so I was under the impression that I've been lied to by government and media since a long, long time.</p>
<p>What happened to exponential growth? What happened to flatten the curve? You don't hear that anymore because none of these scenarios played out as predicted.</p>
<p>Ever since some expert always was concerned about some new development. Yet I still don't even know anyone who actually had severe covid in person.</p>

        <p>Don't get me wrong, I'm not fan of the government or the media. Which has made this difficult to sift through good information and bad information.</p>
<p>I don't just trust someone though just because they aren't being covered by media though either.</p>
<p>As for exponential growth, why wouldn't the reduction in cases and deaths be contributed to the vaccine? Numbers were spiking up at the end of last year, beginning of this year and started falling as people have been getting the vaccine. Not to mention, why not believe that wearing masks and social distancing helped reduce the spread until vaccines could get going?</p>
<p>Although I will say the numbers don't quite make a ton of sense when it comes to like India who hasn't vaccinated many people but according to the CDC numbers new cases/deaths have been falling quite a bit there. So things like that, it seems fishy too. So I understand where you are coming from with not trusting the government.</p>

        <p>I see, well that was when all the lockdowns were going in place, right? Do you feel like that helped at all? That was what it seemed like to me. People stayed in home/used masks numbers went down. Then people got tired and started going out again and doing stuff and then numbers started spiking end of last year then we get the vaccines and numbers coming down but have remained steady now since a large portion of US still doesn’t want to get the vaccine. It seemed like the numbers fit pretty well with how the story unfolded. I would maybe also argue that going from 100 deaths a day to 2000 in April/may is an exponential growth.</p>
<p>Let’s say it never gets worse than it did end of last year. Even still, don’t the numbers look pretty bad? Isn’t this something we should all try and prevent getting and spreading? If we do nothing wouldn’t numbers get like December/January again?</p>

        <p>I would say it behaved pretty much like expected according to this diagram:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a3/bf/19/a3bf196b574bc379736337de42076c49.jpg">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a3/bf/19/a3bf196b574bc379736337de42076c49.jpg</a></p>
<p>Basically: It seems that seasonality is what has by far the most impact. People's behavior seems of much less importance.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Wodarg Coronaviruses have always had their share of being linked respiratory diseases. It's just that noone really looked for it before. There was no difference in treatment depending on whether it was Adenovirus, Influenza or Coronavirus so which one of these was involved wasn't relevant.</p>
<p>The only number that really seems to make sense to me is the average age of death. The exponential growth was there as long as there also was an exponential growth for tests and we were still on Coronavirus-season. After that, even with a steadily high amount of tests the numbers plummeted... Until the next coronavirus-season.</p>
<p>The numbers only look bad when you don't put them into relation.<br>
I'm not even convinced that this actually spreads at all and is not just developed individually. I theorize that cells under stress from cold or whatever will start excreting coronavirus on their own without the need of "being infected". Basically: How do we know that a never looked for before virus is actually a cause of disease and not just a symptom? Maybe because we are so caught up in our dogmatic believes of how diseases work, that we just took something as a given that someone claimed and plausibly explained a hundred years ago.<br>
I predict that we will have higher numbers again between December and April and lower numbers between May and November.</p>

        <p>There certainly probably is a seasonality aspect to this. I do agree with that.</p>
<p>If this was something that just wasn’t looked for before then why such a jump in overall deaths in 2020 and now 2021? Just looking at the overall deaths in the year, I can see a much higher than average increase once this all started picking up. That’s what is a large stopping block for me when it comes to the thought of “this is nothing to worry about or the numbers are inflated or whatever” .</p>
<p>Something is killing a lot more people, and even if the average age of death is 50+, I’ll be 50 one day and I don’t really want my life expectancy to drop down to 60 or 70 because now there is this virus floating around.</p>
<p>Like, unless something is done this won’t go away ever. So it’s a matter of time until I’m 50+ and I get some new variant. Not to mention not wanting to get my parents sick.</p>
<p>I won’t argue that the world was going to shit just in a general sense before covid even so not like things were dandy and this came out of nowhere.</p>

The absolutely insane policies of governments worldwide regarding vaccines is hardening my opinion too.<br>
Regarding your death stats, I agree the USA appears to suffered excess deaths in 2020, important to note other total lockdown counties have fared out worse.<br>
Also comparing one year with another is problematic. A run down of USA deaths over the last 20 years, coupled with population growth, average age of population etc need to be taken into account for accurate picture.</p>

        <p>Right, populations do matter, but the one link showed the total deaths since like 2014 to 2019 and it looked on average total deaths would increase by around like 40-50k per year. Except in 2020 when it increased by 500k. So it definitely looks to be far beyond any normal growth etc.</p>
<p>Even if you believe you have low risk from covid though, given the number of people who aren't low risk, wouldn't it seem like a good idea to get the vaccine to lower your risk even farther while at the same time helping to protect those who are higher risk?</p>

        <p>I get that people vaccinated can still catch and spread covid but from what I have read, those rates are much lower than if you weren't vaccinated. I think most vaccines aren't 100% guarantee. Like the polio vaccine isn't a guarantee you won't get polio but since everyone (or most everyone) gets the polio vaccine, you don't hear of anyone getting polio. Same thing with measles, you hear of random outbreaks of measles in areas where people stop getting the vaccine because now it exposes everyone.</p>
<p>Same thing here, if everyone gets the covid vaccine and the covid vaccine is only 90% effective, overall it creates a better situation for everyone. Not to mention there are people who aren't able to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>So, yes technically there is still a chance you could catch covid and pass it on to others but if you and those others are both vaccinated the chances of covid continuing to spread farther is much lower.</p>

        <p>I get that you can choose to take the vaccine or not. My question is why choose not to? Is it that you don't believe any information regarding it?</p>
<p>That's fine if you don't, at that point it would be pretty much impossible for anyone to convince you otherwise at that point. I also didn't make this post to try and convince anyone to change their mind also. Just satisfy my own curiosity.</p>

<p>Do you just think you won’t get covid? And thus don’t need a vaccine for something you won’t get?</p>

        <p>If the choice is COVID or the shot, the choice was made for me in March 2021: I caught it, had mild symptoms for a few days, and then was fine. No long term effects AFAICT. I see no point in adding a bunch MORE unknowns to guard against a disease that I probably can't catch again and seem to have no difficulty fighting off anyway.</p>
<p>We do not see large numbers of recovered people catching it again (if we did, the media would be <em>all over</em> that blasting it everywhere 24/7). People who recovered from SARS-1, similar but not the same, ~17 years ago still have at least some immunity. Natural immunity is real. We don't know for sure how long it lasts but we know it's over a year and <em>may</em> be decades or even lifelong.</p>

        <p>Yes, but your information is biased and generalized among a population of different ages. Over 50, 600,000 have died. Under 50, 18,000. Animal studies were 56 days then the animals were killed so long term side effects could not be observed. Multiple studies are coming out, then suppressed by governments around the world on the dangers of the spike protein alone. Mandatory vaccines everywhere despite no data on long term side effects.</p>

        <p>I would be interested in seeing some of these studies on the spike protein but I have had issues finding them, could you link one or two for me?</p>
<p>I know we don't know the long term effects of the vaccine, but we also don't know the long term effects of covid.</p>
<p>I did a quick search to see if I could find number of deaths by age groups. I found <a href="https://usafacts.org/articles/preliminary-us-death-statistics-more-deaths-in-2020-than-2019-coronavirus-age-flu/">https://usafacts.org/articles/preliminary-us-death-statistics-more-deaths-in-2020-than-2019-coronavirus-age-flu/</a> which indicates that if you are over 25 then death rates are up quite a large amount even if under 50. Which I fall into that range.</p>

        <p>1) look at the demographics of deaths with (not even of) covid. In most Western countries the age of someone dieing with covid is higher than the average age of death anyway. There are also all the comorbidities etc as well.</p>
<p>I have no comorbidities and tend to be the fittest person in the room. I'm 31 and below 15% bodyfat and can still run 400m in under a minute. I exercise regularly 5x a week and eat a very healthy diet. The only physical issues I have are "mechanical" like a recurring lower back injury and clicky knees. </p>
<p>2) it's not just a choice between covid and the vaccine. I don't want either. </p>
<p>I think the gym is probably the busiest place I go, and most people are fit and healthy so the probability of getting covid is low.</p>
<p>There is no rigorous safety data on the vaccines. We know they are effective against covid. What we don't know is what damage they cause. The vaccines might be safe for someone like me- but we don't know that because of the incomplete data. I find it strange that this data isn't being published as if it were I'd happily take the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Hmm, while the average age of death from covid might be higher than average age of death. If we could eliminate a large source of deaths, lets say cancer or heart disease, two things that impact older groups of people more so than younger. Why wouldn't we do that?</p>
<p>You are very close to me in age and fitness levels. You run and exercise more than me.</p>
<p>2) I can understand not wanting either but given the situation that nobody gets vaccinated, or a very low % do. (so you aren't just depending on others to protect you) then it is probably likely that you will at some point get covid. At the very least you would be playing roulette every time you go somewhere.</p>
<p>You are right that we don't know long term impacts on vaccine but from all the data I can find, it seems to me that given what we know from the time we have had both covid and the vaccines running around. It seems like the vaccine is a much safer option.</p>
