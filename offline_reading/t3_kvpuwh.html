    <strong>Covid-19 Hysterics preaching about "collective responsibility" as justification for draconian economy-killing pandemic lockdown measures are idiots.</strong>
    <p><p>" Itâ€™s not just self-responsibility, you have to be responsible for the community too."</p>
<p>So is the community going to be responsible for the businesses that go under, people who lose their jobs and livelihoods that kept them surviving month to month with barely any financial reserves? Who's responsible for them? You think people don't die from poverty or running out of money? And you think the effects aren't just as long-lasting as the so-called "long COVID" effects? </p>
<p>Not just people losing jobs, but also future working generations seeing their futures permanently crippled and hampered because God forbid they had a say in graduating in the middle of a pandemic killing the economy, borders shut so they can't even get on their bikes to work overseas, and forced to scrap for meagre-paying gig jobs that are unstable and will forever weigh down their earning potentials, because let's face it working society now will still give pay raises pegged hard to your previous salary, so starting low means you'll never get as high as you would ordinarily have.  </p>
<p>Those who preach about collective empathy and solidarity with greater humanity as a whole are often the most callous towards individual suffering. As some in Africa said succinctly, the bigger fear is dying from economic deprivation than some potential virus. Unpopular truth, but it has to be said. Climate change and global warming might have been the Boomer generation fucking over the planet's health and leaving Gen Z and after to pick up the pieces, but COVID-19-justified lockdown measures that outright kill off the middle class businesses and economic health is laid on the doorsteps on every single Doomer or mindless government shill who can't seem to get a grip on proportionality and sanity, regardless of generation class. And it will be our future generations paying an even heavier price for it.</p></p>

        <p>I goes beyond the economy.  They have crushed the arts, community life, family life, joyous experiences, life milestones, travel, the very human soul.  Becoming an empty husk of my former self and wishing for death over this current life is for the greater good?  It's selfish to want to be human again?  Fuck.  That.</p>

        <p>I've been saying this the whole time.  Telling people they are responsible for the health of others while ignoring the hardships doing so creates is the most selfish thing ever. The hypocracy on this one is thick.
I'm responsible for my health. Me. I am. Nobody else. If I'm deathly afraid of a virus, I'll stay home and do what I need to do to protect <em>myself</em>. I don't think it's terribly far fetched to expect others to do the same.</p>

        <p>And if I judge going out and living my life as I did before the goddamn China-born-and-bred pandemic swept the world as a calculated risk I'm willing to take in order to live my life the way I want it, it's on me too. I'm fine with it. If I get COVID, it's on me, I'm not gonna blame anyone else, and I'm quite sure I'll come out fine on the other side regardless. I paid up my health insurance, that's where it kicks in to protect and safeguard me financially if I end up ill enough to need hospitalisation. </p>
<p>All I want is to be given the choice to choose what I wish to do, according to my own risk tolerance. Life is all about that. But no... people like myself have to put up with idiots saying we're selfish or we're granny killers.</p>

        <p>Those virtue signalers never gave a fuck if I kill myself, so why should I give a fuck if they get covid? I mean, I can't demand that they come over and hang out with me so I don't commit suicide from social isolation. Which would be them putting themselves st risk for me. So why should I deprive myself of everything that makes life worth living, thus putting myself at risk, to protect them? You're right: "collective responsibility" these days is just a way of saying "my fear of covid is more important than your life".</p>

        <p>I feel so fucking bad for young people right now. They are still losing their lives, just not to COVID. Think of all the senior proms not attended, all the trips not taken, the sleepovers and parties not had, it breaks my heart. For the older kids, their futures are fucked. Anyone graduating college right now is fucked. Theres no jobs for them, and there likely never will be. By the time they get the chance (and I do believe restrictions will loosen, but masks are forever), they will be passed over for younger students with more relevant education experience. These COVID students will be working gigs and minimum wage slave labor for their entire lives.</p>
<p>Dont even get me started on weddings, funerals, etc. These are not only spiritual in nature, but fundamental to the human experience. How horrible that they're separating families from their loved ones "for their own good". I dont want the government protecting me for my own good.</p>

        <p>This is why I've been in the mood to do these things again. Luckily, I've been able to do some of these things since it started (a lot of people I know are against this whole thing). As for my future plans, my grip on them was weakened since this started because I'm wondering what's even going to happen in the future. Seems like the future has went from bright to dark in months. I'm even wondering if I'll even be alive on Earth in the next 15 to 30 years for a few different reasons from this. I'm hoping it would go well, but this is my warning to the people of Earth: You better watch your back for the next few years, because if not, I can only guarantee what's going to happen.</p>

        <p>It's ironically the exact opposite of "collective responsibility" if you think about it. The doomers just shift the responsibility to the more vulnerable who are way more affected by the lockdown, and who have to "expose" themselves to Covid way more by working blue collar jobs. When they say "our" responsibility they mean YOUR responsibility to protect THEIR family and ease THEIR fears. They sacrifice 1% of what they ask others to sacrifice, if they aren't outright benefiting from lockdown. Dr. Sunetra Gupta describes this as a toxic form of individualism.</p>
