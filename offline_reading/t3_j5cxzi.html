        <p>In this case, though, I'd say it's the exact opposite.  It harms most people, even if the victims themselves are unaware and welcome it.</p>

        <p>I completely agree... trying to convince people of that thought seems impossible so I went at their own flawed logic.</p>

        <p>I disagree and agree with this at the same time. The greater good is really more important then the individual, but in this situation, it is not the case. In this case, the greater good is being sacrificed for the minute amount of individuals who are at risk</p>

        <p>When you say the greater good is more important than the individual do you agree that it is ok for the government to take your life or severely maim your livelihood, to save someone else?</p>
<p>The health of the whole is always important but we must consider the relationship between the benefits given to the many and the harm done to a few. </p>
<p>We must also allow for personal freedom. </p>
<p>Think of the lottery. You have a one in a million chance at winning big. You probably won’t win but if you do you’d have it made! </p>
<p>Now imagine you have to play a different kind of lottery where it’s forced upon you and instead of a one in a million chance at winning big money you have a once in a million chance at having to pay a small fine. </p>
<p>Why would anyone play that game? </p>
<p>The benefits of playing and not “winning” would have to be good enough that they are worth that risk of paying a fine.</p>
<p>Now let’s increase the “harm”. Now the lottery is still forced upon you and now instead of a one in a million chance at incurring a small fine you have a once in a million chance at dying. </p>
<p>Why would anyone play that game? </p>
<p>The benefits of playing and not “winning” would have to be good enough that they are worth that risk of dying. </p>
<p>Is this ever worth it? And is it ever ok to force this risk onto another person? </p>
<p>Now our actual situation is even more convoluted because the portrayed “greater good” is actually the few and the “few harmed” are actually the majority. </p>
<p>And so the conversation must switch to evaluating the relationship between the benefits of the masses to the harm done to the few;
and the necessary freedom people should have to choose.</p>
