    <strong>I will never see people the same way who give this experiment to kids</strong>
    <p><p>I know when a friend sees my blog, she has access but only rarely reads, she's probably going to unfriend me. She had her two teens vaccinated, one is over 18 but too influenced to have said no. I can't believe someone would gamble on the lives of two healthy kids who have little to no danger from the virus. I know other people with kids, but don't know if they are giving them this vaxx or not. I never had kids [health] and can't understand people who are doing this to their kids. In fact I feel angry at them. Why would you do that to them? Even the long term effects could destroy their fertility or life spans if there are no early deaths.</p></p>

        <p>I agree. I've even shielded my 16 yo from having to wear a mask. I absolutely forbid it. It's wrong. All of this is wrong. I think social media has been really bad with all the photos and bragging. Easy for young people to get caught up in it. I actually think the ice bucket challenge was a test run for this psychological warfare.</p>

        <p>I refused to do the ice bucket challenge and even posted against it on my old bible prophecy conspiracy blog. I think it was a test run and they have been running mind control experiments on the populace as a whole. Who will line up like a lemming. I am glad you have shielded your 16 year old. Children wearing masks look depressed to me. They will have trauma and PTSD on some level.</p>

        <p>Children have no informed consent, and well that's a problem. I also think the Covid vaxx are far more risky, children don't even have risk from Covid or very little, that alone makes public health in America now betraying and sociopathic.</p>

        <p>I know. I was having a conversation with 3 women yesterday and 2 of them mentioned they were vaccinated. When we discussed the vax and the pandemic, I realized how misinformed they all were. They literally believe everything they see on the news and believe the vaccines are completely safe. I brought up the blood clots and myocarditis and they just said how rare it was. I replied how rare it was for someone to die from Covid and that you had to catch it to begin with. Like, what in the world!</p>

        <p>I have realized that too talking to vaccinated people. One thing I noticed is many believe these Covid Vaxx are like our traditional vaccines that worked and stopped transmission and make them immune. I would say this applied to at least half of the people and one could tell even in how they talked about getting vaxxed. "We are all safe now, now we can't spread it!" Ponder the fact none of us unvaxxed people would have to be concerned to go visit vaxxed people because they would be immune and would be unconcerned about what we do. I think they planned all this for more division. I brought up side effects and had some parroting things like "It's only 1 in a million!" or 1 in 7 million. When I told them I knew people who got sick, including seizures and other bad stuff, they just didn't care and pooh-poohed it all.</p>

        <p>Yes, it seems to be no use explaining but I’ll keep trying every opportunity that I get. The more people that get vaxxed, the more likely we are to lose our freedom going forward. One of those 3 women I was chatting with yesterday said she works in health management. She just got back from working abroad in London. Her company is contracted on working on a vax passport for the VA and DOD. She immediately caught herself and said maybe she shouldn’t have mentioned that. Why is our government hiring a global corporation to make vaccine passports for federal entities after Biden already said federal workers wouldn’t be required to get the shot?</p>

        <p>I've had such bad times trying to talk to the vaxxed, I gave up. I am kind of trying to stay under the radar in everyday life, I live in a town that is very much of the system, I want to move but husband doesn't want to. He does have arguments there are more medical and other resources we need. 90 percent of everyone I know locally got vaxxed---[posted on FB, I didn't ask] That scares me they want vax passports for fed employees. Looks like Biden lied, maybe Kamala will be changing that policy, Biden I think will step down due to health and is growing old.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I don’t take politicians word very seriously. They change their tune all the time. Especially “unprecedented times” such as these. I’m going to keep telling people how I feel, though I have lost friends and it’s definitely uncomfortable. It’s crazy because I’ve never been a serious person. But I feel like things are happening so fast I’ll regret it if I don’t stick up for what I believe in. But totally get why it’s not in my best interest personally.</p>

        <p>You may be better off being able to tell them how you feel. I don't feel as close to people anymore or even the same about many of them. I have lost friends with the few I did open my mouth to. I am sticking up for what I believe as it comes up, but I also don't want to fight with every idiot.

        <p>As a parent of younger kids (still ineligible, thankfully) this keeps me up at night.  </p>
<p>I can’t understand how a pediatrician whose patient is a young, healthy child can recommend this vaccine in this context (emergency use etc) when they have to know it is not in the interest in THEIR patient.  </p>
<p>Even if they believe that it is protecting others in the population (big stretch, but for argument’s sake), they should be treating their own patients, not acting as freelance epidemiologists.  I actually do not understand how this is happening and have lost respect/trust in any doctor who would tell me with a straight face that my children should get this.</p>

        <p>Yeah protect your kids. I think there is something very wrong with sacrificing the young to protect the old, that alone means something evil has taken over our society. I am high risk and on the "older" side 50s but do not want any kids to have their lives ruined. I would think negatively of any doctor who wants the kids put at risk like that.</p>

        <p>Yeah I would look at them like they are growing a second head too. I don't get it. Why do they want to put their children at risk from this it's so evil.

        <p>I agree. It seems like they believe that their one year old is at risk from Covid, and that is why they want to only hang out outside, since they have the vaccine. I tried to talk to them about how she is quite safe, but I was told "We are never going to agree on this."  </p>
<p>To me, it really blows my mind that the same people who are scared of the side effects from Covid don't consider the side effects from the Vaccine. I don't understand.</p>

        <p>I agree. I wonder how things will be for them even breathing wise after wearing the masks so many hours. I can't even stand the 1-2 hours I wear for shopping or medical appointments. When I went to the library I went outside for a time to take the mask off and went back in. Little Johnny and Sally probably are getting punishments for taking the masks off and being forced to wear them for 7-8 hours, maybe 10-12 if they have to go to daycare after school.</p>

        <p>I can't have kids either because of my health too and this whole thing makes me so fucking angry. These people have obviously never lost a baby or had to struggle and fight their own bodies to become parents. Its infuriating to see they can't even stop for a minute a think logically when it comes to their children. </p>
<p>My sister is the same -- can't wait to inject my niece and nephew with this shit. My niece already has cognitive disabilities (that I honestly believe came from her jam packed vaccine schedule as a toddler since she had normal cognition until they loaded her up with a vaxcocktail because my sister wanted it over with. My niece had febrile seizures from the fever/reaction. Since then she got this foggy faraway look in her eyes and has trouble speaking.) and my sister has allowed them to be so brainwashed that they can't leave the house because of anxiety. They don't even want to play in the backyard without a mask! so of course they're begging her to get the vaccine now and they are 9 and 11. Its fucking child abuse but no real surprise there since my step mother/her mother was a goddamned psycho when I was growing up.</p>

        <p>Agreed. I have also lost all respect for people who chose to have kids during lockdown, and with the way the world is going, bringing any more kids into it is surely criminal.</p>
