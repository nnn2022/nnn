    <strong>If the vaccines are 90% &amp; 94% effective against serious symptoms or death; then riddle me this</strong>
    <p><p>I got a COVID test the other day. It was a rapid test.
I read this paper they handed me right after getting my negative results back. </p>
<p>It claimed that ‚Äúthe covid test (that I just paid $155 for) AND PCR testing is not 100% accurate. It didn‚Äôt disclose the accuracy. So I asked the nurse what the accuracy of the test actually is: she didn‚Äôt know. I ask my doctor the next day: he doesn‚Äôt really have a definite number on their accuracy. </p>
<p>Doing some research I found on Harvard‚Äôs website. Almost 20% false negatives when up to 5 days after the first symptoms. But they STILL don‚Äôt have an absolute number number. ‚ÄúCould be more‚Äù basically</p>
<p>On that same piece of paper I got from the clinic: a few paragraphs down it says between 5% and 60% of COVID cases are believe to have few to no symptoms. 
That‚Äôs a 55% difference in spread. Fam, Super Bowl Predictions predictions are more accurate than that üò≠</p>
<p>It basically says that medical professionals cannot tell who has COVID and of those people they cannot be sure how many are asymptotic, or just don‚Äôt have it. </p>
<p>So my question is: </p>
<p>When they tests the vaccines, how do they have enough information to claim that a vaccine is 90% effective &amp; 94% effective for reducing symptoms or avoiding death when there‚Äôs no way to tell who ACTUALLY has COVID and who‚Äôs already asymptotic to it. </p>
<p>The vaccine can‚Äôt have an effectiveness rate determined when the researchers don‚Äôt know the other solid data metrics ü•∏</p>
<p>This may be why the CDC is telling you to stay masked up after getting the vaccines - because they don‚Äôt know how effective they really are </p>
<p>So I‚Äôm gonna sit this vaccine out 
But that‚Äôs just me</p></p>

<p>&rt;It‚Äôs also unclear to what extent people with no symptoms transmit SARS-CoV-2. The only test for live virus is viral culture. PCR and lateral flow tests do not distinguish live virus. No test of infection or infectiousness is currently available for routine use.678 As things stand, a person who tests positive with any kind of test may or may not have an active infection with live virus, and may or may not be infectious.</p>

        <p>When they tested the vaccines, they did not run regular PCR tests on everyone. They looked for symptoms, and symptoms alone. This is the reason why no one has been able to definitively state that the shot prevents spread, because they didn't test everyone for infections. They were able to prove that the vaccinated group experienced far less symptoms than the placebo group.</p>

        <p>I remember being hopeful, though, after reading it. Naive me thought, "Well, then it won't be a big deal if anyone chooses not to get it, since it really doesn't protect anyone but the one who takes the shot." I figured that they'd be happy and content with protecting Grandma and leave the rest of us alone.</p>

        <p>I went to dentist today and assistant sneezed - apologized and assured me it was allergies - and then said she couldn't get in touch with her doctor for allergy medicine so went to urgent care earlier in day where those checking her in told her she had covid.  And she was like I do not have covid, I have seasonal allergies (which are really really bad here right now) and I want medicine but can't get in touch with my regular doctor so here I am.  And they repeated you have covid.  So she said I don't have covid, and I and those around me have been vaccinated for weeks.  And they said matter of fact - that doesn't matter  you still have covid and vaccines don't mean you dont.  so she said give me a test if you must.  And they said we don't want to waste a test on you because you have covid and she was like whatever I'm leaving...  and she went to work...</p>

        <p>I legit know something was off in my body. </p>
<p>I want to update everyone on this. I went back to the doctor today because I feel still like I have the flu. They didn‚Äôt test me for that last time but I figure I‚Äôd get it out of the way. </p>
<p>I tested negative for the flu. </p>
<p>Keep in mind this was at a different urgent care clinic. </p>
<p>The doctor says ‚Äúwell, I know you were just tested for covid 2 days ago. But lets do this again bc time makes a difference‚Äù 
Me- ‚Äú... perfect, this is my opportunity to see the differences in paperwork‚Äù </p>
<p>I get tested. </p>
<p>POSITIVE FOR COVID. NO JOKE </p>
<p>The first paperwork they handed me on the negative result 2 days ago started with a disclaimer in the first sentence saying ‚Äúthis test is not 100% accurate‚Äù </p>
<p>The positive paperwork? ‚ÄúYOU HAVE COVID QUARANTINE 10 DAYS FROM FIRST SYMPTOMS AND WAIT 24 HOURS WITHOUT FEVER‚Äù 
Like there was no disclaimer on it. </p>
<p>I will gladly post these two pieces of paper contradicting each other in another post in this subreddit</p>
<p>Me: ‚Äúsee, the tests aren‚Äôt accurate‚Äù 
Doctor: ‚Äúwell apparently they are because you have covid‚Äù </p>
<p>I JUST TOLD YOU I TESTED NEGATIVE TWO DAYS AGO DOCTOR so somebody is wrong here </p>
<p>Wanting to be right doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre accurate</p>
<p>The agenda push is real. </p>
<p>Do I probably really have COVID? Yep probably I feel every symptom. </p>
<p>Is that the point? No, it‚Äôs the fact that if I didn‚Äôt willingly go back to the doctor again because they missed the diagnosis then I would be working about normal life and spreading but the medical community doesn‚Äôt want that responsibility on their back</p>

        <p>From what I gather, they use the vagueness amd uncertainty of the tests, as well as the asymptomatism to justify everyone masking up. Since we don't know who has COVID or not, let's just assume everyone has it.</p>

        <p>Yeah. The test is not FDA approved. The tests are about 50/50 to go positive if you aren‚Äôt sick with who knows? (CDC counts PIC now, pnuemonia, influenza, coronavirus all lumped together). It‚Äôs fraud. I wouldn‚Äôt even get a test tbh because I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they are collecting other data from that swab they aren‚Äôt telling you. This is about control and crushing you until you submit to their new ‚ÄòGreat Reset‚Äô system.</p>

        <p>I'm in big pharma, so I actually know the answer.  The difference is that the tests they used in the pfizer and Moderna trials were performed by people who were specially trained in how to administer them, and so have a lower false positive rate, and false negative rate.  The tests were also better.  A diagnostic lab near here was using saline instead of viral transport medium to store samples and so had a very high false negative rate; those tests would never be used in a clinical trial, but accounted for 40% of the tests in my county for months.  My mom's test was done by a nurse in her facility, then stored for 72 hours before being sent in - definitely a false negative.  When we open a clinical site for a trial, there's days of training and validation of the staff and their procedures, and the FDA actually looks at those numbers.  Last, in one of the studies, theu took blood to count t cells that kill covid, and didn't look only at antibody levels, and guess what?  Several people with low antibody levels were actually immune due to high t cell counts.  The Pfizer CSO himself pointed out that you actually are protected against severe disease about 12 days after the first shot - but antibody levels don't increase until three weeks after that.  So it is clearly not just antibodies providing protection.</p>

        <p>Good point.</p>
<p>The use of control groups would also help get a more accurate answer despite accuracy variance in COVID detection.</p>

        <p>Honestly, I stopped reading when you wrote that you paid for a test.</p>
