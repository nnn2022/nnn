    <strong>Glad to see I am not alone. Also greetings from finland!</strong>
    <p><p>Hey everyone,  </p>
<p>I started to feel sceptical about this Covid-fearmongering few months ago when finnish newspapers wrote big articles multiple times about a finnish celebrity getting horrible symptoms after tested Cov19 positive.   </p>
<p>Soon after that celebrity tweeted many times that "These articles are made up, I had covid but had no symptoms" and she asked news companies to stop making up those fake news about her.  </p>
<p>After I read her tweets, I started to think that maybe other news are fake and made up and I lost my trust to media pretty much about Covid-news.  </p>
<p>I have been reading a lot of actual studies that universities around the world have made that Covid is not actually that bad, not much worse vs. regular flu and so many studies how face masks don't help against air borne viruses. I don't know why media is not publishing these studies at all. Tried to share this info with my friends but they all think I am crazy.  </p>
<p>Earlier I thought that "conspiracy theorists" are crazy folk but now that I think using my own brain, reading studies etc.. I realized that ppl thinks now I am one of them.</p>
<p>I don't know what's going on with Covid but it surely is not normal.  </p>
<p>Glad to see there are plenty of like minded ppl in here!</p>
<p>Sorry from my bad english :)</p></p>
