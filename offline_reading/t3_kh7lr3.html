        <p>I think like many of us its tricky to think in positive terms. But instead of "no independent thought" how about " think for yourself" or "think independently " instead of "do not question authority" simply "question authority".</p>

        <p>Those are great choices. I agree with you. There is enough doom and gloom going around. When you make people feel like idiots (even if they act like it) they are more likely to respond with negative emotions. </p>
<p>If the goal is spreading awareness and getting the message heard, a mix of positivity would be beneficial.</p>

<p>Then there are the things I've seen. Government officials violating their own imposed measures. If the risk was so great, they would not be taking those risks. Their negligence clearly shows there are 2 sets of rules and the risk is far overblown. </p>
<p>Irregularities in number of reported positives. Every death called a covid death even if not the causal factor. </p>
<p>Listening to them talk. Even after receiving both boosters they say we will still need to distance and mask. The vaccine will not prevent you from getting it or from spreading it (but is 95% effective against symtpoms) when some people have to take a test to even know they have it. </p>
<p>Mortality rates. Look them up. </p>
<p>California as a case study. Full lockdown measures and obscene numbers of positive cases. Compare to states of equal populations with less or no restrictions. </p>
<p>Shall I continue or is this enough to research on your own yet to form your own opinion?</p>

        <p>First of all, thank you for being the only one giving an actual answer and not be like "uhh it's my own body" or "you're a sheep", so first link talks only about cloth masks, which is something i know aswell isn't very effective and a lot of doctors reccomend not to get those but people find them more comfortable. Yt video, idk much about Fauci, all i know is that this issue isn't only about him or America, if it was then we wouldn't be doing the same stuff over here in Europe, unless America controls us aswell and we didn't know about that but it is very unlikely, also it would take huge amounts of effort to make every doctor in the world to 100% agree on something when it isn't true or it's wrong in some sort of way and no one says anything about it except for a few. I don't get what's wrong with the third link? I honestly don't speak english so well when it comes to medical stuff so i wanna ask what "RT-PCR reagents on open systems." The open systems means cause i honestly don't know, also like WHO is telling how to use them the correct way, nothing hidden to the public.</p>
<p>Governments often make mistakes on this, literally every country is managing the situation poorly, that's mainly because it's a new situation for everyone, stuff like this happens every about 100 years and we're lucky it isn't as lethal as the previous pandemics, in every single one, some people didn't believe it at all even with evidence or thought it wasn't as bad as others say, why? Cause it's a new situation to them, something that changes the way they live daily and it's normal for us to not like it, others take it this way and they just decide not to believe it or not make it as bad as it seems just to continue living as they normally would, i know these are different times but the story is always the same. Tell me more about the third one btw cause i honestly didn't get it well.</p>

        <p>The man in the YouTube video is Kari Mullis. He created the PCR tests they are using for Covid-19. The tests are not designed for diagnostic purposes and when you run them over a certain number of cycles, they will falsely show positive. This is not new information. However, the WHO decided to inform the global Healthcare community of this conveniently at the same time the vaccine is starting distribution. Why? Because there will be many more negative tests when they conduct the tests at the suggested rate in the article. </p>
<p>The first link is to show that cloth masks do not prevent spread. If a "respected source" like the CDC is using terminology like "may" or "might" and not "will" or "must", that means there is insufficient evidence to prove they work. The conclusion states there has only been one randomized controlled trial conducted to examine cloth mask efficacy. 1 actual scientific study. They also state more trials "should" be conducted. The masks are filthy. Constantly touched and sometimes not worn properly.  You are willing to wear it regardless of these facts? Why?</p>
<p>Governments do often make mistakes. Something of this magnitude with this much coordination between countries is not a happenstance mistake. There is a coordinated effort to spread fear and continue these lockdown measures for as long as possible. Again, research the state of California and compare to the state of Florida. I cannot speak for other countries, only for what I see in my own. </p>
<p>In 1918 there were mask mandates in places for the Spanish flu. There was also an Anti-Mask League that fought against the measures and won in some cases. The issue we are seeing is an inability to even debate the things I have pointed out to you. Free thinkers who are researching these anomalies are being ostracized and the majority seem to have no desire to regain their livelihoods or even question the narrative. It is alarming to me. I only speak for myself and nobody else.</p>

        <p>Well the huge harm caused by lockdowns is rather apparent when you think about it. People will lose their jobs, the businesses they worked hard for for many years, and the result can be losing their home and not being able to support themselves or their families. This has plunged millions into poverty, and people will die. Unemployment checks aren't being given to everyone who needs it, and those who are getting them often don't get enough to support themselves. And there aren't enough food banks to go round. Really, all of these people should never have been forced to need a foodbank in the first place!</p>
<p>Then there's the issue with medical appointments being pushed back. People aren't getting the check ups they need and very serious diseases such as cancer are caught too late. I've heard about people seriously struggling to breathe being turned away from hospitals since they wouldn't put on a mask. It's as if we've forgotten about anyone suffering unless they have covid!</p>
<p>Not to mention the consequences on the mental health of people. You can't take away someone's whole life and expect them to just be fine. Humans are social, banning social interaction is really bad for our well being. This leads to a huge increase in mental illness and, as a consequence, suicides. Young people are losing decades of their lives to the despair of seeing no end to this, losing their lives to our response to the virus when they're at no risk from the virus itself. It's tragic! And the young people who come out the other side with be paying for the economic damage for years to come.</p>
<p>Entire industries thrown to the wayside - hospitality, the arts, performing, entertainment, tourism, the list goes on... And though you could argue "lives over the economy", you can't, because lives <em>rely</em> on the economy. Hurt the economy and people's lives take a direct hit too. Not all will survive.</p>
<p>And last of all, the joy of life. The spontaneity and excitement, the experiences, making memories, doing the things you love, meeting new people and spending time with the ones you love! Why prolong life if you take out the things that people live for? Sure, it may seem a bit dramatic but it's something to think about, anyhow. Remember that our ancestors fought and died for our rights and freedom. Don't let us be the generation to give it away!</p>
<p>As for masks, they are ineffective. <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817">RCT study from Denmark. </a></p>
<p>The effects of masks are statistically insignificant, so do not justify mandates. However, I do just see that they should be a choice, not that people should be told not to wear them the way they are currently told they must.</p>
<p>The consequences of masks are not as stark, but they do exist:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Being able to understand facial expressions is crucial to children developing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The social consequences of struggling to communicate due to not being able to see the other half of your face</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The social divide they have created. People will yell at others for not wearing masks in the street, labelling others selfish because of what they put on their face. This creates unnecessary tension and hate. It can happen the other way around too, just not as commonly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The environmental damage from disposable masks. Cloth masks are less effective (due to the spaces in between the fabric, being reused and not being made for medical purposes) but disposable masks end up in the ocean adding hugely to our plastic waste problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The potential harms of bad hygiene involving masks. In medical settings, masks are used properly and very hygienically. However, the standards employed within medical settings simply cannot be employed in the rest of the world. This results in masks being used without considering the hygiene harms they may cause, giving bacteria a moist, warm breeding ground right under your nose.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, thanks for reading, I hope I could help answer your question!</p>
