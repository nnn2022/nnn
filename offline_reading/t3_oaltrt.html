    <strong>The bayesian trap</strong>
    <p><p>Some useful statistics knowledge, to put numbers into perspective.</p>
<p>I possess a test that can tell with 99.7% accuracy whether you have AIDS or not. It goes like this: Somebody asks me whether they have AIDS and I simply reply "no" without even examining them. My answer will be correct 99.7% of the time because that's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_HIV/AIDS_adult_prevalence_rate">prevalence</a> of AIDS in the US, yet my "test" is completely useless in actually diagnosing AIDS since..it performs no diagnoses at all.</p>
<p>Lesson 1: A test's accuracy is meaningless without also knowing the prevalence of the thing it's testing for.</p>
<p>Example: I did a quick Google search regarding the accuracy of PCR tests and different numbers come up depending on the brand of test and the study performed, but they were in the ballpark of 97%. Now let's just <strong>assume</strong> (for the example's sake) that Covid has a prevalence of 1%, i.e. that any given moment, 1% of the population are infected with Covid. If we tested 1000 people, we would get:</p>
<ul>
<li>All 10 sick people (1% of 1000) would be correctly diagnosed with Covid.</li>
<li>Of the remaining 990 healthy people, 30 (3% of 990) would be falsely diagnosed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The test would report 40 sick people, i.e. it would over-report the actual Covid cases by 4x.</p>
<p>Lesson 2: For a test to be meaningful its accuracy should be an order of magnitude higher than the prevalence of what it's testing for. I.e. if a disease has a prevalence of 10%, we want our test to be at least 99% accurate; if it has a prevalence of 1%, we want our test to be at least 99.9% accurate. This also works the other way around: If our test has an accuracy of 97%, for it to give meaningful answers, the prevalence needs to be at least ~30%.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgWNtlz-2vM">Great video on the UNintuitiveness of statistics, how powerful they can be, but also how easily they are abused to misrepresent things - by Zach Star</a></p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This post is not to discredit PCR tests. We used <em>example</em> numbers and skimped over important details such as differentiating between false positives and false negatives (both of which are associated with their own accuracy). The point was to illustrate how UNintuitive statistics/combinatorics can be, to put things into perspective, to teach you something new, and to make you curious to educate yourself more on the subject.</p></p>

        <p>I've seen estimates of over 75% of the pcr tests being false positives. Pcr shouldn't be used to diagnose at all since it doesnt tell you the amount of viral load; using it in asymptomatic people is completely senseless.</p>
<p>The thing is, the medical field knows about base rates and accuracy/reliability. This madness was always political not scientific.</p>

        <p>PCR test is a particularly bad example because its errors are very asymmetric. There are almost no false positives, and plenty of false negatives.</p>
<p>Positive PCR test means that virus genetic material was found in the sample (otherwise there would be nothing for the test to amplify). Negative PCR test may mean the swab was not performed correctly, or there were not enough copies of the virus in that particular swab location.</p>

        <p>This is why no medical professional should NEVER diagnose a disease based solely on a lab test.  You always need some clinical correlation.</p>
<p>Example, many hospital workers are colonized with MRSA in their noses.  This can be cultured as proof.  None of these people has an actual MRSA infection.  By Covid rules though, all of them would be perscribed antibiotics.  See the problem?</p>

        <p>Essentially doesn't exist.  Even Fauci himself said asymptomatic spread was very rare.  Asymptomatic people don't shed enough virus.  Like the MRSA in my nose.  Not enough is expelled to infect someone.  Now if I had a full blown infection, that'd be different.</p>

        <p>PCR tests are useful for confirming diagnosis- in the hospital. When patients already have typical symptoms of the disease. </p>
<p>No idea how many false positives there are in ‚Äúasymptomatic‚Äù people.</p>
