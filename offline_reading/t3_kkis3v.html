        <p>Everything always shuts down almost completely in my area for Christmas, even grocery stores. This is normal.</p>
<p>That being said, except for early in the morning there was plenty of traffic on the roads. To me that says a lot of people were still seeing their families which is a good thing! We didn’t have a “spike” after Thanksgiving and we won’t for Christmas either.</p>

Once that was done, covid was done.  Go thank your democratic overlords for their service in eradicating the elderly.</p>

        <p>It's almost as if that's what precautions are for. In case that something is actually a threat. In case something actually goes wrong and people get injured, or even killed.</p>
<p>Also, 2% death rate is a figure I see you guys often parroting. You claim to care about human rights, yet you don't understand simply surviving is not living. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects.html">This article</a> shows the current long term effects of COVID-19. The virus can <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-long-term-effects/art-20490351">seriously damage the lungs, heart, and brain</a>. This can lead to long term health problems and further complications in life, especially for children, but we don't know what could happen because these effects haven't been studied yet. Also, the reason why the death rate is so low proportionally is because countries are actually taking these precautions, which make COVID-19 less of a threat - most of the high-risk groups are being protected: so fewer deaths. The new vaccine will definitely be helpful, if <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00056803.htm">the polio vaccine</a> was anything to go off of.</p>
<p>But, fewer deaths doesn't mean a small number of people are dying. Considering the total of 79.9 million cases,</p>
<p>79.9 x 0.02 or 2% of 79.9 = 1.598M, or roughly 1.6M</p>
<p>As of today, the actual number of deaths is 1.75 million, though. Just because the death rate is small proportionately doesn't mean it's a small number. And this is my argument against your claim that COVID-19 is not a threat because of its death rate.</p>
<p>Also, I hope people will actually try to debate with me rather than simply downvoting like gormless, spineless cowards with no actual fire (as this sub prides itself a lot on being rebellious) because this argument doesn't agree with their own opinions.</p>
<p>Edit: We've got two gormless, spineless cowards with no fire so far. Lets hope no more come!</p>

        <p>I see you're confused between CFR and IFR.  CRF = case fatality rate (# deaths/# confirmed cases).   IFR = infection fatality rate (# deaths/# infections).  It is pretty much impossible for ever case to be detected for one reason or another, so yes CFR might be 2%, but it's an almost useless statistic because not everyone is getting tested when they're sick.  IFR varies by age, but for all ages is estimated at 0.23% (the flu is about 0.1%).  For &lt;70 years old IFR for COVID-19 is 0.05%.  Also, it's impossible to determine long-term effects with hardly a year of data and also many are now actually recovering and this doens't seem abnormal for a respiratory illness.  IMO instead of wasting time and energy on snitch hotlines and enforcing arbitrary rules, we would be better off focusing on protecting the vulnerable populations; people have become afraid of dying from diseases as if before March 2020 there wasn't diseases that would kill you.</p>

        <p>First of all - thank you for being the first person to actually use citations and give me sources. </p>
<p>The IFR point is valid, but it should be noted that it can vary a lot according to location (your Stanford study says 0.20% to 0.57%, <a href="https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20201030/covid-19-infection-fatality-ratio-is-about-one-point-15-percent">another study</a> from the Imperial College of London says 1.15% to 0.20%). And, the IFR is an estimate. But even if we use the IFR, the deaths are still similar to the CFR. In October, WHO <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-who-estimates-10-of-global-population-infected-with-covid-19/a-55162783">estimated 10% of the world population</a> would be infected by COVID. The current population was around 7.8 billion. Doing some math, we can find that: </p>
<p>7.8 billion x 0.10 = 780 million </p>
<p>780 million x 0.0023 = 1.79 million deaths</p>
<p>The IFR is 1.79 million deaths (which is worse) and the CFR is 1.75 million. So, yeah, the deaths estimated are similar to the deaths confirmed. Nice that medical professionals can do their jobs well. Because the death rate is lower though, it means that the virus has a higher infection rate than confirmed. Which is why COVID-19 is a real threat.  </p>
<p>Also, the CFR is not useless, because it gives us a solid figure among confirmed cases. </p>
<p>Also, that's what I said - long term effects can't be determined with a year of data. It may have been unclear (sorry), but the first time I mentioned them I was referring to side effects of getting the virus that could stay with the recovered patients. These would be visible in months or weeks. The second time I mentioned them I was referring to any conditions that could only be found over say, 20 years or so. Like decreased lifetime or increased risk of immunodeficiency, etc. </p>
<p>Thirdly, (and I acknowledge that this bit is your opinion, so this bit here's mine) the reason people are scared of dying from diseases since March 2020 is because of the infection rate. The rules you're speaking of - I'm assuming lockdowns and mandatory mask-wearing - are there to protect the vulnerable populations. It's there to prevent the spread of a very contagious virus, which is what we have to protect those immunodeficient, infant, and senior individuals from. And we need them. But again, an opinion, no more.</p>

        <p>I'm looking at the study link you provided, but I'm not able to find it peer-reviewed and published anywhere.  It appears to be a "report" and they do provide their code, but I am not qualified to  review it.  That estimate doesn't seem consistent with the CDC's own <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html#table-1">estimate</a> or the or <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2918-0#Fig2">this</a>.

<p>Sure, but there are other diseases that can produce long-term effects.  An overwhelming majority recover with no issues.   Again, there's no solid evidence of long-term effects, so it's not fair to make assumptions.</p>

<p>The problem is there is so much hysteria and mass-fear leftover from the initial panic.   Lockdowns were the immediate solution and their effectivity was never-questioned.   Where is the data saying lockdowns work?  I was in FL a few weeks ago where there's little to no restrictions and everything is open.  Hospitals are fine there.  Meanwhile other states (looking at CA, under very strict lockdown) hospitals are overflowing.  Who is deciding we need to lockdown?  It certainly isn't being voted on by the people.  Governors are acting as dictators and have essentially unchecked power since March.  Maybe they have corned themselves in because if they let up and admit lockdowns aren't needed people will realize their lives got turned upside down for nothing and if they don't do something or even pretend to do something they will blamed for people dying.   Did anyone ask these vulnerable populations if we should lockdown?  I can tell you all the seniors were out and about doing anything and everything in FL when I was there.  If you were in a nursing home and died today, wouldn't you wish you had been able to see your family the past 9 months instead of being locked in for your own "health"?  Is anyone considering the adverse effects of lockdowns?  I don't know anyone who's died of COVID or even been to the hospital, but I do know 3 people that have committed suicide since March likely because of this.  I also have a lot of friends unemployed, depressed and everyday I hear of more businesses closing.   </p>
<p>I'm not saying we shouldn't take COVID seriously, but when does it end?  When do we determine not to be afraid anymore?  A vaccine?  What if everyone doesn't get it?  How long are we to live like this?  Remember it was just "two weeks"?</p>

        <p>Do you realise how many people die in a perfectly normal year? </p>
<p>Do you realise that there are no excess deaths for this time of the year?</p>

<li>Yes, I do. It's around 7.5 percent (577 million). This is from all forms of mortality, including natural disasters, wars, famine, all diseases (chronic, infectious, immunodeficiency. etc.), gunshot wounds, defenestration, execution, suicide, homicide, et cetera, et cetera. The point is not that a single strand of the coronavirus family can cause 1.75 million deaths (which it can and already has). It's the infection rate of COVID-19 that is the cause for lockdowns, mask mandates, social distancing, and all restrictions. Because even if you probably won't die, there are people who face a high chance of dying if they come into contact with an infected person or surface. This is all to protect them. </li>
<li>I seriously don't get this question. You mean, COVID deaths or normal deaths? </li>
<li>No. Other respiratory diseases are still being diagnosed and treated (in countries and hospitals where they can afford it). The NHS is still treating for things like avian flu and pneumonia. </li>
<li>There have been no official reports of false positives, so could I have a source? I have seen stories of false negatives, though. COVID tests take time, and sometimes individuals catch it between the test date and the result date. These are just personal stories from victims, though. </li>
<li>Lockdowns accomplish quite a lot. The environment is healing because smog emission levels are down. The periods of quarantine allow the virus to be overcome by those who have it and prevent spreading. It restricts people from public areas where the virus would be spread like a wildfire. It also has a lot of personal benefits - people can explore hobbies, get more sleep, and more. </li>
<li>Yes I do. But I believe that while there are negative impacts, lockdown is necessary because it prevents the loss of human life. The economy can be saved later, after the pandemic is over. </li>
<li>Nope. Because I look at official medical reports and even if this pandemic does turn out to be a hoax and nobody died, I won't care because my intention was to prevent the loss of human life. </li>
<li>A bit difficult, because I don't have a single news source. The closest thing I have is WHO reports, and I don't think I should give that up.</li>

<p>Good so you realise the death numbers are nowhere near as scary as doomers like to make them sound. 300,000 american deaths, 1.6million worldwide deaths sounds like a lot, but just isn't. Particularly when you realise the average age of death for a covid patient is higher than normal life expectancy, and that for people under 45 there is literally no excess death this year at all. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I mean the total number of deaths are within normal ranges. The fact that there a lot of deaths being recorded as covid deaths is not impacting total deaths (it did at the peak of the epidemic between March and May). Add in the fact that we always expect a growing number of deaths year on year from a  growing/ageing population and the death numbers from this thing are radically unimpressive. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Very few respiratory diseases other than covid are being recorded, particularly as causes of death. Far far fewer than in a normal year - because covid has become the alpha predator of respiratory diseases. People who would have died from flu are dying from covid (and/or being diagnosed with covid when they have the flu - take your pick). The point is if the total number of deaths are within normal ranges, what on earth is the point of the panic?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>https://lockdownsceptics.org/?s=false+positives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why on earth are you talking about emission levels. Utterly irrelevant tripe. And no they literally accomplish nothing. It is impossible for Britain's lockdowns to have been responsible for the reduction in the pandemic rates in Summer as the dates do not align - the peak in deaths came 2 weeks after lockdowns were introduced; but covid takes an average of 4 weeks to kill from infection. This is fatal to the case that lockdowns are necessary. Worldwide there is no correlation between severity of restrictions taken in countries and their disease spread (https://inproportion2.talkigy.com/images/ox_correlation_29Apr.png). Even the most ardent of lockdown supporters understand that, at best, they merely kick the can down the road. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lockdowns accomplish nothing; they cause economic devastation and wide-ranging health problems; not to mention the poor socialisation of our young, whose lives are going to be permanently ruined. They are the most immoral, unjustified things I have ever heard of and it boggles my mind that people still support them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you're using the WHO you'll at least be aware of the radical contradictions in their policies, and that they themselves have recently urged governments to stop using lockdowns.</p>

<li>Again, infection rates. Nobody wants you to kill their grandma. It's about preventing future deaths. But the fact stands that the Florida governor pretty much sent the Gestapo for a scientist refusing to underplay actual death numbers. The government is very obviously trying to hide these numbers, especially the Republicans.  </li>
<li>Deaths aren't just a statistic. They're also people. Just because they're normal doesn't mean you wouldn't go out of your way to prevent them </li>
<li>That is because most doctors and nurses are being overworked and have to be constantly suspicious of anybody that may have the disease so that they don't infect the other patients. </li>
<li>Seriously? </li>
<li>Climate change denier much? Also, the reason why the peak came during lockdown was because of people ignoring lockdown. </li>
<li>Benefits of lockdown - people don't die. I don't know how else I can tell you that straighter. </li>
<li>I thought you might laugh at someone trying to actually be a good person. </li>
<li>WHO reports and articles are written by universities. And besides, I don't only read WHO.</li>

<p>So remind me who you think is a conspiracy theorist again?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LOCKDOWNS CAUSE MASSIVE HARM FFS. Do you understand that? For a disease that is not devestating anyone more than the normal season's diseases do we are destroying everything. Understand yet? Lockdowns categorically fail any and all cost-benefit analysis. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>...stop pretending you can explain things when you can't.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the climate conversation is irrelevant regardless of what my stance on that particular issue may be. And no the reason for the peaks is that the disease is a seasonal virus and will peak with the seasons all across the world; all the data is consitent with it and it will remain consistent with it over the coming year; meanwhile people will panic in witner when it comes back and celebrate in summer when it goes away oblivious to this obvious reality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>False. I can't make this clearer. People are the udner the delusion that lockdowns magically save lives but they do no such thing. There is no evidence whatsoever that they do this.  Indeed it was never the point.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>7...well you're failing. Lockdowns are immoral, ruin lives and accomplish nothing. If you actually to be a good person you would be doing everything in your power to oppose them.</p>
<ol>
<li>whoop de doo.</li>

        <p>Covid has only been around a year, so how could you possibly know the long-term effects? Are you from the future?  Also, the only death rate that matters in US is our own death rate, far lower than most of the world despite our own far larger population.</p>

        <p>Sorry, I must have not made that bit clear</p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects.html">This article</a> shows the current long term effects of COVID-19. The virus can <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-long-term-effects/art-20490351">seriously damage the lungs, heart, and brain</a></p>
<p>- Current long term effects, meaning over a period of a few months or weeks initially. Then later,</p>
<p>&rt;This can lead to long term health problems and further complications in life, especially for children, but we don't know what could happen because these effects haven't been studied yet</p>
<p>It means the long term effects over lifetimes, such as increased risk of immunodeficiency.</p>
<p>Also, for the US, the death rate is still roughly 2%. It is a significantly lower number since we're only counting one country, but I wouldn't say 330,000 deaths (18.8 million total cases) is anything to sneeze at. Especially considering the US (population 600 million) has 43% of the population of India (population 1.38 billion). Yet India has 10 million cases and roughly 150,000 deaths. That's more than double the population yet less than half the deaths. The poverty rate is around 68.8% and, as someone who lives in India, the slums can be incredibly unhygienic and not have access to basic utilities. Yet somehow we have less than half the cases of the <a href="https://www.ghsindex.org/">Number 1 Most Prepared Country of the 2019 GHS Index</a>. Kiiiiiiinda embarrassing.</p>

        <p>I developed lifelong side effects from Lyme Disease. My father in law developed lifelong side effects from H1N1. We’re both on medication indefinitely and have daily medical struggles. No one gave a shit about those of us with long lasting illness symptoms until now, and even now it’s only if you have Covid. Grow up.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is the WuFlu isn't deadly enough to warrant ANY of these precautions. It simply has a media campaign, with an inflated death count.</p>
