        <p>The rich - the <em>really</em> rich - are unaffected by wealth taxes. Capital can move around the world or change form in seconds. One minute it's cash; the next it's art; then it's a gift; then it's a house; then it's equity; then it's bonds, then it's cash again. Taxmen can't follow, and the owner may not even know: wealth managers do all this.</p>
<p>When governments say "we'll target the rich!", what they naturally mean is they'll target those they can reach, and that means anyone whose work or luck allows them a little luxury. It means people doing relentless overtime. It means people with investments. It means people who inherited a second home, or got a large pension from decades of public service. It means us, or people a stone's throw away from us. Musk and Bezos are unaffected.</p>

        <p>This is the sort of thing I'm afraid of. I'm not rich, but I'm more comfortable than most. Of course, almost all Americans are. A lot of ingrates don't realize how good they have it. I don't want to be equal with the rest of the world.</p>

        <p>Don't fall for this headline. This is a mess.</p>
<p>Argentina is a beautiful country, but its economy is unstable and - after one of the longest lockdowns in the world - is in shambles. This won't help to fix the problem at all.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't expect this to help, but they had a plan and look over there, a convenient excuse to implement it.</p>

        <p>What I think many people donâ€™t understand is the fact that net worth does not necessarily equate to lots of cash sitting around doing nothing.  Most wealthy people have a significant portion of their net worths tied up in the values of their assets such as their home and businesses.</p>
