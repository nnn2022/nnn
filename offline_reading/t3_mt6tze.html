        <p>the thing about him...is that everyone in California fucking hates him...</p>
<p>from State of Jefferson to Tijuana border area, Republican/Democrat, old/young</p>
<p>This shithead is basically like Mac on It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia when he says "I'm playing BOTH sides so I always come out on top"</p>
<p>Also, never trust a politician from San Francisco. They're all corrupt as hell (DA Chesa Boudin is largely responsible for creating the infrastructure for allowing innocent 80 year old Asians to get beat and robbed in broad daylight in SF)</p>

        <p>nah dude, I live in the Bay Area where they worship the "fauci ouchie" (look at how many posts are on r/bayarea about it) and people were unanimously furious at him the past year because he kept flip-flopping with our color-coded tier system for re-opening stuff back up</p>
<p>last summer they were trying to ban the beach FFS, everyone broke that rule even while wearing masks. Thousands of small businesses got shut down and he couldn't be bothered. Even sherriffs in LA County openly admitted to not being willing to enforce the mask laws last year toward the fall.</p>
<p>it's pretty obvious that Newsome is just using his position as governor of California to catapult himself into an even bigger political platform</p>
