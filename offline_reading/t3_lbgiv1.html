    <strong>Good conversation this evening.</strong>
    <p><p>My "help" came in this afternoon (part time guy, couple/few days a week, I let him make his own schedule). He had mentioned last week that he was going to head out the beach (Washington, couple hours away) this weekend, just for the day, and he had a good follow-up.</p>
<p>Just to preface, he had the full tilt version of Covid over Thanksgiving, tested positive after being obviously positive, and the rest is what it is.... </p>
<p>That being said, as of early January, he stopped participating in the charade, and has been completely, unapologetically mask free everywhere for a month. He has gotten his hair cut, ate out, the works, all without a face covering.... He just says no.</p>
<p>The cool part of the conversation was that he finally got confronted in general Sunday... The first guy was stocking shelves at the store at 5am, was the only real person he ran across until the cashier, and he got asked if he had a mask. My guy said "Nope, I don't wear those." The guy stocking the shelves (who was an immigrant, he didn't say where from or what ethnicity), said "good, I wish I didn't have to wear this shit"... "I didn't move to America to have somebody tell me what to do". That was a good moment in general for both of them. Next situation was when he got to the beach, him and his company went to eat outdoors, but first you had to travel through the restaurant, which required a mask, and he said nope. Well prepared to walk out, they just walked him through.</p>
<p>Moral of the story is this:</p>
<p>Stand up and quit being a pussy, take your mask off, and be prepared to walk out. Also be prepared to come across people who don't care and respect the hell out of you for having some balls... Nobody confronts people with balls.</p></p>

        <p>It's definitely a confidence thing.  It's not size, I'm a small guy; but it's most definitely body language, posture and confidence.  I've always been small but I've never been hassled.  Well, you know what I mean, not never.</p>

        <p>For me, I like to just act as normal and confident as I can. Oh, and I smile at literally everyone I make eye contact with. No, not a fake smile, a real, genuine one. I want people to remember what it's like to see someone's face, but more importantly, a happy face.</p>

<p>For reference, I live 20 miles from Seattle, and don't wear shit. If somebody wants to kick me out, let them show their cards.</p>
<p>The sign on the window doesn't mean anything other than king Inslee has ordered his directive. The majority of businesses won't even question you, and if they do, just tell them no. They will take a sale over confrontation..</p>

<p>My wife has noticed some scoffing her way, but nothing more than petty BS. Unless it's worthy of commenting on, she just laughs and walks away.</p>
<p>Vancouver is Portland, so I can see it, but the point stays the same.</p>

        <p>I am. It seems people feel safer picking on weak women than on men. That why I keep a taser and knife on me at all times. As far as Vancouver vs Portland yeah it's close, on a scale of 1-100 of normal to woke/covid insanity if Portland is 100 than Vancouver is 85 maybe 95, somewhere in that range.</p>

        <p>You just have to confront it head on. Laugh it off until it's serious, then say "No, Fuck you!" And walk away... If they pursue it, it's no different than somebody that's harassing you for any other reason.</p>

        <p>Yeah, he knows the way. No more masks. I’m not wearing one, not to avoid dirty looks, not to avoid being asked to leave. I’m mature enough that o can ignore dirty looks, and I am prepared to leave if asked and spend my $$ elsewhere. I will smile politely as I exit. See ya!</p>
