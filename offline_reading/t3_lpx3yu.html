    <strong>I have some thoughts on the forced vaccine thing...</strong>
    <p><p>The other day I was thinking about us people who don't want the vaccine and I have a thought:  if push does come to shove, then how many will give in?  If life does become a lot harder for the "vaccine deniers", then I really do wonder how many will be prepared to stick to their values and not cave to the state.  It just worries me a bit that many won't uphold their values, and only a very, very small percent of people will still resist against this insanity.  It would be interesting to see how many would actually hold the line.</p></p>

        <p>I don’t know how you can look at what’s happened to our civil liberties over the course of this last year and make a statement like that so confidently. They don’t have to write an actual law to make it mandatory but they sure as hell can coerce us to get it. Want to go to a concert? Vaccination papers please. Want to go to a ball game? Vaccination papers please. Want to attend University? Vaccination papers please. Want to get on that plane? Vaccination papers please. Want to shop in this mall? Vaccination papers please.</p>

        <p>And all these places trying to enforce vaccine papers will suffer massive profit loss and will drop the idea of vaccine checks.</p>
<p>People forget business are all about their bottom line and once thats impacted they will cave.</p>

        <p>Once they make it hard to make money without a vax, many will fall. It's a sad reality but I don't blame people for trying to survive</p>
<p>Still, I don't see it getting that bad right away. It feels like the groundwork is being laid out, but I think they'll want a stronger majority of public support first. At this rate, it really won't take long but with how all the changes have been rushed lately, I'm hopeful more people will wake up to their slaughter.</p>

        <p>It's definitely not going to happen tomorrow or probably even this year. Honestly it isn't about the vaccine itself so the final nail in our coffins probably won't even be a vaccine mandate itself... They're just laying the groundwork, as you said.</p>

        <p>Turned down 3 jobs so far due to their new company policies, all new hires have to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>As a nurse, I knew this was coming. I have hopes a job will come through without the vaccine mandate policy. I have enough savings to get by for some time, but I'm fully prepared to leave healthcare if I have to and live a simpler life.</p>
<p>I'm not anti-vax. I have all my vaccinations, minus the flu shot. With the Covid vaccine, its the principle of it being mandated despite not being studied enough for a virus with a nearly 99% survivability. The Covid vaccine won't stop me from catching or spreading it and I still would have to wear an N95 all shift... so really what's the point of pushing it on me. </p>
<p>Sometimes I feel like I'd rather just die than do these forced pointless mandates any longer, so over it.</p>

        <p>A lot will cave, sadly. That's humanity and survival instinct. </p>
<p>Many of us won't and the percentage will be so small that we'll be ousted from society, at the very least, but probably much worse... And you just, gotta accept that how and be prepared as you possibly can and find like minded people.
From the very beginning I've been open about the fact that I will flee when need be to keep my family safe and that under no circumstances will we be caving to theater...so it's just not even an option.</p>
<p>I'm nervous. I'm on a medication for my mental health I'll no longer have access to. A lot of us will die from dumb, simple shit like tooth infections or a UTI. Some will starve to death. All these things that no longer kill people in developed countries ? That's going to be the death of us <em>if</em> we are simply ousted and denied all goods and services. 
But what other choice do we have ? None. 
If you are really serious then recognize now that you have no other choice, no other option, and that they will intentionally and steadily make life harder and harder until as many as they can eventually give in. Don't give it...it is not an option, period. 
They will come to force their weird tyranny onto us. They'll come into homes to try and take our children, they'll burn books, turn off access to goods, they will be openly violent. Do what you have to do, but don't give up.</p>
<p>Make peace now with the fact you may actually die for your values but who are you if you don't ?</p>

        <p>I drew the line with masks. That's how I know I won't take the vaccine. That's the trick. They start with the little things and it slowly increases until all of the sudden you're in front of Mr. Hyde getting injected with covid goo. Tyranny 101.</p>
<p>There is a good chunk of people on here who hate masks but still wear them just to avoid harassment. These are the people who will most likely take the vaccine if their home or job is threatened. In their minds they have too much to lose not knowing eventually they'll end up losing it all the same <em>AND</em> they cooperated.</p>

        <p>I gave this a lot of thought also and something a family member said too "if the number of cases are coming down 77% as they say it is here in the US, there is no reason to get vaxx'd" and to be quite honest, what they want to do and what they push for is completely different than what will happen in reality, they can never mandate a vaxx to be mandatory.</p>
