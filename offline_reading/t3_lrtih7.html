    <strong>I'd like to compile a list of lies and nonsense</strong>
    <p><p>I want to compile a grand list of all the things they have done and said to make this obvious as bullshit. If anyone has any other examples they want to add to this list, please do so. It could be from blatantly false predictions, to lies, to rules that make literally no sense. I think it would be nice to have just everything in one "document". So without further ado, here's my prelim list off the top of my head of all the bullshit that this pandemic has had so far:</p>
<p>-"Two weeks to Flatten the Curve."</p>
<p>-"2 million will be dead by the end of May."</p>
<p>-Liquor stores are somehow considered essential but gyms aren't.</p>
<p>-Covid only comes out at night apparently, which is why businesses closed earlier.</p>
<p>-Stores have arrows on the floor, because Covid only travels in one direction.</p>
<p>-Covid won't bother you while you eat, but if you stand up, you just killed someone's grandma.</p>
<p>-The false positive tests.</p>
<p>-The fact that Hollywood is magically considered essential.</p>
<p>-Non-Covid deaths being attributed to Covid.</p>
<p>-The fact that most of the businesses considered "essential" JUST SO HAPPEN to be big business.</p>
<p>-Politicians' haircuts always looked fresh despite the closures of salons and barbershops.</p>
<p>-There has been virtually no focus whatsoever on actual HEALTH.</p>
<p>-They claimed that the only reason 2M didn't die in May is because of the lockdowns, but they then say that the only reason there are still cases is because people aren't following the lockdowns.</p>
<p>-They say that lockdowns are necessary and work, yet CA is a complete epicenter despite having the strictest and longest running lockdowns.</p>
<p>-Let's not forget how Cuomo outright murdered people in nursing homes.</p>
<p>-When the democrats gathered to burn down cities it was cool and actually helped slow the spread but if people got together for labor day, it was superspreading!</p>
<p>This is just off the top of my head but I know there are way more. Please help me add to this list! I will add them as they come.</p></p>

        <p>-Stores can only have 1 entrance/exit open because apparently people all being forced through one door will help slow the spread.</p>
<p>-Since viral spread is such a grandma killer it only makes sense to close all public restrooms so no one can wash their hands.</p>
