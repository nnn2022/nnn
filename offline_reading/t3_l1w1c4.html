    <strong>A critical analysis and thoughtful critique of the Canadian government’s response to the COVID-19 crisis.</strong>
    <p><p>It has been about a year since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>
<p>In the time that has passed humanity has been forced to bear an extraordinary amount of suffering.</p>
<p>But what if I was to propose that not all the suffering that has occurred was necessary?</p>
<p>In fact that is what I am here to propose. I believe that a massive amount of the suffering that has occurred could have been avoided had our government and health officials acted more rationally, more honestly and in better faith.</p>
<p>For starters, the authoritarian lockdowns that they have put into place are unprecedented, do an incredible amount more harm than good and are completely unwarranted.</p>
<p>There are so many much more reasonable and rational methods of going about implementing guidelines in order to limit the spread of COVID-19. </p>
<p>Putting provinces into harmful lockdowns as if we need to eradicate the virus from our society or come near is a completely unreasonable approach for several reasons: first off, our goal regarding this virus should not be that any cases that pop up are a sign of failure and that we must shut everything down upon any hint of the virus emerging.</p>
<p>As time progresses it has become very obvious that this virus is something that is here to stay and is something that we will need to learn to live around and adapt to. </p>
<p>It’s simply not feasible to shut everything down until nobody catches COVID anymore.
It’s just not possible and no amount of lockdowns will accomplish that goal, in fact all they do is temporarily reduce cases for a short while at the price of the mental, financial and emotional well-being of the population upon which they are inflicted.</p>
<p>That is why every single lockdown up until this point has been a complete failure in terms of stopping the virus from just re-emerging as soon as the lockdown ends. (And in a lot of cases, it was ineffective in stopping it from spreading as well.) </p>
<p>So the way that I see it, lockdowns are just delaying the inevitable in terms of the virus re-emerging and causing unbelievable amounts of avoidable harm in the meantime.</p>
<p>These lockdowns have absolutely devastating effects on the populations upon which they are forced.</p>
<p>-First off, they cause mental health issues such as depression, drug addiction and suicide to skyrocket to unparalleled levels.
Instead of just dealing with a pandemic, the government has made it so we are also dealing with a drug addiction crisis and a mental health crisis as well.</p>
<p>-Secondly, they absolutely destroy the economies wherever they are implemented and raise levels of poverty substantially. 
Our government is stopping small businesses from generating any revenue or any ability to provide, along with stopping massive amounts of people from working and forcing them to live off of measly stimulus checks, all while allowing corporate giants to stay open and rack in more money than ever due to lack of competition.</p>
<p>Think about this for a second: a giant box store owned by a corporation is allowed to stay open and generate tons and tons of revenue, while a ma and pa store of the same nature is forced to remain closed. 
There is a massive amount of transmission that occurs at these box stores and corporate locations so it cannot be summed up to the small businesses being more dangerous. That is obviously false.</p>
<p>Why should small businesses be forced to bend the knee to the state while corporate giants stay open, when the citizens running these small businesses usually rely on the revenue generated by their businesses to provide for their families, keep their businesses running and pay their rents to avoid eviction? </p>
<p>The small business owners obviously need revenue during this time of crisis much more than any corporation, so why exactly are they the ones being forced to remain closed? </p>
<p>What is going on makes no logical sense in terms of the state having the best interest of it’s own citizens in mind. A simple cost-benefit analysis done by anybody with a degree of intelligence would conclude that these restrictions and measures are doing far more harm than they are doing good, as well as doing far too much harm to a population that had no say in the matter than is justified.</p>
<p>I think the government is quite obviously pandering to corporations and causing serious harm to many of it’s citizens in an absolutely malevolent and reprehensible display of willful negligence and quite honestly, tyranny.</p>
<p>The measures they have and are still in the process of taking are obviously deeply flawed, yet the government and health officials refuse to acknowledge them as such and instead choose to double down on measures that were fatally flawed and doomed to fail since the day of their conception.</p>
<p>The government and health officials are causing unnecessary harm and suffering to the public for no good reason and for that, I think their actions during this time of crisis will forever be immortalized as unreasonable, unjustifiable and tyrannical at their core.</p>
<p>During a time of crisis it is the job of our leaders to actively attempt to aid the population in reducing their suffering and provide support to those in need, not to put measures in place that cause our society to crumble from the inside out starting with the finances, minds and hearts of our citizens dealing with this time of crisis.</p>
<p>This gross negligence regarding the suffering they are causing our citizens is an unforgivable display of malice towards those who they claim to be trying to protect. </p>
<p>Those we hail are wolves in sheep’s clothing, preying upon our fear and our compliance as well as using our faith and trust in them to slowly lead us towards lives of quiet desperation and suffering. </p>
<p>They are using these lockdowns to break us in every way, killing us financially by not allowing us to make a living, killing us mentally and emotionally by forcing perfectly healthy people to isolate themselves and destroying our social relations.</p>
<p>They are slowly breaking our will and increasing our dependence on the state, as well as keeping people in a perpetual state of fear to keep us compliant when they roll out more and more forms of tyranny and authoritarianism.</p>
<p>Moving forward, I will now lead into the media’s role in what is going on with a brief analysis of the amount of danger that COVID-19 poses to our health.</p>
<p>COVID-19 is a bad flu virus and is dangerous to anybody with preexisting conditions or those who are elderly or in bad health, however the issue is that the true danger of COVID-19 is being blown way out of proportion in order to keep the population in a state of fear and compliance so that they keep going along with the unreasonable and tyrannical restrictions that have been forced upon them.</p>
<p>Here are the recovery rates by age as provided by the CDC: 
0-19: 99.997%
20-49: 99.98%
50-69: 99.5% 
70+: 94.6%</p>
<p>As you can see, this is not a virus that the average person should be afraid of, so the question stands, why are so many people terrified of this virus to the point of giving away rights and freedoms to the state for the empty promise of safety? Well, I think this is where the media comes into play.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the pandemic the media and the government have been non-stop broadcasting a stream of fear and misleading information about the virus and the pandemic.</p>
<p>I say this for a few reasons:</p>
<p>-First off, they are constantly broadcasting about how many new cases there are. 
This is misleading for the reason that the amount of cases showing up should not be a cause of great worry to a sensible person that knows the true amount of danger this virus poses.</p>
<p>We have become convinced there is a way to contain this virus, which there isn’t.</p>
<p>There is a reason that even the places with the strictest lockdowns still have substantial amounts of transmission like California and it’s not because people are breaking the wildly harmful unconstitutional lockdown rules.</p>
<p>It is because viruses spread regardless and even our best efforts will not prevent that. </p>
<p>As I mentioned, this is something we need to learn to live with and work around, not something we should be trying to eradicate or have no presence at all in our society. 
It’s simply not feasible or realistic.</p>
<p>-Secondly, the amount of cases they report is actually wildly inaccurate and they've even come out and said this themselves.</p>
<p>So this isn’t my opinion, this is coming straight from the horse’s mouth.</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/3COXVbP5WdI</p>
<p>Public health physician Dr. Yaffe has come out during a broadcast with Ontario premier Doug Ford and in response to why teachers are not forced to regularly participate in mandatory testing she says, and I quote:</p>
<p>“You know I think a lot of people think the testing is going to really solve the whole problem and it isn’t, it’s one component of a response. If you test somebody today, uh, you only know if they’re infected today. And in fact if you’re testing in a population that doesn’t have very much Covid, you’ll get false positives almost half the time. That is the person actually doesn’t have Covid, they have something else, they may have nothing. Uh, so it will just complicate the picture.”</p>
<p>So what we have here is a public health official that is familiar with the testing, admitting the tests are wrong around up to at least 50% of the time in populations with less Covid. </p>
<p>These tests give absurd amounts of false positives and we have our own public health officials telling us this, then turning around and shoving all the “new Covid cases” in our faces as a reason to enact more lockdown restrictions. 
Are you seeing the inconsistency here? </p>
<p>It seems as though our public health officials will use inaccurate data when it pertains to their agenda and goals without a second thought, essentially misleading the public when it is useful to them.</p>
<p>The implications of Dr. Yaffe’s statement is essentially that in most areas almost half of the new cases they announce are false positives, meaning they are not Covid at all. </p>
<p>This is a clear indication we are being misled by those who claim to have our health and safety as their top priority, which is a laughable claim anyways due to the willfully negligent actions they continue to take in the face of our suffering.</p>
<p>The WHO (world health organization) has even come out against lockdowns, citing the amount of undue harm they cause as the reason, yet our benevolent and caring leaders ignore this evidence and continue to force them on populations without their consent.</p>
<p>These people do not have our health and safety in mind. Their agenda is self-serving and seeks to level the economy and the middle class, leaving a massive divide between the poor and the rich. </p>
<p>The middle class will be levelled and will end up poor and those previously in the lower class will be forced into extreme poverty, leaving a massive gap between the population and the now even richer elites that are pushing for more and more economically, financially, emotionally, mentally and physically destructive lockdowns.</p>
<p>Once this is thoroughly carried out, due to the level of desperation and poverty, when the great reset swoops in to introduce it‘s sneaky form of totalitarian technocracy, we will gladly accept lest we do not disillusion ourselves to the fact that it’s coming and it’s our responsibility to stand up to it.</p>
<p>Clear objection to what is going on is our only hope and our only option to retain our rights and stop this dystopic future from actualizing itself.</p>
<p>Touching on our responsibility during situations like these, I’ll read a short excerpt from a man I greatly admire and has greatly inspired me, Dr. Jordan Peterson.</p>
<p>“Y’know, ya gotta be awake. If you’re in a system there’s gonna be some corruption in it. 
Part of what you’re supposed to do is keep your damn eyes open for the corruption and your mouth speaking truth so when the corruption starts to take root, you object to it so the whole damn system doesn’t turn into a pathological power play. 
And that’s part of your ethical responsibility as a conscious being, an ethical being, a religious being for that matter and a citizen, y’know?
And you’re charged with that, that’s why you vote, that’s why you’re the cornerstone of your state man.
You’re the wellspring of the ethical actions that replenish the dying world, that’s what you are.”</p>
<p>It’s a very powerful quote and it rings true at the deepest level. </p>
<p>At the end of the day it’s up to us, as citizens, as people and as sovereign individuals, to do something about this.</p>
<p>We must object to their actions and demand our rights and freedoms back, for our future, for our children’s future, for our society and for the greater good of humanity at large.</p>
<p>And so, on that note, let us take responsibility, object to tyranny, resist the fear and save the future of our society.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading.</p></p>
