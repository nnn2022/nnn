    <strong>2 years of scamdemic because of PCR testing tricks?</strong>
    <p><p>In August 2020, the New York Times said the PCR test for COVID-19 was being used incorrectly. ‚û°Ô∏è Up to 90 percent of positive tests in three states were actually negative, without sufficient virus to infect anyone ‚¨ÖÔ∏è</p>
<p>The PCR test is a problem. In 2006, a hospital thought it had a whooping cough epidemic. The PCR test found 142 ‚Äúinfected‚Äù workers. But no bacteria grew from the cultures. There was no whooping cough or epidemic.</p>
<p>In 2007, epidemiologist Dr. Trish Perl said the test is a problem and may cause more pseudo-epidemics. Yet PCR tests are being used today for COVID-19. Perhaps that‚Äôs why the New York Times did the study this year. But why has main stream media and government ignored this very important study about false positive results for COVID-19?</p>
<p>‚ÄúFaith in Quick Test Leads to Epidemic That Wasn‚Äôt,‚Äù Gina Kolata, The New York Times, January 22, 2007</p>
<p>P.S. Now Dr. Trish Perl says, when tests are positive, they are good.  But if they are negative, you cannot be assured that the people tested do not have the disease ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p></p>

        <p>The tests are a joke. The president from Tanzania showed the world how useless they are after having a positive jack fruit come back.</p>

        <p>That‚Äôs fact.  Look at what happened with the vaccine rollout in February 2021.  The PCR threshold was at 38 which Fauci himself said anything above 35 was a false positive for anything.</p>
<p>Then vaccine rollout comes about and the threshold is set to 32.</p>

        <p>The whole idea of identifing sickness through PCR is faulty.</p>
<p>Even if that wasnt the case...</p>
<p>You differentiate between flu and corona through testing. There is no other way (according to CDC). But how do you validate a test if you cant distingush the two in the first place? There is no feedback to prove your test to be correctly identifing it.</p>

        <p>It was the start of a bizarre episode at the medical center: the story of the epidemic that wasn‚Äôt.</p>
<p>For months, nearly everyone involved thought the medical center had had a huge whooping cough outbreak, with extensive ramifications. Nearly 1,000 health care workers at the hospital in Lebanon, N.H., were given a preliminary test and furloughed from work until their results were in; 142 people, including Dr. Herndon, were told they appeared to have the disease; and thousands were given antibiotics and a vaccine for protection. Hospital beds were taken out of commission, including some in intensive care.</p>
<p>Then, about eight months later, health care workers were dumbfounded to receive an e-mail message from the hospital administration informing them that the whole thing was a false alarm.</p>
<p>Not a single case of whooping cough was confirmed with the definitive test, growing the bacterium, Bordetella pertussis, in the laboratory. Instead, it appears the health care workers probably were afflicted with ordinary respiratory diseases like the common cold.</p>
<p>Now, as they look back on the episode, epidemiologists and infectious disease specialists say the problem was that they placed too much faith in a quick and highly sensitive molecular test that led them astray.</p>
<p>Infectious disease experts say such tests are coming into increasing use and may be the only way to get a quick answer in diagnosing diseases like whooping cough, Legionnaire‚Äôs, bird flu, tuberculosis and SARS, and deciding whether an epidemic is under way.</p>
<p>There are no national data on pseudo-epidemics caused by an overreliance on such molecular tests, said Dr. Trish M. Perl, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins and past president of the Society of Health Care Epidemiologists of America. But, she said, pseudo-epidemics happen all the time. The Dartmouth case may have been one the largest, but it was by no means an exception, she said.</p>
<p>There was a similar whooping cough scare at Children‚Äôs Hospital in Boston last fall that involved 36 adults and 2 children. Definitive tests, though, did not find pertussis.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a problem; we know it‚Äôs a problem,‚Äù Dr. Perl said. ‚ÄúMy guess is that what happened at Dartmouth is going to become more common.‚Äù</p>

        <p>Many of the new molecular tests are quick but technically demanding, and each laboratory may do them in its own way. These tests, called ‚Äúhome brews,‚Äù are not commercially available, and there are no good estimates of their error rates. But their very sensitivity makes false positives likely, and when hundreds or thousands of people are tested, as occurred at Dartmouth, false positives can make it seem like there is an epidemic.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in a little bit of no man‚Äôs land,‚Äù with the new molecular tests, said Dr. Mark Perkins, an infectious disease specialist and chief scientific officer at the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, a nonprofit foundation supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. ‚ÄúAll bets are off on exact performance.‚Äù</p>
<p>Of course, that leads to the question of why rely on them at all. ‚ÄúAt face value, obviously they shouldn‚Äôt be doing it,‚Äù Dr. Perl said. But, she said, often when answers are needed and an organism like the pertussis bacterium is finicky and hard to grow in a laboratory, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have great options.‚Äù</p>
<p>Waiting to see if the bacteria grow can take weeks, but the quick molecular test can be wrong. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost like you‚Äôre trying to pick the least of two evils,‚Äù Dr. Perl said.</p>
<p>At Dartmouth the decision was to use a test, P.C.R., for polymerase chain reaction. It is a molecular test that, until recently, was confined to molecular biology laboratories.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs kind of what‚Äôs happening,‚Äù said Dr. Kathryn Edwards, an infectious disease specialist and professor of pediatrics at Vanderbilt University. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the reality out there. We are trying to figure out how to use methods that have been the purview of bench scientists.‚Äù</p>
<p>The Dartmouth whooping cough story shows what can ensue.</p>
<p>To say the episode was disruptive was an understatement, said Dr. Elizabeth Talbot, deputy state epidemiologist for the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou cannot imagine,‚Äù Dr. Talbot said. ‚ÄúI had a feeling at the time that this gave us a shadow of a hint of what it might be like during a pandemic flu epidemic.‚Äù</p>

        <p>I have found that any of those tests do not seem to be accurate... remember the "asymptomatic spread" the MSM and these "experts" were peddling. </p>
<p>I do believe COVID is a real virus, but the tests are not accurate.  PCR tests and any others.  The news wants you to believe these "cases" are COVID but they are actually "positive test results" derived from PCR.  I think that some places drive up the cycles to get more "cases".  Like right now in Jacksonville, we have not had a spike and all of the sudden everyone has the virus.. seems odd to me.  I'm also wondering in Florida if certain counties run testing cycles higher and get "cases" as a result of faulty testing.  </p>
<p>My friend had the flu for 13 days but she went and got checked out, and the doctors confirmed she had flu... they didn't test her for COVID.  The symptoms of both are eerily similar.  COVID I think has a stronger loss of taste and smell?  I'm not sure I've never had the virus... anyone I know that did had mild symptoms and said it was like having a cold or the flu.  But we can't justify lockdowns, suicide, forced isolation and masks.</p>
<p>Now they peddle the "Delta" mutant- honestly, it sounds like a summer cold... or allergies.  MSM pushing narratives about allergies being COVID.  They are so disgusting.  As someone who has allergies, I find that offensive and ignorant for them to lie like that.</p>

        <p>Do people not understand how PCR works? Please educate yourself before you start making assumptions.</p>
<p>Running a PCR sample alongside a control of GAPDH or Actin as a reference gene definitely helps in ensuring that your result is accurate. Furthermore, esrly problems with the PCR were due to primer dimer formation, which was rectified through the usage of new primers. So now it‚Äôs a lot more accurate and more difficult to get false negative results.</p>
<p>Also, the difference between 30, 35 and 40 cycles can easily be seen if you use a reference gene. There are tons of protocols out there that use 40 cycles for qPCR for gene knockouts and you can clearly see the difference anywhere from 20 to 40 cycles. As long as you have a viable TM then you are pretty much going to get good data.</p>
<p>If anyone doubts the viability of this, I will be happy to prove PCR data run on gels to show expression differences from 30-40 cycles, or you can also search up papers on Nature.</p>

        <p>I will try and elaborate as much as possible in this comment, although please be warned that this is only derived from my understanding of the situation and there can definitely be a lot more to this whole issue.</p>
<p>Whooping Cough ‚Äì As per what I can see, the big issue with the whooping cough situation (and with RT-PCR in general) is the lack of standardization. Here, you can see that there is a lot of variability in the experimental assay design (how the RNA or DNA is extracted, which primers are used for RT-PCR, which controls are used, how the analysis is done, what the cutoff limit it), and over 100 different designs have been noted (Source: Dragsted DM, Dohn B, Madsen J, Jensen JS. Comparison of culture and PCR for detection of Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis under routine laboratory conditions.  J Med Microbiol. 2004;53(Pt 8):749-75415272061). In addition,the variability in design can be seen in this clinical review (Mattoo S, Cherry JD. Molecular pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of respiratory infections due to Bordetella pertussis and other Bordetella subspecies.  Clin Microbiol Rev. 2005;18(2):326-38215831828)</p>
<p>A second point to consider is the improvement in technological design since 2006-2007. The rise of bioinformatics allows us to make a lot more predictive decisions based on the gene sequence of Sars-CoV-2 (which has been fully sequenced at this time), and the use of NCBI BLAST to determine gene specific primers that would not anneal to other genes. Furthermore, the rise in development of understanding of nucleic acid secondary structures allow us to design more structurally-specific primers as opposed to using traditional primer design criteria (G-C content of 50%, primer length, etc.) These can be seen in new computational programs like Primerize, Primer3Plus, etc.</p>
<p>Basically, the situation before would not be repeating now with Covid because (1) we have better designed tools (2) our experimental procedure is more streamlined.</p>
<p>With Covid, we can see that all US labs that perform covid testing are mandated to use the CDC-provided and standardized testing kit, which includes two sets of primers (2019-nCoV_N1 and 2019-nCoV_N2) as well as a RNAse P Primer probe (this is if TaqMan probes are used as opposed to the classical SYBR RT-PCR detection method). Not too sure how I can Eli5 this but just know that TaqMan probes are a LOT more directly specific for testing than SYBR, because SYBR will give data on any gene that has been amplified (which includes primer-dimer formation and is a part of the reason why RT-PCR data can sometimes be flawed), while TaqMan probes don‚Äôt do that and are very highly specific to the gene of interest.</p>
<p>In addition, all tests are done with positive control sample nCoVPC (which is a sample that is literally the covid gene, so you know what the data should look like if covid is present) and a negative control sample provided by the lab itself (which is a sample that does not have the covid DNA present, so you know what the data should look like if covid is NOT present), and a water control (where water is added instead of DNA so you can see just what the baseline detection limits are). All of this information (and the sequences) can be found in he CDC website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/virus-requests.html) and is fully detailed in an 80 page document for the use instructions.</p>
<p>A final note is that because RT-PCR is used instead of PCR, changes are seen in real-time (which is what RT stands for). In normal PCR, you often reach a maximum detection at around 30-35 cycles, so anything at 40 cycles is often too high for us to compare. But in RT PCR, you can see changes as each cycle occurs, and you are comparing the rate of change for each gene that you are testing. Hence, the main amplification changes that you see from cycles 15-30 are detected and comparisons can be made. In this way, RT-PCR has an added accuracy that normal PCR does not. </p>
<p>To conclude, I would argue that covid RT-PCR testing is highly accurate and can detect very small changes in gene expression. So to answer a detection question (is it there or not?), RT-PCR is a good model to use. Even if false positives occur, the general protocol is to screen another biological sample from the patient, so this helps to reduce error even more (If we assume that 1% of all PCR is false positive, then testing a second sample helps reduce the error, making two false positive in a row to be 1/100 * 1/100, as these are two independent events).</p>
<p>If you all have any other questions, I am happy to answer and help out.</p>

        <p>The issue with the PCR test isn't its capacity to detect something, but that what it does show us isn't proof that you have a specific virus in your body.</p>
<p>As it is argued in this study: "PCR and lateral flow tests do not distinguish live virus. No test of infection or infectiousness is currently available for routine use.678¬†As things stand, a person who tests positive with any kind of test may or may not have an active infection with live virus, and may or may not be infectious.9</p>
<p>The relations between viral load, viral shedding, infection, infectiousness, and duration of infectiousness are not well understood. In a recent systematic review, no study was able to culture live virus from symptomatic participants after the ninth day of illness, despite persistently high viral loads in quantitative PCR diagnostic tests. However, cycle threshold (Ct) values from PCR tests are not direct measures of viral load and are subject to error."
https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4851</p>
<p>And as I would argue myself, fragments of RNA can still be found in a person who's recovered from covid or another coronavirus, but that doesn't mean s/he is actually infected.</p>
<p>Generally, its presence isn't the same as being the host to an active virus.</p>

        <p>You raise a good point here - there definitely is an issue in detecting whether the virus present is alive or not as PCR does not provide that information. Now, there are a lot of assays which can do that, but they can't really be mass produced the way that PCR is mass-produced.</p>
<p>With regards to the study mentioned, while Ct values are not direct measurements, they can give you a lot of information especially relative to a housekeeping control gene. Increased concentrations of template do result in increased Ct values (This is seen in primer efficiency tests, which people should always perform when using primers for RT-PCR). So there definitely is a correlation and you can make qualitative claims based on your provided data. </p>
<p>The general reasoning atleast is that if you have levels that are detectable enough through PCR, then it is indeed possible that you have enough to atleast spread to other individuals. That itself makes the test a good indicator as to whether or not someone should be isolated from the general public so as to reduce transmission rates. In addition, viral fragments are quite quickly destroyed by the body, so viral RNA fragments rarely exist a long time in the cell. Half life of RNA is quite low, and this is the reason why mRNA vaccines need to be modified with unnatural bases like pseudouridine in order to increase its stability in-vivo.</p>

        <p>I'd be lying if I said I understand that stuff, but if YOU are right, then everything that happened last year simply didn't happen.  Your entire claim here is that damn near no one on the entire planet was sick last year.   The virus did not spread all around the planet in just 3 months, we didn't lose thousands of senior citizens in every state all in one month here in America, and every country in the world also had barely a few cases each.   I must have missed that because... I was told that it all happened....</p>
<p>Anyway, you're either right and everything on the news was faked or you're wrong and everyone on the planet who is testing positive now is only testing positive because the PCR test is picking up traces from long since recovered people.</p>
<p>So which is it?  </p>
<p>Let's look at what's actually goin on- spikes in cases- cases all around the world on the rise.  Climbing cases through the roof...</p>
<p>Damn near all of this are people getting tested because they either half to or they're afraid while they're showing absolutely no trace of any symptoms associated with a respiratory virus.  Hospitals are still demanding that PCR tests be done regardless of whether or not you have any symptoms.  In other countries, it's even worse.  Fear porn on the news are still drawing people in to testing centers.   And according to you- ALL PCR tests are popping out brand new fresh covid patients who JUST NOW AT THE TIME OF TESTING got covid for their very first time.</p>
<p>So what's the deal?   No one ever has once put out a model that explains how the virus could spread around the world and kill tens of thousands of people in each state and country within two to three months without infecting anyone in the process.</p>
<p>If I am right, the number of cases is pretty much the entire 7.9 billion people on the planet.   This means that PCR tests are bullshit, we've all had a go at the virus, and there are no more true cases.</p>
<p>If YOU are right, the virus either didn't go around the world at all, the media was lying, and every health person on the planet who tests positive just HAPPENED to have JUST THEN caught the virus for the first time in their lives.</p>
<p>Frankly, I need to see a contagion model that proves that you are right.  I want to see how the virus spread in the last year that ended up with only maybe 10% of the population being infected with another 90% left to go.</p>

        <p>Hello, I'm not too sure how my post claimed that people were not sick or that the viral transmission did not occur... All I'm saying here is that RT-PCR is a good way to test as to whether or not the virus is present. Are there better ways with more sensetivity (ie. plating cultures)? Yes. Are these possible to be mass-produced? No. With the current technology that we have, RT-PCR is the best technique that we can use and in general, it will be very effective to a high degree. Subsequent testing of positive individuals helps to reduce error rates and ensures that false positives are checked appropriately. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In addition, as per your request for modelling viral transmission (I am not a virologist or epidemiologist so this is not my area of expertise), there are a lot of papers published on this phenomenon. Now, it is difficult to model viral transmissions especially with something like Covid which is highly transmissive, but I can link a few sources for your reading here:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>1) <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309920301444">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309920301444</a></p>
<p>2) <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10311-020-01174-8">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10311-020-01174-8</a></p>
<p>3) <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/71/8/1943/5821281?login=true">https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/71/8/1943/5821281?login=true</a></p>
<p>There are a lot more on this topic, but these are some of the highly cited ones. I've only fully read the first two, and I have only read the abstract for the last one so unfortunately I can't really answer questions about them but you are welcome to do your own reading and research on this phenomenon!</p>
<p>Now with regards to transmission, the virus definitely has transmitted throughout the world. But, that doesn't mean it has infected everyone. And in infection, some individuals can fight it off without any symptoms, but may not develop antibodies in the process. Then, there are the mutations to consider as well, and whether or not naturally-developed antibodies will cover these (unlike the mRNA vaccines, which ARE effective against the delta/lambda variants). So, there's a lot to consider and to dig into. The data and information is definitely there for you to read through, on google scholar!</p>
