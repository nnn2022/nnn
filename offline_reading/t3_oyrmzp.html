        <p>I've seen more problems with pregnant women who've had the vaccine. But it's all anecdotal.</p>
<p>There's just not much data.</p>

        <p>I’m also curious. We were planning on trying for our second child in the next couple months but between the possibility of catching Covid, forced vaccinations, etc I can’t help feeling like it’s a really bad idea. It’s heartbreaking to me.</p>
<p>As of right now at my work we have the testing option but not sure how safe that is while pregnant either given they use EO to sterilize the swabs.</p>

        <p>do not use those tests! they reach the blood brain barrier. please look up some videos about what the swabs truly are! </p>
<p>there is a lot of data about women miscarrying before 30 weeks because after that it's considered a stillbirth so they've sharped their findings to make it look in their favour. i would like to have a second also. the only things i would be more alert too is keeping distance indoor/closeness of jabbed people and i will def try to have a home birth. no way i'm wearing a mask during or after birth and no way would my baby. just a some food for thought.</p>

        <p>Last February.</p>
<p>I was healthy. I was in a good BMI, generally healthy diet. Better than the average american, but I'm no vegan. </p>
<p>I had a student in my 4th grade class with an awful flu kinda thing that kept her out of school for a week, and then she was at school partially for another week, but she was miserable. Mom said doctor said it was a bad virus, didn't seem like the flu, though.. A few weeks later, I got super sick. At the time, I was 10-12 weeks pregnant. My fever spiked way up, and I felt like death. I had to take a fever reducer for a week religiously. Particularly, my lungs hurt. They were so fatigued. We went to the urgent care where the doctor said I didn't have the flu, but he didn't know what I had. They did a flu test anyways, told me to come back the next day, and told me to keep my fever down to protect the baby.</p>
<p>I cannot express how awful I felt.  The next day, I told the doctor that it was hard to breath and my lungs hurt. I wasn't any better, and they gave me anti-virals. They did not make me feel better. I was out of work for a week (I'm a teacher, and it sucks to have a sub. I would only take off IF I was seriously ill.) The 2nd week I was still super fatigued and coughed all the time. The third and fourth week, I had lost all my other symptoms EXCEPT the cough.  It did eventually fizzle out. Somewhere in there Covid became an actual thing, and I was absolutely convinced I had it. </p>
<p>Anyways, I'm fine. Baby is totally fine. I am 1000% sure I had Covid. Don't get me wrong, it SUCKED. I could barely manage the strength to carry my laundry from my upstairs to the basement. But I did recover. </p>
<p>I was in Michigan, so if I would've gotten Covid a few months later, I wonder if they would've admitted me since I was pregnant? My OBGYN and urgent care doctor did not seem to think my symptoms warranted a hospital visit at all at the time.</p>
