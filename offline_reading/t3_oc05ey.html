    <strong>I’ve been banned from a ton of different subreddits in the past 24 hours.</strong>
    <p><p>Just for participating in this one. I don’t really agree with about half of the posts here, but it’s one of the only communities online where I can discuss my distaste for the lockdowns imposed by governments. I don’t feel like this is a controversial take, but yesterday I was banned from a bunch of different subreddits for seemingly no reason aside from being subbed to this one. </p>
<p>The message I received said that nnn is a “disease vector” to other subreddits and society (I don’t know what this means) and that the only way they’ll lift the ban is if I promise to completely ignore nonewnormal.  </p>
<p>If people on the other side of some of these issues actually cared about people, as they say they do, and actually believe they are correct, as they claim they are, they’d engage with people like us instead of muting or banning.  This kind of stuff pushes me further into one side, rather than challenging any views I have.  Banning isn’t a solution to any perceived problem. </p>
<p>I’ve never posted any covid related stuff in any of the subs I was banned from, and actually haven’t really posted any comments in any of them for weeks so these bans came as a bit of a surprise. </p>
<p>I think these types of people that are banning users just for being associated with nonewnormal have a sickness. I think they’re lost and I’m not sure what the cure is.</p></p>
