        <p>I've shown 20 articles to a guy on Facebook about this.</p>
<p>He continues to double down saying, "no one ever said it <em>didn't</em> come from a lab."</p>
<p>FFS.</p>
<p>We're dealing with a cult.</p>

        <p>Kinda highlights the pointlessness of engaging in any sort of debate with some, doesn't it?</p>
<p>All too often it's the exact same disconnect mentality we deal with in this sub from "visitors".</p>

        <p>Around April 30, 2020, Trump said it was possible it escaped a lab.</p>
<p>Immediately, CNN posted an article that derided Trump as a moron and that he had departed from the "intelligence community", which was their go to statement anytime they could use it to present Trump as a fool (but I digress).  The intelligence community had already by this time - a whole 6 weeks in - "concluded" that the virus did not come from a lab.  </p>
<p>Lets look at how CNN wordsmiths take the narrative where they want it to go:</p>
<p>&rt; While the White House and State Department have urged intelligence officials to find evidence that backs up the theory that the outbreak can be traced back to a Chinese lab, </p>
<p>This is a setup they had already been using to tie Trump to evidence hunting that would be weaponized against him in November.  </p>
<p>&rt; the intelligence community made clear Thursday that they have not reached a definitive conclusion beyond ruling out theories that the virus was man-made or genetically modified.</p>
<p>They have no definitive conclusion except for the one that they have: Trump is wrong.</p>
<p>But also notice what they did not say.  The headline of this article is:</p>
<p>&rt; Trump contradicts US intel community by claiming he's seen evidence coronavirus originated in Chinese lab</p>
<p>But that's not what they "fact check".  Instead they say:</p>
<p>&rt; beyond ruling out theories that the virus was man-made or genetically modified.</p>
<p>Who knows why there is mistrust and division in the country?</p>
<p>Read through this article and see if CNN applies the same standard to Biden.</p>

        <p>This is a false flag if there ever was one. Create a furore around it leaking from a lab, admit negligence and set up a fall guy, all the while continuing under the pretence there is actually a new deadly virus and therefore keep people living in fear. If they still have the fear they still have control. </p>
<p>There is no new virus, this is all part of the plan.</p>
