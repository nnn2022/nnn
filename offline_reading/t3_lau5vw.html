<p>That happened more than once. Morphine was supposed to be less addictive than opium.  Heroin was initially marketed as less addictive than morphine.  Then dilaudid, oxycodone and fentanyl.  We really shouldn't trust a fucken thing that these companies say about painkillers.</p>

        <p>My ex's father had electro-shock. When I knew him in his eighties, only once he'd he talked about it, can't remember what prompted him, something on the tv, it was a long time ago. He said it was the most strange and terrifying thing he'd ever seen, or even heard of. Nevermind experienced. He said you instantly go into an outerbody experience, but you're behind eyes. Fully aware for the first few shocks. You've no concept of time and it feels like it goes on forever. He said it's not like it looks, that it's quick shock and then limp, repeat. He said the feeling from the first one remains, and builds. Bang, you're out of it, but stuck in it. A constant terrifying embrace of every muscle and nerve in your body, including your brain, that's not in your control. And each shock builds on the last. The feeling intensifying, along with the terror and inability to process anything. Like brainfreeze from ice cream but much stronger, and with a strange weight. Then after a few shocks a very drunk, like paralytic out of it, feeling builds up and it all goes black, but you still feel a few more shocks, the feeling is now so confusing and overpowering you can't even process it anymore, but it's like you feel the dark get darker. Then you black out. And when you wake up you're stuck with that feeling, except you can see and hear and are aware, but you still can't process, you feel completely out of your head drunk. Everything can start spinning around and then just stop all of a sudden. And you can be stuck like that for days/weeks. Lobotomies are just the next step in that way of thinking, leave em like that for life. It's fkn horrifying. IMHO the psychiatric sciences are a farce. Nothing more than a way to pacify people they can't otherwise control at worst.</p>

        <p>Well as an anarcho-primitivist, I strongly disagree. Technology may have increased our life span, but it has made our lives a lot less fulfilling. It doesn't allow us to achieve goals autonomously, its the source of all environmental problems, reduces our security and freedom, and has allowed populations to grow to an immense level. We have repressed all 'unclean' thoughts and urges and oversocialized generations, which is the cruelest form a torture imaginable.</p>

        <p>Well as a technologist, I strongly disagree. On the contrary, technology has enabled us to enjoy more our lives, automatizing most of simple redudant tasks. Primitivism, while being an idealistic thought, is not compatible with the society, which comes naturally with humans. And technology has enabled us to get the better out of this society for its citizen. It is not technology that is the source of environmental problems, or reducing security and freedom, but the fact that individualist tries to get higher than the society.</p>

        <p>I'm not so sure about quality of life improving for older people. Many people these days are chronically ill for the last 20-30 years of their lives with serious problems: heart disease, recurring bouts of cancer, dementia, diabetes, lung disease, etc. Many of our grandparents lived long lives in better health until the end, despite smoking, drinking, never working out, eating whatever they liked. Even millions of our young people have chronic illnesses, like obesity, ADHD, autism, that were rare 40-50 years ago.</p>

        <p>Boomers are dying the same way their parents were dying. The only difference is that the illnesses were not well detected back then, therefore the people could have died from multiple undetected illnesses. Same as ADHD and Autism, they were rare because they were not properly diagnosed, and those who were "unfit" for society were hidden in hospices, orphanage, mental wards, etc. But you are right on one point, we've seen increases in obesity in the lasts 20-30 years and that's something that surely ain't helping the general health.</p>

It's a matter of formerly rare illnesses becoming common and people getting sick not just in their last few years of life, but much earlier.</p>

        <p>I totally agree, topic is about science. Same as my comment. I don't why I would be trolling with that comment? Have I offended you because I said it's not because of religion?</p>
