    <strong>I went to a protest today (Canada)</strong>
    <p><p>I'll start this off by saying I've never actually gone to a protest for anything until today.</p>
<p>I'm in Edmonton, Alberta. I've seen the media coverage on past protests, and they're constantly screeching about rAcIsM and "science denial" at the protests, calling them "alt-right extremists", shit I really don't want to be associated with. I've been so disturbed lately thinking about the world we're creating for my future children, to the point I didn't care anymore, I have to do something. If I just stand by and let this continue I'll never be able to face myself in the mirror again. I heard there was an anti-lockdown protest every Saturday at 1pm at the legislature, so I went just to see what it was like, expecting to leave in disgust within 5 minutes.</p>
<p>HOLY FUCK WAS I WRONG. It was quite possibly the most reasonable organized protest I've ever seen. Reasonable speakers, reasonable signs, and overall just a group of 200 or so normal people who simply want to be allowed to live their lives, as they see fit, in peace. I listened to a few speakers, spoke briefly with a couple people, and went home. </p>
<p>Here's the best part - I saw people hugging, and smiling, and laughing, and cheering, and for a brief moment remembered what it's like to be human again. I always knew there were other dissenters out there, that I wasn't alone, but to actually see it first hand is a <em>massive</em> weight off my shoulders. I (a grown-ass man) damn near broke into tears when that hit me. I'm going to be riding this high all week, until I go back next Saturday. Had I known the protests were like this, I'd have been there from day 1.</p>
<p>To anyone like me who has misgivings about protesting, go check it out. The news is lying to you. You'll be pleasantly surprised, and it's 100% worth it. Time to get off your ass and stand up for what you believe in.</p></p>

        <p>I went last week and it's still a little disappointing that there weren't more people.  I was hoping to get contact info for the organizers.  I called the hotline on the endthelockdown website but the person I spoke with was from Calgary and he didn't have any info for Edmonton.</p>

        <p>With Canadians being as generally obedient as we are, I'm amazed at the numbers as is. Doesn't help that it's difficult to find any information about the protests at all, I just happened to hear it mentioned in a random YouTube video.</p>
<p>Definitely going to start inviting and bringing likeminded friends. Something like this needs word of mouth.</p>

        <p>Canadian protests are a strange animal. There could be a couple hundred people or countless thousands, it's tough to predict. Last Saturday's Toronto protest had about 12,000 people and the responses from passersby was hugely supportive (honking, thumbs up, chanting) but in the winter some weeks it was literally a few dozen and half the people there were just plain old cop baiters looking for a scrap, just the worst fucking optics, for all I know they were provacateurs acting out for the Global News crew.</p>

        <p>Good for you for going. I am not brave enough yet, in my city it's so small and I'm still scared of losing any semblance of community I have left. This is why more people aren't speaking out/acting out - belonging/not being shunned is too important to people. But at some point I will be ready!</p>

        <p>It's not an easy decision. I'm nervous about being shamed. There are videos going around on local social media in order to shame "anti-maskers" that were at the protest. Cancel culture is huge here and everyone knows each other or is only a few degrees apart. I've been lonely already for the past year and everyone I know is leftist/queer and pro-lockdown. That being said I know refusing to stay silent will help other people see that it's okay.. if it was a bigger city/protest I'd have no issues</p>

        <p>I know how it is. I live in a tiny community as well and it’s not always easy to be “that person.” Virtually everyone here is a provax maskie. It’s nuts. I’ve been ostracized and shamed for my outspokenness and I’ve learned to give less and less of a shit each day. Happily, there’s a small (woke) group of us who get together every couple of months or so and we chat about how to tackle this covid1984 insanity from different angles. I have four kids and they are my driving incentive to keep fighting! </p>

        <p>Glad you went, even though I don’t live in Canada. I’m not sure why being anti-mask, questioning the policy decisions of the government with regards to lockdowns or mask mandates is getting tied to racism or the alt right.</p>

        <p>Pro tip for being human and compassionate during this time: host freedom potlucks. My family has been hosting them for 3 months now. Every Sunday we invite a couple people over for dinner, no masks, no social distancing, real unfiltered discussion. Our biggest potluck had 14 people in total.</p>

        <p>I noticed a couple angry-looking masked people riding by on bikes and taking pictures at one point, I wouldn't be surprised if that were a thing.</p>
<p>That said, these kinds of people are  usually the types who are scared to do basic things like leave the house or go to the grocery store. What are they going to do, show up at my front door? Good luck with that. Tell my friends and coworkers about my views? Go for it, they all know.</p>

        <p>I did bring a gaiter just in case shit went south, but I figured wearing it defeats the purpose of the protest.</p>
<p>I think not hiding who you are adds value to the protest, showing that you're not going to be intimidated into hiding your views. I follow their rules when required at work, what I do on my own time is my business and I doubt my employer would see it any differently.</p>

        <p>Canada has definetly ramped up bashing and treating these protestors like they are worse than the virus itself. Its embarassing to see the media spreading so much hate when really all these protestors want is to be left alone to live their lives normally. I can relate, all I want to do is live my life as normal but there are way too many doomers out there that want me to just stay locked up in my home, lose my job and end up in debt all for a virus that has a 98% recovery rate. Absolutely ridiculous way of thinking. As we enter the summer months and as this drags on I really hope the protests increase in size because something has to change soon or we are all screwed here in Canada.</p>

        <p>The first thing that comes to mind is to find some local media hit piece about a protest in the past, take note of the place/day of the week/time and show up there accordingly (if the last one was a Saturday at 1pm, show up there on a Saturday at 1). Decent odds you find a protest.</p>

        <p>Toronto, 12 noon Saturdays at Queen's Park by the statue of King George VI. The British man one on the horse with the big weiner.</p>
<p>Crowd hangs around for a while, then does a march throughout downtown. Doesn't really follow a set route and the size and composition of the crowd varies but it's been there every week in some capacity. Yonge St between Queen and Bloor, Bloor St between Yonge and Avenue Rd, Dundas Square, and Nathan Phillips Square are all usual features from the rallies I've been to. It's all quite free form and organic, by design there is no one person or organization in charge, you got a megaphone or whatever no-one's going to accost you and be all like "umm we need our messaging to stay on point, speak with the organizers for our list of grievances", so long as you're not making any threats you can speak your piece.</p>
<p>If you are on a bike and familiar with downtown geography you will inevitably find the march doing its rounds just by riding up and down the streets. Downtown is a fairly small place when you think about it.</p>
<p>Occasionally you will find marches and pickets outside the major downtown arteries and squares. A couple weeks ago I found some based boys and girls on Roncesvalles of all places.</p>
<p>By 4:00 they're usually back at the well hung horse statue in Queen's Park.</p>
<p>Some weeks they've started at Dundas Square or Nathan Phillips as well.</p>
<p>Rebel News has covered many of these protests and they're active on Instagram. "The Line" doesn't like them or "Hugs Over Masks" and I'm not really sure why. They do motorcade protests in the suburbs on Sundays.</p>
