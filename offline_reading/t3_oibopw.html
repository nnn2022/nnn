    <strong>Don’t go let this consume you.</strong>
    <p><p>A word of advice from someone avid on conspiracies and awake to a lot of the bullshit in the world.</p>
<p>Don’t let anger overwhelm you. I know that if you can see the corruption and the lies you realize that it’s a really big deal and it feels like nobody else understands what you are saying or they’ll tell you that you’re wrong. You try to wake people up because you care about them and it hurts you to see them turn on you. </p>
<p>This will make some people angry or feel scared by the state of the world but you can’t let this destroy you. Some people just aren’t willing to entertain your ideas.  </p>
<p>I spent countless hours arguing about my opinion with my family and trying to wake up the rest of the world but in the end it makes no difference and will only isolate you. </p>
<p>Really there’s nothing that you on your own can do about the big picture because the people in control have set it up that way. Yes that’s a negative attitude but it’s words of wisdom. </p>
<p>I’m not telling you to forget about any of this, it always helps to be informed, talk it over with likeminded people, go to protests, find people on subs like this one, stand up for your beliefs but don’t try to force them on other people. That’s what they try to do to you but you don’t want to be like them. </p>
<p>Elect government that puts values on personal choice and freedoms is about the best thing you could do. Maybe when more people wake up there will be a true revolution but I wouldn’t count on that. </p>
<p>Feel free to not get your shot and tell everyone that you did, go to large gatherings during lockdowns and keep it quiet and off of social media. You don’t need to advocate your defiance to the world. </p>
<p>I don’t care if you agree with this but it was something I really needed to hear.
Stay strong everybody.</p></p>

        <p>I think as someone who has just woke up to the corruption a few months ago it’s a good message to hear but also the amount of digging it took to come to all these realizations will make someone like me pretty livid. I have realized that most people will just not change their mind and that I have a social responsibility to get vaccinated. What do I tell people with this attitude? one includes my father who I’ve had multiple discussions with and then he pulls out the following arguments. Well the vaccine eradicated polio and measles, you have a social responsibility, unvaxxed are the cause of variants. It gets really overwhelming when you need to fight back against multiple people at once that share these ideas.</p>

        <p>Social responsibility is a construct. You could feel it’s your social responsibility to warn these people of the potential risks of vaccinations without thorough testing as a point. There is a lot of evidence to show that what we are doing is unethical, dangerous and coerced but it depends on what he is willing to hear.</p>

        <p>I’m not opposed to that I said you should stand up for your beliefs. I’m just saying that if your not being forced then don’t try to convince others you are right. If it becomes mandatory or you are stuck with any authority figure who is demanding it you should certainly fight back. You could just tell him that you are vaccinated and pretend that’s the case depending on the if you have a passport system and if he’d want evidence. They made me livid too and I still am to a degree I just don’t let family/friends/coworkers/social media hear about it unless they feel the same. (besides a few places on reddit).</p>

        <p>There was always going to be variants. There was never going to be a world where we got the vaccinations so high that it would stop a variant from evolving. Maybe if we all starting taking Ivermectin...but I digress because that was never going to happen either, even if everyone was on board and the WHO and Fauci did not sabotage it.</p>

        <p>You are correct. However, it takes a while to figure this out. I was angry for a lot of years. I vote and do things that align with my beliefs. However, I’ve never herd two people with opposing views have a conversation when one of them suddenly stops and says “you’re right, I’m going to adopt the opposite opinion” That’s just not the way the human brain works. </p>
<p>Think about the cancel culture and how it makes you feel. When we try to change people’s minds that’s what it makes them feel like. </p>
<p>For as long as the media and government manipulates the message that is how long this will last. If you think it’s going to change in your lifetime remember this: Benjamin Franklin was a media mogul and George Washington was the richest man in the country.</p>

<p>I will never give up on red-pilling my sister on this. I've found the common ground we have: believing in the power of natural immunity and our bodies' ability to heal itself.

        <p>You need to understand how scared and brainwashed people are. Yes maybe that makes them shitty people but you can put yourself in their shoes and see their point too. They as fully vaccinated people don’t want to hear the dangers of the vaccine. Maybe your job requires it and you have no choice but to tell them that you have it. Where I’m from anti vax opinions can get you into bad situations so if somebody is pressuring you to get it just tell them what they want to hear. It’s advice it’s not something you have to listen to and I used to think the exact same way and would defend my opinion tooth and nail. It was not worth it</p>

        <p>Some criticism I've heard about Libertarianism is that while it is admirable in theory, it doesn't work so much in practice.</p>
<p>That would be because since libertarians don't want to control anything, their political opponents have ample room to do them in.</p>
<p>And being too permissive isn't always good, as it is the case with drugs.</p>
<p>I don't know enough to say to what extent this is true, but it may be worth thinking about.</p>

        <p>OR, maybe instead of being bitter, be brave.  I have to disagree about going with the flow.  I really recommend listening to this interview from a lady who escaped N Korea- she says she realized that the only way the regime could continue to exist was because people kept silent.  I'm not willing to be the person who keeps silent, I can't live with myself knowing I would contribute (by my silence) to oppression and even in some cases death. My personal opinion is that I'd rather be part of the solution than part of the problem.    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yqa-SdJtT4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yqa-SdJtT4</a></p>

        <p>I agree that there is sometimes a high price to pay for speaking up, but I would argue that there is a higher price to be paid for keeping silent.  Historically speaking the greatest atrocities of the world would never have happened if people spoke up.  I'm not willing to be the German who was silent as the Jews were murdered.  I'd rather go down doing the right thing.  But it's a personal choice.  If I have to die for standing up for the truth, so be it.  I'd be really interested to hear what you think after listening to the Parks interview I posted above.  I agree with you also on the point to not let it take over- either the anger or the whole situation.  I give myself mental breaks to stay healthy where I don't read or talk about it for a certain amount of time every week.  Trying to do the right thing takes some serious stamina.</p>

        <p>Elect government = illusion of freedom. Thanks for your kind words. Mine: the only thing you can elect is a monetary system in which money is not created out of thin air and used to pull the strings in the world. Peacefully abandon the system that was used to cause this for cryptocurrencies.</p>

        <p>I very much agree that we need a cryptocurrency based system. Really all government transactions should be done in crypto because we could then hold them accountable for all of their spending in real time</p>

        <p>I agree and disagree.  I think if you do argue the cause of truth in any way that is a good thing; and knowing the truth; we are obligated to fight for it and to share it; or else we are complicit with the evil and acting cowardly.  </p>
<p>However, there is an important point here you’ve made I think that I would phrase as: pick your battles wisely.  You don’t need to go parading into the street and telling it to everyone you know.  If someone asks if you got the vaccine, I would at bare minimum tell the truth (“no I haven’t.”). And if they ask why I can give them a softball and say “I’m not in an at risk category and I’m concerned about long term side effects.”  I don’t need to talk about conspiracy with big pharma or anything.  Just minor little red pills.  </p>
<p>And it’s not like I go out of my way to convince people.  But I certainly am not going to be part of the dystopia or part of the problem.  We can not be contributors to this nightmare. </p>
<p>We just have to be pragmatic about it and yes; not try to bear the entire weight of the whole thing on our shoulders as one person or else we will get bitter and exhausted.  People can make their own choices and ultimately they should be educating and researching themselves.  But I can still do my own part that’s reasonable for me.</p>

        <p>I feel you. I’ve been isolated for years because of all the sickness in the world that nobody sees. The hard truth is that it is too late to wake the masses up. 2 years ago? Maybe. But now? No. Either you understand or you don’t. Agenda 21 is here and paving the way for Agenda 2030</p>
