    <strong>I have a somewhat crazy conspiracy theory pertaining to us not getting the vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>A lot of you probably aren't going to like what I say, but I feel it's definitely something to think about. Let me be clear when I say fuck these vaccines! What's going on is absolutely insane and it's so obvious, hear me out though..</p>
<p>I feel like this is biological warfare on a mass scale, and we're in the test phases. This is all to see what can and can't be gotten away with when it comes to our governments and what they're doing. This is just a trial run per say. Let me get into it.</p>
<p>What if this vaccine isn't for covid but something much more deadly? What if the non compliant are the targets of an actually deadly disease or virus that hasn't been released yet? Think about it. The non compliant are a minimal part of the population. Very few people know how to use their brains and think past a tv screen like us. Killing us off wouldn't really matter to the masses and it would help the "NWO" push their agenda much much easier knowing the world has been ridded of people that can think. Also there would be alot of "I told you sos" that have been trained to hate people like us. Many brainwashed people would like to see people like us dead as fucked up as it is, making it all the more "righteous" in the eyes of the besieged.</p>
<p>This may be crazy to some or alot but it's definitely something in the realms of possibilities...</p></p>

        <p>You can safely induce psychological death any time with certain medicines. Whether it be taking very large amounts of psilocybin or a through a deep meditative state. </p>
<p>If you want to get there with only meditation , you’ll need a lot of practice. </p>

        <p>My entire purpose is to serve God. That’s different for everyone. I lost the appetite for consuming material things. I’ve adopted a more conscious lifestyle. I moved to my cottage. I don’t eat meat. I’m working toward minimalism. Basically to just be living with the planet and nature rather than against it. I’ve left behind societal nonsense such as BLM or other ideological nonsense. But my love and respect for persons of colours has grown. I’m just not a hypocrite to prop up black lives while ignoring indigenous lives. </p>
<p>I’m still not “on the other side of the river.” I still have small attachments. I’ll have a beer almost daily. Smoke weed. I have a gf but I like checking out other girls. I’m not perfect. I’m human. I accept my short comings. But I do my best not to harm people. </p>
<p>I have zero motivation to live up to society standards. I’m a yoga teacher. I still invest here and there. I’m turning my property into a spiritual, Mindfulness, medicine retreat so that others can find their true nature. </p>
<p>I don’t care what people believe in, only that they find the truth within them. And so my purpose is to facilitate that growth in anybody who wants it.</p>

        <p>Lovely. I made a decision I wanted to serve God many years ago and I have slowly made changes but I still also have a lot of fears and attachments. I am trying to make that move more towards living in peace and love, which I find really hard when I see all the injustice in the world. But I can feel that I seem more powerful when I'm in that state. But I'm still really struggling with what it is exactly I ought to be doing with my particular skillset...</p>

        <p>You’re on the path and the great news is you can’t get off :) </p>
<p>Try not to put too much pressure on yourself to be something you aren’t. The more you hold in or deny those attachments the more they’ll manifest in unhealthy ways. </p>
<p>Do you work with any medicines to remove that trauma in you? I really do recommend psychedelics to process those energy blockages in us.</p>

        <p>I've had the same phenomenon happen to me after a bad seizure. Life flashed before my eyes except it was way more intense than a conscious life flashing. It was completely overwhelming and longer than your typical blink of an eye life flash. After this and still being unconscious I saw light and it was the most comfortable warm feeling I've ever experienced. I was completely drawn to it after being so overwhelmed as if I went through an absolutely terrible trip on a hallucinogen. Shortly after "walking" or floating towards the light I realized what it was and thought to myself I'm not ready for this. I was only 17 at the time.</p>

        <p>I should rephrase. The instinctual fear of death will never go away as death approaches. Especially if you consciously sign up for inducing it. But the ability to surrender to it begins to grow. So that as youre faced with the reality of demise, you simply let go. And slip away. Fighting it is extremely difficult.</p>

        <p>I like the way you think....</p>
<p>....but now I'm thinking you might just be a misinformation agent trying to get us all vaccinated. </p>
<p>Truth is, it's a gamble either way. </p>
<p>We either dont get vaccinated and they release a more deadly virus that wipes out all unvaccinated. </p>
<p>Or...</p>
<p>..we ALL are forced to vaccinate and are left sterile or slowly killed over the coming years</p>
<ul>
<li>I tend to lean towards the former; I believe people down the road will begin to experience infertility and it will be said that it was an unforeseen side effect or some bullshit like that</li>

        <p>Definitely not the opposition. I advise all people in my life to not get vaccinated for various reasons. Too much risk to shew away a "deadly" virus that isn't very efficient at killing.</p>

        <p>At the moment I consider this theory as unlikely. But I'll keep it in mind and look for clues that could confirm it.</p>
<p>I think it has some merit and should not easily be dismissed.</p>
<p>The main reason because of why I consider it unlikely is that it depends on premises, that I also consider to be unlikely.</p>

<p>Don't think this way.</p>
<p>When I was young, I assumed that due to my fascination with guns, dope, motorcycles and redheads, I would die young.  Believing this led me to ignore things like financial planning, career strategy, regular medical checkups and other things adults do.  Now, I'm 50 and wishing I had paid more attention to this kind of stuff.</p>

        <p>Maybe, but I doubt it. For that to work, they'd have to create a new virus. Then they'd have to create a vaccine that's effective against that virus and partly effective against COVID. That would be easy enough by making the viruses similar to each other, except that then unvaccinated people who catch and recover from COVID would be at least somewhat resistant to the new super-virus too. </p>
<p>It's more likely that it's normal corruption and power-grabbing. Intended to make a whole lot of money for Big Pharma, erode bodily autonomy rights, and pave the way for more semi-mandatory treatments, vaccines, and surveillance later.</p>

        <p>my husband said the SAME thing. thinning of the population. if you were govt -who would you want sticking around? the compliant ones that you can control or the ones that won’t take the vaccine?
what if they are releasing the ‘variant’ that unvaccinated people will definitely die from?</p>

        <p>If they wanted a mass killing, they would want anyone who can possibly die, to die. They wouldn’t bother with a mass protection program. They’d want everyone dead, even the sheep. And they basically do.</p>

        <p>I don't believe that. The compliant make there lives easier, not harder. They'd start with non compliants first then make there slow or fast move onto the compliant. The compliant will help keep the world spinning as they have mediocre careers.</p>
