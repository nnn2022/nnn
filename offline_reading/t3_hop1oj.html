        <p>I've said before, and I'll say again, most of the pro-lockdowners are a variation, or combination, of the following:</p>
<p>-White</p>
<p>-At least somewhat wealthy</p>
<p>-Have a nice home</p>
<p>-Happy being single or already have a family/partner</p>

        <p>Not everyone that should get unemployment is getting it sadly. Which is really bs considering that supposedly some are getting more on unemployment than working full time, im not sure how true that is but if so, then it stands to reason that of course they would be pro lockdown in that instance. They can sit, live off the government and do basically nothing. Some of these people dont seem to understand that alot of people like to actually earn their living instead of waiting on Government handouts.</p>

        <p>What I don't understand is how many people are content to just sit at home and do nothing. I received the expanded unemployment for almost two months, and while I'm grateful it kept me fed, housed, and let me pay for some creative hobby stuff, I'm grateful to be working again... for significantly less money.

<p>Having no routine or reason to wake up in the morning caused a messed up sleep cycle, which turned into a dependence on sleeping pills. My drinking problems got worse, because what did it matter if I spent half my days hungover? I had nowhere to be. </p>
<p>I'm still struggling with depression due to missing people I can't be with, but at least at work there's something to <em>do</em> and some fleeting social contact.</p>
<p>Maybe I just haven't found the right Netflix show or video game. That's what gives life purpose, right?</p>

        <p>How dare that I haven't found someone to marry yet (at least now I know who to weed out). How dare was I planning to change careers before they stupidly activated this bizarre self-destruct sequence? How dare was I planning on traveling? On buying a house? On having a kid some day (which now I won't because even when things do go back to normal, they've set a dangerous precedent and I will never feel comfortable bringing a new life into this world). How dare I just want to do the little things that are normal in a free society, like going to public places and public events without feeling like I'm in a dystopian nightmare and being harassed by the Covidian cultists? How selfish that Im human and want to live my life in a country that's supposed to be the land of the free?</p>

        <p>I have a lot of the same concerns and was in a very similar place to you prior to the lockdown hitting in March. It was pretty depressing for a few months. I had no motivation to wake up to work and everyone around me kept telling me to be thankful that I don't have to worry about a commute and that I still had a job. </p>
<p>I also feel unsure about children/the future.  I won't turn down the opportunity if it happens for me, because I figure that at least I'll leave behind someone who will fight the good fight (I hope.)</p>

        <p>Can relate to the sleep cycle issues! Been waking up later and sleeping in later everyday for the past few months; stayed up til 4am browsing Reddit and eating a whole carton of ice cream last month, then my husband and I slept in til his mother woke us up at 9am. Mind you, my mom used to scream at me and sometimes beat me for sleeping in past 6am or waking up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, so I have a bit of a complex regarding sleep habits. And bathroom habits, for that matter.</p>
<p>Netflix and video games can totally help ease some pressure though, in moderation. Big key word right there. Wake up with the sun, exercise regularly, garden, sew, cook, clean, paint, maybe watch Punisher or play Fallout, and go to bed before midnight. I don't watch TV or play video games very often, but when I do, I binge, and it only feels good for so long. Same with healthier habits like exercise, you need to take a break every so often to allow mind and body to recover.</p>

        <p>Interesting to consider the race aspect. A lot of the harshest, judgiest and most fearful people in all of this corona-mess have been poc in my area/circle of people. It really threw me off. I thought poc were more skeptical of their governments (maybe that's an internal bias I have.)</p>
<p>All the Caucasian people I know are not freaking out about coming close to talk to someone or quitting their social lives for covid. Maybe it varies by geography, but the lockdown never happened for those people as far as I can tell. </p>
<p>The rest makes sense. Everyone who has a free pass to WFH indefinitely and spends their Saturday nights watching Netflix is ok with this extended social isolation. I wonder what percentage of the developed world that is at this point.</p>

        <p>I'll just say, I've been through this, with the COVID goings-ons, and even before this on other topics. I think there is a lot of overlap between these bullies, for me, at least. I'm sorry you got harassed, I know it stings even when we think about how stupid and petty they are being. Just know that you are not alone here, and you acted much more maturely than they did.</p>

<p>&rt;I know it stings even when we think about how stupid and petty they are being.</p>
<p>...is helpful. Totally different subject, but I dealt with similar when I expressed frustration (in a group that revolves around the job, so it's appropriate; also on FB) about co-workers making unwanted advances toward me and not knowing how to deal with it. It turned into attacks on my appearance and that I should be grateful to have that problem. I know they're just trolls, but holy hell, people can be really vicious for no reason.</p>
<p>(Thankfully, the workplace does not find it funny. The managers and HR ended up finding out about this. Turns out it's not something they play around with because they've seen too many occasions where the matter gets worse.)</p>

        <p>Not a shock. I once complained (in a group that was for my job) about trouble with unwanted sexual/romantic advances. Cue the attacks on my appearance. That and "you can't get laid" are popular insults, I guess because they're sensitive matters, and thus, easy targets.</p>

        <p>Not really.  No one I know with any motivation or prospect is loving this lockdown.  Most of the proponents of it are.  That’s why there is no criteria for when it will end.  They want locked down forever.</p>

        <p>Right! Even when I accept and admit my selfishness, they shriek "You're selfish!" like I didn't just say it myself. I also got told to "move away from society" or some shit but that I probably wouldn't because society benefits me. Actually, I'm planning to move off-grid as soon as humanly possible. Lockdown isn't helping though.</p>

        <p>These mask lockdown idiots need to move.  Move away from society if you’re that fucking scared.  They aren’t though.  They just want to sit home and live on tax money.  That’s 100% what this is about to lockdown proponents.</p>
