    <strong>This subreddit is fucking delirious</strong>
    <p><p>Why do you not wear masks? You say you cant breathe in them yet people who have actual problems get shitted on by people who say they have a medical condition. Do you realize how selfish it is to literally fake a medical condition to not wear something that will take two seconds, most places have them for free. The logic in this subreddit is what got r/NoMask banned.</p></p>

        <p>I‚Äôm not anti-mask. In my province, we are forced to wear masks, i don‚Äôt give a fuck. Its not uncomfortable. I have a problem with:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shutting down economy‚Äôs</li>
<li>The government making decrees that prohibit social gatherings, sitting down in restaurants, using gyms, organized sports</li>
<li>Police in my area being able to fine anyone who does not follow the ‚Äúrules‚Äù</li>
</ol>
<p>Listen its 8 fucking months, we all know what the risks are of Covid, let people decide what risks we wanna take, or not take. I see small businesses going under everywhere. also Canadian governmental debt is at a critically terrible level, we are basically going to become a welfare state</p>

        <p>Why would you wear them, if they don't really work?</p>
<p>The government are the real antimaskers, most of the 'masks do not work' statements were issued by them. Including now, they are saying that masks do not work in restaurants and gyms, therefore they must stay closed. That's antimasking rhetoric, that is coming directly from the government.</p>
<p>Very soon the government will go full on antivaxx, they'll be saying 'vaccines do not work, they just give you side effects, so take the vaccine but keep staying home'</p>

        <p>The fact that you have to ban us just proves that you want to suppress the truth. Why do you not just mind your own business and let people decide if they want to wear a useless mask or not. You need to wake the fuck up you brainless sheep!</p>

        <p>I wear a mask. I'm not here for the anti-mask sentiment at all. I was just looking for a sub for people who are skeptical of the way governments are handling the pandemic.</p>
<p>This sub doesn't really fit what I am looking for (too many whacky conspiracy theories) but it's all I have found so far. Like anything, there are delirious nutjobs on both sides of the issue. Sadly they are always the ones who take over the conversation, and now it is impossible to have a balanced or reasonable discussion.</p>

        <p>As a person who is against lockdowns and forced vaccination, but not necessarily anti-mask, I think every sub that wants to have discussions about Covid is going to have extremists and crazies that obviously attract the most attention. </p>
<p>Like I‚Äôm willing to bet money that not everyone who wants to take severe measures against Covid is a doomsayer like what gets the most attention in the main Coronavirus sub. Most of you have just made decisions based on your own feelings, experiences and research, just like most people here on ‚Äúthe other side‚Äù have. </p>
<p>I will happily and usually wear a disposable mask at Walmart and places like that- I‚Äôm not looking to start a fight or be hostile to people who are just trying to do their jobs. Joe Average the Walmart Greeter didnt personally write the mask mandate into law and I find the public freak out people embarrassing as well. I take it off when I‚Äôm out of there and when I start eating, it‚Äôs nbd to me. </p>
<p>However- there‚Äôs not a lot of places that make it illegal to NOT wear a mask- if you really don‚Äôt want to wear one, you can refuse to by simply saying no thank you, and continue. I do this at my gym- I‚Äôve NEVER ‚Äúfaked‚Äù or even claimed to have a medical condition, or said ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt breathe in this‚Äù, I‚Äôve just calmly told the person at the door no thank you when I‚Äôm offered a mask, refused any additional comments. I‚Äôve also made sure that I‚Äôm being good with cleaning off equipment and free weights when I‚Äôm finished, and stay within my booking time and keep distance when necessary. Not wanting to be masked all the time doesn‚Äôt mean that I literally hate all other people or would ever go out of my way to make others uncomfortable. It just means that I‚Äôm making choices for myself that SOME PEOPLE choose to think is all about them- but MOST people absolutely don‚Äôt. The internet makes it look like people see one unmasked person and lose their shit- that‚Äôs not the case at all. </p>
<p>I have friends who take it all very seriously, and I respect their CHOICE to stay at home, wear masks, sanitize, whatever else they want to do. It doesn‚Äôt make them lesser people and I don‚Äôt think they should be cut off from society for that choice either. The ones I‚Äôm close to definitely know that I usually don‚Äôt wear a mask and have been out socially and seen my family- and they‚Äôre okay with it because they‚Äôre confident in their own precautions- which is what most NORMAL people are like. We‚Äôre all just dealing with the world being like this in the best way for ourselves and respecting each other. What‚Äôs truly selfish is the constant ‚Äúhope you die‚Äù kind of rhetoric that crops up in response to any opinion of Covid on the internet that strays from the main narrative. </p>
<p>To that note- if you work at a store or some public place and feel truly uncomfortable about having an unmasked person in there- rather than your own public freak out, simply text or use your walkie to inform management. If the person is truly malicious, like they want to cough on everything and just act like shitheads, management can deal with it, or security can deal with it. I‚Äôve worked retail for years- we are always told never to confront a shoplifter but somehow people think the moral righteous points they get for confronting an ‚Äúanti-masker‚Äù are worth the trouble? Lol, either keep your own distance and recognize you are not the law- or inform your management or security team and let them make the decision. Whatever your beliefs are, it‚Äôs not your job!</p>

        <p>I'm not anti-mask, I just don't support a mandatory mask policy. By law I've medical exempt and an official diagnosis, but to avoid the hassle with legal paperwork and all that I've not applied yet. Therefor I've used my mask and followed the law.</p>
<p>I'm against a mask mandate because of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Voluntarism. I believe something being voluntarily is better for the public's mental health. If they choose to do something instead of being forced to it, it would be less stress on them.</li>
<li>Ineffective. Even if masks worked, they're ineffective. Most people use them wrong and have no medical training like professionals does. Reusing old masks, not washing them or their hands frequently enough, touching their face etc.</li>
<li>Harder for medical exempts always having to prove themselves. Getting questioned by police and all the hassle with paperwork are stressful. PTSD, claustrophobia, anxiety, autism, auditory sensory issues, deafness, mobility issues etc. are real.</li>
<li>Not good for the general public's mental health to treat others as potential threat and live in fear. It's a virus with high survival rate and not too different from the flu. It's not Ebola. So, disadvantages outweigh benefits.</li>
</ul>
<p>If people choose to wear mask, it's a choice and fine. It's not fine to fine people for not wearing one.</p>
