        <p>It's not humor... it is what is actually going on with this overblown Scamdemic driven by inaccurate PCR tests.</p>
<p>Yes, the PCR tests are inaccurate according to WHO themselves. Being run at too many cycles, not meant to be used for diagnosis purposes because they cannot differentiate between live and dead viral material... need I keep on going?</p>

        <p>This source basically says that if you don't know how to do PCR tests you shouldn't do them... well, duh.</p>
<p>Yes, there are many that seek to make money off of people while using their panic as a cover. That's why the free market has very little to do with medicine. Always when you go test yourself use a reputable laboratory. Most of the small private laboratories are very short on staff and it is very probable that at some time they might not have the qualified personal needed to operate.</p>
<p>The more government regulation there is the less there are such problems. If the government is silent on the issue and provides no guidelines you can expect such problems.</p>
<p>I expect most laboratories of big hospitals to have very high standard for testing, as it is usually the same personal and machinery used for in and out of hospital clients, and physicians require the best possible to be able to do their job as effectively as possible.</p>
<p>Also this article insinuates that the COVID pandemic is not that bad while in reality excess mortality soars around the world...</p>

        <p>First, as I said in another post: making a test is a balance between sensitivity and specifity, and you cannot have both.</p>
<p>Second, even your article disagrees with you: 
&rt;But researchers say the solution is not to test less, or to skip testing people without symptoms, as recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/27/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-testing.html">suggested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.
Instead, new data underscore <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/06/health/rapid-Covid-tests.html">the need for more widespread use of rapid tests</a>, even if they are less sensitive.</p>
<p>They say the opposite. We should test more... And we can even use the cheaper alternative. Many counties have already moved on this informations and now accept both rapid and PCR test for COVID as a proof that someone does indeed have it.</p>

        <p>The article advocates for more testing, yes. But look deeper into it and you’ll see the real problem. </p>
<p>&rt;    In Massachusetts, from 85 to 90 percent of people who tested positive in July with a cycle threshold of 40 would have been deemed negative if the threshold were 30 cycles, Dr. Mina said. “I would say that none of those people should be contact-traced, not one,” he said.</p>
<p>85-90% of positives were effectively meaningless at the current threshold of testing.</p>

        <p>So now if you show me where did you get the information that 85-90% of the positives are false? Because this is the cruch right?
People like you make our work so much harder... So in the medical community as in most scientist comunities we strive to do better. We work in an imperfect world with imperfect people, and there is always room for improvement. The fact that you are using a journalists report of an article that helps us do our work better from now on to discredit or misimform people about the seriousness of the pandemic is honestly sickaning.</p>
<p>So, is it possible that because of the shortages of personal some smaller laboratories have inadequate results - definatly. But is this a proof that this whole thing is a conspiracy - no. There will always be people trying to profit from the misfortune of others. Like the owners of said laboratories that force unqualified personal to work with a test they have not and don't have the qualification to work with. But even if all of this is true there is no way that this means that 85-90% of the PCR tests are false positives.</p>
<p>From a <a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.32.2001483?crawler=true">study</a> I have found it seems that if you have a &rt;35 cycles it is far more likely to have a negative result of the test - <a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/docserver/ahah/fulltext/eurosurveillance/25/32/2001483-f2_thmb.gif">graph</a>. This is probably because vast majority of the COVID possitive people are detected with way less cycles. So it is definatly true that the more cycles you do the more the test is likely to be false possitive, but what you actually do is increase sensitivity and decrease specifity by a few percentages. We should definatly strive to be better and retesting symptomatic people with high CT is warrented. I don't see where the problem is?</p>
<p>What I am trying to say is this cycle talk is a warning first to phisicians to take into account clinical presentation (which we already do) and second to laboratory workers to not release &rt;35-40 as possitive which as suppose they do because I have had a lot of tests where they say "result unclear please re-do the test" (I can't know for sure as I don't oversee any laboratory staff...).</p>

<p>Many things are possible, but not exactly probable. But you completely ignored the study I showed you where only around 9% of the tested with over 35 cycles PCR's come out positive. Also the mean of cycles used for a test was around 25-30. Granted this is in UK and maybe the laboratory staff in the US is dumb as rocks and cannot preform this test correctly, but I kind of doubt that considering US has one of the highest death rates in the developed world. </p>

<p>Hmmm, maybe I am reading it wrong but it seems that they are saying that the CDC does not <strong>require</strong> them to share the data. So I will take it up with the current president and the lax regulations observed by his appointees.</p>

        <p>It’s possible the US has different standards than the UK, because I’ve seen some states like California use up to 45 cycles in their tests which is absolutely absurd. As for your 9% number, it’s possible just less people had covid, whereas at least in the US there’s data showing up to 50% of people who have had covid don’t even know it.</p>

<p>I think this was an estimate that was done before the start of the mass testing. Probably the percentage is lower, especially when you test with very sensitive test such the PCR one (false negatives are very unlikely especially after the 5th day of contact when the viral load is starting to surge). </p>
<p>From the hospital where I work rapid tests for COVID are admissible as proof the patient has it but we always confirm it with a PCR test and the clinical presentation of the patient.</p>

        <p>So... I don't know what you think it says but this WHO statement just says that there is a particular type of a PCR where it can be a little to sensitive (which is normal as different tests can have different levels of sensitivity and specifity) and advises laboratories and medical personal working with it to correlate it with clinical presentation of the patient and with borderline positive tests the report urges healthcare providers to do a retesting.</p>
<p>All these things we already do. No patients are admitted to a hospital only because of a positive test, you need clinical indications for hospitalization (unless you are POTUS) and retesting is rather common.</p>
<p>Also I have to mention that there is no perfect test (100% specifity and 100% sensitivity) and currently the PCR tests are the best we can do. All tests have their pros and cons. For instance the antibody tests for COVID have very high specifity but way lower sensitivity. Meaning it is especially common to not get a positive result before the symptoms start and this will not help us limit the amount of exposure that happens especially with COVID where a person can be infective <strong>before</strong> they get their first symptom.</p>
<p>Early PCR testing can also help get people earlier to work after they have been exposed to a infectious person. You don't need to wait for symptoms you can test on the fifth day from the contact and because of the high sensitivity it is very unlikely to get a false negative test, which helps curb the infection rate (if people follow doctors advise).</p>
<p>Tl;dr: your source did not show what you claimed "PCR tests are inaccurate/not ment to be used for diagnostic perpouses, etc". What they said is that it is imperfect test (all tests are imperfect) and informed medical personal of the disadvantages of wide spread testing with a high sensitivity test.</p>
