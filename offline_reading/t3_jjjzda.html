        <p><strong>100%</strong></p>
<p>There is something that the governments all around the world don't want to talk about, and that the media talks about but very discretely, which is <strong>the amount of people who died in the nursing homes and the conditions in which they died.</strong></p>
<p>It is calculated that approx. 50% to 60% of the people who allegedly died from covid19 died in nursing homes, with no medical treatment of any kind and completely isolated from their families. First of all, the vast majority of the nursing homes has no medical equipment or staff to attend sick old people. But moreover, due to the lockdown restrictions, the nursing homes staff was reduced to the minimum. There are cases of nursing homes with 300 residents that only had 2 or 3 nurses to attend them all, and the 3 shifts. Many of these people died due to lack of treatment and care, plus lack of contact, but they were counted as "covid19 deaths". Tragic as it sounds. </p>
<p>I leave a press article which talks about the way they "handled" the nursing homes issue in New York, but this was also all around the world: <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ap-top-news-understanding-the-outbreak-new-york-andrew-cuomo-health-212ccd87924b6906053703a00514647f">https://apnews.com/article/ap-top-news-understanding-the-outbreak-new-york-andrew-cuomo-health-212ccd87924b6906053703a00514647f</a></p>

        <p>The husband of the world's oldest couple just died because of this. Yea, maybe you can give an excuse that he was too old, but that's just hand waving. He died at 110, so lived through two world wars and the vietnam war, the 1918 Flu, the Asian Flu, and social isolation finally killed him!</p>
<p>You can kill infants simply by not giving them attention and leaving them in a quiet, and dark place for days on end.</p>
<p>You can also break a perfectly healthy, and well adjusted person if you put them in solitary confinement for a month.</p>
<p>These elites don't care about this. You think Hitler cared? What about the millions of Chinese massacred by the Japanese leaders and soldiers?</p>
