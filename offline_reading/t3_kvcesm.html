<title>400 out of 67,000,000 died without already having a co morbidity, so essentially a non event then? I bet more than 400 have died as a result of the lockdowns.</title>

        <p>No, I believe nothing I hear, only what I actually experience and see. </p>
<p>What I have seen is a cascade of lies telling us we are all going to die, while the only death I have seen has been a result of the government countermeasures.</p>
<p>A pandemic so deadly the only way the average person knows about this  is because it‚Äôs been rammed down their throat on every sign and channel.</p>
<p>Like I say lie once to me and you loose credibility, government was caught telling lies from the very first instance. I am not going to convince you, and you aren‚Äôt convincing me. </p>

<p>Jesus, what a disingenuous statement and impossible way to exist. </p>
<p>How can you possibly experience this if you don't do anything in the medical world. In what scenario are you getting personal experience of rammed ITUs or those dying of COVID? I'm assuming you have never seen a giraffe either? I'm guessing they are mythical too. Lets say you get cancer, how are you ever gonna get chemo because you won't have 'personally' experienced the chemo. What a fatuous stance.</p>
<p>&rt;So please stop coming here and spouting your white noise into this corner of the social ocean, you have your own place</p>
<p>I can be actively against permanence of our current living situation and quest efficacy of interventions WITHOUT denying that ppl are dying or that there is significant strain on health resources. They are not mutually exclusive, we don't have to be tinfoiled nutters fearing some sort of communist invasion or a Bill Gates led NWO infiltration or whatever the newest bullsit is</p>

        <p>Why are you so intent on ramming your ideology down my throat? Don‚Äôt like?don‚Äôt invest time, this a page for dissenters. </p>
<p>I am self sufficient I live off grid, I don‚Äôt really partake in your society. I grow my own food, and rear my own meats, I keep rabbits and guinea pigs, I have solar and water generators and a spring. My kids know how to forage and butcher and grow, none of this is covered in our society‚Äôs education system, which teaches us to be obedient peons and rely on government to provide.</p>
<p>I have seen giraffes I am quite well traveled as a result of not spending a fortune on the food and shite our society rams onto us.</p>
<p>Every motorway sign has some 3 word slogan to implant on your subconscious, every tv channel can‚Äôt help but mention covid, every radio can‚Äôt go 10 mins without mentioning it.  If it was as deadly and rife as they said I would expect Black Plague level where everyone flees the urban environment and bolts their doors. (ICU is rammed every year, look at the news for the last 30 years)</p>
<p>Fuck chemotherapy, my first wife died young of breast cancer at 25, the chemo did not help it just ruined her remaining time. Cancer is on the rise as a direct result of the filth this society has created. I will take my money and go on Holliday until I die if I end up down that road. I am no stranger to death I have watched most of family die young selling their short lives to this society for a meagre empty existence as a slave chasing a carrot. I was orphaned at 14, and have had to make my own way in this world.</p>
<p>I am not denying people are suffering death of covid, but again it‚Äôs the unhealthy of society, fat/diabetic, end of life on the whole. The average age of covid death is 82 the same as the average life expectancy. Why make everyone suffer due to the poor health choices of the masses? If you are at risk then that‚Äôs not really my fault or my problem. Being alive is a deadly business, the world doesn‚Äôt owe you shit.</p>
<p>This society you are proud to be a part of is failing miserably, it‚Äôs greedy and narcissistic. Most of you don‚Äôt know that you don‚Äôt know what the hell is going on, you think you have all the answers and you can ram your agenda down my throat and get angry when people like me don‚Äôt buy in. I certainly don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on,but it smells rotten, when something smells rotten it‚Äôs already gone off. The west has disappeared so far up it‚Äôs own arsehole it can‚Äôt even see it.</p>
<p>You can call me insane or crazy or whatever, but if we are 3 days from famine it‚Äôs the people like you who will die not me or mine, if this all comes tumbling down. </p>
<p>You are so invested in the system you can‚Äôt survive without it, which is why you believe everything you are told?</p>

        <p>So in summary:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You live off the grid so are self isolating inadvertently and the 'off grid' people have higher rates of suicide. Would explain your personal experiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You both attack the world and society in which you rely on for medicine, solar power etc etc. A wilderness equivalent of a champagne socialist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fuck anyone who is not me or my friends, you deserve it. I have suffered in my life so I must take my petty vindictiveness out on others.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&rt;This society you are proud to be a part of is failing miserably, it‚Äôs greedy and narcissistic. Most of you don‚Äôt know that you don‚Äôt know what the hell is going</p>
<p>Lots of projection there mate and not even slightly fucking relevant. You are making a lot of assumptions on zero evidence. Modern society is shit but the answer is not hiding in the forest, failing in critical analysis and believing in baseless conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>&rt;I certainly don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on,but it smells rotten, when something smells rotten it‚Äôs already gone off. The west has disappeared so far up it‚Äôs own arsehole it can‚Äôt even see it.</p>
<p>How would you know, you are LARPing as a survivalist, 'off thr grid'</p>
<p>&rt;You are so invested in the system you can‚Äôt survive without it, which is why you believe everything you are told?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would be pretty ok - I dont at all, but as I am doctor looking after COVID patients I am using that personal experience you value so much, nothing I have stated is anything but my experience.</p>

<p>How am I attacking it? I‚Äôm pointing out the idiocy of the world you bow down to.</p>
<p>Classic projection defence, learn a new tactic ;)</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt hide in the forest , you see how you made your own assumptions? You are just as wrong, and not Immune from misinformation you think being a doctor makes you morally superior? You are aware of the correlation between sociopaths/psychopaths  and medicine? </p>
<p>Failure of critical analysis? If I was that much of a failure I wouldn‚Äôt be in the position I am in, given the start I had.
And what medicine do you presume I rely on? So you have attempted to lord it over me by believing you are in a superior social position, your money won‚Äôt buy you food if there isn‚Äôt any, you see you are just a dependant, like an infant relies on its mother.</p>
<p>Difference between larp and reality.</p>
<p>You could be anything for all I know, an information agent , who the fuck knows, just a dude arguing with people of different opinions.</p>
<p>I am done here peace out.</p>

        <p>Ignorant comment. Comorbidities are indexed and rated in severity. Severe comorbidities are the ones being discussed here. Look for covid studies referencing the charleston comorbidity index, and learn.</p>

        <p>In case you hadn‚Äôt noticed it‚Äôs been over a year of nothing making sense.  You see if the powers that be and main stream hadn‚Äôt lied so often over so many issues maybe people would take them seriously?</p>
<p>There is so much documentation on the harm of lockdowns, and the psy opp fear campaign that‚Äôs been pushed to people, shot themselves in the foot big time, lie one time and all credibility evaporated, that‚Äôs how the legal system works too.....</p>

        <p>Of course it makes sense.  Covid doesn't kill healthy people, it kills those with serious pre-existing conditions brought on by miserable life habits and/or old age.  Find someone who works in an actual ICU and ask them what shape the patients are really in.  A nurse friend of ours from a larger city works with covid patients every day.  They're cancer patients, heart and lung damage patients, etc., around half were already in nursing homes for the last few months of care for their conditions.</p>

        <p>What‚Äôs the opposite of fearmongering?</p>
<p>If you are healthy, develop covid, then develop bacterial pneumonia then congratulations you now have a comorbidity. And if you died, then you died with a comorbidity. </p>
<p>Comorbidity does not equal pre-existing condition.</p>

        <p>Not a dude and most definitely not yours. </p>
<p>Curious, what definition do you use of ‚Äúcomorbidity‚Äù?</p>
<p>The medical definition is more than one illness or disease occurring in the same person at the same time.</p>
<p>So what I outlined is exactly how it works. </p>
<p>Got anything to back up your claim, my inferior?</p>

        <p>Nobody wants to have a conversation with a self righteous asshole, dude. Looking at your comment history it‚Äôs clear you‚Äôre just here to start arguments. You don‚Äôt want to debate, you want to be right. You‚Äôre here to argue with people who fundamentally do not agree with you. </p>
<p>Like I said in previous comments, a precautionary lockdown for up to two months was justified, but look at what‚Äôs happening in Europe now. Cops entering people‚Äôs homes without search warrants, people committing suicide at much higher rates, fear mongering by the government, the list of cons goes on. All for what? A virus that in a worst case scenario has a less than one percent death rate even in the elderly? </p>
<p>Masks don‚Äôt work, aerosols from your breath that could potentially carry a viral particles are way too small for your Walmart brand mask to effectively block. I see you‚Äôre active in r/Ontario. It must be cold out there. Walk outside with a mask on and see if you can see the vapor from your breath. </p>
<p>I wish I had as much faith in our governments as you do. Ignorance must be fucking bliss.</p>
