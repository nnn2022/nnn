    <strong>The ones cheering for masks. social distancing, lockdowns and isolation will regret it in the long run</strong>
    <p><p>Let's go ahead and say that masks work, lockdowns work and isolations work. Is it worth it to do all of that? All these people who end up out living people will end up in nursing homes or unable to go out due to age and or medical conditions down the road. It's so easy to focus too much on the current moment and worry about your safety right now. Yet when you get older you'll end up being so safe being taking care of by nurses you'll want your ass out of the nursing home, hospial or your bed room. These people want all this crap and to force it on others to "make each other feel safer" when your most likely at the prime of your health. All the most vulnerable people to Covid either caught it and died, got the vaccine or actually recovered from it. You're really worried about some virus coming out of no where and ending your 18, 25, 35, 45, 55 year old life because you went to Market Basket without a mask? You're really worried that by going to Costco without a mask you're going to get some granny that passed by you sick and die?  </p>
<p>People really want to think if they don't wear a mask you're killing someone with you're germs that you weren't even trying to spread (coughing on people, sneezing on people, etc.). If you go around thinking your breath or someone else's breath is a murder weapon I mean you should probably seek help at that point. People go around calling others maskless assholes for what because they want to breathe? We are asshole for wanting to enjoy the life we were given and just breathe normally like we have been doing for fucking decades? Oh and if you are saying you are fine when you wear a mask then you're not wearing one that is actually doing shit. The only one that can even really do anything is the KN95 which I see almost nobody wearing.   </p>
<p>It's sad it's so easy to follow everyone. Wearing a mask thinking you're doing your part. Nobody actually cares when they see you wearing it because they want it normalized. Don't you think if you were actually doing something that could be saving someone's life you'd get more of a praise for wearing a mask? I don't know about you guys, but I never once got a "thank you for being considerate" comment for wearing my mask. Yet as soon as I take it off everyone on social media wants to call me an ass hole. I'd rather be an ass and live my life because you know what YOU ONLY GET FUCKING ONE! I don't want my dying ass laying down on a bed wishing I had taken a trip in 2021 because I was to scared to go out anywhere! Don't worry these folks will regret staying safe now and wish they did more fun things when they were younger. It actually makes me feel sad for the future. You'll have an older generation who attempted to live a strict germ free life and be a bunch of unhappy old people. Then you'll have a younger generation who thinks they have to continue that kind of life, because they are being taught by the school more than their parents to be germaphobes.</p></p>
