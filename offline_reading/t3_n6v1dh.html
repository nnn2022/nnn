    <strong>What subreddits have you been banned from?</strong>
    <p><p>Just curious lol, I'm sure I lost count on how many subs I have been banned from on my main but here's a few from my cute little collection </p>
<p>r/rant
r/coronavirus
r/insaneparenrs
r/twoxchromosomes
r/askwomen
r/covidvaccinated
r/nostupidquestions</p>
<p>I have been permanently banned always for mentioning anything that doesn't embrace the narrative. The mods will not even say I broke a rule but that simply they didn't like what I was saying, calling me names and all that type of clown stuff. It's actually hilarious </p>
<p>So many times I read that Reddit was built upon free speech and free thinking. So much to that, not to mention that this whole sub seems to be getting censored lmao</p></p>

        <p>I've been banned from rCanada and rHockey.</p>
<p>Who the hell gets banned from rHockey??</p>
<p>In total, I'm banned in like 20 different subreddits.  I've even received bans from subreddits I've never even posted in (I was quite proud of that).  </p>
<p>I wear them all like a Badge.  If they're banning you, it means you're doing something right.</p>

        <p>Permanently banned from covidvaccinated just because I post here. I made one very respectful and educated comment and the ban was instantaneous. 
Yet they can come into this sub and spew all sorts of hateful and misinformed crap.</p>

        <p>Ive been temp banned from r/pregnancy and had some posts deleted from 2 of the parenting ones.
Why? Because I merely engaged in the convo the OPs were tryinng to make on vaccine and injury. No big rant, no scientic facts. Nope, just a story of my nephew and grandma. Its really pathetic that Reddit allows such censorship. I imagine a few pregnant women sitting on their comp "oh no.... oh no... " shivering with fear and reporting me. Prob not but its what I imagine. </p>
<p>The problem is that some people take Reddit very seriously. They dont have people in their lives to give them advice and really want reddit to make deep impact on their lives. It's why I try to answer questions honestly and respectfully because you never know whos on the other side of the question ready to give up on life and needs to hear an encouraging or truthful word. One parenting forum I was deleted on was of an OP posting how his 4 mo old died today.. needing grief support. His child literally just died and he was devastated. He only said 1 sentence on the fact that yest his girl took all of her vaccines and began convulsing that night. He got such mean responses, got called a liar, and eventially banned. I followed his profile and he went to r/grief where he was accepted and encouraged. </p>
<p>I wish subreddits would be open. "Will ban if u dont follow any of the lying social norms that our culture tries to convince us of. We prefer you are a robot with no mind". </p>
<p>Glad subreddits like this one, and r/grief exist. As a parent Im pretty disgused and concerned that the parent ones are full of such angry parents to be honest.</p>

        <p>What happens if reddit is being sued? They promise a platform of free speech so they should keep that promise instead of censorship.</p>
