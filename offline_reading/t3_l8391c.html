        <p>It's a great parallel.  People thought cats were carrying the plague, and killed them off in great numbers.  They got it wrong.  Then they thought it had been the rats, and killing the cats was a huge mistake because they were natural predators of the rats, and this was probably a contributing factor.  But in truth, it was fleas/lice on humans that transmitted the virus.  All the popular theories during the plague were completely wrong! Who knew that was possible!</p>

        <p>Masks didn't work for that either and the survival rate wasn't &rt;99%.</p>
<p>on a side note, if anyone wants to read an alternative theory on the black plague check out this book.</p>

        <p>I read about it recently. According to my history book it had a 70% fatality rate. So it wiped out about one 3rd of the population of Europe, if I remember correctly. Covid in comparison has a 99.74% survival rate. They didn't turn society into a dystopia in response to it, they just lived as normally as possible. There was no talk of closed schools, or anti social distancing, or tracking contacts. Granted there were some truly horrible things that happened like creepy plague doctors wearing beaked masks and carts carrying off dead bodies. But apart from that they behaved as normal according to my book. They recognised the value of human society and human connection especially in the time of an illness. It was a bacterial infection they believe, so could have been cured by antibiotics but they weren't invented yet.</p>
<p>Hearing about the bubonic plague was one of the many things that confirmed how our current approach to this view virus is nothing but media driven madness.</p>

        <p>The point is, that disease was much, much more fatal than this one, and even then their measures were minimal. The book I read made no mention of schools being closed. I think ultimately, the idea of turning society into a dystopia to fight a disease hadn't been thought up yet. They lived as best as they could alongside the disease, whereas now people are happy for society to be destroyed, for a virus with a very small fatality rate.</p>

        <p>Once again their was no school, and they couldn’t turn it into a “dystopia” because of 2 main reasons </p>
<p>1 - they didn’t know how it spread and they didn’t know that you could spread it before showing symptoms, and even despite this they did stay away from people with the disease </p>
<p>2 - unlike today where you can order food online, if they didn’t go outside they would starve, period.</p>

        <p>I can see that you posted this question in bad faith, as you are not wanting a genuine, calm and rational discussion about our views on the plague. I have shared mine, and I disagree with you completely. I maintain that back then, they realised that ruining society, destroying people's lives, criminalising social interaction and bankrupting the country was not a sane and rational response. I stated that the book I read mentioned no schools, so I've seen no evidence that they closed them.</p>
<p>If you can't see that society is a dystopia, then I don't know what to say, because it must mean that you don't value freedom or human rights very much. I think you might feel more at home in one of the doomer subreddits, rather than trying to 'gotcha' people who are against lockdowns.</p>
<p>Your post is a classic example of sea-lioning, so I will not be responding further and wasting my time.</p>

        <p>I did comment for a civil conversation, but when you blatantly about something ridiculous and then refuse to listen to even the idea that your wrong is, contrary to popular belief, not very civil.</p>
<p>School for example - mandatory school was implemented first in England  in 1840, the bubonic plague mainly stopped being the world wide problem around 1400s. So if something didn’t exist during a certain period, and you are reading a book about said period, then logic dictates that the book about that period wouldn’t mention something that didn’t exist at that time.</p>
