    <strong>Reading List</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve been working on a philosophical reading list I think would be beneficial in resisting the techno-fascism we are being faced with and helps to explain (if even, only to our selves) why we are opposed to this. It’s obviously incomplete. If anybody has suggestions put em in. I think it’s important we get learned up on this because I think arguing people on data and data points and/or this study vs that study is somewhat useless at this point. I’d rather pick a fight in the philosophical realm.</p>
<p>I recommend the following:</p>
<p>Jacques Ellul “The Technological Society”</p>
<p>Jacques Ellul “Propaganda”&lt;- learn to spot the bullshit</p>
<p>Thomas Kuhn “Structures of Scientific Revolutions”&lt;- learn why science is never settled</p>
<p>F.A. Hayek “The Road to Serfdom” &lt;- learn the precedents other societies implemented before authoritarianism took its roots</p>
<p>F.A. Hayek “Scientism and the Study of Society” (essay) &lt;- haven’t read but want to, probably pertinent</p>
<p>Alexander Solzhenitsyn “The Gulag Archipelago” &lt;- just started but damn, the chapter of arrest should speak volumes</p>
<p>Frederic Bastiat “The Law”</p>
<p>Fyodor Dostoevsky “The Grand Inquisitor” (chapter from the Brother’s Karamazov) &lt;-Definitely read this to understand the authoritarian psychology</p>
<p>John Taylor Gatto “Weapons of Mass Instruction” &lt;- explains why so many are already obedient subservients </p>
<p>Some of these I’m still reading through myself but what I’ve been reading thus far justifies putting them on this list. </p>
<p>Hope to learn of some I should check out.</p></p>

        <p>Neil Postman, "Technopoly" and "The Disappearance of Childhood". Probably the sharpest media critic ever. Lucky for us he was alive to see the effects of computers into the 90s and 2000s and his predictions are pretty much exactly what has come to pass. His writing is so compelling that we got rid of our TVs and home internet. Postman is where I first heard the term "Scientism".</p>
<p>Speaking of spooky accurate predictions, If you like Jacques Ellul, you'll <em>love</em> Uncle Ted's "Industrial Society and It's Future"</p>

        <p>Awesome!, will definitely check out Neil Postman. I’ve read uncle Ted’s Industrial Society and It’s Future which led me to Ellul. Unfortunately uncle Ted has a certain connotation attached to him which a lot of people can’t seem to shake haha despite his ideas being sound.</p>

        <p>It's tangential to your request, but I would recommend "The Fourth Turning", by Strauss and Howe.  It describes the underlying societal and general forces that have brought us to this moment.</p>

        <p>I think BNW is the prequel to 1984 in a certain sense. They’ve been trying to use the totalitarian “enslave them with kindness” tactic Huxley spoke of. Unfortunately I think it will always lead to Orwell’s brutal dystopia in the end. Especially when it’s left in the hands of a select few</p>

        <p>State of Fear by Michael Crichton is one that has come to mind often in the past year. It’s fiction and about global warming but the premise of controlling people by keeping them afraid of one thing or another is applicable.</p>

        <p>Fiction has its place at the table no doubt! Sometimes it’s more powerful than purely philosophical work because literary work  has the ability to put us in the shoes of the characters. Let’s add it! I read Chrichton’s “Pirate Latitudes” and it was the shit.  He’s a great writer</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Prometheus Unbound</strong>: "But thou, who art the God and Lord: O, thou, Who fillest with thy soul this world of woe, To whom all things of Earth and Heaven do bow in fear and worship: all-prevailing foe! I curse thee! let a sufferer's curse Clasp thee, his torturer, like remorse; Till thine Infinity shall be A robe of envenomed agony; And thine Omnipotence a crown of pain, To cling like burning gold round thy dissolving brain."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</strong>: "Those who restrain desire do so because theirs is weak enough to be restrained; and the restrainer usurps its place and governs the unwilling. And being restrained it by degrees becomes passive, till it is only the shadow of desire. The history of this is written in Paradise Lost, and the Governor is called Messiah."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Mysteries of Cain</strong>: "[We are] Souls who dare use their immortality–– Souls who dare look the Omnipotent tyrant in His everlasting face, and tell him that His evil is not good! If he has made, As he saith––which I know not, nor believe–– But, if he made us––he cannot unmake: We are immortal!––nay, he'd have us so, That he may torture:––let him! He is great–– But, in his greatness, is no happier than We in our conflict! Goodness would not make Evil; and what else hath he made? But let him Sit on his vast and solitary throne–– Creating worlds, to make eternity Less burthensome to his immense existence And unparticipated solitude; Let him crowd orb on orb: he is alone Indefinite, Indissoluble Tyrant; Could he but crush himself, 'twere the best boon He ever granted: but let him reign on! And multiply himself in misery! Spirits and Men, at least we sympathise–– And, suffering in concert, make our pangs Innumerable, more endurable, By the unbounded sympathy of all With all! But He! so wretched in his height, So restless in his wretchedness, must still Create, and re–create––perhaps he'll make One day a Son unto himself––as he Gave you a father––and if he so doth, Mark me! that Son will be a sacrifice!... Evil and Good are things in their own essence, And not made good or evil by the Giver; But if he gives you good–so call him; if Evil springs from him, do not name it mine, Till ye know better its true fount; and judge Not by words, though of Spirits, but the fruits Of your existence, such as it must be. One good gift has the fatal apple given - Your reason: let it not be overswayed–By tyrannous threats to force you into faith 'Gainst all external sense and inward feeling"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Satanic Bible</strong>: "Satan represents undefiled wisdom, instead of hypocritical self-deceit! Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it, instead of love wasted on ingrates! Satan represents vengeance, instead of turning the other cheek! Satan represents responsibility to the responsible, instead of concern for psychic vampires!"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Diabolicon</strong>: "And so I saw that God would not recognize a Will apart from its own, and I was seized with horror, for I perceived that the final scheme of God would destroy creation in all things, and the Cosmos would become as a concentric mechanism whose function would be not to create anew, but rather to freeze into perpetuity that which already was. Whereupon a great resolve arose within me, and I determined to contest this limit to existence. And so once again I sought to illuminate the minds of all Angels with my visions."</p>
