    <strong>For your Pro-Vax friends who bring up the polio Vaccine and smallpox vaccine in regards to the covid-Vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>Research Paper talking about how the polio Vaccine was NOT the Main reason polio was eradicated around the 1940's  and that 
94% of polio patients had no symptoms WHATSOEVER, (sounds like covid huh) </p>
<p>^^^^^
https://linksharing.samsungcloud.com/muyoqIWTLDIe </p>
<p>Article talking about the horrible effects of the small pox vaccine in the 1800's
^^^^^^^^
https://dailyexpose.co.uk/2021/03/31/vaccination-the-greatest-lie-ever-told-part-1/</p>
<p>Article about the Defective Polio vaccine in 1954 which caused 40,000 cases of polio </p>
<p>^^^^^^^^^
https://thevaccinereaction.org/2016/01/the-salk-polio-vaccine-tragedy/ </p>
<p>The article explaining how pertussis or whooping cough Vaccine is to blame for the ressurgence of the disease in todays society, because it does NOT prevent transmission but suppresses the symptoms of the illness (like the covid vaccine) they literally state “This disease is back because we didn’t really understand how our immune defenses against whooping cough worked, and did not understand how the vaccines needed to work to prevent it,” said Christopher J. Gill, associate professor of global health and lead author of the article. “Instead we layered assumptions upon assumptions, and now find ourselves in the uncomfortable position of admitting that we may made some crucial errors. This is definitely not where we thought we’d be in 2017.”
https://www.bu.edu/sph/news/articles/2017/resurgence-of-whooping-cough-may-owe-to-vaccines-inability-to-prevent-infections/</p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30793754/ </p>
<p>Article explaining that because of the pertussis vaccine people who have received it will now be more susceptible to it due to the vaccine and it will have that effect on them for probably the rest of their life</p>
<p>Due to Linked epitope supression 
Linked epitope suppression applies as the immune response to the new epitopes is suppressed by the strong response to the original vaccine components. Which in term WEAKENS THE IMMUNE SYSTEM</p>
<p>Next time your pro-vax friends bring up polio or smallpox vaccines as a excuse to get the COVID VACCINE point them to these facts that, are unbiased and use real facts!</p></p>

        <p>Muh polio vaccine is easily debunked: SV-40 contamination in the vaccine is causing <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10472327/">cancer</a> in baby boomer who had the shot as kids. Vaccine injuries can manifest with fatal consequences decades after the injection.</p>

        <p>By magic of government all these diseases have dissapeared.  </p>
<p>And the trick is simple, find a disease that is vanishing on its own and claim your victory when it indeed is eradicated.  </p>
<p>But have to also mention that some vaccines are really nice to have, for example against yellow fever.</p>

        <p>Let me re-iterate, 94% of people had no symptoms of polio, ofc the picture is sad but doesnt have anything to do with vaccination heck we dnt even know if either one of them were truly vaccinated, and just as there was children that had it (polio) there was some who didnt, vaccine or no vaccine, its all in the article i listed, no a photo</p>
