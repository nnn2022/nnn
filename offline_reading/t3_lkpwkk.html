    <strong>My chronically ill mother is getting the vax and will not listen</strong>
    <p><p>She’s arguing with me “I have to get the vaccine or I will die!”  She has fibro, diabetes type 1, and a number of other serious respiratory and auto immune issues. </p>
<p>It literally pains me to argue with her and she tells me the benefit of the vaxx outweighs the risk of COVID. She won’t listen and has her appointment Thursday. I feel sick to know that my mother won’t even wait to see the long term side effects and is going ahead and do it. Even though it’s a year into the pandemic and she has not gotten the virus. She says it’s because she wears a mask and sanitizes. </p>
<p>Nothing has changed her mind, the fact that these companies cannot be held liable, that people have already died, the shady fact that the government is attempting to FORCE IT, or the long term side effects that have not been seen yet. </p>
<p>You guys have any extra information I can send to her?  I do not want to allow my mother to get this vaccine without at least earnestly trying to change her mind.</p></p>
