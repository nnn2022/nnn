    <strong>My Favourite "Family Farm Market" Is Open For Perfectly Healthy People</strong>
    <p><p>The "Mask required" sign was finally gone after 12 months of Draconian Mask mandates from BC's Provincial Health Officer Bonnie Henry ended.</p>
<p>For about 3-4 days, there was no sign of change in many businesses, but was glad to see that my favourite 'family-owned farm market' no longer required Masks in the store.</p>
<p>I hope this trend continues, as now us perfectly healthy People now have choice back, and can start voting with our wallets and break the Cult of the Mask's hold on our society.</p>
<p>It's been pretty gloomy for me over this issue, as I understand safety is important, but going 12 months of this, and having food, medicine and essential services held ransom from me was something I took personally.</p>
<p>I still remain guarded though, for as some stores will lift them and allow perfectly healthy People to now enter without being harassed, other businesses are moving to QR codes and talk of mandatory vaccination for their workers.</p>
<p>But like I have said, this all began with the Mask, and will end with the Mask, as it is the only VISIBLE artifact of covid19 in 99% of people's lives - so when it goes away, all this other BS that people can peddle loses power daily.</p>
<p>So good news. Let's hope this spreads like wildfire and we bust up this nonsense and get back to life.</p></p>

        <p>And sadly I’m never going to stop wearing the mask, I’m going to remind humanity of this event every chance I get, they imposed on freedoms once, may as well remind them they can do it again because they never learn from history. But the catch is that my mask doesn’t do shit except let me smoke, eat and drink without anyone seeing my face. It’s a cult tool just like they intended, except I’m doing it right and I’ll abuse it long after it’s gone. It’s not my cult so I don’t mind abusing them.</p>
