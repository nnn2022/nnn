        <p>I stopped trusting the mainstream media long ago. 
Fool me once, shame on you. 
Fool me twice, shame on me.
If you continue to believe the same habitual liar, what does that say about you?</p>

        <p>You really believe that? Antifa is a bunch of violent thugs, too, but the President organized the capitol riot.</p>
<p>The people came from his rally wearing Trump gear and waving Trump flags. Many of them have been arrested and interviewed, and they are very clear about being there for Trump, to support Trump's lies about a stolen election, because they interpreted his words before and during the rally as a call for them to storm the capitol and prevent the certification of the election results. </p>
<p>What would Antifa want with that crowd? To frame the Trumpists? That doesn't hold water when you've seen the interviews with the folks who took part in the capitol riot. They are Trump superfans. Are you suggesting that a small group of Antifa whipped up the Trump supporters into a frenzy and persuaded them to go to the capitol? Because it's far more likely that they were whipped into a frenzy by their beloved Trump himself and the rest of the speakers at the rally.</p>

        <p>I assume this is about the capitol. In which case, they didn't walk in to protest. They broke in. And they beat up people, one of them to death.</p>
