    <strong>Where/When/How should I share this sub with others, or should I?</strong>
    <p><p>Those of you who frequent both subs may recognize that I asked this question on r/LockdownSkepticism a few months ago, and you may understandably find it redundant for me to ask the same thing here. However, while there is considerable overlap between these communities, they are not the same. So I ask the fine folks here:</p>
<p>In what circumstances should I share this sub with others? Far too often, I see people express "controversial" thoughts and feelings that would be welcome here but I'd rather not attract the wrong kind of attention by carelessly dropping a link. So how exactly should I go about reaching out?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any insight!</p></p>

        <p>I'm one of the mods here, along with /u/SpiderImAlright.  I agree with you about /r/LockdownSkepticism, that it has become far too locked down (how ironic), and there seems to be no rhyme or reason to what they do and do not allow through.  I stopped posting there a long time ago, since I'm not going to waste my time posting there and then have most of what I share never see the light of day.  I absolutely do not want to lock down this subreddit like that, because I am a firm proponent of letting the upvotes and downvotes of the userbase decide these things.  I have been combing through all of the posts in the "unmoderated posts" queue, and it seems like we have many good posts, and a lot of good discussions from all different points of view.  I don't see anything that would be considered to come from "crazies", which is what the other subreddit used as justification for locking everything down.</p>
<p>As far as my own views go, I am very much a leftist, but I can't get behind this change to everyone's lives primarily fueled by fear.  "Keep calm and wash your hands" seems to be the soundest advice that I've heard.  I find myself thinking, "I used to respect you," about a whole lot of friends of mine who have advocated going through all of these ridiculous hoops in the name of safety.  Ultimately, for the vast majority of the population, there is nothing that we can do about this, and anything that we are asked to do is security theater.  I also work in an "essential" field (public transportation), and so I have been going to work regularly throughout this whole ordeal.  I also have been going out regularly doing photography.</p>
<p>That said, as far as how to promote our subreddit, I tend to promote it via comment replies to people whom I think would be friendly to that cause.  I won't make a big post about it, and even in those comment replies, I still manage to get the dagger symbol (†) and negative points.</p>

        <p>As someone who leans a bit more right on many issues, but gets called everything from far right to far left, I sincerely thank you for being a leftist. You prove that people on both sides of the aisle take issue with the new normal.</p>

        <p>I myself identify as liberal, I believe in liberal values although some mistake me as "libertarian" because I am also anti-authoritarian and a constitutionalist, though I lean left of center and disagree on the typical "libertarian" on a few things (I don't agree with "progressives" on the left on some things either).  </p>
<p>Despite the stereotypes you don't need to be right winged to see how the "new normal" is fucked up, I was against the lockdowns from the beginning.</p>

        <p>I take the 8values quiz and other related quizzes maybe once a month for fun, and apparently I went from being a green libertarian last month to a libertarian capitalist today. LeftValues consistently regards me as utopian socialist, while RightValues thinks I'm a classical liberal today, though the questions seem different from last time. Make of all that what you will.</p>
<p>Have also been against the lockdowns from the beginning. Not that I wasn't initially concerned about the virus itself, but it doesn't take a rocket surgeon to see how corporations and governments take advantage of a crisis to further consolidate power, degrading individuals, families, local communities, and small businesses in the process. I'd still probably oppose the lockdowns even if this really was a literal plague, because people wouldn't need to be forced or coerced into taking precautions if bodies actually were piling up in the streets.</p>

        <p>This sub is still full truthers... Lockdown Skepticism has been over taken by a propaganda PR firm and bots, it's now apparently good to wear masks in that sub. What they did is pushed out any truthers by deleting posts that claimed the global lockdown hoax was an agenda or anything resembling that.</p>
<p>Also if you notice on that sub, there's an extreme amount of UK news which is the most propaganda driven on earth, BBC and Guardian articles... There as fake and narrative-agenda driven as CNN. The kings of " polls " and according to " experts "</p>

        <p>Not sure... Doesn't matter tho, almost everyone I know in real life is against the lockdown and things associated with the " new normal ". We the people will likely lose in the end, and if any real push back is to be made against this hoax, it will be by voting with your wallet and writing petitions to local politicians making them aware they will not get re-elected if they keep this up.</p>
<p>You think local politicians and federal government politicians are ready to lose their place and status for some davos/bill gates/ deep state new world order agenda ? The politicians who are against this stuff should be voted for, that's how we get our freedom back, online chatting won't make a difference, just makes people more aware...</p>

        <p>We don't practice the same amount of heavy curation of posts that /r/LockdownSkepticism does.  Unlike them, we're letting the votes decide.  Posts are visible immediately upon submission, and then it's up to the userbase to vote on them.  My beef with /r/LockdownSkepticism is that the moderators are crafting the subreddit themselves through the approval process (their alleged high standards) rather than letting the userbase craft the subreddit and using moderation just to keep things under control.  Most of what I do, moderation-wise, is approving posts, mostly to check for spam and things that inadvertently get caught in the spamtrap, and obvious trolls.  My stance on group moderation is that the moderator who moderates best moderates least.  I don't want to throw my weight around with the moderator hat.  No one wants a loudmouth moderator who acts like a dictator.  I'm here if I'm needed, but I'm a participant first, and moderator second.  I also don't have the time to practice heavy moderation.  I have a full-time job and a website, and that takes up a lot of my time.</p>

        <p>To be fair some of the conspiracy stuff can be kinda ridiculous, like there was this one guy here last week who posted an incoherent rant on how he thought the lockdowns and everything were orchestrated by the Catholics who are plotting to take over the world with the typical tropes like FEMA camps and also rambled about how he's the eldest son descended from a lineage of barbarians who resist against the continuing Roman Empire, needless to say he got downvoted to hell and it was worth a laugh. </p>
<p>I will say I don't believe in censorship and I don't like how r/LockdownSkepticism has been heavy handed on what they allow lately though, I'd rather let the nutbags post and get debated, laughed at, or downvoted. </p>
<p>But still, the sub still provides a lot of good evidence for being against lockdowns.</p>
