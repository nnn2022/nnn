    <strong>For all of you newnormal people or trolls why should we continue to wear masks?</strong>
    <p><p>Why should we continue to wear masks when..</p>
<ul>
<li>We have a vaccine that is "supposed" to protect us.</li>
<li>We caught the flu or got sick several times before, but lived it out just fine.</li>
<li>If wearing a mask made the flu disappear shouldn't it have made Covid disappear? If it works against the flu, but then Covid is still spreading then it can't mean not a lot of people are wearing masks. If the flu disappears for wearing a mask then Covid should too. Let's face it you are not wearing the mask against Covid knowing Covid is still spreading. You're wearing it because you think it's some magical protection that would prevent you from getting sick for a couple of days.</li>
<li>Variants doesn't mean more deadly. They just mean that something spreads more. The variants isn't making Covid anymore deadly than it is. A variant is created when the virus is trying to find other ways to enter into your system. If  you got sniffles the first time around from Covid getting from it's 10th variant doesn't mean you are going to go from sniffles to death. It might eventually end up in death, but that will be because of aging and medical conditions that may develop overtime that eventually your immune system will struggle to fight it off. However, if you're young and healthy that's not going to happen for another 40-50 years or so at least.</li>
<li>Your number of cases and deaths continue to go down across the country. Apparently according to the experts we are back to where we were before the "pandemic" hit. Except now you guys have an experimental vaccine that you didn't have a year ago that you can take so you can feel better about going out again.</li>
<li>You had over 365 to catch Covid. Chances are pretty high if you went out and did your everyday shopping. Even if you had a mask on the entire time. Let's pretend masks work, did you wear gloves the entire time you went out? If you didn't the moment you came home you brought the virus home if you had it. Odds are you probably had Covid and made it through without showing any symptoms. Heck you might have even had Covid and only had a cough or fever just like anyone that would normally be sick have. My point is if you were able to make it this far odds are you have a pretty good immune system already. That or you really did stay in your home the whole time.</li>

        <p>No comments, let’s hear it. I am just as curious. Answer OP’s questions. I would suggest you directly address how useless masks are. Remember the hospital masks say on the box they don’t defend against corona virus, cloth mask increase transmission and N95 requires a perfect seal on your face. Defend less the back end and remind them that masks are a literal waste of time.</p>

        <p>Like this entire subreddit. I dont see posts discussing about the new normality, just to support their own oppinions about vaccines, masks and all things that they hate about the new normality.</p>

<li>A lot of people are not vaccinated yet.</li>
<li>The new coronavirus is not like other flues or illness, a lot of people died and the hospitals were full for months.</li>
<li>The masks doesnt make the virus to dissapear, just helps to protect us and other people.</li>
<li>
<p>If the virus spreads faster more people could get affected faster so the hospitals will be full again, and more people will die. Even if you are young you could get syntomes anyway but even if that is not the case other people will get then and even die.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are not good yet but we are better abd that is because of the masks, the vaccines, the quarantine, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Masks doesnt even work 100% of the time but helps. And even if we dont wear gloves we washed our hands often and that helped to prevent us to get the covid. There are still people who didn’t got the covid but not we are safer because of the vaccines, but we still should be care anyway and keep ussing the masks when we are with a lot of people around us, washing our hands, keeps social distance and everything.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We are better now but we are not safe yet. Maybe you don’t care about yourself but be care of the people around you.</p>

<li>
<p>Just because other people aren't getting vaccinated doesn't mean you should wear a mask. That doesn't make sense. Why is your life restricted becsuse of other people's choices?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The survival rate of the virus is over 99.7. How do we know all those people in hospitals were suffering just from Covid? Just because the news said so?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fauci himself said masks do very little then all the sudden he tells us we need them? Explain that one to me. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We have been lied to and taking advice from someone who liberally funded the "research" that caused the pandemic to even happen.</p>

<p>We should wear a mask because a lot of people can get the covid vaccinated or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not everyone but enought people to have the hospitals full.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if the masks are not 100% effective they helps to protect us and the people around us. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We were not lied, we missed information and there are also fake news that confuse the people, that is why is the best to look for news in  a lot of places and check scientific articles.</p>
