    <strong>My husband just took our kid to the hospital</strong>
    <p><p>I'm posting this here because we were talking about the mask thing earlier... </p>
<p>Kiddo fell off the couch and probably broker her hand. She was in enough pain that she needs to be looked at. I was getting dressed to go and my husband volunteered to go. </p>
<p>15 years of marriage and he's never once volunteered to be the parent to do a doctor appointment or ER trip. He did this time because he knew that it would be a struggle for me to sit there all night with a mask on. </p>
<p>I'm kinda glad he did, but I also feel bad... It's almost 1:30am. He's the one working 40 hours a week... I hate that he felt like he had to do this. </p>
<p>I don't like this new normal. But I don't know how to fix it.</p></p>

        <p>you are a good mom, he is a good dad. please don't beat yourself up. you brought your child into the world - that's a lot of pain and sacrifice. your husband is putting in his time and flesh.</p>
<p>i hope your kid is okay - kids break stuff all the time, they heal, they move on, they forget it. my mom said i broke my left foot when i was two - lol, i remember nothing, my foot is fine, i love my mother. all parents can do is just accept that we all hurt ourselves as kids and we heal and move on.</p>
<p>give the hubz a beej and call it even :) the new normal sucks, but so do you - keep on trucking, and it will be fine. and hopefully, masks won't be forever.</p>

        <p>I like that idea! </p>
<p>They'll be on the way home soon... They finally got it set and splinted. </p>
<p>He did tonight but she'll have 2 appointments at Children's next week that I'll have to deal with. Hopefully they won't take too long so I won't have to be masked for too long. But I'll do what I have to do.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry you’re going through this. I hope your kid heals well. I hope there is pain relief. </p>
<p>Years ago our 5 year old fell off a stool and broke her wrist. We took her to the ER. They did an x-ray and put on a splint with an ace bandage. Told us to call an orthopedist the next day. Had not paid our deductible yet. It was $1000. The orthopedist put on a fiberglass cast and charged $300. I was surprised because I always left the ER with a cast when I was a kid. The next time one of our kids broke something, we waited all weekend and called the orthopedist on Monday. They have x-rays there as well. I felt bad for waiting all weekend. I even called the ER to see whether they would do anything and they said orthopedists are only on call for serious things. Oh, and the ER nurse wanted to know why I knew the word metatarsal. I took anthropology in college and had to learn all the bones.</p>

        <p>They set it and put it in a splint... She goes to neurology next week, I wonder if we can get her appointments on the same day? </p>
<p>They have her more comfortable now too, which is good.</p>

        <p>That's what I do at amusement parks and so far I've only begrudgingly wore my mask in ride stations where the attendants are psychotic about it. I walk around the park with a souvenir mug pretending to sip soda.</p>

        <p>Poor kid....:/ I broke my hand several years ago punching a brick wall after a loved one died. Wasn't much fun at all. I don't do hospitals, so I had to treat it myself and hide it from pretty much everyone but my husband. Thankfully it was fairly minor.</p>
<p>I hope your daughter feels better, and I hope the hospital didn't do any COVID tests. Or lie and say she or your husband tested positive without even taking a test. Unfortunately, it happens. Don't beat yourself up for not going, this mask shit is going too far, just make sure your husband gets plenty of rest if it concerns you. Everything sucks right now, but it could be worse. <em>knocks on wood</em></p>
