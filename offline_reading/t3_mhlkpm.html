    <strong>A house divided.</strong>
    <p><p>I live in Texas and slowly but surely, things are starting to get back to normal. Aside from some places still enforcing masks, most businesses, especially bars and restaurants, are the busiest they've been in months. It's very encouraging and honestly, I couldn't be happier. My wife on the other hand . . . She's now more paranoid than ever and to make matters worse, she's imposing her BS mentality on our kids. I don't care if she chooses to wear a mask out in public. It's whatever I guess. Kind of annoying but that's her prerogative. One thing she did say that really bugs me though is that she plans to wear a mask even if all masks mandates are completely lifted and plans to make our daughters wear them as well. It's ridiculous. The thing that bothers me most though is, I want my kids to go back to school. These zoom sessions accomplish absolutely nothing and I really hate the fact that my daughter is glued to a screen all day. My youngest is supposed to start this fall and I'm almost certain my wife is going to contest me every step of the way. And to top this all off, all my in-laws all share the same paranoid mentality as my wife. I'm surrounded. They're all covidiots. It's pretty disappointing. I'm wondering if anyone else is in the same boat. I can't be the only one.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah honestly that sucks hard.  My wife isn't at the same level of disobedience as me but she does prioritize places where the kids can go mask free.</p>
