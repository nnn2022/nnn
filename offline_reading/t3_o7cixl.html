    <strong>permabanned from /r/solotravel but I might have saved someone's life</strong>
    <p><p>Mentioned the CDC's own VAERS stat that more people have had adverse reactions or died from the covid vax than all the other vax in the past 20 years combined; was permabanned for it for spreading "unsubstantiated lies about the covid vax." </p>
<p>I'm hearing that all we need is 62% of people awake, and then big disclosure is authorized. I don't care if I get banned from every single sub - if spreading THE TRUTH keeps even 1 person from getting the jab, then I saved someone's life. If my post caused even 1 person to do research on adverse reactions, that's pushing us closer to getting the collective at 62%. </p>
<p>I think this sub still exists because reddit's strategy is, if they let us have this space maybe we won't be speaking the truth all over the internet. But we need to. We need to pump these numbers of awake people up. We're really close. I think we're at like 60 right now. Every 1 person who doubts the mainstream brainwashing is a major victory. Every 1 person who thinks before getting it is a life saved.</p></p>

        <p>I believe they let us stick around because the extreme theories like 5G towers and nanomachines in the vaccine discredit more  substantiated claims by mere association.  I totally believe it was planned this way.</p>

        <p>Isn’t this “I might have saved someone’s life” and “if spreading the truth keeps even one person from getting the jab” nonsense the same stuff all you guys laugh at “doomers” for?</p>
<p>“I saved your Grandma”, “the greater good”, etc.?</p>
<p>Isn’t that just what you’re doing here, but without actual science?</p>

        <p>We insult you because you're a troll at best; if you're shilling for big pharma you're also complicit in mass murder.</p>
<p>Read your own post history and the general tone. All you do is talk shit and argue so that's what you'll be given in return. If you want hard science and evidence, just watch as the tens of thousands of adverse reactions, deaths, and vaccine bans grow day by day. Vaxxed pilots are no longer allowed to fly because THEY ARE DYING MID FLIGHT. Majority of health care workers are refusing the jab because THEY SEE WITH THEIR OWN EYES THAT IT'S FATAL. It's very obvious you're on here trying to discredit but it's having the opposite effect. Your attitude is so blatantly shitty that it's flipping people to our side.</p>

        <p>So first a rat, then a shill for big pharma and complicit in mass murder? What mass murder, exactly? I’m vaccinated, the only mass murder going on is from chuckleheads spreading Covid that think they’re smarter than doctors.</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”…CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said on Tuesday that the vaccine is so effective that “nearly every death, especially among adults, due to COVID-19, is, at this point, entirely preventable.” She called such deaths “particularly tragic.”</strong>
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/941fcf43d9731c76c16e7354f5d5e187">Nearly All Covid Deaths in the US Are Among Unvaccinated </a></p>
<p>I’ve got a 9-year old account, I’m so very far from a troll. And if my attitude drives you lot to calling me a rat, you’re even more thin-skinned than I thought. And if people are flipping to “your side” because of a perceived “bad attitude”, they were never really interested in science or being honest to begin with.</p>
<p>Is this not a place for discussion? Or would you rather this just be a safe space for you all to share pixelated screenshots and John McAfee pharma murder theories? I’m not trolling anyone, dude. You all say some downright outlandish shit. I’m asking questions. I’m challenging views circulated here that are based on nothing but Twitter screenshots and phantom evidence that can, for some reason, never seem to be produced. You say a lot of things, but I see no links to anything substantial. You’re being driven by manufactured anger and vitriol and it’s dangerous.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSL2N2NX252">There is no evidence that airlines are banning vaccinated pilots.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSL1N2MZ2H8">VAERS-reported vaccine deaths have not been confirmed of deemed causal by CDC.</a></p>
<p>&rt; VAERS accepts and analyzes reports of possible health problems—also called “adverse events”—after vaccination. As an early warning system, VAERS cannot prove that a vaccine caused a problem. Specifically, a report to VAERS does not mean that a vaccine caused an adverse event. But VAERS can give CDC and FDA important information. If it looks as though a vaccine might be causing a problem, FDA and CDC will investigate further and take action if needed.

<p>Do you have something that substantiates your claims? Because the things you are saying are malicious and dangerous, and I’ve not had anyone produce a single shred of evidence that couldn’t be debunked with a crayon in five minutes. It’s not even possible to “discredit” something that has zero credibility to begin with.</p>
<p>So, I’ll say this with the gentlest of tones: if you are so capable of such clarity, then I ask in good faith, will you share with me the information that has you so thoroughly convinced of all these claims?</p>
