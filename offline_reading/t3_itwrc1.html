    <strong>The oft-cited study showing masks' benefits: An agenda-driven interpretation by the statistically-naive</strong>
    <p><p>In a recent meta-analysis of 172 studies, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673620311429">Chu et al.</a> examined the effects of social distancing and mask wearing on SARS-CoV-2 transmission. I've seen this study circulated through reddit and through the media as direct and strong evidence that masks work as they say they do. The level of confidence that folks have in using this study is quite high, as if masks provide a huge effect. In my opinion, they are misunderstanding and stretching the actual findings.</p>
<p>The first red flag was the authors' admission that none of the studies included in this analysis were randomized control trials (and this isn't a critique of the authors, as they were constrained by what's out there), the gold standard in testing interventions. So from the start, you have the authors combing through 172 studies of questionable methodology, results, and generalizability. What happens when you analyze a ton of bad studies? You get a bad meta-analytic result.</p>
<p>The fact that the meta analysis consists of a smorgasbord of bad studies is perhaps why they concluded that any effects of masks (including the well-touted N95s) were of "low certainty" based on the <a href="https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelinesforguidelines/develop/assessing-certainty-evidence#_ENREF_32">GRADE approach</a> of assessing research results. The <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/145714/9789241548960_eng.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y">WHO uses these guidelines</a> to assess quality of research findings.</p>
<p>What does <em>low certainty</em> mean?</p>
<p>"Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect."</p>
<p>This is where that disconnect between the findings and the conclusion that bothers me. If you conclude low confidence combing through research with thousands and thousands of participants, what good is the effect at hand? How can someone equate "low confidence" with "strong and definite effect?"</p>
<p>Now, the person who disagrees with me may correctly suggest that low confidence still means there may be an effect (benefit) there. They may further say that the act of wearing a mask is so trivial that even if it doesn't work, no harm done (kinda like Pascal's wager with masks).</p>
<p>My response would be: in what other clinical setting would low confidence in a treatment be hailed as a robust measure? Would people tout Diet A or Exercise A as being healthy and effective if no RCTs testing it exist and any confidence in its efficacy is low? I doubt it. But, from the way that they discuss wearing masks, you'd think there is no scientific study out there that produces any more certainty than this.</p>
<p>I'd also argue that masks do come with significant costs to people‚Äîyou have to purchase numerous masks (which is a burden to those affected financially by this damn lockdown), wash them daily, avoid touching them, carry them with you where ever you go; on top of the pollution that disposable masks produce. Of course, we touch them with our dirty hands; put them in and out of our dirty pockets; touch them as they slip off our face; store our spit in them as we talk; drip our sweat into them; and still put them on our face. This just exposes people to more bacteria and viruses that they may have otherwise avoided.</p>
<p>In fact, we can do a thought exercise. Take a mask and remove its looks that attach it to your face. It becomes a small rag. Carry that rag with you in your pocket, periodically put it on your face and talk through it, put it back, repeat. I would imagine a sensible person may find that carrying such a rag around is not the best of ideas, although this could be my (mask-skeptical) bias talking.</p>
<p>Not to mention the supposed effects/benefits of masks has changed substantially since March:</p>
<p>-At first, they were useless pieces of cloth that do nothing but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRa6t_e7dgI">attract schmutz</a> to your face</p>
<p>-Then, they became <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-mask/art-20485449">vehicles to prevent spreading your germs onto others</a></p>
<p>-Now, they're becoming <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2026913">akin to vaccines</a></p>
<p>I wonder whether we will look back and acknowledge our ignorance once this ends (and now that I just saw that PA wants to make foregoing masks a misdemeanor, the point of scientific ignorance stands).</p></p>

<p>there is not one on the market.</p>
<p>they are rated @ filtration and applied based on the environment used like if you work in a wood shop, you'll need filtration @  a specific micron measurement.</p>

        <p>You're crazy. Mask mandates provide <em>huge</em> benefits. They're an extremely potent tool and symbol of fear, dehumanization, deindividualization, submission, and humiliation. The routine, universal usage of face masks in public contributes to an extraordinarily toxic, demoralizing, and dystopian environment that impedes normal (and essential to human wellness) socialization and communication, thereby significantly undermining social trust and community.</p>
<p>"Those are 'benefits'?!"</p>
<p>It depends on your agenda.</p>

        <p>the mental gymnastics to ignore:</p>
<p>&rt; far more suggests they are not effective (randomized controlled trials, data from places they were mandated long ago, etc).</p>
<p>&rt; were only recommended to be used in the most extreme pandemics before.</p>
<p>&rt; the mandates are not democratic policy. leads to more authoritarianism.</p>
<p>&rt; studies warn they could increase the risk of transmission. for several reasons.</p>
<p>&rt; health concerns (evidence of hypercapnia, reports of coughing up material, etc).</p>

        <p>There aren't even <em>any</em> RCTs on non-medical mask wear for the general public! Even studies done on healthcare workers' use of masks show mixed results (evidenced by the meta-analysis I cited). </p>
<p>From what I gathered, both masks and distances are in place not because of scientific research, but because of tradition: "it's just how it has been for a long time, so why bother changing?"</p>

        <p>I pointed out long ago that mask wearing was the same strategy used during the 1918 Spanish flu. Is mask wearing still the best strategy that health care experts can devise despite over 100 years of medical research?</p>

<p>You have a lot of faith in what it takes for laymen to support diet and exercise regimens...</p>
<p>Strongly agree with your post overall, but this point would be better made as: Would people want their doctor recommending a treatment (if no RCTs...). Even that isn‚Äôt really accurate, considering the faith people have in their doctor‚Äôs opinion.</p>

        <p>I was going to use a more "clinical" example (such as a new drug) in my post but decided against it because that would compare pharmaceutical (drug) to a non-pharmaceutical (mask) intervention. The principle applies though: I doubt folks would take a drug if a doctor says: "well, it's never actually been experimentally tested but it looks like some people who took it didn't get the disease so it definitely works."</p>
