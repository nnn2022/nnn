        <p>I agree. I will not take it. But when will more people start having effects? I am getting nervous that I was overblowing this whole thing. I should probably go research how long it takes for the vaccine to detrimentally effect people. I am starting to think the vaccine only harms like, a handful of people. I feel like the media is wearing on me. I hate going against the wind, it is wearing on me.</p>

        <p>Nobody EVER GETS ME. It is fine. I do not want to take the shot. I just feel like I am one of those people that think Jesus Christ and the rapture is coming. That's all. I just do not want to be like that. It is for sure better not to take it, but I just do not know. Sorry. I have been a Jesus follower thinking that Jesus was coming back and people a year ago said it was any day. I wish I had more evidence to know because I feel alone.</p>

        <p>That is how I have been operating thus far. I have never felt like I "need the shot" but sometimes I feel invalidated and left out and like I am actually stupid for not taking it. This just came on recently, when summer came on. I feel, more trivialized in my opinion. Thx for listening and for the advice.</p>

        <p>This world is not our home, so it shouldn't feel comfortable. I admit I wish it didn't feel so inhospitable, but that's the price of doing business so to speak.</p>
<p>The against the grain doesn't wear on me but knowing people would rather your kind wasn't on the planet has been a great lesson in perspective. It's good to be able to relate to the plight and struggle of every trivialized and persecuted group of people.  Makes me more sensitive to those who've come before me who also feel like others wished they would go away or didn't exist.</p>
<p>Let this make your heart better. Perspective is a wonderful gift. </p>
<p>Read Ecclesiastes Chapter 7.</p>
<p>Also, Ecclesiastes 1:18 has always been a source of strength. Being blissfully unaware may lead to more "happiness", and that's been drilled into people that is what life is all about. </p>

        <p>Every generation believes it's living in the End Times. What makes us so special? Do you think you're the first to live in a period of dramatic social upheaval and leaders mad with power?</p>
<p>Read a history book, and try to imagine what it was like to the people living in horrible times (war, revolution, disease, despotic governments). They didn't know the future any more than we do. Many believed there was cosmic, world-ending significance to the events they were living through. Today we only know about most of them because we were forced to as children in a boring, fluorescent-lit room for hours on end. Then we happily forget all about their struggles for the rest of our lives.</p>
<p>Christians of all kinds have been predicting the end of the world forever. Statistically speaking, you're probably going to die normally just like every generation of Christian before you.</p>
<p>I don't think the vaccines are terribly deadly per se, <strong>but</strong> we also have zero long-term data on how people get on with them after a decade or more. We do have plenty of anecdotal data that SOME people have terrible reactions, strokes, death, you name it. And we can't trust the media to do its job and report fairly on these adverse reactions, hold the companies accountable, etc. We're in the "fog of war". The people pushing a single interpretation of events have a lot more money, power, and dedicated employees than we do.</p>
<p>Point being, there is no authority, earthly or Heavenly that can give you black-and-white answers. You, and all of us, are on our own trying to sort out the world around us.</p>

        <p>I am starting to hear about friends and friends of friends have adverse reactions, whether I hear about them in person or on social media. No deaths but hospitalizations and miscarriages, and I feel the media is trying to tell us this is rare. It is NOT rare but VAERS is never up to date and not every adverse reaction gets reported, so how will we ever really know the truth? I hope that makes sense but I agree with others, you can always decide to get the injection later when the trials are over and we have long term safety data. I know it's hard. I'm with you!</p>

        <p>Maybe, I am just going crazy with the whole COVID because it is a joke and it making me irritated and feel crazy when I question  it. I live in Oregon, and I looked up studios in Tennesse and they are booked. It is like there is nowhere to turn. All the red states are being  money hungry cunts and raising the prices.
greed is a big part now. Selfish jerks are price stabbing. In red states you cannot even get a flat.</p>

        <p>i have a feeling, this is just another shift.
not enough people want vaxx? 
let’s tell them, it’s a bio weapon. they will be more willing to take an antidote. Natural virus, which is barely killing anyone is not scary enough.
and oh, on this premise we can start war with China. Bonus!</p>
<p>Just one question pops to mind.
These “scientists” who were studinig this virus so close  and were able to come out with WHACcine so fast.
They couldn’t tell it’s man made?</p>

        <p>No actually he has a point. Vaccine hesitancy is an issue in the states because of the level of misinformation. Most of the emails are complete nonsense and a lot could be completely made up. Bio weapon will scare a large percentage f people into getting the vaccine. So it’s a net benefit</p>

        <p>But why would they release a bioweapon? Isn't it easier to CLAIM there's this new disease, based on common cold virus which is easily found with PCR-test? That test, with enough cycles will find the remains of that virus'  dna from the sample. Also mortality hasn't risen. Isn't that odd? </p>
<p>This is lab-made assumption:
They've created a new virus in lab that makes flu and influenza disappear, matches their symptoms, doesn't affect to total mortality/year, risk a possibility of a whistleblower eventually surfacing and also set themselves in danger of catching the lab-made bug? </p>
<p>Edit: sorry I got confused if you're agreeing with me or not. But i'll leave this here so people can THINK and not go along with this lab-made nonsense.</p>

        <p>What virus? The pcr test is just as useful as a toaster oven when it comes to diagnosis. Why incentivize covid death certificates, and diagnosis? What happened to the flu? Did you see the pandemic on tv, or in the streets? Why create a bio weapon in China, and hope it spread to every corner of earth (in 3 months) when they could just fear monger making healthy people believe they're asymptomatic spreaders (more practical, and efficient), and have people line up for the real bio weapon (problem,  reaction,  solution)? Why lock down so fast, force people to social distance and save people's lives which defeats the entire purpose of a bio weapon? How hard would it be to have 2 puppets on both sides of an argument to distract you? Do you really believe fauci calls shots??? You're really expecting known liars to finally tell you the truth?</p>

        <p>I have a more complex hypothesis.</p>
<p>The virus was a natural virus that had no major transmission due to overwhelming immunity in the community it was resident to.</p>
<p>It was picked up to study by the lab, in process the scientists were exposed then got sick and passed it quickly due to extreme population density.</p>
<p>China, being China, had major influx into the socialized health clinics. It was a major disaster due to <em>drumroll</em> socialism. There wasn't enough supplies and stressed doctors tried everything. Assuming the <em>people dying in the streets</em> videos were accurate, they could be attested to the radical treatments and Chinese folk medicine consumed to fight a chest cold.</p>
<p>The Chinese media promoted a spin that it wasn't Chinese socialist medicine failing, but the virus being extremely bad. It's virulent, no doubt. However it's not particularly deadly on its own.</p>
<p>The Western media and governmental agencies also took China at its word. The elites saw a chance to seize more control.</p>

        <p>Good grief.. Little baby Truthers... Stop fucking believing the new government and media narrative that this FAKE virus was created in China and Fauci was behind it. The email leaks are nothing but bull shit propaganda to get idiots to believe the virus is real and that it was bioengineered.If they get you to accept this narrative, then you’ll believe their BS stories that it mutates and spreads and you’ll believe people are sick and dying. If you start believing that load of crap, slowly they’ll try to get you to take the vaccine.</p>
<p>Wake up fucktards, some of you are getting more stupid and gullible than the vaccinated sheep. Anything that comes out is purposely put out for the narrative they want pushed.</p>
<p>Use common sense, you have seen no one sick, collapsing or dying. There is NO virus</p>
<p>They are getting desperate as more wake up, China &amp; Fauci is their new scape goat.</p>

        <p>Might want to recheck your source on that and the context for accuracy. I literally perform quantitative PCR testing for a living. Many moons ago PCR was only good for qualitative pass/fail identification. It's still used. Clinically, we use quantitative PCR where we count particles in real time using dyes and fluorescent probes. I've seen the misleading article going around that you're referring to. More non-truth to be slurped up and regurgitated by/for the clueless</p>

<p>I don’t think everyone who likes masks is an actual doomer or even a virtue signaler. I think some of them are just insecure about their appearance, have social anxiety or like the anonymity. As long as people don’t try to force me to wear one, I’m completely fine with it if they continue to, just like how I have nothing against Muslim women who choose to cover their hair.</p>

<p>Honestly, I've found the opinions of this sub to be rather consistent. Cognitive dissonance is hanging on the word of TV personalities like Dr Fauci who have flip-flopped on every issue like dying goldfish. But enough toxicity, I'm sick of it. The people on this sub are not your enemy, nor should you consider yourself ours. We're peers who are merely viewing this mess from different perspectives. </p>
<p>What's the expression? It's easier to fool a man than it is to convince him he's been fooled? Well, I'm open to a civil discussion if you are. But ultimately, the sooner everybody realises that it isn't us vs us but us vs <em>them</em>, the better.</p>
