    <strong>Please try to empathize with me</strong>
    <p><p>Please, please try to empathize with me. My uncle died from this disease. Saying it’s fake... that we shouldn’t wear masks... that we should behave normally... how can you guys recommend these things to someone like my aunt? Who is grieving? There are 200,000 people in the United States alone that have families in grieving. Why can’t you see their pain? Do you not think it’s that big of a deal, or do you just not care? </p>
<p>Do you guys smoke in the car with children? Do you refuse to wear your seatbelt? Or put your blinker on before you turn? In what world is the government requiring safety regulations an infringement on your freedoms? These things we do are not for the individual, but are instead for the common good. Because if you walk through a grocery store, and you’re asymptomatic, and you don’t believe in masks, you can kill someone. This disease is highly contagious, and to people like my uncle, is deadly. I just don’t understand, do you truly not care about others or do you refuse to accept facts? </p>
<p>You can keep posting the same articles over and over again, but it won’t change that COVID is real, it’s killing people, and that social distancing and masks both work. And those facts were proven by people much smarter than myself, and smarter than anyone in this sub. Please, think of the people that are dying, if nothing else.</p></p>

        <p>Of course. This has been a terrible year for everyone. I work in retail, and I now have to wear a mask for 40 hours a week. Everything is awful right now. I’ll empathize with those who didn’t get support during this time, if you empathize with people who feel disrespected when people like yourself ignore safety precautions in public and spread this disease even further.</p>

        <p>Glad to see the people in this sub communicate their ideas so well. The ruined lives, deaths, and mayhem have come from our response to the virus, not the virus itself. Idiots such as yourself are why we’re in this situation, and probably will be for another year. So thank you for that.</p>

        <p>Since when am I responsible for other people’s lives? People aren’t even really responsible for them on the road, hence the term “defensive driving”. I’ve been on immunosuppressive medication for my MS for 5 years and it’s always been MY responsibility to stay away from anyone who is sick. I would have never asked others to inconvenience themselves over me. This situation is no different. Those who are vulnerable or scared should take their own precautions. If they’re so concerned, buy a proper mask that protects them no matter what. Someone’s vulnerability should never be someone else’s problem.</p>

        <p>I see. So your logic is to disregard 
safety regulations because you’re not responsible for other’s lives. Fair enough. </p>
<p>So what do you think the solution is, then? Should immune compromised and elderly people completely self isolate until everyone is vaccinated? I’m just curious because I’ve seen several people here condemn the prospect of vaccination. </p>
<p>Also, my uncle was 100% healthy when he dies, as have many other people who have died from COVID. So your argument makes no sense. Why would you not want to avoid deaths that are otherwise unnecessary?</p>

        <p>My son is immunosuppressed. His health is the responsibility of my family and nobody else. Here's what we are doing: washing hands regularly, using sanitizer, staying away from crowds, and staying away from sick people.</p>
<p>Complete self-isolation is cowardly bullshit that we would never force him to do.</p>
<p>It's actually not that difficult - it's about as difficult as tying your shoes every day or wiping your butt when you poop.</p>
<p>&rt;Also, my uncle was 100% healthy when he dies</p>
<p>I doubt that. Age and weight (approx if not known for sure)?</p>

        <p>It’s cowardly bullshit until he gets covid and does not get better. It’s easy to wash hands and stay away from crowds but I’m sure you understand, it only takes one fuck up. I’m sure you also understand that you do not need to be “sick” in order to have covid. Someone could have it and very well show no symptoms. For your son - you should educate yourself. </p>
<p>Also, say his uncle had asthma or was into his early 60s, does that warrant an early death? Are we at the point to where we say 50-60 is an acceptable time to die? Ask yourself why you are attempting to justify/explain the death of his uncle. </p>
<p>If your son died of covid, people like you would say, “well, he was immunosuppressed, it wasn’t the covid”. Good-luck to your son.</p>

        <p>I already answered your question: sure, self-isolate or buy proper PPE. Again, not the rest of the world’s problem. I’m sorry for your loss, I really am. But at what point do we just say, “Enough! Life goes on!”? People die. It’s part of life. A part none of us are getting out of. Whether that’s tomorrow or years down the road. We’re all gonna die. Personally, I’d rather actually LIVE while I can.</p>

        <p>Yeah, no shit it’s your unalienable right. You’re clearly here doing it. Great observation there dude. Let’s get something straight: you want to avoid safety regulations that could prevent deaths that otherwise wouldn’t happen. You are spreading a disease that will kill people before they were supposed to die. That is why you are nihilistic. You do not care about human life. The people you are spreading the disease too might have survived if you wore a mask. </p>
<p>It’s like saying “I’m just going to drive drunk all the time, because someone’s eventually going to get killed by a drunk driver anyway.” It’s stupid, nihilistic, irresponsible, and it shows a blatant disregard for the sanctity of life. </p>
<p>You can do all the mental gymnastics you want. But you will always have to deal with the fact that you don’t give a shit about anyone besides yourself.</p>

        <p>Lol... sweetheart. That's cute. It seems like you're implying you won't take the vaccine. Also very cute. I'm not surprised to see that your detachment from reality is uniform, honestly. LIVING life... again, cute. If you think that wearing a mask and not attending large parties is "locking people up", then you have never dealt with serious hardship before. </p>
<p>Honestly, you're right. My side won. Government's around the world are taking the virus seriously. Biden and others will come into office, and will impose tighter regulations. Hopefully they will impose fines for not wearing a mask. Hopefully, in the future, you will not be able to go to work or put your kids in school without proper vaccination. Hopefully, as time progresses, you will find that the society around you is forcing you to behave in a way that doesn't harm your fellow citizens. Here's hoping, I guess. </p>

        <p>That’s not true. I have seen multiple people on this sub claim it isn’t true, and they have also frequented subs that promoted the COVID hoax conspiracy. While it might not be the point of this specific sub, there are 100% people here that think it’s a hoax. </p>

<p>There's certainly a surge in cases alright...Was just over in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspriacy/">r/conspriacy</a> and just shuddered at the amount of people saying they have or know someone with COVID...The pandemic is spreading but not the viral one, the pandemic of the mind is infecting everyone....</p>

<p>If there was a real danger no one would need to impose restrictions on us cause everything would be very clear how bad it is and everyone would want to keep safe regardless. However as someone who still doesn’t even know a single person who had covid, I refuse to be doing anything and don’t think there is a danger. Most people don’t even know it they, they feel it but they are too cowardish to speak up and want to play heros</p>
<p>Same link as above.</p>
<p>I looked for about five minutes for examples. I will agree that the vast majority of people in this sub come with a very different set of ideologies, and 99% of you guys are not implying that it is a hoax. However, the very same ideas I see being spewed here are said by others who believe COVID to be fake, so while I do admit to some degree of generalization, I still very much believe that you are sharing the same space as those that are deniers. </p>
<p>Honestly, though, I don't see any detriment to my claim. I am going to treat this sub, full of self-perceived freedom champions and anti globalists, the same as I would deniers; people who are actively promoting the spread of a disease that is killing people.</p>

        <p>Unless you've been masking, social distancing and locking yourself in your home every flu season in years past, you may have inadvertently killed not only a grandma/grandpa, but maybe even a child because the flu is more deadly to children than covid. So if you can honestly tell me you've never been in contact with someone while you had a cold or flu, never went to work while feeling sick and toughed it out, spent every past winter locked in your home alone... then you're a hypocrite, a virtue signaler and a liar. You don't need a scientist to tell you that your logic is extremely flawed and/or non-existent.</p>

        <p>Taking a precaution to avoid a risk is about probability, not perfection. If I wear my mask 9/10 times I go to the grocery store, I am spreading the virus 90% less than someone like yourself, who is taking zero precautions. I wear my mask every time I leave my house, but that’s besides the point. </p>
<p>Comparing COVID to the flu is a straw man’s argument. COVID is more contagious and has a higher death count than the flu. Also, have you ever noticed that when you were in school, and you got the flu, you stayed home? Do you know what a sick day is? It’s so that you don’t spread your sickness to other people. Gotta have that freedom though, I guess. </p>
<p>I’m glad you think I’m a liar. You clearly don’t understand science, so your insult is a huge compliment.</p>

        <p>It's called straw man not straw man's, professor genius.</p>
<p>And yes, I can compare it to the flu because they're both viruses with similar mortality rates - there's nothing to stop me comparing it to the flu actually. You can check that the infection fatality rate (probably a term you don't even understand) is actually 50% LOWER than the flu's for people under 70 on the WHO's own website if you don't believe me: https://www.who.int/bulletin/online_first/BLT.20.265892.pdf</p>
<p>But I doubt you'll even be able to understand what it says because they have yet to cover it in your high school biology class and it doesn't have any catchy hashtags or slogans to regurgitate while taking selfies with a mask on.</p>

        <p>Ah, damn, I guess my typo invalidates my entire argument. So, now that we've established that  I'm a high school student who only gets research from instagram and "catchy hashtags", let's just look at basic facts. </p>
<p>First of all, I don't know where you got that link, but it doesn't work, so good job. Maybe you should learn how to copy and paste a bit better. </p>
<p>Second of all, lets take a look at those infection fatality rates. Maybe my eyes are lying to me, because I'm seeing completely different numbers than you. According to Mayo Clinic, 9.9 million people have gotten COVID-19 in 2020 in the U.S. Of that 9.9 million people, 230,000 have died, leaving us with an infection fatality rate of 2.32%. Now, let's look at the super crazy deadly flu that you keep talking about. 38,000,000 million cases in 2020 in the U.S. Wait... what's this? There's only 22,000 deaths? I thought you said there'd be more? Weird, that leaves us with a much smaller 0.057 infection fatality rate. </p>
<p>You can try to argue the logistics of counting COVID-19 cases versus the flue (because COVID cases are counted whereas the flu is estimated), but really, you can add an additional 100,000 cases to the overall flu count and it would still be significantly less. </p>
<p>Good try though. </p>

        <p>I can sympathize from a human perspective. But what’s happened is happened. Most people who’ve died of Covid were on their way out the door as is and Covid just shoved them through rather than let them stroll through. The dead are dead, they don’t worry about being dead or have to deal with life anymore. It’s the living who suffer after all is said and done.</p>
<p>You’re responsible for your own life and choose how you deal with outside choices from those around you. We may be all the same race, but we’re not a collective. Some societies are, but not all. </p>
<p>Just like here- We all don’t agree on everything. Some of us are more lax in our views, some are more extreme. We though as a majority stand against letting things get out of control and stand against “The new normal.” We’d rather live in dangerous freedom rather than safe slavery. The government has proven time and time against its not there for the benefit of the people. They can say it as much as they want. But ask any group through history who’s been oppressed “If it’s for the greater good.”</p>
<p>The old Native American saying goes. “You can trust the government, just ask a native.”</p>
<p>I personally believe in the constitution and the saying. “Give me liberty, or give me death.” And nowhere in the constitution does it say “Unless there’s a pandemic.” It stands at all times, and I will not give up my freedoms so others can feel safe. </p>
<p>I’m sorry about your uncle. But that’s the way things are.</p>

        <p>I find it hilarious that people are championing anti masking in the name of freedom. To imply that your freedoms are being eroded because the government and businesses are mandating masks due to a pandemic is an insult to the people in this world who actually are oppressed. You know, totalitarian regimes, far right theocracies, or maybe the literal slaves that are still in this world. I’m glad to see that you and people in this sub are content in being apathetic towards the deaths of others. You’re probably dealing with this issue much better than those who have had loved ones die, or people that they’re worried about. </p>
<p>To be honest, you seem discontent with life as a whole. “It’s the living who suffer after all is said and done”. I don’t want to be condescending, but your disregard for human life may be a reflection in some other aspects of your life you need to sort out. In the meantime, your endangering the lives of others who actually want to continue living. </p>
<p>Thank you for your condolences regarding my otherwise healthy uncle dying. Even though you dismiss other people’s deaths as “the way things are”, I can still accept that at face value.</p>

        <p>I personally am fine with mask. It’s the shutdowns and restrictiveness of the government that I’m against. It never starts large, nor is it like a switch where one day it’s nazi Germany. It’s a slow build of slowly erasing freedoms and taking more and more till it becomes “normal.” </p>
<p>The boiling frog theory if you will. You drop a frog in a hot pot of water it will know danger instinctively and jump right out. But you set it in comfortable water and slowly turn up the temperature to where it gets hotter and hotter eventually it will boil alive without realizing it. </p>
<p>Like I said earlier. We here all have our own different views, but we all agree on the overall theme of the end game and not accepting the government doing what it wants. </p>
<p>You are right that there are still totalitarian  regimes and slavery in this world. That’s a fact just as well. And that’s why we have subs like this. Because that PROVES that it could, and can still happen.</p>
<p>I’ve lost people due to various things in my life. We all have. It’s part of life, death is as natural as being born. Was I sad when they happened? Of course I was. Did the world stop spinning? No, life went on. And wether I chose to accept that it happened or not. It happened and nothing can or will change that fact. </p>
<p>I enjoy life, I really do. And that’s why I’m here. Because I don’t want life to turn to shit because others are afraid and want to live on their knees. If you want to live such a way, by all means please do. That is completely your choice. And it’s my choice how I live my life. </p>
<p>I don’t know you, nor do I know your uncle. He could have been on deaths door for all I know. He could have been healthy as an ox and was one of the few unfortunate victims who died solely due to Covid. I won’t deny that it does happen. But someone on the internet saying one thing can’t be proven true. I could say I’m Taylor swift on a burner account to look normal and voice my real opinions cause I don’t want to be canceled. That doesn’t mean I’m really Taylor swift or anyone else. It means I can say one thing and unless there’s 100% undeniable proof, the internet is unreliable for someone saying something.</p>

        <p>I agree that we should take anecdotes out of the equation, especially as these conversations evolve into ones with more nuance. You don't know for sure that my uncle died, just as I don't know that you truly believe the things that you're saying. But I'll respond as if you do. </p>
<p>The slippery slope argument is one that I find to be genuinely interesting, particularly in regards to American culture. Will wearing masks devolve our government into a fascist state? I have a few responses to that.</p>
<p>First of all, you gave me nothing to work in terms of specifications. <em>How</em> does wearing a mask contribute to the slope? Merely based on suggestion? Are you saying that because us sheep are wearing masks because the government told us to, we will be more susceptible to increasingly restricting demands? Now, I want to avoid using a strong man argument, but there's just so many examples of laws in America that restricted your freedoms before COVID took place. You can't drive drunk, you can't open a business in your place of residence (in some places), etc. etc. Virtually all laws restrict your freedom in some way. That's the point; to prevent people from doing things that are dangerous to others or society as a whole. </p>
<p>I do, surprisingly, believe that America is working towards a more controlled and unconstitutional state. The Patriot Act, the digital surveillance state, and President Trump's dismissal of the Enoluments Clause all come to mind. However, all COVID-19 restrictions are doing are limiting your freedoms insomuch as you will be <em>harming other people.</em> They are mandates that are directly recommended by the top scientists in their field, who have unanimously found that these mandates help slow the curve. </p>
<p>As far as your continued apathy towards human life, that's fine, I really can't argue with that. Im glad you enjoy your life. Other people, including the elderly and those with bad immune systems, enjoy their lives as well. I hope that one day you can value other people's lives as much as you value your own, even if it requires a minor inconvenience to you. And that's what wearing a mask is. A minor inconvenience. </p>
<p>"Death is a part of life". You are right, and I agree. However, is a premature death not a travesty to the very concept of life itself? If you cause the death of an innocent person in the name of freedom, are you not taking away their freedom to live?</p>

        <p>Thank you for your concise disregard of my comment. My point should be pretty clear, which is that putting a mask on your face is not a civil liberties violation. Upon signing your social contract at birth, you are not afforded the liberty to harm your fellow citizen. This is why violence, theft, murder, and smoking indoors are all illegal.</p>
<p>A restriction of certain actions by a government is one of the very foundations of a government; it is a collection of laws put in place to limit the potentially dangerous instincts of its people. It is to remove us from the state of nature into a state of law and order, where we can walk down the street without fearing for our physical safety. </p>
<p>You may perceive masks as an infringement on your freedom, but you are wrong. I keep using this point in this thread, because I think it solidifies where your logic runs short: do you think it is a civil liberties violation that you are not allowed to drive drunk? Are you upset that you can't smoke a cigarette in a car with a child? The answer, if you're even halfway sane, would be no to both questions. Which is why you should put your mask on. You know, to protect other people.</p>
