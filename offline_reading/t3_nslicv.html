<li>Spike protein was the weapon, virus was the carrier</li>
<li>Vaccine makes your own body make the weapon instead of relying on a flimsy, fragile carrier which has so many epitopes for our marvellous immune system to make robust antibodies to. </li>
<li>Vaccine forces you to make inferior antibodies that can be evaded by small tweaks of the spike protein that can make future infections lethal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Trust the experts. The people who lied to you constantly for over a year now tells you it is safe, coerces you, gives you donuts, beer and million dollar lotteries to take it. Sure, it all sounds very safe and above board to me.</p>

        <p>A spike protein is a mechanism the virus uses to attach to a cell, and then it subsequently merges itself with the cell wall, depositing its payload into the cell. Right?</p>
<p>It might be fair to say that the spike protein is the weapon <em>of the virus</em>, but it's not clear to me how a spike protein on its own, without a virus, is a problem.</p>

        <p>&rt; <strong>Alone</strong> the spike protein allows for the injection of vital RNA into the host cell.</p>
<p>Alone?</p>
<p>Have you seen this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xuc9D4LVJdg</p>
<p>It is <strong>not true</strong> that a spike protein does it "alone"</p>
<p>A spike protein <em>attached to an "envelope"</em> allows the contents of that "envelope" to be deposited into the cell. It does this by merging the envelope with the cell wall. The combination of an envelope and spike proteins has a name ...it's called a virus.</p>
<p>So yes, spike proteins allow <em>a virus</em> to inject RNA into a host cell. No, spike proteins alone do not accomplish this.</p>
<p>If your body is producing spike proteins attached to envelops containing RNA ...then your body is producing viruses. We wouldn't phrase that situation as, "you're shedding spike proteins" we'd phrase it as, "your body is producing viruses"</p>
<p>But people aren't claiming that a vaxed person is producing viruses. The claim is that the they're producing spike proteins alone. So I'll repeat my question, now that you hopefully understand the situation better: why would producing spike proteins all alone without them being attached to an envelope, be a problem?</p>

        <p>idk dude, I read through at least the ICAN emails, a lot of the stuff people are posting about them is bullshit.</p>
<p>1) He NEVER said HCQ works, full stop. He was asked about it several times and said there's no RCT.</p>
<p>2) He said masks don't work, but he also PUBLICLY said that and then changed his mind. It'd be one thing if he said they don't work privately while encouraging them publicly, but he didn't.</p>
<p>3) Same thing with asymptomatic spread, he publicly said asymptomatic spread has never been a driver of pandemics.</p>
<p>Posting and defending these boomer level facebook memes really does make us look stupid. And you can look through my comment history and see I'm no shill.</p>

        <p>Yeah I post there too and frequently get down voted for calling out the vaccine agenda. I just try to promote this sub, we have more users and I think everyone needs to come around to the more "extreme" viewpoints if they're really going to save themselves.

        <p>My biggest issue with the vaccine being a bioweapon of sorts is that the whole idea would be somewhat poorly formulated. </p>
<p>The biggest problem to an authoritarian government or body is people who aren't obedient. The problem is, the people who are taking the vaccine are the most obedient of our society. Why would they want to take out their best people? </p>
<p>Ideally, all of us NOT taking the vaccine would be the ones being killed or sterilized.</p>

        <p>Definitely an interesting thought experiment . If that was the case I don't think we'd see them pushing the injection so hard. If depopulation is the goal, offing a minority of people would barely make a dent. As well there are a lot of smart / powerful people that are keeping quiet but definitely not taking the injection. The rest of this minority are critical thinkers, spiritual folk, people who have faith in their own immune system, and young children. If they kill all of those people off they'd be left with their very own idiocracy and society would slowly crumble. I can't imagine the eugenicists at the top would want the average vaxed person to be a part of their new society.</p>
<p>The reality is that people think life is going back to normal, but have seemingly forgotten the Build Back Better mantra that was being propagated by politicians and the elite in 2020. Society hasn't shifted at all, and their intentions haven't been met. So I can't see this being anywhere close to over.</p>

        <p>Global population reduction is the goal. It’s a lot of work to take out 8 billion people. If you could get 70% of them to take themselves out, then the authoritarian regime could come down hard on the free thinkers.</p>

        <p>But if all that is left is free thinkers, who will do their dirty work for them? </p>
<p>No, something else is at play. Something we all don't understand yet. I'm not sure myself even.</p>

        <p>I’d agree with you. We are missing a few key details still. Maybe the vaccine is nothing more than a division tactic. Maybe it’s all just a compliance test or a distraction from food and fuel shortages</p>

        <p>Unpopular opinion here, keep in mind I’m just spit balling but what if there is something much bigger at play here ; I was never a spiritual person until a few years ago when I had a strange mystical experience that changed my life, showed me what all these spiritual teachers/religious people are talking about.</p>
<p>What if the truth is much darker? (I don’t even know how to articulate this thought so bare with me ) what if this an to fully disconnecting us from “spirit”</p>
<p>There have been plenty of prophecies, from many sources, all spoken and explained in their own way. They all seem somewhat similar; some huge change is coming in the universe ; something that will change reality as we know it in a matter of minutes/hours -  they quite  literally could be “coming for our soul” so we end up right there with them, since their “time is up” 
-Terence McKenna - we are the transition generation
- cia program / through the looking glass “they know it’s coming, they can not stop it all they can do is delay it”
- the standard biblical notion - the ‘coming of god’</p>
<p>Bare in mind, the relationship most people have with this language (which is really the bottle next in this thought) causes this repulsive feeling in those who haven’t had this strange spiritual experience.. </p>
<p>But the truth is, we know NOTHING about our relationship with the universe.. chances are what’s happening is SIGNIFICANTLY bigger than we can comprehend because we don’t know how to “see” we don’t know why we’re here or what we are really suppose to be doing. The people doing all this crap are the same people who control our education, set up the norms in society / trends, fads, interests hobbies/ stereotypical ideas, thoughts, decision- they control every inch of   What we think of as “reality” the creators of the metaphorical matrix </p>
<p>Everything in this society / reality is an illusion, INCLUDING our notions on life - the soul is a really dimensions of our being, something we as westerners have been disconnected from (not fully until now)- on purpose most likely. I was not someone who bought into this ideas but something is definitely going on here. Something much bigger than what we think we know. I realize this sounds bonkers to most but truth is stranger than fiction..</p>
