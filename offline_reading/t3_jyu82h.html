    <strong>CDC Issues New Study Supporting Effectiveness of Mask Mandate... There's just a few problems...</strong>
    <p><p>https://preview.redd.it/jrjk82pd1s061.jpg?width=635&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46b3c5358734d9deccdad241293bdadcd8c9a392</p>
<p>I  was initially surprised by the   headline and infographic, so I clicked  through to read the study on the   CDC website. Any reasonable person  would conclude from either the   headline or infographic, that a mask  mandate would cause a slight   decrease(6%) in spread, and that the lack  of such a mandate would   result in a doubling(100% increase). The way the  headline and   infographic are reported is misleading in my opinion.</p>
<p>Both are referring to these numbers:</p>
<p>"After    the governor’s executive order, COVID-19 incidence (calculated as   the   7-day rolling average number of new daily cases per 100,000    population)  decreased (mean decrease of 0.08 cases per 100,000 per day;    net  decrease of 6%) among counties with a mask mandate (mandated    counties)  but continued to increase (mean increase of 0.11 cases per    100,000 per  day; net increase of 100%) among counties without a mask    mandate  (nonmandated counties)."</p>
<p>The    average number of new daily cases per 100,000 population decreased by    0.08, in counties with a mask mandate and increased by 0.11 per  100,000   population in counties without a mandate. Hardly headline  worthy.</p>
<p>"   During June 1–7, 2020,  the 7-day rolling average of daily COVID-19    incidence among counties  that ultimately had a mask mandate was three    cases per 100,000, and  among counties that did not, was four per 100,000   "</p>
<p>So this huge impact that mask mandates are supposed to have is one more person testing positive per 100,000?</p>
<p>"     By the week of the governor’s executive order requiring masks (July     3–9), COVID-19 incidence had increased 467% to 17 per 100,000 in     mandated counties and 50% to six per 100,000 among nonmandated counties.     By August 17–23, 2020, the 7-day rolling average COVID-19 incidence    had  decreased by 6% to 16 cases per 100,000 among mandated counties  and    increased by 100% to 12 per 100,000 among nonmandated counties. "</p>
<p>If    the mask mandate is so effective, as seems to be the conclusion of   this  article, why did the counties without the mandate only have an   average  incidence of 12 per 100,000 while the counties where masks were   mandated  the average incidence was 16 per 100,000.</p>
<p>I'm    not a scientist, but I would really love a professional explanation  of   the publicized interpretation of this article. I've shown it to  some  of  my friends and they seem equally confused. In it's current  form, I  feel  that this article and the way it is framed is misleading.</p></p>

        <p>It is misleading at best... false is what I would personally call it. They should have given the number of cases in places with mask mandates and without right in that infographic.</p>
<p>Going from 3 cases to 4 in places without a mask mandate means that basically masks do nothing to prevent spread and there are numerous other things that could take credit or blame for that small of a difference.</p>

<p>Wow what an absolutely terrible study for the CDC to use. Shame on them for using a study such as this to manipulate people. They took numbers without showing the full picture to people. Absolutely misleading.</p>

        <p>That's my impression as well, I'm hoping someone will explain to me the actual science that demonstrates the effectiveness of government mandates on the spread of the virus.</p>

        <p>We also have to keep in mind whether the counties with mask mandates had stricter lockdowns. If more people are being forced to stay inside, of course there’s going to be less spread. But as soon as things open, cases are going to increase either way.</p>
