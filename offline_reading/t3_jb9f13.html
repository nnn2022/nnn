    <strong>Frustrated with my friend right now...</strong>
    <p><p>My friend just lamented to me, “I wonder when they’re going to open dance events again. It’s gonna be a long time.”</p>
<p>I responded, “you have some control over that. You can lobby them to reopen.” He said, “but they’re closed for a good reason.”</p>
<p>I replied, “just don’t let them take away everything you love.” He said, “I can’t not let them. It’s up to them when to reopen.”</p>
<p>No, it’s really not.</p>
<p>I told him his defeatist attitude was pathetic. Suggestions welcome for how better to get through to him. He’s so caught up in blaming the Trump administration for this that he won’t direct any of his frustration towards actually enjoying his life again.</p>
<p>I feel so sad for him.</p></p>

        <p>The lockdowns would end if everyone just stopped going along with them, if every business opened they couldn’t be shut down, if everyone stopped wearing masks they couldn’t enforce mask mandates but were waiting on lifelong politicians who corrupt their own states to know how to properly navigate a pandemic and get the economy going again.</p>

        <p>Not to get all morally superior sounding here, but it's just a symptom of the long term abandonment of personal responsibility.  A couple of generations now have been conditioned to not fix problems, but to get government to fix them.  As a trivial example you can't just fix a broken sidewalk, you have to petition your local town to come out and fix it,  you don't talk to your neighbor if they are having a large noisy party, you call the police to come talk to them.</p>
<p>Now we are at the point where people can't decide whether to object to a policy until the government tells them what their opinion should be.</p>
