    <strong>I hate it when people compare fictional viruses to real ones</strong>
    <p><p>TLDR: It's completely asinine to compare a fictional disease with a 99% death rate to a real disease with a 99% survival rate.</p>
<p>I was browsing through Youtube today when I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6YOZkNSLkM">this</a> video. Never watched this channel before but I do love the "28" series so I figured it was worth a watch.</p>
<p>But then he started talking about how "Britain was opened too quickly" and "the government was wanting to get back to normal without completely eradicating the virus." If it was possible to <em>hear</em> a wink that would be it. </p>
<p>This is now the second video I've seen that compared the Rage Virus to COVID and frankly it really aggravates me to hear the two compared.</p>
<p>The Rage Virus is usually cited as one of the most terrifying fictional diseases and with good reason. The people it infects come to merely exist to infect others. They do not eat, drink, sleep or tire. Their sole goal in life from infection until they starve to death is to infect you.</p>
<p>In the sequel, it is revealed that some are "immune" to the virus in that they do not exhibit symptoms, but they are still carriers to the virus. The virus is spread through bodily fluids (blood, saliva). I do not believe there is an example of the virus ever leaving the body, so even if you are lucky enough to be immune, you can say goodbye to ever being intimate with a loved one ever again. </p>
<p>The Rage Virus is every bit of the "we be fucked" disease that the doomers believe Corona to be, but to act like the two are remotely similar is abhorrent.</p></p>

        <p>The rage virus sounds like it's based off rabies. But to compare that with Covid is beyond idiotic.</p>

        <p>Some of these people live in a fictional world where they think this is an apocalypse scenario. That’s why putting people in quarantine camps, harsh penalties for not social distancing, etc are justified to them. </p>
<p>Nobody ever writes a book/movie about a virus with a 99.6% recovery rate where 80% or more have mild to no symptoms...because that would be boring.</p>

        <p>I believe Steven King created a 99% death virus that spread like Covid (haven’t actually read the book).  If Covid was really like that, we’d surely be dead by now.</p>

        <p>You’re talking about The Stand, right? A great book about what could <em>actually</em> happen during a life-threatening pandemic. A Doomer would not last. </p>
<p>I wish I knew what Stephen King thought about all of this. It’d be interesting to hear.</p>

        <p>He’s talked about it on Twitter. He knows this isn’t anything close to Captain Tripps, but it seems his Trump hate is kind of clouding his views. Mostly everything he puts on Twitter is how much he hates the president. He seems to be a pro-masker, this is all Trump’s fault, which is a bit of simplification</p>

<p>If they're implying that's justification to isolate and punish people who are asymptomatic with the coronavirus, then they'd best be prepared to isolate and punish AIDS patients for engaging in relations with others and potentially spreading the virus.</p>
<p>You know, that thing that California had just lowered from a felony to a misdemeanor in the beginning of the pandemic.</p>
<p>That thing that these assholes would protest up and down, left and right if it actually became a thing.</p>
