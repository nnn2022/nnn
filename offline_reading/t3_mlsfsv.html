    <strong>Bridging the gap</strong>
    <p><p>Hello, burner account here since this may get downvoted to hell. What I wanna do is learn about all of this. Before I get into debates and stuff, I’m gonna say this: I am pro mask, and I disagree with most everything here, however even though we have these differing opinions I want to have a respectful conversation and learn some things. This may sound preachy or whatever but I don’t care as long as I get some interaction out of this community. Some questions I’d like to first ask are:</p>
<p>1) what/who turned you to this side of the argument? Why are your opinions the way they are now? Where do you get your information from primarily? </p>
<p>2) what is your opinion of the other side? Why do you feel that way?</p>
<p>3) why do you have doubts about the current consensus among the scientific community about this pandemic?</p>
<p>4) I’m gonna list off some general arguments against what this forum stands for, and I just want whatever response you care to give.</p>
<p>4.1) how are mask mandates anywhere near fascism/tyrrany? What rights are being obstructed?</p>
<p>4.2) why NOT wear a mask? If you are right, and masks are ineffective then you were slightly inconvenienced. If you are wrong, and masks are effective at preventing transmission, then not wearing masks could cost the lives of the elderly/ people with medical conditions that make them vulnerable.</p>
<p>4.3) what place do you have, presumably not having studied covid or medical related subjects in university, calling BS on the worlds leading doctors?</p>
<p>4.4) clearly masks don’t cause trouble breathing as medical professionals can wear them for hours on end with no drop in o2 saturation when measured with a pulse ox. Your response? </p>
<p>4.5) with so many vaccinated, and not that many serious injuries caused directly from the vaccine, why do you not trust it? Why do you oppose vaccine passports?</p>
<p>5) at the beginning of the pandemic, were you scared of covid and it’s potential effects? </p>
<p>6) putting yourself in an echo chamber of people who only agree with you is usually considered unhealthy. Do you browse generally pro-new-normal subreddits/forums?</p>
<p>7) yes, I read the pinned post and know you guys aren’t necessarily anti mask</p>
<p>8) again, I do not intend on creating a hostile environment, if you think I’m being a dick, call me out, throw words catch words yunno?</p>
<p>Alright cool you can comment now</p></p>

        <p>I’m not anti mask. Nor am I anti Covid vaccine. Oh, and I don’t try to pretend I’m an expert on anything.  </p>
<p>I know Covid is real, and can be harmful and deadly. But I also know there are people in our world population who in fact shouldn’t or can’t wear masks. Right off the top of my head, based off current CDC web page reading it includes; folks with COPD, PTSD, claustrophobia, high anxiety, Autism, Sensory disorders, and hearing impairments. So your argument that people in the medical community have worn masks without issue for decades is ignoring the simple truth that the many folks with the before mentioned medical conditions would likely not be pursuing career fields where masks are required. Present day pandemic mandates makes that option now an impossibility. Our American Disabilities Act was created to protect folks for this exact reason. </p>
<p>The same logic can be applied to vaccine passports. Yes, many of us choose to opt out of the vaccine medical trial  because we want to wait until the trial is complete, the data is collected, peer reviewed and given full FDA approval . But many of us don’t even have the choice to be part of the vaccine trials because of unique medical situations. These same people will now be further stigmatized socially, economically, educationally, etc. simply because medically the reward of the vaccine does not outweigh the risk for them. Life is already hard on the medically marginalized, and something like a vaccine passport will only make it harder. And that stinks of ableism.</p>

        <p>1:  John Locke, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson. Freedom is paramount. I get my information from a wide variety of sources but primarily government agency publications as they are focused exclusively on facts and statistics. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I don’t see us as “sides”. We are one group with differing opinions. That is okay, we are allowed to disagree so long as we do so cordially. I feel that way because my rights and your rights are the same. Where yours end, mine end as well. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I agree with the science. What I disagree with is the violations of rights and civil liberties. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speed round let’s go!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>4.1. Violates the First Amendment. Easy one. </p>
<p>4.2. Wear a mask if you want to. Don’t wear one of you don’t. It’s none of anyone else’s business. </p>
<p>4.3. As aforementioned I don’t disagree with science. I disagree with constitutional violations. My education is two masters degrees. One is homeland security and one in emergency management. My bachelors is in criminal justice specializing is law enforcement tactics. I have several years experience policing in a major US city. I understand the intricacies of the law and constitution to a degree many will never even scratch the surface of unless they work in the courts. </p>
<p>4.4. That’s fine, if they choose to wear them than that is great. But time and place is everything. </p>
<p>4.5. Get a vaccine if you want. Don’t get one if you don’t. Part two, Violation of the 14th Amendment. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Wasn’t a major concern for me. I deal with people facing far worse contagious diseases on a daily basis. But that didn’t stop me from looking into it. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I brows everything from this and 4chan all the way to far lefty subs and read left as well as right wing publications. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agreed. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t think you’re being a dick. If you have any other questions or curiosities please reach out. I’m fully aware that my outlook on life does not constitute everyone on here, but it does represent my stances and I’m open for communication.</p>

<li>World Dream cruise liner had &rt;6,900 passengers who were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 for two weeks on a super-spreader ship between 3rd week of Jan 2020 and 1st week of Feb 2020. ZERO died. I never believed the narrative from the very beginning.</li>
<li>I get all of my data from the EMA, FDA, CDC, national government statistics in France, Germany, Belgium, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, the US, Japan and Austria. I also get data from peer-reviewed articles that are NOT based on models that cannot be reproduced. I do NOT get my 'information' from the news because those reporting the news are not scientifically-inclined and cannot understand the data provided by primary sources.</li>
<li>The 'other side' consists of hypochondriac fascists whose reasoning are based on emotional arguments, appeals to authority and strawman arguments. They are also woefully illiterate because they can never debate using data. They are also unable to observe with their own eyes that all the doom predictions never happened. They are also BlueAnon because they literally believe that DeSantis is feeding bodies to alligators and/or hiding them in the 'Glades to lower numbers.</li>
<li>There is NO current consensus - there is only synthetic consensus with the ExPeRtS who are allowed to be given airtime. All experts who oppose the narrative - who actually outnumber the TV doctors and scientists - are systematically blocked from social media and are NEVER invited for debates in which they are forced to defend their positions. When you block scientific debate, you are engaging in scientism instead of science. That alone is a HUGE red flag that something truly evil is happening.</li>
<li>It's just 2 weeks to flatten the curve &rt;&rt; It's just X months to flatten the curve &rt;&rt; It's just a mask &rt;&rt; It's just until we get a vaxx &rt;&rt; It's just until we reach 60% vaxx rates &rt;&rt; It's just a vaxx passport&rt;&rt; It's just until we reach 70% vaxx rates &rt;&rt; It's just until we reach 80% vaxx rates&rt;&rt;It's just a digital ID&rt;&rt;  It's just until we reach 90% vaxx rates &rt;&rt; It's just until we reach 100% vaxx rates  Do you see why we have problems with this? It just never ends!!!</li>
<li>We are not wrong on masks being utterly useless and we have 101 years' worth of evidence to back this up. The CDC used mannequins to 'prove' that double masks are effective - this is the pseudo-science that the C19 debacle has devolved into. Feel free to request articles stretching all the way back from 1919.</li>
<li>People with medical backgrounds are not qualified to comment on topics related to virology and epidemiology. <strong><em>How can you still make this basic mistake in April 2021???</em></strong> This is why the ExPeRtS on TV are always medical doctors instead of virologists and epidemiologists. Also, an appeal to authority is not a scientific process.</li>
<li>When, prior to 2020, did you see a doctor wear a mask for hours on end outside of surgery? When you can find a single instance, feel free to circle back to us.</li>
<li>There are few vaxx injuries despite high vaxx rates just as there are few deaths compared to infections. Why do you not apply your vaxx logic to C19? (Do you see why I say that the 'other side' lacks basic critical thinking skills???(</li>
<li>I was never afraid of C19.</li>
<li>I don't have time for Doomer subs, but I do spend hours every week debunking dodgy peer-reviewed articles that use projections based on modelling. It's better to deal with people who are experts than emotionally incontinent people who simply regurgitate MSM talking points.</li>
<li>You are polite, which is why many people will engage with you.</li>
