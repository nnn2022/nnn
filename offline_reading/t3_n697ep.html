        <p>We are about 30 percent who have received the vaccine who are eligible, anyone 16yo and up in the US.</p>
<p>Vaccine injections have dropped by 20% as of last week and are in decline.</p>
<p>Basically those who are willing to go out of their way and had a lot of intention to get it, already got it </p>
<p>Whats to be seen is how many people left who will get it when it's super convenient, how many people will refuse, and how many of the later whose minds can be changed with the ever increasing propaganda and social pressure.</p>
<p>There isnt a celebrity alive or government propaganda campaign that will get me to decide that getting an experimental vaccine that skipped animal trials, had a rushed single phase human trial, that made it to market in less than a year, that is brought to us by the same industry that gave us the opiod epidemic, knowingly sold HIV infected blood to Asia and Latin America, pays hundreds of millions to billions every year for damages for injury and death caused by their products (Phizer being the largest single payout in history at 2.3 billion) and who are frequently in court for falsifying, destroying, and or altering clinical trail data </p>
<p>It amazes me that hundreds of millions of people world wide volunteered to be the animal in the animal trials</p>

        <p>We'll see. At least in the US they can't force it in Texas and Florida any time soon. They'll try to force people to get it to get a job or go to college, but the first court cases have already been launched and it'll come down to the courts to have the last say, not a "vaccinate first, vaccinate later, vaccinate some more, then when everyone is dead try to ask a question or two" government attitude.</p>
<p>Travel can become very hard as most borders have the right to deny entry to non-locals for whatever reason they like, so be it.</p>
