        <p>Yeah.  I remember having the same eureka last year when the CDC started putting out data in May/June 2020.</p>
<p>The risk of death from COVID is not higher than influenza except for individuals over 65.  So basically everyone I interact with is at lower risk from COVID than from the flu.  In 2019 no one I interacted with considered the flu to be on their list of top 10 things to worry about.  </p>
<p>In 2021, most people I interact with are convinced that COVID is their # 1 thing to worry about.</p>
