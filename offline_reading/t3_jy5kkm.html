        <p>Now someone HAS to do a study debunking that masks protect “others” from the wearer. That’s what all these asinine mandates hinge on.</p>

        <p>Would be hard to design given that the claim is that they apparently only work when everyone wears them, but here’s some lab stuff (published in scientific reports, but still):</p>
<p>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72798-7</p>
<p>&rt; Surprisingly, wearing an unwashed single layer t-shirt (U-SL-T) mask while breathing yielded a significant increase in measured particle emission rates compared to no mask, increasing to a median of 0.61 particles/s. The rates for some participants (F1 and F4) exceeded 1 particle/s, representing a 384% increase from the median no-mask value. Wearing a double-layer cotton t-shirt (U-DL-T) mask had no statistically significant effect on the particle emission rate, with comparable median and range to that observed with no mask.</p>

        <p>Yep: Unless you are known infectious... no mask does anything and when you are infectious, it is meant to keep you from coughing or sneezing on someone.</p>
<p>Airborne viruses? Masks have never done anything for those because no masks fit tight enough to filter out those viruses.</p>

        <p>&rt;when you are infectious, it is meant to keep you from coughing or sneezing on someone.</p>
<p>You're right. Sadly, most people are generally asymptomatic for a period at the start of the infection but still able to spread covid. That's why everyone it is really important everyone wears a mask.</p>

        <p>Here is the CDC advice from yesterday saying everyone needs to wear masks and it's </p>
<p>&rt;especially relevant for asymptomatic or presymptomatic infected wearers who feel well and may be unaware of their infectiousness to others, and who are estimated to account for more than 50% of transmissions.</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/masking-science-sars-cov2.html</p>
<p>And here's a Nature article discussing a meta analysis of covid studies. The gist is that the impact isn't fully understood but that it's thought 17% of cases are asymptomatic and they have have 42% less chance of passing on the infection (importantly not zero).</p>
<p>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03141-3</p>
<p>The consensus of the scientific community is to wear a mask because it's the intelligent thing to do given the information we have.</p>

        <p>So, fauci is not part of the scientific community? Cool.</p>
<p>Consensus really isn't how science works. There isn't any evidence that the asymptomatic portion is that small, nor that they represent a significant portion of the spread. The quantity of virus present is much, much smaller in a person who hasn't (yet?) shown an immune response (because that's how our immune systems work, they ramp up only as needed). Coughing and sneezing is a function of our immune systems that colds have evolved to take advantage of. There's a large body of study about every other coronavirus and rhinovirus and how they work, and this one isn't notably different in this regard.</p>

        <p>I mean, I linked to the CDC official statement from yesterday, seems to me that should be evidence enough of the current scientific opinion... but, if you want to go all Fauci fan-boy, here are some links.</p>
<p>Let's start with Fauci saying asymptomatic is never the driver <strong>(January 2020)</strong>: https://www.newsbreak.com/news/2075638740531/here-is-a-video-of-fauci-explaining-in-january-2020-that-asymptomatic-transmission-is-never-the-driver-of-outbreaks (I assume this is the statement you are hanging onto...)</p>
<p>Fauci: The WHO's remark that transmission of the coronavirus by people who never developed symptoms was rare "was not correct," (June 2020): https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/06/10/dr-anthony-fauci-says-whos-remark-on-asymptomatic-coronavirus-spread-was-not-correct.html</p>
<p>Fauci: 'About 40%-45% of Infections Are Asymptomatic' (September 2020): https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/937297</p>
<p>"You get one person who's asymptomatic and infected, and then all of a sudden, four or five people in that gathering are infected," (Oct 2020): https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fauci-says-small-gatherings-driving-new-covid-outbreaks-worries-about-n1245159</p>
<p>Even the Daily Mail were prepared to write an article about how Fauci had been misrepresented (June 2020): https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/fb-8517885/THE-WHITE-HOUSES-LIST-DR-FAUCIS-MISTAKES.html?ito=native_share_article-masthead</p>
<p>So he changed his mind.  Likely in response to the ever growing scientific research into covid.</p>

        <p>Personally I think fauci is an idiot. He changes his mind all the time, issuing conflicting statements while promising he follows the science. I use the reference because so many follow him blindlly</p>
<p>But then cdc and who also seem to have altered the findings of decades of science with little cause. Cdc flu pandemic docs showed lockdowns and masking to be inadvisable, in fact the control of healthy individuals was deemed a human rights violation as recently as the spring, when China did it, but we hadn't yet.</p>
<p>Who also decided to redefine herd immunity to requiring vaccines, which is odd, because the other kind has existed for hundreds or thousands of millenia.</p>
<p>It really seems like these policies change based on politics, and not science at all.</p>
<p>If we fall back to established science, we don't try to control or eradicate cold viruses, ( although the years of "cure for the common cold" jokes and scams are much funnier in 2020's context) . The science of tcells, antibodies, aerosols, immune systems, and such haven't changed this year, people just don't remember anything they learned in biology so the media can tell them whatever they want and they believe it!</p>

        <p>N95s only work if you wear them correctly, don't touch or move them, have a quality seal, don't move your face or neck much, and don't have facial hair. Even then they're not used to prevent cold and flu spread, but they're miserable to breathe through for any length of time.</p>

        <p>I haven't found them miserable to wear. I often forget I have mine on. I do typically keep a shaved or sparsely stubbled face, but that's not terribly difficult for me because my facial hair is not at all impressive. Certainly, wearing them correctly and bending the little metal nose bridge to make a good seal is important, and it is also not difficult or complicated.</p>
<p>The several mask studies that I have seen concur that the N95s work best, and do have an effect on blocking the virus.</p>
<p>Even if they do not prevent the virus forever, it's a positive thing if not everybody gets sick all at once. We only have enough health care for so many people at a time, so it's good to try to keep the number of sick people at our below the level that we can treat, so they don't die due to lack of medical treatment availability. The powers that be also have their lockdowns tied to the percentage of sick people, so wearing a mask to help reduce the spread, to get the percentages of infected people down, is the easiest and most direct way back to loosened lockdown restrictions.</p>

        <p>If you're not getting resistance from your mask, you're not breathing through the filter, and not protected for aerosols. Which means you don't have that seal, and maybe it isn't as easy as you think. Find a proper fit test that counts particle blow by during common actions like turning your bed and talking, and you will see exactly what a quality seal takes and feels like.</p>
<p>Hospitals weren't overwhelmed. Even cuomo insists they weren't in NYC in the spring. Surely not as bad as an actual flu season. This risk doesn't exist.</p>

        <p>The mask is sealed. It even expands and contracts. I just don't find it uncomfortable at all or difficult to breathe. It would get a little sweaty over the summer, but not now that it's winter.</p>
<p>I'm not some badass or anything, so I'm forced to conclude that masks are not terribly uncomfortable or restrictive for anybody without some kind of serious breathing problem or facial deformity.</p>

        <p>And yet pennsylvania just ruled masks couldn't be required for athletes because they restrict breathing.</p>
<p>If you're pulling air through an effective filter, it provides resistance. It's why we can't use hepa air filters for masks, our lungs can't pull through. It's also why masks don't protect against the pressure of a cough of sneeze, the filter provides resistance and the mask leaks around the seal.</p>
<p>You may not mind, it may not impact you negatively given your air volume needs, but it definitely resists, and definitely still leaks, even if you don't think it's much. Seriously, look up some details of mask fit tests that count particulates moving by the filters. People who are trained and tested every year have a very difficult time keeping even a moderate seal though head motions (up/down, side/side, grimace, speaking) and even passing the test still only do so with moderate blow by.</p>
<p>Btw, this is in contrast to a wide rubber mask seal like a common p100 paint/chemical fume (non disposable, really) or scba mask, which is much easier to seal, and for the latter, much more vital (but there are still annual tests and daily checks, because you still don't often know prior to inhaling gases in a fire.)</p>

        <p>I agree that a rubber seal would be better, and I've certainly considered going down to the army surplus and picking something like that up. But that seems like overkill for this particular virus, which is not likely to kill me since I'm not especially at risk. I don't trust the cloth masks, but KN95s are in that sweet spot of protection/cost/comfort for me.</p>
<p>I'm a daily smoker of cigarettes and cannabis, and have had asthma in the past, although I have not used an inhaler in many years. If I can comfortably breath in my properly-worn KN95, then it should be possible for most people.</p>
<p>I can understand that athletes may have trouble. At the same time, I see people jogging and running with masks every day, and they seem to be doing just fine. I'm not in great shape, but I've worn my mask on a 20-mile bike ride. It was fine for breathing apart from one big hill where I'm always panting and out of breath anyway, and it did get hot and sweaty in there.</p>
