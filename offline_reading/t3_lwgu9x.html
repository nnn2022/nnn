        <p>Masks are useless, especially when people aren’t sick. Assuming they do anything against viruses which pass through the majority of “face coverings”, even if they did do anything people are wearing them and aren’t sick. Why are we treating healthy people like lepers? Asymptomatic spread is rare and does not drive outbreaks. The PCR test gives false positives at the high cycle rates they are being used at (but that cycle rate was lowered in January by the WHO and more thorough diagnosis was required for each positive PCR test, which is why “cases” are decreasing). </p>
<p>https://www.who.int/news/item/20-01-2021-who-information-notice-for-ivd-users-2020-05</p>
<p>The death statistics from the virus are inflated due to the PCR test having high false positive rates. The inventor of the PCR test, Kary Mullis, has states that the PCR test has been misused by the medical community.</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/oaOZIcsicvM</p>
<p>Kary Mullis also heavily criticized Tony Fauci.</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/qPJnBSh_gXQ</p>
<p>So we have been living under the deception of a casedemic, and the reason why the majority of people who “die from Covid” are very old, and usually in nursing homes is because people who are very old and in nursing homes die a lot regardless of the year. That’s also why 94% of those who “died from Covid” had multiple comorbidities. The average age of death from Covid is higher than the average age of death, that should be all you need to know.</p>
<p>Word of advice is don’t strawman, you seem eager to attack people you don’t understand as you haven’t taken the time to consider what we have to say.</p>

        <p>You didn’t refute any of my points. The virus isn’t dangerous and only appears frightening to people due to misdiagnosis resulting from the high cycle rate of PCR tests resulting in high false positive rate. The creator of the PCR test arrests to this, as well as this fact about PCR tests being inaccurate at high cycle rates being common knowledge. Furthermore asymptomatic spread is rare and doesn’t drive outbreaks. You never answered any point I made. Are you assuming asymptomatic spread is a driver of outbreaks and is common despite there being no evidence for that being the case, and plenty evidence of that not being the case? If so I may as well force you to wear a hijab because I believe in Islam, this is the same thing as forcing people into a religion when it’s faith based and not evidence based.</p>

        <p>2 million people who died of what? I made several points to prove why I and many others believe this virus isn’t any more dangerous than viruses we usually encounter. Once again you didn’t address them. I’m going to be honest with you even though you will probably resent it: you’re stuck in a cult and don’t realize it. A faith based system, what did those 2 million people die from, based on what? PCR tests, many with cycle rates around 40 where false positives are in the percentage range of the 90s. My mother works as a doctor at Allina Health Climic, my cousin is a nurse, and my sheikh works in the medical lab. I’ve discussed this with them at length, and they acknowledge these points but at the end of the day they’re “just following orders”, to receive their paychecks and feed their families. </p>
<p>This is how this deception rolls on, because the lower down people simply do their work and don’t ask questions for fear of losing their job. Meanwhile Big Pharma which has a massive amount of influence over our government and media (literally sponsors most of our largest news organizations), is set to make bigger profits than they ever have. Furthermore there are other organizations looking to change our society which I won’t go into in depth but you can research for yourself, such as the World Economic Forum with its Great Reset. I understand it’s more comfortable to pretend this is all simply about a virus, but for how long can you remain ignorant to the way in which our society is being permanently changed, to a more restrictive society with less bodily autonomy and plain autonomy in general. I said you’re in a cult as harsh as it sounds and I mean it, a faith based system designed to guilt you into supporting the very actions which permanently remove our human rights.</p>

        <p>The surgeon mask is not used to prevent any viral transmission. The majority of studies of masks during surgery come to the conclusion that masks or no masks during surgery doesn’t make a significant difference. If the surgeon had the flu, they won’t operate on you. The mask wouldn’t be able to stop them from transmitting their virus while performing surgery. What the mask does is protect the surgeon from swallowing blood and anything else which comes from the patient during surgery. But aside from that the practice of masks during surgery is viewed as questionable. </p>
<p>https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Does-evidence-based-medicine-support-the-of-in-in-Bahli/751acd427c20c8dc7d1fbc1b45eead104286f481?p2df</p>
<p>The Japanese people wear face masks mainly because many of them suffer from hay fever, allergies from inhaling pollen. Pollen particles are much much larger than any virus, as you can search up for yourself. There is a belief among Japanese people that wearing a mask could help not get others sick, but this belief is based on faith not evidence. Every mask study we’ve had prior to 2020 showed them to be ineffective at stopping the transmission of respiratory viruses. Every culture has beliefs which are founded more on superstition than anything else, and this is one of them. </p>
<p>Regardless, you once again failed to address my points. You seem to be dodging the reality of the PCR tests at all costs, because that completely refutes the narrative you follow. At that point it doesn’t matter what the mask can or cannot do when the central issue is that the virus isn’t any more deadly than viruses we’ve had in previous years. That the statistics you cite for “Covid” deaths are immensely inflated. I could ask you, what happened to the flu? Influenza is near non-existent worldwide. In the US it’s incredibly low, and most hospitals and clinics do not test for it. You would like to argue that this is thanks to masks and Covid restrictions. Well, why has “covid” been so prevalent this whole time, at the same time people with your mindset argue that it’s because people aren’t wearing masks or following restrictions. This is why you belong to a faith based system, where you argue based on emotion, ignoring contradictions within your beliefs. There are so many contradictions in this “Covid pandemic” belief system that I could write a book on it. Do not be so arrogant as to not admit when you’re wrong. It’s not simply about your ego and always feeling like you never give in, but about being accurate.</p>

        <p>I see you participate in r/NoNewNormalBan. How infantile, looking to ban those who disagree with you. “They’re dangerous”, you may use an excuse for censorship. But you fail to prove that’s the case. The equivalent of how you behave is like a child who stick their fingers in their eyes and shouts to avoid what someone else is saying. Continually evading critical points I make which would refute your faith based belief system. If you’re not going to be reasonable I won’t continue to talk with you.
