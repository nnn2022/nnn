    <strong>So I Guess I'm Waiting to Die?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm vaxx'd and posting this on a alt account cause I don't want my post history out there. since stumbling upon your sub, I've had alot of restless nights digging thru all the "vaxx'd ppl are no good now.. you all are gonna die in 2 yrs" post you guys make on the regular. I haven't had any side effects (that I know of) and I got the jab at the end of April.  I live with my elderly parents and my grandmother (I pretty much caretake for them full time) and we all got vaxx'd at the same time, I believed I was doing my part to not bring anything home to them being I am usually the one out and about the most for things like grocery runs and the like. some of my online friends are vaxx'd as well but I know alot of ppl that are not. actually I know more ppl that haven't been vaxx'd than I do that have. all the independent podcasts that I listen to and trust the opinions of are all pretty anti vaxx. alot of my family have refused the vaxx and more and more I've been feeling like a fool and an outlier. I have tried to educate myself on how the spike proteins work and all I can do is hope I don't get any blood clots or heart problems. I plan on getting an MRI soon to check myself out and just hope I'm alive in a few years and that you guys are wrong about that part. I refuse to get any booster shots that may come up and I'll just try to live my life without constant worry that I may be a ticking time bomb and that I will not live to see the far future or live to inherent the things my parents are leaving me(I'm in my mid 30s). I feel if I can make it a full year at least without any major health problems I will be ok. so far so good, but I feel I am gonna worry myself sick some times when I get to going down the anti Vax rabbit hole when I can't sleep (which is often) feel free to be constructive (preferred) or troll me (I've been on the internet since I was 12 im a big boy)  I'm pretty sure I know what the majority of you believe, but I've been shocked by some of the civil convo I stumble across from time to time here..</p></p>

        <p>The fact is, I don't know what's going to happen to you, OP. None of us do. Hell, not even the manufacturers of the damned experimental gene therapy know exactly what's going to happen to you.</p>
<p>However, the fact that the results of the animal trials for mRNA treatments were...troubling, at best, leads a lot of us to be wary, even pessimistic or terrified.</p>
<p>This is one of those things that I want nothing more than to be wrong about, since it would literally slaughter my entire family and most of the people I know.</p>

        <p>If you feel it's necessary, you can get whatever experimental medications you want. The issue is when the government coerces its citizens into taking it to facilitate a massive wealth transfer from tax payers to billionaires.</p>
<p>The injections have no safety data and have shown to have very little efficacy. Most people will be fine, but the risks vastly outweigh any possible benefits.</p>
<p>The facts are that viruses are a part of life, the immune system works and old people die. Everyone seems to have forgotten that.</p>

        <p>Don't be so hard on yourself it sounds like you took the vaccine because you have family and you were trying to do the right thing. I don't think ill of people that do it, it just makes me anxious but none of us know what's going to happen. We can't predict it at all. And all the predictions may be untrue, and then you have to remember even if they are true to some degree and vaccinated people start having issues because of it there may also be remedies to that. There are lots of doctors who have been shunned and smeared over on Rumble and bitchute talking about exactly all of this, some even suggest things to do if you're vaccinated. Try not to worry too much , tomorrow isn't guaranteed for any of us just take it one day at a time and let's hope for the best. Also, if you're not going to take any of the boosters people are probably going to eventually call you in anti-vaxxer. I feel that one is coming down the line for a lot of people.</p>

        <p>We are all waiting to die regardless of whether or not we choose to be guinea pigs. At least you know how you might die now. If there wasn't such a weird agenda with all this stuff we wouldn't need to have these conversations. Some of us smell it in the air. The smell of propaganda and division.

        <p>There’s a reason they are planning many more rounds of shots. Everyone’s immune system responds differently and for some people it will take many shots to have an effect. This is valuable information to them.   No one should be wanting a booster shot is what I think. You might not be doomed.</p>

        <p>You got the vaccine.</p>
<p>There is no undoing this so live with it.</p>
<p>No amount of worrying about it will so much as add a day to your life, so there is no point.</p>
<p>If your family are anti-vax, then let them be.  You have the vaccine, if it's effective, you're safe, if you aren't safe, then it isn't effective and all of them getting it wouldn't make a difference.</p>
<p>I'm willing to bet that if you don't push them to get it, they will be fine.  Maybe they will bust your balls a bit, if so bust theirs back, but don't get too personal about it.  Family should be able to bust each other's balls in good fun.</p>
<p>If anyone outright rejects you, well, fuck them, they are assholes.  If you outright reject someone over it, well fuck you then, you're the asshole.  It's really easy, respect their medical decisions, and you put yourself on good standing to expect your medical decisions to be respected as well.</p>
<p>My personal feelings on the vaccine are that outside of the elderly, they are pretty pointless.  Yes some people are having horrible effects, but the chances are rather slim still, the odds are overwhelmingly in your favor, and all vaccines are risky to a degree.  Unfortunately this one IS still experimental.  I'm not saying that is good or bad, but the long term effects are unknown. I'm not pro or contra big pharma, but I do know that their bottom lines come first.  That doesn't mean that I don't recognize that they have given us numerous medical blessings, I just also know that they have given us numerous medical catastrophes as well.</p>
<p>In the end, what's done is done.  Once you're strapped in and the roller coaster is in motion, there's no getting off until the train is back in the station....or it valleys and you need rescuing, again, no emotional response you have will have an impact on which of those happen, so why waste your energy when you could use it for something more productive.</p>

        <p>Well, what can I say? I really hope for you, my parents and everyone else who got the vaccine that my fears about it are unfounded and irrational.</p>
<p>I visited my parents yesterday and my mom's health was better than it has been for a long time. We did blood-pressure readings and she was at 110. So even lower than mine at 112.</p>
<p>It would be easy to tell you, to think positive. But then again your story is just too relatable for me not to think I'd probably feel the same in your position.</p>
<p>I think I would try to avoid the nocebo effect. Believe in the power of your body to avert harm and flush out anything bad for you from your system.</p>

        <p>Think vaccine like smartphone updates, as long as its jist a bug but not bricked, a new software update (a.k.ka booster shot) maybe used to patch the bug (underlying symptoms).</p>
<p>With the whole population being the customers of few vaccine companies, rest assure they will do their best to patch these virus up, they need you alive until at least 2025 to maximize their profit. There will be few fatalities and serious complications but the general vaccinated people should be ok.</p>

        <p>Your stressing yourself out over nothing. If you had the shot and your fine, then your likely going to be fine.</p>
<p>Everytime you take that shot/booster, your playing roulette. It's the same with flu vaccines as well, which is why I dont take them for something I get once or twice a decade. It just isnt worth it for me, especially knowing I am prone to "unusual" reactions, and have been most of my life. Looking back, likely auto immune issues caused by a free government vaccine for "appalachians". But i was lucky, that time.</p>
<p>It's up to each individual to weigh the benefit's vs the risk's and decide accordingly. No one is to dumb to decide what they want to do. The rich have been saying that for millennia lmao.</p>
<p>Really though, they want these vaccines to be leaky, and they wouldnt want to intentionally kill the ones willing to take it, for science! It makes more sense they are trying to breed deadly variants of the virus and they need as many people to take it for that to happen. When it does, those who are vaccinated will be fine, but the unvaccinated will likely die in droves. The ones who dont will be the ones who have a superior natural immunity. It's also the largest clinical trial performed on the unsuspecting masses, all in an effort to research "the next generation" of medicine, lmao. </p>
<p>I am willing to bet that god, or the universe, whatever you want to call it, is on my side on this one. If not, I wont be missing anything when I pass from this reality.</p>

<p>I hope that it doesn't, at least you're awake now, and that's what matters. Let's just hope that this goes well and nothing goes wrong, although I'm like totally over my dead body.</p>

        <p>If you aren't already showing symptoms, you very well may be fine. I'm not waiting for long-term studies only to see if there are long-term effects, but also because we don't know WHICH members of the population are negatively affected nor WHY. With the types of adverse reactions reported, I don't want to risk it, but right now your greatest risk is your own anxiety and worry. </p>
<p>I read a fascinating study on the power of placebos, and it was astounding how much the body can heal from positive interactions and intentions. But it also noted we don't use placebos as treatments because they can also work the other direction with negative results of you believe something terrible is going to happen. The point being, we do not want to be ruled by fear. </p>
<p>If you're worried, don't go down anti-vaxx rabbit holes, use your time to research and develop healthy practices, exercise, get outside, cook healthy foods, etc. I started yoga a few years ago and highly recommend it. Remember that your time and mental energy shape your experience, some building a healthy body and healthy mind are your best defense.</p>

        <p>If you didn’t have any side effects at all and no issues.. You probably just got a saline shot, placebo or the nurse didn’t even push the plunger.</p>
<p>This is happening a lot as they can’t poison us all at once, would be to obvious. So they fake new variants and claim you need another shot.</p>
<p>The next bull shit story to come is, “your pets can give you Rona” as their now vaccinating zoo animals. Get ready for more crap propaganda followed by morons disposing their pets.</p>

        <p>Trust that we hope that 'we' are wrong about all this though the fact that we are merely sharing the opinions of great medical minds, says that we hope those doctors etc are wrong but we were vocal to prevent this exact scenario.
