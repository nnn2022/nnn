    <strong>My small activism role to keep living the normal.</strong>
    <p><p>Greetings! I am retired Canadian who now resides in a small fishing village in Mexico and very thankful for the freedoms that I now enjoy. I am very appalled by the loss of freedoms in many countries including the current sickening push to get the experimental gene therapy 'jab' into everyone including children. </p>
<p>If I was still living in Canada, chances are that I would be in jail by now for spreading misinformation since I continuously post anti-lockdown-anti-vax comments in every newspaper across Canada in hopes of waking up some the sheep. I am also pissed that I cannot visit friends and family in Canada unless I go through gestapo style entry. </p>
<p>I have previously worked in healthcare E.R., surgical suites and always refused vaccines along with virtually every doctor that I worked with. There were only a few doctors who subjected themselves to vaccinations and these doctors were all immigrants whom I presumed were too worried about saying 'no' to anything... They were complete ass-kiss docs who were always trying to please everyone in fear of losing their residency is my guess. </p>
<p>Now that I have plenty of time on my hands besides fishing, hanging out at the beach and drinking mojitos, I have started a few web projects since I dabble in building websites for some of the locals over the years, for free, to help them promote their trades and tourism businesses.   </p>
<p>I have also started some anti-covid activism type sites that are also free for the exception of one since offers a product but barely make any profit which is not a problem. As a matter of fact, I was actually losing money because I pay for state and provincial taxes on every order since I cannot get one of those 'reseller certificates" that various world governments now issue to get their slice of the pie. Not a big deal, I am cashed up and enjoy my basic web design hobby and just happy that individuals are walking around wearing my anti-lockdown-covid apparel, or what I call the new style of 'virtue signalling'!</p>
<p>I am currently developing at site to search locate businesses, restaurants, services, etc., that do not require you to wear a mask or show proof of vaccination.  I believe that this site may be a useful tool in the near future for us unvaxxed-unmasked folk. I was thinking that if local government mandates vaccine health pass cards, similar to what is happening in France, then the business can counter that dystopian bullshit by giving their customers and clients a 'membership' card that states the client is responsible for their own health. If they can implement their vaccine pass card, businesses should also be able to have their unvaxxed health card to shop and dine. This site is free and will always be free and would appreciate if any business owner out there would be kind enough to offer feedback or test the site. Search for "shopinfreedom"</p>
<p>I also created a free dating site for the unvaxxed after seeing the major dating sites marketing their members as 'vaccinated'. I am not in the dating game anymore but if I was, I sure in the hell would not want to stick my willy into some vaccinated female including procreating with anyone vaccinated in fear of having some sickly or 'thalidomide' style offspring. Let's keep normal genetics alive! The site is totally private, I would never consider selling personal information like most dating sites and highly regard confidentiality and privacy of all individuals. I am a retired Professor Emeritus of medicine and fully understand the importance of confidentiality.  This site is free and will always be free. Search: Unvaxxedlove</p>
<p>Lastly, I also enjoy doing graphic arts and started up a t-shirt site last year. I have not a clue if I am actually making a decent profit because it does not matter. What matters is that I appreciate others like myself who realize that this covid pandemic is nothing more than a scamdemic brought to you by nasty pharmaceutical companies and other world traitors who profit from the grief of humanity. I am also very pissed off that I cannot travel anymore, thus doing my small part for the resistance. This site also includes several news updates regarding the covid scam and hilarious, thought provoking statements. Search: plandemicshirts</p>
<p>For those who think I am just trying to market my stuff here, just kindly let me know what you are accomplishing to help fight this current dystopian mess. We need more activism NOT criticism to kill this evil beast cloaked as covid pandemic and just doing my small part.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p></p>
