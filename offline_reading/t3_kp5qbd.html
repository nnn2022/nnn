    <strong>Is there hope for 2021? (TW for suicide thoughts)</strong>
    <p><p>I ask this as a person who, honestly, sees no light whatsoever at the end of the endless tunnel.</p>
<p>I want there to be something to look forward to. I want to believe it's possible for this to end this year. But in truth, I don't. I knew from the time this started it would not end in 2020, but so many people insisted it would end after a certain period (after May, after July 4th, after summer, after Labor Day, after Halloween, after Thanksgiving, after Christmas) and called me a "tinfoil hatter". I believe the same will be true of the vaccine. That is, it <em>won't</em> be the savior so many are expecting it to be.</p>
<p>I cannot wait out another year. I utterly cannot. I'd much rather take my life - or die of the freaking virus - than live through another year of lockdown. Before this Christmas, I researched methods - which ones had the highest success rates - to do that and I confided in a friend about it. It's not about "winning". I don't care about "sticking it to anyone". Because that, to me, isn't worth waking up every day wishing I hadn't. I've already been through hell (as a teenager) and I hoped to never go through it again, but 2020 brought it back out in full force and it's not a hell worth living through 2021 with.</p>
<p>I've seen complaints of this sub becoming "reverse doomerism", and while I understand why some want to avoid that, I can't exactly disagree. I think false hope - continually being let down from always thinking positive - is worse than cynicism.</p>
<p>So, I refer to the title: Do you personally believe there's any light for 2021? Or are we in for it until 2022? To be clear, not the virus - of course, we'll have to live with that - but lockdown, masks, and restrictions.</p>
<p>(If location matters, I live in New Jersey. Never been ashamed of that until 2020.)</p></p>

        <p>I'm not sure, but it seems far from over.  We are seeing a lot of back and forth.  They lay out a bunch of shit, we push back, then they evaluate how we react and try to move forward while curbing our rebuttals and making new rules etc to try to keep the upper hand on public opinion.  They have shown that they are pretty ready to rub our faces in the dirt to get shit done their way and are blatantly discrediting and silencing opposition and promoting loss of autonomy.  </p>
<p>My hope is that if we are completely cut off from services that groups of us could claim land as our own seperate people.  Renounce citizenship and possibly be more or less left alone and they can vaccinate against everything and do what they want, live locked up on the internet I guess.</p>
<p>I obviously hope it does not come to that, but unless the media and governments completely walk this all back, the division will only increase, and with it the need for scared unreasonable people to try to control everything.</p>

        <p>Yes, there is hope. I really don't believe this will last a minute past June of this year. After the old and the obese get their vaccines there will be no justification left to continue doing this. </p>
<p>Life will never go back to March 2020. People will continue their paranoia and maybe things like hand sanitizer and masks in crowded places will continue for the weak. And all of that lost time is just that: lost. But largely, things will return to normal.</p>

        <p>The pandemic is not you. Therefore you can make a life without it. Honestly i have had to delete a lot of social media, get back on my anti depressants and making sure i have weed to smoke everyday. </p>
<p>Im trying to focus on my own journey although its hard to motivate myself. Focusing on mindfulness, breathing and local green areas like a garden, forest. The fresh air and trying to be mindful and grounded in the present moment really does help 'over time'. (At first i hated it and was very stubborn towards it, you need to let yourself be vulnerable in order to move forward).</p>
<p>Keeping your trauma and stress levels down via different strategies can help you feel physically better which can then hopefully provide you enough energy to throw yourself into distractions, activities, hobbies, crafts, organising, litter picking, good deeds.</p>
<p>Also reminding yourself of 'one' thing you are grateful for each day. </p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>
<p>p.s always self soothe!! you deserve care.</p>

        <p>I've certainly had thoughts that I wouldn't want to keep living like this. I wouldn't want to if I knew absolutely for sure things will never get better. I despise wearing masks and I love international travel more than anything. I'm not going to fly because of mask mandates and the fear I will get trapped in another country or quarantined so long it puts my cats lives at risk. </p>
<p>But I can't end my life because I have a child that depends on me to stay alive and stay positive. I also don't want to end my life because I don't know what the future holds. I'm 40 yrs old and still feel 20, so I know I have another 30 or 40 years of substantial life left. I'd hate to miss out because of a couple bad years. </p>
<p>2020 was blah for me. I kept my job and still had to go into an office, so I had it a lot better than most and can't judge. I became numb to it all by the summer. I've spent the last two days taking care of a lot of things I put off last year because I didn't have the energy. I made New Year's resolutions that only involve things I can control. I'm prepared for this year to equally suck and I can only hope things will get better soon and not get worse. That hope keeps me positive and able to deal.</p>

        <p>Hey, just letting you know there is someone who feels the same way as you. One result of this entire situation that is not often discussed is how intensely it has limited peoples options and affected those who are at some kind of transition in their lives. Whether it is moving to a new place, ending a relationship/marriage or graduating. Some of us have been left in absolutely horrible situations with no way to get out of that otherwise never would have happened.</p>
<p>I want so badly to believe that things will go back to normal soon, I really do, but I don't believe it. The goalposts have moved over and over and over again. Regardless of the efficacy of the vaccine, I was and still am hoping that once it is distributed, we will at least get some semblance of normal life back. Sometimes I really have to avoid this sub and any kind of news and try to just ignore what is happening and imagine a better future, even if I logically don't think it is going to happen.</p>

        <p>I relate so much to what you said in that first paragraph. I was graduating high school and was looking froward to being done with spending every single day and weekend alone, watching my school at parties and events. Since my friend group ditched me I had just gotten such bad anxiety that I finished the last year of school online. Before covid even started, I was struggling so much with the isolation. I can’t even describe the pain of being then trapped in a pandemic to struggle alone for an additional year+. It is at least comforting to know I’m not alone and others have been trapped in a bad spot</p>

        <p>Hi I’m 18 and I also live in New Jersey. Yes, there is hope. Yesterday if someone asked me during one of my episodes (borderline personality disorder) I would have screamed in their face and told them I could not take another day and there was no hope. But today I’m more stable and I know that there is. I was isolated two years before covid even started because of high school. My friend group ditched me, I quit high school and just finished it online. So I’ve been home and isolated without any friends or connections for about 3 years now. Covid in particular has been the absolute hardest, meanest and coldest year of my life. I can’t believe how much strength it has taken to get this far. I’m in a rage just waking up every day at this point. I hate being stuck in a place I hate living in. And these winter months are the worst of the year. I agree with you about the false hope thing and that its a waste. However, the fact that they are already distributing an effective vaccine is amazing. The vaccine will stop covid from being so deadly because those who are vaccinated are protected from the extreme immune system overdrive reaction (which is the catalyst for death due to covid). The people who do contract covid, and are vaccinated, are much more likely to have a mild case. Right now the vaccine rollout is slow, but a huge portion of this country is going to be vaccinated in the next six months, and it’s going to drastically reduce the number of cases and the death toll. As soon as I get the vaccine and its safe to leave, I’m leaving this stupid state and starting a life (social distancing, of course). I’m so excited to be protected. There is hope for 2021.</p>
