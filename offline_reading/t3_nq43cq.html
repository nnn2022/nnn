    <strong>What is the appropriate punishment for all those that have been unjustly enriched by selling fraudulent PCR tests and useless masks under false pretense?</strong>
    <p><p>I won't even get into the [not a] vaccine scam that's already been discussed ad nauseam here.  However, it's seems incredibly criminal and unjust that billions are being made off these scam tests which are well known to be entirely useless for diagnosing an active infection even according to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXm9kAhNj-4">the Nobel prize winning inventor of the test</a> not too mention the inappropriately cycle counts of up to 45+ that are known to produce false positives.</p>
<p>The maskers need a penalty for a whole other reason too - destroying the environment.</p>

        <p>I think it may be a good idea to ensure that the legal and justice/judicial branches are appropriately staffed by individuals who will perform their duties without the interference of any political agenda before throwing around appropriate punishments for what seem clearly to be crimes to us but oddly are handled as legitimate actions by propagandists who have assumed a stranglehold on the flow of "information".</p>

        <p>Thank you brother, I've been saying this from day one. The PCR tests are fucking useless, as Kary Mullis even said you can find anything that you want to find, if you amplify enough of a certain molecule. As he rightly stated in the video, it's how those in control interpret the results. </p>
<p>I'm going to say what many people want to say, and that is severe life-altering punishments is called for. I did get into a debate with a fellow member here on this sub on the topic of the death penalty, and my stance is that only after we hold a formal tribunal similar to the Nuremberg Trials, and get down to the very root and problem of how this fucking nightmare occurred (we know it was orchestrated but by whom or which groups and to what ends?), as well as we fucking need a total revamp of: </p>
<ul>
<li>politics (this first past the post bullshit is killing us!)</li>
<li>news media (for not holding politicians accountable! they're more like govt. propaganda stenographers!) </li>
<li>science (enough of this "trust the science" or "selective science" that the government only uses!)</li>
<li>education (seems more like indoctrination centers)</li>
<li>medicine (nowadays it seems like more bandaid solutions rather than curing the actual disease or causes that resulted in someone getting sick) </li>
<li>taxes and income (no more needs to be said!) </li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, fuck it, our entire society needs to be fucking overhauled. We got here because the system was created to corral and herd us into this dystopian direction. I'm not even sure if there'll be a way out, but if there's a chance we can win against our oppressors, then before killing them all off we need to fucking squeeze every ounce of info &amp; intell that they have, as we need to make the squeal who are the masterminds behind all of this shitfuckery! </p>
<p>Gates and Fauci are just poster boys. I think it goes even higher than rich assholes like the Vanderbilts, Bilderbergs, Rothschilds or Rockefellers. I bet it's families we've never even heard of.</p>

        <p>The PCR scam is only less criminal than the vaccine scam because the PRC test probably doesn't harm you physically in most cases.</p>

        <p>I know, but still the health officials and/or medical officers used the high amount of false positive data (as high as 97% according to one video podcast I listened to where sources were cited), and with that high amount of fraudulent data, it only helped the government as the scapegoat answer to locking us down.</p>
<p>I remembered no media asked the government (or barely any respectable media asking) about the accuracy of the PCR tests. Yes, there was some admittance in my province here in Ontario, but none of the news outlets ran with that. </p>
<p>Had the news done their job to ask and pressure the officials about "Wait a minute, so the daily case count and # of deaths might not be accurate? Then why the heck are we locking down??", as opposed to "This just in, 1000 new cases reported yesterday, back to you Bill", then we wouldn't be where we are right now. </p>
<p>I could see the PCR test being used to detain me. For example, I haven't ever taken the PCR test (as I don't want to be on some registry), but let's say I had to take it, and it either came back positive or negative. Well, I'm worried one day someone will knock on my door to inform me that I need to go into some facility due to how I'm still ill with the virus, even though I'm not showing any symptoms. This whole b.s. about "OMG, asymptomatic people are a danger!" scares the living shit out of me. When did a healthy person become a suspected asymptomatic carrier, who shows no signs of the virus? </p>
<p>Or what if I was known to the authorities as someone who's speaking out about these false positive results or how the vaccines are dangerous? I could foresee the PCR test used on me (knowingly or unbeknownst to me) and all of the sudden I'm detained against my will. While this is wild speculation, with what we've seen with this giant psyop false flag operation known as "covid-19", anything is possible now.</p>
