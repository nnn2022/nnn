    <strong>Serious question about "strains" and "variants"</strong>
    <p><p>Are they just a naturally occurring thing with cold viruses?</p>
<p>Wouldn't each new strain or variant be weaker than the original? So theoretically, people should be less and less concerned with each new "variant/strain"?</p>
<p>(these question presuppose that it's all true)</p>
<p>If it's all a lie, then what's the motivation behind new strains and variants? Today they announced a new "Vietnamese strain".</p>
<p>What's the goal here? Just to keep the fear levels high?</p>
<p>Would love some insight on this, especially from medical people.</p></p>

        <p>In a virus that jumps naturally from animals to humans you can expect it to get milder and milder with each generation to be more amenable to the host/propagate more effectively</p>
<p>This isn’t necessarily the case with gain of function viruses. They could—theoretically—become more lethal as they mutate.</p>

        <p>They're going to follow the same pattern as natural viruses once they're out in the wild. Random changes to its genetic code are more likely to break a function than enhance a function.</p>

        <p>Yeah I mean that would make more sense to me as well, and I’m inclined to agree, but it was two evolutionary biologists talking and they seemed to be saying that it could go the other way on us. It least to my recollection that’s what they were saying.</p>

        <p>Just watched the clip, thanks for saying which one it was so it was easy to find!</p>
<p>My understanding of what they said, and I could be wrong so other interpretations are welcomed, was that the mutations can be selected for in the laboratory to make the virus more dangerous and transmissible, and that's one way gain of function research works. If they put the virus in a dish with a mix of human airway cells and a few of whatever animal cells they normally infect (note: the real process is probably a LOT more complicated), and if it happens to mutate to be able to infect the human cells, that strain will be able to outcompete the ones that can't. Artificial selection pressure in the lab can direct mutations towards a trait, such as easily infecting humans, by setting up conditions that favor strains with that trait.</p>
<p>Once a strain is actually out in the world infecting people it should behave normally and trend towards less lethal and possibly more contagious, since those are the virus traits human behavior would select for.</p>

        <p>The strands are supposed to become more contagious but less deadly. It's not in the virus' best interest to kill its host.</p>
<p>Somehow, that logic doesn't apply to COVID.</p>

        <p>That's because covid is a monster! I heard one of the talking heads a couple of months back talking about how covid had killed all the old people and was now turning it's attention to younger people. That's why they were seeing higher mortality rates. Also the curfews. Covid comes out at night. It's a B movie monster!!!</p>

        <p>"variants" are what happens when the algorithms use different genetic material to build the "viral genomes". </p>
<p>This is how they "discovered" "SARS-COV-2" by assembling RNA fragments from samples with multiple sources of genetic material using an algorithm.</p>
<p>&rt;RNA extracted from <strong>bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid</strong> and <strong>culture supernatants</strong> was used as a template to clone and sequence the genome. We used a combination of Illumina sequencing and nanopore sequencing to characterize the virus genome. Sequence reads were <strong>assembled</strong> into contig maps (a set of overlapping DNA segments) <strong>with the use of CLC Genomics software</strong>, version 4.6.1 (CLC Bio). Specific primers were subsequently designed.</p>

<p>Putting aside the problems with virology for a second, yes, that would make sense under normal circumstances. However, in this case, the "more infectious new variants," so called, are being created by the vaccines: https://rairfoundation.com/bombshell-nobel-prize-winner-reveals-covid-vaccine-is-creating-variants/</p>
