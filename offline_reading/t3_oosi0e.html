    <strong>Asymptomatic Spread is a Farce, as proven by a study of 10 Million People.</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19802-w">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19802-w</a></p>
<p>A study out of China shows that asymptomatic spread simply does not exist. They studied 10 million residents and found no spread from asymptomatic positives. Some other important notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>"There were no positive tests amongst 1,174 close contacts of asymptomatic cases."</li>
<li>"In the present study, virus culture was carried out on samples from asymptomatic positive cases, and found no viable SARS-CoV-2 virus. All close contacts of the asymptomatic positive cases tested negative, indicating that the asymptomatic positive cases detected in this study were unlikely to be infectious."</li>
<li>"Existing laboratory virus culture and genetic studies showed that the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 virus may be weakening over time, and the newly infected persons were more likely to be asymptomatic and with a lower viral load than earlier infected cases."</li>
</ul>
<p>Nature communications is also one of the most trusted science journals. And if you don't trust China, but took the vaccine, you are a victim of ignorance. China sent the genome to the vaccine companies so that they could program the mRNA "vaccines."</p></p>

        <p>Whenever someone says asymptomatic people can spread a virus I just tell them that they need to stop being a dumbass and learn what 'viral load' means.</p>
