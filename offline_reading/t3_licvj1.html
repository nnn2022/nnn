        <p>Reminder that 90% of scientific “experts” are also complete autists who truly have almost no bearing on the real world whatsoever. </p>
<p>That’s such a ridiculous yet “scientific” statement, and even though it doesn’t actually apply in real life they’d likely have a major tantrum if you tried explaining to them that in real practice you actually physically block odors from your nose.</p>

        <p>A pathogen us a gigantic and complex molecule. A fart is methane, CH4. 5 atoms, that's it, and sulfur dioxide, SO2. 3 atoms. A pathogen? Much more. An average cell contains 100 trillion atoms.</p>
<p>A semi-permeable membrane needs to let O2 through, so do you not think CH4 will pass? Of course, a pathogen will certainly find it hard to pass.</p>

<p>Its really sad how you don't know that. I'm losing faith looking through New.</p>

        <p>Yeah, but covid is a virus, not a cell. It’s a particle. A covid virion measures around 50-200 nm. Also, a fart is actually more than just a few atoms. It also consists of more elements: Nitrogen, Hydrogen, CO2, O2 &amp; Methane. Gases will diffuse through the mask, because they are much, much smaller than the virus particle. So you’re right about that. A mask stops some Covid particles entering your nose/mouth, but not all, and the cloth masks aren’t really all that effective.</p>

        <p>Masks aren't meant to stop it coming in. It could enter through eyes. Its meant to stop you releasing pathogens at high speed.</p>
<p>Try it. Fill a surgical mask with water. It won't drip through. </p>
<p>Masks critically reduces the escape velocity of the droplets from your mouth and nose, so it kinda hangs in place indoors and drops to the ground. With a 2m distance it's unlikely you'll be hitting anyone. Try it outside on a cold day. Its why glasses steam up. Your breath escapes through the top of the mask so it doesn't get laterally much.</p>
<p>I literally said a fart contains methane already. Nitrogen, CO2 and O2 make up the majority of air anyway, they're nothing new.</p>
<p>If masks didn't work they wouldn't have been in existence and used by medical professionals for decades. Masks didn't just suddenly appear in 2019.</p>
