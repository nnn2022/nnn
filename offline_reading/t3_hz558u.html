    <strong>New ”Liberals Against Lockdowns” Instagram account!</strong>
    <p><p>Hi everyone! I just wanted to share that I’ve created a new Instagram page, @liberals.against.lockdowns!</p>
<p>The account is currently brand new and has only one post, but I intend to use it partially to help shut down the idea that being against lockdowns and other similar measures is “anti-science” or a stance held only by conservatives, and partially to help dismantle the misinformation and sensationalism surrounding the virus in general.</p>
<p>I’d also like to mention that, despite the name, people who do not consider themselves to be liberals are more than welcome (and even encouraged!) to follow and interact with the account. While I definitely want to set an example for other liberals and make it clear that taking this stance is not “a conservative/Trump supporter/etc. thing,” the goal is certainly not to contribute to any further division, and all respectful input will be welcomed!</p>
<p>If anyone has any suggestions about how to run the account or what to post (either specific information you’d like to see highlighted or more general suggestions), I would love to hear your ideas!</p>
<p>If you would like more information about why I created the account, you can view the first post <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CDKabW-gih8/">here</a>.</p></p>

        <p>Exactly! I think the way some people have been so determined to make it a partisan issue has really distracted from the real issue at hand. I suspect that most people would be against these things if they were not developing preconceived notions based on political party affiliation, and if they had better access to reliable, unbiased information that would help them to assess the level of risk we are actually dealing with.</p>

        <p>As a former liberal who doesn’t vote, I fully support you. No liberal should ever support lockdowns. </p>
<p>They are anti free expression, anti freedom of religion, anti freedom of movement, anti social cohesion, and perhaps more importantly, they disproportionally harm the poor while protecting the rich. </p>
<p>Also they don’t work.</p>

        <p>Thank you! Honestly, in the beginning, I expected a lot of criticism of lockdowns to come from liberals. The impact on mental health is devastating, children are being thrown under the bus, and like you said, poor people are suffering disproportionately. I’m admittedly still a little shocked by the way these glaring issues keep being glossed over in spite of how much data we have that pretty clearly demonstrates how little lockdowns and other measures are actually accomplishing and how low the level of risk associated with the virus actually is.</p>

        <p>Ya it’s surprising to me too how much data cherry picking has been going on. Liberals are just buying the narrative hook line and sinker! All the data on the harms of lockdowns is being systematically censored. </p>
<p>Honestly I think it’s all a big ploy to get Trump out of office. That’s the only explanation that makes any sense at this point. </p>
<p>Covid has become a giant straw man. They want us to focus on the pandemic and on nothing else. Why? Because they know it’s not going away despite all their dumb rules. Deaths are gonna keep climbing no matter what we do. Americans were never gonna socially distance. By the time the election comes, they will just blame trump for the whole thing. It’s all calculated...</p>

        <p>It is really shocking how much data has been cherrypicked and censored. Like, I genuinely had no idea how much of a slant could be put on news by sources I otherwise considered reliable until I began to see blatant examples of the bastardization and misrepresentation of data and research. A lot of people have been misled into believing they are doing the right thing in supporting these measures, and it’s honestly kind of a tragedy. I found it hard to come to grips with at first because I thought that this sort of idea was a conspiracy theorist thing, but it is completely undeniable at this point that the mainstream media is absolutely not giving us an accurate view of this situation.</p>
<p>I definitely think political opportunism is at least part of why this is happening, which is insane. I don’t care what side you’re on or what your goal is, it is not worth all of this damage.</p>

        <p>Agreed! </p>
<p>Kind of hard to be an objective consumer of news when all the news is carefully handpicked and filtered to support a single point of view. (Rona bad, lockdown good). This makes it so otherwise smart people can get completely brainwashed without even realizing it. </p>
<p>Honestly it feels like 1984 or Brave New World to me. But I’m sure they don’t make kids read those scary dystopian books in school anymore... </p>
<p>...oh ya nevermind school is closed because education is no longer deemed “essential.” 😳</p>

        <p>I'm so happy to see this thread. I've always identified as a left-wing Democrat but I'm watching my party in complete bewilderment right now. WTF is going on?!! In addition to just looking at some of the science - very selectively- and seeming desperate to prove the narrative that everyone is going to die from COVID, there seems to be an expectation that 1) we completely shut down schools; 2) no one can ever ever be at risk and somehow it's the government's job to ensure that and 3) everyone should get unemployment benefits forever. I can see supporting one of those, but all three is so entitled it's breathtaking.</p>
