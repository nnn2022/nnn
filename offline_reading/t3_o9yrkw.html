    <strong>The Destiny of Doomers is Only To Be Lab Rats and Obedient Slaves to Their Master Fauci and the Government.</strong>
    <p><p>Some doomer messaged Me yesterday. While I ignore these people, I just wanted to see what "intellectual" stuff he will bring. So, I let him say whatever and you guessed it correct. Other than calling Me all the names in the book, he had nothing beneficial to say. I showed him statistics and logic of whatever is happening around us and guess what? He kept repeating the same bs over and over like those characters in movies who only have that 1 dialogue to say repeatedly. These are the "great" and "intellectual" beings that you are up with.  They literally don't know anything.</p>
<p>After observing many of the doomers irl and on reddit, all of you are the same. Lazy, unambitious and had no lives prior to covid. You fools only find virtue and happiness in being lab rats to test whatever your Master, who is the government and Fauci commands you to. You doomers love virtue signaling us if we protest or don't mask, yet, you all are sitting in your homes hoping this covid nonsense doesn't end. Why? Because you love those petty government checks and you don't want to go back to your old miserable fucking lives. But you guys forgot something. The same stimulus checks that you're all getting won't be worth shi in the near future due to the <strong>massive</strong> inflation that's on it's way. Only a clown would get fully vaccinated only to still mask up and want these draconian lockdowns to never end. Who in the right fucking mind is that foolish?</p>
<p>It makes you feel good huh seeing all of us locked up in our homes and in misery? You blind idiots do not see the economic destruction that is here, and more restrictions that are coming. You fuckers only love getting fucked in the ass hard by your Master WHO (World Health Organization). You are their little free to use rag dolls. You socialists/communists are the lowest of the low. You have gave up your freedoms, basic rights and honor for a fucking disease which has a <strong>99.7% survival rate.</strong> Are you that dumb to give up everything for this? Masks don't do shi (many studies have been done on this) and social distancing is dividing Us more than ever, and people literally fear each other now. If I was to social distance Myself from anyone, that would be from you worthless doomers. </p>
<p>You conveniently overlook suicides, people being denied medical treatment in favor/fear of Covid, small businesses going under, government's growing tyranny with power and blatantly flaunting their own rules, your friends and families collective-mental health plummeting, children's education and development suffering, and the figures and statistics from States like Florida and Texas which have gone down, in your, borderline psychopathic endorsement of lockdowns and face masks. You Doomer's only ambition in life is to obey, bow down and be a slave to the government and to add the cherry on top, you will quad mask to please your Masters even more. </p>
<p>And oh, also, to be their lab rats to test this experimental vaccine for them, not knowing the long term side effects of it. And, for the ones who obediently took the vaccine and still are double masking and social distancing, WTF. How fucking stupid you have to be to do that? And yet, you still virtue signal us, while you are making fool of yourselves. Your Master Fauci and his crew are laughing their asses off rn looking at you and I bet it's hard for even them to believe, how easy it is to brainwash and manipulate this clown society for their own gain and benefit. </p>
<p>And for the people on this Sub, we didn't come into this world to be fucking lab rats. Fuck that. We came here for a purpose which is to do whatever the hell we want to do, and have freedom in this so called "free" country who promised us our basic rights and freedoms. There is no high in living just a boring and simple life and submitting to the government which y'all love to do. Rather, life is a wonderful adventure and no 1 should be able to stop us. I personally like to live My life on the edge and love to take all the risks. Time is very limited here and life is very short and we must make the most of it and do whatever we want in this limited time. No fucking 1 should be able to take our basic rights away. Fuck them. And you doomers, go back to your old and miserable lives, who's only source of happiness is by commanding others to quad mask.</p></p>
