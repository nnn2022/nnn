        <p>Please everybody; STOP running on the hamster wheel of incessant mask debate, and start learning and talking about the things that people <strong>CAN DO</strong> for themselves to help their immune systems function properly instead of injuring or killing them when challenged with weak pathogens such as SARS2 virus or influenza virus.</p>

        <p>Vitamin C, D, and Zinc.  And of course eat healthy/exercise.  I think it's common sense.  We need the mask debate because the masks have to end, one way or another and I would argue that they're perpetuating the fear of this "crisis" right now.</p>

        <p>&rt;I think it's common sense.</p>
<p>Yes, that sounds like common sense and common sense is what has gotten us to the point where there's about 1.35M deaths around the world and about 256K deaths in the US attributed (rightly or wrongly...) to this pretty weak virus, there's idiotic masks mandates in a lot of places around the world, some places are actually under stupid lockdowns right now (AGAIN), a whole lot of people are literally frightened out of their minds, 10s of millions of people have lost their jobs, hundreds of millions of people are now at risk of starving to death, I don't even know how many businesses have permanently closed, deaths of dispair have skyrocketed, and people are in fact reporting to hospitals and taking up beds for care due to infections from this pretty weak virus.</p>
<p>Common sense is working out pretty badly.</p>
<p>The human immune system requires about two dozen nutrients to function properly, including the ones that the body needs to properly metabolize the others.</p>
<p>Here's a real good paper (from 2020) that discusses many of them in real good detail:</p>
<p>https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/1/236/htm</p>
<p>The observant reader can notice how numerous nutrients are required for various processes in the immune system to function correctly that are specifically indicated by numerous COVID research publications as <strong><em>not</em></strong> working correctly in various portions of people that require hospital care, as well as related topics such as production of antibodies, T cells, and so on.</p>
<p>Here's "Handbook of Nutrition and Immunity", an ebook from 2004, 382 pages, that has quite a lot of information about the immune system and <strong>Chapter 6 in particular</strong> talks about individual nutrients (including some that I don't list among the ~two dozen required by the immune system and body otherwise) and the roles they can play, to the extent known up to 2004:</p>
<p>http://digilib.unimus.ac.id/files/disk1/138/jtptunimus-gdl-mericgersh-6854-1-ebookscl-y.pdf</p>
<p>Here's a paper from last month about some phytonutrients that can help the immune system:</p>
<p>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13659-020-00271-z</p>
<p>&rt;Vitamin C, D, and Zinc.</p>
<p>Yes, those are required by the immune system, but nutrition in the immune system is an ensemble cast; there are no superstars.  In other words, it's like a symphonic orchestra that has a bunch of seats each for a whole lot of different instruments, and every seat needs to be filled for it to be able to play the musical piece as well as possible.</p>
<p>There's a bunch of papers relating status of specific nutrients to COVID-19 specifically.  Omitting the ones about zinc, C, and the couple dozen or so about D (I don't know why people are so fixatted on D; not only are there no superstars, but the body requires about half a dozen other nutrients for D to work out properly), here's a few:</p>
<p>"Reduced Vitamin K Status as a Potentially Modifiable Risk Factor of Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019" (27 August 2020)</p>
<p>https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa1258/5898121</p>
<p>"Is copper beneficial for COVID-19 patients?" (5 May 2020)</p>
<p>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720308136?via%3Dihub</p>
<p>"Association between regional selenium status and reported outcome of COVID-19 cases in China" (28 April 2020)</p>
<p>https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/111/6/1297/5826147  (article giving broader info about this study:  https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200429105907.htm  )</p>
<p>"Selenium supplementation in the prevention of coronavirus infections (COVID-19)"  (24 May 2020)</p>
<p>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030698772031104X</p>
<p>&rt;And of course eat healthy/exercise</p>
<p>This paper describes how some exercise can promote the immune system and other exercise can cause immune dysfunction (but read the paper to understand that properly):</p>
<p>"The compelling link between physical activity and the body's defense system"  (16 November 2018)</p>
<p>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095254618301005</p>
<p>Here's a couple of videos from "Ninja Nerd Lectures" that can help to understand why it's the <strong>immune system</strong> that is the problem in some people, not actually the virus itself:</p>
<p>https://youtube.com/watch?v=PWzbArPgo-o&amp;t=987</p>
<p>https://youtube.com/watch?v=YRfwZcLeOm4&amp;t=1382</p>
<p>There's SO MUCH more to it as far as what actually meaningful things (unlike the idiotic masks) that people <strong>CAN DO</strong> for themselves to help their immune system not check them into the hospital when they get an infection from weak viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 or influenza, but this is a good start.</p>
<p>So ... keep running nowhere on the hamster wheel, or start actually fixing the problem???</p>
