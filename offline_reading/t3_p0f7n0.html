    <strong>What is it we seek to protect by developing these vaccines in the first place? Are we protecting people's lives or certain people's pride?</strong>
    <p><p>Just looking at all of the protests in nations across the globe by different peoples of different ethnicities, speaking different languages, having different cultures and the reactions of mainstream media outlets from "top" posts on this very website to "news" media which has been limited or non-coverage, it's clear the message doesn't get across to the people it needs to the most.</p>
<p>If we have the goal of protecting life, it’s because we see the value which life holds, we’re logical and reasoning people. Life is valuable because of what people may do with it. You remove the freedoms that we preserve life to protect in the first place, and you lose all logic and reason for doing so. I’m no longer on your side or anybody’s side besides the side of people whose freedom I want to protect who I wish to empower with my own freedom. They are not who I wish to control or use for my own ends, which can be selfish or good just like yours and anybody’s may be. I’ll only ever endorse behavior I consider good. I won't consider something good unless I can see for myself and determine as an individual that it is the case. Trying to control others without the clear reasoning, which I myself can see, indicating it is necessary, will always be immoral. I could do evil without even acknowledging it. So, controlling free people, and specifically decisions they make about their own health which are known to be relevant to whether they'll live or die, and could be consequential beyond what we can scientifically prove at this time with evidence that would lead free-thinking people to a logical conclusion themselves about what decision to make, is immoral. It is careless for life, the very thing you claim others to be so that you might control them in your prideful and immoral sickness. Who is in need of a cure, really?</p>
<p>You are nothing. You do not impact me. You do not matter to me with what you'd force on me or others because you are not somebody I care about. I love and care about many people in my life with all my heart and they are my life so I tell you again that you are irrelevant to my life, to my happiness, to my experience on this planet, regardless of what you do, so you could be dead or have never lived as far as I am concerned as you are nothing to me. If that is the case for everybody, I see no difference between you and the nothing dirt under my feet which is nothing to me and nothing to everybody else that steps over it. I cannot stress to you enough how much of a nothing you are to me and everyone that receives your message and the extent of your efforts to convince yourself that is not the case when simply it is now and forever as a matter of fact because of the truly nonexistent impact you have which proves that. You can tell a man from the fruits of his labors. The fruits of your efforts are for nothing so they are nothing. It will not get in the way of my loving others and protecting their freedom with everything I am because that is all that I am because love is all that there is and all that I’ll do which matters. Your pride does not even get one second or inkling of power over the beauty of life which you have rejected for your sickness. Pray for people like yourself is all we can do after crushing the evil you’d bring about to our peaceful lives if you could you small and miserable person.</p></p>

        <p>Imma have to respectfully disagree with that last paragraph.. looks like you’ve been impacted enough to write that up.. if we didn’t consider each other like the dirt under our feet, respected our free will as you speak would we be in this situation?</p>

        <p>What’s important for a person is going to be there for them and they’ll be perfectly able to live their life as they need to for their contentment always no matter what consequences the actions of others have on them. It will always be the case that you’re free in your will and nothing on the earth can separate God from one of His children. </p>
<p>It is true that they have no impact when actions are taken in weakness and especially those taken in malice for evil because misery loves company. We’re always blessed. Remain above them where you are.</p>
