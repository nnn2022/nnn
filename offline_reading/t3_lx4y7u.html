    <strong>Question About the Mechanics of How COVID Spreads</strong>
    <p><p>How do doomers explain/justify eating out? Every place I've been to obviously enforces the mask mandate rule where you gotta wear one waiting for a table, walking to a table, and leaving the restaurant. But once you sit down the masks can come off and COVID gets scared of food so apparently isn't deadly or contagious anymore? The argument that I've heard loosely is that because the seats are socially distanced, no ones at risk, but that's more or less bullshit because when the server comes to the table aren't they being put directly in the line of fire? (I can promise my waiters are NOT standing 6 feet away from me to take my order.) And it doesn't matter if they're wearing a mask anyway because COVID magically can only be blocked from one side of the mask, rendering the poor waitstaff doomed to downright MURDER. So, I ask the question, how do doomers who are hopelessly addicted to eating out justify their blatant disregard for even one human life? How does eating stop the spread of COVID for the few hours it takes to finish a meal? Am I crazy, is there some pivotal SCIENCE that I'm missing? Genuinely curious, any and all answers appreciated.</p></p>

        <p>Ha! That is a very good question OP. One Iâ€™ve often asked myself. Along with, how is it that Covid has a bedtime and goes dormant at the exact time the cities choose as their nightly curfew? Also, how is it that Covid doesnâ€™t spread at protests, any/all large corporate owned business, or even in the great state of Florida and especially at the Super Bowl? Itâ€™s so amazing how it only spreads when and where the federal government says it does! What a smart virus, we better watch out. ðŸ™„</p>

        <p>The most hardcore don't go out to eat. I know many people that haven't eaten in a restaurant for over a year and don't plan on doing so until 2022 at the earliest.They actually believe that eating in restaurants is dangerous and reckless, and though completely insane and fueled by misinformation and fear, at least they are being consistent with their beliefs. </p>
<p>The people going to restaurants, but who still insist on masks, basically are hypocrites. Their motivation is not really about the virus or saving lives at all. These people are motivated by politics, virtue signaling, and trying to stay consistent with their year long obsession with masks. They've gone all in on masks, and they've basically painted themselves into a corner requiring them to always wear them, even though deep down they want things to be normal too. They can never admit they were wrong and must keep up the charade regardless of how ridiculous it is. It's not about logic or anything rational. It's about emotions and pride.</p>

        <p>I'd like to know what makes "fast-spreading" variants spread so fast. There's gotta be a mechanism right? Like in plague inc. you can e.g. make people sneeze.</p>
<p>But generally COVID spreads through your breath, duh. At a restaurant, well... a certain level of experience has to be maintaned. And it is impossible to eat through a mask.</p>
