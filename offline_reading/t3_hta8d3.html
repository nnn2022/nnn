        <p>&rt; For five Los Angeles families, that has meant spending $22,500 in the last three months to create what they’re calling a “micro-school” for their pre-school aged kids. They hired an interior designer to build a makeshift classroom with an art pavilion at one of their homes and contracted the services of a local teacher to come three days a week. She creates bespoke lesson plans about age-appropriate topics, like the alphabet and human emotions.</p>
<p>Too bad for your kids if you don’t have $22k laying around plus salary funds for your own teacher.  </p>
<p>&rt; In the last three months, Weekdays, a Seattle-based company that helps parents set-up in-home daycares and schools, said it has helped organize 100 micro-schools around the country.</p>
<p>&rt;”We’ve been overwhelmed with inquiries,” Shauna Causey, Weekdays’s founder, said.</p>
<p>&rt;The costs vary but can run into the thousands of dollars each month. Some parents say they pay $100 to $200-an-hour for private tutors. On Weekdays and a similar service called School House, teachers are encouraged to set their own rates, but the organizations say the cost is comparable to daycare.</p>
<p>How many families can afford this ?  I guess the rest just get left behind.  It wouldn’t surprised me if some teachers are moonlighting while they are supposed to be doing zoom school.</p>

        <p>I have already seen several posts on Next Door from people looking to hire a teacher to form small-group "pods" for educating their elementary school kids at home.</p>
<p>and this:  <strong>"Educational experts worry these class divides will exacerbate inequalities. In families who can’t afford private childcare, “those children are going to miss out on a lot of educational opportunities,” said Simon Workman, director of early childhood policy at the Center for American Progress. “Or, the family is not going to be able to work—and that has a huge financial and economic impact.”</strong> </p>
<p>Of course. It's like the whole goal of Newsom's plan was to exacerbate inequalities by keeping the schools closed. It's going to have far reaching implications for years to come.</p>

        <p>&rt;She already has a master’s degree in English, but was hoping to go back to school for social work. 
&rt;“Our kids learning remotely is better than our kids sick or dying,” Ludwig said.</p>
<p>yeah for starters she's pissing money away on another useless master's degree, and she's likely old enough to remember chickenpox</p>

        <p>There have always been groups of parents creating "co-op" schools for one reason or another so it's not unprecedented and hopefully there is material out there already to help them.</p>
<p>It's too bad that parents are being forced into it now though.</p>
