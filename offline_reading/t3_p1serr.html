        <p>You know what’s crazier? Her husband is on a H1B visa in US right now. Lawrence Sellin had a screenshot of I94 of her husband.</p>
<p>They believe the communist party want her husband here in order to manufacture some accident to have her killed. These theories are brought up by Lawrence sellin in his Twitter account, he is now banned tho.</p>

        <p>To confuse. The totalitarianism is happening in almost every country in the world. To think that there isn't an agreement to follow the script is absurd at this point. When in your lifetime have you seen almost every country worldwide agree to do something the same exact way? This is a first for me. Even Iceland, a country that recently toppled it's bankers and rewrote it's constitution, is along for the ride. Their chief epidemiologist recently said on a radio show that their people need to focus on only vaccinating the most vulnerable and let the rest acquire immunity naturally. By the next morning he was retracting everything he said. Anyways, back to Yan.</p>
<p>I read her original report. I was very interested. I'd even say excited. I read the entire thing. I read an entire peer review that argued against it. Her follow-up paper she promised was supposed to show the RatG-whatever the fuck (it's been a minute) virus sequence was in fact CCP militarized and then the genome was rewritten as C19 after the fact. Without proving her points the holes in her story were too large to ignore. And that's from someone that was salivating with hope that she would put a dent in the charade.</p>

        <p>Not only that. The damn virus hasn't been isolated/purified. I'm pretty far in the "viruses might not exist camp." I didn't start out that way, mind you. I started reading about the holes in virology when COVID happened.</p>
<p>The spike protein supposedly causes all the symptoms unique to COVID. We know the vaccine makes people shed spike. And the PCR test means they way over count COVID cases. It's entirely possible, I'd say likely, that there is no virus, just isolated (at least until mass vaccination) outbreaks of spike poisoning.</p>
<p>There was an outbreak of a "respiratory illness" in a nursing home near Fort Detrick in August 2019. Nursing homes provide a great place to experiment on people with little oversight. I bet that was one of the outbreaks of COVID in the US.</p>
<p>Another doctor who supported at least some of what Yan said is Alina Chan. She recently wrote a book on the possible origins of COVID. The ONLY thing she ruled out was that the "virus" had multiple origins. She also doesn't have a bad thing to say about vaccines. She's also Canadian with Chinese ancestry... Hm.</p>
<p>I'm kind of rambling here but I just wanted to point out that all of this is a distraction from a very specific fact: there is no virus. I mean, Dr Yan was able to appear on Fox News in the first months of the pandemic. Fox News is as controlled opposition as it gets. That should tell you something about the "man made virus" angle.</p>

<p>Btw, numerous senator/congress person has spoken to her recently, and in particular, Mo Brooke released a public statement regarding her legitimacy. https://brooks.house.gov/media-center/news-releases/congressman-mo-brooks-reports-interview-dr-li-meng-yan-regarding-covid-19</p>
<p>Also just last week, Yan had a online Q&amp;A session with the house freedom caucus.</p>
<p>At the moment it seems she is in protective custody because according to herself (and another YouTube person that she first contacted) the communist party has issued commands to kill them on sight in US.</p>

        <p>They reference this in the symposium from doctors for covid ethics. In the first vid… it’s all worth watching. But yeah. I mean he says ‘I can’t confirm it but ya know’ clearly I am paraphrasing hard. </p>

        <p>tbh nothing can be trusted as far as I'm concerning when war is close , the bankers always build the 2 sides and then start to show us why need to go &amp; wage war against the other side how bad it is and how are they planning to destroy the world.. same old tactics .</p>
<p>I don't think china has anything to do with the virus because they already won the economy war and all they have to do is to wait for USA to collapse . covid19 was going to get out either way to destroy the economy . </p>
<p>and to deploy the  "Great reset agenda" china doesn't seems to be interested in this plan . even putin at davos didn't like the whole idea of demolition all border for world government which was pretty much clear from his talks.  </p>
<p>so to me the problem the elite have is China if china economy is functioning they can't take her to the great reset they manged to completely use the elite for their own agenda and throw them after that . </p>
<p>china now become almost independent  and all it's needs right now is Taiwan technology and she can literally stand on equal ground against USA . </p>
<p>so there's 2 options :</p>
<p>- the elite use this bad propaganda against china to initiate WW3 that's why they are building the bunkers.  they know that shit is going to hit the fan if they don't find a solution with the Chinese (the main problem with china is not only economic  it's a religious problem most Chinese people are atheist but they don't believe in transgender or trans-humanism , they already banned LGBT to fix their lack of young labor problem and encouraging families to have 3 more children shit like this is a big problem for the elite ) </p>
<p>- they make an agreement for china to hold their part or piece of the world and never have any kind of ambition to influence other countries which there's no fucking way it's going to happen china is military and economically STRONG and it's probably going to be the next empire to rule for the next 100 years and they already started controlling some countries in africa.</p>
<p>in the end of the day gentleman  . Chinese is going to be the new English teach it to your children .</p>

        <p>I’ve been perplexed about the China-WEF relationship for awhile now, been trying to figure it out. Part of me actually thinks the WEF is a front for the CCP and that CCP is calling all the shots.</p>
<p>Edit: mainly because everything they’re proposing has been implemented in China for awhile now</p>

        <p>not all , china is banning LGBT and doesn't believe in transgender and trans-humanism that i'm quit sure off . so the elite will have problem with this when i say the elite we think only about control don't forget these guy are all belong to the same organization knights of malta , club of rome , Illuminati they all have a religion china doesn't have the religion and this a big fat problem for them . why I'm saying this ? because the elite are spending billions in middle east killing muslims &amp; trying to change Islamic teachings &amp; history even deleting anything related to god same shit for Christians . so idk if we are truly seeing the whole picture . but i really hope since the elite are many they can have conflict of interest that they destroy each other.</p>

        <p>I think it’s much simpler. Historically politicians and corporations make millions through corruption. Politicians have been selling out the US (natural resources, farmland, revenue generating toll roads, etc) to other countries, including Russia and especially China for decades. They are personally incentivized to make deals that fuck over the masses. I think we’ve reached a point where China basically owns and controls way too much at this point and optically the only way to transfer power peacefully is via bullshit organizations like the WEF.</p>

        <p>Her papers can be found in this tweet. https://twitter.com/drlimengyan1/status/1419761931926315008?s=21</p>
<p>Btw, numerous senator/congress person has spoken to her recently, and in particular, Mo Brooke released a public statement regarding her legitimacy. https://brooks.house.gov/media-center/news-releases/congressman-mo-brooks-reports-interview-dr-li-meng-yan-regarding-covid-19</p>
<p>Also just last week, Yan had a online Q&amp;A session with the house freedom caucus.</p>
<p>At the moment it seems she is in protective custody because according to herself (and another YouTube person that she first contacted) the communist party has issued commands to kill them on sight in US.</p>
