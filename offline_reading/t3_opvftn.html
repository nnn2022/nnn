    <strong>The vaccinated are spreading covid and causing variants to form more so than the unvaccinated</strong>
    <p><p>If vaccines reduce the severity of symptoms from covid and asymptomatic spread exists, then the people that are vaccinated are spreading covid more so than the unvaccinated. Not sure why someone vaccinated and without symptoms would get tested,  they go around spreading it to others unknowingly whereas if someone is unvaccinated and feels symptoms then they would be more likely to quarantine. </p>
<p>I see a lot of people blaming the rising cases, variants, and lockdown measures on those who are unvaccinated. But the truth is whether you were vaccinated or not the end game would be the same. They keep pushing back the goal posts. </p>
<p>I do believe that the vaccines can be effective in increasing your chance of not catching covid. That's not to say that there are hidden side effects though and you can still definitely catch it. But there is a possibility some of the mutations are from the virus evolving after not being able to infect the vaccinated.</p>
<p>I'm tired of the unvaccinated being at the blame of everything when these issues existed way before the vaccine did. i honestly don't have a problem with covid, it's our reaction to covid that upsets me. </p>
<p>They are trying to segregate us and make it an us for them. I have no problems with the people who get vaccinated. It's the people who try to shove it down our throats that I have a problem with and that try to blame everything on us. The more they make propaganda and make up fake stories like how people are supposedly begging for the vaccine as they're on their death bed makes me just doubt everything they say all the more. I had a similar epiphany watching reefer madness as I do seeing all of this covid bs unfold. </p>
<p>The politicians who are the strongest proponents of the lockdowns are the ones who are caught breaking their own rules. Anyway this whole situation is being blown out of proportion. The more they try to shove this down my throat the more i resist. I'm not afraid of covid but do see the media, politicians, and other influences trying to segregate us. As dystopian as it can feel at times I do have hope for things to get better and I know that there are good people out there who care.</p></p>

        <p><em>I am absolutely NOT advocating for segregation‚Ä¶ but</em> if we did, we could see which group gets sick and how. Since we‚Äôre all huddled together, it would make sense that if someone gets sick, they‚Äôd blame it on the other ‚Äúgroup‚Äù. Hopefully, they‚Äôre covering this issue in their trials though I‚Äôm doubtful.</p>

        <p>Only matter of some vaccinated nut job will use violence against someone they know didn't get the covid vaccine.  They will justify it because it will endanger their life although it's far from the truth.</p>

<p>New Health Ministry statistics indicated that, on average, the Pfizer shot ‚Äî the vaccine given to nearly all Israelis ‚Äî is now just 39% effective against infection, while being only 41% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID. Previously, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was well over 90% effective against serious illness </p>

<p>Scientists have backed proposals for Covid boosters in the autumn after blood tests on hundreds of people revealed that protective antibodies can wane substantially within weeks of second vaccine shots being given. </p>

<p>COVID VACCINES ARE FAILING TO PREVENT TRANSMISSION, MEANING THE IMMUNOCOMPROMISES WILL GET WEEDED OUT EITHER WAY, especially being that the vaccine doesnt protect them as well, </p>

<p>Not to mention how Israel is saying the 64% efficacy for the Mrna vaccine quoted 2 weeks ago seems FAR to high in regards to the delta variant, ü§îmhhhm i wonder whats making them say this?? Obviously they are seeing people that are vaccinated catch it at record high numbers </p>

<p>Also Gibraltar who is estimated to be over 90% Vaccinated are having multiple Vaccinated people catch covid, so where is herd immunity? </p>

<p>I also guess thats why 303 VACCINATED people in massachusetts were admitted to the hospital, with 79 deaths and counting </p>
