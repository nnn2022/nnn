<p>Two studies published today have found that the number of pandemic-related hospitalizations may have been dramatically over-inflated.</p>
<p>Researchers looked at data from several children’s hospitals, including the fifth-largest in the nation, and concluded that 40% of childhood hospitalizations attributed to the virus had nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>The findings may have wide-ranging implications on other pandemic-related counts and statistics.</p>
<p>The first study looked at the fifth-largest children’s hospital in the country.  It found that 58 out of the 146 positive test results (40%) in children were “incidental” in nature, meaning they had nothing to do with why the child was in the hospital.  These were children who were in the hospital for fractures, surgeries, cancer treatment, etc.  Yet they were nonetheless included in the pandemic hospitalization totals.</p>
<p>The second study looked at a children’s hospital in Northern California.  It found that 53 of the 117 positive test results (45%) were in children who were in the hospital for other reasons.  These cases were also nonetheless included in the pandemic totals. </p>
<p>The authors, Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious-diseases specialist, and Dr. Amy Beck, a professor of pediatrics, say the reason for the problem is that pandemic statistics are being taken from hospital databases that were only meant to be used for administrative purposes such as billing. “They were not designed to infer the prevalence and severity of an infectious virus.”</p>
<p>They say that their findings “underscore the importance of clearly distinguishing between children hospitalized with [the virus] versus those hospitalized for the disease.” </p>
<p>“It is critical that the risks to children be portrayed accurately,” Gandhi and Beck wrote. “Scientific and media reports that inaccurately portray the risk to children can do harm by alarming parents and providing justification for ongoing restrictions to in-person education and other programming.”</p>
<p>The inflated data continues to affect public perceptions and influence policies on schools, sports, and camp.</p>
<p>The authors also say that the issues they discovered may affect adult hospitalization rates and mortality numbers as well, and said reviews of the pandemic totals “will likely reveal the same findings across the country.”</p></p>

        <p>Right ask yourselves these questions :- 1. Would you be allowed to put a used mask that may be harbouring a deadly virus in a cardboard box if it was that deadly ? 2. Would a minimum of six flights a day from the country where this so called "Indian" variant originates be allowed to land if it was so deadly ? 3. Would you be allowed to pick up no symptom tests and do them at home yourselves if it was so deadly ? 4. Would we be allowing people to now fly all over the world packed like sardines in a tin if it were so deadly ? Depending on YOUR answers YOU can then decide for yourself how you want to proceed.........................</p>

        <p>Children have borne way too much of the COVID lockdown. First, they’re kept out of school. And now, they have to be kept in masks, while adults can take masks off?</p>
<p>And all this over a disease less deadly to children than the flu?</p>
<p>This is child abuse.</p>

        <p>I’m in favor of universal healthcare myself, but I never understood why the US government provided so much aid in paying for COVID medical bills that they don’t help pay for any other type of medical bill. What makes COVID different from any other type of medical ailment? </p>
<p>It essentially provided a motivation for hospitals to call everything COVID. Not because the hospitals really cared about the hardship of the bill on the patient, but because it was the only way the hospital could assure they would get paid.</p>

        <p>I live in Canada. My provincial tax rate + federal taxes = 54%. As a self-employed person, I need to pay another 9% into a federally mandated pension. From the remainder, I need to pay property taxes, fuel tax, 15% sales tax on basically everything. </p>
<p>If my kid gets sick, I can call the family doctor and get in in a few weeks to see him or go to a walk in clinic and wait 6 hours to be seen. My wife's last trip to ER involved her waiting in an empty ER room for nearly 7 hours while doctors walked about doing nothing and she finally left because she didn't expect to get seen. The room was empty of patients.</p>
<p>We have increased nurses by 20% in 10 years with almost no change in population and we have 4.5 times the world's per capita of nurses and we still have stories all over of folks who can't get treated.</p>
<p>I know of doctors who work night shifts in clinics that aren't open at night. They get 7 times a non-government worker's salary and they can sleep through their entire shift. They don't all do this, but the number of doctors and healthcare workers has continued to rise while the population has stayed the same as well as hospital beds. There are more doctors per bed than before, but they provide less service.</p>
<p>This is the problem with paying up front: they already have your money and now you are dependent on them for service. </p>
<p>There should definitely be public healthcare, but universal healthcare is 100% ridiculous.</p>

        <p>Here in the US, something like a third of cancer survivors end up having to file for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>But with COVID, you kept seeing stories about $100,000+ medical bills that were paid in full by the US government. Including some cases where the patient was under 65 and not eligible for Medicare.</p>
<p>When Biden became president, he took it one step further and also provided full payment for funerals of COVID victims. Paying for funerals, unlike paying for medical bills, is a completely unprecedented thing I’ve never heard of any other country in world history paying for.</p>
