    <strong>Blaze from NeEd InPuT YouTube channel - I need your help</strong>
    <p><p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>My name is Blaze, a few of you may actually know me as I had a Youtube channel called NeEd InPuT. I created it back in August of 2017 and had almost 8,000 subscribers. </p>
<p>However, yesterday YouTube deleted my channel because I did a livestream talking about how my wife’s company is wanting her vaccinated in order to travel to other countries to promote their products and attend meetings. I said my wife is not interested in the vaxx and does not want it. But if she loses her job, we are screwed financially. I also mentioned I hate wearing mask at my job, as I’m a teacher and classrooms are very hot and it’s hard to breathe.</p>
<p>Youtube claimed I was promoting misinformation and going against the WHO’s medical guidelines.</p>
<p>These assholes deleted a channel I worked hard to build up, simply because I stated my wife does not want the vaccine and her company is demanding she must have it to travel for them.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I have set up a GoGetFunded page to help my wife and I out in our situation. One option we have is to possibly bribe a doctor my wife’s Aunt knows.</p>
<p>If anyone here could promote this, possibly by posting and speaking of it on their YouTube channel or spreading over social media, it would truly help my wife and I. We really need help with funding during this crazy time.</p>

<p>I have backup channels, and as soon as I can get an iPad or PC to edit and create new videos, I am coming back strong to spread more truth.</p>
