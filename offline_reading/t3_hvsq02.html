    <strong>A very interesting article</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/covid-19-masks-on-or-off/">https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/covid-19-masks-on-or-off/</a> </p>
<p>I tend to be very skeptical about conspiracies but the more common sense and established medical consensus is suddenly turned on its head in the space of 6 weeks, the more suspicious I get.</p>
<p>For me the key paragraph is:</p>
<p><strong>...since there is a pandemic underway we are in an ideal situation to carefully record “natural experiments” on a global scale, comparing rates of infection and transmission between states at different stages of lockdown and with different masking and distancing policies.</strong> </p>
<p>What better way to get data than mandate mask wearing in certain situations, differently in some countries, varying from scenario to scenario.</p>
<p>I wish they would just be honest then those of us skeptical about mask use could simply offer to be the scientific controls and join in with the experiments, and be left alone instead of being shamed for questioning and challenging the narrative of the day.</p></p>
