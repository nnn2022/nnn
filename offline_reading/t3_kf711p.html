    <strong>ONLY COVID LIVES MATTER!</strong>
    <p><p>We're all being told we must sacrifice our jobs, our sanity, our health, our children's education, our rights, and our freedoms in an attempt to combat this public health crisis. We're told that making these sacrifices is the only morally tenable position in society because we must protect people from COVID-19. Their lives matter and they don't deserve to die of COVID. Forget the fact that most of them are 80+ years old and probably about to die of something else anyway. Does no one realize the obvious implications of what we're being told if COVID is the only public health crisis that deserves a response like this?</p>
<p>Your friend that died in a car crash? Their lives obviously don't matter as much as a COVID patient's life or else we'd be locking down the roads.</p>
<p>Your parents with diabetes or heart problems? Their lives don't matter either.</p>
<p>Cancer patients? No need to screen for or treat cancer while we have COVID to deal with! Cancer isn't a big deal anyway, COVID deserves all of our attention not cancer.</p>
<p>Your kids who have been committing suicide and overdosing on drugs at record levels? You guessed it, their lives don't matter.</p>
<p><strong>The lives of the 99% of people who die from something other than COVID don't matter</strong> if we compare and contrast our non-existent duty to save them with our new found all-encompassing sense of duty to save every COVID patient <strong>and</strong> every <strong>potential</strong> COVID patient. That's the only possible conclusion to reach with the information available to us. </p>
<p>YOUR LIFE DOESN'T MATTER UNTIL YOU GET COVID. PERIOD. <strong>ONLY</strong> COVID LIVES MATTER! If you disagree or question anything at all, you're a literal psychopath who wants people to die!</p></p>

        <p>Not to continually bring it up but did you see what these progressives did on 9/11? They kept posting "All buildings matter", meaning that saying all lives matter is the same as that.</p>
<p>They're sick. They don't care. None of this is about compassion. They're not compassionate people, if anything it's the opposite. They facilitate the ailing health of the people hit by the pandemic to leverage it for their own moral posturing.</p>

<p>There's nothing to be gained speaking out for cancer patients, or suicide victims, or those who have overdosed or been hit by a car. It cannot elevate their divine status.</p>
<p>These people are, quite literally - the least equitable when it comes to actually caring about all lives. Suicide? Fuck him, it's not covid. White man shot dead by police? Well he must have REALLY screwed up to be shot, even with all of that privilege. A joke I told with my buddy is that they're not just gender fluid - but logic fluid. It's not crystalized, logic to them is constantly changing so that they can make sense of the craziness that is spit out.</p>

        <p>Compassion without logic is extremely dangerous - not moral or good in any way.</p>

        <p>ONLY 2/587 deaths where I live are from people outside long term care homes. Last year there was 575 suicides here. Overdose deaths outnumber covid deaths 5 to 1. People need to wake the fuck up</p>

        <p>And that's why people LOVE it when they find out they're "covid positive" so they can get the attention and care they so much crave... God knows how many posts I've seen these days going "OMG I might be covid positive, I'm going to take a test now please pray for me ❤️❤️" and other hundreds of people that probably don't even like each other going " omg sending you so much love ❤️❤️"</p>
<p>Then another goes, hey I'm depressed, lost my job due to lockdowns, separated with my wife, my brother just overdosed on heroin, and people go "wtf snowflake people your age have done world war 2 without a wimp just shut up"</p>
<p>I hate social media that much, it just brings up the worst in people.</p>
