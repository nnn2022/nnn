    <strong>Autumn is NORMALLY my favorite time of year</strong>
    <p><p>Every morning I wake up, enjoying the sounds of birds singing and crisp morning air, make my coffee, yawn, stretch and all that.</p>
<p>Then I head down to the grocery store to pick up something to make for breakfast, and I am suddenly surrounded by a bunch of mindless drones with masks over their faces, frantically spraying disinfectant all over the handles of their shopping carts, and obnoxiously drifting to the far right side of the aisle when passing another human.</p>
<p>And, I sigh and grumble to myself 'ok ... we're still doing this.' Put the damn thing on my face to avoid getting publically harassed, buy my groceries and exit as quickly as I can so I can pull the damn thing off my face and suck in some much-needed oxygen.</p>
<p>How much longer are we going to keep up this ridiculous charade?</p></p>

        <p>Agree. And Halloween is my favorite holiday. My parents want to come down to visit but all the fall festivals are cancelled (that I’ve seen so far). I’m beyond sick of all this 😔</p>

        <p>I'm going to predict that news networks all across the U.S. are going to start promoting "remote trick-or-treating" or "socially distant Halloween" any day now, because they want this virus to be as obnoxiously invasive in every aspect of our lives as possible. There's no doubt in my mind that trick-or-treaters this year will be receiving face masks, CDC pamphlets and hand sanitizer instead of chocolate, snacks and candies, all in the sake of making every second of our lives bland, serious, unfun, and in subservience to a virus that will only ever seriously affect the health of people with preexisting conditions, or who are over the age of 70.</p>
<p>Scientists in the distant future are going to look at us today in the same way that we look at plague doctors in medieval Europe, who thought that the plague was spread from the stench of rotting corpses, and that aromatic incense could protect themselves from it. I don't deny the potential deadly properties of this virus to high-risk individuals, but what is being demonstrated today with this virus is bordering on superstition, devoid of scientific reason. We love to think that we're past the age of mythic thinking and sensationalist, superstitious beliefs, but we fail to recognize such beliefs today, so long as the majority of people believe in it.</p>

        <p>Good on you. That's the right attitude to have in the midst of all of this mythic thinking. I remember being told recently that we are all "inherently social creatures", and I think that statement is incredibly impactful and truthful. Without other people, we're nothing. We have no influence and our lives are miserable. We need at least one person in our lives to keep us truly human. A live spent avoiding others is not a life well lived.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope you enjoy every moment of your Halloween festivities, not in light of these mythic thinkers and their draconian quarantine guidelines, but despite them.</p>

        <p>Fucking thank you. No one wants to admit this, but we fully have not changed. Really guys, you don't think there were "scientific", "morally obvious" reasons to perform witch hunts?</p>
<p>I'm honestly at the end of my rope with people. I often get criticism from my family about my nihilist attitude towards making connections with other humans, but honestly, I think they're blaming the victim here.</p>

        <p>No shit. They already tried to ban trick or treat activities here in LA county. Then I think their legal department got involved and said you can't forbid people to leave their homes and knock on a neighbor's door. So they roled it back to "discouraged" trick or treating.</p>
<p>You know it's bad enough that we are destroying our own lives as adults. It's a whole other thing that we are robbing our kids of their childhood. Heartbreaking.</p>

        <p>Last week I got away from work for two days and did a 40 mile out-and-back overnighter. It was pretty brutal. I need to lose, like...40% off my base weight. &lt;_&lt;</p>
<p>I shoot, I hike, I run, I trail run, I bike, I do a lot of stuff outside by myself. But fuck I just want to find some fall/harvest festival where I can wander around chugging lagers, eating sausage, and watching ridiculously dressed people play ridiculous music while leaves fall out of the sky.</p>

        <p>My birthday is middle of October. I remember back in March feeling sad for my March-May birthday friends that they’d have sucky days because of this shit. Never thought I’d be lumped into that too here 7 months later. I will be having a fun house party with friends but it’s not the same as a night out at my favorite bars. I hate what they’ve done, every day I feel like they’re taking my youth away.  And on top of that the dread of a cold long winter is setting in, at least summer is happy and warm and long days, winter is depressing enough as is.</p>

My favorite bars are closed, favorite restaurants won’t let 6 of us sit together at the same table, masks...just not fun. I’m going to try and make the best of it but man this sucks.</p>

        <p>I know right. I missed doing anything for my birthday last spring because we were shut down. But now I'm starting to lose interest in doing anything <em>next</em> spring, because there's still going to be masks everywhere anyway, and it just won't be the same.</p>
<p>If I had know this year things would be so different, I would have done more for my birthday last year...</p>

        <p>October used to be one of my favorite times of year too. I loved running the pumpkin patch at work and how busy it always was, getting the whole garden center covered in mums, decorative cabbages, and Halloween decorations. Getting together with people for bonfires and scary stories, going to hike and see the fall colors, the promise of future snow on the chilly wind, all of it. Now I don't have any of that anymore, and it's beyond depressing.</p>

There’s still some things I can enjoy that don’t have to do with people like watching movies and baking but yeah going out is so depressing.

        <p>&rt; And, I sigh and grumble to myself 'ok ... we're still doing this.' Put the damn thing on my face to avoid getting publically harassed, buy my groceries and exit as quickly as I can so I can pull the damn thing off my face and suck in some much-needed oxygen.</p>
<p>Probably half the people you see are just doing the same thing. Try not wearing one. I've been going without for about a month, nobody says anything, nobody cares. Maybe I get the stinkeye or something but I don't look at other people that much so I don't notice.</p>
<p>And the town I do my groceries in has a mask ordinance, it doesn't matter, nobody says anything and nothing happens. Even if they did the first offense is a warning, subsequently a $10 fine. I kind of want at least one fine so I can frame it and put it on my wall.</p>

        <p>I agree. And I'm in Florida and thought things were getting better here lately, especially with the removal of capacity limits and fines, but today I just don't feel that way. Maybe combined with the ugly, rather dreary weather we've been having the last few days, but yesterday and today it felt like we took 5 steps back with regards to normalcy. I saw <em>more</em> people wearing masks in stores than normal, it seemed, and places that weren't pushing it the last couple months, seem to be back at it, with signs up and almost everyone wearing one.</p>
<p>I went to a store yesterday and the cashier was telling people to please stand back after they put their items on the counter. They wear masks, gloves and wipe the counter after every customer. They're the only store around here I see doing the last two things. Gloves are completely useless unless they change them after every customer. They spread just as well as bare hands. I don't even get why they waste the money on them.</p>
<p>The thrift stores around here seem to be the worst with regard to masks. Two of them will throw anyone out that they see with no mask on. I heard a lady say yesterday at one, to the people she was with, "let's go, they're kicking us out."</p>

        <p>We’re definitely going trick or treating this year. My 3 year old has been “practicing” around the house and it’s my daughter’s first Halloween. I’m in Florida and everyone is pretty much over it here. Hopefully a lot of people will participate. I really just hope my son doesn’t get his heart broken.</p>
