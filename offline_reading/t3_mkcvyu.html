    <strong>Consolidate?</strong>
    <p><p>Think of it like a court case in a movie. You watched the movie. At the start of the film, you love some of the characters, you hate some. By the time the court is in session, you know who's guilty and who's not, but the court has to go through motions. Not to mention it'd be a dull movie. </p>
<p>Obviously this is life, not the movies, and we're all affected by it. We're all in it. I find simple beauty in this idea, like a flower growing in concrete. </p>
<p>But I think we need to compile the data. I had a conversation with a gentleman (argued with an internet stranger) and, well... he beat the shit out of me. Guys I had read over the information. Articles upon articles, websites, news stations, mainstream, alternative. This man is in his 50s and has hypertension. He brought up the survival rate, and he has a 15.0900% chance of dying if he catches covid.</p>
<p>Now, from different angles, one could argue that the death toll is way off, meaning the survival rate is off. One could argue that covid is no more dangerous than the flu, so a chart with flu survival rates next to covid survival rates would be nice. This argument would spiral into whether it's a good thing to have mandates because we'd be helping with other things than covid. </p>
<p>My main point is I think we should come up with a FAQ on every rebuttal to our stance. I don't want to win arguments. I even told the guy he wins, because I didn't know what to say. My dad is in his 50s and has hypertension, beat cancer too. On paper he is the most susceptible. I don't think he's any worse, but I don't want to be cold about this because of what I dig. I want to do more research, and I guess I'm asking for help? </p>
<p>There's a bunch of posts here with a ton of information, and a lot of the comments I read here dive into the sources. I feel like there's a healthy level of skepticism of each other here to really be like scientists here and draw up some badass ideas. Whatcha'll think?</p></p>

        <p>I am going to dig through my saved links and see what I can surface for you. But in the meantime, here’s some maybe useless, maybe helpful, anecdotal experience from me, a complete stranger on Reddit:) Take it as you will. </p>
<p>This is my dad’s experience with Covid, a 62 year old lifelong smoker, alcoholic and opiate user, with hypertension, cirrhosis of the liver, and diverticulitis, causing him to lose part of his large intestine a few years ago. </p>
<p>In April 2019(early pandemic) my dad was brought to the hospital(Austin, TX) dehydrated, delirious, angry, scared, and all alone. They suspected opiate withdrawal. Within 12 hours he had tested positive for Covid, and within 24 hours he was tied to a bed by his wrists and ankles, intubated, fully isolated, in and and out of consciousness, with no familiar face to comfort him and no power of attorney present to advocate his care. It took us over a week to convince a nurse to simply hold a phone up to his ear to tell him we loved him and to offer a familiar voice to reassure him he was ok. My older sister had established POA within 12 hours of his hospitalization. My dad was taken in for confusion and dehydration, so he was not in a cognitive state to make decisions for himself, and yet he was put on a ventilator without POA consent. At this point in time, concerns of ventilators causing more problems in Covid patients were being discussed, but not confirmed. Bi pap and c pap machines were deemed unsafe to use with Covid patients because of the air flow exposure. They gave my dad a dose of hydroxychloroquine(it hadn’t come under scrutiny yet), after the 3 day dose, he wasn’t given anything else aside from blood pressure medicine and an antacid. Texas hospitals aren’t allowed to administer anything without FDA approval and nothing had been approved yet. So my dad laid in a hospital bed, with a tube down his throat, tied to his bed, completely alone, for weeks. He would have a couple hours of human interaction in a day when nurses and doctors would come in to care for him. This was done as a coordinated approach when care could be done with minimal entrances into a Covid room. Medical staff had to gown up/down between entry/exit to his room and there simply wasn’t time in a day to do that every time a Covid patient needed something. My dad survived. Thank God. But he carries life long side effects. Not the ones we hear on the news about being a “long hauler”. His most life altering side effect from the Covid virus was the PTSD he now has from  memories of crying and begging doctors and nurses to come help him, or at least explain to him when he would wake up scared wondering where he was, why he was tied to a bed, and all alone. He could see the nurses in the hall turn their back on him through his room window when they heard him call. When his mind started coming back to him, he realizes that when he grabbed his equipment cords with his tied up hand, and yanked on it hard enough, it would make the machines beep, making it so someone had to come in to make it stop. While I give my dad serious props for his stubborn ass ingenuity, it shatters my heart to think of how awful his time there was. The trauma he experienced as well as the devastation my family experienced is hard to define. Here we are at the one year mark of it, and my mind still wrestles with it all.</p>
<p>Here’s my point, yes, Covid can be deadly. People in high risk groups should take extra Vitamin D, soak up as much fresh air and sunshine as climate allows, and age old wisdom of diet and exercise. I need to follow this advice myself ;) ha! But in all seriousness, watching someone as unhealthy as my dad push through something like that  definitely showed me it’s not a guaranteed killer. I have had several  other 60+ year old fairly unhealthy family members get it and pull through well. They said it was definitely one of the worst sicknesses they can recently remember, but none have been “long haulers”. My dad is the only person I know in real life who has long term damage. And it was not from the virus.  My dad lived, but he get to carry the weight of his traumatic experience due to the misinformed, confused, terrified and already overwhelmed medical establishment. The Covid mandates are, in my opinion, the elephant in the room consequence of Covid.</p>
