    <strong>We have seen this before</strong>
    <p><p>During WW2 the US government curtailed free speech rights and interned Americans of certain ethnic backgrounds, most Americans didn't oppose this partially do to the lack of information at the time and the fear of Japan and Germany, now it is widely understood that these actions were horrific and short sighted.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In the early 60s the US became involved in the Vietnam war, most Americans accepted the idea of a draft because of fear of communism and naive trust in their government, now it is widely understood that the Vietnam war was a failure that lead to the unnecessary deaths of both Americans and Vietnamese civilians.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>During the 80s the war on drugs was in full swing, with many Americans giving up their rights because they feared the increased use of drugs like marijuana, now it is widely understood that marijuana is one of the least dangerous drugs and is mostly just used to put innocent people in prison.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In the early 2000s the fear of terror in the wake of the 9/11 attacks made many Americans allow  their freedoms to be taken away so they could have a false sense of security, now it is widely understood that the Patriot Act and other measures were a gross violation of civil liberties and did next to nothing to fight terror.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In the early 2020s the fear of covid-19 caused many Americans to willingly give up their rights to prevent the spread of diseases that they believed were much more deadly than they actually were.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>None of this is new, it is just the wave of mass hysteria and gross violations of civil rights that appears about every 20 years.</p></p>

        <p>There were a LOT of Vietnam war protests. You painted that one with a broad brush. One of my college professors said that the news showing war footage also turned the public against the war. Television was a new medium to broadcast war news. The draft was still in place since WWII. </p>
<p>The other examples are good. The patriot act was discussed in the media at the time. It is a huge law and the ramifications were not completely understood. I don’t know if air travel restrictions were in the law or the TSA just came up with them on their own. Air travel used to be so much easier.</p>

        <p>Conspiracy theory? Forcing a society to halt because of a virus that we now know is virtually harmless if your heathy and under 60. I agree we can put measures in-place for at-risk people without crippling the rest of society by dehumanizing it with masks and ~~social distancing~~ isolation. </p>
<p>With plenty of sources that support masks, there are also plenty of data that shows we have <strong><em>no idea</em></strong> of the efficacy of masks in a public setting, especially if the mask user isn’t following the required steps of sanitizing, not touching one’s face, washing, etc. <a href="https://jennifermargulis.net/cdc-mask-wearing-policy-not-supported-by-science/">(1)</a></p>
<p>We now have medical professionals that are signing an open letter from Belgium healthcare workers to end the authoritarian measures enacted by governments, including wearing masks <a href="https://www.aier.org/article/open-letter-from-medical-doctors-and-health-professionals-to-all-belgian-authorities-and-all-belgian-media/amp/">(2)</a>...are <strong><em>all</em></strong> of these people wrong?  I do think that the “medical professionals” people describe are not experts in mental health or societal issues generally. Do you think the virologist who studies [terrifying] viruses all day considered the impact of the mental health of a population by dehumanizing them with masks?  </p>
<p>And while we’re at it, I haven’t even began to touch the long-term impact of children fearing the general public because <em>people they don’t know personally are effectively lepers...</em> And yes, there is science that ties children decoding facial expressions as a measure of success and social competence, so masking society will impact their development as well <a href="https://www.parentingscience.com/facial-expressions-for-kids.html">(3)</a></p>
<p>My meta-point is that our world is complex, and sometimes one answer doesn’t fit, so I’m just going to agree to disagree. </p>
<p>Personal safety is...<strong><em>personal</em></strong>. I’m fine if you think you should wear a mask - you just have no right to tell me otherwise.</p>
