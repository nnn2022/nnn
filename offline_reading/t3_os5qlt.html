    <strong>The cognitive dissonance is through the roof</strong>
    <p><p>Purely anecdotal, but thought I'd share my first-hand experiences with friends / people who have been vaccinated, and people I know IRL who have allegedly caught covid (I say allegedly as I haven't seen any evidence of this virus being isolated anywhere). </p>
<p>Out of my 1185 "friends" on facebook, and all the people I work with / live with / know personally - I haven't heard of a SINGLE person who has had any remotely serious complications due to covid-19. This includes my parents and their friends who are in their late 60's.</p>
<p>Quite a few people have complained about getting "really ill" at the end of last year and attributed it covid. Also plenty of people I know got the sniffles, got tested, and came back with a positive test (some of whom insisted I should isolate because of their test result).</p>
<p>I do however know DOZENS of people who are experiencing long term vaccine side-effects:</p>
<p>My GF's mother and sister both complained of intense pins and needles /  burning hands and feet / numbness (neuropathy). The sister already had issues with DVT but was urged to get the AZ shot here in the UK. It still affects them now.</p>
<p>One work colleague has told me he's been experiencing extreme fatigue / heavy chest for 2+ months after getting the gene therapy.</p>
<p>Another colleague told me she's had daily headaches / brain fog for well over a month after her 2nd jab.</p>
<p>A guy I met on the tube last night said the same - perfectly healthy before, now has daily headaches and can't finish his regular workout regime.</p>
<p>This plus 10 or so people complaining on my facebook feed about long term chest/head pain / fatigue after one or two jabs.</p>
<p>And the icing on the cake was a friend of my Dads who passed away a few weeks ago. He said the official cause of death was "complications due to long covid".  I asked him if she'd taken the "vaccine". His face went blank for a second and then glazed over - "No, she hadn't taken it" was his response. </p>
<p>I knew he was lying and trying not to make the connection, so I went to her facebook profile and there was a comment she'd made about her first jab appointment coming up.</p>
<p>All of these people simply cannot think about the possibility of the vaccine causing any health problems. They cannot in their heads make any connection to it as it would shatter their little bubbles and world views. I considered my Dad an open-minded guy, he entertains all the 9/11 stuff I share with him etc. but seeing his face glaze over like that after he realised what was happening said it all to me. </p>
<p>Their cognitive dissonance will not let them accept what is happening, let alone allow them any ideas of a concerted global effort to depopulate or whatever their reasons are for forcing this gene therapy on every single person on the planet.</p></p>

        <p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Vax + You = Side effects.</p>
<p>But but but that formula d-d-doesn't make sense, uh hyuck.</p>
<p>Well...u didn't have side effects until the vax. Therefore, the vax is responsible for ur side effects. </p>
<p>Food poisoning? Well then u ate a poison. No ifs, ands or buts about it. How else do u get food poisoning without eating something poisonous??</p>
<p>Cognitive dissonance in action like Jackson.</p>

        <p>It’s funny you mention food poisoning. Nearly every person I know has gotten a stomachache of sorts and immediately blamed it on something they ate, claiming food poisoning. In reality, it rarely was. But they’re so quick to blame their lunch..meanwhile they’re quick to dismiss the side effects of a vaccine.</p>

        <p>I've gotten food poisoning eating sushi in the past and knew it soon as I got home when my stomach began hurting and many trips to relieve myself. </p>
<p>Also have eaten too-rare steak and gotten sick along with chicken that ended up not being properly cooked. This was stomach-holding pain and my hand stayed rubbing my stomach to help it settle down.</p>

        <p>I am experiencing the exact same thing. I know of one death from Covid, it was a friends cousin. He had a lot of comorbidities and a drug problem. Other then that it was like the flu/a cold. My nephew did have long Covid, had a migraine for months. Ended up hospitalized over it, but it fine now. The adverse reactions in seeing to the vax are unreal though (and nobody makes the connection). One of the weirder ones I’ve notice it broken blood vessels in the eye? Seen 3 coworkers get that post jab. Lots of headaches and migraines, lots of them are sick in July. Nerve pain, sciatica, menstrual issues, all came on post jab.</p>

        <p>Someone I know has broken out in a rash covering his entire torso and back since his jab. He isn't in any discomfort from it but oddly it has remained covering his skin ever since.</p>

        <p>This is what I don't get. I know what I would consider to be a lot of people who have had bad vaccine side effects, so surely <em>everyone</em> does? I'm not even a bloke who knows that many people! </p>
<p>And if they do know people like I do, why did they go and get theirs and dismiss the notion of potential side effects? </p>
<ol>
<li>Astrazeneca (AZ) - uncle got black eye and had a brain scan. Came back clear. His wife had incredibly high blood pressure and heart rate. Higher than when I'd neck ecstasy like sweets back in the day. Yet the doc said it was anxiety... Her blood pressure remains high weeks later. </li>
<li>AZ - bloke across the road had black eye, brain scan (clear) and his wife has had a sometimes painful, sometimes dead arm for weeks. Doc doesn't know why. </li>
<li>AZ - uncle had suicidal ideology and terrible headaches. Didn't see a doc. </li>
<li>Pfizer - three women at wife's work had menstrual issues. Blood tests came back clear for all. One was anaemic due to the loss of blood.</li>
<li>AZ - old guy I see on dog walks didn't give a fuck about covid (he gives zero fucks about anything tbf!) but got the shot anyway and his fingers went painful and chalk white for 48 hours. He didn't see a doc. I don't think he'd see a doc if his dick dropped off... I'm shocked he got the vaccine. </li>
<li>Pfizer - My mom's mate is one of the few older folk in the UK that had the Pfizer. She was very pro vaccine but has had continuous minor nerve issues like tingling, numbness, pins and needles all over, etc since 4 weeks post second injection. She has not yet gone to her GP but is blaming the vaccine for it now. Her tune has changed big time. </li>
</ol>
<p>That's nine I know of and I'd consider that a lot. </p>
<p>Now for my Covid experiences - my mates parents and brother were all hospitalised with it. Everyone else I know has had it mild. But I only know six people I can think of who have tested positive for it apart from them.</p>
