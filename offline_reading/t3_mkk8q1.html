        <p>They are working with the information that is given to them.</p>
<p>The virus ain't going anywhere by itself, and the politicians are probably keeping these restrictions until they have done all that can be done. When almost everyone is fully vaccinated the restrictions will definely get loosened. They know that we can't keep living like this, and they are humans like us too.</p>

        <p>Sweden tried to stay without restrictions, but then they regretted it when a lot of people had died. Over a hundred people dying every day at peak, and people didn't know how long it would last (and still don't know for sure).</p>

        <p>Sweden actually looks very good according to statistics.</p>
<p>Sweden is also the proof that corona cases are not correlated to the measures that are being taken.</p>
<p>So, the measures that are taken by states are related to something else.</p>

        <p>The thing is that no one know what is the right course of action. Every country has different cultures and people.</p>
<p>The politicans, their friends and relatives still live the same lives as the rest of us. All these restricions and effects of this pandemic also affects them. Their children go to the same schools and they themselves go to the same grocery stores as everyone else. I obviously don't believe in any conspiraries.</p>
<p>My country has also had some weird restrictions that don't really make much sense, but I know they can't do everything with a lot of research and investigation. Stuff like "hmm I wonder how safe is this specific event in this one specific school."</p>
<p>These restrictions have taken many things from my life, but as my grandpa said, people dying is not fun either. The main goal of most governments is to keep everyone healthy.</p>

        <p>It’s actually possible to hate and distrust the government and also understand basic science. Yeah, the government wants you to wear masks, because dead people can’t pay taxes. It’s not about “control” like what does the govt materially GAIN from everyone wearing masks and getting vaxxed, other than their population being more healthy?</p>

        <p>Dead old people don't receive social security.</p>
<p>And companies make more money (selling masks and vaccines).</p>
<p>And governments can powergrab so the cattle can be controlled better.</p>
<p>And even though the mortality rate is 0.1% and the poeple are suffering (jobless ones, the ones that have other ilnesses, etc.) it's okay, because everything is for our own good: the authoritarianism is for our own good, the house arrest is for our own good, the experimental vaccine ia for our own good.</p>
