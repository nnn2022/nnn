    <strong>Future job searches</strong>
    <p><p>Obviously with the looming vaccine FDA approval and the assumed wave of vaccine mandates to follow, a bunch of us will be faced with the decision of quitting our jobs.  I've been thinking a lot about this as I work at a local courthouse and fear it is only a matter of time before they get there under public pressure. Is there a resource out there that would help someone find jobs that do not/will not require vaccinations? I realize we are probably still a little early on this but it seems like it's going to be very important for people to be able to search for jobs that are not complying with these ridiculous mandates. Someone should work on setting like this up if there isn't already. I'm simply not skilled enough but I would personally love to benefit from a resource like this if anyone feels called to take the reins.</p></p>

        <p>I'm facing this right now. State workers in WA are forced to get the vaccine by mid October. A lot can happen between now and then, but if it goes through I will not comply and they will have to fire me. I really don't know where I'm going to work after this. I had the virus already why can't we prove natural immunity? This whole thing is mind boggling.</p>
