        <p>Bill Gates said the next virus will get our attention, in a 2020 interview. </p>
<p>https://youtu.be/phTeKz6kPUQ</p>
<p>Hopefully those who run the world won’t decide that it’s time to end the theater. But honestly I don’t care at this point. I’d rather die than live in a totalitarian nightmare. No, not live, survive, extend my time in the earth while experiencing a fearful repetitive restrictive life. So I think it’s time for all of us to do less worrying.</p>

        <p>That’s what worries me the most. </p>
<p>If you don’t think by yourself there’s nothing stopping these sick fucks from engineering the next plague. </p>
<p>And you’ll read headlines. “Super virus spreading”. And you’ll say “Oh jeez, this shit again” and you’ll draw no conclusions of your own. But this time it’s not a mild cough because their objective is no longer to control the few sheep. It’s to get rid of you, the non compliant. So there you go, running around. No mask, getting together with whomever you please, calling out this facade. But this time it’s a real thing. With a real mortality index. </p>
<p>And you, and your macho, defiant attitude gets you killed or crippled. </p>
<p>Who is left? The sheep they trained this time around to wear masks, get anal swabs, “work” from home, and consume plastic bullshit to try to fill the hole in their souls. </p>
<p>And there’s no one left to fight back because they didn’t think.</p>

        <p>If a virus is so deadly and contagious that my immune system+vitamins and rest cannot handle it, then the virus won’t spread. A real killer kills so many people so quickly it wipes itself out if existence. Ebola is an example of that. The only way that this could be maintained is the government continues spraying the engineering virus all over the place. Shipping it in food, putting it in water the whole deal. If that were to be the case humanity would be wiped out. </p>
<p>Thinking a ton about these Armageddon scenarios causes undo stress, because they’re Armageddon scenarios. There is no solution in that case, the only thing to fear is fear itself. Maybe you’re talking about dialing up the virus a notch but not too much, hitting the sweet spot in terms of being deadly enough to kill many, but not deadly enough that it won’t spread. Fortunately these kinds of things exist already in  where I lived before, Africa, so I understand the mindset of living with a fair risk of mortality. I got malaria and couldn’t walk for several days, had to sleep with an IV drip in my arm, could have been curtains for me. My nephew unfortunately passed away from a flu. We’ve lived with these kinds of diseases throughout history, and totalitarian governments won’t be able to get rid of dissidents through a virus alone. They’ll ultimately have to kill us directly. </p>
<p>Critical thinking is important and the more I think about the super-virus possibility, the more I believe it would be a very controlled operation rather than a doomsday scenario. Since a doomsday scenario could very well wipe out the elites themselves. The way to bring this out in a controlled manner is to make us weaker, not the virus stronger. Which is what they are already doing with the garbage in our food, water, and environment. I feel the “vaccine” may be a big proponent in this hence why they want to give it out so often, and why it makes so many people sick immediately after taking it. So right now we do have situations to fight back against, to prevent any extreme situations which cause anxiety to think about. I feel our energy is best focused on fighting what we have now rather than being afraid of what could be. We won’t even have to cross that bridge when we come to it if we prevent any such scenario from ever occurring. </p>
<p>Peace, and I hope you’ve dealt with this anxiety thing because that’s what these criminals are trying to play with right now. We are living through psychological warfare.</p>

        <p>You tortured yourself and your family for nothing.  We are not contrary to your right to do so; we are contrary to the ability of the unholy trio of politicians, the MSM, and big tech to whip much of humanity into that state of irrational fear, and impose illusory control measures without regard to the consequences.  </p>
<p>The trio just fleeced humanity of trillions of dollars--probably upwards of $10-$15 trillion--and made arbitrary decisions about who would benefit.  The greatest wealth transfer in human history.</p>
<p>If you are not contrary to that, you are a nihilist.  Safety without liberty is not safety, it's tyranny.  Living in fear is not living.  Humans evolved with complex immune systems that will allow the vast majority of mankind to survive any virus, even a novel one.  Yet you discount hundreds of thousands of years of evolution because the news told you to be afraid.  </p>
<p>Pathetic.</p>

        <p>You didn't read his whole post, he said that he was paranoid (and rightly so, everyone in their right mind was afraid of catching covid in the first couple of months before we received statistics and realized this was a huge scam) and realized that he was wrong. That's very noble of one to admit one's wrongs, I don't know a lot of people who would drop their pride for a second and admit that they made a mistake.</p>

        <p>Did you read my post or did you just quit half way through because you were too busy circlejerking about a restaurant putting up a sign that they don’t require masks? </p>
<p>I did what I did based on the information I had and the conclusions I arrived at when the news where saying “this is nothing to worry about” and “there is no need to wear masks”. I did what everything should have done and be doing: based on the information I had I took the path I -not the news, not some dimwit with a bought and paid for bureaucrat- chose to be the right one. Periodically, I adjusted my paradigm to what was happening. </p>
<p>Your aggressive posturing, immature and unfounded, it’s in no way different to that of some pink haired, half shaved masked fool begging to suppress thanksgiving family get togethers while cheering on the BLM protests.</p>

        <p>Think about it this way: you are in a restaurant. You smell smoke. You hear alarms going off. Someone is going around yelling fire. </p>
<p>I get my family out and then realize some asshole left a pan on the broiler way too long on and it smoked up the joint. So, I go back in and finish my meal. Sure. I had a momentary bad time but with the available information I did what I considered right. I didn’t trust the guy yelling fire. I smelled the smoke and heard the alarms myself. I might have over reacted and will keep it in mind. </p>
<p>You, on the other hand are an alpha male right? You hear the smoke detectors and see people running out. You smell the smoke but you’ll be damned if a little bit of smoke is going to let your carbonara get cold. Sadly, this time, the owner wanted the place burned down to a crisp for the insurance money. You get third degree burns and one of your kids die. But at least you can be proud that you stood your ground, just in case the smoke alarms were triggered on purpose.</p>
