    <strong>Im leaving this sub now</strong>
    <p><p>I joined NNN a bit ago because its overall message was composed of more honest news about stuff going on in the pandemic world, not memes. Now it seems like another facebook joke page that ultimately functions as just another strawman for what is an honest, frank message that has nothing to do with comedy. Memes are really nothing but a low tier, low IQ version of symbolism for the masses to have communion with. In fact, it almost seems like this subreddit is becoming an informational conglomerate that represents a clown; upside down compared to "the normal" or what is perceived to be "the way". I bet many of the people following this subreddit are actually laughing at its existence, as history repeats itself once again, hopefully for the last time. The question is, who is aktually the clown parade?</p></p>

        <p>I truly understand and agree with the points your making but we all need to laugh a little bit and not take life so seriously at times. The problem is that there are not many places for like-minded people to communicate so there arenâ€™t many other options, especially on Reddit. There is still a ton of good information between the memes lol</p>
