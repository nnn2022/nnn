    <strong>This is not about whether we believe in the pandemic or not!</strong>
    <p><p>Many have noted that this place is flowing with low vibration energy. Becoming all paranoid and angry about the great reset or whatnot is the same as being a doomer. The negative energy, it is the same on both sides. The paranoia and the conspiracies are just as bad as the virus paranoia. The forces of evil don't want you to believe in the pandemic, they want you to be scared and angry. It's about spreading negative energy, and both sides are engaging in that. They don't care why you go mad, as long as you go mad. Trauma wants to spread itself, and it uses every trick. Don't fall for it. The "us versus them" mentality, the disintegration of order and nicety. That's what it's really about. That's how evil wins. Love thy enemy. Turn the other cheek. That's how we win this. This isn't about religion, but you would be better served to read the bible than this place. It's about the energy you put into you. That there are people who want a great reset might well be true, and the people who want mask mandates are their useful idiots. But they have no power, they need to psych you out to win. But they are ultimately powerless. There are few of them. They can only win by turning us against ourselves. They are like schizophrenic voices in your head, if you don't listen to them, they can't hurt you. But if you do listen to them, they can make you kill your family. So being right is not the solution. Keep being a skeptic, but remember that your first objective in this is to be a nice person and make the world a better place. That's how we win. I don't know what the answer is. I have serious doubts whether there even is a novel virus. But this place isn't good for anyone's mental health. I'm outta here.</p>
