    <strong>Why vaccination efforts are failing in the entire planet</strong>
    <p><p>I understand most people here have not vaxxed and a significant group do not think of covid as something major. And there are some points that make that claim somewhat valid: covid is not the Black Death, not even the Spanish flu of the late 1910’s. Most people affected by covid consist of people who succumb to similar diseases and have died in the past from them like influenza. And the vast majority of those who get covid, unvaxxed, do not end up in a hospital. </p>
<p>Still, both the media and significant group of charlatan health “experts” insist on scaring and panicking people with the delta variant, insist that vaxxed people wear masks and social distance and in general, do not want any change in terms of precautions before or after getting the jabs. They show data that certify vaccines do bring hospitalizations and deaths down, but at the same time they tell you “even vaccinated you can still catch and spread the virus”. The contradictions prevail and reasonably they do not invite undecided people to get the jabs and strengthen the anti-vaxxers’ refusal to get the jabs. As a consequence the vaccination rate all over the world is stagnant. Australia, where the government stubbornly insists in failed draconian measures to deal with the virus, full vaccination is almost zero. Probably because Australians see it pointless to get a vaccine if they are kept imprisoned in their homes.</p></p>

        <p>what they want is to keep the lock down on forever + profiting from continues vaccines booster which they want to give each year the problem with this logic is that it's LOAD of BULLSHIT.  you can't literally have both control and money this way at the same time they tried to combine that and failed . no sane person will keep taking the vaccine for no reason because eventually they can lie once twice but the lies keep piling up  until they start contradicted itself then BOOM people rise up . if the pandemic failed then vaccines failed and vaccine passport failed and the whole thing collapsed literally what they spent YEARS planing failed in matter of couple of a year .  they can't keep the narrative alive i don't see these guy ever succeeding and doing what china did all system are doomed to fail at some point that the rule of this universe.</p>

        <p>I agree. 1984 is scary but it's no more likely than the world war Z  to actually happen. The media is lying about EVERYTHING they sugar coat some stuff and exaggerate other stuff seemingly arbitrarily just to keep everyone distracted, fearful and depressed. There's nothing new under the sun.</p>

        <p>Because you might not even get covid, and if you do it’s asymptomatic most of the time and a even smaller chance of symptoms which is basically a cold/runny nose. And afterwards you have natural immunity. </p>
<p>With the covid jab you can still catch covid AND also get a small % of terrible side effects like stroke, blood clot, fluid around heart, a plethora of heart complications, Bell’s palsy, nerve issue, fainting, and other issues. And we dont know the long term effects either because its a novel experimental gene therapy mrna jab</p>
<p>Take ur pick. I will keep my body natural, natural immunity, and non gmo</p>

        <p>I think it’s about destroying women’s fertility and controlling who gets to have kids i.e “civilized” genetic selection.  The overwhelming amount of complaints have come specifically about severe menstrual issues</p>
<p>And yes it’s been an outstanding success thus far but i see it collapsing soon.  We’re in some sort of vaccine Weimar Republic.  It will probably be followed by an authoritarian system</p>
