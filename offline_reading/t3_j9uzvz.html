    <strong>What can we do about idiots who discredit our movement by coming up with total rubbish?</strong>
    <p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>I've just spoken to a rather interesting lady who agrees with us; opposes mask mandates, doesn't agree with lockdowns. Her own theory about why they exist however is...interesting. Apparently, countries in europe are all sacrificing their economies...to help out Greece. Sorry, for those at the back I'll repeat: all this action has been done, so many lives have been ruined...to help out Greece. I don't know how that works, whether it's because spain and a few other european countries now have less tourism than Greece, but that's the theory.</p>
<p>Obviously this is complete and utter bullshit. It is, however, the sort of bullshit that enables the mainstream media to point everyone who is skeptical of lockdowns as nutty conspiracy theorists, because generally nutty conspiracy theorists talk loudly and get a lot of attention. Is there anything we can do to present a view in the media that makes total sense but still opposes lockdowns? In a time when the science is being completely ignored in support of an over-cautious agenda, we can't be allowing ourselves to get sidetracked by people who think covid is caused by 5g or is designed to help out Greece.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p></p>

        <p>Nothing. free speech is the antidote to censorship. And since the official story is complete rubbish, people are going to come up with all kinds of alternative theories, and that's ok. The world is a complex place.</p>

        <p>I have found ignoring everything around me to be extremely effective. My wife and I have resorted to acting as if we and other person like us are the only ones roaming the earth, for the most part.</p>
<p>We don't break laws. We are respectful to anyone we have to interact with but,  we just ignore the bullshit.</p>
<p>Engaging is no longer worth it. Its a waste of time and energy at this point. It adds to the disruption. We don't allow our lives to be disrupted anymore.</p>
<p>I feel if more people would do this, things would change a bit. The arguments and fights have become a sport to many people. They seek out their next opponent and fire up the confrontation. They celebrate their wins over on r/coronavirus with their teammates.</p>
<p>Don't engage anymore. Don't break the law. Respect other people. But, ignore all the bullshit. We have to create our own little life right now to make virus lovers and even elected officials realize they are not needed. They can do their thing and we can do ours. We will be just fine without them.</p>

        <p>And the 'there's no coin shortage' people. I've worked in retail since before March, people just aren't using cash as much (for BS reasons, but that's not the point), and the banks either aren't meeting or are unable to meet the demands of every business that accepts cash payments. I don't want to ask every customer for exact change, but I'm not going to get my ass chewed out for not giving back exact change I may not have.</p>

        <p>The best thing you can do is respectfully but very clearly disassociate with those arguments if they come up. </p>
<p>Beyond that, consistently be civil, rational, and evidence-based in all comments on the topic. Itâ€™s super easy to write off the angry person spewing insults as a nutjob, but much harder to write off the person who comes across as educated and intelligent. Bonus points for keeping your cool with a doomer who is going off the rails - that contrast makes you and your argument look great. So resist the temptation to reciprocate bad behavior. </p>
<p>Finally, remember that the person youâ€™re talking to is just one person, and not important; youâ€™re writing to slowly persuade the many lurkers out there who read your comments.</p>

        <p>As bad as Americans who think the whole world, all these countries, have destroyed their economies and destroyed their people because of the American election and the fact they don't like Trump ðŸ¤£</p>
<p>But people should always be able to voice their beliefs like that, being silenced isn't okay. We should know with how we have been silenced. I would suggest trying to reason with them but they tend to be headstrong about their beliefs in trying to explain this nonsensical hell. </p>
<p>I am also sick of the media worldwide grasping at the minority against all of this who hold those sorts of beliefs to paint us as crazy. Not much we can do about that unfortunately except to keep trying to speak ourselves.</p>
<p>It's understandable people come up with these ideas though, considering what has been done. Had someone told me last year this would happen I would have never believed them, so people will come up with wild ideas to explain it.</p>
