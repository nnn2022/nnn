    <strong>COVID isn't deadly anymore</strong>
    <p><p>I'm so tired of the media narrative on what's happening with the "Delta Spike" and how seemingly everyone buys into it without a basic examination of the facts.</p>
<p>Here's what's happening from a rational, fact-based perspective and it's almost all good news:</p>
<p>1) The case spike we're having right now corresponds exactly with the timing of a case spike last summer.</p>
<p>2) The reason we have this summer case spike each year is largely due to the fact that COVID only spreads indoors and when the temperature spikes in early July in Southern states, everyone hides inside in recirculating air and spreads the virus (look at cases maps, it's all in states experiencing extreme heat). They also don't have adequate Vitamin D from lack of sun exposure in these areas, which exacerbates the problem. Finally, particularly this year, letting in a bunch of migrant workers and illegal immigrants from 3rd World Countries isn't a great idea for stopping respiratory virus transmission. </p>
<p>3) Here comes the great news - the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) on July 28th of 2020 was 1.4% (1000 deaths in 68,178 cases). The CFR yesterday (7/28/21) was 0.4% (303 deaths in 67,293 cases). This means the case fatality rate is down 70% due to some combination of vaccinating the elderly, better treatment and the Delta Variant being less deadly. This is great news, but you'd never hear it in the media.</p>
<p>4) More good news - Assuming 5 infections for every 1 positive test (which is on the light side, I've seen estimates as high as 10), the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) is now at .08% which is less deadly than a standard flu season and significantly less deadly than bad flu seasons which can range up to .2% IFR. </p>
<p>Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic is over and we need to push back HARD against any further masking, vaccine or lockdown mandates with facts. No conspiracy theories, no anger, just hard facts using their data. This is how we win - use their numbers against them. </p>

        <p>Can covid be deadly? Yes. Can drinking too much water at once be deadly? Yes. </p>
<p>Anything can be deadly if you try hard enough. People need to chill out about this virus now. It's more of a pain in the ass than a rider on a pale horse.</p>

        <p>I'm a healthy younger man and I almost died. I won the covid genetic lottery and it did a weird clotting thing to my blood. This thing affects every person differently and there was such a huge range of what it can do. It's such a crapshoot. These Spike proteins are just so fucky, we shouldn't be messing around with them. </p>
<p>Luckily for us the Delta is 19x less deadly.</p>

        <p>Exactly. It's now less deadly than the flu. We don't ruin our lives and cover the faces of our children for the flu. Enough is enough.</p>
