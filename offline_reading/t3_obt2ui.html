    <strong>You asked us to be patient during the lockdowns. Well, I'll take my sweet time with "getting" the "vaccine" then. YOU be fucking patient.</strong>
    <p><p>I love how these basement dwelling dip-shits preached on and on about patience being a virtue during the lockdowns, how we just needed to stay inside for two weeks and wait it out, how every time the fucking goalposts moved again and again that we just needed to relax and that it was our fault for not being patient enough, how we just couldn't keep our impulses in-check long enough to ride out the wave and fLaTtEn dA cUrVe... yet as soon as this new experimental "vaccine" is shat out onto the market like a Christmas rushed game developed by Gearbox Software it's fucking GO GO GO!!!</p>
<p>DON'T READ THE REVIEWS. DON'T LET GRANDMA GET IT FIRST (ELBOW HER IN HER WRINKLY FUCKING FACE IF YOU HAVE TO). DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE LONG TERM EFFECTS. PRE-ORDER IT FUCKING NOW AND GET THE LIMITED EDITION BOOSTER SHOT DLC FREE OF FUCKING CHARGE. EVERYONE AND THEIR FUCKING GRAN IS GETTING IT, HERE'S A FREE DOUGHNUT, IGNORE THE BLOOD CLOTS AND SEIZURES, IT'S ALL FAKE ANTI-VAX PROPAGANDA, LOOK AT ANTHONY HOPKINS GETTING HIS VACCINE, EVEN HANNIBAL HECKIN' LECTER IS GETTING HIS JABBY JAB! FOMO MOFO! GET IT GET IT GET ITTTTTTT!</p>
<p>Yeah, no. I'll wait. In fact, I'll wait so long you fucking goldfish-brained idiots will move onto some other obsession and forget all about Covid and vaccines and whatever the fuck else the MSM is pumping into your sponge-like brains at this very moment so I can just avoid getting it. If they try to make me I'll just hide in the attic or something and keep an online diary. Enjoy the booster shots and your kids being born (if that's even possible anymore) with T-Rex thalidomide arms. Don't forget to download the NHS app and keep your vaccine passport handy, too. Wouldn't want to be turned away at Tescos because you can't scan the QR code (always reliable by the way).</p></p>

        <p>I remember when vaccines were scarce (Canada) and they were really pushing the Astrazeneca one onto people because it was the only one available and it ended up causing all sorts of health issues. Now people who got the first shot are now having to mix&amp;match vaccines because they can't get the second shot as Astrazeneca since it is in short supply. This example proves it is well worth the wait.</p>

        <p>You've done it again...ranting is clearly an elegant and precise art form to you, because my smile got wider and wider with every word, sentence, and paragraph. By the end I got that fuzzy hype feeling and some kind of positive hormone release in my brain leading to a nice refreshing deep breath. </p>
<p>Once again, never stop embarrassing them, never stop making us laugh, and never stop reassuring us about what we've thought all along but couldn't articulate out loud because of the 'brain fog' caused by the loads of hysteria and propaganda unloaded on us since this circle jerk commenced.</p>
