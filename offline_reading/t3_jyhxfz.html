    <strong>Accommodation for me, but not for thee...</strong>
    <p><p>Over the last twenty years or so, those of us who constitute the "silent majority" have had to endure constant the subsuming of our rights to accommodate whatever vocal minority has the ear of politicians, celebrities, the media, and academia this week. The demands have gotten more and more strident - and more and more outlandish.</p>
<p>Our society has been turned upside down to cater to agendas that would have landed one in a mental hospital 30 years ago.</p>
<p>- You're a dude, and think you are a woman? Let's rewrite years of science, law, and tradition! Nature has it all wrong! Think your son was meant to be a girl? Let's perform life-altering surgery and hormone treatments!</p>
<p>- Allergic to nuts, shellfish, or whatever? Then the other 10,000 people around you can't have it, either! We will decide what your child can brown-bag to school, citizen - it's all in the name of "inclusion"!</p>
<p>- Autism? "ADHD"? Don't worry - feel free to have your meltdown in the classroom. The teacher and other students will leave, so you can destroy the place in peace!</p>
<p>- Don't want to hold down a job? Want to live in a tent city and take over public spaces? By all means. In fact, we will get the taxpayer to fund your lifestyle. Would you like some free needles with that?</p>
<p>What an effin joke. But we appear to have reached our limit. </p>
<p><em>You have health related or psychological reasons that you can't wear a mask? No accommodation for you!</em> </p>
<p>You can stay locked in your house until this is all over, you plague rat! You don't need human interaction - can't you just get everything from Amazon and Uber Eats and stop complaining? It's only a little piece of cloth!</p>
<p>The sad thing is that I have no doubt that those who screamed loudest to "accommodate" the groups I mentioned above, are now the ones screaming loudest to ostracize the non-masked.</p>
<p>When this is all over, I never want to hear anyone bleat about "accommodation" ever again.</p></p>

        <p>You are entitled to your opinion and I agree with some of it, but I personally would leave the trans and mental health stuff out of it. Feel free to downvote me but those things are pretty unrelated to this sub and gives people ammo to call us bigots. And falling into one of those groups doesn’t make someone pro-new normal, I have ADHD and I know a transgender woman who is very against lockdowns and masks.</p>
<p>Btw, this isn’t meant as an attack on you or anything, just my opinion</p>

        <p>You are absolutely entitled to your opinion, and you express it in a civil manner - nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>We may not agree on social or some political issues (there is a wide diversity of viewpoints about these things on this sub), but we definitely need to put that aside and stand together to fight the "New Normal".</p>
<p>Because the "New Normal" is <em>coming for all of us.</em></p>

        <p>Honestly, it seems to me that it's all by design. Gradually ramping up to a confused, divided, depressed, angry and toxic population. </p>
<p>Remember guys, "Everyone's a winner!" (but only the compliant get a prize)</p>
