        <p>Anytime a concerned is raised about side effects of the vaccine, it's 'anti-science'. So these scientists, who have based their previous recommendations on 'the science', and who are now investigating the side effects of the vaccine - are they anti-science? But if they are following 'the science', then isn't questioning these researchers 'anti-science'? So are you scientifically anti-science or anti-scientifically pro-science?</p>

<p>no, they want to be sure these underlying conditions are being marked as the cause of death and not the not-vax</p>
<p>it the same thing they do in reverse with the 'covids deaths', they make sure covid is listed as the c.o.d and not the 2.8 underlying conditions...</p>

        <p>I agree that it's essentially vaccine PR but the very idea that it can be investigated in an official capacity is something the vaccine worshippers couldn't even admit as possible before.</p>

        <p>Twitter history of the Israeli Ministry of Health:</p>
<p>December: Take the vaccine, it's safe.</p>
<p>January: Take the vaccine, it's safe.</p>
<p>February: Take the vaccine, it's safe.</p>
<p>March: Will all the people who took the vaccine and have heart pain please report this asap.  </p>
<p>I'm joking, they'd remove all the previous posts, don't want people to think they were ever saying the vaccine was safe...</p>

        <p>I had my second moderna shot on Tuesday morning. I felt fine after the first one and all day after the second one. Tuesday night I felt extremely sick. Fever, chills, body aches, etc. Didn't feel better until Thursday morning. That morning I felt great. Thursday night laying in bed my chest starts hurting. I start worrying about it and stay up all night looking for what it could be besides a heart attack. Friday it's still bothering me but nothing I can't handle. Around 930am on Saturday it spreads into my left shoulder and down my bicep so I go to the hospital. They do an EKG and bloodwork. The EKG comes back fine so they send me back into the waiting room telling me they think the bloodwork will come back ok too. They are checking for an enzyme that shows the heart's under stress and will check it again 3 hours later to see how it's changed. </p>
<p>About 30 minutes after getting into the waiting room they come get me and bring me to a room. Within seconds I'm swarmed by a dozen Drs and nurses and I'm told I'm having a heart attack. The enzyme levels in my blood are through the roof. They strip me down and prep me for the catheter lab. Once I get to the Cath lab they entered my heart through an artery in my left wrist and the Dr immediately said I wasn't having a heart attack and there were no blockages. They put a pressure bandage on my wrist and put me in an overnight room. This is when they tell me I have Pericarditis. Something that can happen from a virus or infection. I asked if being so sick from the vaccine could have caused it and they said it was possible.</p>
<p>I haven't told anyone that I got the vaccine right before it happened and I was sick on my day off so very few people knew. On one hand I feel like everyone should know this is a possible, although rare, side effect but at the same time I don't want my story to be the reason why someone doesn't get the vaccine. </p>
<p>Now I'm laying in bed with ridiculous chest pain and can't take my medicine again for 11 hours.  I would get the vaccine again but I would be lying if I said I wouldn't be hesitant. This could be the start of lifelong flare ups of heart problems for me.</p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing. Hope you recover quickly and thoroughly. Please consider this account of yours to the journalist Alex Berenson who is collecting examples of people who have experienced adverse effects from the vaccine: http://www.alexberenson.com/contact/</p>

        <p>No, these two conditions are autoimmune. You could put them in the same category as an allergic reaction to the vaccine. It is always a risk for some people.</p>
