        <p>Can you share the source of the scientific journal you are citing?</p>
<p>You don’t know what you are talking about. Just because a chemical has toxic properties doesn’t mean it exhibits those properties when combined with other substances. For example, sodium is highly reactive with water, so much so that it spontaneously combusts when it touches water. Chlorine gas is extremely toxic, even low concentrations can kill you in less than 30 minutes. But combine the two and you get table salt. The scientists who have dedicated their lives to studying this stuff know what is safe and what isn’t.</p>

        <p>The chemicals may be harmless if mixed with enough water or in other ways, but so is the disease itself. There has never been a cure for common cold, tho boiled salt water is said to reduce symptoms. That would explain the sodium which is a component of salt.</p>
<p>But what about the glycol? that's basically an anti freeze chemical and the main component of washer fluid you put in your car to wash away bugs on your windshield.</p>
<p>Why inject this jab in the first place. Harmless or harmful aside it clearly makes no difference in terms of protection.</p>

        <p>You’re absolutely right, ethylene glycol is used in window washing fluid. However polyethylene glycol isn’t the same. Just because there is a glycol doesn’t mean the substances will have similar properties. </p>
<p>There is research coming out that PEG can cause anaphylaxis in very rare cases; 6 out of 272,001 people had a reaction. </p>
<p>The reason why we get vaccines is to make our immune systems aware of a threat. If you were to get covid, your body would have never seen that virus before so the virus could run its course. A vaccine ‘teaches’ the immune system what to look out for and how to defeat a virus. So it does make a difference in terms of protection. </p>
<p>No vaccine is like being sound asleep when thief’s come and rob your entire house. When you wake up you’ll see all your stuff gone, or damaged. So you’ll learn from it and know what to do watch out for, and how to defeat a threat. But the thing is for some people they don’t survive the thief’s. Sometime the thief’s are so bad that they kill the homeowners too.</p>
<p>That’s why we vaccinate. A vaccine is like getting a lesson in home defence from a top instructor. You’ll be taught what to look out for and how to protect your house against intruders.  The intruders may still get in your house, but the damage they’ll do is not as bad because you were prepared for it. </p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

        <p>Oh I am very aware of why we attempt to vaccinate but I’m saying the excipients that are in each vaccine are incredibly toxic to the body. I have researched clinical studies and data to understand this. The risks of covid are less than the risks of this vaccine and that is a FACT.</p>

        <p>There is a vast difference between ingestion of a toxin versus parenteral administration of a toxin. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has never required any consumer products containing organosiloxanes to have these compounds listed as ingredients on any labels (this applies to organic foods as well). This is because for decades physical chemists have brainwashed biochemists into believing that organosiloxanes are chemically and biologically inert, a premise that is now known to be completely untenable. Organosiloxanes and their degradation products also adversely affect enzyme functions (and thereby substrates and metabolites), as well as membrane permeability, neuronal transmission, and mitochondria(power house cells). With regard to mitochondria, oxidative phosphorylation and the electron transfer system are disrupted because silicon behaves like a METAL at times, thereby ALTERING electromagnetic fields. This leads to deficiencies in energy production and energy utilization plus impairment of the mitochondrial-mediated cell danger response to other environmental contaminants (such as pesticides, phthalates, etc.) </p>
<p>Organosiloxane-induced mitochondrial dysfunction can thus be viewed as "the straw that broke the camel's back" - it is analogous to one's house being on fire, but the fire engines cannot get there. Extracellular spillage of damaged mitochondrial organelles readily triggers activation of both innate and adaptive immunity, creating another secondary amplification loop.
Organosiloxanes and their degradation products can biointegrate into life-sustaining matrix macromolecules, which then causes a host of biochemical disruptions. One such macromolecule, a glycosaminoglycan known as chondroitin sulfate, binds the pre-formed mediators of inflammation inside mast cells. When chondroitin sulfate is modified by chemical biointegration inappropriate release of mast cell contents occurs, creating allergic chaos as well as stimulation of other cells to release their inflammatory mediators. One example of the latter involves mast cell mediated activation of brain microglia to secrete their immune stimulating cytokines. This is another example of a secondary amplification loop, which has been referred to as neuroinflammation.</p>
