    <strong>International flight... masks... which one??</strong>
    <p><p>We’ve got an international fight coming up and as per flight regulations masks are a must. As much as I hate them I don’t want to course an issue inflight (as I really want to get back home.) which mask is the most breathable? 
Lace would of course be the fabric of choice but I highly doubt it would be allowed. I’ve heard the ones with the valves are the better option? I also don’t want to be touching my face all the time. I just want to peacefully get back home with no drawn attention or issues.</p></p>

        <p>The only time I have worn a mask is when on an airplane and in Vegas.  When on the plan, don't "F" around.  Wear the diaper.  I did push things a bit but not too much.  All my flights I pulled it down to sleep and was never bothered.  I also pulled it down to "eat".  Basically, you will know how far you can push things.  If told to put it back on, be polite and comply.  This sucks but the only time I will tell someone to comply is because you literally do NOT have a choice.</p>
<p>Keep in mind flight attendants don't have a choice but to enforce.  Even though most hate it as much as you do.</p>
<p>I have worn my Trump 2020 mask, one that says "NOT BRAINWASHED, FORCED TO COMPLY", one that says "THIS MASK IS AS USELESS AS YOURS" and one that says "PLACEBO".</p>

        <p>Yes, that’s exactly why I’m asking which one. We flying to Canada, two flights, Amsterdam and then Ontario. So it’s going to be a pain. Oh my word. I love that. Forced to comply.</p>

        <p>Sorry, I read that as you wanted to have some statement on it....</p>
<p>My suggestion would be get a few of the cheap blue paper ones.  Most airlines will have them and hand them out.  The cheap ones tend to break and fall apart.... .go figure.</p>

        <p>I would take 2 masks: 2 surgical masks</p>
<p>the first one you wear until you are seated. then you switch to the second mask, quickly.
the second mask was prepared: keep in mind that these masks have 3 layers, so if you are careful and use scissors, 2 layers can be removed. breathability will strongly increase. it will make the mask more transparent so try to keep it low-key</p>

        <p>I have PTSD and really struggle with masks. On my first flight during all this I wore a surgical mask and just pushed the nose piece out so it was not tight on my nose at all. I have a blanket I fly with to stay warm and I kind of cuddled up with that and rested my chin on the bundled up blanket and rested it so it pushed the bottom of the mask out as well while I slept. That way it looked like the mask was covering my nose and mouth but it wasn’t touching my skin at all and was kind of pushed out in front. I normally wear a mesh mask but was told it wasn’t sufficient and had to switch to the surgical one when I got on the plane, but on my last flight I switched back to the mesh one during the flight-the flight attendants weren’t paying that close of attention, they just look to see if something is there or not, so if you can get one that doesn’t look too sheer that’s great. Printed chiffon works well.</p>

        <p>So I will start with that I medically cannot wear a mask, but also only do so when I absolutely need to. One thing that I did was sip water the entire flight, so no one told me to wear a mask while doing that. Then I also made sure that I had a window seat so when I took a nap, I was able to turn to the window, pull the hood of my hoodie up, and not wear the mask while sleeping. I only pulled up my mask when walking to the bathroom, but the second I closed the door, that mask was pulled all the way down. I also would keep it down and pull it up when I saw a flight attendant come around. Once, a flight attendant caught me and told me to pull it up, so I did. So just be aware and make sure to take as many surreptitious mask breaks as possible.</p>

        <p>This is really the key - gets you out of a mask for most of the flight while avoiding any insanity that could get you kicked off if someone has issues. </p>
<p>Flights are expensive and usually we’re going somewhere to do something specific ... not the best time to take a stand against masks.</p>

        <p>Exactly. I don’t wear one while in the airport or while sitting at the gate. Oddly enough, no one has ever said anything to me (but this was in the summer when much of the hysteria wasn’t as hysterical as it is now). But the second I get up to line up to board the plane I wear it, and then find ways to not wear it without getting myself kicked off. It’s the only way.</p>

        <p>Just use the ones that are made of cotton fabric. They are thin and really lightweight so they will be more comfortable to wear compared to other cloth masks. I got mine from Puraka Masks and used them when I flew last time. Don't worry. You can always pull down your masks once in a while so you wouldn't be that bothered during the flight.</p>

        <p>I recommend this one from Etsy <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/864171897/indigo-blue-thinnest-breathable?ref=hp_opfy-2&amp;bes=1">https://www.etsy.com/listing/864171897/indigo-blue-thinnest-breathable?ref=hp_opfy-2&amp;bes=1</a>. It is incredibly thin and breathable, basically a mesh mask that doesn't "look" like a mesh mask.</p>

        <p>Try asking them. The advantage of speaking to a person versus a machine is that they can be reasoned with.</p>
<p>Tell them face shields cover the eyes as well the mouth, while masks only cover the mouth, which are open only some of the time.</p>

        <p>I wouldn’t go this route - even if the CEO himself tells him that a face shield is sufficient ahead of time, that has no bearing on whether a flight attendant will have a temper tantrum and kick him off.</p>

        <p>Ugh. I agree with you.</p>
<p>It makes me sick. There was an ad for Amazon warehouse, and they were all wearing masks.</p>
<p>Do you know how hard it is to work in warehouses without using a mask? Amazon is also notorious for treating its employees poor at all levels.</p>
<p>I've worked in a warehouse, that's where I got the idea for a face shield if I go work there again. In summer it gets crazy. Might as just shoot you on the spot.</p>

        <p>Just the standard blue ones from Amazon are fine and remember you can remove then to drink and eat</p>
<p>Just use hand sanitizer when you taking it off etc..wouldn't worry about it too much.</p>
