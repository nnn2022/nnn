    <strong>Covinfo Data Dump (July 30th 2021) - Large collection of useful information which both newcomers and seasoned NNNers should find valuable.</strong>
    <p><p><strong>Covinfo Data Dump:-</strong></p>
<p>The following is a collection of useful/interesting data on the the Covid19 vaccines and potential alternative treatments:</p>
<p><strong>Academic Articles:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Research results of past vaccines for sars-cov1 that used the spike protein:-</strong></p>
<p>Journal article from 2004 on autoimmune disorders from Sars-cov1 vaccine that also focused on the spike protein:
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2004/12/sars-vaccine-linked-liver-damage-ferret-study</p>
<p>Journal article from 2005 on autoimmune disorders from Sars-cov1 vaccine that also focused on the spike protein:
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15755610/</p>
<p>Journal article from 2012 on autoimmune disorders from Sars-cov1 vaccine that also focused on the spike protein:
https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035421</p>
<p>Journal article from 2020 on autoimmune disorders from Sars-cov vaccine (can't figure out if they're talking about cov1 or 2):
https://jvi.asm.org/content/78/22/12672.abstract</p>
<p>Journal article from 2020 explains why immune disorders happen with covid vax, because human and Covid19 proteins are similar:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589909020300186</p>
<p><strong>Antibody Dependent Enhancement:-</strong></p>
<p>Journal article from 2005 shows evidence that sars-cov1 vaccine, that also focused on the spike protein, caused ADE when subjects were challenged with different strain:
https://www.nature.com/articles/news050110-3#ref-CR1</p>
<p>Article explaining how ADE works in Sar-cov1:
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2538-8</p>
<p>Article explaining the potential for ADE in Covid19:
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2538-8</p>
<p>Another article that speculates on the potential for ADE in Covid19:
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32920233/</p>
<p>Article from 2021 explains that there is evidence that covid19 is able to kill macrophages by using antibody dependent mechanisms:
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.22.432407v1 </p>
<p><strong>Studies about the spike protein:-</strong></p>
<p>How the virus uses the spike protein to enter human cells:
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02039-y </p>
<p>Article on how the Covid19 spike protein crosses the blood-brain barrier:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096999612030406X?via%3Dihub</p>
<p>Japanese article on how the Pfizer vax is associated with brain hemorrhaging (lending credence to the hypothesis that the spike proteins are crossing the blood brain barrier in some people):
https://joppp.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40545-021-00326-7</p>
<p>Article on how AstraZeneca is associated with blood clots in the brain (lending more credence to the hypothesis that the spike proteins are crossing the blood brain barrier in some people):
https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2104840</p>
<p>Article with evidence that spike proteins do end up circulating in the blood, when they're not supposed to, they're supposed to be anchored on the cell membranes:
https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciab465/6279075</p>
<p>More evidence that spike proteins do not stay on the cell membranes but end up circulating in the blood. This study aims to explain the blood clots caused by the J&amp;J and AstraZeneca adenovector vaccines, they claim that the DNA isn't properly spliced and the spike protiens end up in the blood causing thrombosis when the spikes attach to the ACE2 receptors of the endothelial cells:
https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-558954/v1</p>
<p>Article on how the spike protein can cause neurodegeneration:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X2100499X?via%3Dihub</p>
<p>Journal article with evidence that the spike protein by itself can damage cells by binding to ACE2, causing the cells mitochondria to lose their shape and break apart:
https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.318902</p>
<p>Article on how the spike protein in vaccines can cause cell damage:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7827936/</p>
<p><strong>Biodistribution data:-</strong></p>
<p>Pfizer animal testing document that was obtained by Dr. Byram Bridle through a FOI request to the Japanese government which shows the biodistribution of the lipid-nano particles throughout the bodies and organs of the test subjects. This is evidence that the lipid nanoparticles do not stay in the injecton site, but instead travel all throughout the body (go to pg 16/23 for the charts showing biodistribution over the course of 48hrs):
https://files.catbox.moe/0vwcmj.pdf</p>
<p>Addendum to the above link. This blog post provides easy to understand information (with pictures) on the make-up of the lipid nanoparticles used in the Covid19 vaccines. It shows that the pharmaceutical companies could have designed them to have targeting ligands on the outside, so that the nanoparticles would only transfect the muscle cells. But instead the vax was designed with PEG polymers on the outside, so that the immune system will not be able to pick them up and put them in the trash. The PEG is what Byram Bridle says is the reason the vaccine travels throughout the body and since it does not have targeting ligands, it can transfect any type of cell:
https://www.cas.org/resource/blog/understanding-nanotechnology-covid-19-vaccines</p>
<p><strong>Vaccine Enhanced Immune Escape:-</strong></p>
<p>Evidence of cov2 immune escape:
https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/06/30/science.abi7994</p>
<p>Article from 2015 that explains how imperfect vaccination (like the Pfizer and moderna that require at least two shots to be effective) can create immune escape variants:
https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002198</p>
<p>Article from 2021 explains that unless vaccination is done quickly, there will be a high probability of escape mutants:
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-95025-3</p>
<p><strong>Studies on covid recovered:-</strong></p>
<p>No benefit from vaccination of previously infected individuals:
https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.01.21258176v2</p>
<p>Covid19 infection produces long lasting immunity:
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03647-4</p>
<p>Second article that covid19 infection produces life long immunity:
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01442-9 </p>
<p>More evidence that covid19 infection produces long term immunity:
https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.19.21255739v1</p>
<p><strong>Vaccine efficacy:-</strong></p>
<p>Article explains how vaccine manufacturers have used relative risk reduction to determine that vaccine efficacy is ~90+%, however they should have used absolute risk reduction which would tell us that the vaccines will only reduce total covid cases by ~1%:
https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(21)00069-0/fulltext</p>
<p>Article from 2005 explains that antibodies to the S-protein and the M-protein are effective in neutralizing the sars-cov1 virus. However, the sars-cov2 vaccines only target the S-protein. This evidence that the vaccine manufacturers could have chosen to make a superior mrna vax that produced two types of antibodies, but chose to focus narrowly on just the S-protein:
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16544518/</p>
<p>Antibodies from vaccines start to drop within 6 months, get ready for endless boosters:
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03777-9</p>
<p><strong>Ivermectin:-</strong></p>
<p>Meta-analysis on the efficacy of Ivermectin in treating Covid19:
https://journals.lww.com/americantherapeutics/Abstract/9000/Ivermectin_for_Prevention_and_Treatment_of.98040.aspx</p>
<p>Ivermectin stops replication of covid:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354220302011 </p>
<p>Ivermectin has anti-viral properties:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3888155/ </p>
<p>Ivermectin has anti-viral properties against covid:
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41429-020-0336-z</p>
<p>Evidence that Ivermectin can be effective as a prophylaxis, Mexican frontline healthcare workers were given Ivermectin as a preventative and zero got sick with covid, whereas 58.2% of the control group who did not take Ivermectin got covid:
https://www.buongiornosuedtirol.it/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Nota-Journal-of-Biomedical-Research-Safety-and-Efficacy-Iota-Carrageenan-and-Ivermectin.pdf</p>
<p>Ivermectin safe to give 12mg per day for 5 days:
https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712%2820%2932506-6/fulltext</p>
<p>Ivermectin safely administered 60mg per day for 6 months:
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10428194.2020.1786559</p>
<p><strong>Fluvoxamine:-</strong></p>
<p>Fluvoxamine helps in covid treatment:
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33180097/ </p>
<p>Covid leads to long term inflammation, useful for long haul Covid19 treatment:
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33391730/ </p>
<p>Fluvoxamine has anti-inflammatory properties that can help treat covid:
https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2021.652688/full</p>
<p>Fluvoxamine targets sigma-1 to stop covid replication:
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33403480/</p>
<p><strong>VAERS:-</strong></p>
<p>Analysis on the VAERS death data shows that in 86% of reports the vaccine cannot be ruled out as a causal factor in the death of the patient:
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352837543_Analysis_of_COVID-19_vaccine_death_reports_from_the_Vaccine_Adverse_Events_Reporting_System_VAERS_Database_Interim_Results_and_Analysis</p>
<p>Addendum to the above link. OpenVAERS is a site that allows you to easily read VAERS reports and breaks down the numbers. The reports seem to be a lot of people who have comorbidities or are old, but there are also some really eye opening cases where young people experience horrible side effects. Read for yourself and make up your own mind about what the vax is doing to your fellow Americans:

<p>Know the law, the compromised U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has ruled that employers CAN require vaccination as a condition of employment (this ruling will have to be challenged in a court of law, so do not approach your employer with the false attitude of having the higher legal ground, they will likely dismiss you since the EEOC is backing tyranny):

<p><strong>PCR test:-</strong></p>
<p>It seems that the PCR test that we've all been using cannot discriminate between a covid infection and a flu infection. It has therefore had its EUA revoked by the CDC:

        <p>Beautiful, thank you. I saved the page as a pdf for now, but you got a faster way to save this? E.g. a single doc I can download?</p>
<p>Maybe copy paste will work. I didn't go through it, but looks like none of the links are embedded.</p>
<p>Are all the links archived?</p>
