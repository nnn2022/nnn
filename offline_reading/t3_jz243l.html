    <strong>Covid Conquered Christianty - checkout the propaganda if you search for 'covid mark of the beast' on youtube</strong>
    <p><p>Try a search for 'covid' and 'mark of the beast'</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mark+of+the+beast+covid</p>
<p>Back in april, the gov gave out payroll 'loans' to businesses. They turned into grants if you met certain easy conditions. Turns out A LOT of churches applied. huh? Stimulus for a closed down building?</p>
<p>Part of this deal was to become part of the propaganda machine for Covid. If you search for https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mark+of+the+beast+covid you will get sermons that emphatically state that the vaccine is not at all the mark of the beast.</p>
<p>Ive watched many and the arguments are all similar... so its a script they were given</p>
<ul>
<li>dont fear technology you ludite. your phone is far more dangerous. look i have a pacemaker..do i have the mark ??</li>
<li>jesus wants us to love our neighbors .. so be a good slave and take the shot</li>
<li>mark of the beast was back in neros time..you dummy</li>
<li>here is a book by this expert that tells us its not (they never reference the bible directly..which is so explicitly clear)</li>
<li>the vaccine wont have a chip..look at these experts</li>
</ul>
<p>What they will never tell you is the facts</p>
<ul>
<li>covid vaccines will come with bill gates digital certificates (a numerical code assigned to you)</li>
<li>this is done by using an 'ink' called Luciferase that marks you and lights up under infared</li>
<li>the tech is already developed but not yet revealed to the masses</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read about it here. There is a video demonstrating the mark of the beast</p>
<p>https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/spiky-patch-could-invisibly-record-vaccination-history-under-skin-180973809/</p>
<p>Of course this is how mainstream christianity has to end. I mean if everyone is going to be fooled into taking the mark of the beast from Satan, then obviously you are going to have vaccination centers at churches.</p>
<p>Keep something else in mind</p>
<p>Trump + Pence = Trumpets (a warning from God)</p>
<p>Biden = Biddin (doing Satan's / NWO mandates)</p>
<p>If Biden expires and Kamalah takes over, then we will have Jezabel - the woman of revelation.</p></p>
