    <strong>I think I need a break from social media</strong>
    <p><p>I can speak only for my area, I know (Newark, NJ), but for me, there is a drastic difference between online and outside. Last night, I made the mistake of getting into what turned out to be a <em>five-hour long</em> yelling match about masks on notalwaysright.com (yeah, last place I'd expect). I've been off work since Sept 14th, so that's why I had the time (I return on Oct 1st).</p>
<p>The result was a bad headache. As of late, my suicidal feelings cropped up again too. I've been struggling with the feelings for a few months now since April (before then, I hadn't had a problem since late teens), but they come in waves. Sometimes, I feel completely okay. Other times, I want to hurl myself out of my apartment window. I flip-flop with the date of my birthday (late April) being the my last day on Earth.</p>
<p>I use social media because it's how I keep up with my friends (who also seem to be over it; they don't post about masks, social distancing, or lockdowns anymore), but I think I need a break because I'm getting more stress from that than from outside. I feel like the world is on fire, but no one I've interacted with or passed by outside seems out of their mind. Whereas the internet makes it seem like everyone is frothing at the mouth, ready to kill "anti-maskers" on the spot.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, from that conversation last night, I realized it's less about the mask and more about how someone thinks; I said so many times I do wear a mask, which is true, but because I refuse to agree with them, I was just a troll with a fake life. The point I was making beforehand is someone's entire person shouldn't be assumed based in whether or not they're wear a certain fabric. Or in short, my entire point was <strong>don't judge</strong>. Never did I think suggesting to not assume would ignite wrath. So, you could wear a mask 24/7 and follow every rule to a T, but if you don't think like them, you're still an anti-masker/murderer.</p>
<p>As for what sparked the conversation, Not Always Right published a collection of "anti-mask" stories. There goes one of my favorite sites.</p></p>

        <p>Sorry you're going through that, OP. Yeah, a break from social media sounds exactly like what you need right now.</p>
<p>&rt;So, you could wear a mask 24/7 and follow every rule to a T, but if you  don't think like them, you're still an anti-masker/murderer. </p>
<p>And you are 100% right about that. Once you realize that the maskholes, Branch Covidians or what have you, are a genuine, literal cult, damn near everything about them makes sense.</p>

        <p>I'm probably late to realize it. I like to not think the worst of people, but I guess that was the first time I saw it was that bad. It is indeed similar to a cult, which is kind of creepy.</p>
<p>Those people are real, of course, but at the same time, it's kind of surreal to me that seems to exist mostly (or solely) online. I expected to run into one of these crazies by now. Like, how did these people live pre-2020? What were their lives?</p>
<p>(One claimed to be a paramedic. Since he was pro-mask, he wasn't assumed to be lying.)</p>
