        <p>Totally. Seperating from ego to appreciate humanity as humanity, rather than worrying about opinions and your image makes tribalism trivial at best and the social propoganda doesn't work any longer.</p>

        <p>I have tried mushrooms for the first time last week. Took a gram all alone medidating, reading, drinking tea and listening to music. It strucked me how I absolutly don't need society that much. I was so very happy to be just alone, contemplating things. I know I will eventually ends up with no job with my back against the wall... but somehow the psylocibin spirit made me feel it is the way it should be. I will be alone but I will use my creativity. Pretty exciting moment.</p>

        <p>Hey, am I missing something here?</p>
<p>You don't think psychedelics should be legal, but isn't a government that criminalizes the consumption of a certain substance the definition of control and tyranny? Not having bodily autonomy isn't consistent with freedom and liberty.  </p>
<p>This is no different than the people who support vaccine mandates. What I choose to consume or do with my body isn't up to the government or anyone else for that matter. </p>

        <p>I’ve never tried an illegal drug.  I’ve never misused a drug to get high.<br>
But… I lean more libertarian when it comes to drugs. As long as there are strict enforcement of laws (and follow through punishment) concerning damaging people’s body, property, etc.<br>
if someone wants to drop LSD, I don’t care.  If they drive, they are idiots, but ok, whatever. If they drive and crash into someone, damaging their car or hurting/killing them…. Well, they should be charged the most severe way possible. </p>
<p>But the real reason psychedelics are illegal isn’t because it makes you think, it’s because people are idiots who don’t want to pay for bad decisions.  Other people are idiots who’d rather punish people for things that never happened, because there was a chance it might happen. </p>
<p>I’ve known people who went down the shroom “spiritual journey” and they may think they are deep, but they are just high.  One dumb ass was growing shelf after shelf of shrooms in his bathroom with his 4 year old kid in the house with free access to them.</p>

        <p>Thanks for your insight! </p>
<p>Just to be very clear, you've never tried an illegal drug, so you're obviously not very just familiar with plant medicine and psychedelic substances. Sorry for my bluntness, but your assumptions are absolutely incorrect. No, psychedelics are not illegal "because people are idiots who don't want to pay for their bad decisions". Where did you get that information from? The government? The mainstream media?</p>
<p>As someone who has overseen psychedelic therapy sessions, I am very aware of the incredible benefits psychedelics can offer if treated with absolute respect. Psychedelics dissolve the boundaries between self and other (ego-death) and can help people realize their true nature, outside of their identification with the ego structure. If not treated with respect, psychedelics can certainly result in traumatic and terrifying experiences. However, research shows there is no link between mental health issues and psychedelic use.</p>

        <p>People are, in fact, idiots.  Think about a person with average intelligence, now realize, half the people are dumber than him.  </p>
<p>I’m glad you clarified. Now let me.  While psychadelics and drugs in general have helped give society much in the way of literature, philosophy, religion, and music, not everyone is a Coleridge, Sartre, Moses, or Morrison.  </p>
<p>Most people are just not that bright. </p>
<p>As for “where do I get the information from,” drunk driving statistics and laws.   Drinking is legal, and people drink and drive.  They know the chances, should know their limits, and get behind the wheel anyway.  </p>
<p>Drinking doesn’t cause hallucinations.  Psychedelics do. You may not take a dose and drive, but would other people, yes… most assuredly. </p>
<p>It doesn’t take a study or source to prove people are idiots that make bad decisions, don’t want to pay for them, and there are people that want to control others and do so by making things illegal before any damage to property or person happens. Those people are idiots too.</p>

        <p>After reading this thread, I still highly disagree with your thoughts behind why psychedelics are illegal. </p>
<p>Alcohol severely effects decision making in a negative way. Therefore, making it especially easier to make bad decisions that may harm others. </p>
<p>The last thing I want to do when tripping is hurt anyone. I just want to relax and embrace the love and eye opening experience it brings… Especially if you’ve never experienced something like psilocybin, you just simply wouldn’t be able to fully understand what it is that it does. Language itself cannot even fully describe what an experience feels like and what it shows you. </p>
<p>Sounds crazy, I know. I used to be super against all drugs for myself. Didn’t mind for other people doing it but I wanted to be “pure”. Whatever that meant to my younger mind. Not that I’m complaining though. I’m glad I was abstinent from doing anything too mentally altering until about 19. Of course it may be best to wait until after the brain is fully developed, though I don’t regret anything I’ve done thus far.</p>
<p>Not trying to come off as snarky either just so you’re aware. I think it’s always important to remember not to become so emotionally attached to a singular idea about something. You may find you’re right, you may find you’re wrong. But it would be significantly hard to realize you’re wrong if you’re emotionally attached to the said idea. </p>
<p>Open to criticism if anyone has some for me.</p>

        <p>The last thing you want to do is…. </p>
<p>But… I like to drink occasionally, rarely, but will not drive even after just one.  </p>
<p>There are still people who drink and drive.  You could be the most responsible person, but… are people responsible as a whole?</p>
<p>Short answer: no. </p>
<p>Your argument that “you’ve never done it, so you can’t understand” is a pretty lame argument.  I won’t get into why, you know why it is.  It’s embarrassing (for you) that you used it.</p>

        <p>I can see how not everyone would make the same decisions I would under the same substances. </p>
<p>I say what I said before because I think back to what I used to say or think about psychedelics. All of my prejudgements were shattered once I tried it. With the experience being so profound, it gives me the impression that it’s just not something anyone can fully grasp without having experienced it themselves. As OP mentioned, psilocybin dissolves the boundaries between self and other (ego death). Explaining what that feels like successfully to someone who hasn’t felt that before imo is near impossible. </p>
<p>Maybe I am incorrect though, which is why I said I’m open to criticism.</p>

<p>Is that a natural state of some people,  or is it brought upon by their environment in some way?</p>
