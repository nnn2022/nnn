    <strong>The media created a monster “virus.”</strong>
    <p><p>The steady barrage of hateful comments and mandates from the vaccinated amongst us have reached epidemic proportions— pun intended. The sheer amount of evil that is uttered our way on a daily basis is both jarring and absurd. The media continues to paint us an the villain because we’re leery of vaccine. </p>
<p>The woke machine continues to be fed by folks who’re getting high off of fear and hysteria, willfully choosing to be mindless rocks with ears, thus turning a blind eye to rationality. They’re blinded by rage and uncertainty that has turned them against their neighbor. Compassion has been substituted for hate and a lack of understanding. </p>
<p>If someone wants to get the vaccine, that’s their choice and I respect it. Oddly enough, I’ve indicated that I’m not sure about it, and the wolves come to attack me, leaving no bones behind. “You murderer! Stop the spread! It’s your fault we haven’t reached herd immunity!” People out there are monsters. What happened to critical thinking? What happened to my body, my choice? I thought discrimination was a terrible stain on the fabric of humanity, but I guess when it comes to masks and vaccines, it’s acceptable. </p>
<p>Constant fear mongering and extremism disguised as a deep care for society is what’s really jacked up about America. Lord help us all. I never thought World War 3 would be between the Vaccinated and the unvaccinated. As our civil liberties continue to be violated, we’re speeding toward a dark place in American history.</p></p>

        <p>I am convinced every time you get a pcr swab shoved up your nose, you are being drugged with a tiny amount of a drug that makes you more willing to do whatever, and believe whatever an authority voice tells you. Every test makes one more compliant with authority, and more susceptible to propaganda. So you find the ones that have taken few or no tests are looking at the masses just going wtf??!!</p>

        <p>As of two days ago, the "get the jab to protect others" argument is invalid. It's now known that vaccination doesn't stop transmission. It does reduce hospitalization and death for those who get the jab, but they can no longer say you're selfish for not getting it. It's like a motorcycle helmet, it only protects the wearer (jabbed).</p>
