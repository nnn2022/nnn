    <strong>Yesterday I got some hope</strong>
    <p><p>So there was a race in my town yesterday organized by a local car and though it may not seem important to you especially to some who are from the US who have fewer restrictions it was big for us. There was 110 cars which competed and the whole town was there. Next to the town hall there were old timers parked for everyone to see, local motorbike clubs came to showoff their bikes. Racers were drifting down the road and doing burnouts in the intersection. Almost nobody was wearing masks, everyone was talking to each other and having fun. Might seem like a small thing but I think that was the first event of such size that was held at my town since 2019. I was reading and seeing many positive posts from people on this sub over the last few weeks and I finally have my own to share. Don't loose hope guys.</p></p>

        <p>What region? You give me hope the Bay Area will get there, I don't think some people from a lot of the US even quite grasp how dystopian this place is. I'd be ecstatic if we had something that big with no masks and people having fun</p>

        <p>Zasavje region in Slovenia. The government enforcing the lockdowns is right wing while our post industrial town still has a lot of that communist mentality as the town went to shit when all industry went bankrupt following the independence and collapse of communism. Many people who are old enough to remember these days are seeing them as glory days when the town had a bright future. That's why our town is very against our current government (which wasn't elected btw) and has protested it since the start. Though this event was actually legal as restrictions are starting to loosen and people are being sick of lockdowns. But yeah people don't give a fuck about covid here, also fun fact: a guy working on the start for a whole day is 80 years old, talking about how old and is still the main ski lift operator/maintenance guy at a local ski resort. Talking about how we need to protect old people from covid.</p>

        <p>The old people are usually the ones that don't care, it's frustrating how younger people have decided how old people will act now. People here haven't seen communism so they cheer it on with no idea what they're asking for, they have no idea.</p>

        <p>Yep the guy in charge was a communist for years, but then when the old country collapsed he just switched sides and became a far right nationalist. Old people mostly see him as hero while young people hate him, the only exception is my region where everyone hates him because as I said the best days of our town were in communist towns when industry was still up and well. People need to realize extremism is very bad.</p>
