    <strong>Who else won't be getting that toilet paper money they call a stimulus check?</strong>
    <p><p>Yeah, so I did my taxes. I've had the same address and bank account since way before we got the last round of stimuli. I'm 27, single and financially fucked. I definitely qualify. And you could say I've been financially affected by covid, albeit in a small way. First off our restaurant shut down way back, but I also recently had fucking covid. I didn't test for it but it was going around, and I had direct contact with other people that were tested positive (although I know they're unreliable tests), and I had all the symptoms. So regardless, I had to miss 10 days recently. Even though it's not shit and was basically just a cold where you can't taste or smell. So missed that pay.</p>
<p>Now I learn my 'Payments not available'. And also learned that people who get this message when trying to track their late payment, won't be getting the second check until after filing 2020 tax returns. LMFAO. Firstly, I don't care. It's 600 dollars. But Jesus Christ the amount of insult these sick fucks sling at people. What about the people that really, really needed it that get this bullshit message. Its obscenely pathetic that people in need were even insulted with this amount of money in the first place. Like on top of this measly, fucking disgusting little crumpled amount of ass wipe worthy money, for a scam that's ravaged countless livelihoods, you simply 'won't get it' until you jump through more hoops. You won't get it until you give them more of your money. LMFGDFAO (laughing my fucking goddamn fucking ass off). Seriously though this is a new level of perversion for them. You think Bill Gates gets the 'Payment not available' message? No, but what he does get is Billions more, so he can vaccinate people for a 'terrible illness' that was less severe than any cold or flu I've ever had. You literally can't even use the word severe when describing it. I know people are different and old people can be in danger but what they've done is unforgivable. Truly. I won't ever trust this country again. I didn't to begin with but now I won't even entertain the possibility.</p>
<p>I think this is grounds enough to march directly to their fucking homes in masses. Its simply fucking disgusting and evil how they treat their citizens. Living large and wiping their asses with our scraps, and then snatching them back and dangling them over our heads. I refuse to participate. I'll make my own way in this fucking joke world B movie dystopia. But I had to say this and rant and vent and empathize with anyone else that's feeling the same way. I don't need the money technically and I don't want it either. I mean anything would help me right now I am ungodly poor, but the principle is the point and how this world works is truly a fucking mess and needs to be cleaned up.</p>
<p>Edit: I shouldn't say I'm ungodly poor by any means. That's not accurate. I'm always financially struggling and the income is week to week and my bills are barely covered, but I have an ungodly amount of things I'm grateful for. From the roof over my head to my comic books to my clothes to the instruments and music computer I have. I'm truly lucky to live the life I live. I just meant poor as far as making money and paying bills goes. But I'm a lot better off than a lot of people so its not fair to say. </p></p>

        <p>I didn't get the first check, and I won't get a second. On one hand, I'm blessed that I had a high enough income the last couple years to make me ineligible. On the other, my income is currently less than half of what it used to be. So, it sucks, but whatever I guess.</p>

        <p>Yeah I get you’re angry. But if you got it last time you’re very likely to get it this time.</p>
<p>Last time it said something similar for lots of people but it just hadn’t been processed.</p>
<p>This amount of money is a pittance that won’t really help families and will bury our country in debt, so I don’t totally understand your rant, but you’re extremely likely to get the $600.</p>

        <p>Well thanks for the heads up. And i feel ya but anything helps people that are already financially fucked. This won’t truly help of course not its 600, but sometimes anything counts. But yeah its doubly insulting. They won’t even give us enough but when we accept that and just take what we can get then they won’t even give it out lol.</p>
<p>But yeah its ass backwards to shut down a country and ruin the economy and livelihoods and then bury yourself in debt trying to give billionaires billions more and give ‘money’ back to the people for a virus that makes you lose your sense of smell.</p>

        <p>Go through a proper tax filing service. Not something like H&amp;R Block or whatever Walmart does. I did that and the tax lady found that she was able to get me to get the checks for my 2020 return this year. Yeah I’ll have to wait, but least I’ll get it. </p>
<p>Though I get your sentiment regardless that this whole situation is a massive joke.</p>

        <p>Yeah I did it with freetaxusa which wasn’t mentioned as far as fucking up the process. I probably don’t know what I’m talking about specifically, and wrote this in a hot fury, but thanks for noticing my overarching point. Which is fuck this entire last year and our governments fondling of it. With their greedy little tiny claws. Fucking inhuman bastards.</p>

        <p>Thats what I read if you’re receiving the payment not available message. Or whatever the fuck it said. I tried to track mine and got that or something similar. And I paid my taxes so it makes no sense to me. I donno maybe I got this all wrong and should double check exactly what it said to me but I’m pretty sure thats what it said and when I googled it theres articles saying that message means I have to wait till my tax return for whatever fucking reason. I also filed with freetaxusa which doesn’t seem to matter cause I also read filing with turbo or h&amp;r messes with the process. I donno point is this is all horseshit.</p>

        <p>Well I’m not gonna lie it’d be really helpful but fuck it its an insult in the first place because its not much compared to what they can give and what certain people and families really deserve. And the fact they act like they truly care about American lives with this vaccine, but can do this and try to give us 600 fucking dollars is just rich. Instead they gave our money away to billionaires and other countries and to themselves.</p>
