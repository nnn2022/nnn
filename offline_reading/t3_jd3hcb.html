    <strong>Virus tyranny is expected in the age of performative privilege obsession</strong>
    <p><p>You leave your house and try to remember if you left the stove on. You've never done that before, and you know you probably didn't, but you wonder, irrationally: what if everyone's things will burn down, and everyone hates me for being so careless?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now I witness an extremely performative paranoia of young people fearing, in the statistically 0% chance, that they caused a spread that could indirectly kill someone. How irresponsible, how selfish, how evil people would think you are. I saw my friend who learns her friend's sister tests positive, and she guiltily reports it to her entire little network, with fear ensuing, and prying investigations into the nature of her connections. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Do we fear anyone actually getting hurt? Of course not, it is the social stigma of spreading it. Similar to the trendy stigma of (usually white) privilege. "I am getting tested before going to another state, seeing my parents, etc." They brag, as ironically they only have the time and privilege of being able to go get tested, as is fashionable among the youth. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>They also brag about how ashamed they are of their privilege. Do they learn valuable skills to better their fellow man, or voluntarily share their wealth? No, they vote, they post. They insist, "well at least I am not a part of the problem--I am aware of my privilege and denounce it," whatever that may mean. These people are obsessed with not causing an externality that could harm someone--while they ironically massively consume items, many that can all be indirectly linked to horrors in other countries.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>That is why people are now neurotically obsessed with every interaction and will nosily pry every interaction you have, even turning each other in when they do not approve of your interactions. This is  privileged and white people's ultimate obsession with their own guilt of how they could affect others. It is empty, and deadly.</p></p>

        <p>And of course, only covid deaths count. Someone you don't know might get covid from you spreading it to them? Oh no, better stay inside forever! Someone you do know might commit suicide because you cut off all contact with them while denouncing them for how "reckless" and evil they are for trying to visit people? Not your concern, they were mentally ill or whatever and anyway they deserved to die.</p>

        <p>Yeah they are so petty and small minded that only something as comprehendable as giving someone a disease is of worry. But supporting a system that leads to millions of suffering and even dying, that connection isn't direct enough. Or at least I hope it's just stupidity and they don't realize it.. eh they definitely realize it. They just only care about how someone would view them for spreading disease, bc that blame would be explicit. Dead from lockdown collateral damage? Ehhhh wasn't MY fault technically. No responsibility</p>
