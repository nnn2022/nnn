        <p>There's someone out there saying "We weren't aware of all the info back then" 
Erm no. I remember him saying masks were not effective at all, but now, they are. 
What info do we have now about masks that we didn't have a year ago? Masks aren't new so what is the new info lol</p>

        <p>Funny, his advice change conveniently appears after the failure of “15 days to slow the spread.” </p>
<p>2/29/2020 Surgeon General tweets that masks are “NOT effective”</p>
<p>3/8 Famous 60 minutes interview where Fauci chuckles at mask wearers. Tension is ramping, but panic hadn’t really set in quite yet. </p>
<p>3/16 Panic approaches all time high. Tom Hanks recently diagnosed, events being cancelled everywhere. This first flip-flop results in a hardcore nationwide lockdown. “15 days to slow the spread” starts today. </p>
<p>3/31 “15 days” over. It’s a failure. You can’t stop a respiratory virus by watching Netflix for 2 weeks. Experts were dead wrong. White House/task force flip flop again to a longer term strategy. Experts can’t admit they are just making things up as they go, so this strategy shift retroactively gets attributed to a mask shortage. </p>
<p>4/3 After flip flop #2, CDC now recommends face masks. “15 days” has failed and we need a longer term strategy. </p>
<p>4/8 first of many statewide mask mandates. People are too scared to notice the inconsistencies.</p>

        <p>i was listening to talk AM radio here in socal, USA, and the doctor on there was asked why are we wearing masks when vaccinated? he gave an honest, but dumb answer. he said its a societal politness. we dont know who is vaxxed so we wear it for courtesy. </p>
<p>i wish the experts would just come out and say it. but they tell us that its still spreadable and blahblahblah.  just say that your scared shitless to let us be free because shit could go pearshaped.  and let US DECIDE. fuck</p>

        <p>This doesn't address the issue that I raised, so I would appreciate it if you stopped engaging in strawman arguments. There is no question that coronaviruses can spread, the question was whether communal masking is an appropriate method to reduce the transmissibility of COVID-19 towards the start of the pandemic. It might shock you to learn that some viruses are more contagious than others, and that some viruses can remain airbourne or remain active in respiratory droplets for longer periods of time. You can't address the question of whether communal facemasks reduce the transmission of COVID-19, <strong>prior</strong> to the identification of COVID-19. Additionally, Dr. Fauci's issue with communal masking in March of 2020 didn't concern their efficacy, but rather that masking may reduce the availability of PPE for healthcare professionals and those who are particularly susceptible to infectious. It was then recommended that alternative cloth and homemade masks to be worn by the public in place of medical masks. Policy can only be informed on the current availability of data. It's absolutely mind blowing, I know!</p>

        <p>It is truly <strong>un-fucking-believable</strong> that you're all <strong>so</strong> incapable of understanding the very, very, <strong>very</strong> simple concept that information can change in light of the availability of new data and evidence. Literally every single response of mine in this thread is some variation of "information and policy changes with new evidence and data", yet here you are <strong>still</strong> conclusively demonstrating that you <strong>cannot</strong> understand this fact. It absolutely does <strong>not</strong> surprise me in the slightest that a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-57821-001">lack of education is strongly correlated with conspiracy theory beliefs</a>, considering the absurd degree of anti-intellectualism that I've experienced in this community.</p>

        <p>&rt; Mass masking by populations does not work. There is not a single example of it working. </p>
<p>How about the example of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32495332/">communal masking in Taiwan</a>, which was one of many effective intervention methods at reducing coronavirus transmissions, or <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33236940/">Japan's high compliance of communal masking</a> that was effective at reducing transmissions, or <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32540463/">South Korea maintaining a very low rate of transmission through high compliance of communal masking</a> early in the pandemic, or <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32725247/">China's incredibly high compliance of masking</a> that has resulted in returning the country to normality last year, or <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32725247/">how mask compliance increased in every country that showed a reduction in transmissions, yet compliance in the US and Europe remained low</a>? Whilst we're at it, why don't we just ignore the fact that the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/51/32293">introduction of a masking mandate reduced the infection rate in Germany by around 47%</a>, or the fact that COVID-19 transmission was <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/4/e2014564118">7.5 times higher in countries that did not have a masking mandate</a>, or the fact that transmission in the US states with a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0249891">high mask adherence policy observed 2.5 times fewer infections than states with much lower adherence</a>? </p>
<p>&rt; You show tiny studies on particulates spray reduction, that state In theory this should slow spread, not evidence of macro level infection reduction due to mask use, which there is none </p>
<p>It's very clear that you didn't understand and completely misinterpreted the purpose of my comment disputing that particular study. I wasn't attempting to demonstrate that masks reduce COVID-19 transmissions, I was demonstrating that the modes of interaction between exhalations and facemasks and their filtration obeys laws that comprehensively more complex than simply stipulating that COVID-19 diameter &lt; mask thread diameter = ineffective. This is lower than a high school understanding of physics, and their are numerous fluid dynamic processes and properties of facemasks that are completely ignored to arrive at this conclusion, such as the effects of surface tension, Darcy's flow through a porous medium, Brownian motion, droplet diffusion, just to name a minority of the ignored processes. I'm not at all surprised that you failed to understand my refutation of the article.</p>
<p>&rt; You can’t even show evidence of any corona virus measure working in the continental US or Europe, and attribute the success to any one effort. </p>
<p>A single non-pharmaceutical intervention method isn't responsible for a lowered infection rate, and it's fairly dishonest for you to try and imply this. COVID-19 transmission mitigation is the result of numerous intervention techniques, such as isolations, social distancing, traffic restriction, improved sanitary techniques, and mask mandates. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33129965/">This study that analysed 190 countries demonstrates that the coupling of the aforementioned methods can significantly impede COVID-19 transmission</a>, or <a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-020-01872-8">this study that suggests the same</a>, or <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30785-4/fulltext">this study</a>, or <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31142-9/fulltext">this one</a>, or <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bmb/article/136/1/46/5919554">this one</a>, and <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/48/30547">this one in fact</a>, and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32512579/">this one</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445320307568">etc</a>, <a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0040560">etc</a>.</p>
<p>&rt; Florida and California have functionally the same outcomes, despite being dead opposite </p>
<p>Sure, that's if bias dictates your selection of state for comparison. The fact that the rate of infection was 2.5 times higher in states that ignored the mask policy than those who adhered is evidence that you're talking out of your ass, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7766317/">and how this study also demonstrates that mask mandates and other strict policy responses dramatically altered the infection outcome between states.</a></p>
<p>&rt; Places that do well? Relatively isolated, or fast to utterly shut down travel </p>
<p>How about China? Thailand? UK? Hong Kong? Your logic isn't even consistent if I can name as many countries that you say support your claim, as I can to refute it.</p>
<p>&rt; Don’t act like you’re smart because you’ve latched on to a mainstream idea. You feel smart because you have numbers backing you. </p>
<p>This quote sums up the thought process of every conspiracy theorist really. I have numbers to back up my claim. It's true, I have an abundance of evidence on my side, which dictates my thought process when considering the COVID-19 pandemic. Is this an admission from yourself that you don't have any numbers, and therefore evidence to back up your conspiracy theories?</p>

<p>Speaking to you people really is like communicating with a brick wall. I'm just gonna go ahead and repeat myself for the umpteenth time to address the same claim that I've disputed time and time again. I <strong>very clearly</strong> stated that Dr. Fauci couldn't advise communal masking as he was concerned that medical masks and N95 respirators would be diverted from the people who required them more. Dr. Fauci then recommended communal masking using cloth masks, as there was an increasing amount of research that suggested that cloth masks were an appropriate alternative. My comments just seem to increasingly involve me repeating the same information ad-infinitum, since the reading skills of this community are absolutely dreadful.</p>
<p>&rt;You're arguing that Fauci knew that hospitals didn't have enough PPE to protect themselves from covid while simultaneously saying that he couldn't have known that PPE stops the spread of Covid. </p>
<p>Your comprehension skills. Look to improve them. He didn't <strong>know</strong> that hospitals didn't have enough PPE, he was <strong>concerned</strong> that resources would be diverted from the people who required them more. This is a <strong>big</strong> difference, that you are clearly struggling to understand.</p>
<p>&rt; You're just crazy and are defending a guy that put the country in danger because of his vague suggestions and multiple contradictions. </p>
<p>Again, policy-informed decision making can change with the availability of new data and evidence. I know this is unbelievably difficult for you people to understand, but it's absolutely true.</p>

This is a man that worked on coronaviruses for the most part of his miserable little life and i think he has personally killed thousands of people because of his shitty recommendations.</p>

<p>Wrong. Dr. Fauci was appointed as a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force in late January of 2020. You need to remember that the Trump administration overruled much of the advice of the CDC, and Dr. Fauci himself felt trapped within the Trump administration as he wasn't able to effectively communicate facts, science and information in regards to the coronavirus pandemic, out of fear that all of the advice would be discarded by Trump. Dr. Fauci said that he felt liberated after the Trump administration concluded, as he finally able to give fact-based advice without the anxiety of being repudiated directly by Trump. </p>
<p>It took a month to address the growing concern of whether communal masking was an effective intervention method to reduce COVID-19 transmission.</p>
<p>&rt;He didn't tell people to wear cloth covering, he didnt tell them to go out and buy N95's which were already in abundance on the market, he didnt tell the Trump Admin to start mass producing viral face masks in the thousands of factories he personally ordered locked down,</p>
<p>Again, I'm not sure how many times I'm gonna have to repeat this information, but the evidence that cloth masks were effective at reducing coronavirus transmission didn't exist at the time. You can't inform policy where the data and evidence doesn't exist. N95 respirators were primarily manufactured in Taiwan, to a high degree of rigour, and Taiwan had to apply a temporary ban on exporting the masks due to price gouging.</p>
<p>&rt;he didn't tell supermarkets to keep the doors open to get fresh air in...instead he told them to keep the doors closed because the "virus doesn't do well in warm air," which was the complete fkng opposite. </p>
<p>Can you provide a source for this?</p>
<p>&rt; This is a man that worked on coronaviruses for the most part of his miserable little life and i think he has personally killed thousands of people because of his shitty recommendations. </p>
<p>I mean, you don't even believe that masks are an effective non-pharmaceutical intervention method, which is in contrast to pretty much the entire scientific literature, so I don't think that you get to assess just how many people have died as a result of Dr. Fauci's recommendations. Tens of thousands more would have died if he hadn't recommended masking, and the countries response to vaccinating the population is truly incredible. Where the US truly had a humiliating response to intervention methods during the start of the pandemic under the Trump administration (the US never even left the first wave), the US is currently leading routine vaccinations in the global arena.</p>

        <p>I actually mixed you up with another brain dead conspiracy theorist. However, as conspiracy theorists have such a propensity to peddle disinformation, it doesn't even matter that I got you confused with someone else, because 95% of information that you people perpetuate is factually incorrect, so I can easily point to many areas of blatant misinformation by you, pretty much all of which I've already covered.</p>
<p>&rt; Fauci has been studying coronaviruses his entire life. </p>
<p>This is factually incorrect. He might be incredibly knowledgeable about coronaviruses, but his primary research concerns any prevalent infectious disease, pretty much all of which, are <strong>not</strong> coronaviruses. Having looked through his publications of scientific research articles, not a single one of them concerns a coronavirus. A few of them passively mention the SARS virus, but his primary research concerns HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, Ebola, Zika, influenza, etc. It was only recently where COVID-19 emerged as an infectious disease that his research became prevalent in a coronavirus.</p>
<p>&rt;You're arguing that Fauci knew that hospitals didn't have enough PPE to protect themselves from covid while simultaneously saying that he couldn't have known that PPE stops the spread of Covid. </p>
<p>This is a factually incorrect statement. I pointed out that Dr. Fauci was concerned that communal masking <strong>might</strong> divert PPE resources away from people who needed them more. This is not the same as saying that Dr. Fauci <strong>knew</strong> that hospitals didn't have enough PPE to protect themselves from COVID.</p>
<p>&rt; It took him 3 months to make a public statement and that was his oppurtunity to warn the public even though it was already too late to stop the spread. </p>
<p>This is technically misinformation, because it's based on the dishonest assumption that Dr. Fauci was in a position of power to warn the public about COVID-19 spreading from December 2019 to February 2020. He was appointed as a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force on January 29th 2020.</p>
<p>&rt; He didn't tell people to wear cloth covering </p>
<p>This is technically disinformation because, as I've pointed out countless times, decision-based policy can only be informed on the scientific data and evidence that is available at the time. When Dr. Fauci advised against the public from using medical masks and N95 respirators on the 8th of March, there was incredibly limited and insufficient evidence that communal masking with cloth-based masks were effective, but by the end of the month and throughout the following month, evidence began emerging that cloth mask alternatives could be an effective method of reducing COVID-19 transmissions.</p>
<p>&rt; he didnt tell them to go out and buy N95's which were already in abundance on the market </p>
<p>This is disinformation, since N95 respirators were most certainly <strong>not</strong> in abundance on the market. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32279694/">As this study indicates</a>, N95 respirators were in such short supply that healthcare workers were forced to recycle disposable single-use protective masks, and this was published on the 13th of April. Additionally, on the 9th of April, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/respirators-strategy/index.html">CDC advised guidance on how healthcare workers can optimise the use of N95 respirators,</a> considering the PPE was in such short supply. There are many reasons for the short supply, such as the Trump administration refusing to purchase the invention of a manufacturing technique that would produce 1.5 million N95 respirators a day in 2018, and the same administration didn't use the Defense Production Act until late March to produce the PPE, which was an incredibly late response to the issue, and hardly used the power for N95 respirators. The failings of the Trump administration are primarily responsible for the short supply of appropriate PPE.</p>
<p>&rt; he didnt tell the Trump Admin to start mass producing viral face masks in the thousands </p>
<p>This is a blatantly dishonest statement, as you are not aware of all of the private conversations that Dr. Fauci had with the Trump Administration in regards to the COVID-19 pandemic. The short supply of PPE for healthcare workers was a concern that Dr. Fauci even made public, and posted guidance on the optimisation of their use on the CDC website, so it's almost a certainty that he would have brought this very same issue up with Trump, since he doesn't have the authority to authorise the production of PPE. We all know how little Trump trusted Dr. Fauci, and he disregarded most of the life-saving advice that Dr. Fauci attempted to publicise. Trump acted too late to invoke the Defense Production Act.</p>
<p>&rt; he didn't tell supermarkets to keep the doors open to get fresh air in...instead he told them to keep the doors closed because the "virus doesn't do well in warm air," which was the complete fkng opposite. </p>
<p>I have strong reason to believe that this is disinformation, because not only am I unable to find any evidence Dr. Fauci made this claim, but I've also asked you directly for a source, and you've been unable to provide me with one. </p>
<p>&rt; Every argument you have is false and is directly off of CNN. </p>
<p>This is also a blatant attempt at misinformation to discredit the factual information that I've been providing, and I'm fairly certain that the last time I even visited a CNN website or video was prior to this pandemic.</p>
<p>&rt; You also strangely keep ignoring the fact that he told people not to wear masks even after he was put on the task force. </p>
<p>I don't need to explain any more times that this statement is blatant misinformation.</p>

        <p>This is honestly a truly pathetic attempt to discredit Dr. Fauci. Policy is informed and altered based on the continued development of data. This might shock you, but less was known about COVID-19 towards the start of the pandemic than what we understand about the virus today. </p>
<p>Can you imagine if a scientist was so close-minded that they were unable to change their position on anything? That's possibly the <strong>absolute worst</strong> quality you can possess as a scientist, especially someone who is an advisor of science. The fact that Dr. Fauci was humble enough to readily change his positions based on the availability of new data is an incredibly positive aspect for informing up-to-date policy-based decisions, yet you're here trying to discredit him for exhibiting a characteristic that is indicative of any good scientist. There is no wonder that you're all peddling an incredible degree of anti-science and disinformation if you believe that open-mindedness is such a detrimental quality of any scientist.</p>

        <p>Parroting the fact that Dr. Fauci is open-minded enough to change his mind on informing policy decisions based on the change in scientific data is a <strong>good</strong> thing, and doesn't make you appear clever, nor at all intelligent. Also, don't misquote Dr. Fauci to try and further your false narrative that open-mindedness is somehow a detrimental quality.</p>
<p>Dr. Fauci did <strong>not</strong> state that people should "absolutely not wear a mask", like you're trying to falsely peddle. The correct quote is that Dr. Fauci stated that "there's no reason to be walking around with a mask", adding that although he's not against masks, he is simply worried about health care professionals and sick people requiring their use, and that communal masking may lead to unintended consequences.</p>
<p>Additionally, Dr. Fauci didn't say that "you <strong>have</strong> to wear two masks", he simply implied that wearing multiple masks increases the filtration efficiency of said masks, as common sense and the research literature abundantly indicates. Therefore, he <strong>encouraged</strong>, but did <strong>not</strong> mandate the use of multiple masks.</p>
<p>Look, I am absolutely not expecting you people to be competent enough to maintain any degree of accuracy when your goal is to intentionally peddle disinformation, but this honestly embarrassing.</p>

        <p>I know this incredibly difficult for you people to understand because you clearly have such a terrible understanding of science, but you can neither inform policy-based decisions, nor make any affirmative scientific claim with a lack of evidence and availability of data. Where the data was severely lacking in terms of facemask efficacy at reducing COVID-19 transmission during the beginning of the pandemic, the abundance of research that was released in the wake of the pandemic on mask efficacy re-informed the policy of wearing masks. It's that simple, really. You don't need to have even graduated high school to understand this incredibly rudimentary concept, but I know much you're all struggling with this fact.</p>
<p>Additionally, the claim of no evidence of human-to-human transmission was from the WHO, not Dr. Fauci, which was based on research by Chinese epidemiologists towards the very beginning of the pandemic. This claim was made on the 31st of December, when there was only <strong>27 confirmed cases</strong> of COVID-19. At this point, it honestly feels like I'm trying to communicate with a brick wall considering how dishonest you all are, and how often I have to repeat myself to you people, but the claim that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission was <strong>correct</strong> at the time the research was released, and was subsequently dismissed based on the <strong>availability of new data</strong>.</p>
<p>Who made the claim not to take vitamins to boost the immune system? I would like a source on that, if you will. In a thread that addresses the policy advise of Dr. Fauci, I'm curious as to why you've not only parroted a claim that he never made, but why you included an additional two claims that were apparently not attributed to him?</p>

        <p>When you have a lack of insight, or a lack of data, you don’t go around making affirmative claims. You can err on the side of caution, or you can admit you don’t have the data.

Things that have been proven to be safe and extremely effective. I’m not going to spoon feed you links, because if you cared about truth, you could find them yourself.</p>

<p>No, he didn't. Dr. Fauci expressed concern that communal masking will divert the resources from healthcare workers and those susceptible to infection that might require them. His stance changed when research into the cheap alternatives of cloth masks at reducing COVID-19 transmission began emerging. You can pretend that Dr. Fauci claimed multiple times that masks were ineffective, and that his stance flipped "without reason", but this is just yet again another example of peddling disinformation to discredit Dr. Fauci.</p>

<p>Can you provide me evidence that "big tech" is censoring the efficacy of the aforementioned treatments? We already know that hydroxychloroquine is highly ineffective, and even detrimental to patient health in treating COVID-19.</p>
<p>&rt;Sure, big tech isn’t run by Fauci </p>

        <p>Let's go through your dishonest statements again then, shall we?</p>
<p>You made this comment towards the start of the discussion:</p>
<p>&rt; Faucci made the affirmative claim that masks don’t work over and over, and then flipped his stance 180 degrees, without reason. </p>
<p>This is a factually incorrect statement. Dr. Fauci advised against wearing masks on the 8th of March 2020 because he believed they would divert PPE away from healthcare workers and people who are of a higher priority, which is in contrast to the misinformation that you're peddling about Dr. Fauci claiming that masks don't work "over and over". Additionally, you mention that Dr. Fauci flipped his stance 180 degrees "without reason", which is also a factually incorrect statement. The reason that Dr. Fauci changed his position about masks was because he was in active talks with the White House coronavirus task force, and determined that the evidence for the efficacy of communal masking was favourable. He was quoted as saying "The idea of getting a much more broad, community-wide use of masks outside of the health care setting is under very active discussion at the task force. The CDC group is looking at that very carefully" in regards to this issue, and went on to say "But even the slight aerosol in which you're talking to somebody. If that's the case, we should at least look at the data and try to make a decision about that.", followed by "Something doesn't have to be 100% effective to be beneficial". These statements by Dr. Fauci directly contradict your false claim that he changed his mind "without reason".</p>
<p>You then made the following claim, particularly about hydroxychloroquine:</p>
<p>&rt; As for the claims about vitamins, big tech was and still is censoring all kinds of content that spoke to the efficacy of vitamin D, zinc, ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine etc. </p>
<p>Hydroxychloroquine has been very well established to be a detrimental treatment method for COVID-19, as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7813508/">this study</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7267640/">this study</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7207200/">this study</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7138336/">this study</a>, <a href="https://www.recoverytrial.net/news/statement-from-the-chief-investigators-of-the-randomised-evaluation-of-covid-19-therapy-recovery-trial-on-hydroxychloroquine-5-june-2020-no-clinical-benefit-from-use-of-hydroxychloroquine-in-hospitalised-patients-with-covid-19">this study</a>, and <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763802">this study</a> indicate, so "big tech" didn't have anything to censor. They were reporting factually correct information.</p>
<p>&rt; Sure, big tech isn’t run by Faucci, but they clearly have the exact same agenda, and he refuses to endorse anything that will help strengthen the immune system naturally. </p>
<p>This is a straight up lie. <a href="https://www.health.com/nutrition/vitamins-supplements/dr-fauci-vitamin-c-and-d">Dr. Fauci endorsed vitamin C and D to help boost your immune system in light of COVID-19.</a></p>
<p>&rt; You haven’t refuted a single one of my claims. </p>
<p>This is the final claim that it factually incorrect that you are desperately trying to peddle. You ran away from the discussion very early on, so out of the little information that you provided to me, I managed to find this much disinformation with your statements. I'm glad we were finally able to determine that for a second time, just how dishonest you are at propagating disinformation. It's good that we are able to address your dishonesty again, so thanks for encouraging the opportunity.</p>

        <p>Nah Pfizer just slipped a couple mil into his bank account for him to parrot whatever they want him to say. After all, is it really a pharmaceutical corporation without a little bribery?</p>
