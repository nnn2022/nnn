    <strong>Can people stop posting far fetched shit in this sub? (Read text before downvote)</strong>
    <p><p>I'm as anti lockdown/anti social distancing as they come. I'm also against mask mandates and forced vaccinations. However I've been hearing the dumbest shit on this sub like comparing masks to slavery, and lockdown to the holocaust. Yeah this shit is dystopian and tyranny, but comparing it to things out of its league just make our cause look bad. If our purpose is get to more people on our side we gotta stop with the dumb shit. Like honestly it's why this sub gets brigaded but r/CoronavirusCirclejerk and r/LockdownSkepticism don't</p></p>

        <p>Nazi Germany (or whatever) didn't appear from a vacuum. People want to discuss consequences, comparisons with history and a major concern of situations like these are what they can potentially lead to. Not what they will definitely lead to, but 'never again' is best achieved by preventing secret hitler from getting the kind of power that is required to enact the killing fields, and this is best done by preventing anyone, for any reason, from having that kind of power.</p>
<p>Also as you said yourself, more normie friendly subs exist. The smaller number who come here do so to be more free with the discussion.</p>

        <p>IIt's literally the birth of a new strain of the common cold. Learning to live with it means going back to 2019 normal and acknowledging this for what it is. But for some bizarre reason, these psychopaths want to restructure society to revolve around a 0.1% IFR virus. As long as they are obsessed with it, treat it like it's ebola, then this hideous dystopia will continue. Social distancing, masks, harassment by Covidians, lockdowns, testing, isolating, counting cases, contact tracing, plexiglass, temperature checks, disinfecting everything, proof of vaccination, covid papers so you can work and travel (just like Nazi Germany!) and the rest of the psychotic stupid voodoo will be accepted as part of the "new normal" so no one catches the big, bad scary cold virus... because apparently either they never knew that respiratory viruses existed, or these "experts" were all lobotomized back in March, or covid is literally the worst disease to ever befall the human race and thus we need to completely change the way we live to accommodate it. That's what the science says! What does the word even mean anymore? Someone wake me up from this nightmare hell. It's beyond absurd at this point. How is any of this shit even real?</p>

        <p>I don't speak for all mods but I'll remove borderline graphically offensive comparisons to either slavery or the Holocaust but for the most part I personally opt for less censorship than more. Reddit has a builtin user content curating system (up/down votes) so if people like/dislike something I leave it to them to handle it.</p>

        <p>The Holocaust went from 1941 to 1945. I’m comparing what’s going on now to mid-1930s Nazi Germany. Even <em>they</em> didn’t have face mandates.</p>

        <p>Not to mention that lessons can be learned from the social behavior of the average German citizen during 
the Third Reich. 
Honestly there will possibly be more dead with lockdowns than the Holocaust. It’s an ugly truth that few are talking about. This does not diminish the reverence  for Jews and others who died in Nazi Germany. In fact it would be dishonorable to those killed, not to learn from their tragic fate.</p>

        <p>Agreed. Considering that we are NOT replacing the income of people who worked for small, deemed 'non-essential' businesses I would not be surprised if we have more people dead from being kicked out of their homes into the cold, starvation, etc. at the end of this bullcrap than from CoVid-19.</p>

        <p>Look back in history, specifically Nazi germany like someone mentioned. Mass propaganda, and, eventually, the brainwash of thousands of innocent young men to slaughter millions. </p>
<p>We’re seeing indoctrination and propaganda in the media right now. </p>
<p>Spooky, but dismissible. Less than the fact that there are two narratives. One that plays out a virus being deadly, the necessity of lockdowns, the eventual necessity of vaccinations, restrictions on travel (and basic rights). </p>
<p>The other says that this is not what it’s made out to be. That we need to resist what they are ordering from us. That if we don’t, we will face tourment. </p>
<p>Which side you choose I suppose will depend on where you consume your information. But know that only one of these sides has an incentive for deception.</p>

        <p>1.5 million people have died, It's not a joke for you to rebel upon. The Governments around the world and especially in USA (despite their history) are actually trying to protect the world.</p>
<p>And I don't even have any words for you on your "Holocaust = Corona Crisis" part. How is it propanganda and indoctrination to save human lives? Y'all really sound like the anti-vaxxers that reignited the measles outbreak here in the US.</p>
<p>People quarantined and successfully weakened the spread of H1N1 in the early 1900's, why can't you? Let this pandemic die off for fuck sake.</p>

<p>10's of millions of people are going to die as a result of the collateral damage from their measures, astronomically more than how many will die from the alleged pandemic. Is this not equivalent to a holocaust or genocide.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, it's a slippery slope. Almost all totalitarian regimes didn't just start out as insane as they ended. They started out being mild, liberal even maybe just a little too far. </p>
<p>But they could not just outright reveal their plans until they were firmly in power. </p>
<p>It's because people then still had some rights, they weren't the dominant voice. They were maybe imposing some fairly light restrictions that only tightened as time went by. And it's in that, as time went by. </p>
<p>So, if we don't stop now, it starts a precedent. And a precedent is dangerous, in every sense. Because they now have the right to justify under the pretense that it's been done before and nothing happened even when they may never intend to give them back this time. </p>
<p>And they can go even harder and more draconian. The lockdowns have already been representative of that, it was a steady erosion of rights. First, get them to buy that it's temporary then move onto just to dragging it out until it never ends. </p>
<p>Comparing it isn't the best, but we're becoming more and more like that with each passing day. With every place tightening things up, adding new legislation that would make dictators happy.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure people are comparing lockdowns to the holocaust but the fact that elderly people and children are the first victims (nursing home genocide, and the cancellation of school, libraries, forced medicine for children) these are true parallels to Nazism. Believe whatever you want, but when people are appalled at the comparison of Nazism to what is happening today-what they actually should be appalled about is what is happening in the world today.</p>

        <p>How do you think Nazi Germany got to the point it did? It wasn't overnight. You admit yourself the snitching is similar, that's how it started back then as well.</p>

        <p>Umm actually comparing noneffective mask to slavery is quite in place. In some places they won't let you have a proper n95 mask ,but they will force you to have their little slave face diaper. It's not about the virus it's only about breaking up bodily autonomy. The fact that in some places ppl can't practcally  leave their home or region for almost a yr and forcing ppl to use tracking apps is pretty slavery like as well.</p>
<p>Comparison of lockdown pushers and other tyranny to fascist regimes is becoming more and more accurate day by day as well. There are already places when you will get arrested for wrong thinking and it wouldn't surprise me if we'd see the correction camps for the wrong thinkers as well if that continues to escalate in such pace as it does now.</p>
