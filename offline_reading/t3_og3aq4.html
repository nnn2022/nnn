        <h2>1933: Dr. Frederick L. Gates died “due to a fractured skull and brain hemorrhage.” ^1</h2>
<p><strong>1917:</strong> Dr. Gates was a Yale &amp; Johns Hopkins grad, <strong>employed by Rockefeller Institute,</strong> as a physician and scientist, assigned to the Base Hospital in <strong>Fort Riley, Kansas</strong> where an <strong>experimental Rockefeller vaccine</strong> was administered and “coincidentally” the <strong>“Spanish” Flu</strong> is believed to have <strong>originated.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Gates’ father</strong>, [Rev. Frederick Taylor Gates],(https://rockfound.rockarch.org/biographical/-/asset_publisher/6ygcKECNI1nb/content/frederick-t-gates) was the principal business advisor of John D. Rockefeller, Sr., from 1891 to 1923.</p>
<p>While at Yale, <strong>Dr. Gates received the Andrew Dickson White award</strong>. White was a member of <strong>The Order of Skull &amp; Bones</strong> and…</p>
<p>&rt;”…first President of Cornell University and first President of the American Historical Association.”^2</p>
<h2>Dr. Fred L. Gates, Rockefeller Institute, Fort Riley and the “Spanish” Flu</h2>
<p>1918: Rockefeller Institute administered an <strong>experimental meningitis vaccine</strong> in Fort Riley, Kansas, <strong>cultured in horses</strong>, that afflicted many with <strong>flu-like symptoms.</strong> </p>

<p><em>By Frederick L. Gates, M.D.</em></p>
<p>First Lieutenant, Medical Corps, US. . Army.
(From the Base Hospital, Fort Riley Kansas, and The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, New York.)”</p>
<h2>Dr. Gates’ brother...</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/35218032/franklin-herbert-gates">Franklin Herbert Gates</a> was a Yale graduate.
&rt;“In 1926 he became a second vice-president in charge of new business activities, and later he was promoted to full vice-president of the bank.”</p>
<p><strong>In 1901, Rev. Frederick T. Gates designed the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (now Rockefeller University), of which he was board president.</strong> He then designed the Rockefeller Foundation, becoming a trustee upon its creation in 1913.</p>
<p><strong>Professor John Oxford states:</strong> </p>
<p>&rt;”The 1918 pandemic was huge. I’ve spent a lot of my life working on it, <strong>I’ve even exhumed people who died in 1918 to get virus RNA from them.</strong> When trying to understand where the virus came from, how it did what it did, and where it went to, we end-up grappling with death-toll. Estimates of the number of deaths range from 40-100 million. In some ways, <a href="https://thoughteconomics.com/virus-pandemics/">this virus was so big that we’ve all decided that something else must have happened- a unique set of circumstances in 1918.”</a></p>
<p><strong>A “unique set of circumstances” like a botched Rockefeller Institute vaccine?</strong></p>
<p><em>Historian, Antony C. Sutton writes:</em></p>
<p>&rt;”<strong>American Medical Association</strong></p>
<p>&rt;Your doctor knows nothing about nutrition? Ask him confidentially and he'll probably confess he had only one course in nutrition. And there's a reason. ^2</p>
<p>&rt;Back in the late 19th century American medicine was in a deplorable state. To the credit of the Rockefeller General Education Board and the Institute for Medical Research, funds were made available to staff teaching hospitals and to eradicate some pretty horrible diseases. On the other hand, a chemical-based medicine was introduced and the medical profession cut its ties with naturopathy. Cancer statistics tell you the rest.</p>
<p>&rt;For the moment we want only to note that <strong>the impetus for reorganizing medical education in the United States came from John D. Rockefeller, but the funds were channeled through a single member of The Order.”</strong></p>
<p>&rt;“One day in 1912 <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Taylor_Gates">Frederick T. Gates</a> of Rockefeller Foundation had lunch with <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Flexner">Abraham Flexner</a> of Carnegie Institution. Said Gates to Flexner: </p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”What would you do if you had one million dollars with which to make a start in reorganizing medical education in the United States?"</strong></p>
<p>&rt;“Flexner's reply, however, to the effect that any funds -- <strong>a million dollars or otherwise -- could most profitably be spent in <a href="https://rockfound.rockarch.org/public-health-at-johns-hopkins">developing the Johns Hopkins Medical School,</a> struck a responsive chord in Gates who was already a close friend and devoted admirer of Dr. William H. Welch, the dean of the institution."</strong></p>
<p>&rt;Welch was President of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research from 1901, and a Trustee of the Carnegie Institution from 1906.”</p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Welch">William H. Welch</a> was also a member of <a href="https://archive.org/details/AmericasSecretEstablishmentOrderOfSkullbones/page/n3/mode/1up">the Order</a> and had been brought to Johns Hopkins University by <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Coit_Gilman">Daniel Coit Gilman.”</a></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”There is an Establishment history, an official history,</strong> which dominates history textbooks, trade publishing, the media and library shelves. <strong>The official line always assumes that events such as wars, revolutions, scandals, assassinations, are more or less random unconnected events. By definition events can NEVER be the result of a conspiracy, they can never result from premeditated planned group action.</strong> An excellent example is the Kennedy assassination when, within 9 hours of the Dallas tragedy, TV networks announced the shooting was NOT a conspiracy, regardless of the fact that a negative proposition can never be proven, and that the investigation had barely begun. </p>
<p>&rt;Woe betide any book or author that falls outside the official guidelines. Foundation support is not there. Publishers get cold feet.  Distribution is hit and miss, or non-existent. </p>
<p>&rt;Just to ensure the official line dominates, <strong>in 1946 the Rockefeller Foundation allotted $139,000 for an official history of World War Two. This to avoid a repeat of debunking history books which embarrassed the Establishment after World War One.</strong> The reader will be interested to know that The Order we are about to investigate had great foresight, back in the 1880s, to create both the American Historical Association and the American Economic Association (most economists were then more historians than analysts) under their terms, with their people and their objectives. <strong>Andrew Dickson White was a member of The Order and the first President of the American Historical
Association.”</strong></p>
<h2>Johns Hopkins connected to Skull &amp; Bones since 1876 and Rockefeller since 1910</h2>
<p><strong>The school’s first president was “Bonesman”</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/lgs7k5/johns_hopkins_connected_to_skull_bones_since_1876/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">Daniel Coit Gilman.</a></p>
<p><em>Eustace Mullins writes</em></p>
<p>&rt;”The <strong>Flexner Report</strong> was completed in 1910, after many months of travel and study. It was heavily influenced by the <strong>German-trained allopathic representation in the American medical profession.</strong> It was later revealed that <strong>the primary influence on Flexner had been his trip to Baltimore. He had been a graduate of Johns Hopkins University.</strong> This school had been established by Daniel Coit Gilman (1831-1908). <strong>Gilman had been one of the three original incorporators of the Russell Trust at Yale University (now known as the Brotherhood of Death).</strong> Its Yale headquarters had a letter in German <strong>authorizing Gilman to set up this branch of the Illuminati in the United States.</strong> ^3:172</p>
<p>&rt;Gilman incorporated the Peabody Fund and the John Slater Fund, which <strong>later became the Rockefeller Foundation.</strong> Gilman also became an original incorporator of Rockefeller's General Education Board, which was to take over the United States system of medical education; the Carnegie Foundation and the Russell Sage Foundation.”</p>
<p>&rt;“The <strong>emphasis on drugs and experimentation</strong> which originated with the German allopathic school of medicine, and which was brought to this hemisphere by <strong>Illuminati initiates such as Daniel Coit Gilman,</strong> was the first step in <strong>transforming the entire medical practice of the United States</strong> from a patient-oriented, healing process to a totally different approach, in which <strong>the patient became an instrument to be manipulated for the benefit of various other programs, mainly experimental science.”</strong></p>
