        <p>Well, my grandma died "from" Covid.</p>
<p>The best part? She got it - IN THE HOSPITAL. After months of obeying rules and wearing masks - she fell alone at home and broke her hip. She had to go get a surgery. She tested NEGATIVE before being admitted to the hospital where she was for 7 days. She tested positive on 8th day, and died 3 days later due to complications.</p>
<p>So who am I to fucking blame? Myself for not wearing a mask?</p>
<p>And I still think all of this is bullshit. She was 85. She was begging for past 3 years that something kills her because she was in constant pain from underlying conditions fucking her up. </p>
<p>I don't get these people, what do they think living life at age of 65+ is "fucking great"??? XD</p>
<p>i wanna hear the next part of the plan where we outlaw breeding because children that are born can die and we can't let anyone die!!!!  makes so much sense this line of reasoning.</p>
<p>I have an uncle who committed suicide because of a shitty marriage he was in... so should we stop everything until everyone is living in a sucessfull marriage as well? XD</p>
<p>how do these morons even make it through the day in real life is beyond me... oh right, they don't live in real life, they live in imaginary bubbles of concepts only possible since society protects them... they wouldn't last 5 days in real world if "mommy society" wasnt there to tell them how to feel and behave... what a sad pathetic sack of shit this entire civilization is I swear, we deserve no better as long as we will allow these kretens to emotionally blackmail people into obedience... fuck this shit.</p>
<p>Fuck society.</p>

        <p>I assume you were 'calling out' me? Yeah, you probably got downvoted for it because you were being a royal horse's rear and attacking someone whose parents died due to this virus who is actually ON YOUR SIDE as far as the masks and lockdowns go, seeing them as unnecessary.</p>

        <p>Yes I was calling you out. And no I wasn’t being a “horses rear”, you goddam child. I said to you “You’ve been spouting this statistic on nearly every post in this sub for the last few hours. Where are you getting these numbers from?” I asked you a simple question. Didn’t get a response (I’m assuming because you invented these numbers you’re going on about) and only got downvoted. So take your sob story somewhere else you fuckin poser.</p>

        <p>There is no such thing as 0 cases until they stop testing.
Governments are slowing the spread, it can’t ever reach 0 cases. Everyone will get it, through injection or naturally.  Death is normal part of life. Covid media just makes it fashionable to believe that it was totally preventable. If this were because of the flu last year, would you ask everyone to stay home and close their businesses and cut all outside social contact to cure humanity of the flu? The primary reason to slow the spread is to keep people scared and sell the vaccine. </p>
<p>The biggest comorbidities are personally preventable conditions like heart disease and obesity. If someones loved ones lives mattered so much, what effort went into prevention of these comorbidities. </p>
<p>I’m not saying deaths aren’t tragic. However, every one of us will die at some point, so no one can act like it will never happen. It happens everyday from negligence of other people or corporations, Plane crash, drunk driver. Should we stop letting anyone with a drivers license from having any alcohol to get drunk driver deaths to 0? Should we ground all planes until they are 100% safe. Maybe just ban all cars too, then all automobile deaths would be 0. It will degrade the quality of everyones lives, but there is no cost too high to prevent deaths. Right?</p>
