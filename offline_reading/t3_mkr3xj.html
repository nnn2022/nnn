    <strong>The SPARS Pandemic 2025-2028 John Hopkins Simulation</strong>
    <p><p>For those that are familiar with the Rockefeller Foundation's <a href="http://www.nommeraadio.ee/meedia/pdf/RRS/Rockefeller%20Foundation.pdf">Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development</a> document from May 2010, which eerily envisioned <em>"a future where a pandemic would allow national leaders to flex their authority and impose airtight rules and restrictions that would remain even after the pandemic faded"</em>.  Sound familiar?</p>
<p>This paper from 2017 is much of the same, even containing containing an entire sub-section on "vaccine injury" and saying:</p>
<p><em>"As time passed and more people across the United States were vaccinated, claims of adverse side effects began to emerge. Several parents claimed that their children were experiencing neurological symptoms similar to those seen among livestock exposed to the GMI vaccine. By May 2027, parental anxiety around this claim had intensified to the point of lawsuits. That month, a group of parents whose children developed mental retardation as a result of encephalitis in the wake of Corovax vaccination sued the federal government, demanding removal of the liability shield protecting the pharmaceutical companies responsible for developing and manufacturing Corovax."</em></p>
<p>Since some of these research or "exercise" papers have proven to be more akin to real-life war game scenario planning, it makes sense to get familiar with what are potential blueprints for upcoming events, so you may effectively counter-plan against and resist them.</p>

        <p>Judith Ronin, once president of the Rockefeller Institute, had several donations to her University in Pennsylvania from several racist groups. She full on supports Eugenics like all these other "heads of medical establishments."</p>
<p>https://www.influencewatch.org/non-profit/rockefeller-foundation/</p>
<p>Rockefeller Institute was founded on Eugenics, and now runs the medical establishment. </p>
<p>Kinda how Pfizer has lied for profits at the detriments of patients several times <em>(as recently as 2018 if you don't count toxicity studies skipped for Covid)</em> and people still want a "vaccine." <em>Can't even blame BigPharma at this point because it is a tried and true system of profit without the potential of litigation apparently.</em></p>

        <p>I’m worried about these kids and babies they’re testing the vaccine on right now. I wonder if it will wind up being as controversial as the MMR shot was for a while.</p>

        <p>They are also really pushing the "new variants" are now affecting children storyline on mainstream news. Now that they've effectively culled a portion of seniors in care residences, they are going after children and pregnant women.</p>

<p>It's wild how this mirrors the COVID-19 narritive down to the smallest details. I suggest everyone take some time to read through this "scenerio"</p>
