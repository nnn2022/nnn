    <strong>Is old normal just a carrot on a stick?</strong>
    <p><p>One of the things that bugs me the most about the whole hysteria is how much governors, national leaders, and health experts have been committing the logical fallacy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_the_goalposts">moving the goalposts</a>; that is to say, changing the goal of a process (the removal of pandemic-related restrictions and the return to a pre-pandemic society) while it is still ongoing. If they had stuck with the <em>one</em> criteria for removing public health measures, such as lockdown, and returning back to normal, that they had chosen from the outset, I might have been more likely to favor of their actions.</p>
<p>The problem is, however, that they haven't. Anyone remember what the how this madness was sold in the beginning, or recall how long they said it would last? They were telling us that it would be "two weeks", "15 days to stop the spread", or something like that, just as a simple safety measure to prevent hospitals from overflowing and our areas from becoming the next China or Italy, after which lockdowns would be lifted and everything would return to normal. Was that reasonable? Hey, it was only two weeks out of 52 in a year, we thought. <em>We could live with that</em>, we decided, <em>couldn't we?</em></p>
<p>Alas, what a hopeless fantasy that was. Two weeks passed... <em>but we didn't go back to normal.</em> <em>Sure</em>, we thought, <em>two weeks was just an estimate; if it ultimately takes more than two weeks for hospital capacity to decrease, that's fine</em>. We eagerly watched the hospital capacities, which eventually went down... but we didn't go back to normal. How can we reopen, asked the leaders, if we're still seeing <em>this many</em> deaths in our area? Deaths decreased... <em>but we didn't go back to normal.</em> How can we reopen, asked the leaders, if we're still seeing <em>this many</em> cases in our area? Cases took a bit longer to decrease. However, they eventually did... <em>but we didn't go back to normal.</em></p>
<p>Test and trace, cried the health experts. That's the only way to end lockdowns, because now we know about asymptomatic transmission. Labs manufactured tests at breakneck speed. Corporations began to roll out special apps for testing and tracing purposes, and some downloaded them. Soon, testing capacity had increased significantly, doubling or even tripling in certain cases, to a point where the virus began to reveal itself as harmless for most people... <em>but we didn't go back to normal.</em></p>
<p>By now, the current goalpost, "...until a vaccine", seemed stronger than others. How far could the goalposts really shift after that? That was as far as the doomers of March had gone when referencing end dates to the lockdown: "oh no this will last 18 months because that's how long a vaccine will take". Once the vaccine was finished, which could be sooner than we used to think, and with maybe an extra few months or so to allow for distribution, the pandemic - and the accompanying panic - would be over and done with for all practical purposes, and we could return to our normal lives. Maybe with a little extra emphasis on hand-washing and other basic hygiene, and perhaps <em>optional</em> mask-wearing for <em>sick</em> people, but that was as far as it would go.</p>
<p>Yet, as stable as that goalpost has seemed, even <em>it</em> has moved in recent weeks. The shift was originally confined to auxiliary opinion editorials here and there, but then those became more common, and more solid, until finally, Dr. Tam and Dr. Fauci - the national infectious disease experts of the US and Canada respectively - came clear and said it aloud themselves. <strong>Apparently, a vaccine is not a "silver bullet", meaning that even</strong> <strong><em>after</em></strong> <strong>the fabled vaccine comes out, we'll need to retain certain pandemic practices, such as 6-foot/2-meter distancing, mask-wearing, and reduced capacity in businesses such as restaurants, shopping centers, and the like.</strong> Today, Russia has announced their victory in the vaccine race. Has anything changed, though, especially outside of Russia? Not really. This is supposed to be a grand milestone in the pandemic... but we didn't go back to normal.</p>
<p>So does that mean our efforts to resist the "new normal" have been futile? Unfortunately, with every day of the sustained lockdowns and additional closures and cancellations that passes, the answer to that question is looking more and more like <em>yes</em>. But when will we return to normal? As much as you might not want to hear my answer to this question, <strong><em>probably never</em></strong>. I know I'm posting this in a place dedicated to <em>rejecting</em> the new normal, but [we have to be realistic] (https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/i3i6zq/its_important_to_be_realistic/), and understand that no matter what we do, no matter how hard we fight the good fight, there will always be certain things the government will henceforth do that we might not like, and there will be at least <em>one</em> thing - I don't know what it is; it might be negligible, it might have a significant impact on your personal life - different from pre-pandemic life. <strong>Yes, it's a bitter pill to swallow, but we all have to take it if you don't want this sub to turn into an echo chamber, like many a sub these days.</strong> We can stop the new normal from becoming dark and dystopian (and I can't even guarantee that we'll win <em>that</em> battle), <em>but unfortunately, preventing the new normal entirely is simply not an option</em>. We shouldn't be asking ourselves "will we have a new normal?" Instead, we should be asking ourselves "what will the new normal be like, and how can we cope with it?"</p>
<p>I am convinced that, in spite of the facetious "goalposts" they toss out, this hysteria will never end, and we will never return to how things were before the pandemic. As a matter of fact, I'm sure that this <em>had been</em> the governments' original plan: <em>Oh look, there's an emergency. Let's use the emergency as a</em> <strong><em>pretext</em></strong> <em>for permanently remaking society.</em> But they couldn't just say that they were never going to bring everything back in the beginning, otherwise people wouldn't comply. So they sold the lockdown and new normal as temporary, and used "old normal" as a carrot on a stick to encourage compliance: "We can go back to normal in this many weeks... but only if we all behave!" Fast forward to this many weeks later: "Well guys, we <em>could</em> have gone back to normal by now, but you weren't behaving. More lockdown for you!" These types of goals are in tandem with the other goalposts mentioned above concerning cases or vaccines or whatever; there is no contradiction. "We have fewer cases today; thank you all for following my rules. Keep it up and we can go back to normal." Only, we can't. They have every excuse whatsoever to extend the new normal when the current goalpost does arrive.</p>
<p>Feel free to call me a doomer; in fact, feel free to call me <em>anything</em>. I've been an active member of this sub for a while, so don't go around thinking that I'm sort of troll. All I'm saying is, if you would like to preserve your mental health and avoid disappointment when things don't go your way, you <em>might</em> need to lower your expectations a little.</p></p>

        <p>If you’re waiting for permission to go back to normal, it won’t happen.  The only way is to live absolutely as normally as possible. As you do, others will tire of this nonsense and they’ll start living more normally too. If you’re going to comply and wait for permission, you may as well just get used to new normal.  But I know there are millions of us that aren’t accepting this.  We’re going back to normal.</p>

        <p>I agree 100%.  I live my life completely as normal (no masks, no hiding at home, etc.), and am vocal about it on my social media in the hopes that it will catch on.   There was a discussion on one of my local city's biggest Facebook groups about how they're scared that "they" are going to cancel Halloween.   People were flummoxed when I suggested there was no "they" who could cancel Halloween, unless of course they force us back into lockdown (33 cases yesterday in Ontario, 90 today, population 14,500,000) Australia-styles and start arresting anyone who trick or treats.  These people are convinced that the government has ultimate power over them and they just have to lay down and do as they're told.  Mind boggling.</p>

        <p>I go out without a mask all time. I live fairly normally.  We had some businesses reopen during “red phase” lockdown and the state didn’t do shit.  It’s like an empty gun.  It’s all mind control.  Wanting you to think they can send the national guard.  Please.</p>

        <p>Yup, I agree with you, and it's why I'm loud on social media about my civil disobedience.</p>
<p>They want you to feel alone and isolated, and that your desires to live are just selfishness and should be repressed. Seeing others speak breaks that illusion.</p>
<p>The only way out of this situation without blood is disobedience. The state does not have enough manpower to crush you. If enough people want to live life as normal, it will become unenforceable and hence void.</p>
<p>The only thing that scares me is fascist hellholes like Australia.</p>

        <p>A Canadian friend who currently lives in Melbourne posted an "infographic" regarding the very real 20,000 cases that have been avoided just since July 8, 2020, thanks to the current fascist regime, and praising it.  Based on computer modelling, I assumed.   Since we were looking at computer modelling, I asked her where Sweden was hiding their 100,000 dead, and strangely enough, I didn't get any response.</p>

        <p>I am somewhere in NSW Australia. Most people are out living as usual where I am, and have been acting normally the entire time. No distancing. No treating each other like the plague. Talking to strangers - yes, up close. There were parties at homes and in public. Gatherings. People were out living. Crowded markets are happening now where everyone just ignores social distancing signs, they're merely there to make it look like the markets should be allowed. The entire time so many elderly were out and about, they were not afraid to come right up to me and have conversations. I talk to elderly people a lot, I figure when I'm old I hope younger people talk to me. </p>
<p>People for the most part never followed shit in the first place in my area. Openly flaunted it. Enjoyed seeing others flaunting it.</p>
<p>There's a minority are people who are clearly under the fear spell, but more of that minority are waking up. I have helped some do so, it's easier in real life than online tbh. A lady who works at a major retailer who I've become sort of friends with, I threw some facts at her one day when she was talking about it all, things clearly from the media. And she feels better, looked into things herself and doesn't get the science stuff entirely but it still makes sense.</p>
<p>Sure being in NSW Australia our premier could go full psycho and try to turn us into Victoria at any moment, and that's something I am struggling with mentally and I've gone downhill to a point I am suicidal. Walking on egg shells because depsite people flaunting the rules the first time, what if they bring in the army and the police go psycho (they blatantly ignored people breaking the rules here the first time) and can enter our homes?</p>
<p>But the reality is that the police and army can't keep that up. People in my area are openly saying that they won't follow such ridiculous things, and not being a city we can evade authorities better. Word in the street is people think it's <em>stupid</em> and an <em>overreaction to a cold</em>. Discussions about how <em>isolation is bad for our immune system, did you know? It doesn't make sense hey!</em> are happening all over. A random woman a family member met at the pub was going on about how these dreadful policies are killing the elderly through isolation in the nursing home she works in. Weeks ago her uber driver was talking about how wrong this all is, none of it makes sense. People are talking about suicides. How screwed the media is. Dumb politicians. </p>
<p>It's becoming open conversation even more so to talk about the shit we do here even with strangers.</p>
<p>Also pubs and places are secretly letting people dance as usual but no phones allowed, turn them off. 🤣</p>

        <p>The Americans I know (I know quite a lot) are supportive of these measures more than the Australians I know. Anecdotal but... I can see it being happening over there, at least in specific areas. People there have been arrested over masks according to the news. You've had some terrible lockdowns despite your guns.</p>

        <p>Depends where you live I guess.  I don’t personally know anyone one who is supporting the lockdown and I don’t see many people following the restrictions.  I see more masks then I’d like but they’re mostly under the nose masks being worn by people who think they’ll be confronted without them.   We have areas that are like Victoria and areas like where you are.  I don’t worry about the cops or military enforcing anything in my region because they know they can’t.  Too many people and too many guns.</p>

        <p>At this point we are not ever going back, at least not all of us without a massive campaign to reverse the fear.</p>
<p>Some things, like more work from home will be forever. Better sick leave policies as well so some good will come of this.</p>
<p>However, THIS is not sustainable.</p>
<p>No sports will last another year without fans in the stands.</p>
<p>We need interaction. Tourism, the economy, will not last. Civil war, starvation, etc are possible if we don't get more normal that this.</p>

        <p>The government will want to go back to normal for one reason: taxes. With reduced capacity in restaurants and amusement parks, that's less tax money that goes to the government. Sports brings in big tourism dollars, and taxes on peoples game tickets, hotels, and meals at restaurants. Right now, the government is still operating off of 2019's tax dollars, which was good, but just wait until they have to deal with 2020's lean income, they will be encouraging people to get out and pack restaurants, stadiums, amusement parks, and clubs</p>

        <p>&rt; I am convinced that, in spite of the facetious "goalposts" they toss out, this hysteria will never end, and we will never return to how things were before the pandemic. As a matter of fact, I'm sure that this had been the governments' original plan: Oh look, there's an emergency. Let's use the emergency as a pretext for permanently remaking society. But they couldn't just say that they were never going to bring everything back in the beginning, otherwise people wouldn't comply. So they sold the lockdown and new normal as temporary, and used "old normal" as a carrot on a stick to encourage compliance: "We can go back to normal in this many weeks... but only if we all behave!"</p>
<p>I've been saying this for a good, long while. </p>
<p>Even way back in March, I voiced many concerns about even doing the "two weeks to stop the spread" nonsense because I <strong>knew</strong> it would not be for two weeks, and once people allowed the government this leeway, that we would not get our freedoms back. Not easily, anyway. But people told me to "chill out", "just watch Netflix", insulted my intelligence, and so on. Some of those people have become hardcore lockdown and New Normal fanatic who crave more authoritarianism, while others are now members of LDS and NNN who feel "buyer's remorse" now. </p>
<p>But going back to your post, yes. Normal is being held hostage right now, and I think the kidnappers intend to shoot it in the head once they get their ransom. It's that simple. They don't intend of giving it back. There seems to be an agenda at play here, and even I can't pinpoint the <em>exact</em> endgame except it does seem like they are not shy about stating now that even the vaccine won't be "good enough", and we should prepare to live with masks, social distancing, appointments, limited capacities, the implosion of small businesses, etc. Whenever people call this a Marxist take-over, I find myself nodding a bit because there are a lot of aspects of this whole fiasco that feels like an infiltration, this coupled with the mass internet censorship that's been going on in recent times as well. But I couldn't tell you with 100% certainty where this is all headed. However, I am positive that this entire thing was a trap from the get-go, I don't think this was ever truly about a virus, and they are acting on malice instead of incompetence.</p>
