    <strong>Interesting fact about the "95% effectiveness" vaccine claim</strong>
    <p><p>The trial, which was done by the pharmeceutical company, had 22,000 people in the vaccine group and 22,000 in the placebo group. The claim that the vaccine has 95% effectiveness is based on this data.</p>
<p>&rt;Among 36,523 participants who had no evidence of existing or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, 8 cases of Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose were observed among vaccine recipients and 162 among placebo recipients.</p>
<p>Yes you read that right, the PCR tests were done 7 DAYS after injection and no more tests were done after that because they ran out of time. This is despite them saying it takes 2 weeks after vaccination to build up antibodies. So all we know based on this study is that the vaccine prevents a positive PCR test 7 days after injection, no info about what happens months later.</p>
<p>There's also this.</p>
<p>&rt;More BNT162b2 recipients than placebo recipients reported any adverse event (27% and 12%, respectively) or a related adverse event (21% and 5%). This distribution largely reflects the inclusion of transient reactogenicity events, which were reported as adverse events more commonly by vaccine recipients than by placebo recipients. Sixty-four vaccine recipients (0.3%) and 6 placebo recipients (&lt;0.1%) reported lymphadenopathy.</p>

        <p>A subsequent analysis, hidden away in a report by the US Food and Drug <br>
Administration, found that when Covid-like symptoms reported in those <br>
first few days were included, there were 407 cases among the vaccinated <br>
compared with only 287 in the placebo group</p>

        <p>It's at least 7 days after the injection, meaning they didn't count anyone with covid in the vaccine group as a positive case until 7 days after dose 2.</p>
