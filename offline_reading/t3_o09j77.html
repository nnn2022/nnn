    <strong>"Look, even though I am fully vaccinated, it means I am technically immune, right? Well, I still wear a mask everywhere, while you are not vaccinated and you don't want to respect any rules". This is what a vaccinated girl told me last night unironically</strong>
    <p><p>So last night I was with my friends and we went to a store to buy something to drink, the cashier refused to serve me because I wasn't wearing a mask, I said "ok, then I'm not buying shit" and left the store. The people I was with looked at me like some sort of alien after this and tried to tell me how we all should respect the laws and the rules. I answered that I am not respecting idiot laws and they said "the entire planet does this for fuck sake and you're the only one that has a problem with this". But the icing on the cake was a girl, vaccinated with both doses of Pfizer (who couldn't use her hand since the second dose that was yesterday) told me that she keeps respecting every law and rule although she is fully vaccinated. I asked her "and what does this say about you?" She didn't knew what I was talking about. She said as long as I am not vaccinated, I should respect every single rule that is and that I have no right to say anything about it. I just laughed and said "yeah, that's not me". Others told me that even if they did what I was doing, they would be kicked out from everywhere at which I responded with "yeah, because we would be in a minority, if more and more people would be doing it, they would have nothing to do anymore". And another intelligent individual said "lol, if we would all be like you, the world would go to shit".</p>
<p>There is no hope.</p></p>

        <p>Common misconception about respect, it's not a given, it's something earned, same as hatred and I hate far more people than I respect, the kind of hate that If I had the chance and in no way this could be led back to me, I'd kill them. About everyone in charge in on that list, about everyone who made "demands" On MSM, about every tiktok doctor asshole telling me to follow the science. All of them, earned my utter hatred and of some many more.</p>

        <p>Good question, philosophical to an extent. I think the question is what about the current world do I think would make this a war. The simple answer would be the peaceful protestors who do nothing but stand around, hugging, drinking coffee and playing music, beaten down by cops because they defy the lockdown, I would call that a war where it's quite clear who the aggressors are.  </p>
<p>I would say when a healthy population is forced to take an untested drug, whether trough corrupt politicians or hostile work environments is grounds for war.  </p>
<p>The taking of our freedoms bit by bit, day by day, the freedom our ancestors fought so hard for to achieve, I call even the attempt at taking that way from us, for even a reason as them saying they have our best interest in mind when the only thing they have in mind being their own wallets, I think that is war.  </p>
<p>All that is missing from this war is that at this point all of these things are merely a one sided atrocious assault, when we truly stand up, keep out back straight and push back. Then one can call it a true war, because it's not one side fighting.   </p>
<p>Or maybe you were asking about the dictionary definition of war, sorry I dont have that.</p>

        <p>Alright see the burden of nobody is easy to break. After a divorce in order to be eligible to see his children the judge ruled that the father needed to be vaccinated as the mother. That is forcing. It's not just at gunpoint it's withholding something from you until you comply.  </p>
<p>What freedoms? Right to assembly, right to free speech since now you cant criticize the WHO or fauci who were wrong at every turn. Right of bodily autonomy since they want to force everyone to take the vaccine with mandates or withholding the ability to work or travel which many people can't live without.  </p>

        <p>&rt;Right to assembly</p>
<p>This was never infringed on.</p>
<p>1) it's 2021, not 1821. Most assembly these days happens online</p>
<p>2) despite the lockdown orders (state mandates btw, not federal), we saw many groups assemble peacefully and not be broken up by law enforcement anyway. Sure, they didn't want you throwing ragers at your buddy Chad's house, but that is not what right to assembly protects </p>
<p>&rt;right to free speech since now you cant criticize the WHO or fauci</p>
<p>??? You absolutely can? You're doing it in this very post. Nobody is going to throw you in jail for criticism. However, right to free speech doesn't mean I have to accept what you're saying is truth, or that I cannot think you're wrong.</p>
<p>&rt;Right of bodily autonomy since they want to force everyone to take the vaccine with mandates or withholding the ability to work or travel which many people can't live without.</p>
<p>This isn't even true. Your work cannot legally demand to see a record of your vaccination, and I have flown countless times over the last year without having been vaccinated. Boohoo the airlines say you need to wear a mask. They also make you were pants and a shirt.</p>

        <p>This is seriously the ranting of a psychopath.</p>
<p>Let's pretend for a minute that Covid doesn't exist, is a complete fabrication.</p>
<p>You would kill people who honestly believe that wearing a mask and minimizing contact with others will help us get to the other side, as temporary measures?</p>
<p>If you're willing to kill, are you willing to die for your cause? Because it doesn't sound like it. It sounds like you just want to kill people, and will use any flimsy excuse to justify it.</p>

        <p>Im willing to tear down the entire world so something better can be born and im willing to pay for the warcrimes that would have to be committed all so the strong can live free again and never be made weak again, Im ready for war, my target isn't people too scared to leave their homes, they will avoid conflict at all cost and they will be spared, they can stay inside forever, will have food, water and power. I dont care, it will the dying breath of this dystopia, it will not impact the reckoning to come. Im not unhinged, Im just prepared to do what is needed.</p>

        <p>Why does "doing what is needed" always conclude to murder, war crimes etc.?</p>
<p>Honest question.</p>
<p>Wouldnt "doing what is needed" also include: admitting to beeing wrong, working against the virus to protect the weak and beeing mildly inconvinienced by wearing a mask ?</p>
<p>You always hear this phrase from oppressive regiemes trying to justify their actions or even terrorist groups. They dont want to kill anybody, they dont want to kill innocent people but "they have to for the greater good".</p>
<p>Wanting to kill people we disagree with is seemingly accepted if it fits your own agenda ... and thats just terribly sad.</p>

        <p>Because the way the world has been convinced being right is based on group think without critical thought into if it's effective, it's not, Lord Fauci himself said so numerous times in private and public that none of the measures, are. What would've worked and already has is the virus spreads among the healthy, they gain nigh permanent immunity and life goes on, everyone happy. Now everyone has immunity and we could go open everything and nothing would happen and practically nothing has since the death by viral infections from this and the last 2 years has been similar to the ten years before that. There is no pandemic, that is the big lie so to then force everyone to take up measures, in some cases permanent measures is an attack on the public. Most people still have that very human thing called a sense of individuality and liberty and freedom and won't take it when they are forced to comply to the herd. If the herd wants to run of a cliff I can't help but feel if I shoot the first couple 100 cows, the rest might consider turning around. If not, well they would've died anyway, what's the harm.</p>
