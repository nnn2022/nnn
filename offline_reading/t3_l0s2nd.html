    <strong>The Big Foot analogy</strong>
    <p><p>There is a national emergency, reports are coming out everywhere of mass destruction to person and property. You are called in to investigate, and identify who or what is responsible for this damage.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You start by going out and talking to any potential witnesses, who may have seen the subject, however you quickly realize that there is no direct eye witness accounts.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Each witness has only to report the causal effects seen after the fact, or at best "from the corner of my eye" reports. You are told to compile a list of descriptors based on these reports and build a test based off these observer comments.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>However due to the lack of tangible evidence you quickly find these descriptors at best are vague, and at worst are contradictory to one another. Some report "grey creature with scaly back" others "brown with long fur".</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Unfortunately this has been a highly politicized emergency, and your pressured to come up with a test that will allow authorities to identify potential culprits based on the "observers models".</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Pressure continues to build, as results are demanded. So the test criteria is compiled, and passed on to be approved.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>To your dismay, a positive test is graded when only 10% of the descriptors are matched. These tests are then standardized, and authorities quickly realize the sure depth of the emergency when they find subjects all over the country testing positive, even the neighborhood garbage truck and lamp pole behind your house.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Step 1-Observers build models based on symptoms rather than causations</p>
<p>Step 2-Models are put together to form a common theory, based on inconclusive evidence</p>
<p>Step 3-$cience</p>
<p>Result-Manufactured crisis</p></p>
