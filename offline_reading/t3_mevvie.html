        <p>If they were truly severely immunocompromised to the point that covid would be an actual danger to them...then they would have already been taking precautions long before this...because there are literally thousands of types of pathogens that would have also been dangerous for them... including ones that live in the vast majority of human beings and ones we encounter every single day of life, everywhere, whether it be our phone screens, kitchen tables, or door handles. All of a sudden a bunch these clowns claim they are "immunocompromised" when they sure weren't worried about any virus or bacteria back in February. So much bullshit with this whole mass pandemic of mass psychosis.</p>

        <p>It annoys me that they don’t care how many people will die from lockdowns. Hundreds of millions of impoverished people will starve according to the UN’s own numbers, not to mention the deaths from suicides, drug and alcohol abuse, and violence.  The very SCIENCE institutions they trust admit that the lockdowns are statistically more deadly than the virus itself.  And... crickets.  Until they go back to their vomit like the dogs they are and accuse all dissenters of “murder for the rotten freedom to go to Applebee’s”.</p>

        <p>This is an interesting point. But I’m hung up on the statement that “the lockdowns are statistically more deadly than the virus itself”. You can’t compare the amount of deaths by starvation this year to COVID-19 deaths because the amount of COVID-19 deaths has surely been mitigated by the lockdown, no?</p>

        <p>No, I don’t believe the lockdowns were effective in mitigating deaths, because Sweden was not locked down like other countries.  They carried on as normal since March last year, and they didn’t have a higher death rate than years before.</p>
<p>The deaths by starvation, suicide, domestic violence, drug and alcohol abuse, etc, caused directly by the lockdowns, are mostly affecting children, young people, and the poorest of the poor.  The people we are trying (and failing to) protect from Covid are overwhelmingly people well above the average life expectancy who will die of something else within the next five years, who are middle class or above by first world standards.</p>
<p>It is extremely backwards to collectively sacrifice the lives of infants, youth, and impoverished just to give elderly, wealthier people a few more years to live.  To condemn third worlders to starve to death to protect obese first worlders.</p>
<p>And the irony is, Sweden proves that the lockdowns are not effective at all. It is all a pretense for mass surveillance and totalitarianism.</p>

        <p>Surely you recognize that comparing countries like Sweden and, for instance, the USA is not very logical though—a population of 10 million in Sweden and a population denisty 1/4 that of the lower 48. Do you think the USA would have had the same amount of deaths had we not had a lockdown?</p>
<p>I would argue that the COVID deaths we have seen have also disproportionately affected the “poorest of the poor”. And no, thousands of people in their 50s and 60s who realistically have 20 or 30 years left have died from COVID.</p>

        <p>Shockingly, everything is not always about the USA.  Compare Sweden to a comparable country that had strict lockdowns, and you will not see any significant difference in deaths.</p>
<p>I highly doubt “thousands” of Americans who died of covid in their 50s and 60s had so many decades longer to live. The death numbers are almost entirely made up of extremely old people and obese middle-aged people, and the obese do not usually live past their 60s.</p>
<p>The fact is, as I said, practically all of covid deaths are people well above the average life expectancy or obese people.  We are sacrificing the lives of innocent children and third world people, to starvation, suicide, violence, and medical negligence, all to save old people and middle aged people in the first world who were too irresponsible to put down the McDonalds.</p>
<p>You can bring up some rare outlier covid deaths of younger, seemingly healthy people, but the exception proves the rule.</p>

        <p>Alright, I’ll bite. Finland and Norway, neighbors of Sweden and political analogs, have had 5x fewer population-adjusted deaths than sweden. FIVE TIMES.

<p>65 is not “extremely old”. You are living in the past if you think a 65 year old will “surely die within the next five years anyway.” What a disgusting generalization. </p>
<p>What about Italy, widely regarded as one of the healthier countries in the world? Remember them? Over 100k deaths and I’d imagine not too many of them are eating McDonalds. </p>
<p>Also I would love an answer to my question. Do you think we would have the same amount of COVID deaths in the USA had we not locked down?</p>
<p>Also bruh the lockdowns are not worldwide. You saying that lockdowns have “served only to benefit people in the first world” is ludicrous because all third world countries have control over their own COVID situation. Locking down in the USA has no bearing on what happens elsewhere.</p>

        <p>The vast majority of covid deaths aren't 65 year olds. The average age of a "covid death" is the age of life expectancy in the West (80+).</p>
<p>The idea that covid is anything remotely like a death sentence for everyone who is elderly is completely false. It is also a complete misunderstanding of the nature of this virus and the facts of how elderly people, who have reached the end of their natural lifespan die. </p>
<p>You need to understand that the vast majority of elderly people will be completely okay (94% of those over 80 will not die if they contract covid). Many will not even have symptoms at all. Covid only skews a higher mortality rate for the elderly because many old people are far more likely to have severe late-stage health conditions and weakened immune systems as a result of the aging process. Also, there is the fact that people who aren't really old have been brainwashed to be irrationally afraid of this virus. Those in their 60s, for example, have no greater risk of death from covid than they do of annual flu. But the way society acts, is as if covid is a death sentence or a month long hospital stay on a ventilator for anyone over 60. This is absurd. A 65 year-old with a severe illness like cancer might die, as their immune system having to fight covid will simply be the last straw on their already frail body. But the average person in their 60s or 70s will not, most won't have anything more than mild or moderate symptoms.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately I can’t do this anymore, but one of your figures is false. Over 20% of people who have died from COVID have been under 65 in the USA. Thats over 100k people. The CDC estimates that between 12-60k deaths are seen annually from the flu. so not only is that between 2-8x more, thats TOTAL deaths from the flu, not just people under 65. So yeah. Way more deadly.</p>

        <p>Does that matter? Are you saying that the CDC’s high end estimate is too low? there’s some uncertainty but surely you don’t know more than the CDC about calculating flu deaths?</p>

        <p>It does matter, because the number of "covid deaths" is therefore highly inflated as they're counting every case and listing very frail and elderly people with several comorbidities as having died from a respiratory virus. </p>
<p>Imagine if prior to March 2020 they had done mass testing for the flu. Your only symptoms are a scratchy throat and a few sniffles? Come get a test! Don't have a single symptom at all? Come get a test! You think they wouldn't be able to find a 100,000 cases in the US every single day if they did that? Hell, they would probably find 200-300k cases a day if they did. Testing for covid is like testing for a cold or flu virus...except they are treating it as if it were ebola, and each case had a 50% chance of dying. It's absolutely the most bizarre thing in modern history. </p>
<p>This is why you couldn't get tested for the flu, unless you had severe enough symptoms to be hospitalized. Imagine such a dumb joke as "please give me a test, I think I might have the flu! " What are your symptoms?" "Well...I don't have any." They are doing the complete opposite with covid, they want everyone to get tested all the time. It's beyond idiotic and insane.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the CDC (and NIAID) are private organizations that can easily be swayed by the agendas of those who have the resources to lobby effectively.</p>

        <p>Dude, if you come to a hospital because you are having respiratory distress, you are admitted, given a covid test, and you test positive, and then subsequently die because of your symptoms, you died of covid. it doesn’t matter what these comorbidities are... would these people have died if they hadn’t contracted the virus? no, they wouldn’t have. </p>
<p>I’m sorry but this proves my point. Hundreds of thousands of cases of the flu unrecorded—-&rt;same amount of deaths—-&rt;covid is way deadlier than the flu. </p>
<p>Private organizations can be swayed, but it doesn’t mean they are. Not everything is a conspiracy.</p>

        <p>They would have died sooner or later. If a 93 year-old didn't contract covid she would have two more months of nursing home life before she dies of one of her five comorbidities. </p>
<p>It was generally understood prior to March of 2020 that a common cause of death for elderly people is respiratory illness (go look up the CDC's stats from previous years on pneumonia deaths...a very common cause of death for the elderly). No one, whether medical professional/epidemiologist or typical reddit/social media moron thought there was anything abnormal about an octogenarian with multiple comorbidities dying from a respiratory illness less than a year ago. For some bizarre reason, they have all collectively forgotten. </p>
<p>CDC has destroyed it's own credibility with how they chose to handle this. They went from rational and scientific a little more than a year ago year, to a psychotic break. CDC sure understood what IFR meant last year...now they act like they don't anymore. And you still don't believe that there could possibly be anything nefarious going on here.</p>

        <p>The problem is that you are treating covid deaths as if they are more sacred than all deaths.  Here is <a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20201116/Study-compares-deaths-in-Sweden-and-Norway-before-and-after-COVID-pandemic.aspx">another study</a> about Sweden and Norway:</p>
<p>&rt; "Our study shows that although Covid-19 associated mortality rate was almost 15-fold higher in Sweden than in Norway during the epidemic, all-cause mortality was not higher in Sweden compared with three of the four preceding years", say study researchers.</p>
<p>Swedes aren’t dying at a rate any higher than the previous four years. So why prioritize the deaths of older and fatter people, by punishing everyone and especially children and the poor?</p>
<p>Child suicide rates are at an unprecedented high from the social isolation.  We are also ruining these children’s immune systems and social development for the rest of their lives, because we value giving a fat 60 year old fuck a couple more decades to live, because a covid death is more important and sacred than any other death of any other cause.</p>

        <p>Also I would argue that Covid is more deadly to obese first worlders than “the poorest of the poor”.</p>
<p>Indonesia, for example, has a population of about 268 million. They’re almost as numerous as Americans.  Out of 268 million, they have only experienced 40,000 covid deaths in the past year, because they aren’t fattened by wealth like America and Europe are. Barely any of them are obese.  But their poor will die from the global economic consequences of lockdowns.</p>
<p>That is just one example.</p>
<p>It’s weird how people can decry the exploitation of the third world, and the selfishness of first world white nations, except when it comes to Covid, suddenly it’s ok to sacrifice the poor to save the rich, and you can come up with a thousand excuses for it.</p>
