    <strong>CDC finally admits that the Pandemic was indeed a Hoax</strong>
    <p><p>But more and more non-vaccinated people would also show similar symptoms  after close contact with vaccinated people, the doctor points out. Dr  Palevsky addresses the phenomenon of "shedding" mentioned earlier. He,  too, believes that it is possible for vaccinated people to transfer  their spike proteins to unvaccinated people and that these can also  cause fatal side effects in them: "We should be alarmed when we perceive  that people who have surrounded themselves with vaccinated people  suffer typical covid symptoms and, in addition, miscarriages, heavy  bleeding, disturbances of the menstrual cycle also occur." He strongly  advises staying away from the "vaccinated sheep". </p>
