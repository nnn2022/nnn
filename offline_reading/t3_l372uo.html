    <strong>Fearmongering about new strain in Brazil</strong>
    <p><p>For some weeks there has been many coverage in the media about the situation in Manaus (capital of the State of Amazonas), and not just on Brazil, allegedly, Manaus's oxygen supply is running low, and many people are dying, there are several videos coming out from Manaus of people crying and telling how desperate the situation is, etc.</p>
<p>Perhaps coincidentally, Manaus was the scene of a succesful anti-lockdown protest back in December, doomers here in Brazil are now using this to support lockdowns of course.</p>
<p>But the most interesting part is, that the growth of cases in Manaus is actually caused by a new strain, according to the "experts", it is not known if it can affect the efficacy of the vaccines, however they are claiming that the strain can evade antibodies and reinfect people:</p>
<p>https://noticias.uol.com.br/saude/ultimas-noticias/redacao/2021/01/18/mulher-foi-reinfectada-por-tipo-de-coronavirus-no-am-mesmo-com-anticorpos.htm</p>
<p>(Article in Portuguese)</p>
<p>And they are now claiming that the strain is both more contagious, more dangerous, and more lethal as well:</p>
<p>https://noticias.uol.com.br/saude/ultimas-noticias/redacao/2021/01/19/mais-rapida-grave-e-letal-entre-jovens-medicos-relatam-nova-covid-no-am.htm</p>
<p>Now I don't know exactly what the situation in Manaus is like, since I don't live there, maybe the situation is indeed as terrible as the media is claiming, maybe it's not, perhaps some Brazilian user who lives there can talk more about this here, but as an outside observer all I can say is that it looks eerily similar to the propaganda about Wuhan last year.</p>
<p>Remember when those videos were "leaking" out of Wuhan, showing people falling and convulsing out of nowhere, hospitals filled, etc? On hindsight it's pretty obvious those videos were either faked or taken out of context, but those videos, along with the media saying the virus was just a flu (which it indeed was), helped many people buy the hysteria at first, I'm afraid they are trying to pull a similar stunt in order to justify putting us under house arrest another year and the Brazilian strain is maybe the new strain they picked to do that.</p>
<p>I'm just creating this thread to help alert people on this sub and other anti-lockdown subs about this possibility.</p></p>

        <p>Not a Brazilian user, but fuck they won’t let this end. Lol. As soon as some “good” news comes out “the vaccines are out and being distributed!” We get more bad news, too. Why? Because they don’t want this shit to end. A virus CANNOT mutate to become MORE deadly. A virus doesn’t SPREAD when it is constantly killing its host. The whole goal of a virus is to spread. So therefore, it always mutates to become less lethal over time. More fear mongering, propaganda bullshit.
To keep us Locked away.</p>

        <p>Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't the Spanish Flu mutate and became much deadlier and that's why the second wave was so bad?</p>

        <p>In fact, the Spanish Flu mutated to become more benign over time.  This is the #1 example of a virus mutating into something more ubiquitous within the population, and therefore more benign.  </p>
<p>Most experts agree modern day Influenza A is what was formally the Spanish Flu.</p>
<p>The deadly second wave of the Spanish Flu was due to a combination of factors, one being a bacterial infection.  One can contract a virus and defeat it, however some of the RNA remnants of the virus remain in the system and induce a bacterial response sometimes called septic shock.  </p>
<p>The way this works is the infection of Spanish Flu generates an inflammatory immune response, which would lead to pneumonia.  The patient would then recover from the pneumonia, and would feel better for a few days.  However, the inflammation and toxicity left behind by the virus would create a bacterial infection which ultimately ended up killing a lot of people.  </p>
<p>So while the virus was becoming more ubiquitous and benign, more people were dying due to septic shock.  </p>
<p>That sounds like the same thing, but it isn't.  Over time, the virus would become more accustomed with our epigenome, and fewer of these cytokine driven inflammatory responses leading to bacterial infection occurred.</p>
<p>What will happen with covid, is eventually it will reach homeostasis.  It will become ubiquitous with the human epigenome, similar to influenza A, and will simply be a mild seasonal illness, like the flu.</p>

        <p>Makes sense. I knew that it eventually mutated into the seasonal flu but I always heard that it became deadlier in the second wave due to mutating. Probably dumb mainstrean media articles.</p>

        <p>Some people have said that.  I've also heard, "well, we don't know which direction it will mutate!"</p>
<p>But this is just base fear mongering.  Generally speaking, viruses become less dangerous the more ubiquitous they become.</p>

        <p>Tl;dr - Generally the more a virus mutates in nature, the more ubiquitous and benign it becomes.  Especially for respiratory illnesses like covid.</p>

        <p>If you're following this you will know that local government re instituted taxes on oxygen tanks in december, making them go from BRL1000 to BRL 1600.</p>
<p>This is government made. </p>
<p>Also logistics is extremely hard for Manaus. It takes 5 days by boat for new oxygen tanks to arrive. </p>
<p>Also Manaus is CONSTANTLY living through public health crisis. Their health system is constantly overloaded. Just search for this any time in the last few decades.</p>

<p>People keep forgetting that it was like this all over Brazil, and it's been since way before the "pandemic"</p>
<p>Yet somehow, manaus's government shut down most of the emergency facilities that had been built to accomodate covid pacients last year. This is all BS</p>
