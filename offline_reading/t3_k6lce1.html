    <strong>Freedom as a numbers game...</strong>
    <p><p>Looking at the latest doom and gloom numbers from our purveyors of The Great Covid Panic, I had this thought last night:</p>
<p>Number of dead Canadians it took to defend our freedom in WWI: <em>61,00</em>0.</p>
<p>Number of dead Canadians it took to defend our freedom in WWII: <em>45,400</em>.</p>
<p>Number of dead Canadians it took to surrender our freedoms during Covid: <em>12,407</em>.</p>
<p>Uncle Adolf and Kaiser Bill must be laughing at us from Hell. What four to six years of slaughter, hardship, and suffering borne by an entire citizenry couldn't accomplish, a virus and a propaganda campaign has done in eight months.</p>
<p>Now imagine the figures for the UK and France...</p></p>

        <p>What confuses me is that almost every military guy I know is all into the covid hysteria and support more restrictions. You'd think they'd have better grasp of relative risks... </p>
<p>Maybe they are just hoping to get an excuse to exercise violence on the people. Or maybe the military training has wiped out all of their ability to question authority figures, if they had any to begin with. Or perhaps they just want something to be excited about (the only action the armed forces of my country get is to patrol countries that the US has bombed to submission and to fight forest fires).</p>

        <p>The funny thing is with the guys I know, It's the older (30+) ones that either disbelieved the narrative from the get-go, or gradually came to realize that it was false.</p>
<p>It's the youngest guys that wear masks everywhere and seem to be terrified, even when you tell them "You don't have to wear a fucking face diaper around me if you don't want to." </p>
<p>And yes, the army guys are being fed lies, from their own medical branch. Lies like "False positive PCR tests are close to a statistical zero"' when a 30 second Google search will tell you that isn't true.</p>

        <p>They probably aren't allowed to see what's really going on.  They're kept on base and not allowed out and then fed a constant stream of hysteria.  They may not know that everyone is still alive.</p>

        <p>I mean I’m not at all comfortable with the analogy. Soldiers who die in war are young, healthy and in the prime of their lives. People who die of covid well, aren’t. </p>
<p>But total deaths attributed to WWI: 15-22 million (1.2% of the world population).</p>
<p>Total deaths attributed to WW2: 70-85 million (3% of the world population). </p>
<p>Deaths attributed to Covid 19: 1.5 million (0.0019 percent of the world population).</p>

        <p>1918 &amp; 1945 : Young men were willing to run straight into a hail of bullets, knowing very well that many of their comrades would not survive</p>
<p>2020 : Young men are afraid of a virus with a survival rate of &rt;99.97%</p>
