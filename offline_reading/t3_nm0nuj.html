<p>died within 60 days of the first specimen date</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>died more than 60 days after the first specimen date with COVID-19 mentioned on the death certificate"  </p>
<p>"Taking the COVID-19 cases that are referred to the Michigan Disease Surveillance System and comparing the entire list for the past 30 days to the vital records data to see if any cases in the system have died in the past 30 days from natural causes. An accidental death or an accident wouldn’t be ruled out, but natural causes that are recorded on a death certificate for a confirmed case of COVID-19 within 30 days and the onset of symptoms would count as a COVID-19 associated death, state officials said.</p>

<p>Imagine if the government counted any death within 30 days of marijuana use to be a marijuana death? How many millions would marijuana have killed by now? Clearly none, but the data would say millions! Why would they use that methodology when you will get horribly inaccurate results? They are manipulating data.  </p>
<p>I also find it peculiar that in 2016, preventable medical errors were the 3rd leading cause of death in the US, but they just stopped happening in 2020? <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/study_suggests_medical_errors_now_third_leading_cause_of_death_in_the_us">https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/study_suggests_medical_errors_now_third_leading_cause_of_death_in_the_us</a>  </p>

        <p>So what's the point of arguing? No one believes anyone anyways so what's the point? The only people I know who have gotten sick are my parents way back in the beginning in this shit when everyone was following the rules. I hadn't seen them in a couple months at that point. They felt sick for sure but nothing crazy, they got lucky I guess. It's been a year and a bit of lock downs. I'm done with this shit.</p>

        <p>Oh so people you know have gotten sick. How many more people do you think you spread that to without even knowing. This is what I mean when I say I'm not going to bother arguing. I agree that lockdowns are not necessary especially at this point and that some response to this pandemic has been unsupported. However, that doesn't absolve this sub from the damage it's done. Spreading misleading information about the vaccine and virus, the selective bias of presenting vaccine related deaths rather than Covid deaths, and people just straight up saying that vulnerable people deserve to die is why this sub has no ethics. I think everyone that took part in this should take a long look at their principles.</p>

        <p>Welln it's pretty obvious to me that covid deaths have been massively skewed. I know people that have died during the pandemic, not from covid, and their deaths were labeled as covid deaths. Now with the vaccines out they are skewing the other way! Oh don't worry that death had nothing to do with the vaccine it's fine. Seems like something is going on here. The government needs to be more clear because they are the ones causing this panic.</p>

        <p>Yup all 3.5 million deaths are just reporting errors. Even if a vast majority were reporting errors vaccine related deaths still would be negligible. But again what is the point of me bringing this up. You'll just ignore this and continue to be a participant in denying and worsening the largest cause of mass deaths in recent history.</p>

        <p>Well I tried dude. I never said all deaths were reporting errors. But there are lots of recorded deaths from covid that had nothing to do with it. Why risk my body with an injection that might go poorly when I can have a 99.97% of living without doing anything?</p>

        <p>I don't know maybe because the world isn't just about you and your chances of survival. Did you think maybe their are long term effects of covid that may affect your parents? Did you ever think that you have a social duty to be personally responsible, and think about the moral implications of your actions.</p>

        <p>Well what are the long them affects of the vaccine? Who knows that will do to my body in 5 years. If you don't feel safe going outside, don't go outside. Why punish everyone? Why not let the people who are at risk stay home and the people who aren't at risk can go live their lives?</p>

        <p>Hmmm I'm not the one denying the largest cause of mass death in recent history. I'm also not denying people have died due to complications from the vaccine. It's because I don't have selective bias toward one or the other (like any average human being with critical thinking skills) that I'm able to evaluate that the vaccine provides a utilitarian benefit to society. I'm glad your wife is happy and healthy, but you didn't do your part to make it that way. This sub spreads too much misinformation that any participant has actively harmed our ability to get back to normal and prevent unnecessary deaths.</p>

        <p>If the vaccine doesn’t fully protect you or those around  you, and can even harm you, how are people
In this sub harming your ability to get back to normal? If 99% of young people have minor symptoms and then developed immunity for life, why should they need to be vaccinated to return to normal? Do you still believe in the 2 weeks to flatten the curve thing or what? If you want the shot, by all means get it. But to force the entire population to do it “or else we can’t return to normal” is laughable and disgusting. If all the information was transparent and there wasn’t obvious deception on top of ridiculous incentives like donuts, lottery tickets, gift cards. I’m sure we’d all line up to get it no problem. But if you’re going to ignore all the cons and fallacies with the vaccine in hopes of “trying to get back to normal” then YOU are the ignorant one.</p>

        <p>I shouldn't need to respond. It's so full of holes that if you have two brain cells to rub together you should be able to see the mental gymnastics. It is a waste of time arguing if we can't even agree on a common set of facts, and no matter what I say you will either ignore it or bring up some other wildly unsupported claim. I hope one day you come to the realization of what you are really saying here, and what this sub really stands for : lack of personal responsibility, cognitive dissonance, and complete moral failing.</p>

        <p>You don't <strong>need</strong> to respond, no one is forcing you obviously. The <strong>reason</strong> I'm asking is that I was interested in what you had to say. Many people have accused local, state, and the federal governments in the USA and abroad, of bloating statistics - including car accident deaths, cancer, heart disease and strokes in the COVID death statistics. I've seen videos of supposed healthcare professionals giving their testimonials, people on the internet citing rising statistics in COVID-19 deaths, and the numbers from other sources of "natural" death falling in conjunction with COVID-19's rising statistics.   </p>
<p>I've BEEN social distancing, I've BEEN wearing my mask, washing my hands regularly, sanitizing etc.  I shut down my office and we're now working from home. We're having a <strong>discussion</strong>. This is a place to <strong>discuss</strong> and <strong>debate</strong>. Having a discussion doesn't mean we haven't been following the guidelines set by our respective governments. The same people that "insist" you vaccinate didn't promote or even practice living a healthy lifestyle: regular exercise, vitamins, minerals, and prohormones.  These things were never mentioned in the daily press briefings or discussed by those most vocal about "taking precautions". I've been doing all these things, even before the "pandemic". 90% of people just sat around on their lazy asses and gained 10-20 lbs of fat saying, " Trust the science, wait for the vaccine, how can you worry about your long-term financial health when people are dying!" .   </p>
<p>I<strong>njecting myself with some rushed vaccine, where the developing company is granted blanket immunity, is where I draw the fucking line.</strong> I don't work and sweat my ass of 2-3 hours a day to kowtow to a bunch of fat, lazy smooth brains that can't be bothered to be a proper steward over their OWN health, let alone MY health.   </p>
<p>When people take the time to cite sources for their data and all you say is, " 3.5 million people died.... you just care about whatever is convenient for you " - I'd argue that <strong>YOU</strong> don't care enough about those "3.5 million" people to respond intelligently.</p>

        <p>Oh yeah a real great place for debate where if you even mention that people die from covid you get downvoted, but everyone cheers unsupported and misleading anecdotes about the vaccine. That response is so ridiculous that it shows me that this sub's misinformation and ignorance has permeated completely into each member of this echo chamber. It's even hard to believe that you can't see any issues with it, and I suspect that you don't want to. It is more convenient to complain and be ignorant than evaluate your choices. Have fun in your echo chamber, and live your life in a world not based in reality. Goodbye.</p>

<p>Maybe it's because we've heard that same narrative since 02/01/2020 - you're not contributing anything new by regurgitating that tired narrative. Either provide counterpoints or new information. "Halfchubbub" tells me all I need to know about your mental and emotional maturity.  </p>
<p>Edit: Yeah, post history is pretty much all about video games. Just another brainwashed, lazy shill.</p>

        <p>But I'm sure that's how they start the report for the ratings, but then within the reporting they turn it around that xyz doc says vax is safe, then they show some CDC statement followed by vax manufacturer trial data showing it's safe and that it was all just bad timing cause people die all the time.</p>

        <p>And the NWO knows this. The next phase of their "plandemic" is to not only instill fear, but to start a massive PR campaign where those who've been vaxxed or those who are in authority will start going after those of us who haven't been vaxxed. </p>
<p>And then once that part of their plan fails, then comes the incarcerations, the forceful confinements, and the possible forced injections, for those of us left who haven't taken it. </p>
<p>I suspect that the NWO is on an extremely tight deadline, and no matter what, they have to complete their goals by the end of this year or by early next year. </p>

        <p>I like to stay consistent with my thinking.</p>
<p>If I’m not gonna sweat over a 99.97% survival rate of covid, I’m definitely not gonna sweat over a 99.97% survival rate of the vaccine.</p>
<p>That’s why im confused so many people here post the vaccine deaths etc.... It’s so minimal, you’re better off wasting your energy from bad doctor handwriting and prescription deaths</p>

<p>you're not guaranteed to have a "case" or "infection" of COVID... ever</p>
<p>you are guaranteed to have a covid injection if you get injected</p>
<p>so for the numbers you proposed, the "danger" for COVID would be much less for the covid injection</p>
