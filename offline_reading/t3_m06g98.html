    <strong>Now that America at least, seems to be starting to open back up- are you being more conscious about where you spend money??</strong>
    <p><p>I need to think long and hard about if I will renew my costco membership- I have a large family but I dont think I can costo ever again, amazon seems to be a fine replacement.  I can even tolerate walmart in a pinch.</p>
<p>I am having a difficult time even considering going back to barnes and noble, while they have been open they have a 'zero exceptions' to masks; havent been there since the dang sign went up.</p>
<p>One particular Target in my area has the gustapo at the door screaming about 'MASKS ARE REQUIRED IN OUR STORE' when there are very clear exceptions in the mandate. the gatekeeper keeps yelling as we walk by.  No other target does this, unfortunately our rx's are at this target and it would be a pain to move them all.  BUT I no longer shop at this target.</p>
<p>No more Panera, again 'zero exceptions' to the mask when you are ordering or entering the store.  Never mind the entire dining room is full of unmasked people eating, talking, sitting all day using the place as an office.</p>
<p>Locally owned restaurants never gave an issue about no masks and were always happy to serve our large family (more than 6 at a table), we will continue to visit those places.</p>
<p>I'm sure there are other places I've been avoiding or dont even miss at this point.  Funny how something so critical and important, just really isnt.</p></p>

        <p>I will not fly on Southwest Airlines. Now that federal law requires airlines to allow medical mask exemptions but didn't give any guidance, Southwest now has an extremely abusive mask exemption policy. Only one person per flight (so no two family members can have a mask exemption and fly together). The flight must be at least 50% empty. If it fills to 51% capacity at the last minute, the person with a medical mask exemption cannot get on the plane. Even though they got the required doctor's note. Even though they talked to a Southwest doctor on the phone. Even though they got the required negative Covid test within 72 hours. I don't usually use bad words, but fuck Southwest.</p>
<p>And I don't have a medical exemption for masks. I am boycotting Southwest because they have revealed themselves to be assholes.</p>

        <p>I cant even stomach the thought of flying- havent flown in almost a decade and have no desire to ever fly again.  I would love to travel but unless I find some private pilot and private jet its not happening..</p>

        <p>Well.. I try to buy ammo and prepping goods from small business. But Kroger has touchless shopping. I pull up. Pop my trunk. They load it. Amazon supplies the rest. That way I don’t have to being around the public much.</p>

        <p>I am definitely aware of shopping local. Especially sensitive bec my own businesses have have suffered, so I understand the struggle. </p>
<p>I am also willing to drive out of my way to businesses that don’t require masks.</p>

        <p>I really try to stick to private business’s. Meats and produce I can get at local farms. Supplements i have a good spot I’ve been going to for years. My gym doesn’t require a mask. These are perfect times to be low maintenance. If I need a gift I’ll do a little research and look for private small business. I really believe nows the time we have to try to help each other. I’ll pay whatever extra it cost. Small business’s can’t go away</p>
