<title>One year since Canada’s “patient zero” arrived back home. This person remains anonymous while people today are shamed in public and online as “grandma killers.” The first case clearly killed ALL the grandmothers, why aren’t the Sooners DOXING this dude?</title>

    <strong>One year since Canada’s “patient zero” arrived back home. This person remains anonymous while people today are shamed in public and online as “grandma killers.” The first case clearly killed ALL the grandmothers, why aren’t the Sooners DOXING this dude?</strong>
    <p><p>At the time, we shall be reminded by Dr. Theresa Tam (Canada’s top doctor) that “the risk of an outbreak in Canada <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/it-wasn-t-called-covid-at-the-time-one-year-since-canada-s-first-covid-19-case-1.5279999">remains low.”</a></p>
<p>We shall remember Nancy Pelosi was parading around Chinatown on February 24, 2020 essentially calling those living in fear racists saying herself that <a href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/nancy-pelosi-visits-san-franciscos-chinatown/2240247/">“everything is fine here.”</a></p>
<p>We shall remember Anthony Fauci’s initial position on masks, and how he later changed his view on the subject. He and his hospital cronies lied to America about the need to mask up because they <a href="https://youtu.be/Cq8iQ65p9B0">“were afraid that would deter away from the people that really needed it.”</a> (start video at 2:30 - posted by Jimmy Dore, Outspoken media critic and left-leaning YouTube personality also happens to be fighting for hashtag forcethevote in support of Medicare for all - in case anyone wants to call this guy a conspiratorial/alt-right actor)</p>
<p>We shall remember the “14 days to flatten the curve.”</p>
<p>We shall remember we are now living in a world demanding that we snuff out a microbe completely - living in fear, snuffing out small businesses while giving large corporations the keys to the city, and closing off any contact with friends and family, while allowing BLM protests to burn cities down and to further exacerbate polarization and violence. We are also allowing the government to vaccinate people without full completion of any medical trials. And somehow people are so brainwashed that they will line up for a vaccine that does not prevent transmission, still requires you to mask up and socially distance, and does not allow you to sue a manufacturer when shit hits the fan. Ironically new strains began to appear just as vaccines became ready to the public. I find it cute that it was not okay to initially ban travel from China for fear of being viewed as “racist” all while today no one is allowed in or out of the UK - not racist against a predominantly white population. </p>
<p>Jimmy Dore again <a href="https://youtu.be/uENyOGnUH8c">now discussing Fauci’s lies to the public about “herd immunity.”</a></p>
<p>We shall also never forget that either our politicians and global leaders all got really lazy and “borrowed”/plagiarized one another’s speeches, or they are all working TOGETHER to <a href="https://youtu.be/YkcaeaD45MY">“Build Back Better.”</a> </p>
<p>We shall never forget Klaus Schwab from the World Economic Forum. He and his cronies are pushing agenda 2030 - where you will “own nothing and you’ll be happy.” Here is <a href="https://youtu.be/LhetP9yL8jE">Tim Pool discussing deletion of said WEF video.</a></p>
<p>I can go on, but I’m going to leave this post as mostly links and content. I don’t like the narrative that has shifted, and shifted so quickly. We all forget how this started, and remind those that shame you in the street for ATTEMPTING to live a normal life, that this all started with a “patient zero” that had been kept anonymous by our governments. It isn’t “patient zero” that killed all our grandmothers, it is YOUR inability to comply with the new world order. Have a wonderful Monday!</p></p>
