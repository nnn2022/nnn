    <strong>COVID weddings sub/ proof of vaccination for attendance 🤡🌎</strong>
    <p><p>Proof of Vaccination for Guests?</p>
<p>I am getting married this coming September. I know things might die down by them (fingers crossed), and by that point, the vaccine will hopefully be available to the general public. My FH and I are very much pro-vaccination, especially with something of such a high magnitude. I would say about 90% of our guestlist will be getting the vaccine as soon as possible, but both my FH and I have family members outside of our immediate families that are serious anti-vaxxers. </p>
<p>Now that many institutions and airlines will be starting to require a proof of vaccination to fly or otherwise, I'm wondering if anyone is considering doing this for their weddings or other private events. It could easily be added to RSVP cards or websites, much like many other businesses are currently doing with their basic preventative questions. </p>
<p>Would it be crazy to include "will you be able to provide proof of vaccination prior to the event?". Of course if it's not available to the general public yet that's a different story, but if the predictions are right, and it will be available by mid summer, by September no one would have any excuse not to have gotten it, other than those who simply don't want to. I understand that those who have been vaccinated should be immune, but since this is all so new, I don't think it would be crazy to ask that of guests out of respect and precaution for those guests who are older or immunocompromised.</p></p>

        <p>Its truly disturbing the lengths people are going with this. The vaccine doesn't even stop transmission, so by September a vaccinated person is going to be the same as an unvaccinated person. The only vaccination that matters is the individual- if im vaccinated then i might not be affected as badly as the unvaccinated. </p>
<p>People are prepared to throw relationships away for absolutely nothing.</p>

        <p>I’m seriously frightened, just look at the mob attacking people willingly in grocery stores for not wearing masks. (At least where I’m at on the west coast USA) no government intervention needed, fellow citizens will dox and shame you. My family called me a conspiracy theorist months ago for talking about vaccine passports, well here we go. Again, no government enforcement needed. Society will push you out willingly. Sickening.</p>

        <p>I'd politely decline the invitation. By September, all those who want to be vaccinated should be vaccinated. Anyone still pushing masks at that point are not going to be people id want to continue being friends with.</p>

        <p>I think it's pretty questionable to require a rushed out vaccine whose full long term effects aren't potentially known just to go to a wedding. It is true that couples have the right to set the standard of what they'll allow at their wedding. But it shouldn't include vaccines.</p>

        <p>I went to a wedding in September of 2020. Over 100 people I believe. Many were wearing masks, some weren't but by the time the reception rolled around, a lot of people were on the dance floor sweating and dancing within close proximity sans masks. I know of NO ONE who got sick and definitely nobody died. All that was asked of guests was to wear masks (that annoyed me and I was apprehensive of going, but I understood) and they had some there for guests too, but people were hugging and having a grand ole time. THERE WAS EVEN A COUPLE WITH A BABY THERE ALLOWING PEOPLE TO BE CLOSE TO HIM.</p>
<p>Screw this person and their irrational fear. They can do what they want, but I wouldn't attend the wedding. I've yet to see a real reason for these ridiculous measures to be taking place. I'm sure the new couple will keep their future kids (God bless them) in actual bubbles.</p>
<p>If it were my wedding, I'd go the opposite route and say that people can get vaxxed and wear masks if they want, but I won't be requiring them as I want to SEE everyone's faces. Stay home if you're a germaphobe, no measures will be in place.</p>

        <p>I'm so confused. Their whole response is about hospital control (even though we know once the virus is endemic lockdowns do not work at all). Since 99% of those in hospital are old or obese, why do we need to care about this once those people take the vaccine? Can someone provide me an example of when a virus has mutated to evade a vaccine in the past? I fucking hate the world. </p>
<p>Since March I have been saying that common sense will always prevail but it is getting worse and worse. Why on Earth would commercial airlines get involved in this vaccine passport nonsense, that would surely put an end to aviation ever reaching what it once was? Fuck this world.</p>

        <p>Funniest thing is before this COVID crap hit my wife and I planned on having the official ceremony just her, I, and the preacher, and broadcast it on a webcam.  That way anybody that wants to watch can.  That way we can do exactly what we want without having to listen to friends and family say 'ohhh this would be nice to do' and getting butt hurt when I say 'ya well we're not doing it that way'.  Or MIL trying to take over and run the show and me having to tell her to sit down and shut up.  The day is about me and my wife not friends and relatives.</p>

        <p>On a practical point, if you expect 90% of people to be vaccinated, virtually no one is in danger of getting sick. What’s the point in excluding that 10%? You’re just going to piss a bunch of people off. </p>
<p>To me, this gesture says “I love you, but not that much that I’m willing to risk you spreading your diseases around at my wedding.”</p>

        <p>I think it’s worse than that. I think most of these people are just virtue signaling how superior they are for caring more than the dirty unvaccinated.</p>

        <p>I'm currently <em>trying</em> to get engaged to my current girlfriend who wants to "celebrate" her engagement outside of a pandemic. And she wants me to get to know her parents more. Her parents haven't come out of their high rise apartment, with the exception of about six times, since April of last year. They refuse to enter anyone's home. They refuse to have anyone outside of their home enter their home. So...how am I supposed to get to know them if they won't meet? Hmm..</p>
<p>Well, we aren't getting any younger.</p>
<p>If we do eventually get engaged, I can see her parents demanding that COVID vaccines be a requirement for all guests.</p>

        <p>All I can say is make sure you and your girlfriend are on the same page with all this nonsense before getting engaged. I’ve heard of a lot of relationships ending between couples and family members during this time of illogical paranoia.</p>
