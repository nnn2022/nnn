    <strong>Experience working retail</strong>
    <p><p>I work in a luggage and purse store in a mall no one goes to. The other day this old lady came in after a group of 3 people (a mom and her  daughters about 16 years old) they left through the “entrance” and the old lady came in and she was wearing leather gloves, a cloth mask and a face shield and she says to me “i’m not putting on hand sanitizer because i’m not touching anything” and i’m just like ok. anyways, she comes up and starts barking at me about how that group of people left through the entrance and how employees do nothing when they’re customers aren’t following the rules. like for fucks sake what has the world come to. this lady clearly was coming into the store to harass me because she didn’t buy anything, she just did a lap around the store while yelling at me how i’m making excuses and shit. if you’re that concerned about covid, don’t come to the fucking mall. it’s so sad how retail and grocery store employees have been treated during all this. what was i supposed to do?? chase them down and tell them to go through the “exit”?? so ridiculous. there isn’t any “exit” or “entrance” signs as you leave the store so you can’t tell as you’re walking out which ones which but that’s not my fault, i’m just a keyholder. anyways, just needed to rant and let that out because that old lady really pissed me off.</p></p>
