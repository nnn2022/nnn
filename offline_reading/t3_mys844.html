    <strong>This post is for dummies who does not know anything about Covid-19 or are what people call COVIDIOTS</strong>
    <p><p>Covid-19 is real and is a threat like other disease. Stop saying that it's just like the flu. The main difference is that we have basically a lifetime immunity from the flu thanks to the vaccines. Yes, we have vaccines for Covid-19, but some will not take them because they are not sure, or they just hate vaccines, which probably only came into that result because how easy misinformation spreads in the internet especially social media. </p>
<p>For corruption and censorship just like people says, there is corruption, that's true; but it's also true that there's also corruption when it comes to people being overly racist to others, cancel culture, corporation scandals, and more. The main reason why it's pretty popular right now is because of Covid-19 being a very hot topic. </p>
<p>For people saying the masks infringes their rights or the regulations being too much, you are extremely wrong. The government says that you should wear if for everyone's safety, just like the government telling you to not drink while driving, skip lines, or do drugs. If it actually infringes your rights, then you are infringing the rights of the store, the private village you probably live in, or even the country you are living in. You are not the only person in the world, you know.</p>
<p>For people saying that the government lies about Covid-19, then I dare you to say to someone that survived the holocaust to say that it's not real, or saying that a famous person in the military who spent their whole life fighting to serve their country in a way deserved to die, then you just made almost everyone around you mad. You would feel sad if your loved one die, then feel angry when someone totally unrelated to you saying the he/she deserved it, you get the point.</p>
<p>For people saying that lockdowns does not make sense, you most likely do not see the whole picture. Let's say that there is a virus with a 1% death rate, 5% life-threatening rate, and 10% not-as-life threatening rate, which is higher the older you are, and there's a million people that got infected. 10k will die, 50k will have permanent scars on their body, and 100k will have a life-threatening condition which makes them prone to dying. It may not seem much, but consider how those cases will overrun the healthcare system, which was already struggling, and made it worse because a group of people thinks that it is fake at damages the reputation of front line workers even more. I can't say the full scale of the scenario, but you get the idea on how lockdowns reduce those effects at least.</p>
<p>I would gladly entertain more questions so that I could gladly educate people. For people downvoting because I don't agree with them, read the whole thing first.</p></p>

        <p>We do not have a lifetime immunity from the flu. You realize flu vaccines are just the most likely strains to appear that year right ? It's scientists taking their best guess. It's one of the reasons every once in awhile when they miss it becomes a bad flu season. Covid will probably be very similar to this.</p>
<p>Misinformation happens on both sides. I've literally had the same comment about the vaccine being experimental on covidiots because for some reason alot of people dont think it is there, which is infuriating because it just gives nnn easy ammo to call those people sheep and uninformed. </p>
<p>Im all for people getting the vaccine if they want to get it. If people want to wear masks and social distance they can. I'll do these things but it's not my place to tell others they have to do this. We dont need 100% vaccination for herd immunity anyway. If covid was infectious as we were led to believe you probably wouldn't even need half the population vaccinated. Israel got down to zero cases at 60% vaccinations.</p>

        <p>Um no, I adminster the flu jab to patients during flu seasons myself... and the golden is always that natural immunity is better than long lasting...
Vaccines are for diseases that kill you quicker than you develop natural immunity for...
Which is why at least in the UK, the flu jab is offered to immunocompramised, elderly, pregnant, carers working the vulnerable etc and others with certain diseases.</p>
<p>Fact is the majority of people never really get the flu jab here, I have never had it for example.</p>
<p>Secondly those vaccines have been tested for years, we know they work and are relatively safe.
Whereas these Covid ones are unlike any other vaccine before... these ones target mRNA, something which has never been done before, so we have no data on the long term effects.</p>
<p>Thirdly for over 99.7% of the population we will survive Covid and develop natural immunity, so there is NO need to make vaccine mandatory, especially and for a new one with no long term data.</p>
