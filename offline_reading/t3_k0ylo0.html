    <strong>What Happened to Living?</strong>
    <p><p>I believe in God &amp; Science.
I believe in God &amp; Evolution.
I believe in God &amp; Natural Selection.
I don't believe in suicide or abortion however, because it's murder. And I ain't a murderer.
Oh wait, yes I am. I am anti-mask.
A damn murderer out here with no mask.</p>
<p>I believe in dying for the greater good. 
To salvage the current predicament we have and the privileges our Sons, Father's, and Brothers already died for. 
What makes your life so damn special?</p>
<p>We are over-populated, and will soon be under-sourced. 
You win some, you lose some. 
We are too entitled, too worthy to die. Don't you know?
What happened to "I'm here for a good time, not a long time."?
What happened to YOLO?
Now we're out here dodging COVID like we're trying to be immortal.
Cool story bro.
Thought you didn't believe in gods?</p></p>

        <p>No kidding. It's like having a handful of people sprawling across the seats on a bus with excessive, unnecessary baggage taking up spots and they're like "SORRY NO MORE ROOM".</p>

        <p>It's all about perspective though right? With the narrative of limited resources, climate hoax, disease control, limited farmland, overpopulation would be the point at where the quality of these things go real bad. It fits the imagined reality.<br>
However with all these things being constructed or just made up nonsense it of course is a myth.</p>

        <p>What's interesting partly through the school system they've made the new religion called atheism to make people imagine a black void as the consequence of death. I believe this religion of atheism is very profitable to certain branches. <br>
I think the ridiculousness of the organized religions atm is a large part of why people accept this worldview with just as much evidence as any other religion.<br>
Because I hated the conversation/indoctrination of religion vs atheism in school when asked I said I considered myself an agnosticist and literally got called an idiot by the teacher.</p>
<p>Be afraid, get vaccinated, avoid conflict, buy health products, avoid risks etc... Atheism/Scientism helps it all.</p>

        <p>Excuse me? Atheism has been around for tens of thousands of years. It is just that today Atheists like myself are 'out and proud' and refuse to hide in the dark corners of society anymore because we are not criminals.</p>
