    <strong>Went to walmart today and these minimum wage minders literally read from a script...</strong>
    <p><p>As I walked in maskless the minder at the door asks me if I have a mask, to which I reply no.  She then points behind me and says that there are free ones I can use and if I dont put one on that "they" will close down the store.  I then said I have a medical condition and she said ok and left me alone.</p>
<p>Playing it back in my head, I could see the script that she was forced to memorize.  Patron enters without mask, offer mask, patron declines, threaten store closure.  Patron claims medical condition, no further questions in order to avoid HIPAA lawsuit.</p>
<p>I didnt want to stand there and educate her about what it actually is that she is being a willful accomplice of because I didnt have the time, but all we have to do is stand up, and hopefully inspire others to do the same.  I dont have to tell people in this sub what it is that we are trying to stop from happening, but the general population is none the wiser and willfully is headed to a hell from which there will be no turning back.</p></p>

        <p>i don't know why you have to emphasis that they are minimum wage people. They're people, with a minimum required wage that would be even lower if there wasn't a minimum wage. You don't know their situation and live experiences... they could have been really shit on by life.</p>
<p>corporate entities, like walmart, are big on creating scripts for their employees. It doesn't matter if they agree with it or not, but to keep their jobs they must comply with the corporate over-lords. as you've pointed out, they're being paid minimum required wages. They aren't paid enough to care and they likely don't have alternative income options to rely on if they try to challenge the corporate overlords.</p>
<p>You don't have to educate anyone, especially the lowest paid employees of a major corporation, about the ethics, logic, and validity of the script their corporate overlords forces them to repeat. If you want to educate anyone, then you should go to the administrators and the department that constructed the script and policies.</p>
<p>don't blame a person that has a pretty unfortunate job for trying to keep their job, blame the bosses and leaders.</p>

<p>But it's <strong>much</strong> easier to go on Reddit, and chastize these people. Most will agree with the sentiment (and they certainly do in this sub, because they blame retail workers for being "at fault" over the lockdowns) thus rewarding people like OP with plenty of karma and virtual brownie points.</p>
<p>I love how this sub sneers on virtue signalers when many on here do the same thing they do, just in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

        <p>There really arenâ€™t here in the US. Most chains are mask required or mask optional based on local state regulations. They donâ€™t want to get fined so they comply. People donâ€™t want to get arrested so they comply with the store. As they say ðŸ’© runs downhill.</p>

        <p>&rt;no further questions in order to avoid HIPAA lawsuit.</p>
<p>The greeter at WalMart is not bound by HIPAA at all, in regards to customers.  They can ask you whatever they like, medical or otherwise.  You, of course, are allowed (I would say encouraged) to ignore them.  HIPAA governs transactions between employer and employee and between hospital/doctor and patient and the insurance vultures.</p>

        <p>I guess an establishments refusal of service based off of undisclosed medical conditions would violate the ADA as opposed to HIPAA.  But would refusing services because you WONT disclose a medical condition violate HIPAA?</p>

        <p>No. HIPAA has nothing at all to do with interactions between you and a business, unless you are an employee there or are buying insurance from them (Hot Tip: Don't buy insurance at WalMart).</p>
<p>Here's the thing.  This kind of legal wrangling (HIPAA, ADA, medical exemptions, fucking Nuremberg Code, etc) is a fun thought exercise, but it isn't going to get you into a store if someone doesn't want you in there.  Period.  It's just not going to happen.  You could have F. Lee Bailey and the ghost of Sandra Day O'Connor on speed dial and you're still going to end up looking like one of those guys on YouTube getting hauled out yelling, "aM I BeInG DeTaInEd?!!!"  Quoting legalese, even when 100% correct, has no effect on the kind of mind who wants to flex on you for not wearing a face diaper.</p>
<p>Do it like this:</p>
<p>Enter store without mask</p>
<p>Shop until confronted</p>
<p>Ignore confronter and continue shopping</p>
<p>If confronter persists, drop what you're carrying and leave (get your eggs and anything packed in glass first in case this step is necessary)</p>
<p>Shop elsewhere, or go back for additional lulz.  Eventually, they'll give up.</p>
