    <strong>Is there a “civil war” in the anti-lockdown movement between pro-vaccine and vaccine-skeptical factions?</strong>
    <p><p>I just saw this press release on the website for Panda, which is the wonderful South African anti-lockdown advocacy group that created the viral-before-YouTube-banned-it “Ugly Truth About Lockdowns” video. The press release and video are below.</p>
<p>The press release describes how the organization’s scientific advisory board, which included the Great Barrington Declaration dream team and Scott Atlas, has now been dissolved over the fact that some members of the board came to think Panda was anti-vaccine and thus resigned. The press release then clarified that Panda is not anti-vaccine but believes the vaccine should be applied with a risk assessment depending on a person’s demographics and whether they’ve had COVID already. This being said, from what I’ve seen of Nick Hudson, the leader / spokesperson for Panda, in interviews and tweets is that he definitely is willing to engage with folks who are more classically “anti-vaccine” or far-right than say a goody-two-shoes like Martin Kuldorff. Nick Hudson also seems more willing to promote skepticism about Big Pharma’s financial incentives. There must have been a lot of drama going on behind the scenes at Panda!</p>
<p>There clearly is factionalism in the anti-lockdown movement. Obviously a subreddit like r/NoNewNormal is more diverse and ragtag than the heavily-moderated trying-to-be-respectable r/LockdownSkepticism. I think both sides are very important on some level in terms of promoting advocacy in different segments of society via different kinds of argumentation and protest techniques, so I am sad to see that there is infighting going on and possibly even the internal undermining of one of the most persuasive international anti-lockdown groups.</p>
<p>Personally, I am very pro-vaccine for the same reason I’m anti-lockdown... minor risks don’t bother me if there is a greater social good at stake. This being said, I am against coerced vaccines except maybe for folks who work in certain types of jobs like as nursing home staff, so this puts me in alignment with others who may be against the vaccine for themselves. I think that as an anti-lockdown movement we can have a diverse range of opinions as long as we all stand in general for humanist principles!</p>
<p>We can’t have a civil war in the movement! We must be united together whether we are goody-goody centrists who just wished our leaders followed 2019 pandemic science or whether we have more radical beliefs! This is a diverse coalition wanting the world to be a better place!</p>

        <p>What exactly are the known risks to getting vaccinated? I hear a lot about potential long term side effects which I understand. However, I feel that the same can be said about the coronavirus; the long-haulers who experience covid symptoms months after being infected.</p>
<p>Other than that, is there much risk involved? The CDC has been listening to VAERS reports, and we know that they have because that was how they learned about the J&amp;J vaccine blood clots in women. But even the chance of blood clots caused by the vaccine are lower than the average person's risk of blood clots, so taking the vaccine will barely increase your risk.</p>

        <p>I've found that the risk for clots is consistantly above average risk in the age group for all sexes.  The official reports are only a percent of the real incedence. And blood clots arent the only risk.</p>
<p>Another <em>really</em> important point is that we are over a year into the pandemic, almost everyone has already been exposed and has an amount of protection, so why risk it?</p>

        <p>I have no desire to force vaccines on others. I think it’s reasonable that certain professions require the vaccine if they are close-proximity to vulnerable populations, and people can choose not to work those jobs.</p>
<p>There can be unity between people who are pro-choice on vaccines but not against them as well with people who choose not to take the vaccines for themselves.</p>

        <p>Requiring is not forcing now? Wow.  No its not reasonable, you dont force people to do things with there body and you risk losing valuable employees for a tough job just to satisfy your idealogy.  Like masks, they dont even work</p>
<p>There is no unity between me and those who want to ruin my life, you are no different than the lockdowners and have far too much love of wanting to go with whatever society tells you no matter how bad</p>

        <p>I respect your view.</p>
<p>Do you think the legal brothels in Nevada should no longer require their prostitutes to be tested for STDs? Should legal prostitutes be required to get vaccinated for STDs like HPV... perhaps? That’s an extreme but compelling example!</p>
<p>Or should veterinarians be required to get vaccinated for rabies? In some places, I think they are already required.</p>
<p>Requiring vaccines or disease testing for jobs is not “a new normal”.</p>

        <p>As far as I’m aware, there’s no severe risks to getting an STD test. Vaccines are a permanent alteration to your body with potentially severe adverse reactions, some of which may not even be recognized yet (long term effects). Requiring that healthcare providers get tested for illnesses and/or use PPE and sanitation to avoid contaminating patients, is not a human rights violation compared to requiring them to get an irreversible injection. </p>
<p>We can only do so much to prevent spreading disease, something not even perfect vaccination can guarantee. Risking your own health and safety for a <em>chance</em> at prevention, isn’t something that should ever be mandated. I’m all in support of free choice and I certainly believe vaccines have their uses, but it’s not a decision to be taken lightly, and certainly not one that should be thrown around with blanket statements. I don’t want to see vaccines eradicated but they need to stop being treated like a dose of Tylenol. It should be a discussion between patient and doctor and no one else’s business.</p>

        <p>No vaccinations should be required or forced. Its security theater there too. You think if they get a test once a month and then turn 5 tricks a day it matters? How many people could they infect in that time if they arent following procedure anyway. And rabies ... its not that common, you know if youve been bitten, so then get the treatment after if you want. Another fear tactic, many rabid animals are tired/sick, not raging maniacs like you see in movies. </p>

<p>Lots of professions require sacrifices of freedom when it comes to licensing and such, and I don’t think it’s crazy to allow professions that right with COVID vaccines when there is a compelling reason. But I understand why others may disagree.</p>

        <p>The both examples you mentioned, (even though I disaree to call prostituion a job like any other) are both vaccines that are given to protect YOU, not others. If a vet got bitten and develops rabies, that's gonna screw HIM up, no one else. Same with HPV - I don't think the HPV vaccine can prevent spread 100%, and HPV infections in males are usually less harmful. </p>
<p>Covid vaccines that aren't approved by the FDA, for instance, are given to HCW aged 20-40 whose risk for dying of Covid is extremely low. Yet here it's suddenly mandatory not for your sake but the sake of others? Even though it's EUA? Nah.</p>

        <p>I understand your view on this and will potentially reconsider my policy lens.</p>
<p>I think a compromise where everyday people aren’t forced but it is just required for some jobs is still way better than universal mandatory vaccines. The reality may require people to accept a compromise to get us to victory.</p>

        <p>I'll say that vaccines are definitely the most polarizing topic here. Generally, people here can agree that governments shouldn't be implementing these crazy harmful mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns, and that you should be taking your own precautions and letting others do the same. That's what unites us, not anything regarding the vaccine. I think that's what we all need to stay focused on. But, the vaccine is currently a more popular topic than all the others at this point, so you'll naturally see many posts and comments about it.</p>
<p>You have some who are overall anti-vaxx, some who are only anti-vaxx when it comes to this particular one, some who are merely just skeptical about it, and some who aren't bothered by it. Most people seem to be in the middle, and either just against this particular vaccine, or are just skeptical of it.</p>
<p>As you said, I think we need to focus on what unites us. I've definitely seen growing amounts of hostility towards fellow members who disagree with someone on the vaccine, or comments that express frustration towards those who aren't as gung ho when it comes to opposing the the restrictions.</p>
<p>That said, I think that all of the differing opinions aren't a bad thing, and shows how we're a very open group - all we ask is that you be against the "new normal" in some kind of fashion. So naturally, opinions will differ.</p>
<p>Just please remember, same team, everyone.</p>

<p>The thing is that there is no way this movement will win without being pro-vaccine in some sense. Being pro-vaccine (at least for older adults or at-risk folks) but also pro-choice is the only position with mainstream support anywhere that can realistically bring life back to the old normal. That’s basically the Ron DeSantis position... not to mention the Donald Trump view too.</p>
