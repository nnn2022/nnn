        <p>We walk around without faces because some government employee said so. We’re more fed up with how long this has gone on and how we’ve been forced into this never ending loop of lost freedom in the forms of movement, travel, commerce, and even our individuality in small bits that have added up to almost, and soon to be well past, a full year. We’re fucking done, so go back to your phony “The Science” subs! Get out of our only sanctuary! Please! Fuck off!</p>

        <p>Also, what do you think a small piece of fabric is doing to stop a fraction of a micron virus? From my limited experience in biology, I’ll tell you it does nothing. I think deep down everyone knows that. Evidence? The state of Florida. Last time I checked, Florida had just over 25,000 deaths total for a state of 21 million. Next let’s check the deadlocked state of New York. Before cuomo’s nursing home “scandal”, I read about 50,000 deaths in a state of 18 million. So, tell me what a “thin piece of fabric” is doing besides giving everyone the false sense of safety.</p>

        <p>It acts as a barrier method its a simple idea. Some of the particles spread by coughing and sneezing are blocked by the face mask. Not every particle is blocked but it does do something and it will block some of the particles from reaching your body</p>

        <p>Dr fauci wrote a paper in 2008 stating that most of the deaths during the spanish flu were caused by bacterial pneumonia from constant mask wearing. Now hes asking people to wear them for 12 hour shifts. Research further into bill gates and dr fauci. These people are as corrupt as it gets.  They dont care about your health. Its about more government control and its working like a charm due to people always thinking it might go back to normal if they just give up a few more rights.</p>

        <p>Why are you so supportive of wearing masks? Have you seen conclusive evidence that justifies wearing masks? Is that evidence more compelling than the evidence that masks can cause other issues such as cancer and headaches?</p>
<p>Now that we have the more scientific argument out of the way, we can look at the political side. My body, my choice. If you’re afraid of getting sick, stay the fuck home. If you’re afraid of getting in a car accident, don’t get in a fucking car. If you do not like dehumanizing people, don’t wear a fucking mask (did you know it’s easier for people to kill people with their faces covered because they do not feel as much like they are killing an actual person?).</p>
<p>I could easily go on and on about many different reasons why I do not want to wear a mask, but I’d be happy to hear if you have any reasons you think mask wearing is such an essential point. Also, if you could please wear a mask (or just a small bit of fabric) in your anus while you type your response to me, I would greatly appreciate it. Should you choose not to comply, that is fine as well, but I would appreciate an explanation as to why you were unwilling to comply with my request.</p>

        <p>Did you wear the mask in your anus like I requested when replying on this forum? If not, why not? </p>
<p>Each business and transport form has the right to chose their own requirements unless it is government affiliated, in which case it is required to be in compliance with the US Constitution (as an American, I assume the world revolves around Murika, so I am using that context). How are you going to justifying denying my right to expression in a public place such as this? The burden of proof should not be on me to proof why I shouldn’t have to wear a mask, but on the oppressors trying to force me to behave in a specific manner. Otherwise what is to stop public services from denying service to anyone that wears a t-shirt saying “Fuck Congress”, which I think 90+% of the population would support?</p>

        <p>&rt;Its literally just a small bit of fabric you wear while your in shops or transport </p>
<p>Yea something like smoking cigarettes why it's so bad, lets see.</p>
<p><em>Dyspnea variation was significantly higher with surgical mask</em></p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29395560/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29395560/</a></p>
<p><em>Ventilation, cardiopulmonary exercise capacity and comfort are reduced by surgical masks and highly impaired by FFP2/N95 face masks in healthy individuals.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7338098/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7338098/</a></p>
<p><em>Wearing an N95 mask significantly reduced the PaO2 level (101.7 +/- 12.6 to 92.7 +/- 15.8 mm Hg, p = 0.006), increased the respiratory rate (16.8 +/- 2.8 to 18.8 +/- 2.7/min, p &lt; 0.001), and increased the occurrence of chest discomfort (3 to 11 patients, p = 0.014) and respiratory distress (1 to 17 patients, p &lt; 0.001).</em></p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15340662/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15340662/</a></p>
<p><em>Irritant contact dermatitis was common on the cheeks and nasal bridge due to pressure and friction. Irritant dermatitis was associated with personal history of atopic dermatitis and prolonged mask wear (&rt;6 hours)</em></p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33011325/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33011325/</a></p>
<p><em>Respiratory pathogens on the outer surface of the used medical masks may result in self-contamination. The risk is higher with longer duration of mask use (&rt; 6 h) and with higher rates of clinical contact.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31159777/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31159777/</a></p>
<p>And other side effects affecting the heart</p>
<p>Inconsistent breathing, even slight, profoundly affects heart rate variability (HRV) And breathing constantly through masks certainly affect HRV. Read more here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4311559/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4311559/</a></p>
<p>Also with respect to environment</p>
<p><em>...disposable face masks (single use) that get to the environment (disposal in landfill, dumpsites, freshwater, oceans or littering at public spaces) could be emerging new source of microplastic fibers, as they can degrade/fragment or break down into smaller size/pieces of particles under 5 mm known as microplastics under environmental conditions. The Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis (see Supporting Information for details) of the degrading face masks (</em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7297173/figure/f0015/"><em>Fig. 3</em></a> <em>) was carried out using PerkinElmer, UATR Two, USA, against a plastic specific spectral library (Perkin Elmer ATR of Polymers Library). The spectra showed a characteristic peaks of a polypropylene for the outer layer (</em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7297173/figure/f0015/"><em>Fig. 3</em></a><em>a) and polyethylene high density for the inner layer (</em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7297173/figure/f0015/"><em>Fig. 3</em></a><em>b). The spectra provide a piece of evidence that face masks could increase the accumulation of their related microparticles in the environment within a short time.</em></p>
<p><em>Another implication of this indiscriminately disposed face masks in the environment is the possibility of acting as a medium for disease outbreak, as plastic particles are known to propagate microbes such as invasive pathogens</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7297173/"><em>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7297173/</em></a></p>
<p>Plus the various elements in a mask</p>
<p><strong><em>Polyester</em></strong> <em>is a synthetic fabric that derives from petroleum, which essentially makes polyester a byproduct of oil. For the consumer, the issue with this fabric is that it doesn’t breathe as natural fibers do, which means that your sweat can’t evaporate, which is uncomfortable and can cause acne and rashes. For the environment, the consequences are even greater as polyester is not naturally broken down, which is a big problem as it continues to fill our landfills and oceans.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Neoprene</em></strong> <em>(wetsuit fabric) is a synthetic fabric. The North American Contact Dermatitis Group performed 10 years of research into neoprene allergy, and found that sensitive individuals can develop allergic reactions ranging from simple redness to painful blisters. For many people, the only way to avoid a reaction is to avoid the product.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Acrylics</em></strong> <em>can be found in anything from sweaters to masks. The issue with acrylics is that they contain</em> <strong><em>dimethylformamide</em></strong>*, a chemical known to cause liver damage. This chemical is so potent that the people who manufacture acrylic fibers have to wear protective gloves just to touch the clothing they are making.*</p>
<p><strong><em>Conventional Cotton</em></strong>*: We tend to think of cotton as a “natural” fabric, which to a certain extent it is. While cotton is grown from the ground and not in a lab, the cotton used in the fashion industry is usually still treated with a concerning amount of toxic chemicals. Typically cotton that is used in textiles is treated with pesticides, colored with toxic dyes, and treated with chemical coatings in order to give clothing the bright and shiny effects that consumers are drawn to. And while we all may love the convenience of having a wrinkle-free dress, all of those added chemicals make this “natural” fiber anything but natural.*</p>
<p><strong><em>Azo dyes</em></strong> <em>are common synthetic dyes used for coloring clothes, leather, and textiles. These dyes contain amines, which have been shown to increase the risk of bladder cancer in dye factory workers and hairdressers. The next time you’re looking for a dress in your favorite color, try reaching for a product with organic dyes to avoid these toxic effects.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Phthalates</em></strong> <em>are a fast fashion favorite. They are used in waterproof clothing, so think raincoats and leather. These phthalates are known “endocrine disruptors” that have been linked to both male and female reproductive issues because they interfere with how hormones communicate with our bodies.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Nanosilver</em></strong> <em>is an antimicrobial agent used to treat a wide variety of medical equipment, including gloves and face masks. Some research has already found that silver nanoparticles can kill brain cells in exposed rodents. There is also a concern that this risk may apply to humans as well, but lack of research has made it determine what level of exposure is considered dangerous and what the long term effects could be.</em></p>
<p><em>Anything that advertises itself as</em> <strong><em>static resistant, stain-resistant, flame retardant or wrinkle-free</em></strong> <em>develops these properties by being treated with formaldehyde, nonylphenol ethoxylates, or triclosan. These chemicals are absorbable through the skin and have been associated with reproductive and developmental effects in rodents, and potentially in humans as well.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Formaldehyde</em></strong> <em>has also been associated with skin reactions and nasopharyngeal cancer and is a likely culprit for facial dermatitis that is being seen in healthcare workers required to wear face masks all day while at work. Studies on factory workers who are exposed to triclosan suggest that regular exposure may contribute to increased cancer risk.</em></p>
<p><em>Despite these known effects of these chemicals, there is no regulation for the number of chemicals that can be used in products sold in the United States or a requirement for brands to report which chemicals are used in their clothing.</em></p>

<p>The difference is you may smoke a cigarette for few mins. Facemask you constantly wear it. And it's not to perform a task.</p>

        <p>I am my own person, not the product of society. If we begin to question people why they don't accept this or that, next someone will ask if they could jizz on our legs once a month, it's just some liquid.
Besides, masks impair your breathing by preventing you to exhale properly and by making you inhale back what you've exhaled. This is not only stopping your O2 uptake, it's pushing CO2 into you.
But, we shouldn't even get to the point of discussing the health hazards. It's about freedom first. All other damage is consequential.</p>

        <p>I can't speak for everyone but to me they're both ineffective and pretty much a violation of my rights supposedly guaranteed by the spirit of the constitution.  I'll add in I know a lot of 'older' people who have had COVID and nobody has died.  I think the hype is overblown and between the 'news' and social media it's silly.  Secondly why is everybody so afraid of dying?  Its a natural fact of this game.  Nobody gets out alive.  When death comes to tap you on the shoulder and say 'follow me' it's your time.  Can't escape it.  Part of my thing is why should I protect you?  Sure if I'm sick and symptomatic I do the responsible thing.  I stay home and avoid people.  Be it the flu, which I currently have, or any other sickness that I think can spread.  You people want everybody to protect you.  I don't need anybody to protect me thanks but no thanks.  I'll take my chances with my individual liberty in tact.</p>

        <p>I know that it makes an unbelievably negligible difference, if any, to whether or not you contract any virus, and I hate doing things that don't make sense. I particularly hate doing things that don't make sense when they have been imposed on me by any authority. </p>
<p>And I'm not sure what other people's experience might be, but for me wearing a mask is deeply uncomfortable, as I have allergies, my nose is constantly blocked up, and it makes it difficult to breeze. It's not actually hazardous to my health, but it is unpleasant even for just a few minutes (I know because I had to wear one in a library, as I needed to print something out, and they wouldn't have let me in otherwise! I only wore one for two minutes, and that was quite enough for me), so there is no prospect of me wearing one for a lengthy period of time, or on any form of regular basis.</p>
