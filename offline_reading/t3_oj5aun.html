    <strong>The disregard for obvious logic is frightening.</strong>
    <p><p>If the Vax works then those who have it are protected. It's the ones who don't take it who are at risk. So why is everyone so concerned with people taking a voluntary risk if they themselves are in theory protected? If everyone at your workplace is vaccinated and you are not then how are you putting them at risk at all? Yet if you try and bring this argument up it's like talking to a brick wall. The fear mongering, virtue signaling, and straight propaganda is so deeply embedded in our culture Its actually sickening. To say that there are new variants that are "spreading amongst the unvaxed" just makes no logical sense at all. You are telling me that all the unvaxed people are gathering around and spreading covid to one another and creating "variants"? That just doesn't make sense. I'm extremely disheartened to hear the news of the decision in France because more countries will follow. The only way to stop this is mass noncompliance, but we all know that there is no way that will happen. People are actually happy to hear the news of mandatory vaccinations. Since when have people been happy about the government making anything mandatory? The few of us who see straight through this bullshit have to resist, we cannot let them achieve their goal of controlling of us all. There isn't really a point to all of this except that I want to vent it, especially before the inevitable take down of this sub. I really had hope they would just jab everyone who wanted it and leave the rest of us alone but sadly that is not reality. Stay strong everyone, don't stop seeking the truth and spreading it to anyone who will listen. Dark times ahead for us if we all follow the majority and give in to whatever the government wants.</p></p>

        <p>About 5 or 6 years ago there was a measles outbreak at Disneyland.  The authorities told people who are NOT vaccinated to stay away because they were at risk but those who were vaccinated are generally safe.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years and now it's every freaking person MUST have the vaccine or EVERYBODY is at risk whether vaccinated or not.  And don't forget that the definition of "herd immunity" has been changed to reflect a certain percentage of the population being vaccinated rather than the original definition which was a more organic "herd immunity."</p>
<p>This is all some Ministry of Truth level malfeasance going on. People - vaccinated or not, skeptical or not - need to wake tf up quickly because there's something evil going on and most of the population is too brainwashed to see it.</p>

        <p>Agreed.  It keeps getting worse and more arbitrary.  How can people either not notice or not care that rules and definitions are literally being changed to suit the narrative? Whatever is going on, I do not for a minute believe it's about a virus.  At least not a "virus" in the normal sense of the word.  A virus of authoritarianism and control, definitely.</p>

        <p>You couldn’t be more right!  It’s so upside down the thinking that goes on with the extreme vaxers. They cannot honk for themselves and are not open to seeing anything from the other side, I think most of us o. This side have looked at both sides and came up with a conclusion. It’s a choice and should remain a choice! I will go down fighting, no one is gonna force me to get this.</p>

        <p>Have your groceries delivered. I have done this this they started here. Just because I hate grocery shopping. The one good thing to come out of COVID. Work is another thing. Let them fire so you can collect unemployment?  Probably not nearly enough to live on though. Hopefully it won’t come to that. I’m scared too. That’s what they want though so you get the vaccine.</p>

<p>Mark my words. Eventually, they will require an "updated health passport" in order to have stuff delivered. They're going to have all their bases covered. </p>
<p>And before you say, "BUT THEY'LL LOSE BUSINESS FROM THAT, SO STFU". No. They won't care. This is about fulfilling an agenda. Losing some chump change from us won't matter to them.</p>

        <p>Hopefully not! Where I live (in Upstate NY) things the last few weeks seem to be just like normal. No masks, full movie theaters, too much traffic(ugh) Just had my groceries delivered. Lol  over the 4th we went to watching Glenn to hike the falls and there were soooooo many people. Maybe 1% masked. Lots of foreigners Chinese and Indian. All packed liked cattle together waiting to be slaughtered walking up the falls.(it’s beautiful by the way) thought for sure well if I was gonna get covid this was gonna be it. I feel absolutely fine! Been going to the gym and running everyday! So what the hell is everyone so freaked about? This is the absolute definition of insanity! I could of already had this virus and didn’t know it and have the antibodies? I’m 55 and not dead yet and if they require health passports it’s gonna piss half this country off. Half this world off, if not more! I wish them luck with that! Absolute totalitarianism !  Oh and I saw plenty of Amish with their kids there too… unmasked!! Just had to add that!</p>

        <p>Well I’m not lying. I wish I took pictures when I was at the Glenn. Too many people and everyone had their cameras out and my mission was just to climb up . It was a struggle to just keep moving. It’s only 1.5 miles up and it took an hour to get up. And we were weaving in and out . Mind you the part of the state I live in is pretty Red. Not that that  should have anything to do with it. But going to one of the biggest tourist attractions over the 4th was eye open wing to me! We went cuz we thought it would t be crowded compared to previous years. That wasn’t the case. Which I have to admit bummed me out cuz I love to hike and have it peaceful. This was not. Where do you live if you don’t mind me asking?</p>

        <p>That’s cool. I get it. We are headed to northern Vermont in a couple of weeks for a vacation. So hopefully it won’t be wear a mask,blah blah blah. We mostly will be hiking and biking but want to eat out and stuff. They are not asking for proof of vaccination to cross into the state and neither is the rental agency. Which made me happy.</p>
