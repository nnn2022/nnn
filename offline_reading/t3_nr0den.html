    <strong>SELF magazine: Yes, Your Employer Can Require You to Get a COVID-19 Vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>&rt; Ultimately, the only way an employer can require someone who doesn't want to get the vaccine to actually get it is if the employer can prove the employee poses a “direct threat” to others in the workplace that can't be eliminated through other accommodations. Considering the high legal threshold for proving that someone is, in fact, a direct threat to other people, many companies have so far held off on putting a full vaccination mandate in place, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/01/business/workplace-vaccine-requirements.html"><em>The New York Times</em> reported</a>.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;For now, employers are increasingly considering offering incentives for those who do get vaccinated rather than outright requiring it for everyone. The EEOC didn't give specific examples of incentives that are okay, but did say that the incentives can't be large enough that they could be considered coercive. Even if the incentives aren't coercive, “a very large incentive could make employees feel pressured to disclose protected medical information,” the commission said.</p>

<p>The title and first half of the piece are misleading, in my opinion. Nowhere is it noted that the COVID "vaccines" are not FDA approved, nor are they traditional vaccines. It seems to aim to scare employees into getting the jabs.</p></p>

        <p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>In 49 states, employment at will states.  They can't make you get a vaccine.   They can require you to provide proof of vaccination as a condition of employment.   Those are two different things.</p>

        <p>EEOC has recently even made their support of mandatory vaccinations known. </p>
<p>While the shots are in EUA status, the argument that an employer cannot require an employee get the shot is arguably winnable, but it might require filing suit for declaratory/injunctive relief. <a href="https://www.nmstandsup.org">https://www.nmstandsup.org/</a>  is an example.</p>
<p>Lawsuit has just been filed in Texas against Harris Methodist. <a href="https://employercovidpolicy.com/healthcare-heroes-deserve-freedom/">https://employercovidpolicy.com/healthcare-heroes-deserve-freedom/</a> Plaintiffs cite Nuremberg and Helsinki (CFR).</p>
<p>There are fed (and some state) exemptions. Religious exemption under Title VII requires an employer to accommodate if basically it's easy to do. <a href="https://employercovidpolicy.com/one-possible-religious-exemption/">https://employercovidpolicy.com/one-possible-religious-exemption/</a> . Under the ADA, the employer must accommodate a disability. The burden of proof for the employer too prove the accommodation creates an undo hardship is more difficult. Ultimately, it's still possible to require depending on the accommodation. Some state legislatures are considering legislation.</p>
