    <strong>Cv19 &amp; vaccine passports</strong>
    <p><p>Hi I have been following this cv19 since day dot and and how it came about in China ( i still think from a lab ( or maybe its another government hoax ) to control the people..</p>
<p>I am no way shape or form an anti vaxxer. But I do believe that everyone has a choice ( well did ) to get the vaccine. Because its our body. I have spoken to many other who have the same opinion as me. </p>
<p>Its has been slow control since the first lockdown , and its been creeping up ever since. Its amazing what media does to people. ( I don't own a tele not done in 3 years ) </p>
<p>From saying oh not vaccine passports will be needed . To saying yesterday actually we getting them by end of September.</p>
<p>Also saying if your not vaccinated and doubled jabbed by than.. well you can say goodbye to your freedom. No nightclubs ( not bothered about that) no large events ( concerts etc) </p>
<p>This is where me you and the people lose choice in having it. And being forced to have it.. </p>
<p>My OT her husband had the cv19 jab months ago . He ended up in hospital for 3 weeks on a ventilation and nearly died. And he don't want the 2nd one ( do I blame him ..nope ) </p>
<p>This is slowly becoming a nazi regime</p></p>

        <p>The ironic part is lockdowns actually make it worse. People need to be outside and in the sun. It does wonders for your health. What has killed me this entire pandemic is I haven't heard any government official talk about how to help your body get healthy. Instead it's all lockdowns. My son is 4 years old and several parks in my area have been closed the entire pandemic. All my son wants to do is go play at the park with other kids. Kids whom are literally at the least likely to get or transmit this virus. All to protect a group of people who are more at risk. Instead those who are at high risk should be the ones to stay at home and keep socially distant. Everyday I feel like we're getting closer and closer to 1984. between the governments and social media censorship I feel were doomed by those in power.</p>

        <p>I did ok in lockdown I worked out , and walked. Sorry to hear about your wain ( kid). I have a park near me which this cut off and other ones near me.. im like there kids for ffs. George orwell did say this would happen and he predicted it.. I have a liver disease that's why I chose not to take the jab(s) yeah I could take it and be ok or I could end up worse the next day or weeks later. I'm not playing lucky dip with my health or life. Bojo putting passport's into use by end of September . Proves that his power of his government can control our daily life and freedom. Like I said have a jabs and a passport have freedom. Dont have them lose everything you become to know..</p>

        <p>It's already been going on for almost a century but this last year and a half has been the fastest destruction of freedom in history.  The more power and total control you give them, the more they yearn for it and aren't willing to give it up.  It may take some serious revolts at this point</p>

        <p>Yes but I think they want it as an excuse to introduce martial law and move things up a gear.</p>
<p>Last few uk protests have been peaceful, so I expect them to wheel out the agent provocateurs shortly.</p>

        <p>I never really realised how bad NI was until grew up. I watched the Liam Neason film about the birth of the IRA and I can’t really say I’d be happy if an invading force just put a massive divide in my country and even life. I know it’s probably not a good account of the story but it opened my eyes to some of the evil tactics the British used. I am British myself and I am ashamed on a daily basis on that things we do and have done.</p>
