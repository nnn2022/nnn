    <strong>Does anyone else think that pro-lockdown doctors are clouded by emotion?</strong>
    <p><p>Example: my friend is a physiotherapist and actually got to treat 3 elderly patients who suffered long-term consequences from a covid infection. She also lives with her grandmother. As you can expect she is totally pro-lockdown, pro-mask wearing and buys into all of the hysteria. I understand that she wants to keep the elderly and her grandma safe, but can't she understand that there are better ways to do that without ruining everyone else's lives?</p>
<p>Even other doctors, they keep pushing videos in the news about a handful of overwhelmed hospitals and saying 'I was there! I saw patients on the ventilator! It's horrible and we must prevent this!'. And I don't think that they really comprehend that those few dozen patients are a drop in the bucket next to the thousands of infected people who had corona pass over like a cold.</p>
<p>I've seen this happen with other things. When someone a person cares about dies, suddenly they might become obsessed with what killed them. A heart attack? Then EVERYONE should eat healthy and they might become an activist for healthy eating. Drunk driving? Well then they might campaign to tell people not to drink and drive. Cancer? Maybe they'll start up a charity. Suicide? They'll suddenly start caring about mental health when they didn't give a shit before.</p></p>

        <p>Not sure overall whether it’s emotion that drives doctors. Of the good ones, it’s more likely to be professional loyalty, malpractice concerns and general conformism.</p>

        <p>Dr's get paid extra for prescribing certain drugs. I think they are quite easy to buy!</p>

        <p>Clouded by emotion or "clouded by funding"?</p>
<p>There are some who buy into this, but are basically brainwashed.  The driving force behind is funding. For example</p>
<p>&rt; Cancer? Maybe they'll start up a charity. </p>
<p>Yeah, but if you notice the "charity" is about some drug. It's not about health.</p>

        <p>No. I think they are clouded by whomever is paying them to be so. Somewhere, somehow, money is exchanging hands. That's what it's all about.</p>

        <p>I know plenty of physicians, some top of their field who teach med school.</p>
<p>They are all 100% anti-lockdown and do not think this is worth the hysteria, at all. My pulmonologist told me swine flu concerned him more than this ever did - especially considering my own health (I had both and he said he was way more concerned for my health with swine flu than when I had Covid).</p>
<p>Same with nurses who treat Covid patients that I know. All BS.</p>

        <p>Okay if it doctors, how bout nurses? They aren’t really in the funding cycle.</p>
<p>Yes, I believe clinicians on the ground are clouded by emotion. Smart people who are good with math and science are still human, and can get be very vulnerable to the “we must do SOMETHING” fallacy. They see people suffer, and they (often quite heroically) treat the sickest of the sick, then they log on to the news or social media and it looks like one group is trying to fix the tragedy and the other group is thumbing their nose at it. Then they go down the wrong rabbit hole and confirmation bias keeps them down there forever.</p>
