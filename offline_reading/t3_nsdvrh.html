<p>I‚Äôve seen this term used way too much just this year alone but this blind trust in someone who claims they are a doctor, or have a doctorate, or expert professionals...this has been on the rise since 90‚Äôs (to my knowledge but could be sooner). </p>
<p>Like...a doctorate in what? Is it relevant to the subject? What are the other certifications and credentials? An expert in what? What made you so? Can you back up who your mentor in the subject was? Where did you study this issue? How long did you study the issue? </p>

<p>It's nothing more than psychological programming. And when you break it down...</p>
<p>First they teach you to "trust the experts", "trust the science".</p>
<p>Then, the media reports their propaganda with "experts say", "the science says/shows us" and it is literally everywhere.</p>

        <p>Worst part is that this is largely true. Hell im going to be honest I was compliant in the early early stages. I didn‚Äôt know wtf this was, what was going on and considering both me and the love of my life have heart issues/lung issues this was concerning. So we went wfh, wore masks and limited outings. In the like the first month..</p>
<p>By May/June though we saw the sensationalist media being written and hyped and we started to question and we‚Äôve been questioning since. </p>
<p>After we just went out when we needed something (as usual) and if we wanted to go do something fun we would. Invite our few friends for game of MTG, or meet at the river to go swimming. Idk..just..all this is reeking of hoax.</p>

        <p>The pandemic is slowing, but experts say conditions are in place for a fungus epidemic</p>

<p>SAN ANTONIO - As we are working to heal from one pandemic, experts say conditions are in place for a black fungus epidemic.</p>
<p>It's called mucormycosis and it's spreading across India where high rates of diabetes and a rampant COVID-19 outbreak have created the perfect storm.</p>
<p>Medical professionals believe the most susceptible people for mucormycosis are those with weekend immune systems.</p>
<p>Professor Soo Chan Lee is part of UTSA‚Äôs Department of Biology and one of the world‚Äôs leading experts on the disease.</p>
<p>Lee says what we are seeing in India could play out in other areas of the world with high rates of immunocompromised individuals.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAmong COVID patients and post covid patients, we see the skyrocketing of cases,‚Äù Lee said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs possible patients may get exposed to the mucormycosis drug, they can get infections but we can treat that. We can cure that.‚Äù</p>
<p>At UTSA, Professor Lee is doing extensive research to find out how the black fungus interacts with our immune systems.</p>
<p>He says the biggest problem is that it's resistant to antifungal drugs and that's the puzzle piece he's working to solve.</p>

        <p>India is in the shape they‚Äôre in thanks to decades of abuse by the Rockefeller Syndicate, Monsanto, DDT use, pollution and eugenics programs disguised as humanitarian efforts with repeated ‚Äúvaccinations‚Äù of malnourished children and adults.</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄúIn addition to the rise in AFP that correlates with rising OPV dosing in India, there are numerous reports of vaccine viruses mutating to virulence, causing polio outbreaks in China, Nigeria, and India.</strong> As always, the finger is pointed at under-vaccinated populations rather than at the vaccine itself or the myriad other causes of viral mutation. ^1</p>
<p>Apart from the resilience of circulating wild-type viruses, major problems have emerged as a result of intrinsic properties of the OPV. <strong>It has the propensity to escape its designated role as a protecting immunogen by circulating in poorly immunized populations, thereby evolving into highly neurovirulent poliovirus strains after recombination with other enteroviruses</strong> (Kew et al, 2005; P. Jiang, J.A.J. Faase, A.E. Gorbalenya and E. Wimmer, unpublished data). This independent occurrence in different
parts of the world causes yearly outbreaks of poliomyelitis.</p>
<p>We often hear that OPV circulating in poorly immunized populations is wonderful because the unvaccinated get the benefit. <strong>But OPV vaccines will always be able to recombine with enteroviruses no matter how highly vaccinated the population, and dangerous recombination viruses that cause paralysis will not be called ‚Äúpolio.‚Äù This is one way that a mountain of new AFP cases builds, while GAVI and WHO celebrate eradication of polio.‚Äù</strong></p>
<p><strong>‚ÄúIt is worth noting that DDT production rose dramatically in the United States after 1954,‚Äù</strong> Jim West remarks, ‚Äúwhich is primarily connected to the fact that <strong>DDT was increasingly exported to the Third World,</strong> to be used primarily in programs to fight malaria or in agriculture.‚Äù ^2</p>
<p><strong>If WHO‚Äôs plan succeeds, the artificially immune herd stands to become the completely non- immune herd, as new children are born who have not been infected with wild-type viruses or even exposed to vaccine poliovirus. This condition has never existed in human history.</strong> Under these conditions, any reintroduction of poliovirus could be disastrous to this newly virgin population. The people of India, Pakistan, and Nigeria stand to become more vulnerable to viral reintroduction than any population ever before. ^1</p>
<p>‚ÄúDuring the United States epidemics, roughly 50-80 percent of the population was naturally immune to at least one type of poliovirus. Wild poliovirus alone in healthy people was never a major threat. Natural herd immunity has always been protective (recall Xavante natives). <strong>In due time, India‚Äôs people will have the lowest level of herd protection ever, and in the face of continued DDT use, intramuscular injections of antibiotics, diets high in sugar and low in essential vitamins, and stress, their susceptibility to paralytic disease is enormous.</strong>
If poliovirus is reintroduced into the toxic, unhealthy, immunologically naive population‚Äîfrom residual samples stored in laboratories, some of which are highly neurovirulent (recall 1916 New York City); circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses; or poliovirus that is chemically synthesized the potential outcome is unfathomable.</p>
<p>Today children are forced to submit to vaccines because the WHO and others are just targeting wild poliovirus and not the problem of paralysis. Once this very shortsighted goal is met, there will undoubtedly be future trouble. The WHO knows this and already has considered the steps necessary to deal with the immunologically naive population if viral reintroduction occurs.</p>
<p>History books of the future may reflect upon a disaster with this conclusion: <strong>Wild poliovirus should have been left alone and the real sources of paralysis pursued and addressed.‚Äù</strong></p>
