    <strong>"Delta" Variant = "Panic Porn Dressed Up As Science"</strong>
    <p><p>"In other words, Delta is literally the flu with a CFR identical to it. <strong>This is exactly what every respiratory pandemic has done through history: morphed into more transmissible and less virulent form that forces the other mutations out since you get that one.</strong> Nothing about masks, lockdowns, or experimental shots did this. To the extent this really is more transmissible, it's going to be less deadly, as is the case with the common cold. To the extent that there are areas below the herd immunity threshold (for example, in Scotland and the northwestern parts of the U.K.) they will likely get the Delta variant (until something else supplants it), but fatalities will continue to go down...<strong>The bad news is that after Delta, there are Epsilon and 19 other letters of the Greek alphabet, which will enable the circuitous cycle of misinformation, fear, panic, and control</strong> to continue. And remember, as there is already a "Delta+," the options are endless until our society finally achieves immunity to COVID panic porn."</p>
<p>Just wait until fall and winter when those that had "vax" experience the common cold (a coronavirus) and the flu and we get the real pandemic vs the current casedemic:</p>

<p>I suggest everyone just take vitamin D and C, eat healthy and exercise...  because there’s too many variants</p>
