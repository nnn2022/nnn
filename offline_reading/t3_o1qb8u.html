    <strong>"Long Covid" and "Permanent lung damage" data, where is it?</strong>
    <p><p>I see these terms bandied about here sometimes, and whenever I ask for the data, excluding anecdotal, I get no reply. But I want to know about these things. I don't want to be pedantic and say "how can you know it's permanent, we're only a year and a half into this thing?", but that's kind of a point too. But seriously, where is the hard data on so-called 'Long Covid', whatever that is? Where are the numbers on 'Permanent Lung Damage'?</p>
<p>I welcome both 'sides' to respond to this; if you have a case, make it. But again, anecdotes don't count.</p></p>

        <p>My Swedish friend keeps banging on about this. She says it's well documented and the percentage of patients with permanent lung damage is high, but she can never provide a source or even a figure when I ask how high it's supposed to be. </p>
<p>Through her circle of friends and family she claims to know 'hundreds' of people who have caught COVID. Not a single person in that group of 'hundreds' has died or has been hospitalised and each and every one has described their symptoms as 'a bad cold' or had no symptoms at all. </p>
<p>Despite this she wishes that Sweden had placed more restrictions on everybody's lives. This is all because she claims that her boyfriend has permanent lung damage because of COVID.</p>
<p>Of the 'hundreds' she knows, he is the only one who has any permanent damage.</p>
<p>He recovered from lung cancer in 2019 and started smoking again in 2020, but she dismisses the possibility that this could have anything to do with it...</p>

<p>Lol, before I even got to this line I was preparing to ask if he's a smoker.  </p>
<p>He's making excuses for his addiction, blaming his breathing problems on Covid, and she's an idiot enabling him.</p>

        <p>In cases where people were on ventilators, there probably is lung damage associated with covid but mostly caused by the vent itself.. well known medical fact that ventilators damage the lungs. Little evidence for specific lung damage for use of ventilators in covid patients.</p>
<p>For long covid, it's possible there are long lasting effects .. but there is little data to suggest that at present.. right now I would (talking from personal experience) assume that 95% of people saying they have "long covid" actually just have anxiety. </p>
<p>Unless you've suffered with proper anxiety, you really don't know how real your body makes your symptoms and how debilitating it can be. Constantly bombarded with fear porn and genuinely thinking there is a deadly pathogen floating around all over the place is enough to make even the toughest of characters anxious. </p>
<p>The most common symptoms of anxiety are conveniently, shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain/tightness, hot flushes, cold sweats... </p>
<p>Someone who has had covid, or even just worried about covid,  if anything like me, will be constantly monitoring their breathing, feeling for any resistance, wheeze, shortness of breath.. it's like that thing some annoying people do where they bring attention to how you breath automatically and then suddenly you are very aware that you are now breathing manually. Same principle, only with a dash of fear thrown in.</p>

        <p>For the record - I'm not anxious about covid now.. but I was a nurse working in a hospital at the beginning of the "pandemic" and I was closely monitoring the situation in China. The propaganda got me at first and got me good for the first 8 months or so.. until I realised something sus was going on and I found you guys and r/conspiracy 💚</p>

        <p>So a covid “long hauler” here. Here’s what I understand through what I’ve learned about long covid. </p>
<p>Many “long haulers” including myself are suffering from a disease called Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(CFS). Its a disease that they don’t understand how it is caused or what in the body exactly changes that makes this happen. This is because it has been very much ignored by the NIH and the medical community in general despite the fact that this disease has always existed. CFS has been triggered by viruses such as lyme and the flu even before covid existed. It also has been triggered by vaccines.</p>
<p>It’s an awful disease, sparing the details of the symptoms, Im 24, and am too incapacitated to even leave my house sometimes. Was previously pretty healthy. </p>
<p>As someone who recognizes that vaccines are very important for keeping the general population from getting sick and dying, there really needs to be studies into who is at risk for CFS. Because people are literally developing CFS from the vaccine and other vaccines, and from Covid. Not everyone should get a vaccine because the risk of getting CFS is real, but we have no idea who shouldn’t and is at risk of developing CFS in the first place because no one has given a damn to figure it out.</p>

        <p>This sub really confuses me sometimes. We link videos of scientists and doctors warning about the unknown long term effects of the vaccine but then we want to deny covid can do the same thing as if the vaccine isn't just creating the same spike proteins from covid.</p>
<p>I'm not going to go scour the internet for data but I would imagine long haul covid doesn't have a lot of data because most doctors have no fucking clue what they're doing and just treat anything they don't recognize as anxiety and prescribe an SSRI. </p>
<p>When the spike protein from covid or from the vaccine causes blood clots in the lungs and kills someone (yes its rare), that's technically permanent lung damage lol. Why wouldn't it make sense that it could also cause permanent damage and not kill you? Same shit with the heart. </p>
<p>You can acknowledge these things exist and also acknowledge that covid is completely overblown, especially since there is so much coming out now about treatment with zinc ionophore cocktails thats very effective. Something like 85% of the deaths attributed to covid could've been prevented if they allowed doctors to actually treat the virus or taught them how to.</p>

        <p>I've only seen that data from the CDC that say's it's more likely with COVID-19 than other respiratory illnesses.  </p>
<p>But, I too am curious about how common this sort of thing actually is and the actual severity and prognosis.</p>
<p>I agree that people will point to corner cases like, "marathon runner has permanent lung damage from COVID."  That could theoretically happen with a lot of things.  </p>

        <p>I don't think it's too far reached to assume the possibility of long term effects, especially since it's probably non-naturally occuring and manufactured. The problem with it though is that the damage could be systemic and difficult to quantify. Similar to Lyme which has seen decades of continual discrediting and has only recently been seeing more recognition. Which also happens to have a rumored history of originating as a biological weapon.</p>

        <p>since you deleted the other post, have it again.
I'm gonna give you an anecdote anyway, long covid is a thing. My mom got covid past year where she was in the hospital (due to poor diet and overweight), 1 year later she still coughs frequentely. There may be some type of permanent lung damage because ever since she got covid shes not been able to hold her breath properly and gets tired very quickly, she's only 50 too.</p>

        <p>yes of course it can cause permanent damage, this is just logic. If it can kill you because of organ damage, it can also cause permanent issues assuming you survive some significant damage to organs.</p>
<p>In your mother's case she might want to seek treatment from a competent doctor. I think it is possible that those same treatments for early stage covid might help with long haul symptoms (ivermectin etc), but i'm not a doctor, so this is something you have to look into.</p>
