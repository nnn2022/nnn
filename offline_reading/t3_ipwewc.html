    <strong>Harassment from pro-lockdown redditors - have you received it and what can be done?</strong>
    <p><p>For the second time now I’ve had an unhinged pro-lockdowner going through literally all of my posts after I’ve made a case against lockdown (including those in subreddits entirely unrelated) to downvote, report and/or write some insult or “look at their post history - they deny COVID“ or “they are against lockdown” . There are few protections from this form of harassment. There is no way to hide my account from them so as to prevent them from stalking all future posts. The reddit team is often biased and allows their threats/harassment. Does anybody else here deal with this?</p></p>
