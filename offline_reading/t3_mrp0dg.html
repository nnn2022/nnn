    <strong>mRNA Info from a Chemical Engineer</strong>
    <p><p>I am a Chemical Engineer, but I know enough biology to be dangerous.  I thought this info on mRNA and how it is used/created in the body might be useful.  I will do my best to answer any questions but if you want more detail than this I might have to dust off my old biology textbooks.</p>
<p>mRNA stands for messenger ribonucleic acid. It is very similar to DNA but mRNA only has 1 strand. This is useful because of its main use in the body which I will outline below. However, it is also not very stable and gets broken down fairly quickly by the body.</p>
<p>The main purpose of mRNA in the body is to act as a go-between for our DNA in the nucleus and the expression of genes as proteins.  I used <a href="https://i.imgur.com/xqwnSdm.jpg">this picture</a> to help me remember the process better (it is the same picture posted here). But, you could follow along with almost any diagram from google or biology textbooks.  The process is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The DNA is split open inside the nucleus</li>
<li>A single strand of DNA (1/2) is used as the original and a set of protiens builds a matching strand of mRNA</li>
<li>This strand of mRNA exits the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm of the cell (this is just a fancy word for being inside the cell but outside the nucleus)</li>
<li>In the cytoplasm are two other key materials for this process the first is tRNA</li>
<li>Each tRNA has 3 nucleotides and carries a specific kind of amino acid</li>
<li>nucleotides are the building blocks of RNA and DNA</li>
<li>amino acids are the building blocks of proteins</li>
<li>An enzyme called Ribosome facilitates the matching of mRNA with tRNA</li>
<li>from here the amino acid that the tRNA was carrying is added to the chain of amino acids, then it is expelled from the system to get another amino acid</li>
<li>The ribosome follows along the mRNA using tRNA to build the protein one amino acid at a time until it reaches the end of the mRNA</li>
<li>From there the ribosome detaches from the mRNA and the mRNA is broken down so its parts can be used again</li>
<li>At the same time the amino acid chain folds into shape and becomes a proper 3D protein ready to be used by the body</li>
</ol>
<p>Now a bit about the vaccine and how it uses mRNA. The goal of every vaccine is to put some semblance of a disease into our body so it can learn to fight it. It's like giving our cells a training dummy so it knows how to fight in the future. In previous vaccines this has been accomplished by injecting a dead, weakened, or altered version of the disease. However, it takes a long time to create a dead, weakened, or altered version of the virus that is safe to inject in people. This is where the covid vaccine starts to differ. The researchers had the idea of what if we only give the body a crucial part of the disease instead of the whole thing? The body could still develop crucial immunity, but there wouldn't be the risk of ineffectively modifying or killing a living virus. This was the key to the speed. They used previous research on mRNA Vaccines to start working on one for Covid-19: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1690918/">The idea was started with tests on lab mice in the 1990's</a>, but the modern technology was spearheaded <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/10/the-story-of-mrna-how-a-once-dismissed-idea-became-a-leading-technology-in-the-covid-vaccine-race/">started in 1995 by Katalin Kariko</a>. In 2012 several mRNA drugs were being developed but none had been created yet. In 2018 BioNTech started to pivot from drugs to vaccines.</p>
<p>The crucial protein targeted for covid-19: the spike protein that the virus uses to attack/attach to our cells. The vaccine injects you with the mRNA coded for just the spike protein. As a result, your body starts to recognise and attack the protein. So, the Covid-19 vaccines make your cells create their own training dummies to practice on.</p>
<p>However, mRNA is fairly unstable like I said before. In order to even get the mRNA into your cells the mRNA needs to be encased in fat(oil) bubbles. Think about the way oil forms bubbles in water then shrink them down so much that you can't see them. That is where the mRNA is. The fat bubbles act like envelopes protecting the mRNA until the bubble is broken down inside the cell's Cytoplasm. From here the mRNA from the vaccine is in the same place as the mRNA from the cell's nucleus. So, the cell uses it to build the spike protein then it is degraded just like all mRNA in the cytoplasm.</p>
<p>The amount of vaccine and the number of doses is determined by how much mRNA is needed to create enough spike protein to elicit create an immune response and train the body. The storage conditions are determined by differences in how protected the mRNA is.</p></p>

        <p>which is completely unnecessary. and it only "trains" the cell to fight off  what ever it is programed to fight off... virus mutation is fast. so you would have to keep getting injected over and over... because this mRNA triggers an auto immune response.. so get a new jab for each and every "variant" ahaha . no thanks I would rather not take billy boy gates not a vaccine. I will let my natural immune system deal with this</p>

        <p>The variant scare is just a false scare tactic.  The variants actually vary less than .03% between each other.  It is such a small difference that your immune system would still fight the variants the same as the original.  </p>
<p>This info is from a Pfizer head I saw today.  I will try to post the actual video he made.  The crux of his talk is that variants are not variant enough to warrant any response from our government.  It's just a false scare.</p>

        <p>It is unknown exactly what is changing.  However, since vaccine immune response is not affected much, I would assume that the spike protein either isn't changing or is barely changing at all.</p>

        <p>thanks for the explanation. my criticism of mRNA vaxs is that you're in essence running a closed source app on your body. sure that might be a fine risk on a computer with out any banking details or compromising info but your body should be treated with far more respect to security. if they start licensing mRNA like free software I might consider taking it.</p>

        <p>Agreed, though at some point you do have to start trusting the testing and procedures that are being done. Emergency authorization wouldn’t be given out for no reason. Especially when the vaccine is “free” to all who want it. It’s not really free the government and health insurance agencies are paying for it but it is free to the people getting the shot. Why would the government pay lots of money to increase an already bad deficit if the cost wasn’t worth it.</p>

<p>yes, and this point is when the vax is open sourced under a license meant for free software so I can guaranty what I am putting into my body and what effect it will have on me. this is the minimum slandered for digital hygiene, it should be the same for something <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrovirus">potentially dna altering</a>.</p>
<p>&rt; Why would the government pay lots of money to increase an already bad deficit if the cost wasn’t worth it. </p>
<p>because this is a republic and in a republic you win power by promising the masses free stuff in the and pay for it with their future prosperity so you can blame any economic problems on your opponent when they come in power. like come on man, this would be highschool government if teachers and politicians hadn't decided to propagandize you on the glories of republicanism for 12+ years.</p>

        <p>No version of COVID or its cousin SARS show up on that wikipedia article you linked to.  Also that's how viruses work and reproduce in general.  All viruses inject their genetic material into cells and then hijack the cells to make more virus (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_replication">Source</a>).  </p>
<p><a href="https://stanmed.stanford.edu/2020issue2/how-coronavirus-destroys-cells-treatments.html">"SARS-CoV-2’s genome is made of RNA"</a>  This means that genetic material from Covid-19 is stored in RNA and thus cannot be permanently bound or incorporated into your DNA.  I also have learned that covid-19 and SARS-CoV-2 are essentially the same thing.  So, I have some corrections and apologies to make about one or two of my comments.</p>
<p>There are 435 members of the house of representatives + 100 senators.  With the exception of some super hardcore conservatives, most of these government employees have gotten the vaccine and recommend it to their constituents.  75% of congress has received the vaccine, only 23% of the US population has been vaccinated.  If this was really some big power grab wouldn't a larger number of people be saying that this is just a political power grab and be refusing the vaccine?  Even Donald Trump did a tremendous amount of work with operation warp speed to get the US capacity to produce vaccine up and he was vaccinated himself.  Then Biden takes the torch and runs with it crushing his goal of 100,000,000 vaccines in 100 days so hard that he doubled it to 200,000,000 vaccines in 100 days.  I just have a hard believing that this is just a big power grab when most of both sides support it.</p>

        <p>I made a mistake in the comment that I mentioned to you.  I thought that SARS-CoV-2 was an older version/variant of COVID-19. When I did some research for a newer comment I found out that I was wrong and that the two terms are essentially the same. The best I saw it explained was that SARS-CoV-2 is the name for the virus itself while COVID-19 is the name of the disease it causes. Similar to how HIV is a virus that causes a disease known as AIDS. (COVID and AIDS are only similar in naming conventions). So, I am sorry and did not mean to mislead anyone. However, my original point of Pathogenic Priming only being technically possible and not having any direct evidence still stands.</p>

        <p>My reply to u/Expensive_Ordinary_7 actually has some info on some of this.  The issue is: if there is a "human" protein that is similar enough to the spike protein, does the body get confused and attack both?  After some light research, the best I can say is that it may be possible but there hasn't been any evidence of it yet.  My gut tells me it's unlikely, but I've found that it is usually best to listen to research/experts over my gut (Especially when it's something I am not an expert in, like Biology)</p>

        <p>Haha ChemE here as well. I know even less than you, only getting a one day crash course from a student presentation and my own reading on tissue regeneration but came to the same conclusion.</p>

        <p>It sounds like the antibodies produced by an mrna vaccine will suck ass if they only are seeing a single protein of the virus.  As soon as the virus mutates that protein you're left with a bunch of shitty antibodies.  I'll take my chances with my natural immunity or maybe a live or inactivated type vaccine as soon as anybody gets around to isolating the virus.</p>

        <p>Actually, the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-55642648">Chinese Vaccine</a> uses dead Covid-19 cells to build the immunity and it was recently found to be about 50% effective at preventing all illness.  However, keep in mind that vaccine efficacy needs to be taken with a huge grain of salt when trying to compare different vaccines.  The reason for this is that most of these vaccines were tested in different conditions: Pfizer and Moderna were tested in Europe and North America near and just barely dipped into some of the big spikes in cases.  J&amp;J was tested mostly in Brazil almost entirely during a huge spike in cases and at a time when the more contagious UK Variant was starting to become prevalent there.  So it is hard to fully compare the 90%'s of Pfizer and moderna to the 66% J&amp;J to the 50% Chinese vaccine.  It does seem like a bit of hit when China original claimed efficacy in the 70-80% range.</p>
<p>Also, you have to keep in mind that the spike protein is what the virus uses to attack your cells.  If you can disarm the virus by blocking or destroying the spike protein then your cells won't get infected.  The mRNA vaccines is like taking the ammo out of your enemies gun before they can shoot you with it.  The enemy is still around, but now they are helpless and will get a proper beatdown for trying to mess with you.  (I hope that made sense, I am trying to be fun and creative with some of my explanations/views)</p>

        <p>Still doesn't change the fact people are having to take an experimental vaccine for a virus with a 99+% survival rate. Especially since after vaccination, you are still "required" to follow the same rules as before....
If more people took their health more serious with exercise and proper nutrition, then that 99+% could be significantly higher. But Americans are inherently lazy and refuse to take any personal accountability for most of their life choices. We live in an instant gratification society where it is easier to take the experimental vaccine, then do the right thing and take care of your body the right way as best you can. Sure you'll have genetics and acts of fate but it's undeniable that most of the country would be in a better way if the "magic box" (television) preached more on proper nutrition, exercise, mental and physical health tactics, rather then pharm companies pushing meds for illnesses most people wouldn't have if they took better care of themselves. </p>
<p>This Country ultimately needs less quick fixes, less laziness, more awareness.
All that can only come from incorruptible leadership, proper education and schooling. 
We need a revamp of American Culture to save our society not just from physical death, but mental and emotional death as well.</p>

        <p>I agree with some of what you are saying and I think America is making slow progress.  I took some food science classes in college and there have been some regulatory changes to make added sugars way more transparent.  There has also been a push to show nutrition facts both "as is" and "as prepared".  This keeps the sugary cereals from looking as healthy.  So, I'm hopeful.</p>
<p>I'm not quite as pessimistic when it comes to thinking all Americans are fat and lazy.  I think there is an issue of healthy food not being cheap or accessible to everyone.  Some people are forced to eat the way they do. </p>
<p>I am a pretty healthy young guy and I still got the vaccine.  It's possible that I could do everything right and could still end up getting Covid.  I also don't think the vaccine is as experimental or dangerous as some people believe (If I thought it was dangerous I would not have gotten it).  Why not get the vaccine and then I can let myself be a little loose with some of the covid rules.</p>
<p>I also agree that restrictions should be loosened for vaccinated individuals to promote vaccinations.  However, it is hard to do that without also promoting vaccine cards / passports.  I'm not 100% sold on that idea because I think people should not be blocked 100% by things if they aren't vaccinated (There are legitimate reasons for not vaccinating like allergic reactions).  </p>
<p>As far as the 99% survival rate there are a few ways that can be measured/looked at:</p>
<p>1) Deaths/cases = 565,000 / 31,500,000 = 1.79% of people who get it survive</p>
<p>2) Deaths/population = 0.17% of the US has died from covid</p>
<p>Both of these measurements are important, but they measure different things.  1 is the death rate of the disease, as close as we can get it.  Because it can be hard to know for sure who has covid (Asymptomatic) it can be hard to perfectly calculate the number of cases in the US.  However, there is some statistics that mathematicians can do based of testing centers to find good enough approximations.  </p>
<p>The second number is much more concrete and represents your chances of both getting the virus and dying of it.  An important thing to know with this one is that if lockdowns and masks work this number would be low.  At the beginning of all of this, the experts were saying "If we do everything right, it will look like we overreacted."  The US has also been lucky in that most of our cities never had overflowing hospital systems (LA suffered for a few weeks but that's all I heard from the news I watch.)  And, the longer the this disease spreads the larger the second number will get.</p>
<p>For Italy 1) = 3.04% case mortality and 2) 0.19% of their population died.  And this is a European country with modern accessible healthcare.  If we reliable data from poorer countries that also were unable to lock down or enforce masks you can see how these number would go up again.</p>
