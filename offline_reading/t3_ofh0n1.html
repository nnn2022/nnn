    <strong>Studies showing the effectiveness of facemask</strong>
    <p><p>Hi everyone, </p>
<p>As we know, any scientific studies that challenge the narrative are often censored-</p>
<p>Does anybody have some linked studies that show the efficacy of face masks against viral transmission of the flu- I mean the covid?</p></p>

        <p>I think the thing to look at is actually asymptomatic spread.... where was THAT proven to happen?? That's the only reason they have for making healthy people wear a mask .... because you could have it and be spreading it without knowing it oooooooOOOOooo...</p>

N95-masked health-care workers (HCW) were significantly more likely to experience headaches. Face mask use in HCW was not demonstrated to provide benefit in terms of cold symptoms or getting colds.</p>

None of the studies reviewed showed a benefit from wearing a mask, in either HCW or community members in households (H). See summary Tables 1 and 2 therein.</p>

“There were 17 eligible studies. … None of the studies established a conclusive relationship between mask/respirator use and protection against influenza infection.”</p>
<p>Smith, J.D. et al. (2016) “Effectiveness of N95 respirators versus surgical masks in protecting health care workers from acute respiratory infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis,” CMAJ Mar 2016 https://www.cmaj.ca/content/188/8/567
“We identified six clinical studies … . In the meta-analysis of the clinical studies, we found no significant difference between N95 respirators and surgical masks in associated risk of (a) laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, (b) influenza-like illness, or (c) reported work-place absenteeism.”</p>

“Self-reported assessment of clinical outcomes was prone to bias. Evidence of a protective effect of masks or respirators against verified respiratory infection (VRI) was not statistically significant”</p>

“Among 2862 randomized participants, 2371 completed the study and accounted for 5180 HCW-seasons. ... Among outpatient health care personnel, N95 respirators vs medical masks as worn by participants in this trial resulted in no significant difference in the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza.”</p>
<p>Long, Y. et al. (2020) “Effectiveness of N95 respirators versus surgical masks against influenza: A systematic review and meta-analysis,” J Evid Based Med. 2020; 1- 9. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jebm.12381
“A total of six RCTs involving 9,171 participants were included. There were no statistically significant differences in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza, laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections, laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, and influenza-like illness using N95 respirators and surgical masks. Meta-analysis indicated a protective effect of N95 respirators against laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonization (RR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.43-0.78). The use of N95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza.”</p>

        <p>No study needed. Facts about efficacy of surgical masks is well known and for a long time.</p>
<p>Everything else is just lies and twisting facts.</p>
<h1>Masks block droplets and splashes, not "highly contagious airborne killer virus variants"</h1>
<p><strong><em>"Surgical masks are not designed or certified to prevent the inhalation of small airborne contaminants.</em></strong> <em>These particles are not visible to the naked eye but may still be capable of causing infection."</em></p>
<p>"<strong><em>Respirators are designed to reduce a worker’s exposure to airborne contaminants.</em></strong> </p>
<p><em>Respirators come in various sizes and must be individually selected to fit the wearer’s face and to provide a tight seal. A proper seal between the user’s face and the respirator forces inhaled air to be pulled through the respirator’s filter material and not through gaps between the face and respirator"</em></p>

        <p>Just a few studies about mask efficacy for those inquiring minds:</p>
<p>Over 3 times the risk of contracting influenza like illness if cloth mask is used

<p>I’m adding more “mask drop” info to read (Brit):</p>
<p>Mask wearing drop 👇🏼</p>
<p>"This study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution against the use of cloth masks. This is an important finding to inform occupational health and safety. Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection. Further research is needed to inform the widespread use of cloth masks globally. However, as a precautionary measure, cloth masks should not be recommended for HCWs, particularly in high-risk situations, and guidelines need to be updated.”</p>

<p>Cloth masks can increase infection </p>
<p>https://www.who.int/publications-detail/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak
From the WHO: There is limited evidence that wearing a medical mask by healthy individuals in the households or among contacts of a sick patient, or among attendees of mass gatherings may be beneficial as a preventive measure.14-23 However, there is currently no evidence that wearing a mask (whether medical or other types) by healthy persons in the wider community setting, including universal community masking, can prevent them from infection with respiratory viruses, including COVID-19.</p>
<p>Masks- </p>
<p>Prolonged wearing of the surgical mask causes loss of intellect potential and cognitive performance due to a decrease in blood oxygen and subsequent brain hypoxia. Note - some changes may be irreversible.</p>
<p>"Report on surgical mask induced deoxygenation during major surgery" https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18500410
"Seventy percent of the patients showed a reduction in partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), and 19% developed various degrees of hypoxemia. Wearing an N95 mask significantly reduced the PaO2 level"
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15340662</p>
<p>"Wearing N95 masks results in hypooxygenemia and hypercapnia which reduce working efficiency and the ability to make correct decision."
...
"Medical staff are at increased risk of getting 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome' (SARS), and wearing N95 masks is highly recommended by experts worldwide. However, dizziness, headache, and short of breath are commonly experienced by the medical staff wearing N95 masks. The ability to make correct decision may be hampered, too."</p>

updated to find information on cloth mask particle filtration.  I did also include a review from 1967 on all the studies about development of masks that is a fascinating read.  It is important to read the whole thing if you start. If you just read the first page you will be differently informed than reading the whole thing (it's short!)</p>

<p>Cloth masks worse than surgical masks for anything &lt;2.5 uM: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27531371</p>
<p>What kills things on masks?
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29855107: yes: bleach, UVC,autoclave, TERC   no: UVA, alcohol
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29678452: UVGI is a yes
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25806411 UVGI works, and mask still good, but much more fragile (90% more)

<p>History of surgical masks: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5333967
This paper was actually a great read. Basically walks up to the invention of plastic masks with filters. You can’t get a fabric mask wet, and it’s much less effective without a lining (in the citation they were using packed cotton as the best lining)</p>
<p>The take home wrt cloth masks stopping viral particles of ~120 nm or cough particles less than 1 um:</p>
<p>Distribution of particle sizes in a cough maxes out at ~9</p>
<p>Distribution of particle sizes in a cough maxes out at ~900 nm: https://bmcpulmmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2466-12-11
Most particles under 1 um:  Fabian P, Mcdevitt JJ, Dehaan WH et al. (2008)  Influenza virus in human exhaled breath: an observational study.</p>
<p>Cloth masks not very efficient with small particles (in some cases negligible filtering):
https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577.full: Laboratory tests showed the penetration of particles through the cloth masks to be very high (97%) compared with medical masks (44%) (used in trial) and 3M 9320 N95 (&lt;0.01%), 3M Vflex 9105 N95 (0.1%).</p>
<p>Highly recommend reading this one- particle size breakdown and fabric differences for cloth masks and particle penetration: https://doi.org/10.1093/annhyg/meq044</p>
<p>Cloth masks worse than surgical masks for anything &lt;2.5 uM (** the one brand had a filter, and was the best performing cloth mask): https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27531371</p>
<hr>
<p>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0843-2</p>
<p>In conclusion, both surgical and cotton masks seem to be ineffective in preventing the dissemination of SARS–CoV-2 from the coughs of patients with COVID-19 to the environment and external mask surface.</p>
