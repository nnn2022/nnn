        <p>There are SO many that show how they don't work, but my favorite has to be Fauci himself. </p>

        <p>Your source does not in any way suggest that masks cause secondary infection. It is a study of the Spanish flu. I’m not sure but I don’t think the public wore mask back then.</p>

        <p>Its 3 am where I am so I'm fading.
Here are two studies that correlate masks with bacterial infections.

        <p>Those two studies have nothing to do with COVID. Number 1) they invest age bacteria, but that’s not really an issue, there is a much bigger problem. Number 2) the survey investigates bacteria in an OR environment, aka. The spread of bacteria during a surgery, and it was looking at whether or not guidance should be updated as to how often surgeons change their masks, with the fear that bacteria could possibly accumulate there over the course of a long surgery, where the surgeons are continually exposed to bacteria.</p>
<p>Number 3) The study’s conclusion in and off itself counters your point. It concludes that the increase in bacteria over time is not caused by the environment, but is simply bacteria from the person themself which accumulated over time - viruses don’t do the same might I add - and as such is not harmful, and only encourages safe disposal techniques for surgeries longer than 2 hours.</p>

        <p>I think that's precisely the point you're glossing over - bacterial overgrowth in masks is what people are dealing with by wearing masks all day at work, and not washing them/reusing them long term. This is part of stupidity that governments could be educating people about but don't.</p>
<p>The other part of the conversation revolves around how incredibly easy it is to spread virus pathogens simply due to the fact people fuck with their masks all day, touch door knobs, fidget, shove it in their pocket, back in the face etc.</p>

        <p>I'll just copy my comment from the pinned post in case any one missed it:</p>
<p>In case any of you were wondering where to find studies showing the opposite of what this BS study claims, here's 33 studies for why masks don't work: https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/o28j4o/scientific_proof_masks_dont_work_and_cause_harm/</p>
<p>btw disregard the long comment of "summaries" that the shill u / mimimi- put. They aren't "summaries" but rather they are twisting the articles' words to appear like they're pro-mask. That user is also most likely the culprit of many of the organized shill attacks on NNN.</p>
<p>edit: Jesus Christ the shills keep talking about how the second article was retracted and using that as a strawman to say ALL of the articles are wrong so f<em>ck that I'm just removing that article and now you sheep have nothing to b</em>tch about :)</p>

        <p>Hey just FYI for anyone wanting to participate in this, keep in mind that it's already well-established that masks don't really work for influenza, but many studies show that they did appear to have an effect on SARS in the early 2000s. If you want to poke holes in the idea of mask mandates, the way to do it IMO is focus on studies relating to SARS, as it is a similar virus, has a large selection of studies available, and occurred long before covid and therefore isn't tainted by the current political climate.</p>
<p>Look for studies that explain how the protective effect sharply falls or disappears entirely when masks are used incorrectly, as they largely have been by the general public this past year. I think that's the best approach. 👍</p>

        <p>Ah not at the moment, sorry. I'm just on my phone and it would take forever to relocate and link them. I'll try later on my desktop if I get the chance.</p>
<p>The gist of it though was that masks did confer some protective effect but it depended a lot on the type of mask (with N95 or higher being substantially better than a regular surgical mask), whether or not they were reused (reusing cotton masks without heavy duty washing and sanitation eliminated the protection), how often they were worn, the snugness of the fit, whether they were used in conjunction with other preventative measures like hand washing, and several other factors. In other words, you might get some mileage out of them in a healthcare setting, if you know what you're doing, but otherwise it's likely just wasted effort.</p>
<p>This was all pretty well known at the start of covid and lines up with Fauci's (surprisingly) accurate and measured assessment of the issue back in April or whenever it was. He said that it's not recommended that the general public bother with masks because they wouldn't manage it well enough to have much of an effect, and could potentially make it worse when people inevitably fiddle with and contaminate them. That's basically what I've concluded on my own, as well.</p>

        <p>There just aren't any peer-reviewed scientific sources that definitively show that masks do, or don't, work to inhibit COVID-19 spread. No one's done an official study on it yet. </p>
<p>The only data that is really examinable is comparable infection rates between mask mandate areas vs. areas with no mask mandates, in similar population densities, with similar climates, and there's not really any clear correlation there.</p>
<p>You can compare N. Dakota vs. South Dakota, or Florida vs. California, and several other examples, and it goes both ways. </p>
<p>When you look at that data, the total efficacy of masks is barely negligible, if anything at all.</p>

        <p>I doubt the mask wearing behavior difference between mask mandates areas vs no mask mandates areas are statistically significant enough to reach any conclusion. There's just too much variation from other factors. No conclusion does not equal no effect though.</p>
<p>EDIT: After some search, there does appear to be research claiming a correlation between COVID infection rate and mask adherence.</p>

        <p>Shouldn't there be, though?</p>
<p>If masks were effective, shouldn't the infection rates where masks were required be at the very least measurably lower than places that have no mask mandates?</p>
<p>I mean, Mexico had a really high mask usage and a lot of mask mandates, and it didn't seem to help them very much.</p>

        <p>China has very almost universal mask usage during the beginning of the pandemic, and they quickly got it under control. My point is, there are so many other variables that trying to predict pandemic severity of a country using their mask policy is essentially pointless.</p>

        <p>Firstly, we can toss China right out as a reliable metric for anything. The CCP has been extremely dishonest with the rest of the world, so taking anything that they claim at face value is highly foolish. </p>
<p>Secondly, it's not about prediction, it's about the year's worth of data we've collected, and that data shows no measurable correlation between mask usage and infection rates. </p>
<p>The thing is, after all this data, we SHOULD be seeing at least SOME reduction in infection rates based on mask usage and mandates, and the numbers simply don't support that.</p>

        <p>Where are you getting your numbers?  Anderson pooper?  Your numbers are fraudulent</p>
<p>A) Pcr test isnt reliable, critical thinkers knew this day 1.  Watch some kary mullis interviews he invented the test and goes on for days about how the cdc stole his test for fraud.  To raise money for itself and the nih.  Back in the 80s and ever since.</p>
<p>You have swallowed the propaganda hook line and sinker and you are now demonstrating to the elite that you are a liability to civil society.</p>
<p>Your sith bullying logic or anti logic wont work here bud.  Think for 2 seconds about what you know and how you know what you know.  Its not your fault for being a victim but if u continue to be gullible and driven by fear of the boogeyman you will be culled.  If u think your handlers want droids you are mistaken, you will be separated with the droids and culled.  Spars 2025.  You are referred to as useless eaters.  This is a psyop to sift you out and be rid of you.  Dont fall for clown show.  </p>
<p>B) they openly admit they count anything as a covid death if they are unsure.  Inflating numbers to anything they want.  And you spout these numbers like they mean something</p>
<p>Flu deaths vanished to zero.</p>
<p>If you really dig(and i realized you are not trained as a researcher but just try just a little and you might realize how much bs you are buying here.  You bought a lemon and present it like a diamond cut mercedes.  </p>
<p>C) dont be naive this is the largest psy op ever, supported by viewers like you</p>
<p>D) i’ll kindly fuck off from bozo town, enjoy your bozo village.</p>
