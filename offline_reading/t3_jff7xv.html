        <p>Look, I touted the Sweden herd immunity thing a lot as that fit my natural response at the start of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it ripped through their elderly much worse than any flu. The only reason they could keep up was the excellent state of their resources and health system. </p>
<p>Most of us are getting worked up over misinformation from the states. And that’s because they don’t provide quality healthcare for their citizens and very poor and disjointed leadership. Their outcome was inevitable at this point.</p>
<p>It’s time to stop obsessing over the country that we used to look up to before we grew up. </p>
<p>It is a world leader that can’t even take care of its own. </p>
<p>I have no doubt that the corrupt legislature of the US is riddled with competing conspiracies. It’s fucking ripe for it.</p>

        <p>Not you.  You're either paranoid of the common cold or you just like doing anything your government tells you to do.  It's as if you're afraid to have a thought of your own.

        <p>So you think all the countries and all the health professionals are lying? All the millions of people  involved? 
I have scant regard for corona, but I find it difficult to live in a fear state. It’s a worse end than a flu though.
The nurses I know have had really shitty experiences with this. One near to me that’s running a ward privately talks about having to choose who gets the ventilators. Longer shifts, not enough staff and equipment. She stays off the internet because she can’t deal with the ignorance of naysayers.</p>

        <p>I work in a hospital.  I've gone to work Monday thru Friday every week all year.  My hospital sat empty when the media claimed hospitals were overrun.  All the hospitals in the neighboring counties were ghost towns just like my own.  Nurses and staff were laid off.  Who closes down hospitals during a pandemic?  We had to turn away "Elective Surgeries" so we could keep the beds empty for all of the Covid patients that didn't exist.   Hospitals went bankrupt during that time.  The solution?  Give hospitals money for all covid patients who died covid deaths.  So of course hospitals lied!  </p>
<p>Essential workers didn't die from this.  We're all fine.  We all went to work every day, socialized for 8 hours, served the public, and went home.  Every single day.  And none of us died.  Grocery store cashiers, retail workers, stockers, gas station attendants, hospital workers, Amazon workers, everyone!  We all went outside, drove to work, chatted and mingled with coworkers and customers, went home to families, and were absolutely fine.</p>
<p>Admit it- if this was as deadly as the media claimed, all essential workers would have dropped like flies.  Stores would have shut down due to too many employee deaths.  Hospitals would have been overrun treating all of the essential workers who were suddenly sick.  </p>
<p>But none of that happened!   Like it or not, you were lied to.</p>

        <p>Mate. That’s America. I haven’t come across the empty hospital stories from anywhere else. Since when are hospitals EVER empty?</p>
<p>Not in countries with free health care. Easy, fast access without being manipulated by different payment schemes in each state.</p>
<p>If I was in your country, in your job, having your conversations, I have no doubt I would hold your views.</p>
<p>Instead I have a friend that talks about the trauma of choosing who gets the ventilators. </p>
<p>Medical care has advanced to where the people have longer lives, especially where universal health care is a thing. Society advances in progressive countries. 
Even in Qld where our response has been effective, we still have two doctors getting COVID though.</p>
<p>Now I don’t give a shit about SARS and would let it burn through, especially once I learned that children have lower susceptibility. But luckily cunts like me are not in charge. I want to protect my grandmother and mum and give them a fighting chance so I have no problem wearing a mask. It’s inconvenient and uncomfortable depending on the brand, but I’m a big boy now.</p>
<p>The thing is, I’ve found a new job and am working. A lot of people are NOT adaptable or used to the job struggle. Some of them may be overdosing, beating their spouses, or hanging from a rafter. Sucks to be them.</p>
<p>I would find a way to earn no matter what restrictions are in place. But our government has given generous support to job seekers during this pandemic!</p>
<p>You guys don’t have that. That is a massive failure of your country.</p>
<p>So in America’s case no. 45 has so hamstrung any hope of a response, it feels like you’d be better off lifting restrictions and getting on with it, ppl are dying either way.</p>
<p>I guess the point I’m making is that your experience is not being shared by progressive countries. Instead you have ridiculous word artists decrying every progressive idea as “socialism” and ignoring the long term success of proper, thorough, instantly accessible support for all.</p>

        <p>I told you.  "elective surgeries" were not allowed- THAT is why hospitals were empty.  No Covid patients and those people who were not immediately dying were not allowed to go to the hospital.  I don't know how else to explain it to you.  Believe it or not- that's your call.</p>
<p>Old people died from this.  Old people got pneumonia and needed vents.  Not healthy young people.  Influenza killed more young people than covid did.  This virus has a very high survival rate if you're young.</p>
<p>Age: 0-19 Survival Rate: 99.997
Age: 20-49 Survival Rate: 99.98</p>
<p>Influenza kills more than that according to the CDC.  This virus kills the elderly who are already sick and bed ridden.  And we have never shut down because of that.  So no, I don't believe your friend if he's saying that young and healthy people are dying on ventilators.  It just doesn't happen or there would have been no essential workers and we would have all starved to death if the virus didn't kill us.  </p>
<p>And stop accusing America of being all fucked up.  You live in Australia.  They've locked up Melbourne so fucking tight that they are arrested and put in prison for leaving their homes.  So don't fucking put your shit on us.  We have states rights which means that we can move to any state if we don't like the one we're in.  Not all of our states are trying to keep people out of work.  Michigan, my state, just took our governor to court and got her orders dropped so we could go back to living our lives.  The court straight up took away her virus powers.  Can't say the same for any court in your fucked up continent.  I've been to Australia twice, but after seeing how badly your governments are handling this fake as shit, I'll never be going back.</p>
<p>Yeah, your government is giving precious handouts to people sitting at home doing no work- a great system that's doomed to fail.  Your little tiny island in the ocean has no financial support to match that kind of system and your entire economy will collapse very soon- so enjoy that!  We'll survive this mess, but your entire population is learning how to depend on government permission just to put food on the table.  You may want to rethink your position on this.</p>
<p>I work for my money and we took our governor to court to cut away her powers to keep us in lock down- and if we hadn't?  Well, we could simply move to one of the many states that aren't still locked down.  Courts all over America are winning against the few corrupt governors.  It's changing here.  I'm free while you beg your leaders for table scraps.</p>

        <p>Yea, I didn’t say the young are on ventilators. I said the young are relatively safe from ‘rona.</p>
<p>We’re in agreement about the immunity of youth. </p>
<p>I don’t think $1200 a week is table scraps. We have a well managed economy that has surplus to support job seekers. It’s been nearly the whole year but I’m sure they’ll drop the payments back soon. 
Side note: most people continue to work.
A lot of our wealth comes from mining, luckily international tourism is being replaced by local tourism now. </p>
<p>Your general assertions about Oz are off the mark.</p>
<p>Do you believe the World Health Organisation? At all?</p>
<p>World mortality rates for COVID are 3-4%.
Mortality rates for influenza are 0.1%, but mortality is mostly affected by access to and quality of healthcare. </p>

        <p>The WHO said in March that there was no danger from this virus whatsoever.  So yeah.  Believe them if you want, but I find them to be complete liars.<br>
And how can you say that you believe that the virus cannot kill young people and then ask me why I don't believe that the virus is dangerous when the WHO says it is?  You keep saying two different things because you're unable to actually stick with an original point.</p>

        <p>Viruses are pretty magical. I’ve had mucous on the lung for 3 months now. Apparently the same virus overloading me twice in a row. I have no doubts the right one will come along one day to overwhelm us. The rona has the magical qualities of fast transmission and slow incubation, if those properties are ever combined in a more lethal virus, it’ll burn through us, apart from the countries that lock down and manage infection rates.</p>
<p>It sounds like you’ve taken the impressions a lot of us formed at the beginning of the pandemic and decided consistency is more important than accepting new information as it develops and is supported by data.</p>

        <p>This. There’s high demand for talented and passionate programmers and software engineers. If you were talented and passionate about that field, you’d have been doing it before the government told you you needed to. Nobody wants or needs a mediocre coding bootcamp grad who only learned to code because he ran out of options. They can outsource that crap to a foreign country for 1/4 or less of the salary any American would expect.</p>

        <p>Yeah right. Also giving up your normal life by the way contributed in some way to decimate hundreds of small businesses and livelihoods that depended on such "normal life", so you save someone's life and you also end up destroying others including maybe your own, what a predicament huh?</p>

        <p>I really hate when people talk about "privilege," but imagine how privileged you have to be to write off all the terrible second-order effects so condescendingly. Sure, it's worth it for <em>her</em>, because all the last seven months have been to her are an excuse to stay home, have food delivered, and watch Netflix. These people don't have to worry about their kids' educations, terrible home environments, or job loss (yet).</p>
<p>It's even more hypocritical considering she seems to view herself as "woke."</p>

        <p>An acquaintance of mine reposted this on Instagram (guess it’s making the social media rounds) and not as a joke, they are aggressively pro-lockdown. I immediately unfriended them as this statement is so clueless it’s deranged. Should have unfriended them a while ago anyway.

        <p>You know, it is profitable keeping someone alive for a few months or years. Why shouldn't we keep a human alive for as long as posible. But seriously, it's sick to make a profit out of elderly ppl just to drain the last dollar/euro/etc out of him/her. Why can't ppl see that beeing selfish (and keep a human beeing alive as long as posible) is the worst thing to do to honor. And yes, my grandma died a few years ago from cancer. I let her go, we let her go. It's the right thing to do. Death is a part in our lives, everthing ends. Except for this ridiculus fear about this "killer virus".</p>
