    <strong>New normal means no fun?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m sure I’m not the only one who thinks this. </p>
<p>Call me “selfish” if you must, but the worst part of this whole thing is how we just have to slog along and exist even as we’re “allowed” to do things. </p>
<p>I find it hard to keep positive even as things in my county reopen. The things I can look forward to seem few and far between, and the boost I get from going out only seems to last a few days. I’ve done volunteer work. I’ve been able to eat in at restaurants and see family again, make some plans with friends coming up. And yet, everything still feels like something is lacking. I’m not sure if it’s the absence of baseball season (and my second job being MIA along with it). I don’t know if it’s because I’m avoiding Mass because masks and social distancing are required, and we can’t worship and gather like we should be able to. Or maybe I just miss the social interaction and buzz of the office. I just don’t feel as enthusiastic for life like I used to. </p>
<p>If this is the new normal of no more crowds, no more church the way it should happen, no more sports, and capacity limits in businesses, and everything being done in the name of “safety”, then it feels so miserable. And I keep saying comments on and off Reddit that say “we need to be patient a little while longer,” “People need to just follow the rules” and “It’s not about you.” I’ve already given up a lot for nearly four months and it’s wearing on me yet I’m expected to continue to be sacrificial and “go with the flow” because “the virus doesn’t go away because you’re bored.” It feels like everyone around me is so adjusted to this and accepts it. Yet I can’t get myself to come around.</p></p>

        <p>That’s the point, having fun is important to the human psyche, it’s what keeps an individual grounded, boredom breaks people down over time.</p>

        <p>It won't even be the boredom that breaks people into protesting and revolt. It will be that the government tanked the economy over a virus that has a low mortality rate. People need to get back to work.</p>

        <p>Disagree. The only reason why large peaceful protests have any impact at all is precisely because of the parallel violent protests. The message to politicians is loud and clear: "Wowwee those violent rioters sure are dangerous. Now my friends and I here are peaceful <em>for now</em> but they're real mad and I don't know how long they'll stay peaceful so you should probably just do what they want because there's an awful lot of them and once they all get mad I won't be able to keep them peaceful"</p>
<p>See also: there are <em>millions</em> of people who peacefully protest abortion every year. I went to a protest in my city (just to see what it was like) and there were 15,000 people here alone. The likelihood of abortion laws changing in this country in any meaningful way is basically zero. Why? Because they're peaceful</p>

        <p>No. The people of today are spineless and pathetic. Even people like us haven’t done shit. People are either brainwashed into liking this or are too scared to rise up. Only we can change that, but will we? It’s up to you to decide whether to die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.</p>

        <p>I wish I could reach across the screen and give you a hug. I feel exactly the same. I was recently shot down because I mentioned I would miss the Oscars if they were cancelled. Next March!! Movies are a huge part of my life and I was made to feel selfish for even voicing my sadness. I miss my very active social life so much. I went to see a movie almost every week with a friend before Covid. We still have our Horror Movie night at her house though. Life seems... I can’t describe it, like a grey wishy washy kind of existence?? Joy isn’t allowed any more is it.!  I am a huge tennis fan. I miss my tennis!! The US Open is going ahead... with no fans!! WTF!  Part of the fun is it’s 2 am in the morning in New York. Fans are still there. Juiced up on beer. Heckling. It just won’t be the same without the fans. I have been called selfish. A granny killer. Only thinking of myself. Well. I am thinking of myself. My job has literally disappeared. I just had to take in a roomie which I didn’t want to do but. Fuck. This all sucks. And many. Actually, very many, of my friends who I thought would be so anti lockdown etc have completely become terrified of even going out.! So. I feel for you. And completely empathize.</p>

<p>I’m sorry about your job. It amazes me how the governors/prime ministers can deem so many people non essential and kick them out of work, then show they can’t even handle paying them. (Overloaded unemployment systems.) I get this was unprecedented, but maybe they should have put limitations on businesses in the first place instead of closing for three months.</p>

        <p>Really, they should never have closed or put limitations on businesses in the first place.  Rather, let the businesses adapt while allowing continuity of operations.  They have caused far more damage by shutting so many businesses down - essentially choosing winners and losers - than the virus could have ever done.</p>

        <p>I’m a big movie fan too so I get this completely. I’m miserable all day every day because literally everything  I do outside of my house for fun is gone until at least 2021 and I’m hearing a ton of “until there’s a vaccine.” So, if this miracle shot never comes into existence, we aren’t supposed to go to concerts, live theater, travel on a plane, etc? That’s not a life I have any interest in living. Plus, I live alone so this whole “no one outside of your household thing” is truly unsustainable for me and anyone else in that position. Mental health isn’t considered in this at all. I one time commented on the twitter feed of the governor of my state (Ohio) about taking mental health into consideration and within no time at all, I got a response about how that isn’t as important as “staying home to protect my (the person who replied) 80 year old mother. Never claimed to want to kill the elderly. Honestly, physical health really isn’t either because people are terrified to go to a health care facility. I hate to say or think this but the amount of deaths caused by this lockdown I expect will be staggering.</p>

        <p>I definitely think it’s interesting that he tends to open things up after a lawsuit is filed. If it really is too dangerous to open, the lawsuits shouldn’t matter and you should double down on your reasons as to why you are staying closed. Yet, at least twice so far, a lawsuit was filed and he announced reopening permission the next day.</p>

        <p>I love movies as well, so seeing movie theaters in danger of closing down permanently, and seeing the ridiculous restrictions the government will try and enforce on filmmakers really saddens me. </p>
<p>I'm pretty active in a lot of fandom servers on discord, usually those are places for me to talk about tv shows, movies, and comics with people who also love them, but the Covid 19 Hysteria is seeping into these environments now. I left a server because someone linked a tweet that said "stay the fuck home", and honestly it angered me so much I left the server.  I didn't say goodbye, I just left.</p>
<p>I'm at the point now where I can't really tolerate this anymore.  Seeing people just wallowing in their own misery and demanding that others do the same, being self righteous if people don't want to, and trying to constantly shove their shit in my face... I'm done. Just done. If I see that now, I will just leave for the sake of my mental health.</p>

        <p>everything that makes society worth being a part of has been taken away or destroyed. no gyms, no bars, no clubs, no live music, no sports, no religious gatherings, no addict anonymous meetings, no group therapy, no community centers, no schools, etc... and the economy is in the shitter. its such a shame that authoritarian politicians have destroyed everyone's quality of life. these assholes need to be brought to justice.</p>

        <p>I like your comparison to the temperance movement. It gives me hope that sane people will start underground movements to live happy lives, that people will realize their policies which were meant to help are actually hurting people, and then eventually this will all be repealed and we‘ll have good lives again :)</p>

        <p>I agree.  I believe in quality of life and not living a life ruled by fear.  I travel, and I miss it so much.  Had countries not locked down, I would have happily followed through on travel plans in late April - right when many places supposedly peaked.</p>
<p>With stuff opening up a bit, I make it a point to go to the gym and dine out regularly.  Even if I have a weekend day where I feel a little lazy - nope, I'm out because I know how quickly that shit can be taken away from me.</p>
<p>The most maddening thing of all of this is that we took away people's ability to decide on the risks they take.  More than that, we did all of this without batting an eye at real risks that the lockdowns exacerbated - people can eat, drink, and smoke themselves to death, but god forbid I should hop on a plane and go somewhere when I am a healthy sound minded individual.</p>

Being single and living alone certainly didn’t help the feelings of despair and loneliness. People need other people, locking us up just hurt like hell.</p>

        <p>Yes. Baseball being missing. That’s a huge factor. As well as all the masks and capacity limits like you mentioned. </p>
<p>I’m with you, it does feel like the spirit of summer is gone sadly, people aren’t going and walking around as much and having fun like they were last summer. There’s nothing wrong with you at all for thinking this way, all we can and should be doing is combatting the fear mongering with as much objective data and points as to how this lockdown was unnecessary.</p>

<p>That sucks about your festival, I’m sorry to hear that. It’s saddening how so much stuff is shutting down at the drop of a hat. Not only events but also restaurants, stores and bars because they can’t stay open.</p>

        <p>I prefer to go out with just my spouse in quiet ways, I don’t need to have parties or big dinners, except with family, and I don’t like crowds.  I can spend a lot of time happily at home.  There were a few very specific obligations it was a relief to be free from, but, it wasn’t how I wanted it to go down.  Even with all this, that never meant I want everything to shut down.   I have a sense of comfort from life and worship and entertainment happening.   My husband and I would go to at most one game a season, but there is something about everyone watching the game together even if it’s just tv and even if we are just us in the house; we still know everyone is experiencing it right now.  </p>
<p>I don’t love crowds but I tolerate them for a great concert, but it’s still nice that concerts are happening generally.  </p>
<p>There’s something comforting about life going on even if you’re inside.   I saw two ads for movies coming out in theaters the other day.   They were ads in a YouTube video.   Without realizing it I let them play through and got a surge of happiness.  They weren’t even movies I would see, but I didn’t realize until after that having life open up again was inspiring me.  I do like movie theaters since the crowds are quiet and you can get into it.  </p>
<p>I’d normally click out of those ads as fast as I could and roll my eyes at Hollywood’s constant intrusion.  I couldn’t believe that I’d be so happy to see some cheesy trailers.   </p>
<p>I miss going to church too but even in days I don’t go it’s reassuring that everyone is.  </p>
<p>This is freedom I care about.  </p>
<p>There’s something deeply psychologically disorienting and upsetting when you know that just nothing is happening out in the world.  </p>
<p>It is like the feeling when you were a kid, of falling asleep in your room while you hear your parents talking and doing the dishes downstairs.     You didn’t want to join them doing dishes or anything, but it was comforting to know they were up and watching over you and that life was happening around you.  Which made it easier to fall asleep. </p>
<p>What’s happened now with everything stopping  is like the child went to bed and is lying awake, but instead of hearing their parents staying home chatting and laughing, the child hears them leave the house with no explanation, and is now lying awake in bed alone with no babysitter and no idea when the parents are coming back.</p>
<p>For a very brief moment, I admit as an introvert I felt a sense of vindication that extroverts were understanding how stressed and out of my element I feel most of the time when I used to be forced to be more social at jobs and so forth (I have since arranged my life so I do not have to do that, but it was always hard for people to morally judge me for not enjoying it at the time.). However that was in a specific context and it was only brief, and it certainly was not something that meant I was happy about the lockdown at all, because the truth is that being forced to be locked down long term is not good for anyone, introvert or extroverts.</p>

        <p>Very relatable. Thanks for giving me an opportunity to complain, lol... I didn't really want to complain too much, also because my country is partially re-opening and a lot of people all over the world still have it even worse.</p>
<p>We can go to a restaurant if we make a reservation and we can visit a live concert at limited capacity and again, if we make a reservation... but where's the joy in all this? I HATE life like this! Everything is becoming bland, meaningless, overly regulated, and I have nothing to look forward to. In September my education will start again but it'll likely be online every other week and when in the classroom, with all of us sitting far apart and with rules for every little movement.</p>
<p>I can't go to the gym. I miss just meeting up with my friend at the gym and getting some fun/exercise in. </p>
<p>There's no spontaneity in anything. Visiting a museum, going to a concert, seeing a movie, going to a restaurant, everything is difficult and regulated. Where's the fun in it? It's like they say ''yeah technically you can do stuff, but these rules are going to take all fun out of it so it becomes unenjoyable so there's no reason to go anyway''. </p>
<p>Work is difficult. What I enjoyed about my work was the people, and people meaning something for each other. People being able to freely move around and being <em>welcome.</em> But now, we have to police where people freaking <em>walk.</em> What door they go through! Where they freaking sit! If they disinfect their hands upon entry!! </p>
<p>It's absolutely maddening because I was there recently (still doing a lot from home) and the weather was nice so people wanted to go outside but they'd have to walk around the whole building to get in again (which nobody did) and it just really made me feel how utterly insane it is to police normal, basic human behavior like this. How invasive it is to police every little movement and action.</p>
<p>Working from home is very difficult and it sucks and I hate it.</p>
<p>I miss my friends, one I can't meet up with and I'm fed up with Skype, another is still deathly afraid of corona so she wants us to follow a ton of tedious rules. </p>
<p>Using public transport requires you to wear a stupid and suffocating mask. </p>
<p>I can't imagine how people tolerate or even enjoy this. I have nothing to look forward to, and the ''second wave'' doomerism  hangs over everything like a spectre waiting to take away the few things that we <em>do</em> have. I can't freaking <em>imagine</em> living the same un-social, un-fun quarantined misery for yet another 3-4 months. What if I just want to risk the damn virus if I can get my quality of life back?</p>

        <p>Life is being drained from life in order to prolong life.</p>
<p>As a person who was already battling trauma, mental health issues, and suicidal ideations, now being bullied into constantly fixating on myself and others as potential killer contagions is unsustainable for me. Life became so fraught with fear - of my support network vanishing, everything that bought me joy I have to be anxious when I do, fear of my business failing because no one wants to visit my shop - eventually I simply stop caring if I die.</p>

        <p>I'll give you the ultimate insult for those in the US. We are about to celebrate the anniversary of our independence from a tyrannical regime. In many places, people are forbidden (or at least discouraged) from gathering to celebrate that independence and freedom. The irony is not only glaring, it's sickening. And this isn't a political statement; freedom knows no party and never should.</p>
<p>And no disrespect to my friends in the UK. Actually, with the tyranny you're currently undergoing, maybe it's time for a little revolt of your own.</p>

        <p>Text wall incoming. I feel the same. </p>
<p>Technically I’m an introvert, although apparently not as much as I once thought based on how the world is currently going. I love writing, art, reading, programming/math/IT, watching cartoons, the Internet, video games, and playing music. All of these things can be done at home, alone. Technically. </p>
<p>But they’re not the only things that I love to do. I love getting out of the apartment and exploring the world around me, especially during the summertime, my favorite time of year. Amusement parks, water parks, carnivals, county fairs, and zoos are my lifeblood. Everything else gets put on the back burner during summer. I couldn’t imagine a life without them, and yet so many people still don’t have them, and I’m constantly afraid we’ll get them taken away again. I’m afraid that the theme park industry will tank just like it did during the Great Depression. </p>
<p>I love working out at the gym. I love just being outdoors: hiking, walking, kayaking, sitting in the shade. I’ve gone to church almost every Sunday since I was a baby — so my entire life — and I do not appreciate being told that I have to stop. I love going to the movie theater: playing at the arcade, getting some good unhealthy food, watching previews, and enjoying an awesome movie. I only go to sports games occasionally, but I do enjoy them and I hate that they have been taken away from us. Why should I be happy that other people have their joy taken away from them, without their consent?</p>
<p>All things considered, I’ve always thought that calling people selfish for having fun was kind of...pointless? I think the goal in life should be to be considerate and caring, not selfless and 100% altruistic. In other words, I think a moderate amount of selfishness is actually a good thing. If people never thought about their own needs, then they would never accept anyone else’s help, period, thus rendering the whole point of service futile. It is still important to love, help, and care about others, but your own needs and wants are <em>just as important</em> as that of others’. Thus, having fun and doing what makes you happy isn’t a luxury — it is vital. I hate when they say “it’s not about you” lol I should be able to do whatever I want. And if that makes me selfish, I straight up do not care. </p>
<p>Also when I do an activity I don’t really think “how can this benefit others?” I guess I’m just not that morally upstanding lol. I just think, “how can I have fun today, while still being productive, and do I want to invite anyone else to come with me?” I don’t do in-depth analyses of my pastimes. I don’t think about whether or not they’re for the greater good. I just do what I want, when I want to do it, simply because I want to. </p>
<p>Also, freedom and individual choice are supposed to be a thing, as much as people like to make fun of that. Even if going to amusement parks and county fairs was a 100% selfish activity that gave absolutely no benefit to anyone else (which is false: they provide employment and bring happiness to people) I should be able to do it anyway. I should not be forced to conform to someone else’s ideal. They are free to suggest it to me, and I am free to reject that suggestion as I see fit. Or at least, that is how it used to be.</p>

        <p>Turn the rhetoric on its head and argue that it is selfish to be overly preoccupied with one's own health at the expense of everything else. Great case in point is Giorgio Agamben, the great Italian philosopher. </p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@ddean3000/biosecurity-and-politics-giorgio-agamben-396f9ab3b6f4">Giorgio Agamben</a> has beautifully portrayed the dystopian society we are complicit in bringing forth through our dangerously excessive response to COVID-19: </p>
<p>&rt;...the total organization of the body of citizens in a way that strengthens maximum adherence to institutions of government, <strong>producing a sort of superlative good citizenship in which imposed obligations are presented as evidence of altruism and the citizen no longer has a right to health (health safety) but becomes juridically obliged to health (biosecurity)</strong>.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>&rt;It is legitimate to ask whether such a society can still be defined as human or whether the loss of sensible relations, of the face, of friendship, of love can be truly compensated for by an abstract and presumably completely fictitious health security.</p>
<p>One cannot help but appreciate his moral integrity and selflessness: demographically he is (very) old and male - two of the risk factors for COVID-19 severity - and yet he can see beyond self and is concerned with the broader questions of <em>what world we want to live in</em> and <em>what kind of life is worth living</em>.</p>

        <p>It feels that way to me, yeah. Fortunately, my county is really opening up, and people aren't scared here.</p>
<p>But I've heard people on r/movies and whatnot talk about the second wave all the time, indicating that they never wanna go back to a theater again until a vaccine. And then Disney requiring masks and lower crowds and stuff.</p>
<p>Most of the people advocating for extended lockdowns and business closures are well-off white people who have the likes of the internet, cable, streaming, video games, and takeout and don't desire to do anything else with their lives. For example, a lot of the Hollywood journalists on Twitter are just loving the lockdowns because they can binge Marvel, binge Star Wars, and play PS4 and Xbox One while cuddling their Baby Yoda plushy all they want without needing to worry about people scolding them for not going outside.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but just because you like sitting on your ass doing jack does not mean I want to as well. I'm also a fellow nerd who likes that sort of stuff, but I want to get my career started, find a cute girlfriend, explore nature, sustain my health, etc.</p>
