        <p>Of course, but many people out there are taking all of This as Gospel. They don't believe there's any other perspective or interpretation of what's going on. They don't realize this is an all-encompassing thing. They don't take the time to educate themselves and look at different sources.</p>

        <p>Definitely not. The worst thing I see is people are actually taking the MSM design for actual news and factual reporting, even when their ACTUAL personal experience disputes or disproves it by default. That is the scariest thing about this situation.</p>

        <p>Totally agree with you. None of this is a surprise, this is how we all ended up here. But many people honestly take the "news" as gospel. They live their lives by what they are told.</p>

        <p>This website analyzes the coverage stories get by conservative vs liberal media. It's all completely predictable but it's interesting to see it laid out like this. The story I linked is being ignored., the blind spot report is interesting too</p>

        <p>Did you read the study?  It's totally lockstep with the Doomer mentality.  Very pro-mask, and what it's really endorsing is that anti-social distancing should be enhanced.  It also self promotion for their app, which calculates space/time/#of people to to tell you how "safe" it is.</p>
<p>I don't think it's legit at all, seeing as how they take masks as "settled science."</p>

        <p>The engineering professor who authored the study actually said many places that have been and are shut down didn't and don't need to be. He said the distancing rules that have closed businesses are not reasonable and the emphasis on distancing has been misplaced since the beginning. He also said people should be provided with actual scientific facts not fear mongering. I am not hearing this on popular news outlets right now. That's pretty significant since we are being told we can't be near one another until we get vaccinated and even then we need to continue with masks and distancing.</p>

        <p>Yes, they are saying that places shouldn't be shut down, but that there is a limit to people x time permissible in a given space.  And that masks must be worn.</p>
<p>To me, that's an endorsement for some type of ongoing control, for which they conveniently have an app.</p>

        <p>I see what you're saying, for me saying businesses should not have been shut down and this was a misstep from the get-go is a pretty big deal. I'm guessing that's why this story is not being widely reported. That is not a popular thing to say. And the fact that in a lot of places churches and businesses are still being terrorized by the government and forced to stay closed, it's still going on in a lot of places. Also, now that you've got me thinking here it's funny how a report of virtually anything that goes against this narrative is not acknowledged. What you're saying about them supporting The Masks is something that you would think they would love. But that's not even enough to put the story in the news because it's going against closures which is what they still want in a lot of places. It's a very all-or-nothing thing.</p>

        <p>Yeah.  I think we will be waiting for a long time if we think that any politician or health authority, anywhere, will say publicly, "we were wrong."</p>
<p>I think you'll see some whistleblower books written in the years to come, but none of the main actors will come clean.  In a generation, when they are dead or out of power, there will probably be some sort of general understanding that all the control measures were bullshit, and that most of them did more harm than good.</p>
