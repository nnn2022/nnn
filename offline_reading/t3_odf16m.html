    <strong>What did the "experts" get right, from the beginning?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm serious, I can't really think of anything.  It started with the World Health Organization saying there was "no clear evidence" that the virus could spread between people.  Along the way we had things like claims surface transmission was a big risk factor.  Things like shutting down the parks.  You guys can think of other examples of things the "experts" got wrong, but what did they get right?  We are told things like 'as new information comes in, we adjust our recommendations' etc., which is fine and dandy, but they still got many things wrong.  But <em>now</em>, with the vaccine, we are to suppose it is 'right'.  And maybe it is.  I think it is likely very safe for most people, but why should anyone think so after all that 'they' have gotten wrong?</p>
<p>I'm not looking to argue, but if anyone can share a thing about this pandemic that the so-called experts have been right about all along I would very much like to hear about it.</p></p>

        <p>Respectfully, I disagree.  Not that she's an 'expert', but she <em>is</em> part of the propaganda to which you allude, but Nasty Pelosi initially encouraged people to go to Chinatown...... and I think it was Crying Chuck Schumer who said similar things.  And of course the entire Establishment of the U.S. called President Trump a racist for limiting travel from the infected area.</p>
<p>So even <em>that</em> was handled wrongly.</p>

        <p>Maybe I'm wrong but I think that was a brake check on people's ability to recognize this bullshit.</p>
<p>You know, when the "experts" tell you one thing one day, and the day after they tell you the <em>exact opposite</em>, that should create some level of cognitive dissonance in the population, right?</p>
<p>When it doesn't, like <em>it has happened</em>, then you know that doublethink will not be recognized as such, and you know you can push harder with it. Latest example of it would be <em>the vaccines are our way to get back to normal</em>/<em>the vaccines are not enough to go back to normal</em></p>

        <p>Well to play Devil's Advocate, at first surface transmission did appear to be a big risk factor because they found that in laboratory conditions, CoVid could stay active on surfaces for up to several weeks.</p>
<p>Then they finally did real world studies and found out "Nope, when CoVid dries out (which it would do quickly under non-controlled conditions) on hard surfaces and even soft surfaces it dies!"</p>

        <p>I remember a 6 year old (at the time) study demonstrating that in very specific laboratory conditions a (different) virus was able to live a long time in a freezer, and because of that every single shopping cart etc. was sprayed down with sanitizer religiously.  So, oops, it was a mistake I guess, it turned out that in the real world surface transmission isn't a risk.  I just hope there isn't an 'oops, it was a mistake' with the vaccine too.</p>
