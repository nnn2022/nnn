        <p>I draw parallels to how people have accepted this vaccine with open arms, full belief and total faith - no questions allowed. The science is already settled according to them (psst...science is never settled) and any questions instantly makes the asker a sinner.</p>

        <p>The same exact people who accept there was no voter fraud in the 2020. It’s crazy that you can literally see people in public and know almost everything about them as a person.</p>

        <p>The thought has crossed my mind more than once.
Makes me wonder if the vaccine has the potential to be the mark of the beast, but I think there are still too many people fighting against it for that to be realistic.</p>

        <p>It’s hard to know what to believe. I knew they’d have politicians getting vaccinated on tv to boost confidence. But I don’t believe they are really getting the vax. Just a syringe with saline water.  I trust Bill Gates about as much as Bill Cosby.  </p>
<p>For the side that ranted on and on about “my body, my choice” sure do want to tell us what to do with our bodies.</p>

        <p>Im not sure this will be the mark of the beast, but every move they make brings us one step closer to the main event, and this is not an exception.</p>
<p>Its going to keep getting worse. Pedophilia is around the corner, cannibalism will come/be peddled as most likely the solution to climate change.</p>

        <p>I was really interested in the Book of Revelations when I was younger. I was indoctrinated young and that Book was the only one that was like reading a horror novel. I read every one of those Left Behind books. But I stopped thinking it was real sometime in my late teens. I consider myself agnostic now. But I'll admit I'm starting to get a little worried that I was wrong.</p>

        <p>Read it and believe it. You see Babylon in chapter 13? That's referring to the USA. Every single president is just doing his own little bit to move the country closer to it's end. A few exceptions here and there i.e Trump, but we're pretty much at the end now, except Biden doesn't get into the white house.</p>
