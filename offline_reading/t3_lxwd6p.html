    <strong>Ontario, new to me info - Is David Fisman's modelling partner his wife?</strong>
    <p><p>So if you're on this sub and you live in Ontario, you've probably heard of David Fisman who is very active on Twitter as a pro lockdown member of the official Ontario Science Table. </p>
<p>I have also seen Fisman refer to and @ message on Twitter many times, his constant and ever present modelling partner, Ashleigh Tuite, of course, both from U of T.  I believe that the federal health Agency also uses modelling from them both. </p>
<p>I have now seen a few rumblings that this Ms Tuite is actually his wife.</p>
<p>Does anyone know the real story here? I'm a little shocked that even Fisman didn't disclose that his modelling partner has been his wife this whole time. Can someone you're in a relationship with really give you non biased feedback on your work??</p></p>

        <p>Maybe as part of COVID restrictions they don't allow people living at different adresses to work together? And that's why he had to work with his wife?</p>
<p>We all remember that Neil Ferguson, chief British COVID modeller was 'working on his modeling' extramaritally, and that didn't end up well for anyone.</p>
