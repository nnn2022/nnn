    <strong>Something to point out</strong>
    <p><p>Does anyone else find it weird how this sub has over 40k followers, and there always seems to be at least 1,000 to 2,000 people online each time? 800ish at the least.</p>
<p>Now, if you look at CovIdiots (the sub we all love), they have more than double the amount of subs we do and as of now, only 169 people online and it often stays around that range every time, 200 at the most. For a sub that's that big, that seems unlikely considering this site is generally left-leaning and Covid and mask talk seems to dominate social media at the moment so CovIdiots should be getting a lot of attention. Posts there from even three hours ago barely get any upvotes, maybe 3 or 5. Their subscriber growth is notably poor as well for it's size, I counted FOUR new subs in the space of about an hour. Whereas this sub, gets a good handful every hour and at least a couple hundred a day (which is great). Subs with an impressive 88,000 followers should be growing rapidly and have more active users because of the huge proportion of people.</p>
<p>It seems weird to me, and it wouldn't surprise me if a large portion of their subscribers are from bot accounts (there's probably some on ours too but not nearly as many). I could be very wrong and this could just be because of timezones, but what do you think?</p></p>

        <p>Maybe this is better for the conspiracy subreddit but I fully believe in Bots, until someone can prove this to me; </p>
<p>The Oscar YT channel has close to 2 million subscribers, I can sort of see why as they put the oscars on there every year but why subscribe to a channel that only posts ‚Äúgood‚Äù content annually, if you go there now you will see barely any of their videos gets views, and most of them have bad dislike to like ratios. </p>
<p>Now do the good part. Go to YouTube into The White House YT page. This channel gets some views but all of the videos, ALL of them get an abysmal level of likes with a ton of dislikes. On their bigger videos they‚Äôve even removed thousands of dislikes. Furthermore their channel only started after Biden was elected and somehow accumulated 1.9 million subscribers overnight, never gaining anymore after that.</p>
