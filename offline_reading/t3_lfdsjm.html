        <p>As a physician our view of the virus is skewed because we see the sickest of the sick.  We never see the millions who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms.  They don’t need our services. We see the guppies, people gasping for breath. In addition, we are the ones who have to tell the families and bear the brunt of their emotional distress. And it’s painful for us.  </p>
<p>It similar to car accidents.  Most car accidents are fender benders and your sore for a few days. But when you work in the trauma center, every car accident you see involves death or horrific injuries. Your view of what a car accident is becomes skewed.  You become a hard liner for car seats, air bags, and seat belt laws</p>

        <p>Doctors would also have seen the most severe  cases of influenza. Somehow they were able to put things in perspective though.</p>

        <p>I see tons of influenza in atypical year.  Influenza doesn’t scare me. I don’t see young people severely sick from it.  To me influenza and covid is the difference between a crash at 40 miles an hour and at 80. Most young people will be fine, but older people will suffer in a 40 mph crash.  At 80, everyone gets hurt.</p>

        <p>In my experience, though, people have been abnormally afraid to go to the doctor for non-severe illness/injury since march 2020 because of the covid propaganda: they're either afraid of getting covid from other patients, or giving covid to them. Flu was not socially stigmatized the way covid has been, did not have a "stay home or else" campaign attached to it. My guess is that you are getting a far more skewed view of how many covid cases are serious than of how many flu cases are serious, simply because of the media successfully instilling fear in people to the point where they're afraid to go to the doctor when they're sick.</p>

        <p>Pedestrians (non maskers in this analogy) can still be hit by cars but we don’t make walking illegal or immoral. You’re very right about seeing the worst of the worst because of the line of work but I don’t think that’s cause to change society so drastically. Especially because you admit to only seeing the worst, that could never be the whole picture. A medical professionals trauma should not be the world populations trauma. If you can’t handle it then perhaps a different line of work was in order? I do appreciate what medical professionals do but I mean, did you not sign up to tell families they have lost loved ones for an unlimited amount of possible reasons?</p>

        <p>I’m not sure where I said I couldn’t handle it. I have rough days.  We all do.  But yes, telling people that there loved one had died sucks.  If it didn’t suck; then I think it would be time to get a different job. I should care about my patients, I should fight for them. I wouldn’t trust a physician who didn’t care anymore. </p>
<p>I think your pedestrian analogy is useful.  Because we have rules of the road for pedestrians. We have crosswalks for them and we do make it illegal and fine them for not complying.</p>

        <p>Found another automobile analogy:</p>
<p>Everyone likes to compare masks to seatbelts but seatbelts keep 100% of your body in the car, while masks consistently allow 30 to 70% of the virus through. Imagine if seatbelts consistently allowed the top 30% of your body through the windshield, they would be useless.</p>
<p>Masks are more like turnsignals if someone slows down or comes to a stop in front of me and I rear-end them I didn't hit them because they did or didn't have a turn signal I hit them because I wasn't paying attention. If I am exposed to covid with or without a mask ill probably still get it and if I die its not because of my use its because I was weak or vulnerable or plain unlucky. I'll concede to using a mask in a doctors office and I value turn signals when at a busy 4way stop sign but when I'm kn the highway I don't put on my turn signal and expect everyone to make room so his highness can merge I rely on my mirrors and even turning my head if I'm not sure if there's a car in my blind spot.</p>

        <p>But... as a physician you should know that masks doesn't work for general population. It is actually quiet opposite . As a physician you see people dying , you see people suffer. It is part of the job and exactly the reason why I chose different profession.</p>

        <p>Medical professionals, like many other professionals, are afraid to “rock the boat” so to speak. If you stay quiet, you don’t risk being pestered by the state, which incidentally has complete control over medical licensure. You are correct the ones who have spoken out are incredibly brave. Many of them have lost their jobs or been shunned by the rest of the medical community.</p>
