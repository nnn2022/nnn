    <strong>Did getting covid19 change your opinion about what's happening?</strong>
    <p><p>Before I got it, I was pretty sure it's all way overblown and just being used as an excuse to push the new normal bullshit, but I still thought it was a pretty shitty disease.</p>
<p>Then I got covid and it was a weird cold. Nothing more. </p>
<p>Now I'm sure it's all a scam.</p></p>

        <p>But how do you know if you even got Covid? False positives and false negatives are off the charts. That’s where things go haywire about the whole Covid belief lmao</p>

        <p>No. It was a cold that felt like allergies and I never would have thought it to be anything else if this were any other year. </p>
<p>You should see the faces of people when I say I had it. “YOU <em>DIIIIID??!</em> yep, and I’m back to running and strength training and taking the stairs at work every day. They literally expect me to be some bloated corpse.</p>

        <p>Yes, it made me resent masks and lockdown even more. It was exactly the same as the flu (honestly i've had worse experiences with the normal flu)</p>

        <p>I got it and I still have side effects. 
I’m really on the fence with all the information floating around. 
Both sides have compelling cases . No pun intended .</p>
<p>Here’s the only thing that bothers me. My dad , he has lost 15 friends this year to Covid and I get it . It’s the whole dying “with Covid” thing 
But the thing is they suffered really bad for a long while . 
15 people in his circle? 
In a normal year plenty get the flu but this was extreme. 
I mean. They died .
My cousins father in law spent two months in the hospital -his lungs collapsed.
Being in Arizona and close to Mexico some were able to buy and rent ventilators from Mexico .
They were lucky . 
Again. Extreme.</p>
<p>So for me , being on the fence . I really do think it’s the flu.
Yes.
But it’s a strain that’s pretty hard to fight FOR *SOME PEOPLE. 
Others can have it and it does nothing. 
Me? I still have altered taste and smell almost a year later .
Boyfriend got it, good to go in mere days . My son as well and he was fine after a week . 
It’s really shitty for me though. I got it a lot harder and I never fall ill. I had it for two months and I felt like utter death. </p>
<p>My love of food is just gone . It all makes me gag now. 
I’ve tried the upside down thing with saline and all the remedies posted. Not giving up but there’s zero change .
Plus I have a chronic sinus infection which really sucks  .
I’m working on it still. </p>
<p>I just feel I’ll stay here on the fence . 
And watch and listen , try to process facts from both sides. </p>
<p>I do appreciate questioning what’s happening and not just swallowing the proverbial pill just because it’s handed to you. 
I just can’t ignore what I’ve seen either . </p>
<p>If I had to come to conclusion on the spot? 
We’re being f’d with. It’s a test run. 
It seems way too calculated and controlled . </p>
<p>Just thought I’d give insight on what other people are thinking. 
Not everything is black and white .</p>

        <p>My kid got it. It was less than a cold for him. He barely noticed anything different. And he said to me "wow, I thought it was going to be a lot worse". And then the rest of us didn't catch it despite following zero precautions for ten days.</p>

        <p>Are you sure you tested positive? My grandma tested positive but my grandpa tested negative. They obviously sleep together, eat every meal together, and are not farther than 15 feet throughout their entire day. </p>
<p>So either the testing accurate or this isn’t nearly as contagious as people say.</p>

        <p>Don't know. I absolutely refuse to participate in this bullshit so I never got any kind of test. Been sick with a cold a couple of times last year, but that was fairly standard, I catch a cold or two every year.</p>

        <p>I had it, ill for a week, ridiculous fever for a few days, lots of fatigue etc.. I stayed in bed and rested up for a week and was fine by day 6/7.  </p>
<p>Looking back on it, I was VERY stressed and some other stuff going on, so I'm not surprised I had such a strong case of it. And can definitely appreciate for someone less healthy or with an underlying condition it could spell trouble for them.  </p>
<p>Overwhelmingly, people have little to no symptoms such as yourself.  </p>
<p>Personally, I've always been in favour of targeted (opt in/out) protection for those in vulnerable groups. But for everyone to be constrained by the response to a virus with such a low mortality rate - is absolutely bonkers.   </p>
<p>I don't think the virus itself is a scam, but the response certainly is.... we are expected to believe - here in the UK after years of austerity and well over 100k deaths due to harsh measures to reduce the national deficit (it didn't achieve that in the end anyway), that suddenly our government flips a 180 and is so SO concerned for our health the financial ramifications don't even matter.  </p>
<p>Something is waaay off... that's for sure :/</p>
