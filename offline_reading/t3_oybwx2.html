    <strong>Serious Question: What is Happening?</strong>
    <p><p>I can't make sense of the events of the last 18 months.</p>
<p>If I'd been in a car crash and woke up from a coma like in <em>28 Days Later</em>, I'd literally think I was in the lead-up to the apocalypse, a new holocaust, or watching the Twilight Zone on repeat 24/7. This isn't hyperbole. I'm genuinely so baffled as an objective person to wake up and realize the reality of today would have been considered an absolutely ridiculous and unfounded 'conspiracy theory' two years ago. The stuff of science fiction.</p>
<p><em>What the hell happened?</em> A few things I genuinely don't understand and would appreciate ANY insight whatsoever:</p>
<p><strong>Frontline healthcare workers were heroes when they were unvaccinated, but now they're being fired for being unvaccinated</strong></p>
<p><strong>We (in America) were initially told not to wear masks because they were ineffective, then shamed into wearing masks, then told we didn't have to wear them if we were vaccinated, then Fauci's leaked emails said masks were useless, and now we all have to wear masks again vaccinated or not (and somehow that's the unvaccinated's fault)</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Two weeks to stop the spread" essentially became "We will continue this lockdown and eradication of civil liberties until we have destroyed the virus and all its mutations"</strong></p>
<p><strong>The very definition of 'herd immunity' was literally redefined by the WHO to state we can only get it via mass vaccinations, not by contracting the live virus and building antibodies as has been the case for all of human history</strong></p>
<p><strong>Vaccine passports were once a conspiracy theory and anyone who thought they would happen were conspiracy theorists; now, you're a conspiracy theorist for not supporting them</strong></p>
<p><strong>BLM protests in which millions gathered across America didn't cause CVD upticks, while anti-mask and anti-lockdown protests did—ironically, 66% of black Americans have not been vaccinated, and now they are being blocked from attending concerts, restaurants, bars, etc. as they (and the rest of the unvaccinated) are being cast as dangerous carriers of disease (where have we heard that before?)</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Delta variant was originally called the 'India' variant and has been around since before vaccinations even began (according to a UK study, it's also 19 times less deadly than CVD-19, which has a 99.97% recovery rate) but the unvaccinated are being blamed as the source of this 'new' mutation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The unvaccinated are supposedly the problem, but the CDC just released a study showing 3/4 of CVD patients in Cape Cod were vaccinated</strong></p>
<p><strong>Some months ago, the CDC stopped counting CVD 'breakthrough' cases \^ unless the patient went to the hospital and/or died (while docs across the US have reported that even in such cases, they were asked not to report it)</strong></p>
<p><strong>The controversial PCR test, which has been the de facto testing mechanism for CVD throughout the pandemic, is being recalled by the fall due to its ineffectiveness at identifying JUST CVD rather than ALL coronaviruses</strong></p>
<p><strong>Almost all of the healthcare companies front running the vaccines have had the biggest lawsuit payouts in the history of lawsuits</strong></p>
<p><strong>70% herd immunity to stop the spread has now gone to 80+% (wtf?)</strong></p>
<p><strong>The largest wealth transfer in history occurred, as our own tax dollars were (again) given to mega corporations to keep them afloat (and they didn't need to pay it back) while 40% of small businesses across the country went bankrupt and closed forever</strong></p>
<p><strong>Anyone who even</strong> <strong><em>questions</em></strong> <strong>the 'science' is immediately ostracized and made out to be a conspiracy theorist, Trump supporter, QAnon follower, Rightist, racist, or all of the above in order to immediately discredit the person and prevent open discussion (this is constantly reinforced by the unending censorship of questions and opposing opinions on social media)</strong></p>
<p>The list goes on. I'm literally baffled and genuinely afraid—not of the virus, but of all the people calling for the segregation (and even death) of the unvaccinated.</p>
<p>I wake up every day feeling like I can no longer make sense of the world. The 'authorities' are constantly changing definitions, narratives, and moving goalposts, and I see insane posts by regular people calling for the violent deaths of those who don't want to be injected with an emergency authorized, experimental vaccine by mega corporations with extremely dubious pasts (btw, it's a type of 'vaccine' whose original test patients—animals—all died when coming into contact with the live virus). Even though the vaccinated are now proven to contract the virus as well, even more so than the unvaccinated, the latter are being treated like bio terrorists. If you get the vaccine, aren't you protected? I'm reading reports of people being fired from work for being unvaccinated because vaccinated coworkers caught the virus; how does this make any sense?!</p>
<p>It seems as if people are suffering from mass psychosis or mass hypnosis (or both). How do intelligent, forward thinking people literally not see the truth in front of their own eyes? How do they go from 2+2=4 to 2+2=whatever we're told it equals?</p>
<p>Last bit—a story—I took my partner to meet my godparents. Both my actual parents are actually very messed up people, so I was excited to show her these intelligent, kind, fun, amazing human beings who I've cherished all my life. They kept coming back to the 'vaccine debate' and the virus, citing news headlines, not data. The night ended with an hourlong argument directed at me for not having yet received the vaccine, and I calmly explained why I was waiting, citing numerous articles and plenty of data and research which I've obsessively gathered for 18 months. My godfather said he was genuinely "shocked that someone as intelligent as you can't be logical about this," and my godmother, hearing we were about to go to Europe on vacation to visit my family over there, looked at my partner who they had JUST met and said coldly, "I hope you're okay with sitting outside in the rain" because I can't go into restaurants. And throughout the whole time they kept cornering my girlfriend and saying, "Are YOU okay with this? How do YOU feel about him not being vaccinated?" These people who I've known all my life and NEVER gotten into an argument with before—these people who love the shit out of me—turned on me on a dime and even tried to solicit the help of my girlfriend to attack and discredit me, all because I wasn't getting the vaccine like they had, which was none of their business in the first place. </p>
<p>I left that dinner feeling completely demoralized and alone. Questioning whether I can ever go back to see them again.</p>
<p>My last question: is this our future?</p></p>

        <p>Ok i’ll be honest I skimmed some of this because I know i feel exactly the same way, but it’s meant to be exhausting. Mask on, mask off, arbitrary restrictions, senseless rules, get vaxxed, wait it’s not as effective, but still get it... etc. you get my point. it’s meant to break you down</p>

        <p>this.</p>
<p>solution: stop watching news or consuming social media</p>
<p>only go to very selected yt channels and subreddits</p>
<p>problem: this could radicalize you, maybe in a bad way</p>
<p>maybe stop media all together for few months.. only old dvds and texting, calling.</p>
<p>move to a place like lil town in florida where " covid mandates" are non existant or ignored or illegalized. set a good example and stay open minded</p>
<p>these are just my 2 cents</p>

<p>I've mostly stopped reading the news—what I do now every day is check the top headlines on Drudge Report, which gives me a sense of the mainstream perception and where we're heading. Maybe even that is too much, I'm just trying to stay informed so I know what's happening.</p>
<p>Thought about moving to FL. I have friends there.</p>

        <p>Thanks for saying that. It's nice to know I'm not batshit insane, but some days I'm meant to feel that way.</p>
<p>The worst part of it all is in my final paragraph. When your own family turn against you, that's when you know something is wrong. And this is far from an isolated event.</p>

        <p>OP: It's <em>not</em> supposed to make sense, but <em>it</em> is supposed to be exhausting and demoralizing so that you will submit to whatever it is the powers that be have in store for you. Namely, their totalitarian, neo-feudal Great Reset.</p>
<p>Why? Because you (and all of us) are and have been living under a literal psychological operation for the past eighteen months. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_operations_(United_States)">Psychological operations</a> as in what you apply to an enemy population in wartime to make them submit to you.

        <p>What is happening? A very succesful try by rich people to make bussiness. </p>
<p>What happens when we all lockdown? Bussiness will close rather soon than later. People will lose houses, properties, and the price of those properties will go down as nobody have the money to buy these, but rich people</p>
<p>What happens when we all mask up? The fear and idea that we are in a “crisis” is normalized in the people, in order to accelerate the process of the previous point</p>
<p>What happens when we all vaccinate? Big pharma can make huge profit while making us sick so we buy more of their stuff, and eventually kill us to achieve the Great Reset </p>
<p>What happens when we all accept the vax paspport? Again, fear is used to keep us thinking this coronashit is a big deal to accelerate the previous processes, and make more people take the vaccine. Unvaccinated people are seem like the ones stopping people to get their freedom back</p>
<p>What do they want to happen? A controlled state where the government own literally everything. Population is reduced so they can enjoy driving without any traffic and the bad stuff that comes from “overpopulation”.

        <p>The veil of satanic control over this world is finally but gradually being lifted.</p>
<p>You could see it happening this last century and last decade especially,  but the last two years it has really accelerated.</p>

<p>Many of you reading this might not believe in God or faith, but as things keep getting crazier you might want to look up biblical prophecy because it's going to get harder and harder to rationalise away.</p>
<p>The usual motives of money, power etc. are part of it but by themselves they simply don't explain the extent of depravity and hatred for humanity in their actions.</p>

        <p>I agree with you to a point, and it is clear that the US Government agencies are implicated, but why are people in countries so far <em>not</em> implicated angry? I am in the UK and at the moment I am not aware of any links  from my country to GOF work in the US or China so you would think that people would be at least somewhat miffed, but not a dicky bird.

<p>Censorship, fines, lockdowns, restrictions, threats to those who don't comply, sanitary terror, forcing people to do certain things, inducing fear, selective "science", changing definitions to fit their narrative, etc. All of it because of a virus that "killed" 0.05% of world's population in 18 months. There are many things that may pose a threat to our health but for some reason governments and media around the world try very hard to make this virus special. Why? I don't know, but to me it's obvious - it's not about the virus.</p>

        <p>The reason some (turns out most) people go to 2 + 2 = "experts say" is because of one simple thing. Fear. That's entirely it. They buy into the fear. </p>
<p>In an odd way, I feel like they are conditioned to fear, and expect and almost crave it. Like they want to see doom, and pandemonium, and crisis. They cheer it forward and present any new fearful headline of the day as a fresh cup of coffee.</p>
<p>The really interesting part, is they only like abstract fear. Like an earthquake overseas. Something that doesn't impact them directly, but they can latch onto. </p>
<p>When the fear comes into real life, it turns into virtue. "How can I show I'm aware of the fear?" Masks? Stay at home? OK, no problem, "I'm a solution". Get a vaccine from a pharmaceutical company with a shady track record? No problem, done, and can I get flair to show others I'm "good"?</p>
<p>It's like the kids who thrived on getting gold stars on homework reports for validation, turned to social media for new validation. "I know we should be scared, I'm scared too, but how can I show I'm scared", and also a gold star winner because authority said I should be sacred. I'm doing what I'm told so I'm the good guy, right? </p>
<p>It's giant babies grown into adults who lack any independent thought. They crave to be told what to do, regardless of who says it or if it's actually beneficial.</p>
<p>I guarantee you that if Fauci went on MSNBC and told the nation that if you stick a raw carrot up your asshole, you'll be helping us all... fucking Twitter would blown up with buttholes with carrots in them.</p>
<p>Unreal.</p>
