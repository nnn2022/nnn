    <strong>RE: The 4 BA airline pilots who died.</strong>
    <p><p>I was looking for more information and found this fAcT chECk which I think begs more questions....</p>
<p>https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2021/06/fact-check-four-british-airways-pilots-did-not-die-in-a-week-and-there-is-no-proof-deaths-were-from-covid-19-vaccine.html</p>
<p>The author claims that it isn't true that they died within a week of each other because 2 happened in May and 1 in June.......well that could still be within a 7 day period.  Not that it matters but it's suspicious to argue it couldn't be the case when most certainly there are a few 7 day periods that could take place in both May and June.</p>
<p>Anyway, next they talk about how one of the pilots was hospitalized back in Dec for nearly a year with coViD.  Well if he was vaccinated that goes with some theories that I've heard that if you have recovered from covid and also take the prick you can have a pretty bad reaction.  So another non-fact fact check.</p>
<p>Next you have a male in his 30's found unconscious and pronounced dead on the side of a mountain bike trail??  That sounds very suspicious to me.  Now they mention that there might have been internal bleeding from possibly hitting the handlebars.  That is very unlikely to render someone immediately unconscious.  Though a bleeding disorder or a bleed made worse by the vaccine is certainly possible.</p>
<p>Also they mention that BA hasn't yet mandated vaccines.  This is another one of those half-truths.  No, they haven't threatened to fire anyone yet but they have incentivized monetarily and there's also the idea that you might not be able to take the high paying international flights because of the restrictions in different countries so....</p>
<p>I'm not saying that they are related to the vaccine but I am saying that at this point we need to QUESTION EVERYTHING TWICE and from multiple angles.</p></p>

        <p>I agree there's something fishy about this. The fact it's considered necessary to have been fact-checked only lends more creedence to the story.</p>
<p>Unless there's a plane crash, how often would it occur for four employees of an airline to suddenly drop dead? Even if it was within a month instead of a week or maybe even an entire year, it most certainly seems out-of-the-ordinary. Anyone wanting to convince me it's unrelated needs to at least admit it's an unusual anomaly instead of debunking a timespan of a week, which seems like semantics to me.</p>

        <p>Most people don't realize the PHYSICAL, medical and mental tests that airline pilots are subjected to on a monthly basis.  If it were 4 tarmac workers it might not be as suspicious but 4 airline pilots - it's very suspicious.</p>

        <p>Just a comment on fact checking in general.  If you were to fact check in (mainstream) media and official reports you would find that not one single person has died from complications of vaccination.  So "no proof" is just a general negation.</p>

        <p>This was from my daily Robinhood email about the markets.  I found the part about the lack of pilots interesting to say the least....</p>
<p>Airlines' Comeback: complete with cancellations, delays, and rising fares</p>
<p>&rt;It's a party in the TSA... The number of people passing through US airport checkpoints is back to 75% of 2019 levels, the highest since pre-lockdowns. A year ago, they were barely at 25% of pre-pandemic levels. Airlines are enjoying a travel comeback as Americans get vaccinated — but travelers are getting a side of problems along with their roasted peanuts.</p>
<p>&rt;#Precheck won't help you... when the pilot is MIA. Airlines are dealing with a shortage of pilots and airport workers. Now that demand is back, airlines can't flip the pilot switch so quickly. Pilots who were furloughed or took leaves of absence during the pandemic have to be retrained — so do other workers, including those who check planes. The shortage is magnified when bad weather and other disruptions come up. That's resulted in:</p>
<p>&rt;Delays: Nearly 10K flights were delayed in the US on Sunday. Southwest had the most delays, with 30% of flights running late.
Cancellations: American Airlines had significant cancellations on Sunday, and proactively canceled 1K flights set for July.</p>
