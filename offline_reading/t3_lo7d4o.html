    <strong>I don't care what the doomers say, masks restrict breathing.</strong>
    <p><p>As the title says. I wear one for 8 to 9 hours a day at work, and yeah, the effects are barely noticeable. I can perform all my tasks and not get winded.</p>
<p>However, on Fridays the last part of my work week involves bringing anywhere between 15 to 40 pounds of leftover product back to our other location. My parking spot is near the back of the parking lot and it's a good little hike. Normally, as soon as I leave the building I set the box down and take off my mask and continue on my way.</p>
<p>Yesterday was cold, and the box was heavy, and I really just wanted to get to my car quickly and start my weekend so I kept on trucking with my mask on.</p>
<p>I've carried this box many times when it was just as heavy, without my mask and I'd never felt as breathless by the time I got to the car as I did yesterday. My heart was beating out of my chest and felt as if I'd just run a marathon.</p>
<p>I know I'm preaching to the choir here but just thought I'd share this little anecdote for any lurking doomers.</p>
<p>Have a good weekend everyone.</p></p>

        <p>There’s a video of a fire fighter using a device that shows the drop of 20 percent oxygen.  Maybe it’s fake but considering you feel the drop and theres an easily understood demonstration, you don’t need 5 peer reviewed papers from elite universities to trust your basic senses now do you?    </p>
<p>Also, a couple years ago i was cycling in a busy city and i thought i would try one of the smog masks. Turns out i was getting a huge ‘head high’ probably from the oxygen depth then the sudden rush of oxygen returning.  So I stopped using that and stopped worrying. </p>
<p>I’d laugh at all the pro maskers, except for how vicious they are in their new clown world, and especially all the damage being done to children. they really don’t care about anyone despite their lip service to the contrary.</p>

        <p>There's also plenty of videos showing a drop of less than 1% in blood oxygen levels, and a similarly insignificant increase in CO2 saturation, while wearing a mask.</p>
<p>If you can't breathe in a mask then I don't know what to tell you. Doctors have no issue doing incredibly difficult surgical procedures while wearing a mask, but go ahead and keep believing whatever bs you want. Clearly nobody is going to change your mind at this point.</p>

        <p>They're literally trying to kill everyone. If they weren't they wouldn't mandate mask wearing or keep fast food open while telling you not to go outside. They wouldn't inject us with experimental psuedoscience. They wouldn't psychologically torture and traumatize the masses into committing suicide and other atrocities. Masks cause you to breathe your own bacteria, carbon dioxide and other microbes. Clearly they're trying to kill us.</p>

        <p>The same. I can’t get even slightly out if breath with a mask on without needing to pull it off. I think it may have something to do with a build up of CO2.  One paper on this is https://aaqr.org/articles/aaqr-20-07-covid-0403</p>
<p>I think more people experience this but are afraid to say.</p>

        <p>I mean there are elevation training masks with a valve. Meant to simulate higher altitudes with less oxygen. So obviously a muzzle will result in a decrease in oxygen. People have used it as a training device for years</p>

        <p>I'm pretty healthy and in decent shape. But walking up stairs with 20 lbs with a mask was enough to make me have to walk outside and get real air. I haven't had that much difficulty breathing than before I quit smoking.</p>
