    <strong>So the vaccinated are contagious. What can we do to protect ourselves? Is there anything that we *can* do?</strong>
    <p><p>I haven't taken the vaccine, and neither have my kids, but if the shedding hypothesis is correct (and I imagine that it probably is) it doesn't seem like that's going to be enough to save us from whatever the intended effects of the jab are. But hey, I'm no quitter, so let's talk strategy: is there anything that the unvaccinated can do to protect themselves?  Dietary changes, medications, vitamins....anything?  There's got to be <em>something</em> that can stop mRNA transmission, right?</p></p>

also, not sure it’s actually accurate, but I have had a LOT os snot, thought it might be just allergies (rhinosinusitis here☝️) are these the main symptoms for delta plus or whatever (lost track already..)?</p>

        <p>IIRC the "shedding" is picking up spike protiens from the enviroment, which is not at all the same as injecting something into your bloodstream that generates spike protiens which has been shown in the Japanese FOIA autopsy to end up in every organ.</p>

        <p>I've been trying to get some legit sources on mrna vaccine shedding but can't find any. Can anyone help? I spent some time with my grandmother and she has been vaccinated for a while and all of a sudden I got sick, no big deal, just a stomach ache and some fever. I would like to believe the two events are unrelated but I can't stop thinking about vaccine shedding. Can someone help me out?</p>

        <p>Twitter deleted a tweet by mRNA developer Dr Luigi Warren about viral shedding on May 26th last year, although he stated that the amounts would be too small to cause illness: </p>
<p>“I believe the ‘shedding’ idea is that the vaccinated shed spike protein, not virus. And, it’s certainly true that people vaccinated with mRNA vaccines shed spike protein, but in miniscule amounts that almost certainly can’t cause disease/malaise in others,” Luigi Warren wrote on Twitter on May 26.</p>
<p>And Pfizer's own documents advise that physical contact with a vaccinated person can result in occupational exposure in non-vaccinated people:</p>
<p>“An occupational exposure occurs when a person receives unplanned direct contact with a vaccine test subject, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an adverse event.  These people may include health care providers, family members, and other people who are around the trial participant.”</p>
<p>Speculation about vaccine shedding and its effects seems to be largely anecdotal at the moment, but I think there's enough online chatter about people being ill after contact with vaccinated people to suspect that there's <em>something</em> going on here.</p>

        <p>Thanks, there appears to be something indeed but I don't want to feed the psicosomathic capacity of fear and paranoia.

        <p>Yes the below site looks old fashioned but please do not disregard. Bookmark and use it occasionally for the rest of your life. There are also medical papers you can read about vitamin c and covid.   Basically take some vitamin c tablets daily for the rest of your life. I've been doing this for years. It is the simplest, cheapest way to improve and maintain health. Feel free to YouTube Dr. Andrew Saul.  There are also many other ailments that can be improved with high dose vitamins.

        <p>I don't think it's something you have to worry about. However I've read that if it is a thing.. anise or fennel are the easiest to come by. You can get them in oils or ground into pills (lots of digestive aids have those ingredients)</p>

        <p>You're probably right...but that pine needle tea info has got me going down a rabbit hole.  Looking online, there seems to be some research about plant parasites using RNA to control their hosts.  I need to look into it further, but there <em>does</em> seem to be a link between so many of the purported treatments of Covid-19 in that they're often anti-parasitic in nature.  Perhaps anti-parasitics can impede mRNA function?</p>

        <p>Interesting and worth diving into. Let's stop calling it a rabbit hole and rather use terms like 'library-dig', I'm tired of going along with their labels of distraction. 
So ivermectin is an antiparasitic, and i know that garlic is too. Though this topic is above me when RNA is involved so I'll look through the likes of Tenpenny to get more insight. But from what i gather, there's not much one can do once that messenger rna passes the message as it becomes part of the blueprint.</p>
