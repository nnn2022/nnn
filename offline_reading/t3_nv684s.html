    <strong>International travel and your rights</strong>
    <p><p><strong><em>[Disclaimer] :</em></strong>  <em>I'm not trying to troll anyone. IANAL. For the purposes of this post I take no moral or political position. Nor I'm suggesting that you should cease your activism and certainly not that you must change your opinion. I merely wish to pass on what I know and I might well be wrong about something.Also I speak</em>  <strong>only</strong>  <em>of international travel.
P.s. There is some good news for you guys at the end (well, middle really).</em></p>
<p>There's a pretty simple reason a vaccine passport doesn't violate your rights to travel internationally; you don't really have any. </p>
<p>In regards to international travel you have 3 basic rights:</p>
<p>1) The right to leave any country. </p>
<p>2) The right to enter your country. </p>
<p>3) The right to seek asylum. </p>
<p>All 3 of these are regularily violated and no one really does anything but they are formal human rights and (in theory) bindning for all. </p>
<p>However since no one has a right to enter another country (aside from seeking asylum) any sovereign country can set pretty much whatever condition they want for you to enter. </p>
<p>Vaccine passports are nearing their centenary: this is not a new thing. Any country could set a flu vaccine as an entry requirement. The USA has previously required a negative AIDS test to enter and mandated polio vaccines for years while it was under experimental use authoritzation.</p>
<p>Anything can be required for entry or used as a reason for deportion. They can refuse you entry if the border guard dissaproves of your political opinion or deported because they don't like your hat. That's the world we live in and have for some time.</p>
<p>Vaccine requirements used to be ubiquitous. Especially smallpox. They dissapeared over time as the diseases became less prevalent. Until recently it was mostly just yellow fever and sometimes polio for a dozen or so poor countries. Now, thanks to corona, they're back in fashion.</p>
<p>So the <strong>good news</strong> is that they'll likely begin to dissapear once the corona virus subsides. Call me a sheep if you will but that's exactly what's happened to almost every other vaccine requirement. There will also probably be countries that don't check or lack the infrastructure to do so.</p>
<p>The TSA is notorious globally and "fortess Europe" is very real to the inhabitants of poorer countries. None of this is new for the global south.</p>
<p>I can give some examples from people who I know or experiences I've had if you want to know what might be required of you. If anyone is interested that is.</p>
<p>Lastly it's not the flight attendant's fault nor even that of your own politicians if you can't travel. It's likely requirements by the destination so don't curse out the wrong people. Also it's a rather bad idea to stage a protest at another country's border control. Cuddly Scandinavia might not even deport you but try that a ben Gurion and Shin Bet will make your life much more difficult. Depending on where you are you could be: banned from traveling to large parts of the world, face large fines or be imprisoned for years. The same is true if found to be traveling on false documents (e.g. fake vaccination proof). There is no appeal and no requirement to even tell you what you did.</p>
<p>Feel free to ask me whatever btw.</p>
<p>Edit: format; I'm on a phone.</p>
<p>2nd Edit: I forgot some <strong><em>good news</em></strong>: There is absolutely no global legal framework to make a China-style social credit system. That kinda already exists (it's called your passport) but upgrading that beyond what we already have will make getting the WTO moving again look easy.</p></p>

        <p>So there are no international rights to travel? When do you think the vaccine will be mandatory to travel and do you think all/most countries will require it? What about airlines?</p>

        <p>If it is "for the purpose of asylum" you can cross any border in theory. Though if you ever meet an asylum seeker they can tell you how little that means.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The vaccine passport will be rolled out as fast as it can be. Mid summer in Europe I think; similar for Japan. Poorer countries will take longer due to poorer infrastructure. Some might not bother or enforce it so poorly they might as well not. They will probably attempt to join the system so that their own citizens can travel to the developed world though.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I think every developed country will have some version of it. There should also be exemptions for people who can't take the vaccine for medical reasons. Some counties will likely have options like quarantine or pcr-test or vaccine. More paranoid countries might require all 3 or more but that would be uncommon. Australia seems to be planning to just stay shut.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Airlines actually have a much broader authority than most realize. This is because there are no cops in the air and so have the ability to blacklist anyone they feel like. Especially since 9/11. For domestic flights ymmv though. It depends on where you live and the composition of your legal system and government. There are some human rights to travel your country that could be invoked but that's a bit of a long-shot.</p>

        <p>Ne post because I forgot about dual-citizenship. The right to enter your country extends to any country you have citizenship of.</p>
<p>My father has a friend who was in the US when global air-travel half shut down over corona. He wanted to go home to Austria where he has citizenship but couldn't find a plane going there. Since he's originally Swedish he has citizenship there too and there was a plane going there. So he flew to Stockholm which could not deny him entry and then to Vienna ditto. No questions asked.</p>

        <p>Glad I could help. It was always thus. You probably just didn't notice until now because you have a privileged passport and were given the global version of vip treatment. </p>
<p>Also a privileged time. My mother was once informed in Rio that she could either take the cholera shot (thick needle - straight into the stomach) at the airport or she would be put on the next plane back to Sweden. I can give more weird examples.</p>

        <p>(sorry I didn't notice your reply until now) 
They probably just didn't have restrictions on you. It depends on where you come from. I'm very grateful that my passport opens so many doors for me so easily. Had you had a Yemeni or Pakistani passport they might have demanded a polio shot.</p>
<p>Am I right in assuming you are American (USA)?</p>
