    <strong>This pandemic has fucked me over mentally</strong>
    <p><p>What we had when it was a pretty normal life was something that people got used to overtime.   </p>
<p>However, when you go from that to a life that was heavily restricted and even locked down it really impacts people mentally. Going from being able to do almost anything, to following a new specific set of "guidelines" as you went about your day to day life in the "new normal". At the beginning of the pandemic within the first month or so it was the worst. Between the media and my household we all toke things very seriously. Although I wanted to still go out and live my life things were restricted anyway. From not being able to see my friends or family outside of my household. To almost not being allowed to visit the girlfriend because the "job she was working at was high risk". It actually had to take some "convincing" that if I wasn't even allowed to go see her things would have ended up more bad.   </p>
<p>However, only just being allowed to see the girlfriend was just borrowed time. Borrowed time that eventually us not being able to go out and have fun together was starting to weigh on me mentally. I believe she was even feeling it too because a lot of the time we would look at each other asking ourselves "what do we want to do today?" Well what could we do? You couldn't go to the movies, restaurant, etc. Even if you could there was the "Covid protocols" you had to follow of being scared of people being close to you and wearing a mask that makes it feel like your suffocating. Or when you would try to wear it only to not accept it as something that should be "normal" it got harder. Everything around here involved having to have one on even if you were shopping for food. There was a time where the state even wanted us to wear it outside which I immediately called bullshit on that.   </p>
<p>Unfortunately for a while I complied. It actually wasn't until I got the vaccine a few months ago before I woke up. All that time we were promised things would go back to normal when we would get one. Then it started to get complicated where they would say the vulnerable people need to be vaccinated first. Fine I get it they don't have as good as an immune system so makes sense. Well after that phase they then said we needed "everyone" to get vaccinated. That was when I started to wake up. I knew not "everyone" needed it. I knew there were people out there that could handle Covid and recover fine. Not everyone's immune system is crap yet the CDC and the government wanted you to be afraid of getting close to anyone that you don't know if the virus will kill them or not.   </p>
<p>Then back to normal started to get really grim after they constantly changed around the goal posts. From Christmas to the 4th of July to 2022 according to the best scientist in the world Bill Gates. Going from a smaller goal of getting the most vulnerable vaccinated to trying to get everyone vaccinated was a huge wake up call. Thankfully so far I have been fine from the vaccine at least as far as I can tell. For the record I STILL haven't been able to go visit the doctors for a check up because they STILL require masks and I just can't wear one. So I don't know when I will be able to go back to the doctors again. I could always try to convince them I can't wear a mask, but I am sure patients have tried that too.   </p>
<p>Now life is kind of back to normal. When I say kind of I mean there are still people I see go around wearing masks. I've seen some jobs where it's a mixed baggage of employees and customers either wearing or not wearing them. Jobs have either let all employees stop wearing them, some wear them or there are some where everyone still wears them. You still need to wear one on public transportation which people do rely on unless they drive. Inflation at least with gas thus far has gone up in my area. I want to find a job with better pay, but not if it makes me wear a mask the whole time. I also don't want this whole "vaccine passport" to become a thing because on top of it feeling invasive to your medical privacy it would also be a nuisance. Imagine being in a line because the stores require it so customers have to line up so they can scan whatever app they need their "vaccine passport' for that state. Even though I can see my friends or family now nobody has really been like "hey let's meet up again!"   </p>
<p>The normal we once new is gone. The simple fact that things can go from being normal to all the sudden restricted with a blink of an eye isn't "normal". Anytime I go out now I am always finding myself asking "how long is this going to last?" If governments are able to just flip a switch to make businesses for changes onto people's lives who is to say they won't do it again? This pandemic has left me and thousands of others with mental health issues we never had before. The pandemic has caused people even more distrust in the government if they didn't already. It caused a divide between people who think it's fine for those to do whatever they want and those who now think everyone is contagious.  They will constantly use variants to scare people and all they have to do is come out with one with a new name to say how much more deadly the transmission is.</p></p>

        <p>Never getting to relax anywhere has messed me up. They could do this shit all over again too. I don't think it's really over either. All the vaxxed are happily running to their weird outdoor activities feeling like they've been rescued, the kidnappers gave them a respite. I am not so happy. I don't trust the system anymore either.</p>

        <p>I feel you man. The very real impact on mental health has been largely ignored. Public health now seems only geared towards vaccinating and distancing people from one another, rather than the many little things that keep a person mentally resilient and in good physical health, like socializing and freedom of movement.</p>
<p>I would look into trying mindfulness meditation. The media is there to steal your peace of mind; to make you feel hopeless, anxious, angry, depressed, etc; it is what keeps people going back for more. Own your peace of mind, practice grounding yourself through deep breathing and focused attention to that breath. Focus on the things you can control and relish in the people and things that bring you happiness. It is frustrating and depressing what is being done by governments around the world, but hope is not lost. The government's #1 fear is a population in good health and spirit, and we need to exploit that fear as best as we possibly can. Keep your chin up OP, you are far from alone in this struggle.</p>
