        <p>Hey there my friend. I have spent a lot of time over the last month's providing studies, interviews etc... As sources in my attempt to raise awareness with people in countless discussions.</p>
<p>Where I find myself now, is that I am here, in this group,. primarily to find support with like-minded people.</p>
<p>There are many studies and other resources etc... On the web (although generally speaking they're harder to find these days due to censorship) also as posts on this sub. The answers are there if you want to find them.</p>
<p>But personally, as far as I'm concerned, the lines in the sand are drawn, people have chosen their stance, and I don't have the energy nor inclination at this point to overly try to change other people's perceptions.</p>
<p>If that means you think as a result of that, that "I'm just making it up" or whatever else..... so be it. 🤷‍♂️</p>

        <p>Yes, I do think that you are making it up just like so many do in this subreddit. </p>
<p>In fact, I was interested enough to see if what you said was true and unfortunately it's not. I could not find a single link or citation relevant to COVID-19 in the last month on your profile let alone that you have "spent a lot of time over the last month's providing studies, interviews". So I call bullshit. Feel free to look at my profile and see the citations I've provided to the actual peer reviewed research. It's disappointing but typical to see someone lying in this subreddit.</p>
<p>Studies that support your position are not hard to find because of censorship, they are hard to find because the position and beliefs of this subreddit are not grounded in evidence and rationality. They are based in paranoia, bullshit and magical thinking. Your answers are cherry picked and the result of confirmation bias. Anyone with a rational bone in their body would be far more interested in the actual evidence and welcome someone challenging their beliefs.</p>
<p>Saying lines being drawn is another bullshit statement. You should have "strong beliefs weakly held" in that a single compelling piece of evidence should be enough to change you mind. It would be for me and any other scientist worth their salt but again, that is not what we see here. I'm constantly doubting my knowledge because that is how we get to the truth.</p>
<p>Beliefs inform our actions so yes, I do care enough to try to at least challenge people to see that the world is not flat, that fairies aren't real, that homeopathy does not work and that COVID is a clear and serious danger to the world that requires all our efforts to combat.</p>
<p>On that small chance that you are open to changing your mind, what evidence would you need to see to change your mind about the new normal? You seem like a genuinely good person who has been through a lot and I have the greatest respect for your attitude otherwise but your approach to this is misguided to say the least.</p>

        <p>&rt;Yes, I do think that you are making it up just like so many do in this subreddit. </p>
<p>I appreciate you owning that, it feels easier (over here) as a result to engage with you, I appreciate the transparency.</p>
<p>&rt;On that small chance that you are open to changing your mind, what evidence would you need to see to change your mind about the new normal?</p>
<p>To be honest. I cannot imagine any "evidence" that would change my mind. For the reason that my position has been made up, primarily by what I can directly observe, feel, sense about what is happening. So I would have to discount an inner knowing, that we (and I) are fundamentally being lied to and manipulated by the powers that be.</p>
<p>It sounds like you have checked some of my other sub posts, and I am glad that as a result, I seem a good (if misguided in this) person to you. I do feel your care and respect. It's greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>I often seem to invoke in others, especially when they are aware of the trauma I have suffered and carry. That I am unable to separate the external world from my own stuff. That I project my trauma out onto the world.</p>
<p>Picking that one apart is a pretty long discussion in and of itself. I guess in short, I could say, that by my best sense, that is not what is happening. And I appreciate how easily it may seem to others that that is what I am doing.</p>
<hr>
<p>&rt;Beliefs inform our actions</p>
<p>I agree to an extent, or as the norm. That is often the case. It sounds like you are a scientist? You are obviously highly intelligent, and that you care, and are a good person also. I do see that.</p>
<p>I have no problem considering I am wrong or inaccurate. In fact I would say my willingness to consider such, is one of my "strengths".</p>
<p>I guess, to try and explain my sense making, and where I find myself now, is the result of a decade long journey, of questioning everything about the world and myself... And gradually coming to live, trust and follow (through my own rigorous practice, checks, balances, experimentations, processing and study), from the inside out. From information that's comes from deeper in the body, a compass bearing if you will.</p>
<p>Absolutely critical thinking, hard data, rigourous science etc... Is important for navigating and understanding the world. And I have come to believe, that over reliance on the cognitive realm, unanchored in the deeper currents below, is part of the challenge we face as a species to remember our inherent beauty and role in the order of life.</p>
<p>And, in my own journey, I have come to experience, ever more profoundly, how completely a human can come to truth from within. From somewhere deeper than the beliefs that we may hold. It is part of the same place, that guides me through my healing of trauma, the unfolding and remembering of what I suffered.</p>
<p>To be a bit less waffling about it. I could say "my gut knows that something is terribly off" with the whole situation around the virus.</p>
<p>I would also offer, that I suspect,  that deep down, every human knows truth. That it is part of a long forgotten birthright. </p>
<p>I.e. I suspect, that deep down, every human knows - that fundamentally we are being misled. That the response does not add up.</p>
<p>I do not think, our society supports connecting to, nor living from such a place.</p>
<p>I can see, and have observed the situation (Rona) develop from the very beginning, the shifting goalposts, the changing measures, the narratives ("new normal" "build back better"), the censorship of divergent opinions...</p>
<p>I'm not <em>just</em> going off my gut, I'm going off what I have observed by watching the patterns and actions first, the narrative second.</p>
<p>Now of course this could neatly become a version of me projecting my trauma onto the world. </p>
<p>But unfortunately (for me), I fear I am accurate in my gut, observations, and research. (In that order) it is a far from convenient position for me to take.</p>
<p>I do not think I will be able to provide data for you that would shift your position. And that it ok for me, I have tried doing a LOT of that over the last year, debating friends and associates who are professors, scientists, drug manufacturers as well as other less <em>qualified</em> friends of mine. I've just got to the point where I think most people's positions are entrenched (i.e. lines drawn in the sand) either way. And I choose to no longer use excessive energy in trying to affect that.</p>
<p>I can absolutely appreciate you are doing the right thing as you see it. And that you choose to use that energy to try and change others minds. I think the movement of that, is from noble and good intention.</p>
<p>Thankyou so much for seeing me that in something's I'm am worthy of respect. And I totally understand and appreciate how I am (or might be) misguided in some areas, certainly so in the eyes of others.</p>
<p>I do believe, we are all trying in our own ways, to fight for humanity and the world. </p>
<p>&rt; I could not find a single link or citation relevant to COVID-19 in the last month on your profile let alone that you have "spent a lot of time over the last month's providing studies, interviews"</p>
<p>Yes, I think there's an assumption at your end that I can clarify. I'm fairly new to Reddit. The afore mentioned debates were largely had on Facebook, Twitter, and in person. I deleted facebook and Twitter a while ago, partly due to abuse and ridicule, partly due to my; trying to represent my position with the virus - playing into narratives others held about me regarding other issues in my life.</p>
<p>You are right. That on Reddit I haven't done those things. Intact, my intention on here is more oriented at looking for those of like minds or experience, whatever the topic.</p>
<p>&rt;It's disappointing but typical to see someone lying in this subreddit.</p>
<p>Is it clear to you now, that I was not lying? I didn't say I had done those things on Reddit. Respectfully, you assumed that's what I meant. I hope I have filled in some gaps to clarify that.</p>
<p>I wish you all the best, and absolutely see you are fighting for what you believe in.</p>

        <p>Firstly, thank you for a well written and heartfelt post. Yes, I did read your post history and I can only say you have my greatest respect and admiration in the strength and courage you demonstrate in some of your other subreddits. I have been very fortunate in not having to face some of the challenges that you have, but if I had done I would hope that I fronted up to the world with half the dignity you do.</p>
<p>That said, I feel that you are overly reliant on your gut and intuition. I appreciate that it allows you to operate at an obviously high level in other areas of your life but it allows you to kid yourself. Science is the art of doubt, the mechanism of disciplined distrust and skepticism. Science is merely a heuristic, and the best one that we know of, that allows us to be confident that our beliefs align with reality and that we have minimised bias, error and prejudice. I was a scientist and by that I mean I had a lab, a white-coat (very important!) and certificates on the wall at a prestigious University but I no longer work in that space. However, I am still passionate that people belief as much as it true and as little as is false since this is how we progress as a species. You freely admit that nothing would change your mind. This is a faith based position and since there is nothing that cannot be believed based on faith, it means that you cannot say that you position <em>is</em> true or not only that it <em>feels</em> true and there lies the dragons of confirmation bias and cherry picking.</p>
<p>This subreddit is an echo-chamber that reinforces group think. I posted a review (1) that demonstrated without doubt that asymptomatic people transmit the virus which makes wearing masks an entirely sensible thing to do even if you think you do not have COVID. In this sub-reddit, it was immediately down voted for no other reason than it conflicted with the "accepted" truths. This subreddit often contains staggering amounts of ignorance and I will do my part in guiding and educating others where the topic strays into my areas of expertise.</p>
<p>I will walk back my statement on lying given you clarified your position but I hope you will not hold that against me given the ambiguity of your comment. A quick glance here will show you that there are so many wrong statements, it's the exception that is not a lie or mistruth.</p>
<p>I wish you joy and harmony in your journey.</p>

        <p>I dont have a link, but I'm told by a nurse I know that hospitals had been quietly using HCQ and seeing success in some patients since even before Trump ever mentioned it and it became political.  Well, except for when our governor banned it for a month.  They didn't use it then.</p>

        <p>Peter McCullough, mentioned in the screenshot above, pretty much makes the case that is WAS about making sure everyone was as sick as possible, because:</p>
<p>1) Hospitals stopped doing normal medical procedures in anticipation of a huge wave of COVID patients.  That wave never came.</p>
<p>2) The Federal government decided to reimburse hospitals for COVID patients, making it the primary way hospitals could stay afloat after they were bleeding cash because of the point above.</p>
<p>3) The evidence for HCL's effectiveness came about at the same time as the Feds were committing to the vaccine program with the Big Pharma firms, and so the Feds basically shut down research of HCL so as to not obstruct their plans with Big Pharma.</p>
