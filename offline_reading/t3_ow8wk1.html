    <strong>Any other liberals never voting dem again?</strong>
    <p><p>Sorry if this offends anyone or if this is too political, please delete it. I read the rules and it didn't say I couldn't post political opinions so I'm doing so but if I made a mistake I do apologize.</p>
<p>Sad to say that the current democrat party resembles nothing that I recognize as true liberal ideology anymore. Whatever they are now seems like what might happen if communism and facism had a baby. I can't possibly get behind it anymore. I really was never a deeply political person but given that I was raised in a democrat voting family and I always agreed with the ideals surrounding more liberty rather than less liberty, and some amount of social welfare I almost always in the past would vote democrat and tended to favor the more left leaning news sources. I also disliked all the 9/11 stuff and felt it was fear mongering propaganda which now it seems was just mere glimpse of what would be in 2020 and beyond. Anyway I'm never voting for another single Democrat ever again after this crap, unless they switch sides and the Republicans use some excuse to fear monger everyone with propaganda to gain power while the dems defend freedom. Basically I'm not on any side but the side of liberty and freedom and the basic purposes of America's creation. I've heard some people say the Republicans are just exploiting upon these facist fallacies of the left by pretending to care about those of us who are disenchanted with all the covid restrictions. Well if that's true I really don't care, I'm voting for whoever will protect my liberties before I concern myself with abortion rights, Marijuana legalization or any other typically political right vs left issue. Frankly as much as I wish weed was legal or whatever, I'd rather live in a country where it's illegal and still be able to send my kids to school without a face diaper strapped on them, or have medical freedom, or not sit back and watch millions of small businesses be swallowed up and bankrupted while the corporations lap up all their lost customers due to another lockdown.</p></p>

        <p>Loved your post. I feel very much the same way. I’m so shocked at how my liberal peeps were all about “my body my choice” and “we are the 99%”. Now, in a complete reversal they are promoting mandated medical treatment (goodbye freedom) and they are like paid spokespeople for the 1%. It blows my mind.</p>

        <p>Yeah Me too!! I was around 17 when all the 9/11 stuff went down.. at that time it seemed that liberals were the ones objecting to liberties being stripped in exchange for the illusion of safety over a sesationalized, overblown fear. Now it seems the tables have completely turned. What a circus.</p>

        <p>I think the problem is deeper than republican vs democrat.  I think both parties have problems.  </p>
<p>What led me down the path was the fact that after stepping back and looking closely there didn't seem to be much difference between R or D administrations when it comes to actions.  If you think back to Bush 1 through Obama, the same themes crop up.  Nothing is done to secure the border.  Constant call for military action in some country or other.  Erosion of privacy and individual rights.  Increasing deficit spending.  Trade agreements that hurt the US and benefit other countries.  Those things are important to me.  Sure they took turns paying lip service, D's say they are against war mongering, R's say they are against deficit spending but both continue the same actions when they have power.</p>
<p>Sure under D's they pass more environmental, lgbtq, etc legislation to pander to part of their base and make the R's howl, Then the R's cut some taxes, spend more on the military and etc to pander to their base.  But the big things, they do the same.  </p>
<p>I think there is a broad number of R's and D's that control both parties that are bought and paid for by large corps.  Big Ag, Big Pharm, Defense contractors, and etc.  They write the laws, and trade agreements, then lobby (pay) congressional members to pass them.  </p>
<p>On the D side you have a growing group who have lost the plot.  They want to sacrifice our economy on the alter of environmentalism, they want complete control of everything.  They want socialism.</p>
<p>On the R side there is a large movement that is on the verge of capturing control.  They want a secure border, they aren't against immigration, they just want them screened and to come legally.  They want to rollback the erosion of our rights and privacy.  They want to put America first when making trade agreements.  They think a clean and protected environment can be achieved without the more draconian measures.  They want welfare/medicare for people who need it without forcing everyone into it.  They are tired of the forever war and constant military intervention in places we really have no business being.</p>
<p>Trump is the first politician to actually fight and make headway in those areas.  Its amazing he got anything done.  Sure he isn't eloquent and he is too self-centered but I can live with that.  There are too many stories of him doing good for random people, especially people that work for him, and I seriously doubt any career politician in DC could withstand the amount of scrutiny he went through without clear evidence of crimes being uncovered.</p>
<p>We just need to complete the takeover of the R party.  Toss the career politicians that are blocking the agenda.  Then don't let the far right drag us into stupid things that we don't support like banning gay marriage, or making more stupid drug laws.  Make it a party for main street America instead of the party of Wall street.</p>

        <p>in all countries the rich always and still make the rules. Even from the start to be in a government only those selected by the rich can be voted on. So ofcourse most members of the government will make rules favoring the rich rulers. If we want real change our society must do something drastic.</p>

        <p>I think it’s a decent option to switch your affiliation to an Independent. I did the same as before I marked that I was a republican but I can’t say I’m comfortable with identifying myself as a Democrat or Republican because I’m more issue focused.</p>

        <p>I switched from dem to independent last year. I still want to believe that voting matters. So I can’t say that I’ll never vote for another dem again, but I will be sure to not vote blind and do every bit of research I can on people before I vote for them (especially in smaller elections because that’s where this bananas shit gets started).</p>

        <p>Being left-leaning (last I checked being a civil/social libertarian counts as left) I concur on almost all of this. I can relate too, as the other lefties on here do I'm sure... with everyone seeing in real time liberals embrace authoritarianism/corporatism with open arms and turn into everything they once claimed to be against even just 15-20 years ago. I don't vote myself because ever since I've been of voting age I've NEVER found a candidate I WOULD vote for (Ron Paul, though he's not perfect came close but I mean realistically there's NO WAY they'd let a candidate who is for abolishing the Federal Reserve slip through the cracks) and I am NOT playing their "lesser of two evils" game. All it does is ensure that things either continue the way they have been or get worse. I am EMBARRASSED with the Neoliberal CLOWNS (at best, at worst fascists who don't make mean tweets) that are in power now. Even if it IS true that the right is just exploiting the lefties who question the Neoliberal doctrine... it's because the left sits on their hands and LETS them do so in the first place. When the RIGHT are authoritarian it's blatant but with the LEFT it's even worse because they're total snakes about it and when they fail they have the NERVE to play the damn culture war cards and blame Russia instead of looking in the mirror. Plus these Neoliberals have NO principles... just like Kamala Harris saying she would NEVER take the Trump vaccine yet here she and Dementia Joe are trying to push it on everybody! It's just been tragic over the past 1 1/2 years (and before) seeing so many freethinking friends and family members cheer for medical slavery and forced vaccinations... yet they'd be losing their shit and scrounging to find their way to Mexico (or Canada) if it were Orange Man doing the same thing. Truly sad.</p>

        <p>Same. At this point I'm deeply suspicious of both parties and the only issue I'm voting on is who's more against the lockdowns/vaccine passports/whatever other great reset bullshit they're trying to shove down our throats this week. Which, in practice, means voting Republican a lot of the time as I want these fascist Democrats OUT.</p>

        <p>I don't care about politics, both sides lie and they just want to win at their game.</p>
<p>But yeah, last election i went down the R column, i couldn't see myself voting for any D to hold a political position anywhere.  They've lost their damn minds and i can't associates with them.  It's weird when I suddenly associated on more things with the right because they seemed more level headed.</p>

        <p>I'm a Gen Xer and a fiscal conservative (Republican voter) except for health care. I've lived in countries with EXCEPTIONAL single payer health care systems and know that they work...very well. I WISH I could vote for a Democrat. Not going to happen unless JFK is cloned. They went from slightly left of center to utterly fucking nuts. (Side note, we've probably already passed the point of no return on health care as we've spent our money plus a whole bunch of borrowing on unnecessary wars and other bullshit).</p>

        <p>Just my 2 cents:</p>
<p>The issue with government isnt who is in charge.</p>
<p>Surely, there are better and worse candidates, but the issue is the inherent structure. Government by definition is there to rule. As such any form of government will lead to social tension, because there is literally no issue we agree on in unisono. Whether you have a dictatorial government run by a single person deciding on his whim, or whether it is a democracy were a majority decides. Even if the democracy is an actual one were it isnt a simple majority rules, but compromises being made between the positions (no matter how minor the opposition may be), the structure still remains.</p>
<p>Everyone unhappy with the current ruling, will be unhappy. This will always lead to the tension, that we can see everywhere around the world. No matter, how free a supposed society is, no matter how rich a country is. The tension is always there.</p>
<p>Honestly, I have a though time finding a politician, were I can say: "This one, s/he should have the power to decide aspects of my life."</p>
<p>As someone who doesnt want to rule others, I can confidently say: No one will satisfy me, in the way they want to rule over me.</p>
<p>Whats most depressing about our current state is that there isnt a single body I am involved with, where this form of ruling is indeed needed. Whether it is at work or in private, there simply is no need for governance.</p>
<p>And in my critique I dont even need to point at fiscal policies, lobbyism, corruption, opinion-sovereignity and all those other factors that actively influence our governance to the point that democracy has become nothing but a joke, a really bad one even...</p>

        <p>When I have voted (I've refrained from voting a few times out of protest because of the poor quality of candidates), it has always been republican, but 95% of that reasoning is the hot-button issues, like abortion.  I did not come from a political family at all, so my family never really influenced me it was a personal belief I developed on my own.</p>
<p>However, Republicans have always let me down. They focused on protecting big business so much that they forgot that we have anti-trust laws to protect us from the tyranny of big business. The republicans also focused on protecting the rich too much. Their fights against high estate taxes have led to the oligarchies we have today. High estate taxes were imposed in our country, originally, to prevent just that. They were meant to prevent families from passing down huge amounts of wealth from one generation to the next to the next to the next. </p>
<p>Today, in the midst of all of this chaos, republicans have continued to let me down and have shown to be weak. Where is their outrage about people still locked up on January 6th? Where is the outrage about forced vaccinations? Why aren't they calling a spade a spade about Hunter Biden's art corruption? Why are they not up in arms? Why are they not calling a spade a spade and just say it, "our president is a pedo." Why is McCarthy defending big tech? </p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, there are a few republicans that I admire, but most are bought and paid and most at the local level are not as corrupt as they are at the national level, but I will never vote for another republican just because of the R by their name.</p>

        <p>Communism at it's core typically refers to a system intended to be rid of class.  To transform production into something communally owned.  </p>
<p>Yes there are similarities, if you're referring to places such as USSR.  Those similarities are the authoritarian power the state is consolidating.  But that's nothing exclusive to Communism, authoritarianism can creep up under any economic system.</p>
<p>So I would ask you what similarities you see between the current dems or republicans and communism?  Because personally I see little to none in America or Canada.</p>

        <p>Censorship: Communists (especially those in power) do not allow opposing views or debate (in theory they do, in reality they DO NOT)
Social programs government run (not optional) are Socialism...can you think of any in USA or Canada? LOL
Rigged elections: Communist governments rig their elections. It is easy to see now that elections in Democratically held areas are rigged, that’s why they use “RACIST!” To prevent verification of right to vote.
I could go on and on, but there is a saying: “One convinced against their will is of the same opinion still.”
If you think there are no similarities here in North America to Communist China...you have been asleep for a long time. I encourage you to start asking “Why” (why this, why that, etc) as a way to check/test your awareness of what is and is not going on.</p>

        <p>Censorship has been well established in Marxist theory for a while.  But there's nothing unique in that regard.  Censorships exists in damn near every capitalist country that's existed.  </p>
<p>You've switched the discussion from Communism to Socialism.  There are not the same thing.  Marx has written extensively on the issues with a welfare state.  This was not an idea founded in Communist ideology.  Regardless, if you define Socialism as government programs, then every single government in the history of the world is Socialist, all the way as far back as ancient Greece. </p>
<p>Communist governments rig their elections? Sure some definitely have.  But again this is a characteristic of an authoritarian or totalitarian government.  America has been rigging elections around the world for years.  There's nothing exclusively Communist in this.</p>
<p>Even in regards to China.  China is not a Communist country, not since Deng's market reforms anyways.  But even under Mao China never achieved Communism.  You're confusing the two because it's a country RULED by a Communist party, but that does not mean it's a Communist country.  In the same regard North Korea calls themselves "Democratic People's Republic of Korea", but we all know the DPRK is not democratic.  You'd do well not to let what they call themselves confuse you, it's not always honest. </p>
<p>Officially the Chinese call themselves "Socialist with Chinese characteristics".  In practicality it's state capitalism, the same way Lenin viewed the USSR during his time.  Capitalism controlled by the state, workers don't own the means of production, markets run rampant, rigid class structures.  There's nothing Communist about modern day China.  </p>
<p>I don't disagree with the connections you're making, I disagree with what you're attributing these connections too.  Communism is not the root cause.  These issues come from a state with too much power and control over their population.  There's nothing exclusively Communist in that regard.</p>
