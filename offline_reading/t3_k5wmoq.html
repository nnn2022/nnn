        <p>Frankly, I don't disagree. At all.</p>
<p>We are fucking over entire generations of youth and young adults and marginalised/poor/disadvantaged people just because of what? "Don't kill granny who's probably got 10 years or less to live"?</p>
<p>If someone's going to catch COVID and suffer badly/die from it, chances are they'd have suffered the same had they caught any of the known flu coronaviruses we already live with on a daily basis. Even those still kill or make people really sickly when we have annual flu shots available, that we're supposed to take a new one of EVERY YEAR because the virus fucking MUTATES, but most people won't and still get by fine anyway.</p>
<p>You want to be a doomer? Go right ahead. Because the ones being the doomers are boomers whereas millennials and Gen Zs and every subsequent younger generation now are basically looking at the fundamental building block years of their life utterly collapse just so Doomers can act like you live in petri dishes.</p>

        <p>How am I as a 26 year old meant to forgive the people who've done this and gone along with it? My grandad is perfectly happy to destroy my future so he can 'feel safe' (from something which even as an octogenerian with diabetes he still has an extremely favourable chance of beating) when there is absolutely no reason he couldn't do EVERY SINGLE THING that is mandated (wear a mask, gloves, use handwash, not go out etc) of his own free will without destroying my life and future. How am I meant to forgive other family members treating me like a fucking diseased leper, despite the fact I leave the house and come into contact with the general public on average 10 minutes per week. How do I forgive people for being fucking braindead zombies and turning their back on friends and family over absolute lies and propaganda?</p>
<p>I hope the feigned safety from doing things they could do anyway gained from sanctioning the destroying of my life is worth maybe 6 months from now, maybe 2 years, when they dont hear from me for a couple of weeks and I dont answer any calls, and they turn up at my house and finds me with bag taped over my head and an empty bottle of nitrogen next to me or swinging from the rafters. I hope the winds people they've sown are worth the whirlwind.</p>

        <p>THANK YOU! I too feel this way.  There are death rate increases because of covid, not the illness but the mania thats causing it. People are not thinking clearly thanks to media hype and not doing their OWN research which would lead to knowing this is a fucking tyrant move to be controlling the masses. Aint it funny how the ones who speak on the truth are locked away because they are "conspiracy theorists" ?</p>
<p>yeah cause the truth cant be let out to have this exposed... WAKE UP PEOPLE!!</p>

        <p>I am for opening everything up if we could all do it responsibly, everyone protect themselves, and if we did get sick, there would be the guarantee that our health care system would give us nothing but the best treatment for everyone. </p>
<p>But we don't have responsible people. </p>
<p>We don't have equity in our healthcare treatments.</p>
<p>We don't have our government bailing out small businesses in the US like they do when it comes to corporate wealthfare.</p>
<p>This isn't a failure of doomers, it's a failure of our social contract with our governments not providing for us in times of need. Cause people often step it up and sacrifice for their government, in the past it was soldiers and now its health care workers. We hit the most hospitalizations and now people are getting denied treatment.</p>
<p>If we can't get past a minor pandemic, what happens with a much worse, deadly, contagious pandemic?</p>

        <p>My mother had at least 20 years left to live, you ass.</p>
<p>She was only 69 years of age and from family history, she could have lived until 90 if this CoVid-19 had not gotten her and literally shut down her organs.</p>
<p>That said the mask mandates and lockdowns were not the proper way to go.</p>
<p>Why do I say that even though Mom died from this virus? Because she got it due to a negligent rehab center sending Dad home to us with this disease and killing both of them.</p>
<p>Not from going out of our home.</p>
<p>Something I have a malpractice lawyer looking into.</p>

        <p>Sorry for your loss. I lost my dad when he was only 53 to cancer. It hurts watching them go too soon, and I was only 14 so at least be thankful you didn't have to raise yourself after that.</p>
<p>We don't see this thing the same, but I just don't feel its appropriate nitpicking you after losing both parents. Hope you can find some peace of mind, and if you need it, a really good night's sleep.</p>

        <p>I wonder how many of these deaths were just assumed to be COVID and not actually COVID. According to the CDC those deaths are the same thing. Let's have a look together:</p>
<p>&rt;This email is to alert you that a newly-introduced ICD code has been implemented to accurately capture mortality data for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) on death certificates.  </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&rt;<em>What happens if the terms reported on the death certificate indicate uncertainty?</em><br>
If the death certificate reports terms such as “probable COVID-19” or “likely COVID-19,” these terms would be assigned the new ICD code.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&rt;<em>Should “COVID-19” be reported on the death certificate only with a confirmed test?</em><br>
COVID-19 should be reported on the death certificate for all decedents where the disease caused <strong>or is assumed to have caused or contributed to death.</strong></p>

        <p>I'm sorry, but we're never going to figure out what's true about the number of COVID deaths. That information simply isn't available to a layman. It is impossible that an individual has the resources to measure these things himself, so when next year comes around, we will have to rely on some potentially untrustworthy institution just to get the information, just like we're doing now. We will never actually know. We're just going to keep hearing about it from different authorities, same as we're doing now, and then we can decide whether we consider them truthful or not, just like we do now. And that's it.</p>
<p>however, look on the bright side! There is one thing we can be sure of, and in fact, we can be sure of it right now. We know for sure that if a person is at risk of becoming sick, and if a person is worried he will become sick, that person has the choice to stay away from others, so that he doesn't expose himself to sickness. If a person wants to be safe, he can do that, and he can do it right now. And if another person wants to take risks, he can also do that right now! This is very good news, wouldn't you agree? It's almost like we've completely solved the COVID problem already, and we don't need to change anything at all</p>

        <p>I'm American and it doesn't mean shit to me either.</p>
<p>WTF difference does 911 make? It's yet some more bullshit logical fallacy conflation. </p>
<p>How many people died of cancer in the same time frame?  How about malaria or TB?</p>
<p>Let's also not forget that we no longer have the flu or common cold, so those deaths, as well as virtually every death are coded as covid.</p>
<p>You fucking doomers need to screw your heads on straight.  O, that's right you don't have to because the reality is, if you are ok with the endless lockdowns and destruction of the economy, you likely didn't have much going on anyway. </p>
<p>I will leave u with this little gem: nature thins the herd, that's fucking reality. If you paid even a molecule of attention to your beloved experts, even with a vaccine, covid is here for good.  That means the herd is going to continue to get thinned, regardless of the doomer ranting.</p>
<p>So while you fawn over massive government intrusion and control into your life because 3k people died in day, recall back to last century where government was responsible for 100 million deaths...</p>
<p>Yea, I want that bunch making decisions for me.🙄</p>
