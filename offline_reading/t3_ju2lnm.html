        <p>Makes you wonder how much lower our official deaths counts would be if we simply used slightly lower PCR cycles to exclude dead viral particles... </p>
<p>I’d also like to compare to other countries, but I can’t find any good sources. </p>
<p>It’s time we start demanding this information be made public.</p>

        <p>And used standard counting rules instead of the insane ones pushed out in March. </p>
<p>This would be a bonus flu season totaling under 30,000 deaths.</p>

        <p>Additional information : </p>
<p>Dr. Lyons-Weiler breaks down how to evaluate COVID19 RT-PCR tests for the public.
Leaves you w/two calls to action - Email the FDA and the CDC and let's get rationality back into our public health and regulatory responses to COVID19. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibg8rDsATko</p>
<p>Dr. Jack discusses the bombshell fact that Dr. Sin Hang Lee found that 25% of the COVID19 validation reference samples sent to him were mislabeled. He managed to SEQUENCE SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide material out of samples labeled "negative" (which are actually ‘CDC-PCR negative’) and could not find any COVID19 material in some samples labeled "positive").

        <p>Factcheck.org -- A Fraudulent "Fact Check" Site Funded By Biased Political Group http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-bloggers/2923825/posts</p>
<p>Follow the money – understand who benefits from the rapidly expanding, pseudo-fact-checking racket, with many organisations having a clear conflicts of interest with the 'fact checkers' on which they rely</p>
<p>Most fact checking organisations are members of the International Fact-Checking Network set up by the Poynter Institute for Media Studies. Amongst its funders are the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and Google, along with Omidyar Network.</p>
<p>Here's our shortlist of some of the most influential 'fact-checking' sites.</p>
<p>Health Feedback</p>
<p>Health Feedback is part of Science Feedback. A not-for-profit organisation that says it verifies “…the credibility of influential claims and media coverage that claims to be scientific”. Its fact checkers are scientists who they say “…sort fact from fiction in health and media coverage”. Its list of funders includes Facebook and the Credibility Coalition whose funders also include Google, Twitter and Facebook.</p>
<p>Politifact</p>
<p>Best known for its political oversight, Politfact has turned its attention to the pandemic in 2020. It’s mainly funded by the Poynter Institute whose funders include Facebook and Google. Its team of fact checkers are comprised of journalists and journalism students.</p>
<p>Snopes</p>
<p>Started in 1994 by David Mikkelson Snopes is one of the first fact checking organisations. When it comes to funding, it claims “We are almost entirely funded through programmatic digital advertising sales, paid memberships, direct contributions, and merchandise sales.” However, Facebook is listed as a funder in previous years. 'Fact' checking is carried out by its team of journalists.</p>
<p>NewsGuard</p>
<p>NewsGuard is a for-profit organisation originally set up to rate websites trustworthiness in the form of ‘nutrition’ labels. It too has turned its attention to the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. It's revenue  “...comes from Internet Service Providers, browsers, search engines and social platforms paying to use NewsGuard’s ratings and Nutrition Labels in the news feeds and search results that they provide to their customers.”. They also use journalists to award website nutrition labels and undertake fact checking.</p>
<p>Full Fact</p>
<p>Full Fact is a UK based registered charity whose funders include Facebook, Google and Luminate (which was founded by Pierre Omidyar, the founder of ebay). They state they’re “…independent of government, political parties and the media”. Its fact-checkers are predominantly from a journalistic background.</p>
<p>FactCheck.org</p>
<p>US based FactCheck.org’s main focus has been the political forum, but like other 'fact-checking' organisations, it has now entered the coronavirus misinformation arena. This has led it to accepting funding from both Facebook &amp; Google to cover Covid in 2020. Its 'fact' checkers are predominantly journalists.</p>
<p>Infotagion</p>
<p>This new kid on the block, based in the UK, was created specifically to combat coronavirus misinformation, by UK Member of Parliament, Damian Collins. Funded mainly by a variety of policitians worldwide, they do not share who is undertaking the fact checking. They are the only organisation that declare they fact check against information provided by the World Health Organization along with UK and other official government advice.</p>

        <p>Note to u/tarkay and the other people in this discussion: I see a note on the original post saying that it has been removed by the moderators of  r/NoNewNormal.</p>
<p>Not being one of those mods, I couldn't tell you why they did that - on brief examination, I can't see anything that would justify the removal. Sorry to have to be the bearer of bad tidings, but thought you'd want to know.</p>

        <p>I was just sitting here thinking I had never heard of this site before.  Thanks for doing the leg work.</p>
<p>As for those of you downvoting, you can be sceptical of covid measures and demand high quality data sources at the same time, they're not mutually exclusive.  Don't down vote someone for pointing out that you may be looking at junk.  It doesn't help the cause.</p>
