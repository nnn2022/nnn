    <strong>CDC is Making me Mad!</strong>
    <p><p>I work at a bakery and office supply store. At the bakery, the masks are back on for employees, but at the office supply store, we are still "naked faced" which is fine by me. I am worried about it getting bad again. Also, I found out that vaccinated can spread it as well, so I wonder if the J&amp;J that I got back in March will work? The CDC says one thing one day, and another the next day.  Why can't they make up their mind?  I am beginning to think the CDC wants to control us instead use the more common sense approach like they did in the past during the bird flu, SARS, and the swine flu back in 2008 or whenever that was.</p>
<p>I think they need to clean house at the CDC and bring in people with common sense.</p>
<p>Also, during the pandemic last year, eventhough I worked the whole time, used the laundrymat to do laundry and wifi, and went to Walmart just to "get out;" I got real depressed during the lockdown almost to the point of suicide, because I couldn't visit with relatives or see anyone outside of work. No one wanted to go out. If another lockdown happens again, I will be protesting. You can mask if you need to, but I am 100% against government forced lockdowns. I don't trust the government, or this current administration. Biden should have banned travel to and from India a long time ago when Delta cropped up there and close our southern border but didn't. This is Biden's fault that we are in this mess! I also noticed the price of everything including gasoline has skyrocketed in the last six months as well as our crime rates.</p>
<p>Now Biden is threatening more restrictions!  I don't believe this!  I thought this was over!</p></p>

        <p>Greetings, you have joined the <em>real</em> woke people. </p>
<p>BTW, you nailed it with this: "<em>I am beginning to think the CDC wants to control us</em> "</p>
<p>So does the Obama/Harris/Biden-figurehead administration. Don't forget, through their educational arm, the NEA, they have blessed M****ism (CRT) in all American classrooms now. Via CRT, our youth will be conditioned at an early age to accept being controlled and being part of the collective.</p>
<p>We are being locked down, and conditioned to live in perpetual fear of the next COVID surge, so that our new government can continue implementing its harmful (to we the people) policies without our interference.</p>

        <p>Well, I didn't comply with the last lockdown.  I went to essential businesses just to get out and did most of my business in person.  More people in my area died of heroin overdoses than the virus, and the lockdown did nothing but hurt the economy.  People need to see each other, and there is no way I will comply if there is another lockdown.  We have a right to see friends and relatives if we want to.  We have a right to go to the mall, play cards, see the movies.  Biden is threatening another lockdown  "right now" on the news!  So yes, he does want to control us.  I also assume that he overseas the CDC, and  I don't trust Fauchi either and wonder if he is in cahoots with China.  I may be wrong there.  I want 45 back as President.  He helped the economy, saved the working class a lot in taxes, and did something about violent crime.</p>

        <p>This Is A Lie. We are at the point where it's about control. The government doesn't give a shit about your health. Anyone who doesn't see this by now has completely lost the plot. Think about this, they are telling you hospitals are full, there are no beds available but they are firing healthcare workers who aren't getting the shot? Does that make sense at all? Think about all the things that don't make sense. And don't accept bulshit answers to things that don't explain things.</p>

        <p>Tell me about it!  2022 or 2024 can't come around fast enough!  A housecleaning at the Whitehouse is six months overdue!  One thing I don't agree with is forced medical care.  It is between patient and Dr. on medical decisions, not the sticky hand of the government.  </p>
<p>It doesn't make sense that if beds are full, and they are firing healthcare workers!  Also, if they are firing healthcare workers just because of not getting the shot, and if they can't hire anymore staff,  then what?  You will have a short staffed hospital.  This has gone WAY too far!</p>

        <p>There is no novel virus. Vaxed are spreading illness via transfection/shedding and they themselves are getting sick. They can make unvaxed sick but not as severely as themselves. The vaxed received a bioweapon.</p>
