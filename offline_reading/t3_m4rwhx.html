    <strong>2020 a Culling</strong>
    <p><p>I just wanted to remind everyone to check on your family in Nursing Homes. People have been BANNED from visiting family in nursing homes since the beginning of Covid yet the number of deaths IN nursing homes are insanely high. NY had over 15K Nursing Home Deaths they had to start burying people in mass graves and renting freezer trucks for body storage. Michigan is possibly even worse. Now for the part you DONT see.</p>
<p>Some Nursing homes even here in Texas have set up "Covid units" which are hallways that are taped off usually with big sheets of plastic. The nursing home residents IN the Covid units have to stay in the room without coming out. Employees wear masks and gowns etc. That may sound like a good thing but here's the flip.
Some Nursing Homes have a rule where if the Nursing Home patient LEAVES the nursing home for any reason they have to go to the Covid unit for 2 weeks.</p>
<p>For example... Let's say your Granny stays in a nursing home and has a fall and hit her head and they call an ambulance to take her to the ER to be checked out. The ER will give her a covid test. Turns out she's fine and shows negative for Covid. She then gets returned to the nursing home but is taken to the "Covid unit" automatically for 2 weeks. Well the thing is she's going to have a much higher possibility of catching Covid if she's ON the Covid unit and not sick. After 2 weeks the patient is then returned to the general population of the nursing home. So if the patient DID manage to get Covid while on the Covid unit they would then be freely spreading it like a hardcore flu through the rest of the nursing home. When I brought this up at a local nursing home that it seems it would promote spread I was told they had "lost" about a dozen residents but they were following the companies Covid orders. To me it seems more like a culling...</p>
<p>I've brought this up several times to people that it seems backwards but it's fallen of deaf ears. I recommended emptying out an ENTIRE nursing home and using it ONLY for Covid positive patients and when they're better they could be returned. Like what was supposed to happen with the USS Mercy in NY.
Just to give you an idea imagine that MOST nursing homes are following this outline in every county... In every state all over the US. Do you think it would cause an increase in deaths?</p></p>

        <p>What they did is went out to an already-existing mass graveyard that is used for poor and homeless people called "Potter's Field" on Hart Island.</p>
<p>Every week, prisoners bury a few dozen homeless people there. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=potter%27s+field+hart+island+burial+1970s&amp;t=ffab&amp;iar=images&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images">They have been doing that for ages.</a></p>
<p>The difference is that now they could take a picture and say "<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=covid+mass+graves+nyc&amp;t=ffab&amp;iar=images&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images">Covid bodies being loaded into a mass grave</a>" if any of the coffins contains a Covid victim.</p>

        <p>this!  that was an early clue that fear was being peddled.   also, the doubtless recitations of “2 weeks to flatten the curve” as the entry point, which was forgotten and has now become what we now see which has nothing to do with that early idea of avoiding healthcare “collapse” ... fml with this waking nightmare</p>

        <p>I think the most likely explanation is nursing homes were greedy and allowed a lot of their elderly residents to die from neglect, cheaper medication changes, and lack of care. I’m not convinced they all died of covid. Many nursing homes take their patients off their prescribed medications and give them cheaper ones to make a daily profit since Medicare/Medicaid/insurance pays them a flat fee per person per day. The lower they get their expenditures, the more money they make. Nursing homes do not care about their patients. Now they face no liability in the deaths due to the covid panacea which is a recipe for greed and disaster. Most nursing homes are run by large holding companies, conglomerates, and private equity firms; their business is profiteering off of death and dying. Compound that with families and friends unable to check in with their loved ones due to covid restrictions. I think the real scandal is that the PTB let these nursing home residents die, and counted their deaths as covid in April to lead to the mass hysteria and lockdowns nationwide over covid. Without those high death numbers, none of the panic and fear mongering was justified in the slightest. And if everyone knew the deaths and “mass graves” were nursing home patients who were just one missed or wrong medication dose, untreated infection, missed dialysis,  or one strong wind from blowing over anyway, there wouldn’t have been compliance with the agenda. </p>
<p>In my opinion, the mass graves were dead nursing home patients who didn’t have families to claim their bodies (not uncommon in New York City elderly and nursing home residents). Without the high death numbers in New York, none of the nationwide lockdowns were justified. </p>
<p>I was living in NYC when the pandemic hit, but left late April when things started to get violent but before the protests. I never heard excessive sirens, saw anyone cough or keel over, and I went outside and to the store everyday just for normalcy. The situation I saw was not akin to what my friends and relatives all over the country were calling and texting me and freaking out about. They all thought I was going to end up in a mass grave. Everyday the city sends bodies to potter’s field, and I think this Hart Island thing is an offshoot of that. There are unheard of numbers of elderly and disabled New Yorkers who pass on and have no families to claim them or care. It’s just the type of people who live in the city long term and the lifestyle.</p>
