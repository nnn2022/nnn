    <strong>Trump and the New Normal</strong>
    <p><p>I don't think Trump can or will stop the New Normal, but he might just ruin civil rights for transgender people. Honestly no politician can stop this, but again they can make things much worse for certain people and if you don't care about that, I guess you don't care about me or any of the transgender people in America. By no means am I saying that you should have voted Biden. All I'd ask is that you'd stand against anything that the people in power do to single out or discriminate against trans people just like you stand against unjust and unfair public health mandates. I would ask that with no intention of vote-shaming and regardless of political affiliation.</p></p>

        <p>Look, you have every right to care about whatever issues you want to care about. You, however, don’t have the right to tell us that we HAVE to care about your issues. It’s asinine to think that morality and goodness and what’s “right” is a black and white issue. </p>
<p>You saying that a vote for trump says that people don’t care about you or other transgender people, with the implication being that it makes people bad for not having your issues be something they consider when voting, is immoral in its own way. It rejects the notion that people have the right to their opinion and interests, and it rejects that individuals come from differing backgrounds and socio-economic situations. What I care about as a white woman struggling to make ends meet is very different than what you care about, or any other minority or ethnic and marginalized group.</p>
<p>My concerns that affect my direct reality influence my opinion and my vote. As does yours. </p>
<p>This notion of “intersectionality” and needing to care about all marginalized people’s issues is incredibly myopic and forgets that each of those marginalized groups often have competing interests. What happens when blacks and Jews have racial tensions — whose side do you pick? What makes one side more moral than the other? Is it the degree of perceived oppression or is it the actual moral value of the issue? And that’s just one of many issues with what you’re asking of people here.</p>
<p>I also don’t think Biden gives a shit about your civil rights as a transgender person. So I don’t see how voting Biden ensures that you will be able to live in peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>Many people here are one issue voters — ending lockdowns. You also are clearly a one issue voter, as you are voting for the candidate you view as protecting your rights as a transgender person. Even if trump can’t stop the new normal as you say, he has expressed zero desire to make the new normal be a thing at the national and federal level. And you should know that there are more than a few people here who couldn’t stomach voting for trump, even if they thought he’d save us, and chose to use this election as a way to bring forth other parties to the table by voting third party. Which is a good thing for democracy going forward. The more people who are open to voting third party, the more viable a third party actually becomes.</p>

        <p>No but you implied it. You essentially said, “I hope none of you voted for trump because he will take away my rights.” Which even though you said you weren’t trying to shame people for their vote, you kinda are doing that by making that statement.</p>
<p>And of course it’s possible to care about both. But right now, all a lot of people give a shit about is getting their freedom back. And what that means is that unfair mandates take precedence over your issue. </p>
<p>Would I support your rights as a transgender person? Of course. I’m your typical liberal Democrat. Do I care about this issue right now? Absolutely not. All I give a shit about right now is ending government infringement and overreach, of ending gubernatorial dictatorships, of ending all lockdowns and any future ability for government to institute that. It literally eats at me every day and I obsess about this nightmare ending. And plus, the side affect of not having government in your life as much is that people like trump won’t be able to curtail your rights as a transgender person. So it actually is to your benefit to support any candidate that says they want to end lockdowns. Which is why a vote for trump isn’t necessarily a vote against you; In fact, it may benefit you down the road.</p>

        <p>Wait how will voting for Trump be to my benefit in the long run if it's made legal to discriminate based on religion in health care? I'm not vote shaming anybody simply asking for support for a certain group and the rights of said group no matter who gets elected. I would ask for the same support if Biden and the dems turned around and tried to curtail those rights too.</p>

        <p>Ok that’s fair. And you have every right to ask that people support your cause.</p>
<p>But what I meant was that because Trump has basically said he wants there to be less government control in our lives, then him being president would make sure that a president can’t legislate on this issue. If anything, your beef would be in the courts and maybe the state legislatures of different states.</p>
<p>So while trump represents bigotry toward transgender people, if he curtails the power of the president, then you benefit from that down the line.</p>

        <p>Ok i do understand where you're coming from there. I definitely agree with less government control especially over people's bodies and minds. Thank you for hearing me out about this and not being like some people in this sub. I honestly don't want Biden to win or Trump to win. I wish there was a better option but we live in the two party framework unfortunately.</p>

        <p>Your welcome, of course! I apologize for coming off so hostile right off the bat. I was just triggered by the language in the original post because it sounded a lot like some of my friends in real life who are super woke and immediately shut down nuanced discussion by saying that having my own issues I care about, is somehow wrong and I have to care about what they decided is the right and moral thing to care about. That to me is a kind of oppression I have no interest in.</p>
<p>And honestly, even though some people may be immediately dismissive of what you wrote here, I do think that this sub is great in that you do have such a variety of political opinions here and yet people can come together and be rational about things. We may not all agree on all issues, but it’s nice that this little corner of Reddit (and all the other lockdown skeptical subs) feels like one of the last good places for rational discourse on the internet.</p>

I may be trans, but I am also a citizen of the USA, and I need to be more concerned about what affects more people.

        <p>Would you say that after being denied health care you need based on your identity? Would you say that if an emboldened transphobic individual attacks you? It seems noble and all but its a very big risk to be taking especially since your local government could easily still impose restrictions based on Covid.</p>

        <p>I already don't get health care, if someone wants to attack me let them come, and my local government has already implemented a curfew and mandated masks in public at all times, just a couple of days ago. And Biden wants to make a national mask mandate, so local restrictions aren't much of a concern if he wins.</p>
<p>I won't pretend that I speak for all trans people, but sacrifices must be made in order to ensure we have a shot at a better future. Even if we take a step back now, it can ensure we can take two steps forward later. Trump has to win.</p>

<p>1: Trump has not removed medical insurance for trans people. (Evidenced by the fact that trans people still have medical insurance.) As such there is no grounded reason to believe that he WILL remove it.</p>

I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings or whatever, I was just echoing a lot of the worries of your and my community, but I guess those fears are totally unfounded and we're all just sheep or whatever. Thanks for being incredibly hostile toward someone who's going through the same stuff as you. </p>
<p>And you can be trans and be military but not if you have gender dysphoria, which like 90 percent of trans ppl are diagnosed with? Sounds like bunk to me.</p>

        <p>I despise Trump (but hope he wins - I voted for Jorgensen) and Trump obviously does not care about law or justice - but I'm not sure why you are particularly worried about him going after transgender people.</p>

        <p>Mostly because of Mike Pence and his crew, along with a lot of his LGBT support being mostly centered around gay ppl but not trans ppl. </p>

<p>Some of the stuff in the link is kinda meh but that just looks like a lot of bias against trans ppl 8n particular</p>
