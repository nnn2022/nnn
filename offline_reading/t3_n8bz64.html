    <strong>What is the most illogical thing that 'The Unenlightened' have said to you about the so-called vaccines?</strong>
    <p><p>We are fully aware that the biggest scam - after the RT-PCR cycle threshold^(INFINITY) scandal - is the idea that \~80% of C19+ people are asymptomatic spreaders. </p>
<p>Whenever I inform The Unenlightened^(TM) that I am not getting a C19 pseudovaccine under ANY circumstance, they immediately respond (predictably) with the "It reduces the chances that you will get severe C19 disease" and "It will make you less likely to develop symptoms like sneezing and coughing and if you are not showing symptoms, you are less likely to transmit the infection" banal talking points.</p>
<p>What throws me for a loop is the fact that The Unenlightened^(TM) can suggest that one should get an experimental gene therapy that INCREASES one's probability of being an AsYmPtOmAtIc SpReAdEr whilst simultaneously believing that AsYmPtOmAtIc SpReAd is the main driver of the disease. When I expose their Orwellian Doublethink/cognitive dissonance, they immediately 'glitch,' have a BSOD-event and REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEboot.</p>
<p>This is what we are up against: people who REFUSE to think beyond what they are told to think by the MSM.</p></p>

        <p>One redditor insisted that I was misunderstanding the directive on classifying covid deaths. I had linked him to an article:</p>
<p>https://denver.cbslocal.com/2020/12/15/grand-county-covid-deaths/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter</p>
<p>\&rt; The Grand County coroner is calling attention to the way the state health department is classifying some deaths. The coroner, Brenda Bock, says two of their five deaths related to COVID-19 were people who died of gunshot wounds.</p>
<p>They said, the coroner misunderstood the directive and was not qualified to speak on it...</p>

        <p>I told my sister about how (might be slightly off on remembering these statistics) only 6% of the covid deaths were ONLY from covid, and that the other 94% had at least 2 co-morbidities. I said to her, "The majority of these people are obese or have diabetes or things like that, and they are being counted as covid deaths." </p>
<p>She said, "Well, it sounds like they were still living with these conditions before they got covid and covid is what killed them so that's not wrong." </p>
<p>Ughhhhh. I couldn't get through to her about this. She wasn't seeing the forest for the trees. They were/are hyping up the severity of covid by an insane amount, was my point. We were both two college-aged, healthy people having this conversation while in fucking lockdown. I don't think I was the idiot in this situation.</p>

        <p>I don't even consider myself very smart. Academically, my sister even excels more than I do in many ways. My father barely graduated high school, he's just always been skeptical of authority and seen enough in his life to feel this way. </p>
<p>I've been starting to think, and I'm sure you would agree, that this goes beyond intelligence and more to do with personality type and how much you value your social standing. </p>
<p>My sister and I were very similarly socially awkward and shy as children. As we grew up, I can now see we tackled these issues in different ways. Whereas, I got to such a point of "rock bottom" of social humiliation and anxiety that I was able to realize "That was as worse as it can get and I didn't die. I'm going to be okay." That experience eventually gave me kind of an "IDGAF" attitude that made me confident and accepting of who I am. </p>
<p>My sister seems to have approached the challenge of social anxiety by turning herself into a social pleaser and essentially not even being herself around others. She wants se badly to be accepted by others that she just appeases to what she thinks they want. I hate to say it, but I just don't believe that she just does much "thinking for herself" at this point. Her social standing is more valued. </p>
<p>I have lost a lot of friends during this pandemic due to my beliefs. My sister has kept all of her previous friends and goes along with whatever.</p>

        <p>This saga has never been about intelligence: it's about critical thinking and being able to have a memory that can recall the ExPeRtZ guidance from just a week prior (SETTLED SCIENZ^(TM) changes every other day, so a week is ample time.)</p>
<p>Yes, many people are joining the hivemind because it's the path of least resistance and is socially acceptable. It takes courage to reject the narrative and form one's opinions.</p>

        <p>The most unenlightened thing I've heard is people refusing to take the vaccines because they are afraid that the mild side effects such as headaches, fever for a day, etc in most or extreme side effects in 1 in a million such as blood clots make the vaccine not worth taking and a better choice to risk getting covid with its side effects include pretty much all the side effects the vaccine has, but with a far greater impact, and adds lasting damage to the lungs, heart, brain, and worldwide mass death of millions on top of it.   Its like people forgot to put all variables into the equation when analyzing  risk, and while the vaccine isn't risk free, its certainly far less riskier than not taking the vaccine from ANY measure.  Its like people refusing to wear seatbelts which save many lives in most cases, because of the extremely rare freak cases where they trap people in cars.</p>

        <p>You forgot to mention how you're now a spike protein making factory without an off switch after the experimental gene therapy (not a vaccine). If you manage to escape a heart attack, or stroke you're not out of the woods yet. With a compromised immune system similar to an A.I.D.S patient, and flu season around corner waiting on you, I'd like to take the time to wish you good luck. Skip synthetic isolated nutrients from an unregulated supplement market, and eat real food that contain vitamin d, and zinc. Organic beef liver, pasture raised eggs, grass fed beef, wild caught salmon etc.</p>

<p>RNAse enzymes are the "off switch" for all mRNA. It's ubiquitous, found in all cells, extracellular fluid and in the environment (bacteria and fungi produce RNAse as well), and rapidly degrades mRNA.  The virus itself injects your cells with the same plus more mRNA strands coding for other viral proteins, along with RNA replicase allowing replication of these strands specifically to get around the "off switch" you think doesn't exist. Also how is it "gene therapy" considering RNA is physically not able to integrate with chromosomal DNA? You do realize that DNA and RNA are different molecules with different structure and function right?</p>

        <p>How on earth did 8 billion people not die before the pseudovaccines were rushed and jammed into the arteries of the unwise and medically ill-informed? It's almost as if healthy people who don't have lifestyle-caused comorbidities can fight off this virus without batting an eyelid.

        <p>You can think of good health and the vaccine both as variables in the equation to help with the coronavirus pandemic.  Have both if possible, but good health is something that takes time, while the vaccine you can literally do in 30 minutes.  So it is crucial to stopping the pandemic, especially when many people, myself included, don't have good health.  I'm fully aware that my bad choices caused my bad health, but I have poor self control, and am in no way promoting it as healthly, like you and many other people here are doing with your anti vax view.  When it comes to the vaccine, do as I did, get the vaccine.  When it comes to overall weight management and general health, do as I say, not as I do, because I clearly lack willpower.</p>

        <p>You're entitled to get as many jabs as you desire, u/Glen4321. Just do not expect someone to get a jab for your health (remember: these jabs do NOT prevent transmission) when you have not made an iota of effort to be healthy. That's unreasonable for you to ask people to inject experimental gene therapies into their bodies to make you feel safe when you literally can't be bothered to be healthy.</p>

        <p>For awhile it was unknown if the vaccines prevented transmission, but now we know they do, and by quite a significant amount.  <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22291959/covid-vaccines-transmission-protect-spread-virus-moderna-pfizer">https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22291959/covid-vaccines-transmission-protect-spread-virus-moderna-pfizer</a></p>

<p>And its not about me.   Even at 300 lb, I'd probably survive the virus, because I just had a doctor visit and am in general good health overall despite the weight (I have no other vices) and am only in my 30s.  Therefore, even with my weight, my survival odds are quite good.  Other people are in much worse conditions, and some can't even get the vaccine because of their health.  We should all take the vaccine if possible for their health.</p>

        <p>Covid probably isn't going away with about a 30% vaccine hesitation rate, and it may be we have to accept certain amounts of risk and carry on with society if that happens, and stop certain social distancing measures, because we can't do that forever.  That said, these policy are completely irrelevant to if you should take the vaccine, which you should, because its very effective.  You can take the vaccine and not support every anti-covid measure politicians make who don't take into account all negative externalities of their decisions.  After all, politicains are far from experts on health.</p>

        <p>" What a great analogy that is not logically fallacious because it's a  well-known fact that your seatbelt prevents others from getting hurt in  the event of a car crash. "  The covid vaccine signifigantly lowers the odds of someone transmitting the virus to other people who may not be able to take the vaccine.  That risk is probably far greater than someone killing someone else from a car wreck without a seatbelt, considering about 10 times as many people died from Covid over the past year as car wrecks last year in USA.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>" How on earth did 8 billion people not die before the pseudovaccines were  rushed and jammed into the arteries of the unwise and medically  ill-informed?  "   Many didn't survive. 3 million have died worldwide from COVID.  many more died from previous pandemics.  Before vaccines, herd immunity was usually achieved through many people dying.   Science and medicine have prevented a lot of that, and average life expectancy has about doubled over the past 300 years.  Anti vaccers and other anti science people put this progress at risk.  I agree with you other health factors play a part in people's ability to survive covid, and people should be healthy for many reasons.  I certainly fail at that being addicted to food and being 300lb, but I don't promote that as a healthy lifestyle.  I am in the wrong there.  But that is completely irrelevant to if the vaccine is the logical option for 98% of the adult population (and eventually children as the vaccine becomes cleared for them) which it is.</p>

        <p>A. Prove it.</p>
<p>B. Even if true, is still far less risky than not taking it and risking the virus which has killed over 3 million.  The decision to take the vaccine doesn't exist in a bubble.  If nothing happened if you didn't take the vaccine, I'd agree, don't take it.  Because why have unneeded side effects?  But its the decision to take the vaccine and its side effects, verses not taking it and having a far greater risk of catching coronavirus and all its exponentially worse side effects up to mass worldwide death.   Sorry, but the logical decision is to take the vaccine.  Taking the vaccine is like making a decision between being punched by a 5 year old (the vaccine) or being punched by Mike Tyson in 1987 with no padding (The Coronavirus).  It may not feel good to be punched by a 5 year old, but I would question the sanity of anyone who would choose the latter.</p>

        <p>My life has been relatively unchanged, as well.  I don’t know where you live, but churches here began meeting again in June of 2020.  Mask orders are lifted, events are raising capacity every month.  </p>
<p>I took vaccine, not bc I was told to, or even bc I think it will do any good. I took it because I just don’t want to hear about it anymore, and I assume that at some point it’s going to expected.  I’m not scared of the virus, I’m not scared of the vaccine. If it kills me, it kills me.  Oh well.  </p>

        <p>I don’t think there’s any evidence to support that this vaccine will be any more dangerous than any of the other vaccines I’ve had.  Sorry, I will it mitt that there is an unknown factor, but I highly doubt that I will see any problems arise from it. If I’m wrong, I’m wrong. But I’m not going to go Hide in a basement. If this helps fast forward the world back to normal, I’m more than happy to do it.  It just strikes me that most people that are against the vaccine are the same people that are always ready for the world to end and some catastrophe to happen, and a lot of them are Q anon, so I just really don’t put a lot of credence into the things I’m hearing from the chicken Littles.</p>

        <p>There’s not any long-term studies. I basically just said that there was an unknown factor. You’re just the type of person that needs something to rage against and this is what you’re coming down.

        <p>So what makes you think there won't be any serious long term health effects if there hasn't been any long term studies? </p>
<p>Nah, I'm not gonna give in to an authoritarian government and jeopardize my health so that same corrupt government can tell me I'm allowed to do the things I never stopped doing. That's some Stockholm Syndrome, weak-minded bullshit. That's communist China thinking. People like you are the driving factor that's turning a once free nation into a dystopian shithole.</p>

        <p>No, I know I'm an idiot, but it doesn't take a genius to know it's unwise to take such a sketchy therapeutic. And you are wrong, I actually care about my health, I don't eat trash, which is why I don't need a vaccine (that doesn't prevent transmission by the way) to protect me from a mild virus. I guess we'll see who is right in the next year, I'll see how you're doing next spring lol</p>

        <p>&rt; But I’m not going to go Hide in a basement. If this helps fast forward the world back to normal, I’m more than happy to do it.</p>
<p>Why would that be the only solution you can think of?</p>
<p>I mean, sure if you dont see anything sinister or actually see good (like  health/solidarity) in it, go ahead. But, if the only reason you took it because you want this whole thing to end, despite disagreeing with what happens or rather how........</p>

        <p>Doctors are getting it.  Nurses are getting it. Firemen are getting it.  Society is fucked already if it kills all of us who get it, so you’re not going to be inheriting much of a civilization if you’re right, so I’m fine with my decision.  However, seeing as how the choices are be afraid of what might happen or help get the country back to normal, I’ll take the shot.  I don’t care if you get it or not, but pretending that you’re operating from some intellectual highground is disingenuous.  You’re just being a contrarian because you enjoy it.  You get to play rebel, and call all the others sheep, and it gives some pseudo-superiority endorphin drip.</p>

        <p>Dont get me wrong, I support your decision. </p>
<p>I just recently hear a lot of people saying they are getting it to get their "Freedoms back".</p>
<p>And if that is truly the reason, I cant but shake my head. If you take it because you believe it helps you, helps herd immunity, helps others, all fine by me. But if its only to comply... its... I dont find the right words to describe how it makes me feel.</p>
