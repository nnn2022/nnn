    <strong>Never Again, Again, Again, Again! - "German spies monitor anti-lockdown activists for suspected sedition."</strong>
    <p><p>After the unfettered surveillance of domestic populations by Nazi Germany's Gestapo (Geheime Staatspolizei) and SD (Sicherheitsdienst des Reichsführers-SS), and East Germany's Stasi ( Staatssicherheitsdiens) -  <strong><em>für Ihre Sicherheit</em></strong>, of course - Germany's BfV (Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz) is spying on mUh SeDiTiOnIsTz.   </p>
<p>LINK:  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/german-spies-monitor-anti-lockdown-activists-suspected-sedition-2021-04-28/">German spies monitor anti-lockdown activists for suspected sedition | Reuters</a> </p>
<p>Yes, wanting an end to pointless and ultra-destructive lockdowns is tantamount to sedition because you are an anti-Semitic, far-right extremist, C19 denying, violent conspiracy theorist who is a major threat to public health. Why wouldn't the government want to protect its citizens by spying on insurrectionists who want to subvert the rule of law? The government will never abuse its powers because it's learnt from its past mistakes and has assured us that "this time is different."</p>
<p>&rt;Germany's domestic spy agency is monitoring individuals who have joined anti-lockdown protests to decide if their rejection of government curbs amounts to subversion and incitement to violence.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The surveillance includes some members of the "Querdenker" or "Lateral Thinkers" movement, which has been organising increasingly violent protests against coronavirus lockdowns and includes conspiracy theorists and suspected far-right extremists, a spokeswoman for the BfV spy agency said.<br>
....<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt; Authorities fear that far-right extremists and conspiracy theorists who either deny the existence of COVID-19 or downplay its threat to public health are exploiting lockdown frustrations to stir anger against politicians and state institutions five months before a general election.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;"Legitimate protests against the coronavirus politics are being repeatedly and increasingly exploited to provoke an escalation," said BfV spokeswoman Angela Pley.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;"Organisers of demonstrations which are mainly led by protagonists of the Querdenker movement have an agenda that goes beyond protesting against the state's measures against the coronavirus."<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;She added that members of the far-right "Reichsbuerger" movement that denies the existence of the modern German state as well as anti-Semitic groups have participated in the protests.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Domestic spies fear far-right extremists could seek to boost anger against state institutions such as the police after parliament gave temporary powers this month to Chancellor Angela Merkel's government to enforce lockdowns in areas with high infection rates.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The new powers have drawn fierce criticism from opposition parties, including the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, whose leaders have joined anti-lockdown protests.<br>

        <p>I love how they refer to the protests as "increasing violent" while failing to mention it is the security forces initiating the violence...</p>

        <p>Sorry, deleted the post because it was unflaired. I reposted it.</p>
<p>Man, Reuters is just junk. They'd never suggest that the government and its policies were bad. It's always the fault of the alt-right.</p>
