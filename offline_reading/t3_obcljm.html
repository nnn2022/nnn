        <p>1) Nothing is free.  We'll pay for everything sooner or later with taxes or inflation.</p>
<p>2) If the government wanted to spend money towards increasing lifespan of Americans, it would focus on something like cancer that commonly kills children rather than a cold with an average age of death of 79. Cancer screening tents would have been much more effective.  And chemotherapy is much less toxic than mRNA for spike proteins.</p>

        <p>The united states, as a country, would prefer to have living, working, productive citizens. Even ignoring the death rate, the sheer hospitalization rates are terrifying, to say the least.</p>
<p>Nothing is free, which is why cancer research is usually funded by philanthropy, and by that I mean <em>charity you absolute knob.</em> There's no lack of people who donate, which is how all that is paid.</p>
<p>Toxic is an interesting word. Adam Conover had an interesting segment about how that word could mean nearly anything dependent on the circumstances, including but not limited to fiber, protein, and water. However, do you know what chemotherapy is? It's using radiation to kill off sections of the human body that have been lost to cancer. Even if it can be targeted, radiation is, by nature, a ray, meaning it'll always affect other parts of the body in some small way. On the other hand, mRNA pretends to be a virus enough for the immune system to do its job and build up immunity, allowing it to be more prepared for when an actual virus arrives.</p>
<p>Chemotherapy might not be considered toxic because it is not a substance, it a process. On the other hand, have you ever <em>seen</em> anyone who's gone through chemotherapy? Like, seriously, have you ever met someone in person who's lost all their hair, who has patchy skin, who's body has atrophied in nearly every aspect? If you did, would you still think that chemotherapy is less harmful than the vaccine?</p>
<p>I lost family to cancer. Cancer has yet to have a cure. Covid has a cure. I will not lose family to covid. Will you?</p>

<p>yes, and this whole thing would have been over one year ago if some specific group of people wouldn't have systematically blocked HCQ and ivermectin, which were both available, both cheap and both known to be effective against CoViD.</p>
<p>It is time to hold the people responsible who blocked this solely because of their political agenda, because they didn't like Trump. They deserve the death penalty and reading your posts, i see that you agree.</p>

<p>Americans are paying more in taxes alone towards healthcare. </p>
<p>With government in the US covering <a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2015.302997">64.3% of all health care</a> costs (<a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/highlights.pdf">$11,072 as of 2019</a>) that's $7,119 per person per year in taxes towards health care. The next closest is Norway at <a href="https://data.oecd.org/healthres/health-spending.htm">$5,673</a>. The UK is $3,620. Canada is $3,815. Australia is $3,919. That means over a lifetime Americans are paying a minimum of $113,786 more in taxes compared to any other country towards health care. </p>
<p>In total, Americans are paying a quarter million dollars more for healthcare over a lifetime compared to the most expensive socialized system on earth. Half a million dollars more than countries like Canada and the UK. </p>
<p>&rt;Why are you so eager for cancer patients to die? </p>
<p>You realize peer countries have better outcomes on average than the US, right?</p>

        <p>i remember reading somewhere that the vaccines weaken your body's ability to fight cancer.</p>
<p>fun fact: from 1955-63 (8 years), polio vaccines were contaminated with cancer causing SV40. decades later, people had cancer tumors that were SV40 positive. </p>
<p>back to the covid vaccines, i wonder if the intention was to weaken the populaces immune systems or prime them for a later killshot.</p>

        <p>My mother is undergoing chemo now (breast cancer). $52k per chemo treatment. She is going to have 12 rounds. And yet today I see that Biden is going after the makers of the new drug that reportedly helps Alzheimer’s patients because the cost is so high? The annual cost is less than 1 chemo treatment……unbelievable!</p>

        <p>Well gee, it's almost as if we're looking for the cure for cancer. Like, constantly. After all that bashing of a treatment that hasn't been tested, now you're asking for one? I mean, I hear hydroxychloroquine has some health effects if you get your medical advice for an inflatable bobblehead.</p>
<p>Also, cancer can't easily be transmitted to anyone in a radius of six feet. If it started spreading exponentially, there would probably be more outcry about it.</p>
<p>Who the actual fuck thinks there isn't any media outcry about cancer. There is, and will continue to be until it's cured. Name ten charities, three of them will probably involve treating and researching cancer, if not more.</p>
<p>Go donate to cancer research if you're so worried.</p>

        <p>It makes a difference in how you deal with it.</p>
<p>I do care, and I live in a country in which an individual's health is financed by all tax payers. If I had cancer, I'd only have to fear dying. If the average American has cancer, they also have to fear surviving because of the financial backlash.</p>

<p>Don't you think it's odd that they're paying for this untested vaccine that's putting people into the hospital and into early graves for a virus that ran its course a year ago, but won't pay for any of the other treatments for things that actually ARE killing so many people?</p>
<p>Does that make sense for the American healthcare system?</p>

        <p>Those two things do not corelate IMO.</p>
<p>It is not odd that we fight an ongoing pandemic.</p>
<p>It is odd, that Americans can't figure out a health care system that does not ruin a cancer patients life if he/she survives cancer.</p>
<p>Two seperate things. That's my point.</p>

        <p>Ongoing?  Because the media says so?</p>
<p>No virus in the history of mankind has ever gotten more deadly with each new variant.  It has never ever happened. </p>
<p>Viruses don't work that way.  They never have ad they never will.  It just doesn't happen.  Ever.</p>
<p>You're being lied to.   Covid is not getting more deadly.</p>
<p>It ran its course a year ago and stopped.  It's over now.   It's the common cold at worst.</p>
<p>It's done.  It was never ever deadly to young people.  It was only a threat to really old and the sick and dying.</p>
<p>The largest Amish community of 40,000 people only lost 1 person to covid and that person was already dying.  They never stopped living a normal life.</p>

        <p>What credible sources do you have to back that claim that viruses don't work that way?</p>
<p>I do not fear dying of covid. I am young and healthy, the chances of me dying due to covid are very small.
There are two other issues about it that concern my:</p>
<p>1) long covid syndrome - I know a few people around my age that still suffer even though they are covid free for months.</p>
<p>2) health care systems nearly collapsing because of rapidly increasing demands. Most health care systems are designed in a way that they use 90% of their capacity in normal times. Makes sense for sure, it would be very expensive to maintain more capacity when there is no need for it. But it comes with the downside of veing overloaded easily, which did already cause issues during the pandemic. People could not get the help they needed because there was not enough equipment/workers/space for them. Not only covid patients but also people with strokes, etc. fell short sometimes. It never was abouz irradicating a virus, it always was about flattening the curve. Everything else woul just be utopic.</p>
<p>Also there are two reasons why covid was not such a big issue for most people:</p>
<p>1) we did react, wear masks, socially distance, test frequently, etc. Many countries tried different measures, some were better, others were not so good. The difference was easily spottable in the case data.</p>
<p>2) we were extremely lucky that the virus that caused the pandemic is not that deadly. It could have been way worse. Idk if you would complain as much about vaccines if it was a more deadly desease. Still covid is not to be underestimated, but because we don't see like 10% of the people dying many of us believe it is absolutely harmless.</p>

        <p>Look I'm not getting paid to give you a full education about viruses.  Unless you're going to put cash money in my account, don't expect me to do your work for you.  Teachers get paid.  Remember that.</p>
<p>Open a textbook.  Read about viruses.  Learn.  Study. </p>
<p>That's what I've been doing for a year and a half in addition to the anatomy and physiology classes I took in college well before this.   </p>
<p>I worked in a hospital during the entire pandemic and it only lasted 3 months in the state of Michigan.  Three months.  Everything was back to normal outside of the stupid rules we had in place.  The spike was over in three months.   Hospitals everywhere were turning away patients who needed standard care for things other than covid just like what happens every day in a normal day at any hospital.  But now they were all being turned away... which meant we had empty beds in empty rooms in empty hallways and larger hospitals even closed entire floors.   Staff was laid off because turning away patients who didn't have covid meant staff wasn't needed.  Nurses were taking temperatures at the door in a desperate attempt to keep their hours.  People lost money.  Hospitals went bankrupt.  THIS WAS REALITY!</p>
<p>You watch the TV man.  You never learned a damn thing except what THEY WANTED YOU TO KNOW.   And you dare to ask me to give you sources?   If you wanted to read sources, you'd have already done so long before now.</p>
<p>You don't give a shit about learning the truth.  You never did.   You're here on this sub because you want to argue and prove you're obedient to your masters.</p>
<p>Look- you have centuries of history to prove I'm right.  Go buy a textbook and read about virology before covid-19.  It's not hard.  Pay someone to be a teacher for you on the subject if you're too lazy to do the research for yourself.  Didn't anyone teach you how to find your own research?</p>
<p>Want some fun homework?  Prove me wrong.  Go find a virus that became MORE DEADLY with each new variant.  Covid doesn't count- find one BEFORE 2020.</p>
<p>Long covid does not exist.  You're talking about pneumonia.  Pneumonia is not covid.  It never has been.  Learn the difference.  Go read a textbook.   Pneumonia can come from covid, but that doesn't make it covid.  Pneumonia can be caused by a lot of things and it's been killing people for millennia.  I don't think you even know what pneumonia is, do you?   It's the number one killer of children under 5 years of age in the world.  It kills 800,000 people every single year.</p>
<p>Healthcare systems are not collapsing.  I was laid off last month but I assure you that before that time and even before and during the pandemic, I was in regular contact with people from other hospitals and even people who travel from hospital to hospital even from state to state and the healthcare system was not collapsing due to increasing covid victims.   The healthcare system was almost completely shut down by governors signing orders forcing hospitals to turn away patients because of covid rules that made no sense.</p>
<p>If hospitals had been allowed to run like they were supposed to run, it would have been a very bad flu season and would have been over in 3 months.  Everything would have been back to normal after that.   I was there.  </p>
<p>BULL SHIT - masks are bullshit.  South Dakota, Sweden, Florida, and more and more and more places around the world were and are doing just fine partying mask free in crowded rooms and in bars.</p>
<p>South Dakota in July of last year held a bike rally of 500,000 maskless tourists from all over the country and not a damn thing happened as a result.</p>
<p>Learn to think for yourself.  Stop letting yourself be lied to.</p>
<p>And for god's sake- stop demanding sources while refusing to provide your own.</p>
<p>Stop being a sheep.</p>

        <p>My dear friend, calm down, I did not want to upset you. I am interested in what you have to say, therefore I put forward my opinion.</p>
<p>What is your profession? I am not in the health care industry, i am an engineer. I do know how to research a topic, and I bet I did a lot more research on viruses than many others. I do know a few things about medicine and biology, but of course my knowledge is limited as I am not a professional in any of these areas. However I have to tell you that I certainly am a critical thinker and not what you may call a sheep. I don't watch television except for entertainment, I do not listen to radio because it bores me, I do not read articles from social or print media, and if I do I check the sources.</p>
<p>I do not want you to teach me in great lengths, I just had to question your educational background on the topic, because I wanted to evaluate how credible and legit I should value your arguments.</p>
<p>We do have to give credit to the mathematicians and epidemiologists who tried their best to inform gouverments. I agree that not every measure the politicians put in place was smart or useful, but that's just the system being not in favour of people who know their stuff but people who know how to be rhetorically clever.</p>
<p>By the way, who is "they"? And how do "they" profit from all of this? Who profits from a pandemic? Pharma industry, ok, but that's just way too many people involved for a functioning conspiracy, and too little for world wide power.</p>
