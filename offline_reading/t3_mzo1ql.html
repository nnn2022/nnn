    <strong>Pro-lockdown people are so brainwashed they won't even glance at the evidence</strong>
    <p><p>Tldr: pro-lockdown person doesn't even look at peer-reviewed studies against lockdowns, saying they're conspiracies</p>
<p>This is a paraphrased conversation I had with an old acquaintance we'll call 'A' yesterday. Background: I was at a freedom rally on the weekend and the local stores closed for the day citing the dangers of the crowd at the rally. Here in Canada we're facing harder lockdowns due to the "third wave".</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>A: That rally caused all those small businesses to close down which is the last thing they need right now.</p>
<p>Me: Yet more media-induced hysteria causing harm, our small businesses need to fight back. </p>
<p>A: You directly caused them to lose revenue by being there. Because of you they were forced to close down for their health and safety.</p>
<p>Me: Oh, you mean like the government did to them?</p>
<p>A: It's a novel virus. They needed time to figure it out.</p>
<p>Me: I understand that, but there is still zero empirical evidence that shows lockdowns work. It's been long enough. If you're interested, I have dozens of studies that show this. Just facts and data.</p>
<p>A: Wow. I'm not interested in conspiracies. Stop hurting small business.</p>
<p>Me: You aren't interested in even looking at the studies that deny the hysteria right now because you're brainwashed. Way to support science.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I feel like I'm going crazy. These people have literally abandoned all reason and logic and instead blame us for every point of suffering brought on by government intervention.</p></p>

        <p>“I have a foreboding of an America in my children's or grandchildren's time -- when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what's true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness...</p>
<p>The dumbing down of American is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30 second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance”</p>

        <p>It's because the media have told them that anybody who questions the narrative is a conspiracy theorist. </p>
<p>I had one of them trying to convince me to get the AstraZeneca jab the other day. He was adamant that, unlike Moderna and Pfizer, this one is totally safe and is a normal vaccine as it uses a killed SARS-CoV2 virus. </p>
<p>I told him that it actually uses a weakened adenovirus from a chimpanzee and he immediately called me a conspiracy theorist, despite this being common knowledge.</p>

        <p>Hey man I agree. Can’t shut people out for a different opinion, then we’re no better than the people we disagree with. </p>
<p>Do you mind linking any sources about the ineffectiveness of lockdowns? I’ve heard this said on many podcasts but I’d like to have a few legitimate links to look at and possibly use for support if they make sense. </p>
<p>Part of the problem is that anybody with the slightest question about this topic is lumped in with the people who did zero research and just blindly believe a “conspiracy” because they distrust authority/govt. Those people then
 get on social media and spout off half-ass factoids with no support or organized argument. Then they end up on r/trashy, r/insanepeoplefacebook or worse they sometimes get traction in the mainstream media (which is done only to ridicule them) and then average, level headed people in the middle only see a crazy guy on social media and an official News Anchor telling you to “do the right thing.”</p>
<p>Which would you believe? </p>
<p>So any credible, peer reviewed information must be shared. At least to show this “science” is not accepted by ALL credible scientists. I think that goes a long way with people you have in your social circles who might be willing to discuss. The internet is another story...</p>
<p>Keep it up man.</p>

        <p>Here you are! </p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/m03zoo/asymptomatic_transmission_is_exceedingly_rare/ </p>
<p>There's a thread with no less than ten studies on asymptomatic cases and how there is no spread among them. Those studies are absolutely massive and show how useless every measure is. </p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/kxj3hg/covid_facts_that_every_person_should_know_but/ </p>
<p>This thread sums up some data and interprets it to show that the media is being hysterical and our protection measures are completely wrong. </p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/khg6qs/the_real_science/ </p>
<p>And this is an older thread citing many, many studies about natural herd immunity, the lies and exaggeration of the media and governments, and the nonsense of lockdowns. </p>
<p>I haven't personally confirmed every one of these studies, but the ones I have seen are all credible and accurate. Feel free to share all of this information as best you can.</p>

        <p>It’s mostly intellectual laziness. These people don’t want to engage in critical thinking because it hurts their brain. </p>
<p>It’s a lot easier just to go along with what every one else is doing, stay home collecting coronabucks. Remember for a lot of people, no lockdowns= no free government money to stay home. By questioning lockdowns, you are threatening their income and their year- long vacation. Why would they want anything to change?</p>
