    <strong>Im banned, can someone post this in covidvaccinated</strong>
    <p><p>Feel free to modify to make it more gentle/tactful and less tempting for the mods to ban:</p>
<p>There are comments that are being deleted by the mods and users are being banned when offering a different opinion. Isn’t it important that this sub is censor-free, so people wanting to learn about potential adverse reactions can be aware? Or is this sub run by the pharma company? I’m a bit concerned that people coming on this thread aren’t being presented with all the facts they are seeking. No one should be muted, especially if it’s on topic concerning one’s health. freedom of speech.</p></p>

        <p>I've been banned from r/coronavirus, r/worldnews, r/humansbeingbros and r/covidvaccinated. Had comments deleted from r/coronavirusuk, downvoted to fuck in r/publicfreakout and r/funny.</p>
<p>All comments either regarding efficacy of masks, the point in having a vaccine with such a high survival rate and the lack of protecting against transmission. Stating that I'm sick of seeing jokes about 'anti maskers' or videos about 'maskless karens' I have never been rude in my initial posts and only reacted when people have been downright disgusting.  You know 'hope you die' 'fuck off you piece of trash' etc </p>
<p>Its straight up censorship. </p>
<p>There are thousands of people... probably millions who have these discussions privately but are too scared to say them out loud through fear of repercussions from the blind mob.</p>
<p>The Scottish protest post earlier summed it up for me.</p>
<p>The police said they will arrest you if you protest but we totally agree that you should be allowed to and my favourite, you should protest online.</p>
<p>Literally any comment that's not on here or r/conspiracy is deleted. </p>
<p>Its beyond depressing.</p>
