    <strong>The word "vaccine" is venomous.</strong>
    <p><p>Hear it with a serpant's lisp: "<em>Vaccine</em>". If that sent tingles down your spine, don't let the fool in you say that word out loud.</p>
<p>What is it about a snake bite that makes it dangerous? It's the venom that's in it. So if a man creates a venomous bite, and calls it with a serpant's tongue, how much more Satanic can you get? There's no fruit of knowledge between good and evil here, is there?</p>
<p>If you've ever heard people say "vaccine", you'll know just how stupid it normally sounds. But when that word is brought up, the conversation typically devolves into pressing questions about when everybody's getting that snake bite. That word shuts off a light in people's heads, while opening a door to the dark.</p>
<p>This seems like mind-control. What this implies is that words have an effect on conciousness- they reverberate. Christians, Jews and Muslims must be aware of this fact, as this is the reason: "Don't curse the Lord's Name" is a Commandment.</p>
<p>Pick your favorite replacement for that word. I go by "inoculation", although that term implies immunization, which is pretty generous to say about this experiment. Others just go with "experiment", so the term you'll hear me use most frequently is "experimental inoculation". It's also defined as a <em>gene therapy</em>, but the problem is how good this sounds. "Gene" almost rhymes with "vaccine", and the word "therapy" carries its own set of lights.</p>
<p>What's important is that you put a pinch of thought into every word you say. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/olg8qk/know_this_words_are_spells_by_calling_it_a">Your words have an effect</a>, so think before you speak.</p></p>
