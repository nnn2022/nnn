        <p>It will never be eradicated so let's make sure we just wear masks 24/7, stay in our homes forever, close down all businesses other than Amazon, get our monthly corona vaccines, and then we'll all be safe.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't even have a problem with the lockdowns if we just had a simple fixed end date.  "As of September 1, everything is open!"  Just quit moving the goal posts.    </p>
<p>Under the current definition, they can legitimately call anything COVID.  Any cold-like symptoms can be called COVID.  It could literally go on forever.</p>

        <p>But that's like saying "Predict when and where all of the hurricanes for this year will hit by January 1st. If any show up when you didn't predict it, you're not allowed to evacuate because that doesn't allow people and businesses enough time to plan." There's absolutely no way to know how many hurricanes will occur at the beginning of the year, much less when and where they'll hit.</p>
<p>This isn't a case of moving goalposts. It's a case of looking at new data, taking corrective action, and then gathering more data. Rinse repeat.</p>
<p>If we had put resources into developing widespread testing and frequent cheap rapid testing (which was suggested by a Nobel prize winning Economist as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2IbrT16uJI">early as May</a> but is now being taken a <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/07/22/893931848/rapid-cheap-less-accurate-coronavirus-testing-has-a-place-scientists-say">bit more seriously</a>) then there's no more widespread reactive lockdowns. If everyone spits on a test stick every day or two then there is no "you have the sniffles, lock down for 2 weeks." We know it's most likely not covid, so it must be a cold, or allergies or whatever. And then we can get back to going to schools, churches, restaurants, etc. without being concerned about putting grandma in the hospital. Or it is covid and you and your family stay home for 2 weeks while everyone else goes about their business.</p>
<p>No, taking a test every day isn't completely like things were back in January, but it's a hell of a lot better than where we are now. Making this many tests is no larger an undertaking than providing every American a can of soda or a cup of coffee every day which we basically already do. Which is to say it isn't cheap, but it's on a scale that we're all familiar with.</p>

        <p>&rt; It's a case of looking at new data, taking corrective action</p>
<p>Then they need to set some very transparent goals in terms of ICU/deaths and be very transparent in how they're reporting them.</p>
<p>Politicians are just covering their asses, there's zero accountability. How can Cuomo put infected patients in nursing homes and go on a victory lap with the highest death rate in the WORLD? He's a tyrant, and so is any other politician using this thing as a political hammer.</p>

        <p>Who gives a shit... It's IFR is so tiny it can stay around until human extinction and nothing will change, cigarettes related death blow the covid hoax out of the waters with yearly deaths. 7 Million people a year die due to cigarette related illnesses according to the clowns at the CDC.</p>
<p>I think stupid people need to understand it's IFR, that's the game changer... Once the mass understands that part, this hoax will lose it's steam and people will revolt.</p>

        <p>Aww, don't do that to yourself.  I know how easy it is to feel powerless right now, but make positive changes where you can (or, in your case, continue down the positive path you've already made for yourself).</p>
<p>I've been miserable over the state of the world, too.  I'm not accepting of this as the new normal, but there's not much I can do about it.  What I can do is make positive changes for myself.  I'm exercising more, eating better, no longer drinking alcohol or caffeine, and just doing everything I can to take better care of myself so that I'm even healthier when the world finally goes back to normal.  It may be hard sometimes, but I can do it, and so can you.</p>

        <p>Thanks I don’t think I’ll go down that road tbh. May not pass one up at a friend’s when having a beer but won’t buy a pack. Took too damn long to quit and I was getting bronchitis constantly at the end (wouldn’t want to be mistaken as having covid would we!) but no I’m committed to surviving out of spite! So I may drink a bit more but won’t be backtracking on cigarette progress! Good luck to you as well! Idk you but I’m proud of you!</p>

        <p>Yea man, maybe grab one at a friends house but lol trust me don’t buy another pack. 
I actually am also about 2 years quit and I just bought a pack last week to “keep in my safe and only grab 1 every now and then” I blew through the entire thing in 3 days.
It was about half a bitch to stop even after just that and I’m back on the gum for a few days to help. 
Don’t do it!! Remember why we quit! Clothes smell awful, hands smell awful, nicotine sick, diarrhea constantly, expensive as hell! 
Goodluck.</p>

        <p>Cigarettes cause all those deaths, and yet these crazy lunatics won’t go complain about all the places that sell cigarettes. These fools go on and on about why we need to cancel everything even remotely reeking of fun until 2029 and yet they haven’t stormed down any place that sells cigarettes, booze, and nor have they stormed McDonalds. They keep saying “we shouldn’t value money and the economy over people’s lives!” and yet all these things I mentioned have been allowed to be sold or open this entire time.</p>

        <p>Hope it kills me on its next run through. If all I’m good for is working then being told I’m a murderer for trying to enjoy life, what’s the fucking point of surviving? If you choke off everyone’s ability to just live, you’re gonna have people just hoping they get it and it kills them. I think these people have no clue that if you constantly tell people to cower in fear and tell them there’s nothing to live for except that fear, a large swath just eventually will not care if they die.

        <p>I definitely agree. While not suicidal I certainly feel very hopeless with everything and have nothing to look forward too. It makes life not worth living.  People need to realise that life has risks and we need to face them.  I’d rather get it, realise it’s fine for my age demographic and get on with life.

        <p>Yeah I’m not suicidal because I wouldn’t do that to my parents but I’m feeling less risk averse than I’ve ever been. I’m not scared of anything anymore. Death doesn’t scare me a bit in all of this. And I think it’s the relentless onslaught of someone pushing panic on me that has me here. I just don’t care what happens to me anymore. It would be quite freeing if I had more to do.</p>

        <p>I felt that way when I was depressed when my son was very ill a few years ago. I wasn't suicidal either, but I no longer cared if we all died. I used to be so afraid of flying, for instance, but when I flew during that time I didn't care if the plane crashed and so I had zero anxiety about the flight. It was quite freeing in a way, but also kind of scary that I literally didn't give a fuck.</p>

<p>It can't be denied that the lockdowns are directly causing death and suffering including but not limited to the forms of suicide and drug overdose. But for some strange reason the hivemind doesn't care about <em>that</em> death and suffering.</p>

        <p>It’s just wild because what I see online vs what I see IRL is just a staggering difference of emotion and all together living. Traffic in Phoenix AZ today was as bad if not worse than a Wednesday before all this. I was stopped by a 50 car funeral procession headed to the cemetery I live near meaning massive funerals are taking place and I’m damn sure they aren’t all happening outside because it’s 112 with humidity currently. Parking lots for every type of business are full. Indoor jungle gyms for kids are open (I’m staying by one currently and saw kids pouring in and out yesterday). I know weddings are still happening because I have friends attending them. </p>
<p>Something doesn’t add up here. I’m not seeing any fear in public. Restaurants with bars are packed. Yet you go online and it’s like bodies are lining the streets if you didn’t go out and see that’s not the case yourself. I’m starting to think that people are actually learning that if you just don’t talk about every last thing you’re doing on social media, you can continue on with life without the scrutiny of the screeching doomers. Will be interesting to see if social media use continues to drop off. I’m certainly not checking in to places anymore or discussing my every move anymore. Those days are over for me.</p>

        <p>Definitely.  In the UK masks are becoming mandated in stores yet no one wears them except the occasional healthy person or elderly people, yet on social media we’re acting like it’s still March and the first few weeks of lockdown.  Yet things are nearly normal aside from the stupid store one way systems and restrictions but people seem to be living life. I find it weird that tomorrow ( when the mandatory masks start) everyone is just gonna throw on a mask to go into a store</p>

        <p>Oh yes I heard about your guy’s mask mandate. We have them here although it’s not statewide, just private businesses requiring them which alright fine I’m going along with that because it’s not stopping me from doing all my normal stuff. I know a ton of people on vacation and flying to different places for those vacations. I live in a resort area where this time of year is normally slow but our resorts are charging over twice what they normally do this time of year because demand is so high. I tried to get a room for a staycation and they’re booked for the month. We never have this kind of volume this time of year! My dad lives in Florida and he said his town is busier than usual even though the heat is terrible down there right now. None of this aligns with the doom and gloom in the news. I honestly think there’s a point at which many burn out on panic. Tell people enough that they’re going to die from everything they do and the brain gets to a point that’s like “ok try me then”. I’m there and I know many who are as well. So yeah big discrepancies between online narrative and what’s actually going on.</p>

        <p>This isn't really surprising at all. We've only ever eradicated a single disease that infects humans: Smallpox. So predicting that we'll never eradicate <em>any</em> disease is a pretty safe bet (though we are getting pretty close with Polio). </p>
<p>Covid-19 has the added factor that it can infect animal hosts. Unless you want to kill or inoculate every bat, cow, dog, and rodent on the planet then there will always be a reserve population where it can hang out. </p>
<p>All of that is why we need herd immunity, preferably through a vaccine.  That said, there have been some hints in the past few days that infection with similar betacoronaviruses may be what's causing the high asymptomatic rate. If that's the case then we might be seeing something like with the original smallpox/cowpox conferred immunity.</p>
<p>Once we have herd immunity in place then we should only see small pockets of disease rather than watching it sweep through an entire population of which a significant percentage will end up in a hospital or dead.</p>

        <p>No idea.  It’s like 1984 with the shifting enemies.  It’s not EurAsia it’s eastAsia now.  But seriously the original purpose was to just ensure ( in the UK) that the NHS was not overwhelmed.  They have these big nightingale field hospitals set up and they dismantled them later because they didn’t get enough cases to warrant its use. Yet the fear continued. It’s insane</p>

        <p>i noticed that the elite dont lie. and fauci may more than likely be one of them. they purposely confuse us though by withholding the truth. 
it is true that corona wont ever go away. there is something called “corona discharge “ its comin from those “corona“ towers that beam signals to cells etc. please research it. 
the frequencies of the now new generation of wireless connection of things... is so fast it penetrates your airs oxygen molecules and your body. 
in case you didn’t know, your new vaccine  will contain something like nano bots, and they will connect to your new generation internet of “things “. you will be one of those “things “. AI things. 
thing newest generation of wireless connection is not for humans. 
so there will always be the corona disease. 
expect soon many more people to drop down dead, when we receive the covID vaccine, because its new and there was no time to test it, they say. 
also, the test is more than likely testing you as subject, no virus. im almost suspecting they insert something im the brain blood barrier. 
don’t worry, after all this dilemma the few surviving people will move to one of those empty new cities in Africa and china, i assume. them it will be over... perhaps. 
maybe i should post this in conspiracies sub lol</p>

        <p>I just want it to be over in the context of everyone getting back to some kind of normalcy. Yes. I know. Everyone talks about how "the normal we're used to will never be the same..." I get that. I also get the fact that a lot of people want to experience the joy of traveling internationally, the camaraderie of watching live sports, and the euphoria of watching your favorite artist/band in person. </p>
<p>Forget those experiences for a second. The most important part of wanting this to be over is the fact that a lot of people are seeing their entire livelihoods disappear with no guarantee of getting any unemployment benefits or finding another opportunity for employment. Even then, I feel like my opinion is gonna get blurbed out by the noise of everyone on this subreddit screaming, "well try telling that to your grandma or your parents who are DEAD because of people like you!" Can't we just agree that both options (meaning 1. Mitigate the virus in whatever capacity we have to regardless of societal consequences vs 2. Attempt a more balanced approach of getting the economy (no not the stock market) going while doing what's possible to minimize the damage of covid) are just poor decisions we have to make? Honestly, I'm glad I'm not in our leader's shoes. This is probably the hardest choice a local/national leader has to make in their lifetime.</p>
