        <p>When I was in 4th grade in 97-98, my school took in a Yugoslavian refugee. Now the mid 90s in the US were a fucking utopia and most kids were pretty insulated from what was happening in the Balkans. My parents didn’t hide world issues from me as a kid so I knew a bit more than the average 10 year old. I was very curious about this girl and wanted to be her friend if for no other reason than to give her a peaceful experience in this new place.</p>
<p>This poor girl was just fucking traumatized. She was violent, combative, cussed like a sailor and since I went to a very cushy insulated private school, teachers and parents alike were pretty concerned from the get-go. She was starting fights with kids who just walked up to her to say hi and introduce themselves. They eventually had to find another school for this girl to attend because parents weren’t paying our private school to have their kids beat up for trying to make friends.</p>
<p>They had an assembly after the fact and explained what all had gone on in Yugoslavia and what the situation was and why this girl was so mad and angry despite us trying to be nice and welcoming. They explained the psychological torture she had endured by witnessing such insane civil war.</p>
<p>I remember as a kid in the Midwest in the 90s just thinking “thank god that could never happen here.”</p>
<p>I really wish I could still think that. It depresses the hell out of me to see where we are now. I’m just grateful I got to live in such a peaceful place for so long even if it is coming to an end.</p>
