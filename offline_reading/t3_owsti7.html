    <strong>My patient portal gives information about overdue vaccines and Covid-19 is one of them</strong>
    <p><p>I otherwise have liked my PCP and have gone to her for years. I have not liked one of her assistants though. In my patient portal it gives information about overdue procedures: Hep C screening, Pap, and Covid-19 vaccine. I was so dismayed to see it because this is the first time I've seen it in my patient portal. I suppose the notification was going to come sooner rather than later. I'm a bit worried that if I ever have to go to the doctor for anything, I'll be asked about this. I'm trying to avoid going to the PCP but my health isn't stellar; I've had prediabetes within the past 3 years.</p></p>

        <p>Just say no, they can not force you take a vaccine.</p>
<p>Show them most people, including doctors, are completely unaware that there have been over 500,000 adverse reactions reported, including over 11,000 deaths.</p>
<p>Just look through all the deaths with them,</p>
<p>Here are a few:</p>
<p>Patient was a 16yr female who received Pfizer vaccine 3/19/21 at vaccine clinic and presented with ongoing CPR to the ED 3/28/21 after cardiac arrest at home. Patient placed on ECMO and imaging revealed bilateral large pulmonary embolism as likely etiology of arrest. Risk factors included oral contraceptive use. Labs have since confirmed absence of Factor V leiden or prothrombin gene mutation. Patient declared dead by neurologic criteria 3/30/21.</p>
<p>Patient received second dose of Pfizer vaccine on March 17, 2020 while at work. March 18, 2020 her 5 month old breastfed infant developed a rash and within 24 hours was inconsolable, refusing to eat, and developed a fever. Patient brought baby to local ER where assessments were performed, blood analysis revealed elevated liver enzymes. Infant was hospitalized but continued to decline and passed away. Diagnosis of TTP. No known allergies. No new exposures aside from the mother's vaccination the previous day.</p>

        <p>Tell them you are not getting it. Period. They cannot deny you medical care. If they do, find another PCP and sue.</p>

        <p>Yup, and I got an e-mail asking me if I got my vaccine yet and to send them a pic of my card if I have. Back in Feb my doctor and I decided I wasn't getting it so it's just auto-generated and I'm ignoring it for now. We'll see how long they let that go.</p>
