        <p>You have no idea what real pressure is, you think having to stay indoors and not see your friends and family for a few weeks is bad? Try living in a city where curfew is run by the gangs. Stay inside or get shot! Or how about governments that really run your life, the fact we are talking like this freely without consequences or fear off our life and you have the audacity to claim your freedoms are being restricted. I stand by my title because you all are bandwagon fakes that only want to believe the world's against you when in fact, you're against the world!</p>

        <p>&rt; Do you really think the governments of the world are going to gather round all the anti-vaxxers and put them in gas Chambers?</p>
<p>No. I think it's going to start out more subtle. And it's not going to happen everywhere. Doing it all in at the start would be an outright declaration of war against citizens, and would be too blatant to hide or camouflage. But it might not reach that end, and if it does it may not get there in a hundred years. But the people in high places that don't want to be seen are in it for the long haul. They call it "The Long March". The point for them is to take an inch at a time. And we're seeing the results now, with BLM and Antifa, Socialism being taught openly, Marxist organizing and attempting to change everything that has made us a successful nation and destroy deeply held values.</p>
<p>&rt;   Hahahaha if that's what you think then you would rather violently die then put a vaccine in your body that "may" be bad for you? </p>
<p>This is a poorly constructed sentence. Would you like to try again? I'll address one part of it. No, I don't want to die, violently or not. No, I do not want to take the experimental mRNA injection which is not a vaccine. It is entirely withing reason for these two things to not be connected.</p>
<p>&rt;   Fuck you cunts are twisted</p>
<p>You believe what the government is telling you is the truth and that they have nothing but your best interests in mind. That's a superior type of delusion. It's also what led people to ignore all of the greatest crimes against humanity.</p>
<p>If you have nothing constructive to say or do, then please leave. Go back to your chains, to your bread and circuses, and we'll forget you exist.</p>

<p>&rt;   It's time for draconian COVID passports that give Vaxxed people as many freedoms as possible and criminalize people who insist on spreading the plague! I don't like to give any more power to the state but these anti-vaxxers are not fit to be considered citizens (in the classic Grecco sense of the word - as they are no longer inhabitants participating as joint proprietors in support of the state). Name them, shame them - take away their freedoms and turn the screws in them until they comply and we can live in a fucking society again.</p>
