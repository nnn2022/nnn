        <p>And yet none of those vaccines are 100% effective.</p>
<p>They work because everyone's been vaccinated with them, so the virus can't jump to new carriers easily.</p>
<p>There are still measles outbreaks that infect vaccinated people, in areas with low vaccination rates.</p>

        <p>Oh yeah they're all more effective than any COVID vaccine, not arguing that. Not 99% better, but they are much better.</p>
<p>It's impossible for any COVID vaccine to have a decades-long track record, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>If a COVID vaccine were fully FDA-approved, would that make any difference to you?</p>

        <p>Only way I’d ever consider taking that shot is if it is scrutinized with the exact same guidelines and rigorous testing all other forms of medicine must go through to be approved  for public use. That means years of study. If it is fast tracked to approval that means one thing. It’s all political. No interested. </p>
<p>Here is the thing man. When I was in the army every freaking October I was forced to take a flu shot. Guess what happened within 12 hours, yep I had the flu and was miserable for weeks after. So In the event the jab gets approved, I ain’t getting it, just like I don’t get the flu shot.</p>

        <p>Actually seatbelts can cause injury, only when there's an accident though. It's not like putting one on carries a risk of injury though, so you're right. Driving on the other hand, whew probably the riskiest daily activity people do. Heck for many it's more risky then catching COVID...</p>

        <p>You need to choose better analogies.</p>
<p>&rt; Wearing a seatbelt does not mean you are 100% protected from dying in a car accident, but it greatly improves your chances of surviving one.</p>
<p>I could dismiss this the same way people dismissed the comparisons between cancer and COVID. I.e. car crashes aren't contagious.</p>
<p>But let's see, what's the similarity between seatbelts, vaccines, and/or vaccine passports?<br>
Both are supposed to increase your chance of survival. So they're personal safety devices. A person in another car not wearing a seatbelt does not diminish your seatbelt's effectiveness. The same way as someone unvaccinated does not decrease your vaccine's effectiveness. Also believe it or not some people still don't wear seatbelts, as is their choice.</p>
<p>&rt;Having anti-lock brakes does not mean you cannot crash your car, but it makes that event less likely. </p>
<p>I'm not sure how this relates to vaccines or vaccine passports? Anti-lock breaks help you control your car during dangerous situations. They allow you some level of control when you crash, they don't prevent someone crashing into you. They're again a personal device but require active use.</p>
<p>Honestly, seatbelts are a better analogy for masks, not sure how you can twist them to vaccines. Even when used as an analogy to masks they're not good; you see we don't wear seatbelts when cars are parked, at our desks, or on our sofas. Only where it makes sense for such safety equipment to be used. If anything, that argues for their use in proper, clinical settings, like hospitals.</p>
