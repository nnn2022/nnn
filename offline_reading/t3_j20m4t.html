        <p>If all of this ends and it turned out the Jews didn't actually crash the German economy, the people in the right would still be the ones who played it safe thinking that they were helping save lives, not the selfish ones who decided that because they were slightly uncomfortable, they had to stop listening to people in government.</p>

        <p>It's the antivax movement all over again. Those fools also had to hide in their safe spaces and congratulate each other on being a societal menace so they wouldn't have their ideas challenged. And when they were challenged, they wrote of their valiant battles against the sheep in places just like this where their fellow narcissists would confirm how very special and smart and brave they were! <em>Oh your family and friends are excluding you because you won't wear a--</em> er I mean <em>won't vaccinate your child? Oh poor baby. You're so smart and brave. You don't need them! You just need us, your super special anti-ma...</em> Fuck, oops... <em>Anti-vax friends! There's absolutely nothing wrong with you!</em></p>
