        <p>You won't have control over the passport though. Any number of conditions could be added in the future, and you're stuck with following them because you need it.</p>
<p>I don't know if that guy's right that it will be a life of pure misery. But he's not wrong that you will be yoked to that passport for entry to businesses, events, travel etc, and that you'll have no say over whether conditions to renew it will change.</p>

<p>What proof? All they ask is you get a vaccine that prevents the spread of a deadly, highly contagious disease. What is the problem with that? Even if another pandemic occurs and they ask the same thing, what's the problem?</p>

        <p>Yes in medieval feudalism the serfs cultivated the Land that the lord owned and paid a 25% tax on what they produced and people think they were slaves. In contrast to what the state robs today its miniscule. You are just a Free range human on a tax farm.</p>

        <p>nah ive defo seen people saying this is 100% nothing like communism and it's actually capitalism</p>
<p>to me nothing the states do nowadays looks like capitalism, you're more restricted by the day on what you do (financially or otherwise) while the state happily props up its closest friends.</p>
<p>though really neo-communism goes all out on the cultural aspect rather than the financial, so that all the serfs are stuck at each other's throats while the state can do the above unopposed. didntcha notice how quick they shut Occupy Wall Street down with identity politics? granted i think that was started by leftists in the first place so it was bound to fail, but... something to think on.</p>

        <p>Nah. If this were actual communism I'd support it. Communism takes from the capitalists class like Bezos and Gates and Trump. (China is state capitalist and the soviets we're fascists. Am rican communism will be anti-government and pro worker by definition).</p>

        <p>There's a big difference here.</p>
<p>One 'side' is all kinds of sure that COMMUNISM is coming (...it's not) and there's a sekrit plan to install COMMUNISM (...there isn't) and that COMMUNISM will result in an elite class of oligarchs and then basically a bunch of serfs with a non-existent or tiny middle class. (That part is pretty much true, from observable history.)</p>
<p>But all of that is fantasy because again, no one who matters is advocating for communism or in a position to implement it. Biden is not a fuckin' communist. The right overuses that word so much that I wonder if they even really know what it means any more.</p>
<p>Anyway, let's compare to what I said - end-stage capitalism, a co-opted political pipeline for sale to the wealthiest, $50 trillion in would be wages for the bottom 90% funneled to the top over the past 50 years (that's YOUR paycheck that is smaller, yes you, reader), a shrinking middle class, an expanding underclass...</p>
<p>What he said we need to worry about <em>is already here</em>. I'm not missing any point - I already see what he's doomcrying about in what we have now.</p>
<p>Solution? Regulation and taxes on inheritance and wealth to keep that wealth in circulation so that Joe Average sees more of it.</p>
<p>Not redistribution. Not forced "equality" but just addressing the lopsided inequality. Higher taxes on ridiculously high brackets encourage higher wages for the unwashed filthy masses. It's simple. Always has been. People would rather pay their employees more than pay 90% of a bracket to the government. I can get behind that sentiment, because a more prosperous everyone means a more prosperous everyone. (think about that.)</p>

        <p>Posts like these are the worst for someone like me, especially the comments. Here I am, not so young anymore, but with some experience. I have lived through the hard communism in Poland back in the day and I have many stories that all end with “and then he was killed/deported to gulag/tortured into obedience”. Whenever I see kids from California or London posting about the wonders of Communism and how bad the capitalism is for everyone, all that comes to my mind is a quote from Revenge of the Sith: “USE MY KNOWLEDGE, I BEG YOU!”</p>
<p>You have no idea what a destructive force communism is, what it does to the healthy tissue of society, how it twists it for generations to come and how hard it is to liberate yourself from it’s nightmare.</p>
<p>Communism changes the hands that hold power from greedy to pure fucking evil. You’d be a worthless cog in the system that is designed to make you less of a human being.</p>

<p>This is already well advanced in USA. Our once proud tradition and history of abolition has now been twisted into 'modern average everyday white men are to blame for the evils of plutocrat owned and operated slavery'. </p>
<p>UN put China in charge of human rights. The entire globe is about to descend into communism. I fully expect to be executed\euthanized.</p>

        <p>Why would you ignore the combined statements and actions of the UN, WHO, IMF, WTO, CDC, USGOV, CIA, FBI, EU and so on?</p>
<p>They keep giving away the plot 'lockdowns must happen every 2 years to save the environment', 'lockdowns must be used to save people from yearly flus', 'economic activity must be strictly limited for regular citizens and their small businesses. this must be done on a whim and on a regular basis'.</p>
<p>They call it 'the great reset'. They had celebrities like Madonna, Tom Hanks and Ellen calling this thing 'the new normal' within the first 10 days! Before the first 2 weeks to slow the curve were even up. They prepared us for this psyop with those absurd chinese 'welding in houses' videos and people flopping all over the street in spams, etc.</p>
<p>Now we are told the vaccine does not mean we can go maskless, just that we can wear a mask on an international airplane flight, which is somehow different from domestic flights.Except first class on certain flights now which are also maskless. Covid knows to avoid antifa, BLM, and first class cabins!! Smart virus!</p>
<p>Then wuhan was maskless and open all summer last summer.. The virus is real, but the lockdown policies are fraudulently justified. China has been given open access to our IP, our markets, our universities, given our manufacturing and future R&amp;D capability, and now their economy is being allowed to simply continue while ours are being shut down artificially over 'a pandemic' we wouldnt know existed if the MSM was not pushing it relentlessly.</p>
<p>And do not think I am 'blaming china'. Oh no. this is the result of the coordinated efforts of the entire western global status quo, who appear to be deciding to put China at the forefront of all commercial, scientific, and similar activity going forward.</p>
<p>There are many reasons for this, not least of which is China's lack of western ethics and environmental concerns - which these same damned globalists programmed into us!</p>
<p>This is what newsom and lightfoot and the other global-thinktank funded. plutocrat slected 'local leaders' all mean when they say 'the lockdowns are enforcing equity'. They mean the 'great reset' is intended to specifically target the 'privileged' and reset them down to the level of the average welfare dependent misanthrope. They will 'reset' the corner store owner down to the level of the state welfare dependant.</p>
<p>This is why BLM\antifa were not condemned for rioting 'in a pandemic', but were in fact encouraged and their bails paid by the same celbrities, polliticians, organizations and thinktanks still telling us 'we must lockdown to save the environment, to limit peasant economic activity from making jealousy among their ranks, and to force even the strident hard working individuals to have no more merit or self respect than a career criminal and welfare fraud.</p>

<p>because they followed advice from medical professionals. Unfortunately the US is full of idiots like you who don't take a pandemic that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives seriously all because "idk anyone with covid". Well you probably don't know anyone with AIDS or Tuberculosis, but I assure you, they are real as well. The fact you typed up this response in less than 5 minutes makes it clear to me that you are just a shill who repeats whatever agenda they see on facebook. You think you are woke, going on and on about "global thinktanks". Read a book-- a real book, and stop letting fear control you.</p>

        <p>Nobody is forcing you to get a vaccine. I couldn't care less if you get one or not, though it would make herd immunity much more effective if you did. I also don't believe it's a "rushed" vaccine. It took over a year, and with todays modern technology and science, it's really not that hard for me to believe it's effective. If not, what does it even matter? Yeah, you have to sit in a doctor's office for an hour, but otherwise, it's not they're injecting you with cancer cells (which is as likely as any other vaccine you've had).</p>
<p>Get it, don't get it, but you can't be upset that you can't fly on a plane if you don't. Air travel isn't a constitutional right and it makes sense to be vaccinated if the option is on the table.</p>

        <p>Indeed. Sadly the doublespeak in the educational system today, combined with mainstream corporate media has befuddled the minds of the young &amp; old alike. Have you ever noticed that Covid Communism pushes the notion that “ you should get vaccinated to protect everyone else” ? This is where the Marxist manifesto begins, the fact is, only by protecting the rights &amp; freedoms of the individual, are the rights of the collective assured. When the rights of the collective are put first, the rights of the individual go down the toilet, and as Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot &amp; others proved, the rights of the collective get flushed too. Hundreds of millions have already died by the hands of these bastards, it’s time to educate our fellow citizens.</p>

        <p>Capitalism has failed us too and well Communism sucked too. Anyhow in America it's socialism for the rich, at the government trough, and bootstrap capitalism for the poor, go starve, there's the gutter, no health care and pay that actually has you afford food and a decent place to live.</p>

        <p>Massive companies and their ownership become 'the state' under communism. Meanwhile small businesses are set upon by angry Lumpen Proles spurned on to violence by banker propaganda aimed at dividing the working class.</p>
<p>How many times have you asked this question? I bet you have been told this same thing dozens of times and you simply refuse to accept the facts of the matter.</p>
<p>Every corporation that supported BLM is supporting some bastard globalist version of communism. Under global communism, multinational corporations become effectively above the law and create the law, much like Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, the big banks, and so on now do with impunity.</p>
<p>Over  75% of silicon valley engineers are non-US citizens. That is how the plutocrats manage our information so illiberally without pushback and revolt among their workers: their workers are an invading army of self interested actors. These self interested foreign citizens are generally the ones creating this platform for globalism and neo\faux communism to be promoted while any and all nationalism is shouted down and re-framed as somehow nazism.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the entire west combined is less than 10% of global population, and now we are being told we are the Kulak's of the globe, while the billionaires and their millionaire friends pull up the ramparts and hand pitchforks to the now enraged outsiders who have had the entire sophisticated western media utilized to convince them that we westerners are their enemy and owe them something for generations of their own failings.</p>

        <p>Really? Are you advocating for a lack of regulation/licensing? You want to go back to a time when it was legal for that server you pissed off to jack off into your meal? Ooh, let's get rid of food regulations so companies can save money by using whatever they like without pesky regulations on "food safety." Maybe we can go back to the snake oil days when you didn't know if the aspirin you were buying had any aspirin in it or not. Or we can do away with the regulations on wages so you can make the same as that kid in China who made your shoes for $5 a month. How about no licensing for doctors? It'd be fun trying to guess which surgeon actually knows how to do the surgery you need. Right?</p>
<p>Is that what you're advocating?</p>

<p>You're right. Instead of doing a quick study with emergency authorization it would've been much better to wait years for the full long term trials, with us being locked down and required to wear masks the whole time. That's what you're getting at, right? Kind of interesting y'all are against the vaccine that would get us back to normal quicker.</p>
<p>&rt;Why do the fda support but never actually heal like holistic medicine?</p>
<p>I'm not sure what you're trying to get at here. Traditional medicine is a part of holistic medicine. And I'm pretty sure prescribed antibiotics heal infections.</p>
<p>&rt;so many drugs that have so many bad side effects and only curb symptoms but NEVER actually heal?</p>
<p>That depends on what you're taking and why you're taking it. Taking pain medication won't make your abscess go away, yet the antibiotics prescribed along with them will.</p>
<p>It's very fucking interesting that you take a super anti-medicine stance, yet don't seem to know the slightest thing about it.</p>

<p>This is a false dichotomy. There is many other options than what has been done. For instance they could have not forced a experimental gene therapy, for which they changed the dictionary definition of the word 'vaccine' upon us. There is a bunch of other options also, such as quarantining sick and at risk people while letting the rest of us get on with our human rights.</p>

<p>&rt;There is many other options than what has been done. For instance they could have not forced a experimental gene therapy, for which they changed the dictionary definition of the word 'vaccine' upon us.</p>
<p>That falls under emergency authorization without a full, long term study.</p>
<p>&rt;There is a bunch of other options also, such as quarantining sick and at risk people while letting the rest of us get on with our human rights.</p>
<p>And we've seen how well that works, especially when people refuse to distance, wear masks, or take basic health precautions. Also, how do you quarantine asymptomatic people? Test everyone continually?</p>
<p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa1693/5952826">We found no difference in nasopharyngeal viral load by age or between symptomatic and asymptomatic children.</a> So you would need to test everyone, not just people who show symptoms. And as for showing symptoms:</p>
<p><a href="https://medical.mit.edu/covid-19-updates/2020/07/how-long-symptom-onset-person-contagious">Though this reanalysis did not change their estimate of the proportion of presymptomatic transmission (44%), it did show that infectiousness peaked at symptom onset rather than slightly earlier, as originally observed. They also found that infectiousness started to rise, on average, earlier than noted in their original paper — at about three days prior to symptom onset, with approximately 9% of viral transmission occurring even earlier.</a></p>
<p>Presymptomatic transmission is a thing meaning, again, you'd need to test everyone continually as the virus is spread before symptoms appear. How do you test everyone every day? </p>
<p>Personally, how many swabs are you willing to take up the nose before you refuse?</p>

<p>No. We literally locked down everyone, and in many places they are still locked down.
Imagine trusting these 'public health' officials when half of their rhetoric is about confronting 'inequity' and the other half is about 'confronting white supremacy' and then there is another half about 'fixing the environment', but all that is really happening is the largest transfer of wealth from working people to the rich in all of human history.</p>

        <p>Hahahaha, what a load of shit.</p>
<p>&rt;We literally locked down everyone</p>
<p>So when did North Dakota and South Dakota lock down? Thank you for the bald faced lie, but why bother lying when it's so easy to disprove? </p>
<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/north-dakota-south-dakota-set-global-covid-records-how-did-n1257004">Unlike states that had soaring case counts early in the pandemic, neither North Dakota nor South Dakota ever issued stay-at-home orders.</a> </p>
<p>Or are they not included in "literally everyone"? And how did the Dakotas fare without their lockdowns? <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/public-health/states-ranked-by-confirmed-covid-19-cases-july-1.html">North Dakota is ranked #1 in cases per 100k population. South Dakota is ranked #2.</a></p>
<p>So yes, we've seen exactly how well it works when we leave it up to the general population. If you need more proof, how about the thousands of people gathered in Florida for spring break? Tell me, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/spring-break-no-other-miami-beach-extends-curfew-control-crowds-n1261696">how many of the people that you see in the video</a> are practicing any sort of basic hygeine, or have the slightest regard for the possible spread of the virus?</p>

<p>This is a issue of degrees. You cannot claim that Covid requires ANY lockdowns. The severity is irrelevant. The stats from all the states and countries not locking down proved this.</p>
<p>&rt; Personally, how many swabs are you willing to take up the nose before you refuse?</p>
<p>Zero.</p>
<p>&rt; How do you test everyone every day?</p>
<p>Ask the universities. Many are doing twice-weekly testing of every student. Really.</p>
<p>&rt;Also, how do you quarantine asymptomatic people?</p>
<p>Asymptomatic is synonymous with 'not sick'. You dont quarantine them.</p>

        <p>What stats? Where are you getting them? Can you link them here? And if so, why didn't you?</p>
<p>&rt;There is a bunch of other options also, such as quarantining sick and at risk people while letting the rest of us get on with our human rights.</p>
<p>So explain how that makes any sense with your comment about refusing testing? How are you supposed to quarantine if you don't know if you're sick?</p>
<p>&rt;Many are doing twice-weekly testing of every student. Really.</p>
<p>Is this testing EVERYONE EVERY DAY like I said, or are you throwing out some irrelevant shit because you got nothing better? I'm pretty sure "students at X college" isn't everyone, and I'm also relatively sure "twice weekly" isn't the same as daily. Try harder.</p>
<p>&rt;Asymptomatic is synonymous with 'not sick'.</p>
<p>Except it's not. And you would've known that had you read my earlier comment and actually understood it.  <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa1693/5952826">We found no difference in nasopharyngeal viral load by age or between symptomatic and asymptomatic children.</a> So symptomatic and asymptomatic people had the same amount of virus in their body. Sounds to me that means they were sick, without symptoms.</p>
<p>I have no clue why I'm bothering to reply, since you're clearly either incapable, or not interested, in understanding anything I have to say. I see no point in continuing this, unless you feel the need to spout the same tired rhetoric over and over.</p>

        <p>&rt;The side effects are the same as regular flu.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>&rt;Although COVID-19 is seen as a disease that primarily affects the lungs, it can damage many other organs as well. This organ damage may increase the risk of long-term health problems. Organs that may be affected by COVID-19 include:<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Heart. Imaging tests taken months after recovery from COVID-19 have shown lasting damage to the heart muscle, even in people who experienced only mild COVID-19 symptoms. This may increase the risk of heart failure or other heart complications in the future.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Lungs. The type of pneumonia often associated with COVID-19 can cause long-standing damage to the tiny air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs. The resulting scar tissue can lead to long-term breathing problems.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Brain. Even in young people, COVID-19 can cause strokes, seizures and Guillain-Barre syndrome — a condition that causes temporary paralysis. COVID-19 may also increase the risk of developing Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-long-term-effects/art-20490351">Doesn't sound like the flu to me</a>. And just to point out the amazing idiocy of the "same as regular flu," how many people require ventilators due to catching the regular flu? Not only that, but since you want to compare it to the flu, how many Americans does the flu kill every year? Find those numbers and compare them to the covid numbers. Tell me what you come up with.</p>
<p>&rt;so is your attempt at defending the indefensible destruction of society over a disease that is similar to a seasonal flu.</p>
<p>So you're getting the absolutely wrong thing out of this conversation. Why does that not surprise me? You have not been able to make a single point that's not easily poked full of holes. You keep moving the goalposts here and there, but you can't stop moving them.</p>
<p>I'd love if there were no more lockdowns. I'd love if Americans could pull their heads out of their collective ass and quit acting like entitled, spoiled ass children. I'm almost certain to be disappointed on both counts.</p>
<p>&rt;stay home</p>
<p>Funny you should say that. I've been working from home since before the pandemic, and I leave the house maybe once a week, mainly to go to the store. This hasn't really affected me as much as it has everyone else. Basically the only change has been putting on the big scary mask before I go out. That's it. </p>
<p>What about people who don't have the luxury of being me? You know, the people getting stabbed, getting shot, etc. all because of the stupid violent people who don't like masks? Or the minimum wage workers getting screamed at because some selfish prick just can't be terribly inconvenienced by having to wear a piece of cloth for a few minutes? Fuck them, right?</p>

        <p>Stay home if you are afraid. Entire countries barely locked down. Are you suggestion these countries will be wracked with horrible side effects?</p>
<p>These side effects which are clearly fearmongered and rare are minor compared to the DIRECT, common and increasing effects of lockdowns:</p>
<p>What about the frontline min wage 'essential' workers who have been out there since day one? You sound so privileged. There are 100s of millions of people who were forced to work the entire lockdown. They do not get tax funded paid time off like teachers do for the lockdowns. they had no vaccines and THEY ARE FINE.</p>
<p>They have not had any pandemics sweep their break rooms. Proving teachers can go back. It is perfectly safe.</p>
<p>What about all the children? More children have died from lockdown suicide than covid.</p>
<p>https://www.aier.org/article/more-covid-suicides-than-covid-deaths-in-kids/</p>
<p>Proof: https://www.thecollegefix.com/kids-are-10-times-more-likely-to-die-of-suicide-than-coronavirus-medical-professor-warns/</p>
<p>https://www.psycom.net/covid-19-suicide-rates</p>
<p>"Covid-19 disruptions killed 228,000 children in South Asia, says UN report" And in Asia, 228,000 kids have died, so far, from lockdowns. Virtually no kids are dying from Covid. They have a 99.99999% recovery rate.</p>
<p>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-56425115</p>
<p>They began using the phrases 'new normal' and 'great reset' in the firsst 5-10 days of this 'novel virus'. it is literally a salvo in a 5th generational non-linear war being waged by IMF\WTO\globalists in general against western nations and the world. I am not arguing if covid exists or not. It does not matter if it exists because the PCR test regimen will go positive on any coronavirus fragments at 45-50 cycles.</p>
<p>The only reason hospitals were over-full is covid policies designed to force their bed capacity down by 90%. 40% of all deaths were caused by people with normal diseases like pneumonia being sent into retirement homes by overtly globalist neoliberal governors. This is a literal globalist vs western citizen war. this is warfare. This is typically globalist eugenics.</p>

        <p>Wealthy, often elderly plutocrats (Pelosi, Newsom, Lightfoot, Whitmer, Feinstein) have repeatedly been seen in public settings without a mask, particularly back at the height of the psyop. Is it a coincidence these are also some of the biggest pushers of dysdtopian lockdown policies? IMO Pelosi's promotion of 'hug an Asian' months into the alleged Chinese outbreak is simply too much to ignore. That was 3 months after Pelosi, a privileged member of multiple committees and holder of a variety of security clearances would have known at least as much as internet nerds knew in December and January of 2019.</p>
<p>You do not want to discuss anything grounded in reality though, you want to discuss the minutiae of ever-changing 'global health' dictates and claims. Meanwhile the common flu also has 50 horrific potential outcomes or side effects or whatever you want to call them.</p>
<p>First class airline cabins are going maskless, putting their wealthiest, highest profit, and most able\willing\experienced to sue them 'at risk'. None of the policies make sense if your 'medical backed' [lol] claims are true. Where are the piles of dead people?</p>
<p>There are entire communities of inner-city poor that refused to mask. Me and my friends and associates have followed every rule because we are good citizens. The inner city poor are not dying at drastically elevated rates. Yes they are elevated compared to the other deaths being mis-identified by fraudulent 40-50 cycle PCR tests, but this is statistically the same as any other day when it comes to these populations. When I say refused to mask, I mean their nightclubs stayed open and they never at any point wore masks en masse.</p>
<p>Teachers are going out for dinner where they take their mask off at tables, then the next day they insist students need to be inside plastic boxes while masked.</p>
<p>Cops are arresting 'non maskers' by grappling with them in close quarters, often themselves not wearing the mask effectively.</p>
<p>and then there is the fact of the matter on masks themselves. Masks cannot stop a virus. This is printed on the every box of masks. This fact is part of decades of medical literature. The improper handling of these masks itself represents a serious biohazard, and that is true with or without covid. The improper wearing\handling of the masks negates literally any benefit you claim they have. The stats from non-lockdown countries and states also negate any benefit you claim they have. Differences of infection rate do not mean anything when the PCR testing is so absurdly fraudulent (40 to 55 cycles!), but even if the PCR testing was not fraudulent the stats we are being provided do not even come close to justifying these absurd lockdowns and 'covid passports'.</p>

Yes antibiotics do kill infections, just as holistic meds do, my point, is that big pharma would be out of business if they actually cared about people enough to make healing meds.  It’s all about money, not fixing the problem the person has.  This is why those scumbags will never cure cancers, diabetes, heart disease and so on.  Money is the root of all evil!</p>

<p>How about that, indeed? </p>
<p>Realistically, what do you think would happen in the market today if all government-mandated licensing for doctors were eliminated?</p>

        <p>Communism, as Marx envisioned it, is a stateless and classless society in which the workers own the means of production.</p>
<p>However, given that not one Communist nation has ever become stateless or classless, the definition of Communism in theory has drifted substantially from how it manifests itself in the real world.</p>
<p>A more accurate description of self-proclaimed Communist nations would be a society in which the state has limitless power over the lives of its citizens, where individual and economic freedom are squashed in the pursuit of an impossible dream.</p>

        <p>One quick correction: that "impossible dream" was never supposed to happen. It was simply a carrot on a stick to greedy masses that turned out to be a trap. The real plan was always centralization of power. The "class warfare" was only used as a ploy to turn people fighting against each other instead of the real enemy.</p>

        <p>Well, no. In reality the leftist "anarchists" will loot the stores of "evil capitalist" business owners and gripe about having to work or pay their rent because they feel their boss and land lord are oppressing them. While at the same time asking government for more handouts. In reality their bosses and landlords are just like them, with the exception that they did a lot of work to save enough money to be in a position to invest it into a business or housing.</p>

        <p>But are these bosses and landlords like the rest of us? People like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos were successful largely because they were at the right place at the right time. And their businesses turning into multi-million corporations often relied on exploiting the working class. Also, Elon Musk was born to very wealthy parents so he was already much better off than most people.</p>
<p>And I want to make it clear, I don't think all business owners are inherently evil. Like the dude who owns your local bakery is probably just trying make his ends meet. And I don't condone looting, but the way in which large corporations dominate small businesses and buy out the competition is much more damaging on a larger scale than a bunch of teen anarchists armed with baseball bats. These small business owners are also victims of capitalism, they're the ones who get crushed by these elitist corporations.</p>
<p>In regards to receiving government handouts, I have no problem with a struggling family of 5 receiving benefits because both parents lost their jobs because a hurricane destroyed the business they were working for. That's just one example, but yeah there's just so many forces out there that's out of our control.</p>

        <p>You would have passed if you had been finished by the first paragraph. All the Countries that tried to become fully communist never did, that still means Communism is still defined as a stateless classless society, just because the country’s that tryed to become it falled, does not mean that the definition has changed.</p>

        <p>That isn't the implication the sign is promoting. The implication:</p>
<p><strong>"Covid-19 is not the goal of the alleged pandemic response, institution of communism is the actual goal"</strong></p>
<p>Somehow I think you understand that and simply refuse to confront the mounting evidence for this idea. IMO it is irrefutable at this time: the globalists are dangling 'communism' in front of the Lumpen Proles of the world as a means to enable sweeping social change of the neoliberal variety.</p>
<p>I actually disagree with the poster also. I think communism is just as much a red herring as covid itself is. To me the real goal is simply ever increased consolidation of power and wealth within the existing banking\military\media status quo and the elite families of history who own everything.</p>

        <p>I don’t think the post is wrong, maybe just incomplete. The real threat is globalism which entails the consolidation of the powers you mentioned. Neo-Communism is a means to convince the masses, while using covid as a way to instill fear and distrust to usurp power. </p>
<p>So Communism alone? Maybe not...but it is not mutually exclusive.</p>

        <p>Sure, it seems you and I agree or mostly agree on the threat. Getting that onto a billboard is the challenge!</p>
<p>Decades ago in rural Michigan I drove past a billboard "GET USA OUT OF THE UN".</p>
<p>That is all it said and I thought it was absurd at the time, but now I fully understand that even back then (around 2000) there were plenty of folks who saw the threat looming clearly over us.</p>
<p>Now in 2021 UN put China on the human rights council, a perch from which China now lectures USA, without apparent irony, for our human rights failings, even as the world finally comes to terms with the fact China is operating not just outrageous modern slave-mills, but also outright concentration camps!</p>
<p>The west is over, and it is hard to fit on a billboard all the ways it is over. A picture of torn paper titled 'Social Contract' would get a lot of the idea across!</p>

        <p>Hello, </p>
<p>I am a old-style Leftist...</p>
<p>I don't understand your arguments at all. They have allready taken control of the economy. for example: that's what the E.U. is about. That's what neoliberalism is about. It's not a conspiracy. Any Leftist could tell you that. What else could they do to convince you that they have done that?</p>
<p>As for the gatherings of the World's oligarchs, elites etc in Davos etc it sounds like a conspiracy theory but it's very probably more like their equivalent of the communist international that Workers organized! It's meetings where they discuss how to reorganize things so that their best interests are served.</p>
<p>So regular people looking at those meetings with dread and the relevant conspiracy theories or sometimes simply announcements (!) are normal.</p>
