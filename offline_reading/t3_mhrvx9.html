    <strong>How is everyone coping?</strong>
    <p><p>Memes and posts aside, how’s everyone doing?</p>
<p>I for one have hit a wall. Both my parents got the moderna vaccine despite me warning them and my mom got very ill.</p>
<p>Between this and the passport, I’m panicking. I just know too much about where this is all headed and it’s terrifying. There seems to do nothing I can do to stop it. Once the vaccine passport and social credit system is underway what am I going to do? Starve? My friends and family all go along with the narrative so I have no one to talk to about this and no one understands why deep down I’m screaming. I act tough, I get mad but deep down I feel something I’ve never experienced between fear and disgust.</p></p>

        <p>I just got into a huge fight with my husband because he got the vaccine. I said it doesn’t even have full FDA approval and he flew into a rage that I was spouting tin foil crap. I checked the FDA website a while ago and it looked like it was only approved under emergency powers. Can someone set me straight? I have no idea which one he got.</p>
<p>I’m so pissed off because my husband and teenage kids treat me like a nut job because I question the narrative. They are being such good liberals. The virus is not dangerous to any of them but the fact he got the vaccine makes me see he’s just as brainwashed as anyone. I feel like I have no place in this world any longer.</p>

        <p>I've watched very close friends of mine all clamor to go get the vaccine as soon as it’s available. I asked literally every single one of them "Have you researched this? Do you know the side effects?" etc and yet not one even looked into it. I'm absolutely stunned and speechless. Many of them I believed were very intelligent. I'm not so sure anymore. And many are actively pressuring me into getting one. I'm seriously starting to think I'll have a lot fewer friends soon.</p>

        <p>They haven't researched it. Someone I know got it and started explaining to me that it's made of dead virus, like the flu. A nurse told her that and it was MODERNA. She didn't even seem to care when I told her it absolutely WAS NOT like the flu shot and explained it a little. 50% or more of my family and friends are virtue signaling about getting it and I just fucking can't.</p>

        <p>She obviously doesn't care because she shrugged when I told her. Her husband already told me he didn't want her getting it, so I was shocked when she told me she already had her second dose. It's amazing that people will happily put their health at risk just to follow the herd.</p>

        <p>It is an adenovirus, but it does not cause your body to create any proteins from what I understand.</p>
<p>From what I can tell, it modifies a similarly structured coronavirus to generate an immune response.</p>
<p>That said, it's efficacy implies that other cold viruses confer some level of immunity against covid, which was theorized early, but I've not seen much discussion about for a long time.</p>

        <p>Honestly, if my husband gets it (and he’s the type that if pressured I think would do it) I’d be scared to ever have unprotected sex with him again. That’s my worst fear. There’s no telling what’s in that stuff that could be passed on through bodily fluids. I’ve been so worried about that happening</p>

        <p>I am so sorry that you have to deal with that. Your husband is an irrational jerk, sorry to say.  This whole Covid thing has been the most divisive issue I have ever seen. I have lost many friendships over this. I’m just truly grateful that my bf is not a brain dead Fauci worshipper (he almost became one, I had to convince him that this is all bs). </p>

        <p>Thanks so much. The crazy thing is before he told me he got the vaccine, I had just mentioned how hopeless I feel. </p>
<p>I packed up a few things and drove to my mother’s place. It was late, so I didn’t call her. I snoozed a little on her couch. This is the first time either of us has done that. Our 30th anniversary is in July.</p>

        <p>Honestly, I'm feeling the EXACT same way. This is truly terrifying and I feel completely helpless. Worse still is that I believe this entire pandemic was simply a coverup for global economic collapse, so I'm concerned things are going to get MUCH worse from here. I haven't been sleeping well, constant nightmares, anxiety is through the roof, and yet I know I'm doing better than many of my peers simply because of my sacrifices over the years. I fear for humanity's future and the newer generations.</p>

        <p>&rt;If a social credit system comes in, we are so screwed.</p>
<p>This depends entirely on how dependent on the system we as individuals are. Store able food is a start but won't last forever. If you haven't done it already it's time to look into how to grow your own food, look into vegetables with protein and fat because it'll be hard to come across meat if you live in a city. If you live near a forest on the other hand it's full of stuff you can eat. Collect during summer and conserve for the whole winter.</p>
<p>&rt;At that point I'm just going to move far away and live on my own.</p>
<p>Loneliness is something we all may have to get used to, vaccinated sheep don't wanna meet other humans, their only social interaction will be over internet, as for us it's a question if we'll even be able to get on the internet in the future. How crazy it might sound, vaccine passports to get an internet connection may be mandatory in a not to distant future.</p>
<p>Moving far away is a good start, on a house there's always stuff to do in order to kill time in the even there's no power or internet. Manual well for water, wood to burn for heat and to cook food etc etc... Buying books might be a good idea, particularly survival books, or print and archive websites with useful survival information while you're still online.</p>
<p>&rt;I'm really hoping for a civil war, that way at least we have a chance.</p>
<p>Maybe, but I'm afraid it's too late, once people realize they've been fooled most people will already be vaccinated, and have a immune system to damaged to ever go outside again. There won't be enough of us, but I guess everyone could drag their straw to the hill, maybe get a drone and drop another pie in Bill Gates face from the sky or something like that.</p>

        <p>I know this is totally off the wall but what concerns me about Florida is that in the event of some kind of disaster it’s not easy to get out. So it’s kinda creepy that it’s becoming a haven for people trying to escape tyranny. All those people in one convenient location that is tough to get out of.</p>

        <p>Problem is, there won't be anywhere to escape to.</p>
<p>This is a global roll out, and it's going to get implemented in every country, eventually at least. </p>
<p>Even if you settle in a secluded part of whatever country you're in, I highly, highly doubt the government and extremists will leave you alone. They will go after dissenters and either imprison or kill them. Remember, they didn't leave the "undesirables" alone in Nazi Germany. The ones who got away were lucky because they fled the EU, problem is, we don't have that luxury since, again, this is a global roll out. And no, Sweden is not a safe haven since they are a pro-globalist country that's already working on microchipping and vaccine passports.</p>

        <p>suicide idealization is all.</p>
<p>more accurately I get by every day and every week enjoying the utmost of what's left for me still, food, girlfriend, restaurants sometimes (but my country closes them again now), geeking, video games, music.</p>
<p>But I feel it coming. The day something irreparably snaps in my life, like losing a job or career and losing opportunity to live my current lifestyle for good, if any of my treasured things and copes snap, that will be my signal to draw my last reverence.</p>

        <p>I get it brother, and I don't mean to Bible thump but this verse changed my perspective and eventually my life in some ways. Psalm 56:3-4 KJV
What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee. In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me. 
Whatever you fear is miniscule in the big picture just remember that. There are people in your life who always love you and even if you don't feel that way God does. Blessings brother I can promise you I have been down that road, I'll save you the trouble by stating definitively that suicide is never the answer, hang on and things will get better, but God is always here if they don't, that is what kept me alive.  Perspective is everything.</p>

If we don't have a normal Fall semester (meaning most classes back in person, NO masks, etc) then I will have completely lost hope. If we're not back to normal by then we never will be.

        <p>Well, i feel isolated, ironically enough. I stopped caring about people because they make constant reminders that if "i don't about their well being" then i should just die so society can move on without people like me.</p>
<p>I guess i will be jobless and homeless when the obligatory mystery goo vaccine reaches my demographic, so my plan is to run around naked throwing shit at these fools until i can no longer survive.</p>
<p>I don't feel sorry for lost friendships or everyone thinking i'm a tinfoil hat lunatic. I don't want to deal with these fools anymore.</p>

        <p>You clearly didn't read that post from the engineer that worked on these passports. He claims they're making it practically impossible to fake them, and even if you can fake the vaccine records, they're still going to track your every move.</p>

        <p>Not coping well at all.  I had one last place that I felt like was doing it’s best to go by these new rules, yet let people do what they used to do: Planet Fitness.  Some of you who have experience with them may have had a different experience, but it seemed to me this whole year we were trending away from fear and isolationism.  Getting away from groupthink.</p>
<p>Then I visited this week.  They have now, just a week ago, installed these plastic barriers between every single piece of cardio equipment.  It’s surreal.  It looks like exercising in a box.  I haven’t been back, and I’m likely cancelling my membership of 4 years.  I can’t exist like that.</p>

        <p>I have also hit a wall. When the pandemic hit I was 32 and starting to really think about my future with my boyfriend - like marriage, kids, buying a house, etc... but then march 2020 happened and I put everything on hold. I also turned 33 during 2020 and now I'm halfway to 34 and i feel like my life is STILL on hold - I live in NY and feel very uncomfortable buying a house here not knowing what this vaccine passport situation will be (I would move if it actually becomes a thing in NY)... and I can't make a decision on having kids because I don't know what the future holds. By the time I *do* know what the future holds, i think i'll be too old to have kids.... it's just... my life has been on hold for over a year now at a very critical age and I'm not sure what to do anymore.</p>
