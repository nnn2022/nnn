        <p>As workers return, they’ll be given face masks, and thermometers so  they can comply with the mandatory temperature check they must conduct  shortly before coming in. Every floor will feature a temperature-check  kiosk for employees feeling unwell, and to provide “a highly visible  assurance of safety at work.”</p>
<p>Since infectious-disease experts believe talking may spread coronavirus, it will be prohibited in elevators.</p>
<p>This is just sad... Demoralizing really, I feel for those people just trying to make a living, but at what point do the employees start making noise about this or quit and work elsewhere ? It's been proven countless times now that covid is really not dangerous at all and has same mortality rate as influenza</p>

        <p>The hypocrisy in that first paragraph is astounding. All this time, we’ve told sick people to stay home. Now we have separate kiosks for people not feeling well who will be in the office while possibly having COVID.</p>
<p>How does that make sense?</p>

        <p>It wasn’t that long ago that I was anti work from home forever. Not because my job can’t be done from home (it can), but because I feel like in the right office, social interactions with your coworkers can still be valuable and fun. But if you’re being told how to walk around, what to do in an elevator and you can’t access any common areas, what‘s even the point? </p>
<p>Who wants to be monitored like this constantly and be told not to talk? Does a two minute elevator ride really put you at that great of a risk for COVID? These rules are so controlling. Who would want to go back to an office? </p>
<p>Once I saw the restrictions my company wants to have in place/currently has for the people who work in the office, I decided I’d rather be at home and indicated that to them as such. I’m not going to be told what way I can walk to go to the bathroom.</p>

        <p>Exactly my thoughts. If it’s more comfortable at home (even with my kids running around) I’ll stay at home. </p>
<p>But I do think we need to get back at some point. WFH has been okay as a stop gap. But not everyone is cut out for it tbh.</p>

        <p>I can see what you’re saying. But I’d rather that return come when there’s less security theater to adhere by. I’m an adult and I think it’s not unreasonable that our workplaces treat us as independent and responsible.</p>

        <p>For sure. Right now I’m gonna stay home given this option. But I’ve already heard people saying “I don’t feel comfortable reentering the workspace”. </p>
<p>It’s really cover for “I don’t like my commute” and “I enjoy being able to slack all day”</p>

        <p>I actually don’t know too much about where people I work with stand on their fear of coming back to work (or lack thereof) or how afraid they are of COVID in general. Which is good because some topics are best avoided at work when having conversation. But the leadership team said at minimum, they’ll be following CDC guidelines and I guess making their own guidelines on top of that. </p>
<p>I have six more months of remote work, at least, to see what might happen.</p>

        <p>Exactly the same with me. I quite like working in the office and am definitely more productive, I think it gives better structure to my life and helps me mentally. I think having a firm line between work and home is healthy. But I am not stepping one foot inside an office of masked sheep and plexiglass booths, I'll just stay home, thanks.</p>
