    <strong>Out Of Curiosity, I started Watching The Amazon Prime Show "Utopia"...</strong>
    <p><p>It could not be found in the Amazon Originals section, nor any other category...I had to manually search for it. After adding it to my watchlist, it does not appear in my watchlist. After watching several episodes, it does not appear in my "continue watching" section. I have to go to the "my stuff" section and that's the only way I can access it.</p>
<p>Maybe it's just some glitch but it seems Amazon wants to make it as hard as possible to find this show. I know, I know...if they really wanted to stop people from watching it they would just remove it. Maybe they thought that would be too obvious and that it would draw too much attention.</p>
<p>If any of you have seen it, how "on the nose" did you find some of the story elements?</p></p>

        <p>I haven't watched that show for ages, but I remember season 1 being great. I might rewatch it now you've prompted me.</p>

        <p>I'm watching the American version now. I heard the British version is better so I will be watching that next.</p>
