    <strong>I had covid. How long should I really isolate? Question/rant.</strong>
    <p><p>I am a paramedic and I came down with a fever 8 days ago and tested positive 7 days ago. Flu-like symptoms resolved by day 3. Does anybody have any new info about how long you can be contagious? </p>
<p>To me, 10 days seems excessive. 14 days seems criminal. It frustrates me how we are treating this like some crazy disease in a Sci-fi movie when we should really be treating it like the flu. When I was a kid, the rule was “24-hours fever-free” and then you could go back to school. When I first got covid, I literally didn’t leave my room for 5 days. My wife brought me a tray of food 2-3 times a day. No sunlight, no exercise, no human contact, and I couldn’t even see the dog. This is what the mainstream recommends and it’s absolutely crazy. Even prisoners get to go outside for an hour a day and they get to leave their cells for meals. After day 5, I couldn’t do it anymore. I left my house and stayed in my car and camped for a few days. I am staying in a hotel room now, courtesy of FEMA. </p>
<p>What’s even crazier is that I had to do all that even with everyone in the house knowing that I had direct contact with them the day I got sick and none of them got it. There are 4 adults living in this house and nobody got it from me even though we were all going about our normal business right up until I had a fever for 12 hours. The night I started to get a fever, I kissed my wife, slept in the same bed with her, I touched everything in the house, etc. Since I am a paramedic, I know I probably got it from a patient at work 4 days before my symptoms started. So if covid is that bad, how come I didn’t give it to anyone in the 4 days I was home after I contracted it? And why is nobody in this house questioning this BS 10-day quarantine even though they should be able to see that they didn’t get it from me already?? </p>
<p>I just think it is so sad that we are putting people through this sci-fi-like quarantine when we probably don’t need to.</p>
<p>TL,DR; Does anybody have any articles on how long the contagious period is? I would like to share some info with my family to make them realize it is time for us to go back to normal? I just want to go home, sit on the couch with everyone, take off my mask, share a meal with my wife, and live our normal lives again.</p></p>

        <p>If it were me personally, wait 1 day past your last sign of symptoms and if you're feeling well, back to business. The 14 day standard is completely unnecessary and excessive.</p>

        <p>What I would do might not be what's recommended but I would wait 48 hours until symptoms are gone and if I'm feeling better would get back to my normal routine to be honest with you... people are treating it like it's the plague, it's just a flu!</p>

        <p>My sister is still trying to figure out how long she needs to quarantine for. She tested positive for it the week before Christmas. Her husband never got infected. And they are with each other pretty much 24/7. They own and run a small business together.</p>

        <p>Yes I definitely had no problem with that when I was sick, and a few days after felt reasonable too. If we are agreeing that this hard-core 10-day quarantine is acceptable now, should we have been doing it all along with the flu too? Why just covid? I mean, it doesn’t make sense to me and we’ve been lied to soooooo much with everything this year that I’m naturally questioning if we are really doing things right.</p>

        <p>The number that I've been hearing is 5 days after you've been exposed. It's probably different when you've actually had Covid. Also the common flue and Covid are so different, people have been exposed to the flu for hundreds of years and Covid is brand new. Nobody knows how it affects the body long term or what it does to people who have had it.</p>

        <p>What does that mean? What is a molecular test? I had the kind where you cough in your mouth and swab your cheeks. I’m hopefully going to get an antibody test soon too. By what I’ve read, once the antibodies show up, the risk of spreading it is gone.</p>
