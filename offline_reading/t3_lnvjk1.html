    <strong>The people that think they are the smartest are now the dumbest.</strong>
    <p><p>I've found that people that consider themselves knowledgeable debunk anything that goes against the mainstream narrative by googling something that goes along with their beliefs and doesn't read any of it. Then they refuse to research the opposing side at all. "oh thats been debunked" "oh you aren't doing research you just watched one youtube video" "oh you just want to be part of the counterculture". I'm venting right now but holy shit how dense do you have to be to not even entertain an idea that opposes your beliefs. I think being able to suspend disbelief in anything is a vital skill to learn new things. If you can't do that then how will you ever learn anything new. If you just spew what you already believe and never change then what point is it to be human? People have their heads wayyyy up their asses about "conspiracy theories" I don't think the majority of people that consider themselves smart realize just how stupid they have become by trusting authority. Authority doesn't care about you one bit. You would think people would understand that when we feed people terrible food that kills them with obesity and heart disease but then we shut down the entire world over a virus with a %99.98 survival rate.</p></p>

<p>Yes, and let's not forget that Google search results are quite manipulated nowadays. For example, search for mask-related phrases and you will have to dig for many pages to find a result that isn't 100% pro-mask. This happens with non-covid topics too. Also some videos, articles, etc. are being straight up scrubbed from the internet...</p>

        <p>I remember 10 years ago I could find anything on Google with a simple search. These days I have to use DuckDuckGo a lot of times. Even with nonpolitical mundane stuff, the algorithm seems to spillover</p>

        <p>When I see people using google instead of duckduckgo I know they are blissfully ignorant to just how bad censorship has gotten. You have to scroll like 5 pages down to get the same information that shows up first result on duckduckgo.</p>

        <p>I've thought about this a lot. People who are highly educated and touted and being the smartest sometimes get the idea that it means they know a lot about everything. The harsh reality of the world is that NO ONE is really THAT smart. Some people are really good and dedicate their lives to knowing a lot about one subject. Even more rare are people who know a lot about a couple subjects. But that's about it. Even 99.9% of doctors don't actually really know shit about coronaviruses. People need to stop appealing to authority and follow their heart and what they think is best for themselves and their family.</p>

        <p>Exactly. Following your heart and your true nature is so important. I know I rambled a bit in that post and I was very frustrated... I don't like being like that because its harder to get the message I'm trying to convey out properly. Science is far from perfect and will never know everything about the true nature of reality and thats fine. But you have to suspend disbelief to be able to understand why all these ancient cultures were believers of some sort of higher power. I don't know what I don't know but I also know I don't know things. This mentality lets me more easily learn from others but then again people are all different and different ways of thinking are fine. Some people take years and years to make any significant growth I need to be more patient with others. Some people are still working on acquiring a growth mindset and many may never do that but thats fine as well. It isn't my place to tell people they are wrong only to do my best to share what I believe to be true. Love will always be the most powerful human emotion no matter how much hate tries to take over. Love has been felt by every human throughout history and will always be a huge part of us. Thanks for the comment I appreciate the sentiment especially with valuing family, family is super important to me.</p>

        <p>Exactly. I was pretty disillusioned about a university professor that I used to look up to. She ran a "fact check" and said: I found out in 5 seconds that what you're saying is garbage. And I said: Shouldn't you spend MORE than 5 seconds to check out something like this? </p>

        <p>Because they stopped scrutinising "tHe siEnCe" and just went all-in on appeal to authority neo-Marxist emotional politics solutions. Simplifying globally complex issues to absolute pseudo-maxims without proper consideration of trade-offs leads to a dumb down society eventually manifesting itself in the tragedy of the commoner, where people ignorantly vote themselves into slavery.</p>

        <p>People who aren’t accustomed to mistakes and are afraid of such have no right to determine what is right and wrong. I haven’t learned everything, I’ve made mistakes, I’ve been wronged, I’ve done others wrong. I know I can be wrong, I know I’m not perfect, I know I’m not the only sentient thing in my world. I think about what others have grown through, so when I stand by these beliefs, I have a damn good reason to.</p>
