    <strong>For anyone who supports mandatory vaccinations or proof of vaccinations to participate in daily life, I have a serious question for you.....</strong>
    <p><p>...what happens when your employer, your favorite restaurant, the public transportation operator and your doctors receptionist starts asking for your depression diagnosis card or your bipolar treatment card or your proof of no STDs or AIDS card? What will the reaction be then? I can make a case that people who suffer from mental health issues or who have STDs or HIV could very well be a danger to my health and the health of others. If I can make that case, so can the people who are thinking about the implementation of mandatory vaccinations and/or vaccine passport cards. </p>
<p>This is the door that is being opened. Once we walk through it there is no going back. If you think it can't, you aren't paying attention. </p>
<p>So, what will you say when you have to prove you have never been or are not depressed or have never had to see a shrink for bipolar disorder or that you don't have herpes or have never had the clap, just to be able to sit down at your favorite place to have lunch or to keep your fucking job? Are you going to accept it, just like you are covid related vaccine mandates and the calls for vaccine passports?</p></p>

        <p>I really don’t think these people care. This vaccine push is a symptom of a much, much greater issue. I feel like you either understand body autonomy or you don’t. Some people just don’t care what they put in their bodies so don’t understand why we would reject this. </p>
<p>You have to realize that many people have given up the power over their own bodies and health long before this, and placed it in the hands of the medical industry. The number of people (including children) on endless cocktails of prescription drugs consuming garbage food and media all day is great. These people took TWO doses of this “vaccine” without question.</p>

        <p>that one song by Kendrick Lamar "ADHD" he says "you know why we crack babies because we born in the 80's that ADHD crazy" in my opinion referring to the crack boom and also over diagnosis from doctors with adhd prescribing Ritalin to all the kids in the early 90s</p>

        <p>I was one of those ritalin kids. Caused severe depression once I hit puberty and anytime I brought it up to the doctor he just assumed I was lying.</p>
<p>Now people wonder why I am distrustful of injecting myself with unproven meds because some doctor somewhere said it was ok.</p>

        <p>When the disclosure of such information affects their social status or their ability to work, we will see how much they don't care. Not being vaccinated and being able to prove it, can and will destroy some people's lives. There are some of us who will never cave to the vaccination demands. Never. This is a hill I and many others will die on. Doing this will make it impossible to work, go shopping for food, participate in life as we always have, which will ruin many people's lives.  Living a normal life will be almost impossible. If proof of no STDs or proof of never seeing a shrink for something decides whether to can live normally and survive, I'm sure the people, calling for mandatory vaccines or proof of vaccination, aren't going to like this fact.</p>

        <p>I get what you are saying... but proof of those things will never happen though because both things (STDs and psychiatric issues) are profitable to the same corporations that are profiting off the vaccines.</p>
<p>So this disclosure really isn’t the “door being opened”. The door being opened IS mandatory medication.</p>

        <p>I don't know. I think a major objective right now is control. Gaining control of everyone who is lucky enough to live through this slow depopulation effort. I think control is necessary. Seeing the major corporations participate, openly, in the equity movement tells me a lot of things. I think the Cokes and Nikes and Victoria Secrets of the world have been told that doing business and making money are going to be done very differently if the reset is ever fully rolled out. The monetary system will change. The credit score system will change. Who is able to be in business and who is able to participate in the purchase of goods and services will be different. The new ESG score system will see that these things happen. So, the objective now, it seems, is to create as much division as humanly possible, conquer the dissident side of that division and gain as much possible control, over everyone on both sides, while doing so. Profits will come once the objectives are met. The establishment and their corporations will reap the rewards, as long as the participate in the operation.</p>

        <p>I can make a case that people with mental health issues have been responsible for many of our mass shootings, murders and violent attacks, for a very long time. It may not be the root cause of such a thing but, I'm willing to bet most of those responsible had some kind of mental health issue. I could convince plenty of people that mental health issues, when severe enough, could be a danger to all of us, in the work place and most other places. Just because this fact rarely brought to the forefront when a mass shooting or heinous murder happens, that doesn't mean it can't be argued on a vast scale.</p>

        <p>The streets of California are littered with mentally ill homeless people. A year &amp; a half ago, a pregnant woman in her early 20s was stabbed to death in broad daylight by a mentally ill homeless man. He had multiple felonies and after his last felony arrest, he was declared mentally incompetent &amp; unfit for trial so the wonderful state of California turned him loose! He’s already been declared mentally incompetent so that women’s family will never get justice.</p>

        <p>Did I say I was making a case champ? I said I COULD make a case. Could being the key word there. If the time ever came and I had to make a case, I would be able to make it. Reddit is not the place to make cases of any kind. Too many slow folks that don't read well.</p>

        <p>Interestingly enough, both covid-19 and aids attack our cells in the same way, by invading the ace-2 receptor. Why is it safe for me to have unprotected sex with someone with aids who's viral load is low enough to not be detected, but I have to fear asymptomatic transmission even from fully vaccinated people with masks?</p>

        <p>I'm not so sure it's been proven I can catch covid from someone sitting next to me. I know it's been said something like this can happen but, I don't know if it has actually been proven. It doesn't matter. Never before has a vaccine been forced upon the citizens of any country, in the way this one is. There has never been money offered to those who get inoculated. Donuts, sandwiches, weed or anything else like we have seen over the last few months. So, I don't think any of us should try to come up with reasons for why "something will never happen" in the future.</p>

        <p>It has happened 100s of times, in work environments and restaurants where one table has infected another and a couple of staff, on flights, this vaccine is not forced, 90% will gladly take the vaccine when they can get it, global pandemics are part of the human story but only come around every 100 years or so it's no wonder you haven't seen anything like this before</p>

        <p>Again a typical poorly educated American who can't see outside their country. Here in South Asia there have been government programs to reward people for taking the polio vaccine or smallpox vaccine for years. Just because you haven't seen something doesn't mean it doesn't exist.</p>

        <p>Poorly educated? That's an uneducated assumption you are making. </p>
<p>And, you are correct, I was not looking outside of the country I reside in, in this particular situation. Why would I want or need to? I was speaking only about where my family and I live. I don't need to know about the polio and small pox vaccine lotteries or coercion that's taken place in South Asia. I never claimed to be talking about where you or anyone else lives. I live in America. I know what has happened and is happening here. </p>
<p>Next time I will be sure to wave a flag or something. Or, would you like me to address each and every country individually? You tell me what would make you happy cupcake.</p>

        <p>&rt; I can make a case that people who suffer from mental health issues or who have STDs or HIV could very well be a danger to my health and the health of others.</p>
<p>No you can't make that case because it would be moronic. Why would a restaurant care if you had AIDS unless you plan to have unprotected sex with the waiters or you plan to cut yourself and bleed all over the place. Idiot.</p>

        <p>Same way I feel about the vaccine. It's unnecessary and unproven. You miss the point here though. And, I'm not going to waste time or energy helping you understand it.</p>

        <p>Are you even human? You respond with nonsense that has no connection to the discussion or point being made, just a mishmash of talking points.</p>
<p>Anyway. Enjoy being isolated and unemployed. The rest of the world isn't going to hold ourselves back because of a few selfish tantrum throwing children like you. Know that you are in the tiny tiny minority and eventually society will stop tolerating you.</p>
