    <strong>Just want to figure out if im a minority or majority in this group</strong>
    <p><p>1.I dont belive the covid vaccine is necessary 
2. I dont belive the covid vaccine is about putting  microchips people (or sterilization but I dont know enough on it )
3. I dont belive in vaccine passports and that rubbish (we don't have them for any other disease so why covid)
4. I think that the other vaccines like MMR and tetanus are ok and usefull and we have a lot of history to base their effectiveness on. </p>
<p>Not looking for trouble just wana see the general views of you lot and I'll read all comments.</p></p>

        <p>I don't think it matters if you're the minority or majority. I think the point is to live the way you want to live, and let others do the same. It's about freedom of choice, and allowing everyone to do as they please without holding people to your own standards of living.</p>

        <p>You're not crazy. You are a sane person trying to survive in an insane society. We are manipulated in one way or another at every turn. The big question is how do we stop the agenda being pushed and even accepted by many, and reverse the damage done to our freedom, liberties, and virtues as beings of this planet over the centuries.</p>

        <p>I'm not even anti-this vax, I'm just anti- unnecessary intervention. I would encourage my 50+ year old obese dad to take it, but I as a 23 year old who exercises regularly and eats an overall healthy diet see no good reason to take it myself.</p>

<li>Agreed. Why be a ferret when you have a functioning immune system?</li>
<li>Mostly disagree: the US gov is no longer even trying to hide that it's seeking FDA approval for microchips to detect C19 -  <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/pentagon-scientists-develop-microchip-that-detects-covid-before-symptoms-when-placed-under-skin/ar-BB1fChwa">Pentagon scientists develop microchip that detects COVID before symptoms when placed under skin (msn.com)</a>. The fact that avowed eugenicists and advocates for population reduction have had their hands all over this from the onset makes me even more suspicious.</li>
<li>Agreed.</li>
<li>Completely disagree: the largest contributors - by far - of the global decrease in communicable diseases have been improved sanitation, access to clean water, improved diets and shelter. Here's an example of TB:  <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/34/3/521/682217">Commentary: Medicine, population, and tuberculosis | International Journal of Epidemiology | Oxford Academic (oup.com)</a></li>

        <p>Hi mate so first let me say im glad you have showed me some things I diddnt know about, i know how hard it is to convince some one of a new view as I'm not fully convinced by some of these things bit ill just add my 2pence so you can see another point of view </p>
<p>You said about how there is a potential microchip coming about regarding covid 19 and after checking the link im glad i learned the government is even considering it! However just my view I dont think its anythin that will come to fruition it probably just some ones "bright idea" that they have piched to the government to get a lovely paycheck and the government wont really find a way to utilize them but still ill keep an ear open for more info.</p>
<p>The Vax sites you shared are of reasonable quality Nd im glad you brought up issues other than the autism one , whilst these may be real issues I just have my point of view I guess that in general vaccines that we have in the UK have been doing good things , i know i cant change your mind on this so i won't press on but you still shared some information that ill look more  into , thank you</p>

        <p>Heya! Don't mention it! This is a platform where we can exchange ideas and compare notes. I don't try convince people that vaccines are dangerous - I simply give them information and assume that they have the critical thinking skills and intellectual ingenuousness to come to the same conclusion that I reached in my teenaged years. What made me question everything related to vaccines and prescription medication was discovering Pfizer's Trovan experiments on unsuspecting poor Nigerians. Being African, I found myself reading about the histories of these BigPharma entities and was able to see their strong connections to eugenics and racism. You really can't unsee that. I must admit that I am slightly disappointed that the world, even after 16 months of being deceived by the ExPeRtZ, isn't ready to question every other SETTLED SCIENCE^(TM) claims, including vaccines. I give you credit for being honest enough to be open to the idea of revising your long-held views about vaccines.</p>
<p>I have to disagree with your Panglossian view of the US government - or any government, to be honest - 16 months into this PaNdEmIc. If there's anything that you should have seen by now, it's that there's no depth that the degenerate TPTB and their political puppets are not willing to reach to control humanity. The fact that global central banks are already working on digital currencies should alarm everyone and show us where this is all headed.</p>
<p>It's interesting to hear that you're from the UK as I am from a former British colony and my first article was based on Welsh and English data from the 1700s until the 20th century. I'll admit that I haven't checked the MHRA's vaccine excipients (ingredients) list for a while, but if you want to read about the ethyl mercury in FDA-approved vaccines: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/mjuvfs/compilation_ethylmercury_in_vaccines_tldr_dubious/">Compilation: Ethylmercury in Vaccines</a>.</p>

        <p>Mabey i worded it wrong,  i belive any government (uk especially) would try anything to control their people I just don't think they are competent to lol , that's why i said the micro chips are just an idea, but your correct they will do anything to control the population,  i had hear about the microchips currency thing althou i dont know if its connected to the covid chip stuff , either way the bible says I shouldn't take the mark of the beast so both chips are off the table for me</p>

<p>Its not antivaxx to question this vaccine I'm not antivaxx in general but this one and the bloated media campaign behind it reminds me of the 76 Flu vaccine screw up. So ill wait for a bit and see how things turn out before blindly trusting a for profit industry that has been released from all liability if their product does turn out defective or harmful in some meaningful way.</p>

        <p>I think you’ve stated the majority position (be mindful that this group has been dominated by more extreme voices lately, which is to be expected as this drags on). </p>
<p>Anyone who’s been here since the beginning can confirm that the majority of folks opposed to lockdowns (and now vaccine mandates) are actually quite reasonable and evidence-based in their views - they’re just increasingly quiet, as almost every aspect of these issues has been covered to death and there’s little left to say (or they’re ranting, because they’re angry after a year of this and need to vent).</p>

<p>I’m not really into conspiracy theories, but the “Facts” that the main media are spreading dont make any sense. 
Every day, proof is coming out that the media is embellishing this whole thing. </p>
<p>I am especially concerned about Vaccine passports... for an experimental shot..?!</p>
<p>This sub is being falsely labeled and users are being censored simply because they are subscribed here... but when someone starts a thread with genuine questions rather than simply trolling, they are greeted with conversation and well minded arguments.</p>
<p>Censorship is a slippery slope to begin with, but Censoring someone simply because of association... does that sound normal to you?</p>

        <p>You don't need a conspiracy theory when your government is stripping away your rights before you. I'm not worried about being chipped, I'm worried about the implication of the government mandating forced vaccinations. This sets the precedent, and the notion, that you are quite literally as the definition states: a slave. If the ownership of your body informs property rights then it stands to reason that you cannot own anything if this is violated.</p>
<p>Here's an example. After this pandemic there will be a suicide pandemic. Suicide was out of control before it, and the way the government has forced people to act will have permanent psychological effects on people exacerbating this issue. Now that the government owns your body, to correct this problem they will see fit to administer things like anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, along with lithium into the water supply. The negative effects of this, just like your rights, will be brushed aside in the name of "the greater good". Perhaps after suicide, aggression will be the next pandemic, and so all men will have to submit to hormone therapy to artificially lower their testosterone levels, and so on, ad infinitum. </p>
<p>The radical sheep use "conspiracy theories" as an excuse to dismiss arguments. You will never see any of them question the scientific evidence and logical explanations we have offered to them in good faith, no doubt many people are here simply because they were banned from everywhere else by questioning the narrative with evidence to back up their claims. I've been banned and had mods personally just admit they had no reason to ban me and didn't care about the numerous scientific literature I gave them. A vaccine that is truly safe and effective doesn't need to rely on censorship to convince people to get it.</p>

        <p>He’s saying that the nature of your question suggests that you’ve bought into the false narrative constructed - you know, the one that says everyone who opposes lockdowns or mask mandates or doesn’t want the vaccine is an “anti-vaxxer” who is scared of 5G and thinks Bill Gates is out to get them. </p>
<p>However, the fact that you’ve chosen to even ask this question suggests that you are at least somewhat capable of, and willing to engage in, independent thought - so that’s something to be proud of, regardless of whatever views you may hold. Cheers!</p>

        <p>I think im like most of us here not being anti vaxx...i think if you are elderly and/or have health  conditions then you should take the shot. What really bothers me is how the media/big tech doesnt even allow for different opinions on unsettled science. No one wants to see unnecessary death, but you cant hide information from the masses because it doesnt agree with your agenda.</p>

        <p>You basically have the same view as me. </p>
<p>I would add that I think covid vaccination is a good thing for the elderly, the immunocomprimised who can have it, and those around them. </p>
<p>My dad isn't very healthy overall so I'm getting vaccinated and encouraging him to as I think it will be a better move for him.</p>
<p>But I look at it similar to the typical yearly flu, which is also very dangerous to the elderly, and as such extra precautions are taken if you want to visit a nursing home when the flu is running around.</p>
