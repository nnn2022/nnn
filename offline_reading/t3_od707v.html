    <strong>Attention Doomers/vaxxers, lend me one of the 4 ears you have now‚Ä¶</strong>
    <p><p>Ok so since March 2020, been running around doing whatever wearing a mask, following the rules, washing my hands till they bled, ect ect virtue this virtue that, ok.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs now July 2021, why am I not dead yet? You promised me death, and I looked forward to it, but yet nothing. Never got Corona vaccinated, didn‚Äôt do anything special cept ‚Äúsaying my prayers, eating my vitamins brother‚Äù and I‚Äôm still going.</p>
<p>So seriously what gives? Why am I not dead yet? I was told by you fellas many a time my death was imminent, I wasted a year on safety and hiding under the bed, what gives? </p>
<p>Am I gonna die soon? HowAbout that delta variant? I‚Äôm 45, I smoke and drink like a fish nowadays thanks to the version of normal you all love, hiding under the bed, living on Uber eats, counting my fat rolls, nothing. Not even a sniffle.</p>
<p>So how do I go about bringing a lawsuit into fruition to sue you Doomers and vaxxers for wasting a year and a half of my life I won‚Äôt get back? Fear mongering, ridicule, threats of death, I gotta get something out of it. </p>
<p>So the point is in this debacle, why am I still alive? Oh and taking the vaccine isn‚Äôt gonna happen, won‚Äôt get rid of me that easy. So explain. I want answers. I wanna count the belly flaps of a thousand Doomers to find out the answer.</p></p>

        <p>Peace and Blessings from Scotland xx I am also one of the walking dead. I was out in the streets of Glasgow waaaaaaay back at the beginning when they were EMPTY - with no mask, visiting my family member's house. I've never had a mask on and I'm out and about every day. How many people touch the hand sanitizer bottle on the way in to the shops? I ain't touching that after them. I've only had one incident where a shop assistant asked me to put  mask on, one that she manhandled. I ignored her and she served me anyways.</p>

<p>Edit: to be clear, I give no fucks about the people who died because they were caught up in propaganda and decided viruses are a hoax. That's literally survival of the fittest. But those that died because hospital beds were filled with idiots... that's genuinely sad.</p>

        <p>&rt;The vaccinated look upon us as plague rats. They have no respect for a persons personal decision.</p>
<p>You decided to be plague rats? Also, does this mean you're chill with abortion because it's a personal decision or is personal freedom a "move the goal posts" kind of deal. Also, when your personal freedom is both stupid and damaging to someone else's health you might not be treated kindly.</p>
<p>&rt;They brigade and harass us at every chance.</p>
<p>Who? And don't say people like me, I'm just struggling to understand your logic as is. Asking for clarification isn't harrassment and you'd be a snowflake to think so. You're not, but you would be.</p>
<p>&rt;Why would I want to get a shot to help them</p>
<p>You getting a vaccine only helps you, however it might save someone's life if you would have otherwise spread the sickness.</p>
<p>&rt;their vaccine won‚Äôt work unless I get one too</p>
<p>You're thinking of masks. Vaccines literally go <em>into your body</em>. Masks help others rather than yourself, which is clearly a problem.</p>
<p>Edit because it would be cool of you to actually respond to my points instead of jumping into some weird conspiracy you're terrified of. Vaxxers don't want you to die but they reeeeeally want you to use critical thinking skills because this shit affects EVERYONE</p>

<p>Critical thinking got me to the viewpoint I have now. I'm no genius and you still don't make sense.</p>

<p>Trump gave me a rimjob yesterday, but you can't have proof. But trust me it happened.
Who is calling you a plague rat? Outside of yourself, obviously.</p>
<p>&rt;I‚Äôm not getting the vaccine, I got one shot, made me sick, will not make a repeat performance.</p>
<p>Vaccines do that from time to time. It's a side effect of having a dead version of Covid injected into your veins. The slight sickness means your body is identifying and killing the disease, even if it's not a threat (dead viruses are not a threat, the vax is fine, trust me). You can get the same biological reaction by staying in a dusty room too long. Your insides don't like inhaling dirt. As a followup, exactly 7 people have died from the J&amp;J vaccine so far, all women with rare heart defects that weren't ready for the vaccine immune response. The doctors truly should have predicted it to some extent.</p>
<p>&rt;I wore a mask and still have to. Never did I once complain. </p>
<p>This post is a giant complaint.</p>
