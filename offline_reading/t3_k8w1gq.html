    <strong>Do you think I'd be able to get a medical exemption from the vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>Hey guys. I have a question that my parents and I are too afraid to ask doctors. I was wondering how possible it would be to get a medical exemption from the vaccine due to the long term side effects being relatively unknown. I had epilepsy for most of my life (up until like 3-4 years ago), and was able to skip out on a vaccine or two because seizures were listed as a side effect. The seizures I had were on the more mild side, but still managed to cause damage to my frontal lobe. I can only imagine how bad they would be if they were to come back now that my brain is significantly more mature and formed than it was when I was 5. I got lucky that the brain damage was in a spot that wasn't incredibly important. I might not be so lucky next time. I would much rather be on a ventilator than potentially be in a wheelchair for the rest of my life, and all these self righteous assholes are telling me the latter is obviously better and that I'm selfish because "at least grandma would be okay". I'm only 15 and having a bad cold for two weeks sounds much more tolerable than never be able to do anything on my own again for the rest of my life. Do you think any doctor would be able to make an exception? I am genuinely scared of what might happen if I get the vaccine.</p></p>
