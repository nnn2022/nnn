        <p>It’s fucking cold outside and I don’t want to be homeless again. I’m a senior level partner but I’m not a sole proprietor. I have 20 staff under me. 1 of them is anti-mask, 5 of them are loudly pro-mask, and the other 14 will go along with the mandate because the 5 vocal staff intimidate them. I also have about 12 investors whom I answer to. About half of them are adamantly pro-mask. And most just go along with the rules. One or two might not like them but they don’t speak up about it.</p>
<p>It would be nice in theory to turn my back on all of it, and not be a cog in the machine, but I am paying off enormous debts. I’m frail from a lifetime of illness and I can fully vouch that no one gave a shit about “protecting others” when <em>I</em> needed it. </p>
<p>This job affords me a warm place to stay, they respect that I do not wear a mask, but they insist that I allow my employees to enforce the mask policy with customers and my employees will mutiny and complain until I’m fired if I don’t. </p>
<p>They are all okay if I let customers who cannot mask in the shop after hours. But that just makes a long day for me. I’ll still do it, because I believe in providing service to people regardless of what’s on their face, but to pay the price of unemployment and no where to go right now... to be in the cold with less than 4K to my name and trying to figure how to put my things in storage and find another job when I don’t mask and everyone is being laid off anyway.</p>
<p>What the fuck am I supposed to do? The cold hurts my bones so bad. I really don’t think I could survive a month if I had to live in my car for awhile.</p>
