        <p>You make it sound like they purposely designed it NOT to prevent transmission. </p>
<p>I expect preventing transmission would be a primary goal of any vaccine "design". IMO it's very telling that the so called experts "don't know" what the vaccine does and does not do. </p>
<p>These experts are waiting to see what happens. We're in the middle of a vaccine experiment. The last time this happened was disastrous. The 1976 swine flu vaccine didn't work, and it injured thousands of people. </p>

        <p>My point is that transmission will be a secondary effect. The vaccine is supposed to cover multiple mutations in the spike proteins and should last longer than any immunity I have from illness - the secondary effect is that you’d be asymptomatic which is showing to be very rare for transmission.</p>

        <p>Why then are asymptomatic people currently being required to quarantine, wear masks, socially distance, prevented from gathering, prevented from travelling, and in many instances under house arrest ... etc. </p>
<p>Also, many sources say that vaccinated people will still be required to undergo all the same restrictions. Why is this?</p>

        <p>Because imo this has all become a political ploy. I hate being downvoted about my comment because I mean nothing negative about this post - I think it’s all lunacy. More research is coming out that asymptomatic spread is nearly impossible yet we’re being told we still NEED the vaccine even if we’ve already had covid. It’s all very confusing</p>

        <p>Studies say asymptomatic transmission is not a problem, for those that care to find and read them.</p>
<p>For the governments to say that via the media would be suicide for them, all the control measures relied on the belief of asymptomatic transmission.</p>
<p>In their defence, for most folks the virus is causing nothing more than cold or flu like symptoms, it's not progressing to the full on persistent cough, fever, respiratory disease COVOD-19 that it started out as. Those folks would be trotting around, with symptoms, saying "ah, it's just a cold" I don't have a deadly disease. They would then give it to granny and she may develop full on Covid-19.</p>
<p>Should that justify lockdowns etc, my opinion no, granny and her vulnerable know the dangers of catching it and those with love for granny and her pals care for her enough not to go near her even if they do have "just a cold".</p>
<p>Your opinion may vary.</p>

        <p>Totally agree. I was just talking my scenario thinking like they must be to save face and not be publicly executed.</p>
<p>Not picking sides just trying to make sense of the picture. </p>
<p>It'll be long game for many years like 9/11 trying to hold people to account for the reprocussuions.</p>
