    <strong>Before covid, have you ever been skeptical of scientific consensus to later be proven "right"?</strong>
    <p><p>Not counting anything coronavirus related, is there any example of something where you were skeptical of consensus scientific opinion only to later have the latest science shift to support what you originally believed?</p>
<p>For example, when I was in school, the scientific consensus was that there wasn't inter-breeding between Homo-sapiens and Neanderthals but after <a href="https://www.thevintagenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Anatomical-comparison-of-skulls-of-Homo-sapiens-left-and-Homo-neanderthalensis-right-640x349.jpg">comparing features of skulls</a> between the two, it seemed pretty clear that you can sometimes find the Neanderthal specific characteristics in the modern human skull and perhaps other features such as body hair. </p>
<p>Since then, the evidence that there was interbreeding has become so clear that there is no longer any disagreement that I am aware of but this always stuck with me because it was a clear illustration as to the dynamic nature of our understanding of the world.  </p>
<p>I don't have a degree in anthropology so maybe I just got lucky or something but regardless it was a great real-life example of how science is a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_evidence">empirical</a> method of acquiring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge">knowledge</a>" or process as opposed to something that we can look to as the arbiter of ultimate truths.</p></p>

        <p>These all seem to be in category of doomsday scenarios and it's hard to separate the media sensationalism from the actual science for me.</p>
<p>Another example I remember was how we were told that it was only a matter of time until the Africanized Killer Bees that escaped from a lab in South America would make it to the US and destroy our way of life.  Even though I am aware of that happening, I still can't help but be a little nervous by our new updated version of this (<a href="https://nypost.com/2021/03/18/murder-hornets-will-be-serious-danger-this-spring-scientists/">Murder Hornets)</a> because it sounds pretty fucked up at face value.</p>

        <p>So which climate change have we observed, the ice age or Manhattan under water?  For not being able to predict the future, the politicians would seem to disagree. They are predicting that the only way to stop climate change is through higher taxes. Because there is only one thing the climate respects, and that is redistribution of wealth.</p>

        <p>No. Show me any definitive proof that CO2 is the cause of climate change. Just like covid1984, they keep moving the goal post and why are all the solutions to climate change socialism?</p>

        <p>Wow. That's a bizarre response.</p>
<p>So first off, climate change has always happened and will continue to happen. Sometimes these changes are stable for thousands of years and sometimes for millions of years. Surely you've heard the term "ice age."  Well... that changed.</p>
<p>There's not a lot humans can do to stop climate change.</p>
<p>Right now what <strong>WE ARE OBSERVING</strong> is that we're accelerating the warming phase of climate change.  There's no one thing we can point to as being the cause, and we will most likely not be able to prove it rigorously.  We do know about greenhouse gases, experiments that even a child can do will demonstrate that they emit heat when they absorb infrared light. We also know that we are producing more and more greenhouse gases as a side effect of industry and energy production.  We are also reducing the earth's ability to reabsorb some of that carbon by clearcutting large areas of forest.</p>
<p>But climate change isn't the only consequence of greenhouse gases. You're gonna love ocean acidification.  The majority of our oxygen is produced by things living in the ocean.  We kill the forests, we kill the ocean, the future is looking bright.</p>
<p>You know we laugh and say "haha remember when science said that cigarettes were ok and even doctors recommended them?" and then science advances and then we're like "well... we were wrong."  That's where we are with climate change, and just like lung cancer, we're gonna care only after it's too late to do anything about it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there are no solutions to climate change, well, maybe reducing the population ;)</p>

        <p>The earth has been around 4.5 billion years, we humans have existed for around 300,000 years, <em>maybe</em>  400,000 at a stretch. Sure the climate is changing. Sure we have contributed in some small ways. But just as not all forest fires are started by humans, not all of climate change is humans fault. Takeaway point: Let nature take it's fucking course. It's been here longer than us, and will probably be here long after we're all gone.</p>

<p>50 years of bad predictions and your moron ass still believes it. How many times do they have to keep moving the goal posts before you believe they lied about this too. 
Also ocean acidification isn't a thing...its another desperate attempt to keep climate change relevant.</p>

        <p>I think the blanket term "climate change" is not specific enough to have a meaningful debate.  You can recognize that some of the worst case scenario predictions have not come to pass and still acknowledge that there are measurable changes that we should be concerned about.</p>

        <p>The difficulty in accurately predicting the behavior of complex systems is perhaps at the core of these types of issues.  Here is an <a href="https://letstalkscience.ca/educational-resources/stem-in-context/why-weather-so-hard-predict">interesting article</a> that covers the topic.</p>
<p>Basically the high level explanation is:</p>
<ul>
<li>the amount of available data;</li>
<li>the time available to analyze it; and</li>
<li>the complexity of weather events.</li>

        <p>The whole validity. I think dinosaurs were dragons. With the avian connection it makes sense. And the fact that other than skulls, not many actual dino bones have been found. This would make sense again as avian bones are light and brittle and would fully decompose not fossilize, leaving only skull and teeth. 
So after finding dino skulls paleontologists basically made up, creatively I might add, the rest of the dino bodies and characteristics.
Don't hold me to all of this lol. Just tidbits of this I remember reading and thinking wtf? But when I was a kid I called dinosaurs dragons and it's always stuck with me.</p>

        <p>Yes, it was the global warming nonsense for me. I knew it was a political lie in the 6th grade. None of the warnings came true in the slightest. Saddest part is that over a decade later they’ve just moved the goalposts again and still refuse to admit they’re wrong. And people still fall for it. AGAIN. How did my 11 year old self know that Al Gore just wanted money and attention for his political career and yet grown adults to this day don’t get it?</p>

        <p>Modern science is governed by Karl Popper's falsification principle, which essentially states that if contradictory evidence is found, the theory is discarded. This backfires to some extent, as a lot of ideas are thrown out the window in favour of whichever mainstream theory can hold up the longest, rather than taking a nuanced approach that allows for variability under different conditions.</p>

        <p>yeah, allergies and cleanliness.   the prevailing view was that you avoid things that you are allergic to and take medication.  I did the opposite and now have no animal allergies and hay fever.  also dont wash my hands and will eat food off ground.  never get sick either.  seems obvious to me that humans evolved in dirty environments so why would a sanitised one be good for you?</p>

        <p>Hah. I am the same way and seem to get sick less often and severe than most people.  Maybe a coincidence.</p>

        <p>Once when I was about 10 or 11, my mom and my much older sister (she would've been 27 at the time), were talking about participating in an aids research walk. Me, wanting to give my sister a hard time, cause you know annoying kid age, said sarcastically "well maybe you can find a boyfriend there". She rolled her eyes before in all seriousness saying " well obviously not, all the guys there are gay". She wasn't at all close minded, that was just the common knowledge "facts" at the time. While I didn't have an understanding of stds or anything like that since I was still a kid, I remember quite consciously thinking -yeah...that doesn't sound right..</p>

        <p>Yes in the late 90s and early 00s before the big internet and all the conspiracy theories became populair, people already used to talk about it occasionally in bars and cafes or with friends.</p>
<p>It was just about the bigger picture of how much money is circulating in big pharma, and they basically make money by people being sick. And how scientists were funded by them. </p>
<p>Butchers approving their own meat, is a common phrase in my language.</p>

        <p>Jeez. If you are old enough there are buckets of examples.</p>
<p>I remember science texts that taught three competing cosmological theories</p>
<p>1) Steady state.  The universe has always looked like this and always will</p>
<p>2) Steady state with expansion.  That Hubble trouble maker does seem to make a point.  Matter is being continuously created at the center of the universe and is disappearing at the far end.</p>
<p>3) The "Big Bang"  silly name, very unlikely. </p>
<p>I remember books in the library proving that space rockets could not work because they had nothing to "push" against. </p>
<p>I had a science teacher (nun in a Catholic school) who taught us that men have one fewer rib than women. Adam's rib.</p>
<p>In college I had an adviser who steered me away from artificial intelligence research because any neural net more than one level deep was computationally impossible.   </p>
<p>I was also taught that real time 3-D ray tracing for graphics could never happen. </p>
<p>In the '70s it was a common consensus that the earth could not support a population of over 3 Billion and that food riots were imminent.   That is, if the new Ice Age coming didn't get us first.</p>
<p>Getting back to space (I was a space geek) both Mars and Venus were probably habitable, but Mars would require supplemental air and Venus was probably soggy and water covered. </p>
<p>There will never be a demand for more than 4 or 5 real computers in the world. But they might be small enough to fit inside a single floor of a building. </p>
<p>Vitamin C can cure the common cold, cancer, I forget what else. </p>
<p>Memory regression through hypnosis can legitimately cause people to remember past lives (Bridey Murphy)</p>
<p>Evolution (if you accept it) requires millions and millions of years to make detectable changes.  Cue punctuated equilibrium. </p>
<p>Oh, I nearly forgot.  Protons, neutrons, electrons.  They are basic particles with no constituent parts.   We'll figure out those pesky Leptons real soon now. </p>
<p>Now a few of these may not have been wide consensus, but all were believed by huge numbers of people.</p>
