    <strong>I feel like I'll be all alone soon enough..</strong>
    <p><p>I know I have this group, but I can't even prove any of You are real. </p>
<p>When the vax was first released my dad and brother rushed out to get theirs. They live next door to my Grandma &amp; I, and my aunt and uncle live behind them. We own a corner in the county. My aunt and uncle in Florida, who were against it, got theirs just over a month ago because they're 'sick of masks and want to do things.' The aunt who lives near me just got her first one. </p>
<p>Today I came home and Grandma (whom was also against it) tells me she got her first one. Her reasoning is also 'because she's sick of masks.' Not the typical Grandma, though. Just turned 72 and we rode our motorcycles 162 miles on her birthday! ... I am quite worried now.</p>
<p>I fear it's only a matter of time before everyone 'gets sick of masks' and decides to inject themselves. I'm going to start digging a hole to sit it I guess.</p></p>

        <p>We need to mobilize world wide, we need to get together, car pool, wear t shirts that read "Don't Believe the Covid Narrative" etc</p>
<p>We need each other.</p>
<p>At some point I believe we will have to group up in our cities/towns and form watch groups to protect our selves.</p>

        <p>I am also alone in this. I have people teasing me about being against the vaxxx. Friends even send me articles that say people who don't get it have lower intelligence. It just makes me really sad. My bf got it, and he thinks I am crazy. I am angry at the government and the elite for doing this to us. I just wish everything was normal again.</p>

        <p>Yeah my dad really likes saying the classic "You're not important enough to get chipped and tracked." Like.. nah, there are multiple reasons I'm not into it and it's clearly pointless to explain them. </p>
<p>I hate that we have to feel this way! I have a feeling it won't get much better in the foreseeable future. I've got some rollerskates coming in about 6 weeks so my only plan is to just roll around and act like I don't have a care in the world. I hope You find something to forget how scary the world is too!</p>

        <p>Thank you, I really appreciate your nice words. I am trying my best to stay positive but sometimes it gets hard. Hopefully we are wrong and we will all get out of this soon, we just need to stay strong.</p>
