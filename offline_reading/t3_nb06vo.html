    <strong>Alarming thought: How many recipients of the jab aren’t reporting their side effects due to not wanting the skeptics to “win”.</strong>
    <p><p>The topic of the jab is causing such a division between the sheep and the skeptics that the sheep’s egos won’t let them admit that the skeptics have every right to be skeptical. They look at reporting side effects as a “win” for skeptics. </p>
<p>What sparked this idea what that my sister has been getting a messed up period and I asked her why she isn’t reporting it. She told me she doesn’t want the “anti vaccers” to win. She is totally brainwashed. I wonder how many other people feel this way?</p></p>

        <p>I hear so many people IRL talking about the side effects.  My gf isn't down with nnn like me but even she says she still feels fucked up from her Pfizers almost a month later.  I her talking to her coworkers too saying similar kinds of things.</p>
<p>It sounds like they don't really tell you what to expect.</p>

        <p>Many people know they aren't right and don't want to admit it. I have customers like that. One guy, a retired teacher from New York, looks like has aged 10 years since the shot. And he is, was, a very healthy 65 year old. There's something way different about him now. His whole persona changed. It's weird.</p>

People cling to their decision only because they already invested. You can see it literally everywhere.

        <p>It's all about the money. </p>
<p>Step 1. Attribute more deaths than what's really happened to scare people in order to control them as best as possible. This makes people more prone to accept the vaccine and help big pharma make billions in profit.</p>
<p>Step 2. Attribute less deaths than normal from the vaccine, so you don't scare people into not taking the vaccine, as that would hit big pharma profits considerably.</p>
<p>I work in a multi-national blue chip company and it's exactly how we operate.</p>

        <p>I haven't personally been able to verify this, but I heard from a doctor (I think it was Peter McCullough?) that a similar thing happened with one of the vaccines in the stage II clinical trials.</p>
<p>Apparently the people who received the vaccine knew that they didn't receive a placebo due to experiencing side effects, but didn't report them as they wanted the vaccines to be approved.</p>

        <p>This is definitely possible, also a shitload of them on reddit are bots.</p>
<p>Ever wonder how when you talk to people face to face 90% don't believe in the covid shit and nobody you know irl has had really bad effects or died? Yet online every person knows 100 people that died, entire families are decimated, and 99% of people are pro lockdown/pro experimental gene therapy?</p>
<p>I do know a lot of people who have gotten vaccinated at this point, tons with awful effects, and every single one of them only got the jab because they want to travel.</p>

<p>I know far more who have gotten vaccinated and while several had awful side effects (enough that others in our group skipped the second shot), I don’t know do anyone who had to be hospitalized or treated for vaccine side effects.</p>

        <p>I hadn't heard any of the folks who had mocked people's concern about engaging in a clinical trial mention any adverse affects before hearing of their passing.</p>
<p>So, yeah, even in the face of death, they kept quiet. Others, like DMX, whose girlfriend says it was due to the vaccine, in the papers it doesn't get mentioned and certainly won't make it into any record keeping.</p>
<p>A Health official in BC said that they will not investigate any vaccine deaths since vaccine's don't cause death. In other places, I'm sure they are being labelled as covid deaths: Seychelles, 2 deaths during covid; 26 deaths since the vaccine program began.</p>

        <p>I have had the 2 Pfizer injections, taken on my own free will. The second shot gave me chills 24 hours after getting it and lethargic after 24 hours. Both hit at the same time. I was ok after 12 hours after that. </p>
<p>I reported them as there is a questionnaire the government sends out asking if you have had any side affects. Chills and lethargic was one of the options. They then sent out another follow up questionnaire to see how long it lasted or if I was ok.</p>

        <p>I was just talking to a nurse the other night on why she thinks Dr's are not reporting side effects. She did say that the Dr that was dismissive of side effects from the vaccine, she said it was due to meds the guy already had been on for years and never had a problem with, was also vaccinated. So literally in denial because then she would have to admit maybe she had made a mistake in taking the vaccine too.</p>

        <p>I personally don't know anyone who has died or had serious effects from the vaccine or covid. And seems like most of my clients lately have had the vaccine. One thing i keep thinking is we can't apply the same bullshit logic that they used for covid and apply it to the vaccines. Don't get me wrong, I don't trust the vaccines at all, but if it was bullshit for covid it's still bullshit for the vaccines.</p>

        <p>You realize this is the internet right? It’s not like I’m writing a book or an essay. I think you’re the one that has a foam helmet, especially when you’re investing your money on useless things like action figures, instead of trying to upgrade from the same job you’ve had for 3 years. Ofc there’s nothing wrong w having a job for 3 years, but when your job is an entry level job it’s quite sad. Then you’ll be the same guy who complains that the rich shouldn’t be where they’re at and that you need the government to breast feed you.</p>

        <p>Hahahahahahahahahaha. It’s so good. Weak justification for a lack of ability to communicate effectively in a written medium and then an attempt to feel better about yourself by listing things you stalked my profile to find out, as I’d they’re somehow bad. Which, I’m unsurprised that you are not getting correct as well as making a lot of baseless assumptions about. Please keep it up. This is gold.</p>

        <p>I am smart. The kind of selfishness and fear it takes to believe that the unfortunately vocal minority of people who can’t face reality are right, and that the world’s leading scientists and medical professionals are wrong just to justify sticking your head in the sand is staggering. I’ll let ya in on something, kiddo. The whole rest of the world isn’t pretending all this up just to infringe upon your personal freedoms. You haven’t the self awareness or the intellectual capacity to even realize how mind bogglingly ignorant you sound when you talk about this.</p>

        <p>I’m pretty sure I communicated effectively tho, you were able to understand what I was saying right? I didn’t stalk your profile, literally anyone can go and look at your profile. What am I not getting correct? I did make assumptions I’m not gonna lie. Btw I saw one of your posts about you making a story w your action figures which I thought was pretty cool, especially if you were to make a short film.</p>
