        <p>Interesting. So if the vaccine was 100% effective in stopping infection and death, would you be on board with businesses mandating it?</p>
<p>I'd be interested to see the data you are referring to. From what I have seen, it significantly reduces the risk of severe infection that leads to hospitalization or death.</p>

        <p>First of all, Dr. Robert Malone did not invent mRNA vaccines. He published a single study that did help contribute to mRNA vaccine development, but the invention of the mRNA vaccines is usually credited to Dr. Katalin Karik√≥ and her collaborator Dr. Drew Weissman.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it has been researched and debunked as a possible concern at this point. If it was an issue we would have seen cases of it by now. But we haven't.</p>

<p>To me that sounds like businesses acting in their own interest, right? Business is better when there is not a pandemic raging. Vaccinations mitigate the pandemic. So we should try to vaccinate our employees. How is this coercive?</p>

<p>During a pandemic, any responsible government would institute a shutdown to reduce the damage of the disease. </p>
<p>Shutdowns are bad for business.</p>
<p>Vaccinations offer a way to mitigate transmission of the disease, thus reducing the likelihood of a shutdown. </p>
<p>So in order to prevent losing money, a business makes vaccines mandatory. This is entirely in the self interest of the business. The government isn't instituting a shutdown to punish a business, they institute a shutdown in response to an unchecked pandemic.</p>
<p>Also, tax breaks are hardly bribes. Do you consider tax breaks for businesses using green energy a bribe?</p>

        <p>No. Your second paragraph is completely wrong. That is not in any way responsible. No government should have the power, authority, and ability to do that. There are other methods that could and should be used, but not that one.</p>
<p>To humor you how businesses are acting at the behest of the government with these mandates, it is because of those the governments are regulating and requiring the businesses to run. Being in California, when the mask mandates were lifted, they created a two class system with regards to who must and could not wear masks. Now, if you are unvaccinated and catch Covid you must quarantine for 2 weeks before returning to work, even with negative tests. If you are unvaccinated and spent more than 15 minutes with someone who tested positive you must quarantine for, I believe, 10 days before returning to work. Even with negative tests. If you are vaccinated and test positive you can return to work with 2 negative tests, even if it is just 1 day after your positive test. If you are vaccinated and come in contact with someone who tests positive for any amount of time, it doesn‚Äôt matter you can keep working. </p>
<p>There are policies beyond that, but this is one I just dealt with at my workplace so I‚Äôm aware of it. These policies that the state is passing down is the only reason my work gives a shit about vaccines. The only reason we cared about masks is because if we didn‚Äôt we could get shut down. The state had random inspectors showing up threatening to shut us down if they found even customers without masks being worn properly.</p>

        <p>I guess I would be interested in hearing what the government should do to stop a pandemic that doesn't involve shutdowns and vaccine mandates.</p>
<p>Your point about the government regulating businesses for mask adherence and vaccination doesn't seem like a problem to me. The government should be allowed to shut down a business if it risks the health of it's patrons. They already do it for other things. For example, there are safety standards for restaurants to ensure food is prepared and served safely. How is requiring masks different?</p>

        <p>Just no...knew you were a branch covidian.</p>
<p>Covid is a cold with an IFR of 0.15% and a survival rate of 99.85%. Smart people aren't afraid of it. The common flu has an IFR of 0.1%. Most of the links below are either from Cambridge, MIT, the CDC or the WHO. Most of rest of peer reviewed medical journals and white papers by epidemiologists/ scientists so people cant use the fringe source cop out.</p>
<p>Tom Woods actually was talking about the masks causing an increase in cases early on...as highlighted by the Fauci emails. That video: https://vimeo.com/483358807</p>
<p>Social  distancing doesn't work by MTI, literally says 6ft or 60ft doesn't matter.</p>
<p>https://www.businessinsider.com/6-ft-social-distancing-rule-exposure-indoors-2021-4</p>
<p>Mask mandates dont work:</p>
<p>These are just some articles about masks:  not .gov links or peer reviewed studies so take them with a grain of salt:</p>

<p>Now for the more medical journal type stuff on masks (most of these are referenced in the white paper in the next section, some say they work and some say they don't...what they all show is the mandates are worthless)</p>

<p>In the US if your below 70 your survival rate is 99.68%. The risk is minimal at best and way overblown. Did you know 95% of covid deaths are 80+ years old and half those died in nursing homes? For being such a super deadly virus it sure has no teeth. </p>

<p>https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2021/jun/27/why-most-people-who-now-die-with-covid-have-been-vaccinated</p>
<p>People dying from the vaccine itself:</p>
<p>https://covid-101.org/science/how-many-people-have-died-from-the-vaccine-in-the-u-s/</p>
<p>Your entire argument is but 600k died and believe the experts! Yeah they did...4 million world wide. Out of a population of 7.674 billion. That a raw mortality rate of less than 0.05%...the experts have been lying and have flip flipped so many times it's ridiculous.</p>
<p>Already posted the survival rate by age group for the US. It'd 99.68% for anyone under 70. 95% of covid deaths are  people above 70 and half of those were from nursing homes. Nursing homes I might add that leftist governors like those of NY, NJ, MI, etc...put active covid patients in nursing homes. Ramping the numbers sky high.  So can we blame democrats for that? </p>
<p>Also why aren't they separating died with covid from died from covid? They do this with every respiratory illness known to man. Also why have we been keeping the clock ticking for 20 months now? Most colds go by a yearly cycle. Imagine if I did that to other diseases. Tb for example kills an average of 1.5 million people globally a year...if I kept the clock running for TB for 20 months that's 2.5 million dead.</p>
<p>We should have never shut down. UN estimates that 22-138 million are going to starve this year because of the lockdowns and interruptions in the global economy. That's over 5-35x the number that has died from covid. </p>
<p>https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/07/13/890398347/u-n-report-says-pandemic-could-push-132-million-people-into-hunger</p>
<p>https://unglobalcompact.org/take-action/20th-anniversary-campaign/covid-related%20hunger-could-kill-more-people-than-the-virus</p>
<p>Don't see you virtue signaling about that...</p>
<p>We flattened the curve. Actually cases and deaths have been on the downtrend...especially as states have opened up. Florida and Texas are doing great. Florida never locked down and they have the most elderly per capita and still faired better than most of the heavy lockdown states. </p>
<p>This whole your gonna kill grandma thing is a joke. If covid was sooooo deadly than why have we caught democrat politicians ignoring thier own lockdown orders?</p>
<p>https://www.businessinsider.com/democratic-politicians-who-violated-covid-19-rules-guidance-list-2020-12</p>
<p>Also if the virus was such a big deal than why were the BLM "protests" permitted to happen for over a year? Media and the medical establishment tried to gaslight us and tell us those "protests" didn't spread covid. </p>

<p>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-anti-lockdown-protests-spread-us-mobile-data-a9520561.html</p>
<p>If the vaccine worked than 1) how are vaccinated people getting and spreading covid? 2) why is Pfizer now talking about you have to take antivirals for covid after you take thier vaccine? 3) why is the cdc recommending masks for vaccinated people?</p>
<p>They lied and people like you got played.</p>
<p>And yes tax incentives for green energy are bribes. Thats what a tax incentive is...</p>

        <p>Okay I am going to read through your links. But first could you just explain why the excess death rate increased during the pandemic? If COVID was actually not as deadly as the media made it out to be, it stands to reason that the weekly deaths since the start of the pandemic would reflect the expected death totals based on previous years. But there was a spike in deaths during the pandemic. To me this seems like obvious evidence that COVID is a deadly virus. </p>
<p>To answer your questions about the vaccine: 1) vaccines don't stop infection, they prime your immune system to fight the virus. 2) breakthrough cases still happen with vaccines, so you should treat serious breakthrough cases like you would normal cases 3) because breakthrough cases occur, we want people to mitigate spread of the virus by using masks.</p>
<p>A bribe is usually illegal or at the very least dishonest. You're acting like paying someone to do literally anything at all is a bribe. Yeah the government uses tax breaks to incentivize certain behaviors, but it is not illegal or dishonest to do so.</p>

Don't wear masks, wear masks, wear 2 masks, the vaccinated need to wear masks, now no they dont, oops now they do again. All these examples were changed by the CDC with no studies to back them up. The changes are completely arbitrary and they are leading dumbfucks like you by the nose.</p>
<p>You are also an idiot...the covid1984 numbers aren't even real if they included flu numbers into it...fuck how can anyone be this stupid.</p>

        <p>Let's say we usually have about 60,000 deaths/week this time of year.  But instead we have 80,000 deaths/week. Doesn't this extra 20,000 deserve explanation?</p>
<p>I think most of the people you are talking about are actually profiting from "fighting the narrative." It's easy to sell books when you say something controversial. </p>
<p>Science doesn't change - it's findings can change. As we learned new information, we changed recommendations. I don't see anything wrong with changing our recommendations based on new info.</p>

        <p>Dude just stop. You are doing what's called moving the goal posts. You just got your ass handed to you and now you are trying to create "scenarios" that would make you right. Thats not how this works as the reality of covid isn't what your fictitious worldview makes it out to be. The survival rate is over 99.8t% across all demographics. Most of the people that have died from covid were over 80 years old...the common cold could have killed these people.</p>
<p>Actually science does change as settled science and scientific consensus is used to push a political narrative. We changed recommendations because it was convenient for the cdc and big pharma. The cdc is funded by big pharma so the cdc will basically say whatever Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson tell them to say. The mask mandate changes had no scientific backing as they did t even present evidence as go why they changed thier policy. </p>
<p>Here‚Äôs what¬†Michael Crichton¬†had to say about ‚Äúscientific consensus‚Äù back in 2003 when he gave a lecture at the California Institute of Technology titled ‚ÄúAliens Cause Global Warming":¬†¬†</p>
<p>"I want to pause here and talk about this notion of consensus, and the rise of what has been called consensus science. I regard consensus science as an extremely pernicious development that ought to be stopped cold in its tracks. Historically, the claim of consensus has been the first refuge of scoundrels; it is a way to avoid debate by claiming that the matter is already settled. Whenever you hear the consensus of scientists agrees on something or other, reach for your wallet, because you‚Äôre being had.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs be clear:¬†the work of science has nothing whatever to do with consensus. Consensus is the business of politics.¬†Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world.¬†In science consensus is irrelevant. What is relevant is reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the consensus. There is no such thing as consensus science. If it‚Äôs consensus, it isn‚Äôt science. If it‚Äôs science, it isn‚Äôt consensus. Period.</p>
<p>In addition, let me remind you that the track record of the consensus is nothing to be proud of. Let‚Äôs review a few cases.In past centuries, the greatest killer of women was fever following childbirth. One woman in six died of this fever. In 1795, Alexander Gordon of Aberdeen suggested that the fevers were infectious processes, and he was able to cure them. The consensus said no.</p>
<p>In 1843, Oliver Wendell Holmes claimed puerperal fever was contagious, and presented compelling evidence. The consensus said no.</p>
<p>In 1849, Semmelweiss demonstrated that sanitary techniques virtually eliminated puerperal fever in hospitals under his management. The consensus said he was a Jew, ignored him, and dismissed him from his post. There was in fact no agreement on puerperal fever until the start of the twentieth century. Thus the consensus took one hundred and twenty five years to arrive at the right conclusion despite the efforts of the prominent ‚Äúskeptics‚Äù around the world, skeptics who were demeaned and ignored. And despite the constant ongoing deaths of women.</p>
<p>There is no shortage of other examples. In the 1920s in America, tens of thousands of people, mostly poor, were dying of a disease called pellagra. The consensus of scientists said it was infectious, and what was necessary was to find the ‚Äúpellagra germ.‚Äù The US government asked a brilliant young investigator, Dr. Joseph Goldberger, to find the cause. Goldberger concluded that diet was the crucial factor. The consensus remained wedded to the germ theory.</p>
<p>Goldberger demonstrated that he could induce the disease through diet. He demonstrated that the disease was not infectious by injecting the blood of a pellagra patient into himself, and his assistant. They and other volunteers swabbed their noses with swabs from pellagra patients, and swallowed capsules containing scabs from pellagra rashes in what were called ‚ÄúGoldberger‚Äôs filth parties.‚Äù Nobody contracted pellagra.</p>
<p>The consensus continued to disagree with him. There was, in addition, a social factor-southern States disliked the idea of poor diet as the cause, because it meant that social reform was required. They continued to deny it until the 1920s. Result-despite a twentieth century epidemic, the consensus took years to see the light.</p>
<p>Probably every schoolchild notices that South America and Africa seem to fit together rather snugly, and Alfred Wegener proposed, in 1912, that the continents had in fact drifted apart. The consensus sneered at continental drift for fifty years. The theory was most vigorously denied by the great names of geology-until 1961, when it began to seem as if the sea floors were spreading. The result: it took the consensus fifty years to acknowledge what any schoolchild sees.</p>
<p>And shall we go on? The examples can be multiplied endlessly. Jenner and smallpox, Pasteur and germ theory. Saccharine, margarine, repressed memory, fiber and colon cancer, hormone replacement therapy. The list of consensus errors goes on and on.</p>
<p>Finally, I would remind you to notice where the claim of consensus is invoked.¬†Consensus is invoked only in situations where the science is not solid enough.¬†Nobody says the consensus of scientists agrees that E=mc2. Nobody says the consensus is that the sun is 93 million miles away. It would never occur to anyone to speak that way."</p>
<p>Related: From John Kay‚Äôs 2007 op-ed ‚ÄúScience is the pursuit of the truth, not consensus‚Äú:</p>
<p>The notion of a monolithic ‚Äúscience,‚Äù meaning what scientists say, is pernicious and the notion of ‚Äúscientific consensus‚Äù actively so. The route to knowledge is transparency in disagreement and openness in debate. The route to truth is the pluralist expression of conflicting views in which, often not as quickly as we might like, good ideas drive out bad. There is no room in this process for any notion of ‚Äúscientific consensus.‚Äù</p>

        <p>I am not moving the goal posts. I asked you from the outset why there has been an increase in total deaths. I linked you a report showing this is the case. And you have not been able to respond. Honestly, I would like to know why there has been an increase in deaths if the virus isn't deadly.</p>
<p>I don't disagree with a lot of your points about scientific consensus - this is philosophy of science 101. But I never claimed that we should follow scientific consensus. I'm saying that we should listen to the experts in a field when we have questions about that field. And if most of the them agree on the answer, then that is the best we have to go off of at the time. We are not trained to interpret public health studies, virology, epidemiology, etc. These are the jobs of the experts. </p>
<p>You may say this is a fallacious appeal to authority, but not all appeals to authority are fallacious. I put my trust in demonstrably credible sources, while you refer to sources that don't even have a self-correcting mechanism like peer review to hold itself accountable. I know peer review has its issue, but having a paper peer reviewed is leaps and bounds better more reliable than a random person making claims on the internet. You seriously need to just be more thoughtful about what you are being skeptical of and what things you choose to put your trust in. To me it seems backwards.</p>

        <p>Yes yes you are and have been trying this entire time. It's a common tactic used by sociopaths and socialists. You also have a massive appeal to authority fallacy. I used your own gods numbers against you and you still cling onto the belief that covid is a mega virus, mask mandates and lockdowns work and that the scientific community is almost God like with rhier peer reviewed bullshit. I've been thoughtful and have linked to studies and such that support my claims. You have not. What you do is appeal to emotions and when get smacked down by an obviously superior intelligence...that the you need to he more mindful bullshit. No I don't. I donr have to do shit and I don't have to care about your feelings. You are wrong and have been this entire time...period. the organizations you worship provide data that doesn't fit your worldview. Cope you moron.</p>
<p>Your entire argument is but 600k died and believe the experts! Yeah they did...4 million world wide. Out of a population of 7.674 billion. That a raw mortality rate of less than 0.05%...the experts have been lying and have flip flipped so many times it's ridiculous.</p>
<p>Already posted the survival rate by age group for the US. It'd 99.68% for anyone under 70. 95% of covid deaths are  people above 70 and half of those were from nursing homes. Nursing homes I might add that leftist governors like those of NY, NJ, MI, etc...put active covid patients in nursing homes. Ramping the numbers sky high.  So can we blame democrats for that? </p>
<p>Also why aren't they separating died with covid from died from covid? They do this with every respiratory illness known to man. Also why have we been keeping the clock ticking for 20 months now? Most colds go by a yearly cycle. Imagine if I did that to other diseases. Tb for example kills an average of 1.5 million people globally a year...if I kept the clock running for TB for 20 months that's 2.5 million dead.</p>
<p>We should have never shut down. UN estimates that 22-138 million are going to starve this year because of the lockdowns and interruptions in the global economy. That's over 5-35x the number that has died from covid. </p>

<p>This whole your gonna kill grandma thing is a joke. If covid was sooooo deadly than why have we caught democrat politicians ignoring thier own lockdown orders?</p>
<p>https://www.businessinsider.com/democratic-politicians-who-violated-covid-19-rules-guidance-list-2020-12</p>
<p>Also if the virus was such a big deal than why were the BLM "protests" permitted to happen for over a year? Media and the medical establishment tried to gaslight us and tell us those "protests" didn't spread covid. </p>

        <p>I'd like to point out that you have yet to respond to my question about why there are more total deaths since the pandemic started than would be expected. This is a factual argument, not one based on emotion.</p>

        <p>It's not deaths per year it's deaths per week. I will link it again. For example look at the week of Jan 3rd-9th. There was 46.3% increase in total deaths vs expected deaths. And your claim is that baby boomers just happened to die that week. Wow, truly groundbreaking explanation, I bet you could publish a paper showing how actually it's just because baby boomers are old and dying. Genius.</p>

<p>But this is beside the point. Even if we use yearly excess deaths it's the same result. There have been a much higher number of deaths since the start of the pandemic than we would expect otherwise. And you have not provided me with an explanation.</p>

        <p>Again you stupid fuck...I already did. Why would I repost something I already posted. This is just a low effort cop out for someone that just can't admit that they got played by government and big pharma. Masks don't work, they never have. Masks do not stop the spread of disease...we have known this for 100 years. Now that it's politically convenient to the covid cult (yes you are in a cult) all that data got thrown out and biased simulations got put in its place.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry but it's clear you didn't actually read the studies you are linking because they do not support what you are saying. Seriously go read them. Besides there are plenty of studies that do support the use of masks that studied the COVID pandemic directly (like this one) https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00818.</p>
<p>Just try, please, to think critically for a little bit and try not to get swept up into such the conspiratorial thinking.</p>

        <p>Health affairs isn't unbiased as the peer review process isn't far from unbiased. The peer review process is a pay to play model that is basically a rubber stamp for leftist political "science".

<p>As for the peer review process, of course it has issues just like any human institution. The problem is that any other source you point to is going to be even more biased and corrupt. Honestly, do you trust what people post on Reddit threads more than doctors and researchers spending their lives working in their field?</p>

        <p>This is just stupid. I sent you 4 articles from sources you trust including the NIH showing you that the peer review process is corrupted and bias </p>
<p>Where your appeal to authority fallacy kicks in is your belief in the process and the experts that have spent thier entire lives in a fields. You act like they can't possibly be wrong because of thier credentials. They can be and almost always are wrong. Scientists are basically bought out by the highest bidder. </p>
<p>You treat Scientists like some infallible priest class in your cult like religion. Remember, if you can't question it, it isn't Science.</p>

        <p>I never said they can't be wrong because of their credentials. My point is that they are way more likely to be right than me or anyone else that hasn't studied it for years. </p>
<p>I think it's good to question science. But we shouldn't blindly question every claim by scientific community.</p>
<p>You claimed I was appealing to authority. To prove me wrong, you then send me 4 articles including the NIH to prove me wrong. Do you see the irony?</p>
<p>The thing is that we all appeal to authority - we have to. The difference is that there are more reliable and credible sources out there. Just because I believe there are problems with the peer review system doesn't mean every paper is biased and journal corrupt (that's called fallacy of division since you seem to like naming fallacies lol). There is nuance here.</p>

        <p>Yes you have, you keep saying you would believe someone from reddit over an expert in the field? That's again your appeal to authority that you think credentials are important. You don't question the science...at all. You haven't shown me you question anything. </p>
<p>Dude this isnt a hard concept...its called using your own gods against you. It's using your trust in these organizations again you. It's pricing your world view wrong with data from the "experts". Your problem is you only believe the experts that affirm your worldview.</p>
<p>There is no nuance. Covid is a joke of a virus and mask mandates don't work. It's simply black and white. The peer review process is flawed and not even close to the best yet your dumb ass worships it like the gold standard of Academia. Remember there have been thousands of scientists over the centuries...the ones that stood out questioned the narrative and "settled science"</p>
<p>You got played and are too stupid and prideful to admit it. Why you won't touch the topic if the BLM riots vs the lockdown protests...its contradictory to your niave worldview.</p>

        <p>I never made a claim about BLM and lockdown protests.</p>
<p>I don't blindly trust experts. I trust them for a reason - they are the most qualified to give recommendations. Why do you trust the dissenters more than the majority opinion?</p>
<p>Again, I can simultaneously believe that there are problems with the peer review process while still holding as being an overall mostly reliable process. For example I might think there are problems with how democracy works, but think that it is on the whole the best form of government. I know it takes more work to form nuanced opinions, but it's not good to look at the world as black and white.</p>

        <p>I didn't address it because I didn't disagree with it. I think you are right about those things. But when you send a wall of copied text I just respond to what I find objectionable. </p>

        <p>You didn't address it because you cant. The "experts" said it didn't and we all know they are wrong. Your "experts" said one did and one disnt...that should show you the experts are not to be blindly trusted. And you do blindly trust them...you have shown me that much. </p>
<p>And the "I can't be bothered to read a wall of text" cop out. Fuck this is like clockwork for you covid cultists. Fucking npc</p>

        <p>Businesses should be able to mandate whatever they want, I only have a problem when the government forces them to to something.</p>
<p>I didn't look it up but I assume restaurant workers have to be vaccinated otherwise it wouldn't make sense to only ask the customers to be.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter though, in Italy teachers have to be vaccinated. That's worse than mandating it for businesses</p>

        <p>The post was about business mandates not government. I believe in the free market. The government saying you can't implement a vaccine mandate for your business would be a government mandate.</p>
