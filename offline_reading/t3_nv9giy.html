    <strong>Revolving door between the pharmaceutical industry and the regulatory agencies</strong>
    <p><p>Emer Cooke, the European Medicines Agency (EMA)'s Executive Director has worked for the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), a lobbying organisation based in Brussels.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.who.int/blueprint/about/emer-cook/en/">https://www.who.int/blueprint/about/emer-cook/en/</a></p>
<p>This revolving door also exists between the FDA and the pharmaceutical industry:</p>
<p>"More than a quarter of the Food and Drug Administration employees who  approved cancer and hematology drugs from 2001 through 2010 left the  agency and now work or consult for pharmaceutical companies" </p>
<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/09/28/495694559/a-look-at-how-the-revolving-door-spins-from-fda-to-industry?t=1623171632351">https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/09/28/495694559/a-look-at-how-the-revolving-door-spins-from-fda-to-industry?t=1623171632351</a></p>
<p>This revolving door can be problematic and can create conflicts of interests. For example, the drug OxyContin, for which Purdue Pharma pled guilty for its role in the opioid epidemic in the US, had its approval overseen by a FDA director who went on to a $400,000 job at Purdue Pharma a year later.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fda-chief-approved-oxycontin-six-figure-gig-at-purdue-pharma-2021-5?r=DE&amp;IR=T">https://www.businessinsider.com/fda-chief-approved-oxycontin-six-figure-gig-at-purdue-pharma-2021-5?r=DE&amp;IR=T</a></p>
<p><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/21/business/purdue-pharma-guilty-plea/index.html">https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/21/business/purdue-pharma-guilty-plea/index.html</a></p>
<p>And now you can contrast this revolving door with this: Frances Oldham Kelsey, who rightly refused to approve thalidomide in the US over concerns about the lack of evidence of the drug's safety, worked for the FDA for 45 years and never worked for the pharmaceutical industry (she previously worked as a faculty member at the University of Chicago and as an editorial associate for the medical journal JAMA).</p>
<p>Personally, I think the revolving door between regulatory agencies and the pharmaceutical industry (and their lobbying efforts) is problematic and should be scrutinized. How can we trust that a regulator will always prioritize the patients' interests and will do everything they can to assess safety, when they could advance their career and count on a higher income in the future by playing nice with the pharmaceutical industry?</p></p>
