    <strong>Gonna start of by saying I’m not an expert at how vaccines are made/work.</strong>
    <p><p>But I’ve worked on large projects before and let me tell you ... when someone says they got something done in a couple months that has ALWAYS taken a couple years ... bruh </p>
<p>It’s like people have never worked on finishing a project in your life. I really don’t think it’s ridiculous at all to be skeptical about something that sounds as absurd as this. I really think this should be the biggest reason people question what is going on.</p>
<p>On the bright side, it seems like the vaccines are gonna roll out to the ones that need it first. My guess is a majority of the people won’t get a chance to get vaccinated until 2022 and onward. So if anything weird does pop up, we’ll def hear it on the news before it’s “our turn”.</p>
<p>An easier way to explain this so that most people will understand:</p>
<p>Apple releases new iwatch.</p>
<p>Fucking awesome but I think I’ll wait for 2nd/3rd gen where they iron out all the kinks from the first wave of people who buy it.</p>
<p>This is why I don’t think the vaccine passport will be too much of a big deal for now cause i believe we’ll be in a state of limbo for about a year where only a minority of the population will have been vaccinated so barring a majority of your customers with corona passports won’t really make sense.</p>
<p>I think I’m rambling at this point so I’ll stop but I love to hear what y’all think the next couple years will look like.</p></p>

        <p>Sure, but a skeptic can counter with - certain diseases take years to manifest, like AIDS, and cancer. </p>
<p>Maybe that sounds extreme, maybe not. </p>
<p>But I think it’s fucking WEIRD that Obama was like “don’t worry Americans, I’ll take the vaccine and show you!”</p>
<p>Like why are they trying so hard to convince everyone to take this shit?</p>

        <p>Turns out the only reason they are approving the vaccine is cause the v3 one will be the one that the elites take and the v0.1 will be the one everyone takes first.</p>
<p>I'm not tryna tinfoil hat vaccines but man as someone who works on projects for a living, the "expedited" vaccine does not sit right for me, no matter what hoops people are jumping through to validate the fast turn-around. </p>
<p>It's leaving the taste in my mouth I get when managers are speaking on behalf of the people doing the work, reporting how we'll get it done by the end of the week.</p>

        <p>I just read something posted here that claimed two doctors (one who was the ex head of respiratory disease at Pfizer) are petitioning to stop these vaccines because they’ve been found to contain a protein that, when attacked by the immune system, cause infertility in women “for an unknown duration”.</p>
<p>Systematically, they are trying to stop us from reproducing.</p>
