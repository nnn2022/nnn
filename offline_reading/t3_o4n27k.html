    <strong>WITF Does Not Wanting A Toxic Experimental Vaccine Shot Have To Do With RACISM?</strong>
    <p><p>I keep seeing this everywhere including MSM, "'Anti-Vaxxers' are 'racist.' I know that the definition of 'racism' was becoming ridiculously expanded, but now not wanting to DIE is racist?</p></p>

        <p>The media makes everything about race. At first they were calling vaxxers racists and claiming that minorities didn’t have enough access to the vaccine. Locally there was uproar when my county got the first doses and CVS in the city with the most elderly people got the most vaccines. Because of course rAcSiM! The media itself is racist and can turn anything into racism. I saw stories about the lack of latino’s getting the vaccine, that they all want it but don’t know how to get it and the story assumed they just don’t have equal access to it instead of going out and ask them. They just assume they are all compliant sheep and because they are racist, they didn’t consider that Latinos are not stupid and can do research, think critically and make informed decisions and that perhaps they don’t want the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Same with the black population. I grew up in a predominantly black neighborhood, and every one of my black friends refuse to take the vaccine, have gathered and partied since the pandemic started, and will never get the vaccine. The only ones with a philosophical argument are, “But Tuskeegee!” Which is a programmed response anyways, and doesn’t prove they actually researched. From my anecdotal evidence, black people just don’t go out to get things like that, unless it is brought to them specifically or mandated, they’ll pass. Not saying it’s right or wrong, just my observation. You can see the same thing with 2020 summer BLM riots, they could have cared less about a mask, virus, or vaccine. The community is focused on other things, and vaccines ain’t one of them.</p>

        <p>This is a very ignorant view of the world. I'm a black person who's explicitly chosen not to get vaccinated for (probably and presumably) the same reasons you are not. I'm young, I'm healthy, I don't need experimental gene therapy coursing through my veins, I want to have children, and I'm suspicious of the massive propaganda that's currently in the public discourse.</p>
<p>Edit: posters on this subreddit should know better than to fall for the typical divide and conquer media propaganda. We are strong united, and weak divided. Don't make this about race, make it about authoritarianism vs liberty.</p>

        <p>I grew up in a ghetto area full of people currently aged 30 that still make mixtapes. Not joking. They aren’t exactly up to date on news and events, and think I waste my life away reading and watching the news for 30 minutes a day. Once again, anecdotal evidence.</p>

        <p>I’m confused by what you’re saying. My statement about black people is only in regards to those I know from the large town I grew up in. Based upon their response to mask wearing, social gatherings, and getting the vaccine. What is your point in commenting?</p>

        <p>"Today, the anti-vaccine empire has hundreds of websites and perhaps 58 million followers on social media. The bad guys are winning"</p>
<p>Aha... so the anti-vaccine empire, which has no direct revenue stream and 58 million followers with hundreds of websites is winning.</p>
<p>While the Vaccine Empire, which makes billions in profit every year (after having spend billions in marketing) and 260 million followers (assuming US only) with hundreds of thousand of websites is loosing.</p>
<p>Despite vaccination willingness* being at an all-time high and anti-vaxx being straight-up censored... what drugs are these guys taking?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>*Fun fact, as a non-native english speaker I googled for "opposite of hesitancy", here are googles recommendations:</p>
<p>recklessness, carelessness, heedlessness, brashness, incaution, incautiousness, unwariness, inattention, mindlessness, negligence...</p>
<p>Imagine I used one of these words instead of willingness.</p>

        <p>It’s a gaslighting technique to make you cave to getting the shot. If you are “othered” and viewed as a racist due to propaganda, then you’ll cave and get the shot due to societal pressure. It doesn’t work on everyone, but stats say a good 75% of people when faced with such get the shot or follow the order. The current argument goes as such; “Covid-19 disproportionately affects the minority community, specifically black people in poor areas, your failure and refusal to take a free shot just around the corner from your house to stop the spread of said disease is proof that you want it to continue to circulate and disproportionately kill black people as it has, because you’re a white nationalist that wants minorities dead.” It’s elementary for sure, but it works.</p>

        <p>It's called argumentum ad hominem.  This is similar to all those scientists remaining quiet because they don't want to be seen as Trump supporters.  People who are undecided about the vaccines will either be pro-vax or remain silent so they aren't seen as radical far-right racists.</p>
<p>The US government did similar crap during the Red Scare.  If you were critical of something the government was doing, then you were a Communist.</p>

        <p>It is a way to silence you and shame you into taking the experimental gene therapy shot. I'm a black man. How could I be racist towards myself if I choose to not take the shot?</p>
<p>I also feel strange about the anti-vax label. I have all my other shots. I just don't want to take a shot that's not been tested yet. It is also difficult to rationalize a recurring vaccine for a disease that kills 1 in 10,000 people under 65. Polio, rubella, tetanus, and other commonly vaccinated against diseases kill a large percentage of people who are afflicted - and the vaccines have been around for decades.</p>

        <p>If people were actually scared of getting covid, why on earth would they think they might get it more from people of Asian decent, for example? The virus isn't racist. The virus is real I had it, I got it while wearing a stupid mask at work with other mask wearers. </p>
<p>Has anyone here, just curious, ever been a witness to that racism? We can only speak from our experiences. I've never witnessed anyone talk about Asians like that in my local Texas area. Nor my friends across the country, nor people here online. </p>
<p>So, with that said, assuming the people claiming to have personally dealt with racists are telling the truth with their experiences. Would it be safe to conclude that the people actually scared of the virus (doomers), would the racists be a subsequent group of the doomers? The ones who are so scared of the virus that they would even be racist about it? So scared that they run out to get the shot? So scared that they would force you to get the shot if you could? Or force you to wear a mask like they do in Canada. Can't even go to the mall without that one guy harassing you (from that earlier video on this sub)</p>
<p>Now please dont misread what I said... I said a subsequent group of the doomers would be racist over the virus, not all of the doomers. Since you would have be a doomer to be that scared of the virus where you want to be racist over it. Or that much of a doomer to want everyone vaccinated and everyone masked up, all out of extreme fear. </p>
<p>And because humans tend to stick to their own social groups, maybe the people who are in the doomer crowd (falling for the propaganda willingly or not) are running into more racists. Birds of a feather flock together, in this case it's figuratively and referring to people's personalities and mindsets. </p>
<p>Again to any trolls out there don't twist my words, you aren't all racists, doomers. I'm saying if you believe the shouting that racism is a big problem for them, to be telling the truth, what crowd would be racists? The crowd like us who wants things normal and not being in fear of this stupid virus, because I know y'all aren't scared of this shit. Or is it more likely to be the group of people so scared of the virus that they want to wear face diapers everywhere (even in the pool or outside) and make everyone get a shot. And the people who will socially shun you and divide society just because you aren't vaccinated? The people so full of hate and malice that they would rather you didn't exist. Which crowd is going to be so scared of the virus that they would also divide racial groups over the virus too?</p>
<p>Meanwhile the people running the world are laughing their asses off trying to have us overreact to the doomers and they're trying to get the doomers to overreact to us. A house divided will not stand. And they want to turn us all against each other. Until, in their dreams, they could swoop in and take control, bringing short-lived comfort to the ones who sided with the government propaganda this whole time.</p>

        <p>When I went to my first protest last year I was obviously aware of the narrative.</p>
<p>Yet, it really surprised me that even friends asked me whether I became racist or why I would protest together with Nazis.</p>
<p>We protest against a health-law-mandate that violates basic-rights. How that makes me a Nazi is so far beyond me, I dont even know how to put it. Especially given that being a german in germany, having to sit through years of education on the matter... Frightening.</p>

        <p>Because antivaxx spaces are very easy for racists to infiltrate, and the overlap between antivaxx thought and racist thought is higher than usual. I've been casually browsing through this sub when I'm bored the last couple of days and I've seen more holocaust denial and racism than I do in my usual reddit browsing. </p>

<p>Define 'racism.' And what are these people saying exactly? Because 'racism' today is just the 'n' word for whites or it means anyone telling the truth about black crime, non-stop massive shootings everyday, all day in major cities. That's not racism, that's speaking the truth, which is exactly what normal people are doing: Speaking the truth about the vaccine, it's untested and dangerous. So it sounds more like people having a problem with the truth and what kind of people are those? People living in a fantasy world or malicious, evil people.</p>

You haven't defined 'racism' nor stated what was 'racist' in any of comments from people not wanting to die from the experimental vaccine. I knew it- you're just one more malicious, evil person. If you don't have the capacity to feel empathy for all of the hundreds of thousands either dead or suffering from this death shot, at least try to have some regard for your own life and health because they ARE eventually going to make the shots mandatory.</p>

<p>Where's your empathy for <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/">these hundreds of thousands dead?</a></p>
<p>Anyway, I know you're doing this in bad faith, but for anyone <em>else</em> who is curious, here are some highlights from their profile.</p>
<p>&rt;Someone BLACK committing CRIME?!? SHOCKING.</p>
<p>~~~~</p>
<p>&rt;Just another infantile way for blacks to make themselves the center of attention because they are incapable getting attention in any productive or constructive way.</p>
<p>~~~~
&rt;Why? The U.S. spends vastly more on welfare programs than any other country in the world. The vast majority of individuals (blacks and Hispanics) committing 95% of the crime in the U.S. are living welfare funded lives and from their perspective they are already living in a Socialist nation, everything for them is already 'free,' free housing, free food, free utilities, free child care, free education - there is no basic necessity that isn't met for them, so that completely decimates the myth that criminals have to 'steal to put on the table,' anyone working in law enforcement will tell you that the vast majority of criminals commit crime for fun and something to do and/or to enrich themselves or simply because of low IQ, low impulse control and has nothing to do with poverty, that's merely an excuse you creepy Leftists use to deflect from actually looking at the horrific reality of black and Hispanic dysfunction and IQ disparities. The only difference is in Finland everyone is contributing and paying into the system while the vast majority of our welfare recipients are not.</p>
<p>Bonus Sexism too</p>
<p>&rt;I just remember how horrific 99% of females are today, made that way by 60 years of feminism, butch, fat, gross, tatted up, STD infested, horrific personalities with zero accountability and boring and stupid as cardboard, I can go on forever- it reminds me of how I wouldn't want to live with or be married to any of them anyway and it makes it 100% better.</p>
<p>So if you're wondering why they don't see anything racist, it's because they are racist</p>
