    <strong>what’s the solution here?</strong>
    <p><p>OK so here in Ontario, we know where this is going. What is the solution, or even short term solution? What should we be doing now to prevent being completely effect from the government? stock up on food? take cash out of the banks? sell our homes or investment properties? hide? I really need a crystal ball! </p>
<p>Anyone have a guess or know something I don’t? I am talking to a lawyer on wednesday to see about a move to texas but would be bringing my two babies with us. it’s all so damn scary!</p>
<p>EDIT: what are YOU doing to feel safer? stocking up food? saving money, etc? How far deep in the rabbit hole do we believe this goes? is this the great reset. LIKE HOLY SHIT GUYS. how is everyone so blasé about what’s happening!!!</p></p>

        <p>It’s really frightening to see that most people in the Canada/Ontario subreddit are championing taking away people’s rights that choose not to get an experimental vaccine. At first I was amused to see how far they would take this thinking it would never happen, but now it’s becoming deadly serious that they want to restrict our rights.</p>

        <p>Lol! I have to laugh at this because I have a close friend who I talk to about this stuff and we were cracking up over the weekend saying OMG listen to us we sound like lunatics! But this world is so crazy it's never been like this before in our lifetime. We are both rehab therapist and we're calling around to other states, we are in New York and it's terrible here. Anyway we're trying to figure out what we have to do to make sure our professional licenses are valid in states were thinking of moving to if we have to. I get where you're at. The fact that you are trying to plan and you're thinking about this is a good thing, your family is lucky to have a leader like you who's looking out for them!</p>

        <p>Boy are you lucky because this is tearing families apart! I've heard it's really bad where you are, I'm in New York and it's bad here but I don't think it's anywhere near as bad as what you're going through and I'm so sorry! I think compared to where you are it's much better in the states. Even our bad states are probably better than where you're at right now, I hope you can figure something out!</p>

I was talking to a long time friend who basically sounded like pure CNN, everything she said was something she heard off the TV it was so frustrating.

        <p>I am so sorry! I completely understand your frustration here it is the Loneliest path we are taking, but we do have one another! I am in New York City and there are a handful of people I know who have not taken it but everyone around me has overwhelmingly just gotten in line and taken it without even asking any questions. I plan to do whatever I have to to stay this way. You Are Not Alone even if it feels like it, there are millions and millions of other people just like you who made this decision, and it is our right to make this decision as to what we put in our bodies! In a normal world if you take a vaccine it protects you it doesn't mean everyone else has to take it for you to be safe!</p>

        <p>I have no clue what to do.</p>
<p>I believe we are in phase II of the takeover, which is the "destabilization" phase.</p>
<p>We are not supposed to know the future.  They want to keep things as vague as possible to disrupt business, relations, plans/routines.  By cutting through the support groups most people turn to for counsel and advice they have really isolated the individual, and left them to fight and think for themselves.</p>
<p>This is by design.  They don't want us to know what to do.</p>
<p>I myself am very confused about what to do.  I've lost my job, my business, and the industry I've worked in for the past 15 years.  I will have to start from scratch.  I have had to incur debt to survive without a paycheck.  I suspect this was all by design.</p>
<p>Because the big question facing you and I is: Where would we go?  I have no clue.  Mexico?  How do we know Mexico won't suddenly turn out like here?</p>
<p>Or, how do we know Canada won't suddenly flip back?  </p>
<p>I keep thinking there will be another lockdown in the Fall, which will be the final final nail in the coffin for many small businesses.  But...  Maybe I'm wrong?</p>
<p>I've sort of said to myself I'm going to wait until the Fall and see where things are at by then.  </p>
<p>Anyway, I don't really feel like we have a choice now anyway.  What are we going to do anyway?</p>
<p>It's very disconcerting, I agree.</p>

        <p>RIGHT!!! We are in the construction industry, so haven’t lost too much (we are incredibly thankful for this). but I just saw a health minister say she wants to make it so the unvaccinated live very uncomfortable lives so that they rethink their decision. There is no way the government would let us continue our business (at least that’s what I think). </p>
<p>They are also saying that businesses get to choose who to service. OK i could go on but as you say, it’s just confusing and unknown!</p>

        <p>Imagine it being the last few months of 2019 and telling people how the next two years would shake out with lockdowns and all the other lunacy and that to “get back to new normal” people would be lining up to get an experimental vaccine. They would have laughed at you.</p>

        <p>To be honest, I am looking into buying property in Central America.  Things are beautiful, safe and cheap in Nicaragua/Panama/Belize etc..  Not that I'm planning on leaving anytime soon, but I want to have the option to get the Hell out.  Food grows down there - all kinds of good organic produce.  People are nice, and not insane.  I've felt a lot better since I've started looking into doing this.  </p>
<p>But yeah, I'm the only one out of all my family/friends up here in Illinois that is concerned and I ask myself if I'm crazy a couple of times a day.  How can others not see it?</p>

        <p>And you think it will forever stay that way? Are you thinking long term? Also, isn't Florida and Texas part of America? Because I know that even though the governors of these states are against the pandemic and mandatory vaccinations they are still humans and we know TPTB have no qualms when it comes to wiping out anyone that stands in the way of their goals.</p>
<p>We are in the New World Order so whatever the world agenda is you can bet your ass it's coming to Florida and Texas too. If you really care about your country stand up and FIGHT!!! Don't fucking run!</p>

        <p>Only in parts of the big cities - really just the same as the US.  I live near Chicago and would never go to some parts at night.  Same deal there.  On a ranking of safest to most unsafe, Nicaragua ranks higher than US.</p>
