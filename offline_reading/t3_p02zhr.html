        <p>Hello,</p>
<p>My name is Matthew and I'm a younger conservative who is a graduate of computer science and a backend engineer for the past 8 or so years. Here today me and my small team of 4 are looking to get feedback from the community on a subject that in our opinion needs to be talked about before it gets any worse. That subject is the state of social media for Conservatives. We have been censored, cancelled and humiliated and those are the reasons that drive us to keep building and to keep getting feedback from the community. We are currently prototyping a few different variations of software that would enable Social Media and Ethereum Blockchain integration and we have the opportunity to build the software in such a way that it gives everybody a little of what they want. Our main priority is security and decentralization. We are enabling users to acquire a native cryptocurrency which will enable tipping, buying and selling. You will also be able to vote with crypto. We want our users to be safe and we want our users to be able to speak freely and have communities without being bothered or cancelled. We're coming to a point in our development that we need to get feedback from the community. We would also like to hear what the community thinks are the implications of a truly open platform. Questions like the following:</p>
<p>What kind of user interface style do you like? ( like Reddit, Twitter etc)
What kind of features do you require (likes, sharing, following etc)
Being integrated with cryptocurrency, do you want to be able to earn rewards for holding our native token?
How open should it be? Should we be cancelling Dems who decide to use our application?
How easy should it be to signup? What kind of verification process we should implement.</p>
<p>We need as much feedback as possible. Any features you think are necessary, any tips, comments or questions please leave below.
Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Signed:</p>
<p>Jennifer (Backend/Blockchain developer)
Gary (Backend developer, marketing director)
Matthew (Blockchain/CrytoCurrency guru)
and last but not least,
Bradley (Frontend developer)</p>

        <p>I got off the stuff years ago personally. This is my last social media thing. And it won't matter when the world is buring anyways.</p>
<p>Edit: oh and definitely don't cancel the left. You need to examine and destroy their ideas. </p>
<p>You destroy darkness by shining a light on things, not by boarding up the windows.</p>

        <p>Just be careful... reddit was supposed to be a place for free speech. Where good ideas and cute puppies get upvoted and the idiocy of communism gets downvoted... look at it now, and look at what happened to the creator (he got epstien'd)</p>
