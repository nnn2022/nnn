    <strong>My experience with Morrisons trying to illegally deny entry to customers without masks</strong>
    <p><p>Morrisons is a shop in the UK where you can get a lanyard that you then wear around your neck to indicate you are exempt from wearing a mask. Yesterday when entering Morrisons a security guard stopped me at the door and asked me if I have an exemption card, I said no. He said he cannot let me in and that as of today a lanyard is not proof enough because anyone can get it.</p>
<p>I responded saying anyone can get an exemption card too (you just print it out from the govt website) and he said you need an exemption written by a doctor as of now. I told him that doesn't exist in this country as doctors are prohibited by law to give out exemption notes to anyone.</p>
<p>His answer was that DOCTORS ARE LYING</p>
<p>I told him he's wrong and he started muttering about only doing what he's told. I went home and filed a complaint letting Morrisons know that not only are they wrong about exemption cards written by a doctor being a thing, but that they are breaking the law by asking for my private medical info.</p>
<p>They replied apologizing and letting me know that I don't even need a lanyard OR an exemption card, all I have to is say that I am exempt and by law I need to be let in the shop. They said they will rectify it straight away and blamed the incident on the security guard being hired through a third party (which is a complete lie as the day before articles came out saying Morrisons will be denying entry to customers without masks, but hey at least they rectified it)</p>
<p>This morning I walked into Morrisons with no mask on and that same security guard gave me an embarrassed look.</p>
<p>So please UK redditors be aware of your rights if a shop tries to deny entry to you!</p></p>

        <p>Good job!</p>
<p>Honestly, if it had to go through doctors, not only would that be (even more) unacceptable discrimination, do they really think that's something we can just get right now? GPs don't want to know even if you're ill... And for more recent onset of conditions where someone might not have access to formal diagnosis at present -PTSD for instance, given mental health services have disappeared- they'd have to go through it with the GP, hope they accept it, and it could be sensitive information they didn't even want to share with their doctor to begin with.</p>

        <p>It's a legal mine field, that's why doctors are just noping out of it entirely. </p>
<p>The government doesn't legally require a doctor's exemption. They doesn't exist, it's not a thing, people need to be clear to those more ignorant than ourselves.</p>

        <p>Firstly this is actually caused by the government, the laws around masks in shops HAVE NOT CHANGED (i.e. lots of exceptions and no need for proof).</p>
<p>What the government has done (Matt Wankcock?) is contact all the major super-markets and tell them that MASKS ARE REQUIRED, NO EXCEPTIONS, ENFORCEMENT NEEDED.</p>
<p>IF you live in the UK it's now YOUR job to educate the poor people who have been told to enforce this illegal thing. It's not their fault (these are just normal people going about their lives), they've been given commands from on high.</p>
<p><strong>Calmly</strong> tell them you're exempt.</p>
<p><strong>Calmly</strong> tell them you are not required to show evidence of this or wear a lanyard or anything of the sort.</p>
<p><strong>Calmly</strong> tell them this is the law, and that them refusing you access on the basis of not wearing a mask they are breaking the:</p>
<p>2010 Equalities act and the 2020 Coronavirus act.</p>
<p><strong>Calmly</strong> tell them here is the government rules on this, and on your mobile phone show:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own</a></p>
<p>Go to section: <strong>When you do not need to wear a face covering</strong></p>
<p>&rt;people who cannot put on, wear or remove a face covering because of a physical or mental illness or impairment, or disability</p>
<p>Go to section: <strong>Exemption cards</strong></p>
<p>&rt;If you have an age, health or disability reason for not wearing a face covering:<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>you do not routinely need to show any written evidence of this</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>you do not need show an exemption card</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;This means that you do not need to seek advice or request a letter from a medical professional about your reason for not wearing a face covering.</p>
<p>Explain that this is the governments own website, and that you're sorry but head office has made a mistake in what they have told you, this is the law.</p>
<p>If they don't budge, ask to see a manager, and educate THEM.</p>
<p>Educate your fellow Brits please.</p>
