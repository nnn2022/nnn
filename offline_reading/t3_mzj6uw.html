    <strong>Doomer Karen at work and an awesome start to my Monday.</strong>
    <p><p>I work at a factory in a somewhat rural area in a swing state. There is a little covid propaganda but not much thankfully, and I‚Äôve overheard chatter from many that most people in this sub would agree with regarding the virus and lockdowns. I‚Äôve had many good talks with my supervisor who is in agreement this is about an agenda rather than a disease. I remember the relief when they offered covid vaccines and said ‚Äúcompletely optional of course‚Äù.  There are still covid freaks here and there. </p>
<p>One in particular is my quality control lady. She has a sign on her office that says ‚Äúour grandparents were asked to go to war, we‚Äôre being asked to stay at home...I think we got this.‚Äù My grandfather was a ww2 vet and I find this preposterous.</p>
<p>When I started working here I went to the temperature reader the first few days and noticed it kept reading my temperature as 89-91 degrees, obviously it‚Äôs broken. So I stopped going to it. </p>
<p>Today I‚Äôm coming into work and walk past the temperature gauge like normal without a second thought. I hear ‚ÄúHEY!‚Äù And turn to see Karen qc standing in front of it with an angry look on her face. ‚ÄúGET YOUR TEMPERATURE CHECKED!‚Äù She yelled angrily while pointing at the device. ‚ÄúWhy are you shouting?‚Äù I ask calmly. ‚ÄúSO YOU CAN HEAR ME LOUD AND CLEAR!‚Äù</p>
<p>I step in front of it. 90.6 degrees. I point at it and say ‚Äúsee it‚Äôs broken‚Äù ‚Äúno it‚Äôs not‚Äù she says as she walks away. </p>
<p>I later asked my supervisor about this woman. He said he had heard about this already because she immediately went and snitched to the supervisors, they had a chuckle and walked off. They have better shit to worry about and don‚Äôt even use the device. </p>
<p>The fact that somebody actually thinks that my temperature could possibly be 90.6 degrees and I‚Äôm not dying in the hospital is beyond ridiculous. These people are so far gone and they are never coming back. At this point it‚Äôs so obvious this is just about compliance.</p>
<p>When I first got hired here I considered it a quick burner job while I figure something else out. I think I‚Äôll stick around. The future is uncertain. Many places are requiring vaccinated employees now. I get paid well and have good benefits and the job is pretty laid back. My job will pay for my schooling to become a welder and pay above industry standards and there is no shortage of work...it‚Äôs a far drive but in a rural area I could buy a house near for cheap in a few years and start farming hopefully before shit hits the fan.</p>
<p>Best of luck everybody. Stay safe and make the right choices on where you‚Äôre going with your life. We can‚Äôt afford any more fuck ups at this point, at least I know I can‚Äôt.</p></p>

        <p>Just sit in an ice bath for 20 minutes. I do it all the time during the winter. Checked my temperature and it would often get that low, no big deal. Of course it's not for very long and as soon as I'm out of the water it begins rapidly rising.</p>

        <p>I love my job. Just about everyone in my department is outspoken against the vaccines. We do follow the mask policy, but even the company allows us to have the mask worn below nose if you are further than 6 feet away from someone. Which is almost always.</p>

        <p>Pro Tip:</p>
<p>The future was uncertain before your government pulled this fascist bullshit last year.</p>
<p>It's always been uncertain.</p>
<p>Keep that positive attitude of taking what you are getting and making it work for you. That is how you overcome uncertain.</p>
