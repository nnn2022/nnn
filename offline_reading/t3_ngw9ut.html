    <strong>145,882,672 People Have Recovered From Covid Worldwide</strong>
    <p><p>Let me reiterate that number down here for an easier comparison with the total death figures I'm about to post below: <strong>145,882,672.</strong></p>
<p>Now deaths worldwide: <strong>3,432,973.</strong></p>
<p>PATHETIC. Absolutely pathetic. You fucking masked idiots have zero perspective when it comes to this shit. We are destroying the economy, ruining people's lives and allowing authoritarian assholes to gain power and wealth for this pussy meme virus, all so you can virtue-signal and feel better about yourselves. Let me do the same for America.</p>
<p>Total recovered: <strong>27,299,180.</strong></p>
<p>Total deaths: <strong>601,949.</strong></p>
<p>You actually think posting that pathetic fucking number makes us quiver with fear and guilt and destroys any sort of argument we make. Fucking laughable. That's not even getting into the FACT that most of those deaths were falsely attributed to Covid, had up to FOUR comorbidities and were people that were likely about to die anyway.</p>
<p>I should also include India seeing as the new scariant is "ravaging" the populace over there.</p>
<p>Total recovered: <strong>22,355,440.</strong></p>
<p>Total deaths: <strong>287,156.</strong></p>
<p>Am I supposed to shit myself reading that figure? India has a population of over ONE BILLION. 25k people die there every day pre Covid. Can you do us all a fucking favor and wake up NOW instead of five years down the line when you're waiting in the bread line with your phone in your hand with the vaccine passport app opened up ready for the QR code scanner?</p></p>

        <p>I've had debates on reddit and irl over this right here. In US alone, we probably have missed millions of cases. People either thinks it's a cold, allergies or they know they have Covid and just wait it out at home.</p>
<p>I am of  a strong belief as well that most everyone in the population at this point has most likely been exposed to the virus. Especially if it really is as contagious as advertised on TV.</p>

        <p>I'm inclined to agree with the majority of the population having it already. I attribute that and vaccine rollout to a lesser extent (TX started showing massive drops at around 15% vaccinated, and we know there's a lot of overlap between vaccinated and people with natural immunity).</p>
<p>There was a report the other day that showed I believe a 96% effectiveness for natural immunity 15 up to 15 months post-infection. It turns out that our body handles covid much like it handles every other strain of coronaviruses that we encounter annually.</p>
<p>On a side note, great username!</p>

        <p>&rt; That series is master class. Ive tried to get a few people into it but GotM is such a deep water dive into the world with no explanation that people get turned off. </p>
<p>Absolutely. It becomes the charm of the series as it goes on. You get the same thing again in Midnight Tides and HoC, but it's very jarring when you just get thrown into the middle of a conflict with this magic system that you've got zero understanding of.</p>
<p>It doesn't help that GOTM is generally one of the "worst" books in the series. It's great, and I love it, but it's very different in scale and tone than even DG right after it.</p>
<p>&rt; Erikson needs to get on that supposed Karsa trilogy ASAP</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely! He's such a great character.</p>

        <p>Dr. John Ioannidis, physician and professor at stanford university did a study of 1000s of people where he asked them if they had covid and also tested them to see if they had leftover antibodies from fighting covid (antigens?). What he found was that almost everybody he tested (90%+) had the antigens from covid, although only 40% of volunteers (of the 1000s) thought they had covid.</p>
<p>In other words, way more people have gotten covid than you think, they were just entirely asymptomatic.</p>

<p>Here is an hour long interview with this doctor, where he talks about his study and many other things.</p>

        <p>That its more infectious than the flu. They said at one point the infection rate was like 1 = 3 subsequent infections. </p>
<p>People have gone on with most of their daily routine for a while now so its just common sense that you've more than likely been exposed.</p>

        <p>There are people who can't get vaccinated because of allergies or other illnesses. Until we reach herd immunity - and we'll get there faster without you crybabies - we'll have to wear a mask where it is required.
Also LOL at the FrEdOm whining. You don't have any clue what it means to not be free. Neither do I.</p>

        <p>How many are there that can't be actually vaccinated? Also isn't it their own right to protect themselves with maybe better masks, not going out if they feel so scared of covid? </p>
<p>I have no idea what it's like to not be free i'm grateful for that but i'm from country that was communist 30 years ago and i have first hand descriptions of that from my parents and grandparents and you nor I would like that and it will come if it continues like this indifinetely. Have you heard about PCR tests being bullshit? <a href="https://off-guardian.org/2020/10/05/pcr-inventor-it-doesnt-tell-you-that-you-are-sick/">https://off-guardian.org/2020/10/05/pcr-inventor-it-doesnt-tell-you-that-you-are-sick/</a> here go take a read. Even the inventor said it's bullshit to use it in this pandemic. <br>
there is a lot one can do when dealing with elderly and people that can't get the jab. </p>
<p>Also do you know that 95% of people that died of covid in US had on avarage 3 co-morbidities which means they would most likely die that year even if they didn't get the covid? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/n92gnx/per_the_cdc_in_only_5_of_the_560616_covid_deaths/">https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/n92gnx/per_the_cdc_in_only_5_of_the_560616_covid_deaths/</a> look, CDC is saying that</p>

        <p>Dumb example, you have nothing to gain from this risk. Ofc nobody sane would do it. </p>
<p>But the virus infects you eventually and if you survive you  will have a trained immune system against it, so yes people die but is it worth to destroy everyone's life over it?</p>
<p>Your logic would be more applicable to the vaccine. If there is a virus with a 2% chance to kill you, will you take an experimental vaccine to not prevent the infection, but just to lessen the symptoms, but have a chance to also kill you (be it less tho). You will still spread the virus to others. But potentially there are unknown consequences in the long term. </p>
<p>There is something to gain but also something to lose. </p>
<p>Given that would you take the vaccine? There are people who do and those who don't. We all make decisions for ourselves. But yet you act like nobody can have authority over their own body.</p>

<p>The usual vaccines are mostly safe, I agree, I also got lots of vaccinations. </p>
<p>But we talk about mRNA technology which is fucking brand new and never has been rolled out before, especially such a large scale. Yes it has been tested in the short term and be admitted for EMERGENCY USE, yes there are deaths in the thousands because of it. No we don't know how it will affect you years down the road.  Could be safe could be not. </p>

You haven't even addressed anything I said, so enjoy your hollow "victory" over one of those evil "anti vaxxers" and their evil agenda to make their own decisions for themselves. That's literally my only point. What happened to my body my choice? If I unlikely die, I die, but I'm advocating for the ability to let people make their own decisions. If the virus is really that bad then the problem does solve itself, don't you think? </p>
<p>And of course you lump me in with all the others because you lack the ability to treat people as individuals. Maybe you should get a mirror and see yourself for the 🤡 that you are.</p>
<p>I always find it funny how you can be so sure of yourself and what you know about the world, when even the science community is reasonably split. And you also seem to be a time traveler because you "know" the long term effects of the various mrna vaccinations. Wow, so honored to meet u. </p>
<p>Just fuck off mind your own business, this does not concern you.</p>

<p>My Dad, the guy who wore a mask and isolated for a year because my Mom has a history of respiratory issues? Military veteran, firefighter, stock car racer. Dude used to run into burning buildings for strangers and you think he's "timid."</p>
<p>I could say the same about myself (military vet) or about the number of other vets, firefighters (including a Marine), and cops that I know who took this seriously instead of acting like dopes, but that might interrupt your paranoia circlejerk.</p>

        <p>Yes... that is exactly what this is. A fake pandemic with rotten PCR tests being used for a purpose they were never intended for, deaths driven up by treatments for CoVid being banned (HCQ+Zinc, Ivermectin, Activated Vit. D, etc.), etc.</p>

<p>Yes..  because the unintended uses have <em>different</em> consequences.  Use PCR where you shouldn't?  You get <strong>false positives</strong> which are disastrous when you're trying to <em>actually address</em> a disease and it's outbreaks.</p>
<p>What happens if you take Ivermectin when you don't need it?  It acts as a prophylaxis and has no negative effect on the user or the reporting of the disease.</p>
<p>See the difference?</p>

        <p>He had been stating for <em>years</em> that the PCR test is a research tool, and is useless for diagnostics.</p>
<p>Then the "pandemic" comes along after he dies, and since he's not around to call out the bullshit, it becomes the "gold standard" of diagnostics. Except <em>even Fauci</em> states that the way they were being used isn't proper.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_Vy6fgaBPE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=260</p>
<p>&rt;<em>“What is now sort of evolving into a bit of a standard, that if you get a cycle threshold of 35 or more, that the chances of it being replication-competent are miniscule. So that if somebody, and you know, we do—we have patients, and it's very frustrating for the patients as well as for the physicians—somebody comes in and they repeat their PCR and it's like 37 cycle threshold, but you never, you almost never can culture [a] virus from a 37 threshold cycle. So I think if somebody does come in with 37, 38, even 36, you gotta say, you know, it's just dead nucleotides. Period.”</em></p>
<p>&rt;-Dr. Anthony Fauci, July, 2020</p>
<p>Funny how once the vaccine rolls out, they drop the cycle threshold to about 28 or so. Suddenly "cases" are dropping. <em>"The vaccine works!"</em></p>
<p>Also from Dr. Fauci, <a href="https://youtu.be/vrAvjU2LBkg"><em>"Asymptomatic transmission has never been the driver of outbreaks."</em></a></p>

        <p>So then would it be fair to say that a positive PCR result does not necessarily indicate the presence of live virus? And therefore a positive PCR result does not necessarily imply that a person is contagious or even infected, rather, it only suggests that some amount of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was present in the sample, especially when the test is performed with a high cycle threshold?</p>

        <p>You're saying 40-ct PCR is used as the <em>primary diagnostic tool</em> when it comes to strep throat?  As a percentage,  how many strep throat tests are done with with this threshold of PCR test <em>only</em>?  Are false positives less likely with strep?  What are the consequences of a false positive with strep?</p>

        <p>Yeah, given how shitty the tests were and how they inflated case numbers, I wouldn't be surprised if the actual number of cases was less than half that. </p>
<p>So it's more like 3 million global deaths and just 60 million cases. Basically a non-issue over the course of a full year.</p>

        <p>Only 5% of deaths were strictly from covid.  The other 95% had an average of 4 co-morbidities.  Add that to the fact any death within 28 days of a positive test gets counted as a covid death.  So yeah, the death number in the US super inflated.</p>

        <p>So you confused a bunch of different things and then jammed them together.</p>
<p>Covid causes chronic conditions to become acute, it also causes many of the other factors that have been listed on death certificates, that doesn’t mean that covid didn’t cause those deaths.</p>
<p>We even have hundreds of thousands of excess deaths here in the US to back the fact that they weren’t just calling everything covid that had the slightest link to covid.</p>
<p>Your 28 days is not US policy, that is something the UK did. The US uses clinical assertions to determine if covid is a cause of death, we don’t nor use arbitrary time guidelines.</p>

        <p>Yet we have hundreds of thousands of excess deaths in the US last year, well beyond any death rate per capita we have had in the past 70 years. It’s clearly not as if they are calling other things CoVID19. We are having our normal deaths, plus hundreds of thousands of additional deaths.</p>

<p>You can look at the death rates for the past 70 years and see that we have never had a rate as high as 2020, that’s an extremely easy to verify touch point.</p>
<p>You have to do the math for 2020 as they haven’t updated 2020 yet but this has all prior years.</p>

        <p>My boyfriend's grandma recently died and she went most of 2020, the last year or so of her life, not seeing her grandchildren and not really leaving the house. In the hospital she was only allowed two visitors at a time - masked up no doubt. I guess it would be too risky to allow someone on their deathbed to be surrounded by their family. Fucking shameful what we're doing to our elders.</p>

        <p>It is so sad. And I feel like everyone conveniently forgets about them, even though this all supposedly started to “save” the elderly. I’m sorry about your boyfriend’s grandma. I lost my grandmother in 2020 also so I understand. She did not die of covid, she’d been battling dementia for years.</p>

        <p>the thing is, that 601k death toll is complete bullshit. health officials have even admitted that dying "because" and "with" Covid is basically the same thing and they are not. case and point, if a 95 year old dies and he tested positive for covid they will literally write it down as a covid death. So when someone brings up that death number, i wanna basically argue with and what i just said, but i always get the "youre seriously thinking these deaths didnt happen?". </p>
<p>The other thing, wasnt the projected number around 10% deathrate? im not sure if that for Worldwide or just the US, but clearly they were WAYYYYYYYYYY off LOL.</p>

        <p>That’s simply not true.</p>
<p>Highest death rate from China was 4%.</p>
<p>A person isn’t a CoVID19 death in the US just because they test positive, yes some mistakes happened early on, but very few people were listed as a CoVID19 death if CoVID19 didn’t actually contribute to their death (yes many of those co morbidities are caused by or worsened by CoVID19).</p>
<p>Excess deaths in the US show that we weren’t just counting typical deaths as covid. Lots of people lost years of their lives to the disease, and it would have been much worse without NPI’s and the military deployments to failed hospitals throughout 2020z</p>

        <p>look at the ages of the people who die (all mostly 80 and above the average expected life expectation). </p>
<p>Also look up deaths in 2017, in 2017 57 million people died. 3 biggest killers were heart disease, cancer I believe and RESPORTATORY ILLNESSES (3-4 million people died of respiratory illnesses in 2017, around the same number as covid killed.</p>
<p>Honestly, if I heard the stats of how many affected worldwide, and how many sick, it seems less a worldwide pandemic and more a very bad flu for mainly the eledery.</p>

        <p>I can’t speak for everyone but I’ve had COVID twice and it’s barely anything to worry about I was sick for 2 and half days the first time and three the second time. If anything it was easier then a normal everyday cold. The worst part of it all was having to miss two weeks of work. I already knew most of this COVID stuff was a bunch of bullshit but actually having COVID really solidified my lack of concerns.</p>

        <p>I think these numbers assume everyone who has it has been tested positive. I know that early in Canada, you were encouraged to stay home and recover if you had symptoms. When I had some of the myriad of symptoms that’s what I did. So if I was positive, they’d never know.</p>

        <p>That we know of. My whole family and I were sick as shit in October/November 2019 and we think we all had it since it was the same symptoms. It was just like a shitty cold. Since then none of us has had more that a runny nose</p>

        <p>You can argue these points a hundred times a day to doomers on here and they insist that those are too high and twist them to look like some high percentage when they are not.</p>
<p>I am not going to dissect all of the numbers around the world but I looked at the deaths where I am in Ontario and also Canada. I found that the numbers did not even remotely look like anything that we should had even closed anything for one day let alone a year and a half.</p>
<p>I also found that if you subtract the excess covid deaths from Ontario and Canada from 2020 and compared what they would had been (without covid) with years prior then the excess deaths from 2020 would had been at historic lows like never before seen in history.</p>
<p>I don't doubt for a minute that the findings would be comparable in many if not most other places but try arguing that to doomers and you might as well be shouting at clouds.</p>

        <p>As bullshit some things are in the pandemic, you cant really downplay the deaths. It’s a lot of people dying. If you look at the big picture, it might not look as bad but there’s times you gotta look at what’s going on outside your backyard. Nothing may be happening in your backyard, but people are dying fast, downplaying death is fucking stupid. How would you feel if someone looked at your grave and said they didn’t care you died because there are billions of people out there?</p>

        <p>Now this is just my personal opinion, and I'm in no way speaking for anyone else here, but if someone looked at my grave and said that, I'd feel fine. Congratulations, they actually thought critically, and understood that death is going to happen. It's unfortunate, maybe even untimely (depending on how old I was), but it's not like I was murdered, or a victim of genocide. I was the victim of a virus, and hey, if I wasn't healthy, and/or I was elderly, then no one should be feeling <em>too</em> bad.</p>

        <p>Around 47-58k American soldiers died in the Vietnam war over the span of 20 years. 291k died during WW2. Between 620,000 and 750,000 soldiers died in the civil war. If you combine the Vietnam War and WW2 casualties, that's a bit more than half of the Covid deaths, and that is a war spanning 23 years. The COVID deaths are awfully close to the civil war casualties. Each of those people was someone's family member, someone's mom, someone's mentor, someone's student, someone's parent, someone's kid. Someone that they grieved and had to accept that they were dead. If that 600k number means nothing to you, I don't know what to say. Try to imagine seeing 600k people lying dead in a field. Try to have a little fucking empathy.</p>

        <p>Any preventable deaths are too many. These were actual human beings who have died. Whole lives ended after spending their last days in pain and suffering in a hospital bed. Many because people don't understand or refuse to try masks and social distancing</p>

        <p>We shouldn't "sacrifice" 2% of the population. But a number of people will die because they will not be able to avoid the virus. And we can't control that. The same way we can't control flu spreading or the common cold or TB. Contrary to what the 2020 "experts" believe, lockdowns DO NOT save lives.</p>

        <p>The hubris of humanity is so apparent in relation to covid. We think that we can control a virus once it’s out and spreading. We can’t. It has to burn itself out. Lockdowns were supposed to give hospitals time to prepare, nothing more. Slow the spread for a bit, not eradicate a virus. How we ended up 15 months later and countries still locked down is a sign of stupidity or malice, or maybe it’s both.</p>

        <p>&rt; deaths thats is avoidable</p>
<p>This is the biggest lie you've ever been told. You can't avoid deaths in a pandemic. No measures can't stop spread from a virus that's AIRBORNE once it appears in one place. </p>
<p>At the beginning, we were told <em>"2 weeks to flatten the curve".</em> Do you understand what that means in politician language? It means <em>"deaths are unavoidable, but we want to spread them over time".</em></p>
<p>Although, yeah, maybe you have a point. Some could have been avoided, considering obesity and lack of vitamin D were overlapping with a big % of the covid deaths.</p>
