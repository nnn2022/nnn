    <strong>Something I noticed with masks</strong>
    <p><p>It looks like I'm still not used to the new normal after 18 months, which is a good thing in a way, but there is something that I noticed and that I wonder if you experienced it, too.</p>
<p>I was at a thrift store thingy today (France has this community called Emmaüs to which people donate their old stuff, whether it be clothes, toys, furniture, and you can find things at only 10 euros that would've costed 120 in "normal shops" and there is nice vintage stuff sometimes), and of course, indoor public space, gotta wear the mask, otherwise cannot enter. I was doing my usual looking through dresses just in case I find something nice, and a lady was doing the same next to me. In my peripheral vision it was just as if she had a full face, but of course, when I turned my head, I saw she was wearing a mask and I felt that despairing feeling. <em>"No, sweetheart, nice try, but nope, it's still the new normal, you just gotta accept it"</em>, it says. And it feels like the inside of my chest sinks into the abyss. I'm kinda exaggerating but that's the closest I can find to describe it. </p>
<p>I have the same with people on the street. For some reason I don't remember them wearing a mask, even if they were. It's like my brain cannot register it. Fortunately not that many still wear one in the outdoors, but still, each time I have that despairing feeling. Mask + sunglasses is super unsettling too. It's hard on the psyche. I can't help but imagine how babies are feeling when they expect to be smiled at in return and are only met with a bluish part covering the lower face... I think next time I go get food and there is a baby in the queue and it looks at me, I'll lower my mask and smile at them, even if I'm more used at keeping a straight face or purposely looking annoyed to ward off potential unwanted attention. </p>
<p>Does that happen for some of you too?</p></p>

        <p>I cannot connect with anyone wearing a mask and I don’t even try anymore. Can’t even talk to my own mother when she’s wearing a mask. I find it offensive and I see the people wearing masks as no-faced blobs. Truly sucks because I love connecting with people. This is highly detrimental to our humanity.</p>

        <p>Early on, I would wear a shapeless black hooded jacket (thick, like a parka), a black balaclava, black face mask and black sunglasses. It made people very uneasy. If anyone ever said anything, I'd say, "Get used to it. We'll be in this for the long haul". They would usually answer, "You're being dramatic. It's JUST FOR TWO WEEKS!" </p>
<p>Me: "No, that's what they say. Mark my words. This is the start of something, and I'll bet this bag of donuts that we'll be wearing masks a year from now."</p>
<p>Mind you, this was February of 2020. That's 18 months ago. Someone owes me some donuts.</p>
