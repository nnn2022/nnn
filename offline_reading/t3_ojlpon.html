    <strong>Shoutout to the march 2020 gang, I know you're out there</strong>
    <p><p>Ninety percent of people wanted lockdown. People begged to be locked up in their homes. I said "this mass hysteria is going to cause more problems than the virus itself" and my coworkers treated me like I was mentally ill. We're the ones who paved the way for the rest to follow.</p>
<p>I would rather die than ever get used to any of this. I spent hundreds of euro's last summer, organizing secret psychedelic parties in the forest.</p>
<p>Social interaction is an inalienable human right. Social interaction is what makes life worth living. From a hug with your friend, to the old man making funny faces for a child waiting in line at the grocery store, to a festival with a thousand people. It's only when you lose everything, that you recognize what is truly important in life.</p>
<p>They can throw me into a Xinjiang concentration camp for the rest of my life for all I care, before I will ever accept the notion that a cabal of pencil-necked epidemiologists are endowed with the right to decide how much social interaction human beings are allowed to engage in. Xi Jinping will burn in hell for all eternity.</p>
<p>I know there are more of you out there and I'd take a bullet for every single one of you.</p></p>

        <p>I have to admit I wasn’t there with you mentally until I actually got covid in December after having the mask on from the beginning. I got it after doing all the random stuff they wanted me to do and I realized the whole thing was a fabrication. I’m with you now though, and I’m trying to convince as many people as I can</p>

        <p>Hell yeah, I've been here since a year (but with two different accounts, because I usually nuke my accounts after 6 months and make a new one). I never bought the shit since the beginning. It was hard at first, but when I finally managed to bring my parents onto my side, it was much easier. <br>
Now I just have stopped caring. Since I've stopped caring if others get the covax, stopped caring about empty labels like "antivax" etc, everything is much better now.</p>

        <p>I've felt this from the very beginning. This has never been proportionate, never been right and even if I assume it's totally about health I still could not agree with such a massive infringement of civil liberties. The best people are the ones who ask me whether I'd still think this way if my clinically vulnerable relatives contracted covid, or if covid mutated into a virus that targetted the young exclusively. I would, because some things are more important than our personal safety.</p>

        <p>The thing was done for me in March, when they wanted to do PCR-mass-testing, but weren’t interested to do a study on antibody prevalence within the population. The more months passed, the more obvious it should’ve been for everyone what kind of hoax this is. If the elites were really afraid of the virus, they would use their money and power to shield themselves from the whole world, but instead they get themselves exempt from all the bs… Great Reset is in full progress and people are cheering it.. The only thing I learned since January 2020 is, how easy people can be manipulated and how they will defend their indoctrination…</p>
