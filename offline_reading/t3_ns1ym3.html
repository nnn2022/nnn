    <strong>Either The Vaccine Works Or It Doesn't: Which Is It?</strong>
    <p><p>It's crystal clear to me that most of the people rushing out to get the jab DO NOT understand the science behind it. They literally have no fucking clue whether the damn thing works or not. They blindly "trust the Science" without even knowing what the fucking "science" <em>is</em>! When they say "trust the Science", what they <em>really</em> mean is "trust the media". You can preach at me about how "euphoric" you felt after the jab and how the overall experience was "orgasmic" as much as you like, I still won't get the fucking shot. Deal with it, bitch.</p>
<p>If you have had the vaccine, you are protected. That should be the fucking end of it. My vaccination status shouldn't even concern you. The amount of people that CAN'T get the vaccine but truly need it can fit inside a thimble and are probably on death's door anyway. Your lack of confidence in the vaccine's effectiveness does not inspire a great deal of trust in me, either. Truth of the matter is you're mentally ill if you're still fretting about the virus post-vaccine, and you should probably look into therapy or getting yourself sectioned.</p>
<p>That's doomers, though. The government and media is a different kettle of fish. The UK government and media keep fear-mongering about "new variants" and the start of a "third wave" and how this will lead to a delay in the restrictions being lifted on the 21st of this month. Right, okay, so the vaccines are fucking useless then are they? No? Then why the fucking panic? Everyone who needs the shot has had it now so the hospitilizations and deaths should remain low. If they don't, well, that suggests the vaccine <em>is</em> in fact WORTHLESS and my getting it would be utterly pointless.</p>
<p>They want everyone to get jabbed up yet keep the restrictions in place indefinitely, rendering its intended purpose and all the effort to "combat the virus" this past year entirely moot. You can't have your cock and eat it, too, you fucking power-hungry, psychopathic pricks. Either the vaccine works and you open back up, or it doesn't and you can stop telling me to fucking get it and sending me letters even though I've cancelled my appointment already. Fuckers.</p></p>

        <p>The vaxxes are utter shit, no immunity, no stopping of transmission. Hell if they were like regular vaccines, us "dirty" "no good" unvaccinated would be safe to be in a group of vaxxed people [well outside the possible shedding proteins] because they could not get it from us and vice versa! With the boosters too, when do the vaxxed know their vaxx "ran out". No one knows. Assholes! They destroyed our lives.</p>

        <p>In fairness, they'd have better luck with getting the vaccine than therapy, I tried to reschedule just a psychiatrist check-up and was told 'too bad, no more till September'. Got my vaccine letter to ignore alright, though. Can't get through to the GP, either. Yay NHS priorities.</p>

        <p>I do have a legitimate question about vaccine efficacy. There are lots of people out there who defend the new vaccines by saying that "no vaccine is 100% effective."</p>
<p>Ok, but we have been able to eradicate measles and smallpox through vaccinations. In the West, tuberculosis is also no longer vaccinated against because it has been defeated thanks to vaccines. If this is the case then what effectiveness do those vaccines have?</p>

        <p>As someone who is also not getting the vaccine, stop being so black and white, it makes you sound ignorant. The vaccine “works” to some degree. No vaccine is 100% effective. Vaccines do “work” better the more members in a population get it because it lowers overall risk of spread to the population. The argument that “if your vaccine works why do I need to take it?” is stupid and shows a basic lack of understanding as to how vaccines work.</p>
<p>The question you should be asking is if it is necessary and worth the risk of unknown side effects to YOU. Are you personally enough at risk of COVID19 at your age and health status to risk taking a vaccine where there is no long term study data? </p>
<p>Choosing not to take the vaccine is making a choice to put your health above the herd’s, by not accepting unknown risks when your risk from COVID is so low. I personally do not see anything wrong with that decision. Let’s own it.</p>
<p>I see COVID as a very overblown media created pandemic. Do people die from it? Absolutely. But I see nothing wrong with choosing not to take a vaccine to prevent a virus where the majority of people who die from it have multiple comorbidities or are past the normal lifespan for a human. If I were 65 years old I would take the vaccine to protect myself. If this virus were killing young, healthy people I would also take the vaccine. It’s all about choosing the risk for yourself.</p>
<p>I saw recently a vaccine is coming out for diabetes. To me this would also be a case where it would be worth unknown risk to take that vaccine. Diabetes is a life impacting and devastating disease to live with. For most people, COVID19 is not.</p>

<p>I do agree, but this isn't entirely accurate of how these situations transpire.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>Take your vaccine to protect everyone.</p>
<p>"I have prior infection immunity."</p>
<p>"No, that doesn't last, you still need a vaccine to protect me."</p>
<p>It's the same bullshit logic with masks. "I wear a mask to protect you." LOL!</p>
<p>Now it's been translated over to vaccines. "Get a vaccine to protect everyone else."</p>
<p>Yet somehow, this has not once been the historic narrative.</p>

        <p>Hard not to be black and white when the opposition is making everything black and white, but I agree with the majority of what you said. Thing is in the UK it seems like the majority of the population has had the vaccine yet the government and media are still saying that's not enough and that restrictions have to stay.</p>

        <p>I posted this earlier but I'll post it here too: </p>
<p>Vaccines are never 100% effective at preventing illness, like any medicine, diagnostic tool etc is not 100% effective at curing or diagnosing a disease, combined with the fact that new variants may pop up that affect / increase the contagiousness of the strain this means that you can get sick while having been vaccinated. And so your title gives away the misunderstanding, it's not a categorical 'yes or no', it's a continuum of effectiveness. </p>
<p>So yes, vaccines that are by their nature not 100% effective may lose even more potency when there are environmental factors such as new strains or there is frequent exposure, if the odds of getting sick is hypothetically 1% after exposure after the vaccine then frequent exposure is still risky, it's just a matter of probability. Again, it does work but it's effectiveness is variable. We try to control those variables further with more vaccinations, social distancing, masks and so on. </p>

        <p>Very interesting, thank you. It indeed explains the strokes that especially youths had been having.</p>
<p>A few points to note, the authors still speak or a virus. I don't see why you're talking about 'presupposing the existence of a virus'. Also spike proteins being responsible for some/all symptoms doesn't refute anything, so I'd like to see how you think about that. If the spike protein issue causes the symptoms but it's the result of the virus then why see them as separate things?After all, it's still a contagious virus - as the authors say - and in that case injecting yourself with a vaccine that makes you a toxin factory will still help prevent yourself from getting sick and spreading to other people.</p>

        <p>If by 'failure' you mean getting ill while having received the vaccine then it seems you're very well aware that indeed with effectiveness ratings of above 90% it is 'rare' that somebody gets a disease (read: the chances are low).</p>
<p>What is important here with covid keep in mind that again environmental factors influence these odds: different strains, frequent exposure, inappropriate distancing and so on. In turn, making it less 'rare' that vaccinated people get sick anyway. Just a matter of probability, as I just explained. Clearer now?</p>

        <p>Look, you can't sell this one to me, I am in my 50s and remember how vaccines have worked for decades before these miserable excuses for them popped up. The vaxx is a failure and doesn't work. It's not opening up society. So yeah the failure rate is high enough on that 5-10 percent level rendering the vaxx basically ineffective for what it needed to do. People are hedging their bets. I know someone who was fully vaccinated and got Covid pneumonia and was hospitalized. I think they were "designed" to "fail", keep society locked down forever.</p>

        <p>I am not selling you anything, I am explaining that we know, via the scientific method, that instruments such as vaccines are never 100% effective. You yourself know that is true since you're aware of instances where vaccinated people have gotten sick in the past, albeit in rare situations. Since you know that vaccines are not 100% effective but somewhat below that, you will also logically understand that when the effectiveness rating is progressively lower that vaccinated people have a progressively higher chance of getting sick. Now, knowing that e.g astrazeneca has 63% effectiveness and Moderna 86%, you can logically see that this leaves a gap where people with a vaccine can still get sick. Moreover, as I mentioned, environmental factors such as frequency of exposure (if more people are sick), new strains, more contagious strains etc can in turn make this virus last much longer. What the vaccines help achieve is to simply lower the odds that each individual can get the disease, which slowly lowers the numbers, but does never guarantee that a single individual will not get it. I hope this explanation helped.</p>

        <p>Honestly what's the use if you have a 20-30 percent chance of getting it anyway? Seriously. All it takes is the roulette wheel spinning, you meet that next person or persons. I think some linear thinkers who can't see the forest for the trees have majorly screwed up. I always thought science was going down some wrong roads. Just the fact that these type of vaxx messing with the immune system and DNA were seen as a good idea means you mad scientists are now directly destroying our lives, and they don't even truly work. I walked around as a kid, not worried about the 20 percent chance of catching polio. </p>

        <p>Our current culture surrounding risk and fear is an entirely different matter and existed separately from COVID. But you talking as if it's a worthless effort to reduce the odds of getting a disease is of course ridiculous, you might as well stop washing your hands, cooking your food and visiting the doctor when feeling unwell. Reducing the odds of getting sick is, for most, a worthwhile endeavour and of course a possibility due to science. That of course does not preclude one from making their own choices. However, when that choice can significantly cause harm to others in society it may become a collective issue with different parameters. If your choice can lead to the death of another then it should not surprise anybody that we're entering different ethical realm - the one we're in currently. </p>
<p>Scientists are trying to figure out the best ways to make sure that roullete ball ends on a spot that kills fewest possible people. That doesn't mean they will always immediately pick the best options because public policy is not a scientific domain. But I would rather live in a time and place where we use this knowledge to prevent illness than live in chaos, such as during the black plague, and see millions die. Evidence based policy does truly work, but with degrees of effectiveness. Believing that this situation could have panned out in a way that would have satisfied everybody is so incredibly naive, unless you believe that an evidence-based approach to policy here was the wrong way to go I think it's important to come to terms with the uncertainty and imperfection of the situation.</p>

        <p>You make no sense. Covid isn't even a problem for the majority. Why are they putting children and young adults at risk with a risky vaxx, when they are little or not risk from Covid? That alone destroys your whole argument.  Also if the Covid vaccine is imparting the same harmful spike proteins that affect the body negatively as Covid, why do you support it. Why do you ignore such things and why don't you think them out. So don't talk to me about death or fear of it, or pretending to give a damn. Monsters like you don't even care about those who are high risk from your glorified shots of poison that don't even fully protect anyone. Why else are there no medical exemptions? The chaos is coming when the mRNA die-offs begin. You all overshot, and your experiment is going to be humanity's biggest nightmare.</p>

        <p>COVID isnt a problem for the majority, excuse me? Have you seen the age distribution of the world, especially in the west? In fact, it is primarily your generation and your parents who we are protecting by undergoing these policies and measures, I can't believe I have to tell you that. Additionally we know that younger adults also can suffer severe long-term effects from COVID infection. </p>
<p>Why would somebody support vaccination? To prevent illness and harm to others and prevent (further) harm to yourself. Why is this something I have to explain to you? Don't pose rhetoric questions. </p>
<p>If we would be monsters then we'd be going on our merry way as youths and let people like you and my parents die off COVID while the medical institutes internationally are paralyzed with patients. We are exactly NOT monsters by undergoing this and having our lives turned upside down to protect lives of people like you. Your brain is a disaster, what are you even saying.</p>

        <p>Young people should not have their lives sacrificed for the old. Yes I am one of the high risk people and I think it is INSANE that young people are being given an experimental vaxx, when they are in little to NO danger from Covid itself. That makes no sense. You don't put young people at risk. It used to be that the old provided for the young and put them first. The cases of Covid in the young are very rare, and well just read this board, look at all the cases of vaxx injury in the young, the cases of myocarditis etc. Don't you realize how bad things are getting. </p>
<p>Also I support vaccination, I've taken all the other vaccines but these vaxx, they are harmful, they have too many risks. I would go and line up for a Covid vaccine tomorrow if I thought it was safe, didn't hijack my immune system and these aren't. You think it's easy being a disabled high risk person that I am in between damned if you do and damned if you don't. I don't want any young people losing their lives because of me.</p>

        <p>Yes, if you Google the interview there are multiple fact-checker websites that debunk that article. </p>

        <p>There are fact checkers for everything that's against the govt narrative unfortunately. Like how they did it last year when he said the virus came from a lab In China. And yet look at where that stands now.</p>
<p>He's a legitimAte virology scientist. I'd hate it if he were right about this. But I think he won't be saying something like this if he wasn't convinced if it was true.</p>

        <p>I am not in the position to refute or argue with a professor in a specific field, that would be plain foolish. This is a weigh off between pros and cons, and trying to quash this pandemic as soon as possible is of course #1, so some risks are justified.</p>

        <p>Isn't the key issue around effectiveness older people with weak immune systems, as with the flu vaccine, which most people were not expected to have? They'd remain at risk from viruses, if they're very frail, even with a fully vaccinated population.</p>

        <p>Effectiveness of a vaccine relates to the strength that a vaccine can prevent infection. It is, as far as I am aware, unrelated to the severity of symptoms - which is something we see in practice right: some with vaccines still get very sick. I am unsure to what degree people's immune systems are involved in preventing infection, would love to read any information about that if you have any.</p>

        <p>All vaccines are doing is priming the person's own immune system (eg. by presenting covid's spike protein for it to have a looksie at) to deal with the virus, should they encounter it in the wild. So, how well/fast their immune system can respond should affect odds of infection and severity (can it 'fight off' covid before it makes it into too many of their cells and replicates?). It also means it's not random who becomes very ill despite being vaccinated - and indeed, that many of those who do were <em>already</em> very frail and vulnerable, with failing immune systems. As in, if the whole population is vaccinated against covid, another virus could easily still kill them.</p>

<p>Vaccine development went better than hoped but this discusses age as key factor. The Moderna vaccine is 86.4℅ effective for people 65+, but 94.1℅ effective overall.</p>
