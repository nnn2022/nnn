    <strong>What is the best way to counter the issue of mutations in the context of lockdowns and the case against them?</strong>
    <p><p>The issues around mutations are that the ability of them to make the vaccines ineffective means that there is a need to lockdown and conceivably having lockdowns as part of our life for all of 2021 and maybe most of 2022 because if not, the virus will infect enough of the population to mutate into a supervirus.  One that's as dangerous as the current variants, more infectious and wholly able to get around our immune system.  And so therefore we can't have open societies because it means more opportunities for mutations.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>How does this line of thinking with regards to mutations and lockdowns get countered?  I was wondering if there is scientific evidence that's being overlooked, with regards to how mutations are caused and if fast spread is what causes it, or on lockdowns relative to mutation rate.  I know that crowded hospitals are a key factor, as they were in the Spanish Flu when soldiers too sick to fight in trenches would crowd them and lead to a wave that was unqiuely dangerous for the 25-35 age range.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Other than that, what evidence is there to counter the argument that mutations are leading us to need lockdowns as a permanent way of life?  And how in general can this argument be countered?</p></p>

        <p>There are more than 4,000 mutations of coronavirus in the UK alone (<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55413666">https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55413666</a>), and this is not abnormal - not for pandemics (which characteristically mutate to become more virulant and less dangerous as time goes on) or for this particular virus, SARS-CoV-2, which is a relatively stable virus even among the coronavirus family (<a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/relatively-stable-sars-cov-2-genome-is-good-news-for-a-vaccine-67319">https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/relatively-stable-sars-cov-2-genome-is-good-news-for-a-vaccine-67319</a>). The current trends of mutations to stabilise the spike protein were already going strong in March last year (<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.991844v1">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.15.991844v1</a>). It's neither a novelty nor a separate, unforeseen crisis. Anyone who says it is and prescribes unprecedented solutions has taken leave of the science and is speaking politically (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0690-4">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0690-4</a>).</p>
