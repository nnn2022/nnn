    <strong>Looking for non vaccinated people near me, Albany New York.</strong>
    <p><p>I am the only person that I know that has not gotten the vaccine, my entire family has gotten it, all of my friends have gotten it, as of yet I’m not pressured by my friends however my family specifically one member has been pressuring me into getting it and despite my repetition of telling them I would like to wait till it’s mandatory and then I will give it strong consideration, the pressure from family has only gotten more intense. Looking for advice on how to politely tell them no, would greatly appreciate making friends that haven’t gotten it in the likely event that my peers and relatives that are vaccinated start to apply more pressure and I would like to have a safety nap because I do not plan on caving into the pressure anytime soon.</p></p>
