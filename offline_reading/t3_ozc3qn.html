    <strong>Has this changed anyones thoughts or beliefs regarding Masonry or " Satanic International Banking Cabals"?</strong>
    <p><p>Im hoping this doesnt get deleted or I dont get jumped on, because I am genuinely asking.  I know it sounds insane, but look at the course weve navigated over the last 6 or so years.  What</p>
<p>I had heard the whole NWO/Mason theory for years, but never bought into it or really looked at it.  I figured it was mostly hyperbolic.  Never even looked into any of the wikileak email stuff.  I have friends who are Masons, and they said its all bullshit, so i never really questioned it.</p>
<p>But about 7 months ago, I got into the memestock thing and became an "ape".  Weve all spent the last 7 months seeing the blatant manipulation and conflict of interest that exists in our financial markets and media.  I think that opened a lot of peoples eyes. By synchronity, I was thinking about what would actually "unite" those people, whats the ultimate motive and where does loyalty truly lie?  Then I came across this sketchy 5hr video that I had to force myself to watch, because I normally wouldnt give it a chabce.  But i felt compelled to give it a sincere chance, and by the end I was conpletely sold.  I ended up looking at the wikileaks emails from a few years back, and that really disturbed me as well.  How could noone investigate that shit?  How could the media seriously try to downplay those emails? If i remember correctly, werent they basically trying to shift attention to the fact they were "hacked", rather than their contents. There is just way to much "coincidence" and evidence for it to not be seriously considered, imo.  And the actions our "leaders" are taking now doesnt help matters.</p>
<p>I had already known about things like Event 201, but didnt really think that kind of corruption was so pervasive in our world (silly me). Now I am wrestling with myself intellectually, because I have seen enough evidence to satisfy me, but I still find myself feeling like its all still too over the top to be reality.  It would require us to examine our entire lives narratives.  But i also feel in my gut that yeah, that explains things.  Occams Razor says "entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity", and all the pieces seem to fit and account for one another.  Hanlons Razor says to not attribute malice to something that can just as easily be ignorance, but I think were far beyond ignorance or stupidity being the excuse.</p>
<p>Am I alone here?  Does it not seem or feel like there is something far bigger at play here?  And if any of that is accurate, what do we do?  It seems they are able to perpetuate this shit because they know most of us wont believe it, or wont be willing to make the changes in our lives to actually do something about it.</p>
<p>Thoughts (other than Im batshit crazy?)</p>
<p>(EDIT - flaired this way because im not trying to make an absolute statement, because i dont know what the exact truth is, and i think the only "proof" many would accept is a flat out admission by TPTB, and probably not even then.)</p></p>

        <p>Im already in that one too.  Ive always enjoyed learning about them, because it made me have to learn about a lot of other things as well.  But I honestly think this is the first time where I'm really feeling like its tangible, modern, and right in front of us.  The fact that we don't seem to notice is just amazing to me.  Because it really is right there.</p>

        <p>The "satanism" aspect i think just comes from the whole "lucifer" worship, from what I have seen.  They dont actually think its a negative entity, but a liberating one.  From what I have gathered, it seems more divided up between groups regarding service to self (them) and service to others as a life perspective.  And its all very convoluted and muddied.</p>
<p>The biggest argument that ive seen for it essentially lies in whats written in the masonic books, and the fact that many celebrities and politicians, now and historically, have been active in their lodges.</p>
<p>Theres the whole "belief" aspect, and many people cant believe any of the shit in those books is possible, but i guess it also doesnt matter if <em>we</em> believe it, because <em>they</em> believe it.  But they are definitely focused on themselves.</p>

<p>Bad quality.  Guy goes religious at some points, and it feels like it takes forever, but he really does show a ton of photographic and video evidence of all those people being masons or repeatedly using their symbols, and pulls everything he is saying from the books of manly p hall, albert pike, and blavatsky.</p>
<p>Its definitely something people would likely outright disregard, but if you actually watch it, he backs up what hes saying .</p>

        <p>The ability to be corrupted isnt complicated.  The web of deception and symbolism they use to keep us distracted and unaware while they set their own plans in motion and stick to the "rules" is complicated to explain to the average person though.  I guess I really wouldn't even say its complicated.. its unimaginable and likely to garner eyerolls.  But it all seems to be there in text.</p>
