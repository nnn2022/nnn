<title>Wearing a mask isn't about keeping you safe. It's about dehumanizing you and your fellow human being. It's psychological warfare on your mind. It's about submission, obedience, on the first step in giving away your sovereignty.</title>

    <strong>Wearing a mask isn't about keeping you safe. It's about dehumanizing you and your fellow human being. It's psychological warfare on your mind. It's about submission, obedience, on the first step in giving away your sovereignty.</strong>
    <p><p>Everyone being forced to wear face mask is conditioning people to think and believe that we are living in a pandemic. The constant news cycle of a fear porn 24/7 is essentially psychological warfare on your mind. It's predictive programming, telling you that the world is not a safe place and that you should be afraid. And the vast majority of people have gobbled it up. </p>
<p>What happens when you're afraid? When you're living in fear.. you're easily controlled and manipulated. This is how hotelitarian government comes in. The vast majority of the population is afraid, so they present a solution... Wear this mask, lockdown businesses, restrict the flow citizens, give up these rights, in order to feel safe.</p>
<p>The first submission is wearing a mask that actually does nothing to stop transmission. Next step is to vilify anyone who doesn't support the narrative of wearing a face mask. Your various NPC arguments are, <em>keep Grandma safe, you're doing this for others not you, you're selfish if you don't</em> these one-liner arguments are all publicly shaming you into submission.</p>
<p>The lockdowns are extremely harmful and have really no benefit at all, other than destroying our lives and the way we live. Especially destroying the middle class which is independent business owners, the real life blood in the economy and pillar in any community. For all the haters out there, cuz I know there's going to be a lot check out the articles below.</p>
<p>This is an excellent source full of research showing the ineffectiveness of masks from places like the CDC, Oxford, universities and medical journals </p>
