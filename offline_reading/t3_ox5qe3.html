    <strong>The madness of crowds</strong>
    <p><p>This pandemic is a state of mind. The disease is real, but the pandemic is fake. </p>
<p>Meaning that it's a social construct whereby people have agreed to go mad together out of fear. And so we have rampant alarmism at every uptick in cases, magical thinking (masking in the car keeps you safe!), curated ignorance by the MSM, ritual self-flagellation (lockdowns - the harder the better), religious ritual (vaccination as a sacrament - even if you're super low risk you need the jab to be in a state of grace), demonization of the noncompliant, and a new class of the ceremonially unclean (dirty anti-vaxers!). It all adds up to a society in an auto-immune reaction against itself and few dare speak against it.</p>
<p>Charles MacKay said it well:</p>
<p>"Men, it has been well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, one by one.‚Äù </p>
<p>Thankfully this sub exists for people to come to one by one to regain their sanity.</p></p>

        <p>The media is working overtime to keep the hysteria going. People make irrational decisions when they are in a panic.</p>

        <p>The intelligence agencies, the ad industry,  as well as others have spent a lot of money studying how to manipulate people. They know that people who are afraid act first and think later. All an average person understands about Covid is what they get from the govt. approved sources because they believe that this is the most accurate info available. They don't have any reason to question the govt. All they want to do is to be left in peace to live their lives not understanding that what they want and the people that rule them are completely incompatible.</p>

        <p>Yes! Anyone who wants to understand that this isn't the end of the world, but is an instance of mass hysteria and needs some historical perspective needs to read Mackay's book.</p>
