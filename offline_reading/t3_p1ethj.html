    <strong>Just a small rant after a rough couple of days...</strong>
    <p><p>This is insane. I am just flabbergasted on a daily basis that this is the world we live in. People who I thought were rational, intelligent, worldly and compassionate people are sharing dumb anti-mask memes and virtue signaling up the wazoo and it's just so disheartening. I'm feeling resentment toward the friends I do talk to for not wanting to talk about it all, for not being angry, I guess. They just want to go back to "normal" and forget about how fucked this has all been and continues to be. I am so grateful for my family's sanity and this sub, keep on keeping on folks.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, what really shocked me is I know a lot of people through the way I was raised, which was mostly outside of societal norms, and watching those people just blatantly shaming people who won't get the jab breaks my heart.</p>

        <p>Don’t be fooled by the narrative though.  There are a TON of people that have our frame of mind, they just aren’t getting media coverage.  </p>
<p>Then there’s also a ton of people that were on the fence about the vaccine and I highly doubt they will commit to this 6-12 month regular booster.</p>
<p>Things could go south but there is a lot of resistance.  They just want to share in the media that “everyone is doing it” so you feel isolated and will eventually cave but for a lot of us they are learning that they are just reinforcing our resilience.</p>

        <p>Every now and then I am astounded and appalled by the low quality of the bulk, dead-weight of humanity. The 2016 election was one of those times, but there have been many others. It's come to my mind that this event while much larger in scale is not unlike the many other controversial or staged events that occur periodically and stigmatize the populace. Each one entails censorship, demonization of those who don't follow the official narrative, and the basic guardians of the status quo who vehemently follow suit. They also each entail an army of shills and useful idiots who are tasked with harassing any and all who disagree, so as to pressure them into silence or cooperation through ostracism. The fooked up thing about this case is that people are now being coerced or outright forced to partake in the narrative.  Seeing the lemming cheerleaders call for authoritarian mandates and spew such disgusting vitriol is disheartening, and disqualifies them of any respect.</p>

        <p>I have had a rough day too. I’ve felt a bit of hopelessness today. Just a week ago I went to the store and no one had a mask on, I go into the store now and everyone has one on. My day job is now requiring masks to walk from my desk to the bathroom and to the break room. I am going to keep low at work for now and simply scrimp and save for the inevitable vaccine mandate coming.</p>
<p>Every bit of logic and science tells us that none of this shit works. That mask on my face to walk to the bathroom does nothing. However, people are buying it again. </p>
<p>It is clear that the vaccine does not work. It is clear the vaccine is causing the variants. It is fairly clear to me the vaccines will have side-effects not seen yet. However, it is also clear to me that people are willing to tolerate a lot more than I would have expected. It is amazing how much people are willing to sacrifice for a tiny bit of comfort.</p>
<p>It feels like  it will take much much more to get Americans mobilized.</p>
