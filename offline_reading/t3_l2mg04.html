    <strong>What ever happened to ‚Äúdon‚Äôt believe everything you read on the internet‚Äù</strong>
    <p><p>I would hear this all the time before ‚Äòrona became mainstream. ‚ÄúWhere did you get your facts? Facebook? Thats not a reliable source of information‚Äù, is something my professors often stated while taking college courses. </p>
<p>Suddenly, we find ourselves in a world of ‚Äúfact checking‚Äù and virtue signaling with pictures of chicks holding up their new vaccine passports #WearYourFuckingFaceDiapers üçÜüçëü•∫</p>
<p>We went from a society that, rightfully so, was cautious of what we saw online to a society that took it all at face value. Whatever happened to intellectual honesty or humility? Is it anonymity that fuels this retardation? </p>
<p>Im sick of seeing and hearing people try to seem morally superior for taking a vaccine that, for all we know, could make them infertile or worse in the long term. Im sick of being told that I am a sociopath for not wanting to cover my perfectly healthy face with a diaper. </p>
<p>When this all ends, and I think it will, there had better be a reckoning for people like this.</p></p>

        <p>This whole thing reeks of intentional social manipulation. </p>
<p>"All politicians are liars and scum" became "Trust the politicians (but only the ones we like)!"</p>
<p>"Don't listen to things you read on the internet" became "Everything you read is true cause it was on reddit!"</p>
<p>"Don't watch TV, the media just pushes fear porn" became "Listen to the talking heads or die!" (This one is my personal favorite).</p>
<p>"Doctors don't know everything" became "Listen to the experts no matter what!"</p>
<p>And the idea of being rewarded for questioning things logically turned into "shut up and obey" real quick..</p>

<p>This is very true. The amount of times I've seen deliberate disinformation the past year on r/news or r/worldnews which all hit the mainpage is simply astonishing. And gullible people gleefully fall for it.</p>

        <p>You ever hear about the logical fallacy, "argument from authority" or "appeal to authority?" There's a reason it exists. Just because somebody is an expert doesn't make them automatically correct. That's not even taking into account that the media loves parading around experts in a field that might have nothing to do with what is being discussed. </p>
<p>How many doctors out there would give you incorrect or biased advice? There's a reason that second and third opinions are common in medicine, and that's exactly why. How many stories are there about people getting misdiagnosed multiple times? Because doctors are human, so are experts, and we all make mistakes. And that's why it helps to be skeptical.</p>

        <p>Absolutely. And that‚Äôs why each INDIVIDUAL, should be talking with their own doctor who knows them. Because it‚Äôs not an all sim game. It‚Äôs also why people have heard a diagnosis and it (up to a year ago) was completely common practice to seek a second, third, fourth etc opinion on YOUR health. This idea that everyone is in ‚Äúlockstep‚Äù with this situation as a whole should be enough for rational people to at least raise an eyebrow. </p>
<p>The fact that that isn‚Äôt happening, isn‚Äôt being discussed, nor being allowed to be discussed is legitimately insane.</p>

        <p>Nobody has not mentioned not listening to experts? We did mention being cautious with information overall, however. Someone else mentioned how people used to say that doctors don‚Äôt know everything. That sentiment rings true even still. I know and have known plenty of doctors who are so incompetent its frightening. The media and social media would have you think that anyone with a degree in a subject is the end all be all for that subject. I can think of plenty of people in my life with 20+ years experience and graduate degrees that STILL dont know everything about their field. Being an expert only goes so far</p>

        <p>The truth is that the doomers think we are those kind of people. They think of us as Facebook experts.</p>
<p>That's why they always go "source???" expecting news and facts that would be big Big international scandals to be present on CNN.</p>
<p>They don't think of independent media as valuable source, even if Mr. PhD-works-in-a-lab wrote the article.</p>
<p>But expect CNN to admit "hey we've been wrong the whole time haha this was all a military tactic to subjugate various first World countries to a new economic and political  model of life" yeah sure. </p>

        <p>Interesting point about not getting in cars w strangers. Comedian Sebastian M. has a bit about that in one of his Netflix specials.</p>
<p>Similarly, remember when parents would tell kids to NEVER engage with strangers on the internet? You could be talking to a serial killer or a cannibal or your mom's boss from work-- too risky!</p>
<p>Yet nowadays kids spend their free time filming themselves dancing in their bedroom and broadcast the clip to gazillions of strangers on tiktok? The 14 year olds that I know are all, still, obsessed with trying to "go viral". Hope they grow out of that before it happens..</p>

        <p>I blame a lot of it on the education system and a lot of it on social media/the media. Above all, it‚Äôs a common sense issue, but that appears to be a thing that‚Äôs long gone. </p>
<p>And you‚Äôre right, we‚Äôre in a time where virtue signaling matters more than logic. Hence the last election. Think of the millions of people who said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know a single thing about Republicans or Democrats or who is running, but my TV and Twitter told me that anyone not on the left are mean, bad people.‚Äù You can thank a lot for that for the situation we are in now.</p>

        <p>&rt;Im sick of seeing and hearing people try to seem morally superior for taking a vaccine that, for all we know, could make them infertile or worse in the long term.</p>
<p>Fact checking you covidiots is like eating a piece of cake: </p>

        <p>People in the clinical trials are reporting infertility bro. We also don‚Äôt know the long term effects which is why I stated ‚Äúfor all we know‚Äù, to tell me or anyone that we know everything about the effects of the vaccine would be a big fat lie. I personally know 3 people who have received the vaccine and had over a week of such bad side effects that they are not allowed to get the second dose.</p>

        <p>I can't believe that <em>we're</em> the crazy ones for being worried about long term effects of this vaccine.</p>
<p>I have heard of multiple women getting pregnant during the vacine trials. Fact-check-lovers rejoice at this, "SEE! It doesn't cause fertility issues, you paranoid loons!"</p>
<p>But getting pregnant &amp; delivering a healthy baby are two very different things. </p>
<p>Many of my friends are at the age where they want to start having kids. I tell them there is nothing wrong with waiting for more data on long term affects.</p>

        <p>No, the ongoing clinical trials. Youre also one to talk, being that you linked an article from Forbes which had no scientific basis. Its foundation was simply stating ‚Äúits a rumor‚Äù over and over. Such good info, very wow</p>

        <p>The article literally has a link to a study by Nebraska Medicine. Is that not scientific enough for you? üòÇ</p>
<p>You have no basis period. You havent posted any sources. <strong>And we both know you have nothing that can back up your claims.</strong></p>
