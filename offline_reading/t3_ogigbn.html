        <p>Their job is not to forgive, or otherwise think about anything about the patient.</p>
<p>They should just do their job.</p>
<p>if they are driven by anger, frustration, resentment, political views or any other agenda that would affect their work, they should be fired.</p>

        <p>Can the families of thousands of covid patients who died of neglect ever going to forgive the nurses?</p>
<p>Are the families of the people who died of forced intubation ever going to forgive the hospitals?</p>
<p>Are the families of the people who died of lack of treatment, though doctors know and knew there are several, going to forgive them for not using them?</p>

        <p>The picture they used is the amazing.  You could look at it and think "wowee, operation COVERT-19 is wreaking havoc on this little mountain population," or perhaps the true story is "gee, must suck to be that dad after their kid fell down the mountain. Or is he looking at a newborn baby?" Because you have no fucking way of knowing what that picture is actually in reference to, especially since everyone seems to have forgotten that the CDC admittedly falsified 94% of the deaths labeled as COVERT-19 ones. Meaning there is a 6% chance that man is looking at a family member succumbing to a virus with a 99.97% survival rate according to science...or a 94% chance he's looking at a newborn baby and/or a kid who fell down a mountain. Unless it's a newborn baby that fell down a mountain and caught COVERT-19 on the way down.</p>
