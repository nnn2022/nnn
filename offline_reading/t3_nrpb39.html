    <strong>Dispelling the rumors and lies about this sub.</strong>
    <p><p>7/29/21 Edit:  Saying the word "normies" including the singular form will result in a one day ban</p>
<p>This sub is <strong>NOT against vaccinations generally</strong> (anti-vax) or even against people takin the any of the Covid vaccines.  People should be making decisions about their healthcare with their healthcare professionals, not anonymous voices on Reddit.</p>
<p><strong>However,</strong> we do strongly oppose forcing people to take the Covid vaccine on a de facto basis via segregating unvaccinated people from general society via vaccine passports and such similar concepts.</p>
<p>This sub is <strong>NOT</strong> r/the_donald <strong>2.0</strong> and that now-banned sub, Donald Trump has no official connection to this sub and more often than not, the only time he is brought up is when agitators come onto to the sub as well as spread that disinformation site-wide as well in the effort to associate us with a banned subreddit.  The only official endorsement of Trump that can be offered in solidarity with his belief that “we can’t let the cure be worse than the disease itself”.</p>
<p>In terms of the moderation team, I don’t really talk about politics or who we voted for but at least two of us aren’t even American.</p>
<p>At some point we might consider endorsing a candidate but we avoid any promotion of</p>
<p>any candidates outside the context of their policies specifically regarding the “new normal”.</p>
<p>This sub is <strong>NOT affiliated with QANON</strong> and very rarely is that assertion made aside from the malicious spreading disinformation from those trying to ban the sub.  QANON content is subject to removal and should be reported for being out of scope but this has been a non-issue as far as we have been made aware.</p>
<p>This sub does <strong>NOT promote misinformation</strong> and we welcome users to help us identify such material.</p>
<p><strong>However,</strong> due to the rapidly changing events related to the “new normal” and corporate media’s reluctance to discredit the official narrative, our sub will allow posts with news and information from less well established sources in an effort of exposing uncomfortable truths.  We have run articles that were falsely identified as misinformation by users and the media only to later have them later admit to their validity.  The moderation team makes our best efforts to vet articles and label any information that is from questionable or unverifiable sources and remove any confirmed misinformation as soon as possible.</p>
<p>This sub does <strong>NOT encourage brigading</strong> of other subs and we consistently warn our users against this behavior and take disciplinary actions including permanent bans for known violations of such behavior.</p>
<p><strong>However,</strong>  the definition of brigading has not been made clear from the Reddit admins and we do not have control over what subs any of our users choose to participate in by their own volition.</p>
<p>The sub does <strong>NOT promote hate speeach or discrimination.</strong></p>
<p>There has been a campaign of disinformation and false flag attacks that were made to try to malign r/nonewnormal as promoting hate since the organization who seeks to censor us has a  mission statement that does not cover the alleged “spread of misinformation”.  We reject hate speech and take disciplinary action for violators of it on the sub.</p>
<p><strong>We strongly denounce</strong> the libelous and unsubstantiated claims that any of us as individuals or a collective group are responsible for the spread of any specific disease and or death more than any other man, woman or child simply exercising their rights as citizens in accordance with pre-established codified laws.  We find such claims to be outrageous and inflammatory conjecture and without verifiable proof and condemn those who make such claims.</p>
<p>While we believe that it’s everyone’s personal responsibility for their own health and the health of their families, we must all remember that we do not wish sickness and suffering upon anyone.  We value the contributions of our fellow citizens in their roles as public servants providing health guidance as a valued service to society as long as it is in accordance with the personal freedoms and rights outlined in the constitution and subsequent amendments.</p></p>

        <p>That's just what happens when you bring a bunch of conspiracy people together. Turns out they all arrive from different places, but there's one thing they share: completely misinterpreting everything they read. Go make a thread and ask each person here to list their viewpoint about the entire COVID scenario, you'll wind up with 100 wildly different versions of the same conspiracy story. The only thing subscribers here have in common is thinking they're fighting "the lie", but they barely agree on anything substantial.</p>

<p>"If you are the only sane person in a world of insane, how would you know?"</p>
<p>"In the land of the blind, the one eyed man is king."</p>
<p>I've stated before that I can piss off 90% of this sub with my personal views, however I choose not to. I'm here for COVID info since I've learned a long time ago to not trust MSM, and I get really annoyed when the "experts" brush questions off without ANY explanation except "Because we say so". </p>
<p>If COVID is/was so deadly why wasn't I seeing people dying in the streets, or at the very least hearing sirens "all the time"? Why weren't they a huge amounts of death reported in every Skid Row and tent city around Paris? Why weren't every single one of the 4 public hospitals, and 2 private clinics, around me filled with dying patients (I know they weren't, I went there)? Why was the media reporting it as if it was happening when it wasn't, and bombarding folks with images that no one else had or could find outside of AP? And to be clear, I do not live out in the middle of the US in the corn fields. I live in Sarcelles France, just north of Paris (It's the "bad" part of Ile-de-France). And the cherry on top, COVID itself is so deadly, and so sneaky, you can transmit it without having symptoms yourself, but the testing method was misused and not even designed for the application it is used in.</p>
<p>Then there is COVAX. It is so "safe", so "good", and so tested that it is deployed under the banner of "emergency" and the pharmaceutical companies have ZERO liability for any possible side-effects. Of course there are no side-effects, if there were the media would be talking about it, and the side-effects would be declared like every other medication. Right? What? There are no declared side effects? None what-so-ever? Aspirin and paracetamol have declared side-effects, but COVAX has none? Correlation isn't causation. I agree. But sooner or later we might want to ask why there are blood clots, miscarriages, and death soon after people are getting vaccinated.</p>
<p>So I'm a nut and surrounded by nutty people? Fine. Give me a monocle, a top hat, and call me Mr. Peanut. At least I'll be stylish.</p>
<p>And one last parting though. One side of this is wrong, and I almost hope it is my side. Because from where I'm standing, us nuts being wrong will be a lot less problematic than if it turns out those who listened to the media and the "experts" are wrong.</p>

        <p>Definitely not Anti-vax. I think it's a phenomenal breakthrough in medicine. What gets me is the lack in liability and the lack in long term data, like you know, the 5 to 10 years in trials and testing that's required for the "okay it's generally safe" to be used in medical practice.</p>
<p>But to be fair, if I were say, 60-70 + years of age and the data suggested my chances of survival were slimmer than I were younger? Considering my age, I may or may not disregard the lack of long term data. Who knows. I prefer to take in the data. Evaluate my risks and make my own decisions. As you should.</p>

        <p>I know I'm a month late but I was just lurking initially. I got vaccinated 3 days ago and they gave me a pamphlet about side effects, how common they are and how long they may last. It also describes how the vaccine works, its effectiveness and how/by who its been approved and certified, with links for more information. I don't know if its just different in America but I have no reason to doubt this information or assume malicious intent.</p>

        <p>I live in NYC. Back in April I wasn’t able to sleep as ambulances were going off every 15 minutes. We ran out of space in our hospitals, and my friend who had a 103 fever was not able to be admitted as there was not space and her symptoms were not “bad enough”. I can’t speak for Paris but all those things you noted as showing there is a deadly epidemic DID happen in NYC.</p>

        <p>&rt; If COVID is/was so deadly why wasn't I seeing people dying in the streets, or at the very least hearing sirens "all the time"?</p>
<p>If you don't trust the reporting on covid-related deaths, look at data for deaths for all causes and explain why there were significant increases in death rates (7% in France, 12% in the US) in 2020 compared to the average of the last 5 years. </p>
<p>And look at footage from India where that exact thing is happening. People dying outside hospitals because there's not enough oxygen to go around.</p>

        <p>COVID-19 had the potential to seriously disrupt medical care worldwide. Read more about it's effects when it shutdown healthcare in Italy. Nurses and doctors worked 80+ hours a week. Without a total lock down it would've killed more than just covid patients.</p>

        <p>"COVID-19 had the potential to seriously disrupt medical care worldwide."</p>
<p>Sure it does/did.</p>
<p>That's why in France they banned a 70 year old over the counter drug (hydroxychloroquine) that could have treated it (or at the very least slowed it down), and told all doctors they are forbidden from prescribing it for treatment.</p>
<p>If it was ineffective for COVID why ban it? If it was dangerous, why not move it to the "prescription required" shelf?</p>
<p>For some reason no one can (or is willing to) answer that question. After 70 years they finally decided it was "too dangerous" for public use?</p>
<p>I know what happened in Italy, I live in France. I also know what the demographics of Italy is. Want to play a numbers game?</p>

        <p>Why weren't you seeing people dying in the street? Maybe cause they went to a fuckin hospital? As well the vaccine DOES have side effects and it's mentioned plenty. Bullshit you went to every damn hospital and saw nothing, I believe that like I believe this whole subreddit read 3600 emails the other day. Did you expect the hospitals to be like "Ah welcome deuxcolors, right this way to the dangerous quarantine ward so we can prove COVID exists to you."</p>
<p>Sorry man, you believe a nutty fringe theory with no evidence. You are not the only sane person in a world of the insane, you're a sheep in a group of the worlds idiots all reaffirming the dumbest and easiest theories they can latch onto. I've spent my life as a skeptic, I challenge everything - these COVID-deniers are no more intelligent than holocaust deniers and people still thinking we faked the moon landing. </p>
<p>Don your Mr. Peanut hat if you must, whatever you need to grasp onto to make yourself feel like you're right. Sure as fuck ain't grasping onto evidence or even a fringe theory that's creative or hard to debunk.</p>

        <p>I've always like conspiracy nuts actually, they used to have interesting theories and fun stories that made for great debate and thought experiments. You new conspiracy nuts try to craft grand scary tales in real time and fail miserably as logic and modern data dissemination proves you wrong time and time again.</p>

        <p>Well, thanks for the label. I could always use more of those.</p>
<p>Conspiracies are what they are... people working together to achieve some common end.</p>
<p>I don't know why that strikes you as "nuts". It's how things get done.</p>
<p>Ask a friend to drive to the liquor store to get some beer, and you have just conspired to possess alcohol. </p>

        <p>I wasn't talking about what a conspiracy is, I was talking about "conspiracy nuts", a group of people who blindly believe wild theories reaffirmed by online echo chambers and bullshit artists (e.g. this subreddit).</p>
<p>Was badly summarizing the definition of the word conspiracy really your rebuttal here? For funsies, here's the legal definition of conspiracy:</p>
<p>&rt;An agreement between two or more people to commit an illegal act, along with an intent to achieve the agreement's goal</p>
<p>Conspiracy comes from the word conspire, which means:</p>
<p>&rt;Make secret plans jointly to commit an unlawful or harmful act.</p>

        <p>Oh I'm sorry, as per your link, conspire means:</p>
<p>&rt;to agree together, especially secretly, to do something wrong, evil, or illegal:</p>
<p>That's so wildly different than the one I posted huh? Also on your link, it expands upon the definition below, where it says:</p>
<p>&rt;Conspire commonly means to secretly plan with multiple other people to do something wrong, evil, or illegal.</p>

        <p>&rt;I believe that like I believe this whole subreddit read 3600 emails the other day.</p>
<p>The mails are very much irrelevant. Point in case is, there has been gain of function research on bat-coronaviruses in Wuhan. This has been known to anyone interrested from the start, because it is officially documented.</p>
<p>However, when a government together with big corporations and NGOs, decide to censor that information and not allowing it to be broadly discussed, thats where I take issue.</p>
<p>You want me to act like an adult, okay, treat me as one. So instead of saying: "Impossible, crazy conspiracy theory!", maybe next time just say something along the lines of: "Well, that could be possible, we are currently investigating." -&rt; "But why would you do such a dangerous scientific experiment" -&rt; "To be exactly prepared for such cases."</p>
<p>Well, that all wouldve also neede people to admit, that no we were not not prepared. We were very much prepared for this pandemic. And, no we didnt know nothing about this novel-virus, luckily we did research such as the afformentioned that helped us understand the novel-virus quite well.</p>
<p>How can you honestly be mad about anyone spouting conspiracies, when your government lies to you over and over and over.</p>

        <p>So, the government lies all the time. I agree with that. You agree the emails are irrelevant, but this community says it held the smoking guns for everything. Is that not a lie too? Can bullshit not be called regardless if its the government or a group of morons on reddit? I like conspiracies actually, they're usually fun to think out at the very least. These COVID conspiracies are paper thin and fall apart with the lightest bit of scrutiny.</p>

        <p>Look, I was sceptical when this all began so I did some checking. Then you find stuff like Pandemic Preparedness Events such as Event 201 (and many more). So, I know that governments, ngos and big companies were prepared for pandemic events. They have planned their responses.</p>
<p>So, when I turn on the TV and suddenly every politician, ngo and big company tell me they were not prepared - Thats a lie. Obvious for everyone who checked out pandemic preparedness.</p>
<p>This is all I can tell you. There is no need for any Email to figure out people be lying.</p>
<p>However, when Media doesnt report on this fact, then the public remains largely unaware. And thats were the Emails become relevant. There is nothing new (afaik) in these emails, but again, even here, many people were actually unaware that none of these things were done in the shadows. They just never reached mainstream media. In that sense they bear some relevance.</p>
<p>Of course you can call out any bullshit. By my BS has 0 influence on your life. Government BS has profound influence on your life.</p>

        <p>While I can't remark directly on that because sometimes there is stuff that gets through prior to moderation but we are also acknowledging that optimistically that the original topic should become irrelevant but are hoping to keep it going by expanding the scope a bit.</p>
<p>For example, I think breaking news that has international interest would be good such global conflicts that are unfolding.</p>
<p>The biggest complaint we hear might be too many memes though and mods tend to agree as well but it's always just what rises to the top.</p>
<p>Would people like a "state of the sub" kind of thing?  We have received a lot of good feedback from users but that might be a good way to make improvements.</p>

        <p>I really like this sub. I think it’s a breath of fresh air on reddit but just to interject, weren’t the things spoken about here considered crazy conspiracy theories about 15 months ago?</p>
<p>Quarantines, forced vaccinations, vaccine passports, bio weapons, etc. were all solidly in the realm of conspiracy no more than a year and a half ago. And yet here we are. I doubt these discussions would be happening here now if not for the people who stuck their necks out early on, when it was still considered just crazy conspiracy talk.</p>
<p>Everything is a crazy conspiracy theory until it isn’t. Everything is healthy skepticism until your research is attacked by those who push a narrative. And then, rightfully so, people feel attacked, double down, and get labeled overly reactionary. Most just don’t want to be saddled with the conspiracy label, and go out of their way to prove their case. </p>
<p>Not about politics? The “pandemic” is nothing if not a political phenomenon. Sure, maybe we don’t want to outwardly make this a blue vs. red thing but we’d be kidding ourselves if we don’t address the political phenomena surrounding the virus. Amazing how the virus/pandemic changes the moment it crosses state and/or national lines. And how some countries weren’t affected by a global pandemic at all. </p>
<p>Viruses come and go but how it gets handled politically will set the direction of this nation, arguably the world, for decades to come. For those reasons, I wouldn’t be so quick to remove conspiracy speculation and the political component to all this. They’ve helped us get to the point that we’re having this discussion at all.</p>

        <p>Conspiracy speculation is fine, but unless you're conspiracy directly involves covid-19 restrictions, this isn't the place for it. Qanon stuff isn't banned because it's false, it's banned for not being about COVID 19.  That's what out of scope means.</p>

        <p>It is political, but it's important to consider how that looks across varying political contexts - as well as avoiding reducing it to the US context, which can end up just sounding sports team-support partisan, it helps add extra context to the US political context itself.</p>

        <p>Yet, most of the “hot” posts as I write this are anti-“left”. Sure looks like people here are pushing the political narrative. I know plenty of people who others would label as “far left”, e.g. green party supporters, or your basic Dem, who are questioning the COVID narrative. This constant “left” bashing doesnt serve the cause. But I suppose thats the point. More division, less cohesion.</p>
<p>If the mods are serious about this not being political then how about removing these posts and keeping those that are focused on what this sub is meant to be about as stated above?</p>

        <p>It already is politicized. Fluoride, a by-product of animal waste/fertilizer, as well as cement and steel production, is a neurotoxin with noted adverse mental effects at low levels. It was/is heavily politicized, and as a result, you likely need to go out of your way to reduce the amount of the industrial by-product, fluoride, that you intake from tap water.</p>

<p>I don't think blanket statements about Trump supporters are helpful or accurate. There is a lot of evidence of people following Trump and getting burned. It's obviously extremely helpful to be skeptical of any politician. But there's lots of proof that some Trump supporters blindly follow anything he says.</p>
<p>I personally think that Trump and his family getting the vaccine in secret sends a questionable message. Why did he fight so hard to say that COVID wasn't a problem? Why did he fight so hard to claim credit for the vaccines' development? Why did he not want people to know he trusted the vaccine?</p>

        <p>Look I’m not trying to talk politics about trumps policies or anything like that he’s not perfect and any criticism is definitely valid. I’m not saying that he doesn’t deserve that. But Trump even in his latest statements which go viral in trump supporting circles (trust me I’m a part of them I know and if you don’t believe me go check out some trump subs). I remember a recent one where he is still saying that the vaccine he developed is helping keep people safe. despite this most republicans won’t get vaccinated he made it very clear what he wants his supporters to do and they aren’t doing it. If you want to call us mindless followers be my guest I respect your right to an opinion but we clearly aren’t good at it if that were the case. Trump isn’t a politician I hope we can both agree on that. for once he is agreeing with mostly democrats and saying that we should all get vaccinated to keep us safe. It amazes me that mostly democrats are still fighting him when he’s agreeing with you for once this isn’t some political war its humanity and peoples beliefs overlap with others we might not like sometimes but we have to take that as a good thing instead of creating more division. I remember I saw an interview a few months back by Steven crowder with I wanna say a Hawaiian democrat senator or governor I forget which but she was talking about making sure that big tech companies treat us all fairly and despite being a very strong Republican I believed if my state had a democrat like that I’d vote for them. We need to start coming together on the few things we all agree with instead of causing more and more breakup. If there’s one thing the capital riots showed us it’s that this political division is getting worse and worse and we see it on the opposite side with Black Lives Matter. I’m not here to talk about politics and if this is right or wrong but undisputedly both caused some peaceful protests some riots and some deaths. I hope we can both agree that’s not good. We need to come together to stop things like that from happening on any side. We gotta be ok with other’s opinions and create a good world where we can respect everyone’s opinion instead of just saying it’s us vs them. That doesn’t help anything ultimately regardless of anything we’re all human and that deserves some respect and common decency towards each other that I think we need more of. And that’s what I believe trump is trying to do he was coming together with democrats to say yea get vaccinated I disagree with it but I respect it. As does almost every trump supporter I have talked to</p>

        <ul>
<li>Trump did not develop the vaccine. Congress approved funds for Operation Warp Speed, for which the Trump administration passed on to some vaccine companies. Notably absent from that group was Pfizer, the first vaccine to be approved. Pfizer even announced human trials prior to the creation of Warp Speed. Moderna was approved shortly after Pfizer and a couple months later, Johnson &amp; Johnson was approved. Both those were part of Operation Warp Speed, which provided assistance on funding and logistics (not development).  </li>
<li>It is great that he is encouraging it, but it would have been great if he didn't call COVID a hoax to begin with. Early, aggressive, and an effective responses to the threat would have drastically changed what has become 'the new normal' and made it a lot easier to return to our previous state. Instead he dragged his feet and called it fake news.</li>
<li>Why isn't Trump a politician? He ran for public office, won, used his position of power to influence policy, and a myriad of other actions and duties of politicians. I can't think of a single definition whereas Trump is <em>not</em> considered a politician. </li>
<li>I'm not calling you mindless followers, I specifically said that overarching statements like that are not helpful. I implied that among Trump supporters, some do act like mindless followers. </li>
<li>To imply that Trump is 'coming together with Democrats' is pretty dubious. I could be wrong, but if Trump has done anything besides mention that the vaccine is safe and he recommends it, that's quite different than working with Democrats to spread the message of vaccine safety and efficacy. </li>
<li>Debates and opinions are great, and I do believe we are sharing those. I wish there was more of that</li>

        <p>&rt;Nobody lying about this sub or its members gives a shit about anyone denying their accusations.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>It's basically like trying to convince them you're not Satan, but every denial is taken as proof positive. Or thinking that you can provide evidence to prove your innocence at one of Stalin's show trials. The verdict is predetermined going in.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately it doesn't matter what statements you make because there is a concerted effort to silence any opinion that challenges the narrative.  Science professionals, doctors, etc are being intimidated so that they don't speak up about what they know and what they are seeing.  The subs like r/Coronavirus and it's offshoots are all moderated by individuals that are making it their mission to make sure only the correct information is posted.  You have a subreddit r/NoNewNormalBan that exists because they want this one banned.  How does that work with anti-brigade rules???  This is an information war folks!</p>

        <p>Oh man, you are in for a treat my friend. </p>
<p>The influx of tourists has been so great it basically became a meme to make fun of it. Now before I go further I must stress the fact that this made the news multiple times, and it was clear to see by everyone. </p>
<p>We got A LOT of black Americans over here who seemed to get into trouble at every corner. I’m talking vandalized hotels and Airbnb properties, people leaving lots of trash on beaches, run ins with the police, fighting and arguing with each other and with locals. General inappropriate behavior. It was definitely strange, but I say this with all honesty, it happened. </p>
<p>So to circle back to your question, tourism is still thriving over here despite the pandemic. People have tried to raise concerns over spread because a lot of these tourists do not wear masks, but it hasn’t been as big of a deal as it was made out to be. Check my profile and you’ll see the case graph as of last week, we’re hitting all time lows.</p>

        <p>Awesome, and completely agree.</p>
<p>I am Canadian, not a Trump supporter, no TDS. See myself as lefty/liberal (but very concerned about the debt countries are racking up).</p>
<p>I think the damage the lockdowns and restrictions have done to our children's' future is immense.</p>
<p>I think the news channels like CNN sell advertising space through fear, not information or analysis.</p>
<p>I think we are in a moral or social panic like the Salem Witch Trials.</p>
<p>I'm fully vaccinated for deployments and travel to the Middle East, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Caribbean. My children are all vaccinated. I am pro-approved vaccines or pro-long term tested vaccines. It's not about the needle; t's about the 10 years of safety data. It's about thalidomide and what Dr Frances Kelsey achieved for 100,000 Americans  babies but wasn't able to do for Canada.</p>

        <p>I had to <a href="https://youtu.be/pASE_TgeVg8">look that one up</a> and yeah, that's even better than the unimaginative delivery I would have gone with.  </p>
<p>I can see why this was made though.  For whatever reason, Americans in my experience tend to rip on Canadians for no reason in the form of jokes based on the few common stereotypes we have mentioned in the video.  It's in jest and light-hearted but it almost seemed like low-key bigotry now that I see it from Joe's perspective, haha.</p>

        <p>Fair point, but if you think about it, Canada apologizes for celebrating medal wins at the Olympics, but one of our larger bursts of patriotism took place around a beer commercial.  Some of the stereotypes are kinda warranted :)</p>

        <p>Yeah I had to go around explaining my whole story about my "social". I had a brand new one so no credit score or history etc. I got it down to a science after awhile.</p>
<p>Yeah maybe she had only dealt with French Canadians before or something. </p>
<p>But she was so earnest about it and not messing with me. It did throw me off and I didn't know what to make of it at the time. It was in the south and I don't really know what they all know about the great white north. I was the first Canadian that many of them had ever met. 
A common stereotype in Canada (but true): 
Canadians are obsessed with America. America forgets Canada exists.</p>

<p>Your post is bang on - and so many people have no clue who Dr. Kelsey was or what she did.  I reference her work quite often, good to see another Canadian who knows it.</p>

        <p>Yeah, in general it's something we want to avoid but if there is a particular race such as the Newsom recall, where he basically represents everything the sub is opposed to, it makes sense to take a position on that. </p>
<p>2024 is a long way away fortunately but I was talking about more local or state elections and that kind of thing if there are candidates of any party who have a nnn type platform.</p>

<p>Oh by the way, speaking as a subscriber to anyone who is listening, RECALL NEWSOM.   He's decided to extend the CA state of emergency even after we open up.   He can't abide by losing his arbitrary forever powers.</p>
<p>And, in CA, even more than recalling Newsom WE NEED LIMITS ON EMERGENCY POWERS.   They have to be time limited, and need to be renewed by a vote every 6 weeks thereafter.    Please someone get this on the docket!   How do we get <em>this</em> petition off the ground?</p>

        <p>It is sad that the rational side of the debate has to go through all this and still fail to get to CoVid cultists, but they can straight up wish death upon anyone slightly critical of the narrative, spread blatant misinformation (such as grossly overstating the dangers of the virus or advocating for inefficient countermeasures) that can be easily proven wrong even by official statistics and research, but because they are supported by media and the government they get off the hook.</p>

My wife is vaxed , friends vaxed, some family. Its their decision, I hope they and all who have been vaxed stay healthy and have no adverse effects. 
I thought about it and no amount of bribing, mandating, etc will make me get it. It's just not for me and that's fine as well.</p>

        <p>I personally think that QAnon, just like flat earth stuff, is an artificial distraction, yet if someone genuinely believes it, what's so inherently unacceptable about it? There is a lot of anti-scientific and unsubstantiated nonsense in this sub, but as long as there is no threats, calls to violence or behavior that makes normal functioning of this sub impossible, I don't see what's the big idea, aside from trying to make concessions to the other side.</p>

        <p>to me its pretty clear Qanon is used to discredit anyone talking about elite paedo rings (a very real phenomenon), the same tactic is used on vaccines, make anyone with skepticism about this specific rushed vaccine, the same as the born again christian anti vaxxers who rely on the bible for proof etc.</p>

        <p>This subreddit is filled with people from all walks of beliefs and people. From leftists to Trump people. </p>
<p>What's good is that how amazing it has all united us on this sub. It doesn't matter which political side or beliefs you hold because that doesn't matter. What matters is that we recognize that the system is failing people, lying to people, and deceiving people in scales of which we've never seen before. We are the ones who will speak truth in the era of lies and to bring light to the dark and deceived. And I guarantee you, once you wake up, you can never go back. </p>
<p>So there's more and more of us each day all around the world.</p>

        <p>The most common rumor I hear when I ask people why they don't like this subreddit is that we "spread misinformation". No we don't we just share what's not shown on news stations that a lot of people follow (CNN, New York Times, etc.). These people don't think that news would censor the truth.</p>

        <p>Seems like it's just the trendiest angle for them to use per the latest media narrative that's been going since 1/6.  It's tied into the relatively recent QANON stuff they try to make this about.</p>
<p>But for all of the cries of "misinformation" I've found very few people are actually trying to call it out or correct any of it.  They just know that it's something the media will bite on.</p>
<p>It's funny because when I was in school, the default mode was to not trust the government and it wasn't a partisan thing per se but probably goes back to the war in Vietnam and how unpopular that became.</p>
<p>One thing that has baffled me about liberalism going back the last couple decades is how the anti-war movement basically was non-existent as far as I could see, among students, professors and media.</p>

        <p>I definitely feel attacked here as someone who did get vaccinated and vaccinated my kids. I 100% support the ideals here of getting back to normal and ending mask mandates and having the vaccine be optional. </p>
<p>I support getting kids back in school and getting people back to work. I support opening live theaters. </p>
<p>But I got super downvoted and criticized here last week for saying I had to vaccinate my son or they were not going to let him attend his dance intensive. I felt forced. But it was that or he miss out on FREE training (he got a scholarship) that was thousands of dollars. Training he definitely needs. </p>
<p>So maybe if this board really is not anti vaccine and is just pro choice- they need to act like it. Instead of alienating your supporters</p>

        <p>I think a lot of people think that the higher percentage of the population that does means the  passports will be implemented as well.  I don't like when people are attacked like that in general but I think the number of agitators on the sub can put people on edge sometimes.  I know it's happened to me.</p>

        <p>In spite of all of the haters who try to rain on our parade, there is something promising about how people come together here.</p>
<p>It seems like if you just go by what's on TV or the vast majority of social media, the situation sometimes seems almost hopeless but the people I know IRL and the people in this sub are reminders that things are hopefully more normal than they appear.</p>

        <p>Whats your response to the Justice Served ban message some people get for joining your subreddit? IE the misinformation and brigading accusations as to why they hate users coming in from this sub? Do you plan to tell them to stop using their bot to auto ban members of this subreddit from joining that one? "You have been banned for participating in NoNewNormal.

        <p>Today my thoughts are that for the first time after this past year I feel sad, angry and upset. I made the mistake of watching the morning news. After months it seems to still be all covid all the time on TV. I watch those moronic commercials where some medical company shows people doing zoom calls with a mask on and no one else in the room and people who are supposed to be educated doctors standing for the camera with paper masks on when even Fauci said they do nothing and offer no real protection. After a month the media says they have made inroads and people are getting the shots and they show 52% of the population and it was 52% two weeks ago. They push for vaccine passports either directly or indirectly by fear mongering some new more deadly variant. Everywhere I see on the web that Fauci should be in prison for financing gain of function research and yet they show him on TV as the great leader. I feel like I live in Russia during the cold war when everything that came out of state run media was the opposite of reality. My daughter took the vaccine three weeks ago even though she had been fine for months but luckily no real side effects so far.  I am now just sitting and waiting to see what happens to her. I have always done enormous amount of research on my own and so knew about COVID in December of 2019. I watched it through leaked social media posts transferred to our social in order to work around the Chinas censorship. I know it was pretty lethal at the beginning. I assume that the virus lost it's potency as experts said it would. Viruses tend to mutate to increase spread by becoming less lethal not more. The media attributes the drop in cases to the vaccine when it appears to be a natural thing that happens without a vaccine. I come here for alternative viewpoints so that I can try and discern what is really happening from all opposing viewpoints since the media is so corrupted by big pharma's money.</p>

        <p>If people are paid well enough, they become apathetic and subservient, AKA bought.  Healthcare pros and everyone in media are the villains in this story.
You really can't expect much from the general populous.  I mean, look how gung ho people got with the masks...  And now to avoid the embarrassment they should be feeling the defense mechanism instead is to double down on everything.  They will not let us be right about this in any way.</p>

        <p>You mods have created a safe place for free speech, where folks can comment or post things that are legal and factual, and relative to the history of events that led to this point. Items that would take an extensive search to find going solo. It's not disinformation to discuss how campaign financing has been corrupted, how centralization of power has controlled a narrative, how academic elites like Elsevier's The Lancet might be motivated to create confusion around reporting biases. Academic leaders from medical journals everywhere have been sounding alarms on corporate shareholder corruption of research focus and publications for years. Fiona Godlee BMJ 2015 editor, Arnold Relman New England Journal of Medicine former editor Marcia Angel 2009 former editor in chief of New England JoM, Richard Norton editor in Chief of The Lancet, Peter Gøtzche cofounder Cochrane Collaboration, Dr. Richard Smith former editor BMJ, Prof Douglas Altman 1994 BMJ chief statistical advisor have all been speaking into a void.
The fact that people get banned from other subs just for joining this one, shows us exactly how shareholders can censor through social media, to protect their investments, even as they flex their corporate "first amendment rights" to corrupt our campaign financing beyond imagination. It also shows how fragile their hold on the narrative is, because if they were invincible, they wouldn't bother with FB, Twitter, Reddit, etc. They already own our major media outlet publications, our major book publications, our medical journals, yet they're quickly moving to control our movement, discussions and searches online. It is difficult for most of us to grasp how centralized power has become over the past 20years, or the full implications of where we're headed (so of course some folks worry about reptilians or very abstract threats). 
You all must know that your followers that skim through a soup of silly posts and memes to find decent bits of data, links and resources are actually a much higher number than publicly facing. It's a shame that we can't just join without risking censor elsewhere, because some of us actually do want to be able to post a crumb here and there without being immediately spotted as a corporate stakeholder dissident. Oh excuse me, I meant conspiring theorist.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the thoughtful comments. So true that it's about being free to make our own choice about our personal health. So grateful to have this refuge from the relentless COVID mafia. I say this as someone who hates Trump and everything he stands for. And I also hate Newsom. Because it's not about mindlessly following politicians.

        <p>I have a BS from CAL in Molecular Biology. I have all my vaccinations except COVID19 from which I am medically exempt. Experimental treatments cannot be mandatory as per Geneva Conventions and Nuremberg Code. </p>
<p>The PCR tests were run at too many cycles up until inauguration day. This was done to gin up as much as 90% false positive results. People who signed up for test but left before getting the test were notified that they were positive. Hospitals and doctors BOTH get more money for COVID patients. Democrats wanted Trump out of office. As soon as he was gone, the vaccines came out. The cycles of the tests were reduced from 40-50 to 28-35. Even Fauci said no live virus was ever cultured from a PCR test run above 34 cycles. The tests were picking up dead nucleotides with vague homology, not true SARS 2 viral RNA. </p>
<p>"What is now sort of evolving into a bit of a standard," Fauci said, is that "if you get a cycle threshold of 35 or more ... the chances of it being replication-confident are minuscule." 
"It's very frustrating for the patients as well as for the physicians," he continued, when "somebody comes in, and they repeat their PCR, and it's like [a] 37 cycle threshold, but you almost never can culture virus from a 37 threshold cycle." 
"So, I think if somebody does come in with 37, 38, even 36, you got to say, you know, it's just dead nucleotides, period." </p>
<p>Therefore, Fauci himself has confirmed that PCR testing is not reliable at high cycle thresholds. </p>
<p>I was in UC Health in September last year and they had 12-14 cases. The entire state had &lt;200 hospitalizations. </p>
<p>Covid 19 is the flu rebranded. All flu deaths disappeared bc they were classified as COVID deaths. Anyone who died within 28 days after a false positive test was added to the death toll. Motorcyclists who died in accidents were classified as COVID deaths. </p>
<p>Add to this the fact that Fa u ci paid for the gain of function research in Wuhan on coronaviruses and before that @ UNC and you have a hoax. Fauc i paid $900,000 to Wuhan Institute of Virology from 2014-2019. https://nypost.com/2021/05/25/fauci-admits-nih-funding-of-wuhan-lab-denies-gain-of-function/<br>
There are a lot of unknowns, speculation and differences of opinion on these topics. But let’s start with what we do know: In 2014, the NIH awarded a grant to the U.S.-based EcoHealth Alliance to study the risk of the future emergence of coronaviruses from bats. In 2019, the project was renewed for another five years, but it was canceled in April 2020 — three months after the first case of the coronavirus was confirmed in the U.S. Fauci knew what kind of research they were doing. Read his emails. </p>
<p>SARS2 was made in a lab from Bat CoV + SARS1 + HIV.  Researchers in India recognized the sequences from HIV binding site genes. Those were inserted by a lab bc there is no way those genes evolved naturally to include those. The Nobel Laureate who discovered HIV arrived at the same conclusion. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usyQgPU-VrI</p>

<p>The article was withdrawn under pressure or coercion because it alludes to the creation of a bioweapon and did not hew to the narrative that this is a naturally-occurring bat virus. </p>
<p>Check out Ralph Baric’s research:
A SARS-like cluster of circulating bat coronaviruses shows potential for human emergence | Nature Medicine</p>

<p>The lab leak theory is horse shit; they created this thing and released it on purpose to get people to clamor for the “vaccine.”</p>
<p>He and Bill Gates predicted a pandemic. Gates said vaccines were his best investment in 2019 and that 2020 would be a great year to invest in vaccines. </p>
<p>https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2019/01/17/bill-gates-says-this-is-the-best-investment-he-has-ever-made.html</p>
<p>Gates also said in a TED talk that “if we do a good job with vaccines, we can reduce population growth.”</p>
<p>These mRNA vaccines tell your body to make spike proteins which are actually damaging to vascular endothelial cells. That is why the blood clots, heart inflammation, strokes and deaths are occurring. Pregnancies have terminated. Nursing newborns have died in the days following mom’s vaccination. Fertility may be permanently impacted if the spike protein inflames the placenta in the next pregnancy. Over 5,000 deaths reported to VAERS in the US and 15,000 deaths in the EU since the vaccines have come out suggest that more people are dying from the vaccines than maybe even COVID19. </p>
<p>I don’t know anyone who has had COVID nor died of it. I’m totally suspicious of the vaccines and the marketing campaign behind it. They made the disease scary so you’d clamor for the vaccine. The vaccine is thought to also cause prions which would render the vaccinated into zombies. </p>
<p>US taxpayers created SARS 2 and then also paid for experimental vaccines, both of which are harmful. </p>
<p>Succession planners are saying they will have to replace the vaccinated workforce within three years. </p>

        <p>I saw some posts within the last week that fit into what I described, but I don't remember which ones they were. I'm not against people having their own beliefs, i just feel that it doesn't add to the particular conversations that we're trying to have on this stuff</p>

        <p>There's /r/endthelockdowns for people that like a tightly moderated community... But the reason this subreddit has far more subscribers is because there is generally more freedom of speech and more freedom of thought allowed here.</p>
<p>Freedom like that makes people uncomfortable sometimes when it goes into a direction they don't agree with, but really -- it's why you're here. It's why we're all here. It's why more restrictive places are colorless and devoid of humor, creativity, and innovative thought or speculation on what is being done to us.</p>
<p>Part of the old normal was that is WASN'T a corporate-political monoculture, and I'm grateful that the mods here keep that kind of freedom as much as possible here.</p>

        <p>Maybe my other comment got deleted, but thedonald was better than 99 percent of subreddits and it got banned for things that brigaders posted. This was also a few months before reddit turned anti police and every subreddit was posting pro rioters, pro violence comments non stop.  Reddit is trash.</p>

        <p>There is no such thing as “transphobia”. No one is scared of trans people. In fact, an overwhelming amount of the population has the proper stance - they don’t give a fuck. Now, there are some people who despise or hate trans people, but the proper term for that is “bigotry” - get your shit straight.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking - people pushing for the rights of the unvaccinated, are also the whole package - anti-mask, anti-vax, pro-Qanon, pro-Trump, and on and on.</p>

        <p>What's interesting is during the throes of the pandemic, the anti-maskers endangered other people. </p>
<p>Anti-maskers are now anti-vaxxers. And now that most people are vaccinated, and anti-vaxxers only endanger themselves. So who cares.</p>

        <p>Life has risks but we can work together to make life better for everyone as long as we stand on the foundation of natural rights for everybody. If society stops life to avoid risks, surrenders all rights and responsibilities to "authorities" that claim to protect us from life risks then we will not fear life's risks only because we have essentially stopped living.</p>

        <p>Hello.</p>
<p>I just looked up this sub, cuz I heart a lot of it. So my first thing to do was to red this post.</p>
<p>So, its starts with that the sub is not anti-vaxx, just dont want to get forced to take the vaccination.</p>
<p>After it I scrooled down. Thats where is the twist. I saw a lot of posts againist vaccinations, my favorite one was the 25 card one.</p>
<p>So here is my question: did you didnt told the truth in this post, or just a few people on this sub who is more than just dont wanted to get forced to take the vaccine?</p>
<p>Sorry if its sounds hars or insulting.
Have a nice day.</p>

        <p>Have you guys ever thought about <em>why</em> you need to dispel these "rumors" so adamantly? Is it possible that the things your claim to reject, you actually espouse?</p>
<p>You claim to not be anti-vax, but almost <em>every single one</em> of the topics I saw about vaccination was:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Insulting someone who got vaccinated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Claiming the vaccine is a hoax (apparently as the virus is also a hoax?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Claiming the vaccine kills you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Talking about fraudulently using someone else's vaccinations records as their own</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saying that getting infected and surviving is somehow better than getting vaccinated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Claiming that their family is brainwashed for wanting to wear a mask (not exactly vaccine-related, but still wild)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making fun of people as they post their vaccination stories</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Claiming that vaccinated people are causing reactions in unvaccinated people</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>... so can you guys <em>really</em> claim to not be anti-vax?</p>

        <p>I find it better to try to educate people who are ignorant with something instead of chastise them since because that only causes resentment.</p>
<p>It may come as a shock to you but not all of the many thousand users here agree on everything and it's disingenuous to think that this list of bad ideas is representative of anything other than a manicured list made to have us look bad.  We all know that a significant of the bad behavior is coming from bogus accounts from bad actors as well but if you really want to see some twisted stuff we have saved some of the finest/depraved work your team has to offer such as the threats against us and our families that seem to be a staple of your harassment repertoire.</p>
<p>But what am I even doing though, haha.  Your little lecture rings a little hollow coming from a fan of some of the most popular hate subs on Reddit not to mention uplifitng content like "brutalbeatdowns".</p>

        <p>Excellent post.   Thank you for clarifying the purpose of this sub.   </p>
<p>I know that many left-leaning people were very skeptical of the speed of the vaccine roll-out when it was under Trump, but most people magically thought it was ok after Biden took office.  Which is a pretty bad reason to change your skepticism, since nothing changed other than the administration in charge.   </p>
<p>I did my own research on this subject, and it was clear that masks do work against this virus and many others.  There is a reason we had the lowest number of flu cases in decades, it’s because we were mostly all wearing masks which slowed the spread of the flu and Covid.<br>
I also did my research on the vaccine.  I was not the first in line to get it, but I read as many scientific articles on the new mRNA vaccines and monitored the early reports of complications and decided that based on all I’ve seen and read, it was safe for me and my wife to take.   </p>
<p>Personally, I think the best way to get people to take the vaccine voluntarily is by having people ask their personal doctors about it, and their questions about it.  Also doing lotteries seems to help in some states.  But I am really sad that this turned into a political issue.  I wish people could do a better job of separating their political opinions and identities from what is best for the country, best for their families, and best for themselves.   I do really think if people could look at this outside of politics, most people would come to the conclusion that following our doctors advice is the best option for everyone.</p>

        <p>i dont want the vaccine for my owns reasons, i hate the restrictions and lockdowns and pointless mask wearing in certain situtations.</p>
<p>but i get so annoyed by the anti-vaxxers here screaming 'masks dont work 100%!' and 'your all sheep!" it just makes us look stupid. but if you call them out they say 'but fauci's emails say' which is such a hyperbole because they complained at other for following fauci in the first place so why take his emails as gospel?</p>
<p>masks work, they do their job maybe not 100% of what people think but they work. but if you go eat somewhere and take it off for an hour why do you suddenly need to wear it to go to the toilet? if anyone had covid its in the building now so its so stupid. STAFF dont need masks but customers do.</p>

        <p>But there was a post by a 14 year old the other day who didn't want the vax and people on this sub totally bombarded her with incorrect info and encouraged her to not listen to her parents of medical professions. </p>
<p>I read comments comparing the vaccine to chemo therapy the other day.  Like seriously I've even seen your own member get down voted to oblivion for simply being OK with the vaccine or vaccinated, If you aren't antivax why do you have to make a post to dispel the rumors? Which are in fact correct that this sub contains anti vax content that is regularly posted and your members insult others and mock them for wanting to vaccinate or being vaccinated.</p>

<p>"To study the transmissibility of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 index cases, eFigure 8 in the Supplement summarizes 27 studies reporting household secondary attack rates from symptomatic index cases and 4 studies from asymptomatic or presymptomatic index cases. Estimated mean <strong>household secondary attack rate from symptomatic index cases</strong> (18.0%; 95% CI, 14.2%-22.1%) <strong>was significantly higher than from asymptomatic or presymptomatic index cases</strong> (<strong>0.7%</strong>; 95% CI, 0%-4.9%; P &lt; .001), although there were few studies in the latter group. These <strong>findings are consistent with other household studies reporting asymptomatic index cases as having limited role in household transmission."</strong></p>

        <p>Looks like I hit a nerve. ;-)</p>
<p>If you’ve actually bothered to read the study you’re citing and the papers it’s referencing instead of reading about it in some dodgy Facebook post, you would’ve realised that it doesn’t disprove presymptomatic spread. <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/dec/28/facebook-posts/no-recent-study-didnt-find-no-asymptomatic-spread-/">There is a good overview of what you’ve missed</a>. In summary:</p>
<p>(1) Presymptomatic spread has a lower attack rate but is definitely possible.</p>
<p>(2) The study looked only at household transmission, missing an important piece of the puzzle, which is community spread. The findings cannot be used to inform public policies targeting community spread, such as mask mandates or lockdowns.</p>
<p>(3) The number of studies on asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission this meta-analysis looked at is very small, which the authors themselves admit. It’s only four studies [<a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/11/20-2263_article">26</a>, <a href="https://www.e-epih.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.4178/epih.e2020046">43</a>, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa1166/5893024">44</a>, <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/8/20-1274_article">52</a>].</p>
<p>When you look at the cited papers, you’ll notice that two of them [43, 44] weren’t even designed to study asymptomatic/presymptomatic transmission. The results are merely a by-product. Paper [26] is also the only one that analysed a considerable number of asymptomatic/presymptomatic cases (hundreds). It found the household attack rates for symptomatic, presymptomatic and asymptomatic cases to be 14.4%, 6.1% and 4.4% respectively. What’s more, it observed <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/11/20-2263-t3">the overall attack rate (i.e. household and community spread combined) to be comparable for asymptomatic/presymptomatic and symptomatic people</a>. As mentioned above, paper [43] didn’t try to measure the presymptomatic attack rate. It did, however, observe it to be possible. Paper [44] didn’t look at presymptomatic transmission at all, and paper [52] only at 11 such cases. If the attack rate were to be consistent with [26], they shouldn’t find a single secondary infection in that sample.</p>
<p>The fact that the meta-analysis lumped together asymptomatic and presymptomatic cases is rather questionable, considering that there is little evidence for asymptomatic spread but a wealth of evidence for presymptomatic spread (<a href="https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=a20501000000&amp;bid=0015&amp;list_no=366637&amp;act=view">1</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120970/">2</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7184331/">3</a>, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.20135194v4">4</a>). Many studies report that peak infectiousness occurs shortly before the onset of symptoms (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5">5</a>, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(20)30172-5/fulltext">6</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121626/">7</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2196-x">8</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131901/">9</a>). The first paper estimated the proportion of presymptomatic transmission to be 44%. Paper [52] also observed that the SIR in crowded non-household settings can be as high as 43.5%. This all shows why the restrictions target non-symptomatic people as well.</p>
<p>Lastly, please, do explain how I’m moving the goal posts.</p>

        <p>Because it corrects the misinformation you're spreading. You don't have to read the Politifacts article. You can read my post, which goes more in-depth, the meta-analysis you cited and the papers it references and verify the content of my post for yourself. You don't have to be a sheep and mindlessly believe any crap you read on social media. ;-)</p>
<p>And you should care because by being a selfish idiot you may potentially kill other people. Like I said, being a presymptomatic spreader is more dangerous to others than drunk driving.</p>

<p>No, but seriously. The cognitive dissonance is astonishing. It takes double effort to make your words not match reality at all. Kinda like getting 0 points in a multiple choice test. It takes some level of selfawareness to be <em>this</em> wrong.</p>

        <p>Yes, it wasn't hate speech but I lost my cool and said something out of line.</p>

        <p>Yep. Nothing more hilarious than <em>this</em> subreddit claiming not be anti-vaccine and claiming not to “promote” misinformation. Perhaps that wasn’t the intent but....look around. It’s 99% anti-vaxx rhetoric, 87% misinformation, 76% right-wing gibberish, and 97% baseless conspiracy theory. And if you’re thinking, wait, that doesn’t add up...it’s because these things overlap.</p>

<p>I imagine that they'll start taking hardship early disbursements from their 401k's when they still refuse to take a shot.  How about their exercised brokerage accounts for capital gains taxes too :)  I love how we're going to get rid of the stepped up basis for inherited assets too; that way when your unvaxxed ass chokes to death on your own spit your descendants will get to pay the tax on your capital gains that you didn't</p>

<p>Also by the way, you're spouting unfalsifiable bullshit. You're basically saying "the measures work, they just didn't work because you didn't follow them closely enough!".
