    <strong>Think the Pfizer jab’s safe? – 3rd Gov. update on adverse reactions to Covid Vaccines released!</strong>
    <p><p><strong>The UK Government and Medicines &amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) have released the third report highlighting adverse reactions to the Covid vaccines. Last week we dissected the Government’s second report which covered data inputted to the MHRA Yellow Card Scheme from the 9th December 2020 through to the 31st January 2021</strong> <a href="https://dailyexpose.co.uk/2021/02/14/think-the-oxford-jab-is-safe-adverse-reactions/"><strong>(see here)</strong></a><strong>. This week we’re going to dissect the third report so that you don’t have to</strong>, <strong>and we’re afraid the situation has got worse.</strong></p>
<p>In last week’s report we told how the rate of adverse reactions to the Covid vaccines had increased from the rate seen in the Government’s first report <a href="https://dailyexpose.co.uk/2021/02/08/official-data-on-adverse-reactions-to-vaccines/">(see our analysis of report one here) </a>in which the rate equated to 1 in every 333 people suffering an adverse reaction. This had sadly increased to 1 in every 250 people in the Government’s second report. We’re pleased to confirm that the rate has not increased but sorry to say the current rate is still 1 in every 250 people who receive a dose of the Covid vaccine suffering from an adverse reaction.</p>
<p>Last week we concentrated on some of the major adverse reactions to the Oxford vaccine, these included 5 people going deaf, 40 suffering from tinnitus, 6 cases of cardiac arrest (heart attack), 8 cases of people going blind, 11 cases of brain damage, 40 people suffering seizures, and a total of 90 reported fatal outcomes (Deaths) as of the 31st January 2021.</p>
<p>This time we decided to take a look at some of the more serious adverse reactions to the Pfizer / BioNTech vaccine <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/962405/COVID-19_mRNA_Pfizer-_BioNTech_Vaccine_Analysis_Print.pdf">(you can see the Government report here)</a>, and this is what we found…</p>

        <p>Well, if you go here, you can see there are many deaths for the small number of reports that exist:<br>

<p>Now to tell you if it's safe, we need to wait atleast 2/3 years.</p>

        <p>So, is this vaccine altering the proteins you produce because it uses "mRNA technology"?</p>
