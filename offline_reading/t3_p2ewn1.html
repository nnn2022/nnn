    <strong>Rules for thee and not for me: Google founder Larry Page wangles New Zealand residency by flying in his "sick" child, despite 100% quarantine.</strong>
    <p><p>Larry Page applied for New Zealand's special SHTF residency program for billionaires, but because the country has 100% closed borders right now, could not complete his status by actually flying there. </p>
<p>So what does this rich prick do? Well, from his covid hidey-hole in Fiji, he fakes up a medical crisis for his son, and gets the New Zealand government to medivac them both in, quarantine be damned. They stayed just long enough for Page to qualify for New Zealand residence. </p>
<p>Why didn't he just fly his kid to the US? Because stfu, peasant. That's why. </p>
