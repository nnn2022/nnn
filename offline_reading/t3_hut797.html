    <strong>I will not be bowing to anyone wearing a mask</strong>
    <p><p>Nor any other form of outward respect, yes people should be treated equal but i want to get out how much i hate facemasks and how much i hate those who wear them, who often have no respect for themselves or others anyway, i will stay away from them, stare at them because they often stare at me, but i'm not sure what to do if someone tries to force me to wear a mask yet.</p></p>

        <p>When I'm hiking I smile and say hello to people without masks and will practice trail etiquette.  For people with masks I ignore them and refuse to move out of the way for them, which isn't a problem because they usually jump off the trail in fear when they see someone without a mask.  I know it's petty but I don't have respect for them.</p>

        <p>I hear you - I really do. I HATE the maskS and the related maskholes that come with them. </p>
<p>That said, a lot these people are just HUMAN BEINGS living in FEAR because of a broken system and fear porn by the media. Hell if I watched the news every day I’d probably be in a dark place right now. </p>
<p>If some dick comes up to me and <em>tells</em> me to put on a mask, I will just say no. If it’s an employee of a store, I will ask if it’s their store policy to refuse service without a mask - if they say yes, I will <strong><em>literally</em></strong> put everything down that I have in my hands, irrespective if it’s perishable, and I will walk out. If they say no, I’d probably just continue walking and ask them to call the cops if they’re that worried.  Also, it’s worth noting that you have to be willing to be kicked out of some stores for this if you really want to stick to what you believe. I personally think it’s worth the inconvenience...</p>
<p>But if sheeple really want to wear a mask, I can’t stop them.  And honestly it’s their right to wear one - just like it’s my right to <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> wear one. All I can do is SMILE when I see a person with a mask because I CAN BREATHE and I’m not living my life in FEAR.</p>

        <p>Good for you. I just had my first shopping experience with mandated masks. I specifically went to the grocery store on a Monday in the evening cause I knew it's only high school girls working. They didn't say a word to me. Lots of shoppers in the store. I was the only one without a mask. It felt so dystopia and I didn't even have issues. It took me about 2 minutes in the car to psych myself up first. It felt good to stand behind my beleifs. I think in the future if anyone does try to kick me out I will follow your lead and just drop my entire order out of my arms and walk out.</p>

        <p>Yeah and I try to reiterate that I’m not doing it to cause a scene...at all...  I just want it to be clear that if a store tries to force me to wear a mask, my money is no longer going to be spent at that establishment. </p>
<p>Restaurants are harder because they are in constant fear of being shut down again, so I generally make a half-assed effort to make it to my table with some sort of attempt of a face covering, but I make it enough of a point that it’s all about compliance and RARELY about projecting anyone. </p>
<p>But when it comes to “essential” businesses...nope!  They’re not going to get shut down, so no mask for me.</p>

        <p>About not being sure what to do if someone tries to force you to wear a mask, a general PSA:</p>
<p>Remember that employees are forced, not even necessarily by their employer, but by the government to enforce laws right now at the risk of the business being shut down. Many disagree with all this just as much as you.  If an employee asks you to wear a mask, please just either comply in the most maliciously compliant way possible or leave. Your anger and frustration is real and valid, but better directed elsewhere.</p>

        <p>I appreciate this comment. I work for a grocery store and they make us wear these or we get sent home. My state has made them mandatory for businesses under penalty of fine so it's not my fault and not my store's fault either. I will not be telling customers what to do but seeing comments saying I deserve contempt and hatred for wearing a mask when it is LITERALLY my job and I have 0 choice in the matter are really immature and upsetting.</p>

        <p>I don't live in the US, and I would never classify it as a free country, just look at the amount of tyranny and oppression people are under right now, all in the name of staying safe from a virus as deadly as a flu. Don't matter how many people lose their jobs and end up homeless because they can't pay their rent/mortgage anymore, and how many lives are ruined as a result. Don't matter economies are going in debt, and that suicides and drug overdose related deaths are spiking, or that domestic abuse is rampant. Yeah, let's ruin everybody's lives by locking down society and mandating them to isolate themselves and wear masks all day just so we can save somebody's 90 year old grandma that was going to die of alzheimer's in a couple of months time anyway.</p>

        <p>I don't know what kind of crackpot science you're reading there, but I feel like I need to point out a few things.</p>
<p><em>"The coronavirus' death rate is currently about 5.2 percent, based on the reported totals of cases and deaths."</em> </p>
<p>Is that so? Because back in March WHO came out with the "official" <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/covid-19-s-death-rate-is-higher-than-thought-but-it-should-drop">fatality rate of 3.4%</a>, which of course seemed ridiculous, but not even as much as it is claimed in that article. Later on this month the CDC came out with a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html#box">best estimate of 0.65%</a>, but of course that is dependent on many factors, which could make it even lower, such factors being age, health, pre-existing conditions, and proper care.</p>
<p>First let's look at the fatality rate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_due_to_COVID-19#Mortality_by_age">relative to age</a>, and as you can see, in many countries if you're under the age of 40 it's almost zero percent.</p>
<p>Now let's take a look at a <a href="https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/2184415/air-force-update-for-covid-19/">study done in the Air Force,</a> where most live healthy lifestyles. The highest fatality rate it's ever been there is 0.15%.</p>
<p>So what does that say? Well the fatality rate is very difficult to calculate, and the only way to get accurate results is to test the entire population and account for all other factors that may affect the fatality rate.</p>
<p>Should I even bring up how <a href="https://youtu.be/olz03OPeijM?t=100">cases and deaths are being misreported</a>?</p>
<p>More examples <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/political/florida-man-20s-who-died-motorcycle-wreck-labeled-covid-19-death-state">here</a>, and <a href="http://inproportion2.talkigy.com/cause_of_death_20jul.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Then let's see what some <a href="https://banned.video/watch?id=5ea4994ea881fd00808e95ad">doctors</a> think about this whole situation.</p>
<p>More examples <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVz7hTo1vkw&amp;feature=youtu.be">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Th4tC1YgA">here</a>.</p>

        <p>The fact that you immediately don't understand the difference between CFR (est. 5.2%) and IFR (est. .08%) means you don't have the capability or willingness to go past the surface of this. You probably also think the earth is flat so not worth trying to change your mind.</p>

        <p>Have I completely missed the part where anything about CFR or IFR is mentioned in your article? Because all I see are some statistics taken out of context and not being specific enough. CFR is misleading since it only counts cases, which is when someone gets sick enough to be hospitalized or diagnosed affirmatively by a doctor. IFR accounts for all infections with COVID, which include both asymptomatic and symptomatic infections.</p>

        <p>Every time I see someone quote that article I laugh because I know they didn’t read the studies it quotes. Starting with the first “strand of evidence”:</p>
<p>&rt;    Although no randomized controlled trials (RCT) on the use of masks as source control for SARS-CoV-2 has been pub- lished, a number of studies have attempted to indirectly esti- mate the efficacy of masks. Overall, an evidence review (29) finds "moderate certainty evidence shows that the use of hand- washing plus masks probably reduces the spread of respiratory viruses."</p>
<p>Indirectly estimated. <em>Moderate certainty</em>. Of hand washing. Oh yeah, plus masks. <em>Probably</em> reduces the spread. </p>
<p>Solid evidence there. As long as you wash your hands, because that is the most important thing you can do to protect you from viruses. </p>
<p>Believe whatever evidence makes you feel comfortable. But it’s a good idea to read the studies you quote.</p>

<p>Lots of studies, evolving science, and correlation to reduced spread in places with high-mask usage. Plus, it isn't that big of a deal to wear one. If anything, it improves your freedom by making you less identifiable with facial recognition. Of all of the things to protest, wearing a piece of cloth on your face to possible (likely) reduce the chance of infecting your neighbors? Why???</p>

        <p>Ah the NPR article that actually misquotes the Lancet article, which says:</p>
<p>&rt;    Face mask use could result in a large reduction in risk of infection (n=2647; aOR 0·15, 95% CI 0·07 to 0·34, RD −14·3%, −15·9 to −10·7; low certainty), with stronger associations with N95 or similar respirators compared with disposable surgical masks or similar (eg, reusable 12–16-layer cotton masks; pinteraction=0·090; posterior probability &rt;95%, low certainty).</p>
<p>That’s <em>could result</em> with <em>low certainty</em> even with 12-16 layer cotton masks, not 1-2 layer cloth masks. So basically maybe, or maybe not. </p>
<p>The science isn’t new; it’s many years old. The Lancet article is a meta-analysis of older studies. And correlation is not causation. </p>
<p>I’m not saying not to wear a mask. I’m just saying that if you read the studies you’ll find that science provides little evidence that masks either work or don’t work. That is unfortunate. You would think that by now we would have better evidence.</p>

        <p>I am a Quaker.  Our Quaker Meeting members mostly wear masks. I don't, and they don't like it.</p>
<p>I was sitting in quiet Meeting the other day thinking about George Fox, the guy who was instrumental in starting the Quakers. (Actual name: "Religious Society of the Friends of Truth". Quite a mouthful.)  And what I was thinking about at that moment was Fox's hat.  See, Fox had this idea that no man was superior to any other man. In his day, it was a strict societal requirement that you doff your hat to anyone of superior rank.  He refused. And he kept getting in trouble for it. He wouldn't even do it for the judge when he was in court on trial for heresy, which was fairly often. And so he'd get fined or even jailed for "disrespecting" the judge. In court he'd boldly say that all men are equal in the eyes of God and that he would not make obeisance to any man, only to God. </p>
<p>Some of his friends, and even sympathetic judges sometimes, would say "C'mon, George, just take the hat off. You can still get your message out, just go along with it, and get on with your life. Why make such a big deal out of it?"  And he'd gently reply something to the effect of "you're totally missing the point."</p>
<p>None of the members of my meeting see any similarities to his hat.  I got up in Meeting and spoke about how masks are symbolic obeisance to worldly authorities, but got only blank or annoyed looks. It makes me a little sad.</p>

        <p>This is not heartening to read. I"m not a Quaker or even a Christian but I've been thinking about going to a meeting in Flagstaff, AZ if they still have them.</p>

        <p>It's not really the mask thing that is annoys me, it's more the fact that these clueless lemmings were to ignorant to pay attention to anything going on in the world taking absolutely zero precautions leading up to March then all of a sudden they all became a bunch of militant Covid warriors once the media told them too behave that way. If the media never reported on Covid 19 like a bunch of fear mongering doomers, none of these people would give a shit about masks right now.</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry to hear that. </p>
<p>For your own health, you should know that wearing a mask only provides a tiny bit of protection from others, and wearing one is actually to protect others from particles of water spewing from your mouth. Also unless you're switching or washing the mask every day, and if you're touching it with unsanitized hands, it turns into a Petri dish of bacteria that you'll be constantly breathing in</p>
