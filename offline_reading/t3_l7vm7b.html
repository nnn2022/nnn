        <p>Liquid != Gas though</p>
<p>Liquid is generally (piss is definetly) more viscous than gas which is why the piss would not go much further than the pants (or a mask). So, I understand mask-wearing for those showing symptoms because they should block aerosols and larger infected water/liquid droplets from getting into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Asymptomatic people do not produce anywhere near the same amount of aerosol / droplets so mask wearing is useless (and asymptomatic people barely spread the virus anyway, but that is a different argument). Assuming asymptomatic people are just as likely to spread it than symptomatic people, the air leaving the asymtomatic person's mouth will be moist and will leave through the top of the mask (so yes, the air is redirected so there may be a small benefit), however as soon as that warm, moist air comes into contact with the colder, dryer air in the atmosphere, it will condense and all those infected droplets will land on places like shelves in shops, door handles, and other touching points.</p>
<p>So yeah, in my belief masks would only make a tiny bit of difference to the chances of getting infected, since symptomatic people should be at home anyway, and for that reason (as well as being a libertarian) I am against mandating masks. If people want to wear them because it makes them feel good then go for it, it's not my place to stop you; but the wearing of masks shouldn't be mandatory because it is not anyone else's place to tell me to do something, especially when the percieved benefits are so tiny.</p>

        <p>In war times people would recycle metal for use in the factories. People would collect small amounts of metal to aid in the war effort. Every little thing we can do should be done to save lives. </p>
<p>I understand you want your freedom but would you risk a another person's life for it? Its such a simple easy thing to do. It's like the sign on a store saying no shirt no shoes no service, it's a mask it's not like you're giving someone your kidney.</p>

        <p>I understand this point but I think it is misguided and a small bit paranoid (no offence intended, I'm not trying to attack you personally, I'm attacking the argument).</p>
<p>My main problem with masks is that they are legally mandated, and people who don't want to wear them risk having their lives ruined by being made criminals over the issue.</p>
<p>If I may, I'd like to make an analogy. The same gains in life saving could be made on the roads by reducing the speed limit (in the UK) from 30mph in built-up areas to 20mph, and from 70mph to 60mph on motorways and dual carriageways etc. My argument is, is it worth criminalising (or potentially criminalising) large groups of people (which can ruin lives becauce fixed penalty notices can appear on certain DBS checks, limiting the range of jobs people can have) for the sake of saving a very small amount of lives.</p>
<p>People must be free to take chances, for without risk we would all live in perpetual misery (and I'm not saying masks are a symbol of misery, although it does mean we can't see people's emotions, but that is a personal issue); it is the thinking behind masks that worries me, because you could just as easily say we're going to ban travel during winter because it will save lives (albeit not very many). The same thinking can be applied to bigger, more draconian policies, which do have the potential to make life miserable for the sake of saving a few lives.</p>

        <p>It starts as a fine here in the UK, but because the mandate to wear masks is written in the criminal law, it is enforced by authorities issuing things called Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs). Although paying an FPN does not convict you of a crime, it can still appear on certain Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks, which a lot of employers use to conduct background checks on employees; so they do make you look like a criminal. If you contest the FPN and lose in court, that is when you are convicted as a criminal, and that will show up on all types of DBS checks. Basically, not wearing a mask is the same type of offence as speeding; the record of the offence will be recorded and is disclosable, even if you are not convicted.</p>
<p>That's my problem with masks. I'm not someone who believes it restrics you breathing (obviously depending on the mask, I'm referring to the surgical-type ones) or anything like that, I just believe that is shouldn't be a criminal offence not to wear one.</p>

        <p>These mfrs believe in "The Science?"  More like false idols such as Fauci.  Gimme a break:</p>
<p>When a bum pisses him / herself it doesn't create infectious microdroplets that permeate the air around me... whereas microdroplets are not restricted from leaving or entering the sides, top or bottom of a loose fitting surgical mask, useless cloth mask, going right thru a thin neck gator, etc...</p>
<p>By the standards of the believers in the lord our god, Science, this meme is very out of touch with the data that supports the use of masks.  Yet the sheep and npc's will nod in acceptance and follow the herd.  </p>
<p>The most interesting part about the Science believers imo is that they follow blindly what supposed scientists (and politicians looking to cover their ass) say when mask mandates are based on recommendations... the scientific method has not been used and there are no real conclusions on the efficacy of masks and sars-cov-2, more specifically certain types of masks, the required fit / seal as well as (most recently) the number of masks (really talking about the layers of filtration).  </p>
<p>The whole thing is a virtue signal jerkoff festival to the n'th degree.  </p>
<p>This is not about the virus.  The response to the virus, which I think does exist, has been hijacked for power and social control.  </p>
<p>Religious followers in the west are jumping ship like never before.  Organized religion was the main driver of social control since the times of Christ.  As that control dwindles,  a new control is needed.  </p>

        <p>You see, the molecules in urine are much smaller than the gaps in the denim, so it will just soak through. Not to mention that the urine can drip out the bottom as well, so it doesn’t provide much protection. All you are doing is holding urine soaked pants close to your legs, which is not great. If the pants fall down your waist, you have to pull them back up, and you will get pee on your hands and get it all over everything you touch. It would have been better if they wore no pants at all.</p>

        <p>This is an appropriate analogy to the science.  And the reason why we’ve worn them for years in operating rooms but patients don’t need to.  By wearing them we protect the patients, much more than ourselves.</p>
<p>That said, they don’t need to be work 24/7.  In public places however, I choose to wear them to assist in protecting others.  Eventually, I’ll take it off when the science shows it’s reasonable to do so.  Not yet, however.</p>

        <p>Only one mask? You can't be serious about protecting others with only one mask. A minimum of three or you're a pLAgUe rAT.</p>

        <p>Is 3 masks protection from others or protection for the wearer?  It was my understanding that was protection for the wearer.</p>
<p>The majority of transmission is droplet not aerosols so one mask is effective.  I’m not wearing 3, unreasonable waste of PPE, when I can accomplish what I want to in public with one.</p>
<p>If I had to care for a loved one with the sickness at their home that’s different... 3 is not unreasonable.  If you want to see ludicrous look up what we have to do in donning/doffing ppe for treating covid patients.  It’s a lot, but effective in protecting yourself.</p>
