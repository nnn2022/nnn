    <strong>Negative COVID test after having dinner with double vaccinated family members</strong>
    <p><p>My girlfriend &amp; I are not vaccinated and have no intentions of receiving the experimental vaccine. However, the family members we dined with over the weekend are all double-jabbed and are very pro-vaccine.</p>
<p>We received a phone call yesterday to let us know that the two family members we sat with, C &amp; R, have both tested positive for COVID. We hugged, kissed, and remained in close proximity of C &amp; R the entire time and yet we, the “anti-vaxxers”, have tested negative. We intend to test again soon to ensure accurate results, but I found this quite interesting.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that both C &amp; R have had COVID in the past (prior to vaccination) and were both absolutely fine.</p>
<p>And yet, after all this, the push for widespread mandatory vaccination are still prevalent. Why? Surely I cannot be the only one in a similar position</p>
<p>I have no quarrels with those who wish to take the vaccine and those who refrain. I also do not wish death upon others for their own personal choices. </p>
<p>Stay safe.</p></p>

        <p>I believe it's no fluke that we the unvaccinated are virus free despite mingling with vaccinated and positive carriers, I think we are naturally resistant/immune from this plandemic and that's what worries the authorities.</p>

        <p>I think the problem with the pandemic hoax is, if the virus was as contagious as they claimed, most people already had it after 3 waves. The 4th wave is only from ADE in the vaccinated.</p>

        <p>Stop getting tested. The tests are faulty. This pandemic would end overnight if people stopped getting tested.</p>

<p>&rt;  They note that in COVID-19 survivors, the immune system's antibodies evolve during the first year, becoming more potent and better able to resist new variants. In 32 volunteers who never had COVID-19, they found that antibodies induced by mRNA vaccines did evolve between the first and second shots. But five months later, vaccine-induced antibodies were "equivalent" to those seen after the second dose, with "little measurable improvement" in the antibodies' ability to neutralize a broad variety of new variants  </p>

        <p>To my knowledge, their symptoms have been mild. C was due to start a new job yesterday and because of the nature of C’s work they require weekly testing. This is my reasoning as to why C had taken a test.</p>
