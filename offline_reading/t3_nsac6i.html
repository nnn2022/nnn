    <strong>Is this mess ever going to be over with? How long do they plan to drag it out?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm high risk so in the damned if you do or damned if you don't position. I did go rejoin life more and started going to stores etc but there's still nowhere really to go. As of now I don't feel comfortable rejoining groups of people worried about spike proteins being shedded. I know this is controversial but I know there's a point I am going to have to rejoin life completely despite my fears. I don't plan to get the vaxx and have many issues with it.</p>
<p>What is bothering me, is there seems to be no end to any of this. I am noticing even among the vaxxed, they are still holding off meeting with each other and still holding events outside. Since the vaxx doesn't end transmission and doesn't bring immunity. Well when will all this end? I wonder if some of the vaxxed are getting pissed that regular life has not returned in many places.</p></p>

        <p>Economic collapse and change of governments,  hopefully not for the worse though... often times revolution leads to terror. So yeah, not looking too good.</p>

        <p>Seems to me this has been part of the grand scheme for some time, and is a major part of elites control process. It will go on until its purpose is fulfilled. However I continue to tell people. This can all end as soon as we want it to. We must stop complying and consenting to this tyranny,  and stand up for ourselves.</p>

        <p>I agree with stop complying. I know at a certain point no matter the risk I have to throw down, risk Covid [or spike proteins] and start engaging with people again. I wish I could find groups of people here against all this---I am looking.</p>

        <p>Yes. I continue to ask myself. Was there ever really a " risk". I have never trusted the government or big pharma. If you are teetering between trusting and skeptical. Then I would recomend to look into the actions and lies that both of these organizations have taken part in throughout history. These people who have created panic have not done it for the health or benefit of their fellow countrymen/ humans. They have done it for what they gain in the end. Now don't get me wrong I'm not asking you to blindly follow my word, but I am asking that if you are skeptical then please look into the track record of these people and organizations that demand your loyalty and blind allegiance to them. It shows you what's behind the veil that has been created to pressure people into complying out of fear.</p>

        <p>I wonder too about the "risk"? I know some here believe the virus is a hoax, but I believe something real killed people though more and more I think the PCR tests cooked it up to the max, with every sniffle labled Covid.  We have been lied to about so much. I don't even know if the shedding of spike proteins from the vaxx is real too. Yeah their track record is really bad. Our lives have been destroyed for what? I don't know what to do right now. I can't live like a prisoner with no one to talk to forever.</p>

        <p>Agreed. The truth has been blurred passed the point of recognition. To combat this I have been focusing more on the actions taken not what has been said, because the "truth" as we know it contradicts the actions being taken and the outcome of what is "supposed to be"  being skeptical is the best stance in my opinion at this time, because we can not trust liars and con artist to give us the truth so that we can make a responsible decision for ourselves. Which seems to me that is the plan, the system wants us to trust and follow. Not to make our own decisions. It could have very well all been a hoax, it could have also been bio. Warfare. It could have been a virus to eliminate the elderly. The possibilities are many. We can do our best to put the pieces we have together to come to a reasonable decision, but that could still be off from the truth. All I know is that I have stopped following any and all mandates or guidelines as much as possible since this has begun, and personally the people around me, even my grandparents have not had any health issues during this event. The only thing I have honestly suffered is a loss of liberty.</p>

        <p>So I just got your reply where you wrote "I did notice that my comments are being randomly removed. weird", but when I go try to reply to it I can only see it in your reddit profile. When I go to the actual post where you commented or replied in, your comment is either invisible or just disappeared completely.</p>
<p>Try creating a different account using a different email address, and then open reddit using your paulides_fan account in (for example) Firefox, and your other new account using (for example) Chrome.</p>
<p>What I find is that when using two different web browsers you are able to run some tests to see if you're shadow banned or not. A long time ago I was, but I think after a period of days or weeks the shadow ban wears off. Not sure about that.</p>
<p>Can you tell me what happened when you used your prior account? Did reddit provide a reason why casual_lioness was banned or no-longer active? When I tried searching for you using your old account all I could find was "This account no longer exists". ☹🙁😢</p>
<p>Let me know what happens. For now, I'm going to try a test whereby I "unfriend" you (there was a button to "friend" or "unfriend", so currently I clicked your profile as a "friend"), and let's see if by unfriending you if I'll be able to see your comments/messages in actual posts as opposed to searching for your comments in your profile. Talk to you later, alligator! 🐊</p>

        <p>The cards are falling but the media refuses to cover it. Once it becomes so obvious and the media can no longer cover then it will end.</p>
<p>Although TPTB may try to pull something out if their butt to make this last longer, e.g. a new strain immune to the ‘vaccine’.</p>

        <p>Not sure where you live my friend, but segregation and isolation of the non-vaxxed is not normal, covid passports are not normal either. It's not just about lockdowns and masks.</p>

        <p>I agree with this.</p>
<p>Where I live, no vaccines passports yet (thank god), things are open, concerts are happening, masks are off.  My two biggest hurdles right now are my employer segregating the unvaxxed and looking into legality of forced vaccination, and the ability to travel without a fucking vaccine or PCR test. </p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>I am absolutely shocked with how quickly all these stupid public health orders started unraveling the second the CDC changed its mask guidelines.  For probably the first time in a long time, I have some hope that our side might actually prevail.</p>

        <p>This is a more affluent town. Very few hippies and rebels here on right or left. We have an inner city area that is very poor too. I don't see any actual social lives happening or resuming. Some vaxxed are holding outdoor events like a theatre show. I already am being banned as non-vaxxed person from one group and it is being discussed in another. I told husband I wanted to visit a couple small towns in our county. One is remote enough it may be more "normal". I am getting the feeling other places are more normal. Most businesses here are even requiring masks in general of the vaxxed though I have seen a few less masks.</p>

        <p>When the 'aliens' come to invade. That's when this is over and the next shitty theatrics start. Hopefully the 'aliens' take all the sheep like in Noah's Ark and we get left alone here. Maybe they have been taking everyone's DNA for this very reason. But instead of an ark it's just a spaceship. 😂</p>

        <p>Ultimately, you are really the only one that can return yourself to life. The restrictions are a huge problem in many areas, of course. There isn't going to be an end when they all say "now you're safe!!" But if your fears are also a factor, not just the "rules" then there is no end in sight until you decide there is. Not to be harsh- at all- I get that it can be scary. But if you can, since you don't want to live like this forever, rejoin the world however you can, at whatever pace you can. I had mild covid early on...and technically, I am "high risk"...yet it was still no worse than a bad case of bronchitis with the flu. It sucked, then it was done and I moved on with life. Since then, the only restrictions I have followed are those legally mandated. I've travelled all over the world (to places that allow it), wear a mask only when it is absolutely required and never outside, and if a place is crowded, but I want to go there, I go. I live my life exactly as I did before this started, except for throwing on a single layer crepe thing over my mouth to go into a shop. I post on here to deal with my frustration and anger at the situation, so it doesn't bleed into my life outside of limited internet stuff. I don't discuss vax stuff. If someone is happy to have it, I'm like "yea". If they are worried, I show concern about their feelings. If they ask about my vax status I just go "eh, I'm not into talking about that stuff." and move on. If they don't move on, I respect their boundaries and move on. You can do this if you want to, at your own pace :)</p>
