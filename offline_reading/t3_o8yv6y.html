    <strong>I am exhausted of UK Covid rules and feel like a whiny b***ch for reacheding a breaking point today</strong>
    <p><p>I doubt this will be allowed on r/TrueOffMyChest but I had to vent. I'll be blunt - if you're an anti-vaxxer I'm sorry but I'm not a part of your tribe, but I've reached a point where I can't do another lockdown.  I just had to talk to someone that I hope will understand because I don't think I can talk to anyone in real life about this.</p>
<p>____________</p>
<p>I've been a good girl for 14 months now.</p>
<ul>
<li>I've worked from home.</li>
<li>Didn't leave the house during lockdowns except for grocery shopping.</li>
<li>Wore a mask every.single.time I left the house or used public transport.</li>
<li>Went 4 months at a time without human touch.</li>
<li>I missed my grandma and my uncle's funerals in 2020 because we couldn't travel abroad.</li>
<li>I  cancelled my one and only vacation - Christmas trip up north to  friends' house to spend the holidays together - because the government  imposed another lockdown the day I was supposed to travel.</li>
<li>I registered for a vaccine the day it was offered to my age group.</li>
<li>I haven't seen my family for almost 2 years because they live abroad.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've  done everything I was asked to do. Some of the above I wrote and felt  'meh, it wasn't a big deal and I was happy to do my part'. Other things  on that list simply crushed my fucking soul and wore so much on me  mentally sometimes I think I can't go on like this.</p>
<p>This  is one of those moments where I feel like a little whiny bitch but I  just got back home from my first trip abroad to help my dad for 2 weeks  after a hip surgery and I just can't take it anymore.</p>
<p>I  will take 6 total PCR tests by the time I'm done with this ordeal: 1 to  leave the country, 1 on arrival there, 1 to fly back, and then 3 here  to get out of quarantine. Don't ask me how much those fucking tests  cost. I was happy to wear a mask and sanitize hands and fill out those  'locator' forms on my way back and submit evidence I booked my tests in  the UK in advance.</p>
<p>What  truly got to me today is that I got a phone call from the "track and  trace" program. They called me while I was still asleep, so I didn't  pick up and they followed up with a text message. So I thought "cool,  they are just reiterating the rules to people".</p>
<p>Well,  no. I got a second call and the UK government is actually paying a  whole fucking call center of humans to work weekends and call people on a  recorded line to chastise them about travel and adhering to the rules,  and apparently I need to do another survey.</p>
<p>God  knows this is probably the second time in my life I hang up on someone  mid-call who wasn't a scammer. I just couldn't do it. I'm exhausted.  I've spent the last 2 weeks helping my family. I'm mentally  drained. I have to work tomorrow, and don't want to spend my last  fucking day off before I go back talking to someone about my trip. I  already gave you all the information! Can you please look it up on the  form I've submitted and don't call me early in the morning on a fucking  Sunday! Just leave me alone, please!</p>
<p>I  don't know what it was about today that just broke me, but I'm lonely,  isolated, and tired. Thanks for listening to my rant. Hope you stay  healthy and safe.</p>
<p>P.S. I've made a throwaway for this because I don't want people doxxing my real account. Hope that's not against the rules.</p></p>

        <p>Being ‘good’ at this stage just means you’re complicit in allowing this thing to go on forever.</p>
<p>I love hearing people say ‘if everyone just followed the rules it would be over and things would get back to normal’. In what world would that make it over?</p>
<p>So I think you summed it up pretty nicely with your post. Complying gets us no where fast</p>

        <p>Honey you're going to have to realize that what other people think of you is very low on life's totem pole and start pushing back. Otherwise there will be nothing left of your own spirit and soul. You did great by hanging up. Next time, tell them that they've misdialed or tell them you are your sister. If you must comply, do so maliciously.</p>

        <p>Thank you, love. It was encouraging to hear. I may totally use your excuse if they call again!</p>

<p>I've even specified on the locator form I dont want to be contacted. Apparently that doesn't mean anything. Just a formality, like everything else about it these days.</p>

        <p>I was absolutely not a “good boy” during any of this, traveled and saw people, went to parties, and ignored rules whenever I wanted. Never got sick, no one around me ever got sick, and I still have my mental health at this point. For everyone who talks about how obedient they were this past year: for what? So you can arrive at the same place I have, but with a deteriorated mental state?</p>

        <p>You made your bed now lie in it. This is what being a "good little girl" gets you. I've tried to empathize with people like you but you're willfully ignorant and the tell tale sign is your opening statement "if you're an anti-vaxxer I'm sorry but I'm not part of your tribe".</p>
<p>Imagine if we dehumanized you just like you've done here? Would this even be available for you to rant on since those of your ilk won't allow you to vent on r/Trueoffmychest?</p>
<p>I know you mocked us in the beginning calling us weak because we refused to comply or wear "a tiny piece of cloth". Now look at you, on the verge of loosing it. Now you know what we were fighting for. Now you know we were actually fighting for you and we're still fighting for you and yet you still shun us. </p>
<p>I honestly think we need to ban people that say this type of shit because you don't see us as human. Enjoy your solitude and realize you brought this upon yourself. I feel nothing for you.</p>

        <p>Sorry but no, that's not what I said. I didn't call you a "dumb dumb anti-vax tribe".  I told you about my position because otherwise I'd be intellectually dishonest. </p>

<p>I've done my research, weighted the risks, compared them to the convenience costs (e.g., being unable to travel in the future to see my family) and made my choice. I think it's the right choice as the long-term effects from Covid in my personal view outweigh the risk of a vaccine. But that's me, and you do you.</p>

<p>It should be revealing that you had to make a throwaway account and post on a (somehow not yet officially, but practically) quarantined subreddit.</p>
<p>I think most people here will lend a sympathetic ear rather than do the normal internet thing.</p>
<p>I missed my grandfather's funeral this past year as well. </p>
<p>If you ever want to chat just hit me up. Or probably any of us really. I find it refreshing being brutally honest with internet strangers. Like this age's priests receiving confession.</p>

        <p>Your internal behavior programs obviously say "If I am a good girl things will get better". Not in this case. Time to rethink your programs. This entire mess is a scam. The CDC has actually come out and said only 10 percent of covid deaths were from just covid, all others had 1-3 co-morbilities.  Hospitals were paid per death in the us from covid, 42k a piece. Covid has a lower death rate than the annual flu. </p>
<p>Time to wake the fuck up. Stop complying, do the research, rethink this "my tribe" bullshit or live like this forever. MANY "experts have said covid will never go away.... want this BS forever?  then keep complying and being a "good girl". Time to ovary up sweetheart or shut up.</p>

        <p>There are no tribes. Some of us have taken the vaccine, others are against it and they both have their reasons. Makes it hard to be sympathetic if you dehumanize people based on whether they make their own health choices or not.</p>
