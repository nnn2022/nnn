    <strong>A different way of disarming pro-vaxxers/doomers: brainstorm about your punishments</strong>
    <p><p>You need to start brainstorming with them about new creative ways for the government to punish you (unvaxxed). You can half joking half serious say that you need "bigger punishments" because "rewards won't work". Say you think of it as a challenge to see how long you can hold out (even if in truth you're never gonna take that shit). Obviously many doomers say the government needs to punish you, just to piss you off. If you use this strategy that no longer works.</p>
<p>If you tell them any of the things discussed on the sub they won't believe you anyway, so I feel this is a better strategy. You need to say it a bit like a goof, laid back.</p>
<p>You can talk about Pakistan cutting off cell phone service for the unvaxxed and say you don't care about cell phone service (I mean who needs that shit anymore).  You can say not being able to enter the bar is not good enough punishment. You can say, perhaps cutting me off from my bank account is good enough...? But that will never happen probably. Or "what about getting fired?", I say there's always a shortage in my field so it would be easy for me to find work. Keep thinking of new punishments and why you don't care about them.</p>
<p>This worked for me at my job. Everyone except me has taken it and when I said it like this they actually started laughing. Whenever this comes up now I just say "not enough punishment" and no one really has a rebuttal for that.</p>
<p>Hope this helps someone.</p>

        <p>What often helps is to behave really naive and have them explaining it all to you. What seems like innocent questions makes it harder and harder for them to keep their views logical. It's much like a religion, in the end you just "have to believe it".</p>

        <p>I just ask them to show me "the science" so I can learn and they immediately break down. Sometimes long enough to actually listen to a peer-reviewed medical journal or some statistics which insert the seed of doubt.</p>
