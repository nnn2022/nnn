        <p>Dude, I don't want to sound like a cdc shill or something, but I don't think spreading shit like this around is very constructive. </p>
<p>If you are a healthy individual and feel like covid isn't a threat to your health, don't take the vaccine. You don't need any other reasoning to not take it. I'm not taking it simply because I don't want to take it, as covid is not a risk to me. That is the only rationale I need. There is no need to make my decision based on fear. </p>
<p>If people are so afraid of covid, just shut up and let them take their damn vaccine. Don't try to convince them to not take it. The sooner these doomer morons get their jab, the sooner society can open up. I think it's ridiculous it has come to this, but that's the reality. Once every Karen and grandma Karen is vaccinated, there will be no argument to be made for masks and social dick licking. </p>
<p>So fuck it. If Karen wants to get her jab, I accept her choice. The alternative is that these loons keep everyone triple masked up and socially distanced until Christmas 2022 and beyond. </p>
<p>So in short, let's make the message here be "If you're a doomer, get the vaccine or stfu."</p>

        <p>CDC collusion with drug and vaccine makers was probably never so clear as when the CDC launched the great swine flu massacre on us all in 1976.  Money, as usual, not our health, was the driving force.  Drug companies had produced a vaccine which suspicious pig farmers had refused to use on their own swine.  Because when they did, their pigs collapsed and died. When the swine flu “vaccine” makers (which included Merck, which now makes a shingles vaccine, the horrendous Gardasil HPV Vaccine, and a dubious flu vaccine) failed to secure the $80 million the company had counted on getting from the swine breeders, some bright folks working in government and industry decided to use the vaccine on people instead.  But first they had to convince us the swine flu threat was real.  It wasn’t, so they turned to then President Gerald Ford to sell the disease to the people. (As George Merck once told TIME magazine:  you don’t sell the drug, you sell the disease. The CDC knows that as well as anyone.)
The impetus for the whole swinish project came from the Disease Control Center in Atlanta, Georgia. Out of Atlanta came the CDC plan for a national campaign against “swine flu.” That there was not a single independently confirmed case of swine flu in the U.S. did not deter the CDC.* They had vaccine to sell.  (Theirs was not to question why.)
