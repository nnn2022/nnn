        <p>You have to maintain a sense of humor, things are absurd and ridiculous, hypocritical and nonsensical.  The biggest problem with all of it is that the majority of people have lost their sense of humor, or it has become so warped that laughter and jokes have become so artificial.</p>
<p>Not saying it’s right to laugh at others’ pain, but being able to laugh about hardships is a coping mechanism I think society is being heavily deprived of.  </p>
<p>Fact is there are forces at work that want us angry, sad, depressed, envious, and every other emotion associated with fear.  These emotions contribute to illness of every kind.  They don’t want us to genuinely smile and laugh.</p>
<p>We have to continue to be able to laugh at ourselves, and not in a malicious manner; would say it is ok to blatantly laugh at the psychopaths that have become self-righteous, judgmental, authoritative and have developed some type of superiority-complex though.  Laughter has always gotten me through hard times, you can’t always be so serious.</p>

        <p>The goalposts move as soon as any progress is made. We'll all get vaccinated and then they will say that we can still transmit it so lockdowns will continue, cases will fall  eventually and they will say we need to lockdown again to make cases go down faster. Every health ailment from now on will be ascribed to "long covid".</p>

        <p>I kind of agree. People throw around the term narcissist lightly, but my mom was a for-real, full-out narcissist when I was growing up. She used all kinds of emotionally manipulative tactics to try and control my perceptions and opinions. She really needed to control her environment to feel safe/comfortable, and narcissists see other people as part of the environment, not other individuals with unique wants and needs. </p>
<p>When I see really intelligent people being pro lockdown, and I know many, I wonder if the difference between me and them is their lack of experience with realizing someone you trust and who seems good/like they have your best interests at heart (in my case, my own mother— in the case of pro-lockdowners, seemingly well-meaning doctors and scientists being quoted and interviewed in the media) can actually mislead and deceive you on purpose (in my opinion, it’s only so nefarious as public figures playing CYA, but I think reasonable minds can differ on that point). </p>
<p>I think for a lot of people, one fundamental reason they are still on the lockdown train is because they believe experts/politicians are well-meaning and wouldn’t be making a big deal out of covid if it wasn’t worth making a big deal out of. This underlying belief allows people to rationalize away any incongruities they see. I thought the same thing about the main stream media when they were screaming Trump was a Russian agent. I fully believed the old saying “where there is smoke, there’s fire.” Nope. Turns out that reporting that there is smoke is profitable, and there does not even need to be any smoke for people to believe it (because who has the time to independently verify everything they see online? Me included). </p>
<p>My own mom treated me badly, so my expectations for most random strangers are astronomically low, let alone for politicians in power who are trying to justify their performance at work to their bosses (i.e., the vocal Twitter mob they think represents the voters). I’ve seen it happen so often in my professional life on a smaller scale, so I can easily imagine how much worse it could be on the world stage when the public believes your actions have the ability to stop death. It doesn’t even require believing politicians are evil people to buy this theory.</p>

        <p>Yep, I left a small cult-like religious group in October of 2019, and I see the parallels too. I did a lot of research on cults right before leaving, and I often think about this Covid scare in light of that information. It's very telling.</p>

        <p>I was excited about the vaccine. Im not going to take as im pretty sure I've had covid. But now with the new strain in the UK, still have to mask/distance after the shot stories coming out? I'm pretty sure we are in this for a much longer haul than anticipated. </p>

        <p>Instead of focusing on what is uncertain and the negative doomers, I am trying to spend more time connecting with other like minded individuals and doing my part to resist. I am searching for communities and researching what its like to live in a rural area or completely off-grid. Don't let them make you miserable and give up because then they have won.</p>

        <p>Even the smallest amount of research about the glorious "vaccines" will unearth many very disturbing questions. Nurses I know are saying that vaccines take over 7 years to develop and this whole thing seems very dodgy. Many say they will not take it. Also, if it's so safe, why can't you sue for adverse reactions from their wonderful concoctions? Of course, Pig Pharma have never lied in the past either... <a href="https://soundcloud.com/getout_mc/scary-vaccine">https://soundcloud.com/getout_mc/scary-vaccine</a></p>

        <p>One thing I'm optimistic about is recent CDC guidance for pcr labs to lower the amount of cycles. This will make cases drop dramatically and all the normies that didn't wake up will believe the vaccines worked and things can return to "normal" </p>
<p>The global forces don't want to ruin all the brainwashing  they've inflicted on the public for the last 9 months.  By having it go for too long that everyone actually wakes up would mean they couldnt as easily come up with a covid-23 few years from now.</p>
