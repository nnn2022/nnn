    <strong>So now that freedom &amp; all the good parts about being a human are dead &amp; the technocracy has won, what do we do?</strong>
    <p><p>I mean, I try to go outside &amp; talk to people every day. But everyone I know IRL is too far gone, with everything dominated by the phantom virus. I try to improve myself, but it all seems pointless. Everywhere we go, we’re cornered. Talk about what really needs to be done to these elites or expose them? You get deplatformed, if not disappeared, &amp; I wouldn’t be surprised if outright concentration camps become a thing for anyone who even dissents an iota outside of ever-shifting mainstream thought. Try to gather? You get arrested. Try to set up a free society outside the system? You live in brutish, nasty conditions before getting Waco’d. You think different? Everyone hates you, you’re blacklisted from employment, &amp; you’re made to suffer as long as possible as you continually get doxxed &amp; harassed, with it being unchallenged because it’s supported &amp; encouraged by TPTB. Run away? Only a matter of time before the elites find you, &amp; then send massive hordes of NPC’s/drones to your hiding spot to kill you. Oh yeah, &amp; all of these fellow homo sapiens LOVE... LOVE torturing the rest of us because it feeds on their bullying instinct.</p>
<p>What hurts the most is knowing I will be denied the experiences that have made billions of lives before me worth it: falling in love, crazy adventures with friends, traveling the world, seeing new places, or even just enjoying a simple car ride together. It hurts knowing I can’t defend myself from all this shit, &amp; if I tried, it would be too little, too late. The elites have a monopoly on literally EVERYTHING.</p>
<p>So now that it’s become obvious that we’ve been blown the fuck out, &amp; any resistance attempt would be completely crushed, what do we do? We can’t run away or fight back, &amp; fawning won’t work because cancel culture &amp; people have no respect for anyone other than the supreme sociopathic POS overlord. I want my life to be more than just a short, miserable, brutal, loveless, soulless struggle against the zombies that dominate our world.</p></p>

        <p>If it helps any, most people were mindless, MSM-gobbling zombies before 2020 too. Life's been a fundamentally lonely experience for me because of it. It's just more obvious now.</p>

        <p>Even then, you would think that given the self-proclaimed standards of Western society, at some point, things would’ve gotten so crazy they would’ve questioned it &amp; woken up. But no.</p>
<p>I used to read about, but never truly understand why stuff like Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, North Korea, &amp; CCP China happened &amp; why people just didn’t rise up against it or call it out for the bullshit it was. Now I do because I have lived experience of it.</p>
<p>Most people, unfortunately, are followers that will just side with the winning team. That’s what people ignore because they’re too afraid to confront it because confronting it means deplatforming: we just have to be the winning team. Unfortunately, we didn’t talk about winning enough when we still had a chance to win.</p>
<p>I used to be an MSM-gobbling zombie too when I was too young to understand shit. I’m old enough, &amp; have enough computer experience to remember the uncensored internet (OG YouTube, MySpace, Limewire, MSN, Xbox Live in its heyday). But as I got older, I saw &amp; experienced things.</p>
<p>I remember being 5 years old right after 9/11 &amp; watching Iraq like “Yay! America! Get those dirty terrorists!” (I was FIVE, do not judge me). It terrifies me to think about what I’d be like if I were 5-6 years old now, or had I not red pilled myself.</p>

        <p>I was lucky enough to spend my teenage years on message boards and MMOs. Never created accounts on nonanonymous social media platforms because I saw them for what they were. I watched the commodification of human relationships in real time, from friend count competitions on FB to Tinder swipe culture. </p>
<p>There's nothing any of us could've done to stop big tech. They played on our weaknesses and cognitive biases. They leveraged their financial power to the point where they're now melded with most governments. They control what we can read, see, and say, and they coordinate. I've known for a long time that they're our de facto rulers, but as Zappa said it, they pulled back the curtains and it's no longer speculative.</p>

        <p>All we can do is disengage. Obey love, not the law. Learn skills and share them with others. The more you can provide for others that they'd otherwise have to turn to the state or a large corporation for, the better. Do not co-operate with authorities unless compelled. Do not escalate your troubles with authorities; it only invites more authority. Do not inform authorities (meaning do not allow cookies or tracking and use a non-Five Eyes VPN). Grow seeds; mend clothes; shop locally (cash or barter); invest ethically; tip well; praise often; encourage, support, and listen. Be what government dares not be, and do what government dares not do, especially among the down-and-outs.</p>

<p>Those things were valuable distractions from the coming of the domination we now face, but they aren't what gives life meaning: virtue gives life meaning. The extent to which you maintain your principles in the face of external threat, past the point of 'rational self-interest,' is the extent to which you exist as far as outside forces need think. Besides, there is no guarantee the monopolists have won. They are human; they are mortal. They remain capable of snatching defeat out of the jaws of victory, as millions have done before - through sheer, unbridled greed and egoism.</p>

        <p>The distractions would’ve been nice, &amp; I don’t see a way the monopolists are going to lose because I feel like they have all scenarios covered.</p>
<p>That said, love your practical advice. Will implement.</p>

        <p>I'm starting by doing small acts of rebellion and positivity every day.</p>
<p>Remember, I was HEAVILY brainwashed by the mainstream media and social media in March 2020 when I was still in NYC.</p>
<p>My first step was walking outside the apartment without a mask for the first time in months.  I said to myself, "You are a human, not a disease vector."  There was a man smoking outside the door.  I told myself, "he is also a human, not a disease vector."  I never thought I'd say this, but the winter air on my naked face felt amazing!</p>
<p>Now I start every day by writing a positive, rebellious statement on a sticker and putting it where I see it in my work from home space.  Things like "Emancipate yourself from mental slavery" or "We have nothing to fear but fear itself."</p>
<p>I make a point of smiling at people and engaging them in conversation like none of this ever happened.</p>
<p>Sometimes you have to start with the little things and work up from there.</p>

        <p>Don't worry about deplatforming. Just don't use the big tech platforms that do it. Make a personal site, or even talk to people in real life. That's much more meaningful too and we should have done that more before the scamdemic.</p>
