    <strong>My Story</strong>
    <p><p>It was February 2020. At an appointment with my therapist she asked if I would be okay with over the phone visits, if this coronavirus situation over in China became a serious issue. I laughed. "Do you really think that'll happen? There's no way it'll be that big of a deal,"  I said. Even though I do have generalized anxiety/panic disorder and I literally worry about pretty much everything, I wasn't worried about this at all.</p>
<p>March 2020. My siblings and cousin had tickets to go to see Louis Ck. I almost didn't go because I had started to be afraid of covid, but I did go. And I'm really glad I went because not only was it hilarious but it was the day before the lockdown began and it would be the last time I experienced the Old Normal as we knew it.</p>
<p>The lockdowns began. I was seeing the news and I believed it ~ the bodies dropping on the streets, the maps with the little red dots spreading across the country (I live in the United States btw), the stories about shipping containers being packed full of dead bodies because there was no space for them. I thought this was a literal plague and that hundreds of millions of people were going to die. I was terrified. I had panic attacks, I've always had anxiety but since they said covid attacked your lungs I was convinced that it was covid.</p>
<p>I was convinced that this must be a super realistic nightmare and that I just had to wake up. But I couldn't. </p>
<p>For the next couple of months I sanitized all my groceries, I checked my temperature constantly, I checked my oxygen levels, I called the covid hotlines a lot thinking I had it. I was living by myself at the time, which made all of this so much scarier for me. Once I was sure I had it and I went to the E.R. twice in one weekend. I got X Rays of my lungs and a covid test and everything. Everything was normal.</p>
<p>June 2020. I started to realize that everyone around me was absolutely fine and healthy and so was I. Somewhere around this time the BLM riots began and that was when I was sure that covid was nothing to worry about. AND that was when I realized that something weird was going on. The media was praising BLM, an organization which I already KNEW was not at ALL what it claims to be, for these riots, while also telling us that we couldn't go to concerts or shows or have large gatherings of people. Not only were they praising them but they were saying thay that somehow HELPED the covid situation. That was when I started to realize that this wasn't about a virus. I became more suspicious of the government. But I had other things going on in my life, and I couldn't have honestly imagined at the time how deep this really went, so I focused on other things for a while.</p>
<p>November 2020, the U.S. election. The country felt like it changed completely in the days between voting and the announcement of who our President was. The FEELING of living in this country changed for me. I kept seeing the little notifications on posts and YouTube videos saying that Joe Biden was president, just like the notifications about Covid 19 being a serious health issue and I thought, who are they trying so hard to convince? And why does it seem like we suddenly can't question either of these things? </p>
<p>Now I know that the ominous feeling I had was the feeling of the freedom that I had always taken completely for granted slowly disappearing. </p>
<p>(I remember once, on a night in December 2019 when life was still normal, laying in bed and thinking about some things I had learned recently. I had just discovered Jordan Peterson and I was instantly a fan, I thought and still think he's one of the most important people of our time. He made the ongoing culture wars finally make sense to me. I learned about what happened in Soviet Russia, something which I had never learned in school. I saw the connections and how the way our society currently was, was becoming dangerous. But I still thought nothing like that could happen in our lifetime. 
I really thought for the first time about how lucky I was to live somewhere where I was relatively free. And I imagined how scary it would be if I didn't. I remember going to sleep that night comforted by the idea that that would probably never happen. )</p>
<p>January 2021 is where things went off the rails. Because that was when I finally started to look at the conspiracy theories. And I learned about the Great Reset and all of that. And that was when the big picture came into focus and I realized exactly what was happening. I couldn't believe this was real. The "insurrection" happened and I went to the hospital for an Ativan because I was so scared, and even at the hospital there were people talking about the book of revelations and the end times. </p>
<p>I was back to where I was in March 2020, where I thought that maybe the entire past year was just some INSANELY realistic nightmare and that I HAD to wake up eventually. Several times I've also wondered whether I might actually be schizophrenic and am just hallucinating ALL of this. Because this Great Reset can't be real.</p>
<p>But it clearly is real. I still can't believe how many people there are who think this is about a virus.</p>
<p>February to July I ignored the news and reddit completely. I couldn't take it anymore and I had to live my life. Restrictions lifted here, barely anyone wears masks, so things have seemed pretty normal for the past few months. I thought maybe this isn't so bad after all, maybe the Great Reset will take longer than I thought. My most comforting thought was,, Maybe this is like 9/11 and they'll just change some things but that it won't be all of a sudden. Maybe we have a FEW years left at least.</p>
<p>Until of course I checked Reddit last week because I was curious and wanted an update on what's going on around the world. And now I'm terrified again because I see all the propaganda, the media isn't even TRYING to sound credible anymore because they know people are too brainwashed to care, the new vaccine passports, the scary adverse reactions to the vaccine, all the people who want unvaccinated people to die for being "so selfish", etc. Among many other disturbing things happening. And I see that this is all really still happening and that this time of things being normal where I live is not going to last for much longer. I know that the only reason things are normal in the US for now is because we have so many guns.</p>
<p>I don't see how anyone could possibly stop what's happening and I'm scared. I've been trying to brace myself for what's coming as much as possible.</p>
<p>I don't know what to do. Idk if anyone will read all of this. I honestly wrote it because I'm suicidal and panicking and taking the time to write it has allowed me to have a false sense of calm for at least a little while, because I imagine someone out there will read it and maybe say something comforting, or at least they'll know they haven't been alone through this. Thank you for taking the time to read this if you did ♡</p></p>

        <p>To expand, I believe this is a spiritual war. They are trying to break our will. It is coming from all angles, the fear is what causes us to be weak. It is only when you let go of the fear that you can gain the strength to rise up.</p>

        <p>Times are hard but try to have hope. I’m not here to push my agenda but talking to God and asking him to calm your fears helps me. In the end, good always wins. Look at all the protests across the globe. You are not alone. I’m in the US as well. There are many of us ready to fight if we need to. I pray every day for God to give me the courage to stand up against evil and do what is right, whatever that may be.</p>

        <p>This comment is right. Find Jesus Christ. Read about him and his salvation in a Bible, in the gospels of John, Luke, Matthew, and Mark. </p>
<p>You mentioned the book of Revelation. Here are the first three verses:</p>
<p>The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants what must soon take place; he made it known by sending his angel to his servant John, who testified to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, even to all that he saw. Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of the prophecy, and blessed are those who hear and who keep what is written in it; for the time is near.
Revelation 1:1‭-‬3 NRSV
https://bible.com/bible/2016/rev.1.1-3.NRSV</p>
<p>God gave this revelation to warn us of what is coming. He warns us over and over that "he who endures to the end" will be saved. That can be enduring until the Lord's return, or until a natural death, or until martyrdom, while keeping the faith in Christ. Don't give up! Give your life to him who gave his life for you.</p>

        <p>When people talk about awakening it sounds like a beautiful and liberating thing. It is... but it's also quite painful to swallow that pill, to realize that governments could lie to us on this massive scale, to have your world view entirely shattered. You can't un-take that red pill, but it does get easier. You're in a community that for the most part understands this feeling of being lost quite well. It's a good time to explore yourself and what you want out of a world like this as we're all navigating the same issues side by side. Stay strong and keep your sovereignty; reforming the self outside of our sick and damaged systems takes time. Be patient with yourself, and with the people who aren't quite here yet. These are dark times, but the best is yet to come.</p>

        <p>Sending peaceful thoughts your way. Please hang in with us and don’t harm yourself. I think what you see in the news and on Reddit are both over- amped to try to make a point. Just hold on to your center and ride this out the best you can. There are many people who seem to feel the same way we do. Hopefully we’ll all pull together when the time comes.</p>

        <p>I feel you. I consider myself a problem solver. I see something that doesn't make sense I try to figure out why and make sense of it. I try to see the bigger picture. I can not for the life of me figure out what the hell their end game is here. I know it's not good. I can constantly speculate. But in the end I have no clue. It drives me a little crazy seeing people completely ok with the direction our country is going. Like they are all oblivious to what's really going on. Whatever. I just hope there are still a bunch of us left when it really gets draconian here. Maybe we will have a fighting chance.</p>

        <p>I’ve felt like you this entire time. I have major health anxiety and this is the absolute worst thing that could happen for a person like me. I also have older parents that I see daily so I’ve felt the weight of the world making sure I don’t give them Covid. Any time I start to convince myself that it will all be okay I see the sensationalized news articles about people dying and I’m back to not wanting to leave the house again.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this I said there is no way vaccine passports will happen.</p>
<p>I thought there was no way we could ever be in a pandemic situation because of all the great scientists and technology we have. No I sit back daily and read comment after comment on Reddit by people and “scientists” trying to discredit any early treatment possibilities beyond the vaccines which I think are very dangerous (more so than Covid). I just can’t believe the corruption. </p>
<p>It’s exactly like you said. Every day I tell myself this last year has to just be a bad dream, I have to wake up somehow. But then of course it isn’t. I’m at my wits end also. Being forced to take the vaccine is going to be the cherry on top of all of this. I miss my old life.</p>

        <p>Oh man, I forgot all about the Biden won propaganda! I feel you. Thanks for sharing. I'm glad you're still with us. I personally knew more people that killed themselves during this than died of covid. Freaking, I know more that had bad reaction to the v@x. And it's stupid how things changed in relation to the virus: Things were opening back up before people were vaxxed. Can now use reusable bags. Shake hands. Why? What's changed? You can't answer that without admitting they lied. This isn't as deadly as they made us believe. What you were doing before was BS. No one wants to admit it. Instead they're still propping up fear. They went from, "Everyone is going to get this and 4% will die." to "10 positive cases in the county. Shut everything down!"</p>
<p>Things are pretty much back to normal here too. But things can change fast. And remember, it took years for thing to get as bad as they did before WWII.</p>

        <p>Thank you for sharing. I can relate to so much of what you said. Keep this in mind…you said it yourself…you weren’t scared until you came back online. Fear feeds the beast. Don’t feed it. One other thing…I try to think about this…my grandparents went through quite a lot in their generation…my grandmother is 86 and both of my other grandparents lived into their 90’s. Imagine if they worried themselves sick over everything that happened every day waiting for some terrible thing to happen…they would not have enjoyed the 80-90 plus years they were Blessed with. Also pray to Jesus. It helps tremendously.</p>

        <p>Hi, I read through your entire text. Let me tell you I appreciate the way you put together all those ideas into it, and at times I really felt identified with you.</p>
<p>The Jordan Peterson thing really resonated with me, seeing it as I also discovered his talks right before things got this wild and I felt the same way: we're quite lucky not to live in a world similar to soviet Russia or any other dictatorial state from last century.</p>
<p>You've probably heard it all already from other people here but you're incredibly strong if you've come this whole way. Just today I saw a post saying it's been 500 days since we first went into lockdown, and I almost broke down crying even if I'm not the emotional kind.</p>
<p>This whole situation has really brought us down collectively and I hate what it's done to all of us. None of us asked for this. </p>
<p>Once more, let me emphasize that I appreciate that you told us your story and I'm happy that you find a way to be among us, this seems to be one of the last remaining oasis for open discussion left. </p>
<p>Take care, sending love and support from Spain.</p>

        <p>Here is something I can't understand as well. I commented once but I feel like maybe people on here may grasp this hypocrisy. My grandparents got vaccinated. My parents got vaccinated to see my grandparents. Which makes no sense. I asked my parents, you got vaccinated to see your parents because you didn't want to be the reason they got covid and died because of you. Nobel. I respect that. But you didn't get the whooping cough vaccine to visit my kids or your other grand babies in the hospital when they were born. Did you not care you might kill your grand babies in the hospital? They couldn't answer. I said you know why? Because the news isn't constantly telling you that you might kill babies so you didn't care. I didn't care if you didn't have the whooping couch vaccine because I'm not that anal about that crap. But the danger is there. Just as much as it would be to give covid to your parents. So what's the difference?</p>

        <p>I've walked a fine line between the fringes of the rabbit hole for a long time. I often try very hard to stop myself in over-engaging in it, as misinformation/disinformation is a real thing and you have to be careful. Over time, you will get desensitized to the negativity, doom and gloom of knowing what 'the man behind the curtain' is up to.  </p>
<p>At the end of the day, you are responsible for your own happiness, and your mindset can be a blank canvas to paint as you choose. Stay positive, and remember that humanity often must learn the hard way before it sees the light.</p>
