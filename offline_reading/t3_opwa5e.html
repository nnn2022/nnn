    <strong>I think it's time to stop fighting and just get over all this once and for all</strong>
    <p><p>I think everyone, whether you are, let's say, of the pro-lockdown/injection persuasion or not. It's time to let this energy settle because it feels like it needs a lot less energy put into it, and that's what's keeping these feuds a love.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Continue to shine your light on this energy (the things going on with coronavirus, the shots, the government, etc) and remain aware, but one should consider how much energy is going into this, and maybe even the skeptics are keeping this whole thing alove.</p>
<p>You could hypothesise why e.g.: it's contributing to divide and conquer strategies, it allows companies to virtue signal longer, it allows politicians to draw clear lines in the sand with encumbants so that they can pander to them, etc.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's time to let this issue die.</p>
<p>Continue to shine your light on it, but I feel like some people of all eprsuasions are afraid to let this die because it's one of the only things they have in life and they're afraid of what life has in store for them after this tremendous time of change (for better or worse) in humanity.</p>
<p>They're afraid of what comes next.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Don't be afraid to unplug from this issue and live your life how you feels best serves you going on.</p>
<p>Others will follow.</p></p>

        <p>I wish I could take a break, but I can’t. I’m trapped in my house by law because of a new strain of the flu which has a scary name and a 99% survival rate. I’m young and want to live my life. I’m fine with the majority of the world being naive sheep but when it starts to affect my life how can I just sit back and ignore it?</p>

        <p>I feel the same. I get so angry and frustrated by the bullshit on the news. And also the bullshit coming out of people’s mouths that I know, like my husband who thinks vaccine passports are fine because he wants to go on holiday or go to the pub. And my in laws who wants to go to France. I don’t want to live in a world like that and I don’t want to raise my child in it. I feel like I need to keep resisting and fighting it for her. I didn’t spend nine months creating her perfect body to then inject shit into it to allow her some “freedom”. Fuck that.</p>

        <p>You bring up some really good points. I was actually just thinking about this today - I spend way too much time glued to Reddit venting my anger and catastrophizing about worst case scenarios. I’m terrified of being forced to get the vaccine at some point. It just feels really evil to me.</p>
<p>But in a way, that makes me no different than a doomer who obsessively follows covid news and is constantly worried about catching it. I’ve pretty much become a “reverse doomer.”</p>
<p>I think our side does have a shitload more validity and logic to it and I really appreciate people fighting the good fight but sometimes I feel like I’m in too deep and I just want to ignore the whole thing and avoid even acknowledging it’s existence unless it comes up.</p>
<p>I have always been someone who hyperfocuses, it’s just how my brain works but I really think hyperfocusing on this combined with underlying anxiety is not doing my mental health any favors.</p>
<p>This is just me though. I’m still pissed as fuck about how everything went down, but aside from some people still wearing masks (which I could give a fuck about) things are pretty much back to normal where I live. I fully understand not everyone is so fortunate and that really bothers me but sometimes I feel like i would be better off if I stopped obsessing over this sub and the bullshit news and just lived my life.</p>

        <p>Same. I think it’s important to take a break for your own mental health. I have found that I need to step away from Reddit and just try to enjoy the real world.</p>

        <p>It's a good reminder to unplug in general. Last summer when this Covid crap was ragging with BLM and rioting I started getting glued on here to all of the theories and all of the complaining. It's just the opposite side of a doomer. Taking a step back and only visiting or posting once a week or even less has been great for my stress levels and been ultimately freeing.</p>
<p>I still live in a heavily restricted world and I'm still pessimistic about the future overreaction to this pandemic, but either way I'm preparing more for SHTF, enjoying more time with my hobbies, and serving my family, church and community when they need it the most.</p>
