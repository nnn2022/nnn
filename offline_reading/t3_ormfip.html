        <p>Sweden, of course, was maligned in 2020 for foregoing a strict lockdown. The Guardian called its approach “a catastrophe” in the making, while CBS News said Sweden had become “an example of how not to handle COVID-19.”</p>
<p>Despite these criticisms, Sweden’s laissez-faire approach to the pandemic continues today. In contrast to its European neighbors, Sweden is welcoming tourists. Businesses and schools are open with almost no restrictions. And as far as masks are concerned, not only is there no mandate in place, Swedish health officials are not even recommending them.</p>
<p>What are the results of Sweden’s much-derided laissez-faire policy? Data show the 7-day rolling average for COVID deaths yesterday was zero (see below). As in nada. And it’s been at zero for about a week now.</p>

        <p>Thank god for Anders Tegnell. He has been the only head epidemiologist/infectious disease expert in power that has had his head screwed on right during all of this. Simply by following the already established pandemic response guidelines. </p>
<p>I think this BS with restrictions at restaurants etc was all political pressure and not his suggestion. He was even "caught" in the train without a mask because he knows they don't do anything.</p>
