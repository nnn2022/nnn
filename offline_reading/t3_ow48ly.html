        <p>Which is probably what every government signs with Pfizer here is some details concerning the very document mentionned in an article ----&rt;</p>
<p>▪︎ The alleged document states that the purchaser acknowledges the long-term effects and efficacy of the vaccine are not currently known and that there may be adverse effects of the vaccine that are not currently known. So even if the vaccine leads to some problems, the purchaser cannot sue the company, what a noble act!</p>
<p>▪︎ It states that the purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Pfizer, BioNTech (and) their affiliates from and against any and all suits, claims, actions, demands, losses, damages, liabilities, settlements, penalties, fines, costs and expenses. So the purchaser state has been made responsible to save this big pharma company, against the complaints of its own citizens. </p>
<p>▪︎it not only covers the manufacturing of vaccines for COVID19 and its mutations, but also for “any device, technology, or product used in the administration of or to enhance the use or effect of, such vaccine”. So here vaccine is used as an umbrella term for everything related to vaccines under the sun. The alleged vaccine agreement does not allow signatory countries to escape their contract, which states that even if a drug will be found to treat COVID19 the contract cannot be voided. This is the reason why many governments were not enthusiastic about employing Ivermectin, given it would have only added to the cost.</p>
<p>▪︎Pfizer being more concerned about maximising profit rather than using its resources for the betterment of the people. The alleged vaccine agreement goes on to say, while Pfizer shall not be liable to the failure to deliver doses in accordance with est delivery dates, it will have the power to decide on necessary adjustments to the number of contracted doses and delivery schedule due to the purchaser based on principles to be determined by Pfizer and the purchaser shall be deemed to agree to any revision, decided by Pfizer.</p>
