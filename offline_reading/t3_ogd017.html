    <strong>I’m terrified of going back to college.</strong>
    <p><p>This first year screwed me over so bad. I hate talking about it. The college transition is always rough for some people, it’s a given, but this “new normal” turned it into a legitimately traumatizing experience.</p>
<p>When I think about going back to campus, I think of the days and weeks I spent cooped up in that miserable little dorm room. There were no classes in person, the dining hall was always dead-empty. I thank God that the university finally gave me a roommate - without her present, I think there’s a very real chance I would’ve gone off the deep end.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the both of us, the university isn’t requiring vaccines! We’re on the same page, and we both would’ve transferred to a different school without hesitation if they’d required vaccines.</p>
<p>No, instead, there’s a <em>voluntary</em> vaccine roster for students to submit their personal medical records. These golden kids with their names on the VIP list won’t have to be tested every week, and they’ll be winning money from the university. I can already foresee other privileges they’ll be implementing/taking away, this is just as much of the plan as they’ve announced to the public.</p>
<p>I’m scared that they’re gonna make life miserable for us that won’t be on the list. My worst fear is having to spend another 9 months hunched over my computer and failing online “classes” just because the university decided it was somehow safer. I can’t handle another semester like that.</p>
<p>I don’t want to live in the new normal.</p></p>

        <p>Honestly don’t worry because by the time September comes all those on the vip list will be vaccine injured.  Go read r/covidvaccinated it’s a horror show.  Eventually even the media will have to admit it it’s so bad</p>

        <p>I tried to look at that sub. Every time I tried to read a post, it just showed me a post about what to expect after the covid vaccine. Is that happening to anyone else or is something wrong on my end?</p>

        <p>It's really wrong what's happening to young people right now; I obviously don't need to tell you that. Keep being courageous and fighting the good fight. You'll be stronger for it in the end, even if it seems like that "end" is so far away.</p>

        <p>We are society, though. We can’t just sit and wait for other people to start pushing- we’ve gotta make an active effort to be the change we want to see. I don’t disagree with you at all though, “wait it out” can totally be interpreted as “have optimism and hope for the future”, I’m just so frustrated with everything rn and tired of personally sitting around and waiting for things to get better</p>

        <p>I get you. Now, I personaly started university in October 2019 and at least had five normal months (which were the best months of my life, and it will probably stay that way). Then I somehow managed the first lockdown, without too much problems. But this second one took a toll on me. It just went downhill in late november and I had some very bad days in December, especially in the second half, which culminated in a near nervous breakdown on 31 December. Even in the last two months when I am able to be in the dorm, I still feel empty - dont know how to describe it. I cant imagine how bad it would be if I started University in 2020.</p>
<p>I just hope that we wont have lockdowns this year (or any forced vaccinations). Good luck to you too...</p>

        <p>I’m so sorry to hear about what you’ve been through! I’m glad you at least had those five good months, but that’s just so sad knowing that that’s what you’re being deprived of. The first lockdown went well for me too, just finishing out high school - everyone moaned about not having a senior prom, but life was still okay. It was later in the year, like you said, when everything began to take its toll and go downhill. It’s just so sad. I really, really hope that things will start to look up for you, and for all of us students</p>
