    <strong>The problem with this sub</strong>
    <p><p>The problem with this sub is... I literally forget that there are ppl still afraid of covid. I don’t watch MSM and don’t really about it, so when I interact with someone still afraid of the virus (not super common in Georgia, ppl wear masks but don’t really care) I just can’t believe that this is still a thing. I got covid a couple months ago, and it was no different than any time I’ve been sick (one day fever didn’t feel great for like 1.5 days). I get it if immunocompromised ppl are scared but like healthy ppl wtf are u doing to your life</p></p>

        <p>I may have too. I had a few days of stuffy nose and mild sore throat, then shortly after that lost all smell and taste except basic sour/sweet/etc. for three more days. The only difference between strawberry and vanilla I could taste was that strawberry was a little sour.</p>
<p>I was home from work anyway due to minor outpatient surgery and had to postpone it until the next week just outside the 10-day window for other reasons, so I didn't bother getting tested. Still, that matched my dad's symptoms almost exactly and he did have a positive test. I've never had smell disappear completely like that. Sometimes it's dulled when I have a stuffy nose, but totally gone and when it's <em>not</em> stuffed up is weird.</p>
<p>Debating with myself whether I should get an antigen test. I'm not going to do anything different either way but if it's positive then I'd have better verbal ammo when asked "But why don't you want the [rushed, badly tested, sketchy] vaccine?"</p>

        <p>I get where you are coming from. In the western part of ND it is the same way. If there were no TVs we wouldn’t have even known there was a pandemic worthy of shutting down the local businesses. On the eastern side of the state it is basically little Minneapolis. There are groups all for the big government control and and others trying to get their lives back. A lot messier over there.</p>

        <p>My feelings exactly, my parents are super scared of the virus (60+) but also are very anti lockdowns. My dad basically locks himself in his house but they enjoy quality time together. I visit them because they believe in anti bodies. He always says to me when I post pics of me going out and stuff “go live your life man”, I’m hoping people that are scared of the virus start transitioning to this mentality because they can’t control all heathy people who are just done with this.</p>

        <p>Oh tell me about it. </p>
<p>I used to only subscribe to here and other sensible subs, but lately I always check out the stupid subs (like the main ones) to see how more ‘normal’ people are reacting.</p>
<p>And it’s depressing as fuck.</p>
<p>Not as depressing, though, as when I see a message on a WhatsApp group from some normie ‘friends’.  I’ve stopped engaging with them, but I read the posts.</p>
<p>Today went like this:</p>
<p>Guy A “I’m getting my vax today woohoo 🥰🥳🎈🎂🎊🤠”</p>
<p>Guy B “That’s totally awesome duuuude, so happy for you. Hopefully I’ll be getting mine next week, CANT WAIT! 👏👏👏”</p>
<p>Guy C “Props dude! Good luck. I had mine the other week. Felt like proper shit for a couple of weeks but I liked it cos you can feel it’s working”</p>
<p>Guy A “Thanks guys! 🥰🤗🥰💛🥰 Hope it doesn’t mess with my DNA lol, lol, lollity pops”</p>
<p>Guy B “Tee hee LOLZ 🤾🏋️‍♀️🪀🌞🌝🌼”</p>
<p>I’m done with them all.</p>

        <p>Ye I wouldn’t be surprised if you have covid, but I was in a house where everyone had different symptoms. Some had aches, shivers, literally so little energy they couldn’t get up, but also just a stuffy nose and loss of taste, just depends on how the virus attacks you I guess</p>

        <p>I believe people don't want to go out in order to reduce the spread of the virus to others around them. Even if someone healthy gets sick and can fight it off or is asymptomatic, they could pass it onto someone else who is immunocompromised and could die for getting it. For example, if you live with someone older, or you go to the grocery store and spread it to someone else who is immunocompromised but needs to get food to survive. I'm glad that my true president Trump is saying that we should wear masks and be socially distant because he actually cares about us</p>
