    <strong>This data shows that Joe Rogan is right on not getting the vaccine if you're young</strong>
    <p><p>According to the analysis of European pharmacovigilance data by a collective of independent researchers <strong>the suspected case fatality rate for Covid-19 vaccine in 18-44 year olds is identical to the Covid-19 case fatality rate for Pfizer and Astrazeneca vaccines, and even higher by a factor of 7 for Moderna vaccine.</strong> Here is the translated article: <a href="https://reinfocovid.fr/science/effets-indesirables-en-europe-sur-les-vaccins-covid-19-pfizer-moderna-et-astrazeneca/">https://reinfocovid.fr/science/effets-indesirables-en-europe-sur-les-vaccins-covid-19-pfizer-moderna-et-astrazeneca/</a></p>
<p>&rt;ADVERSE EFFECTS IN EUROPE ON COVID-19 PFIZER, MODERNA AND ASTRAZENECA VACCINES<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;April 17, 2021<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;By: The Reinfocovid Collective<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Analysis of adverse events of Covid-19 vaccines conducted between January 1 and April 6, 2021 from the official website linked to the European Commission <a href="https://ADReports.eu">ADReports.eu</a>. It shows<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;a very high proportion of serious effects linked to the Covid-19 vaccines compared to the classical flu vaccine (inactivated virus) on the year 2020<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;a very worrying proportion of sudden deaths by its value and by the fact that these sudden deaths in less than 24 hours post-vaccination affect all age groups.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Adverse reactions in Europe to Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Important points to note<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The suspected case fatality rate for Covid-19 vaccine in 18-44 year olds is identical to the Covid-19 case fatality rate for Pfizer and Astrazeneca vaccines, and even higher (Table 1) by a factor of 7 for Moderna vaccine.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;There are 60 times more suspected deaths after vaccination with Pfizer and AstaZeneca vaccines than after vaccination with the influenza vaccine.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;There are 400 times more suspicious deaths after vaccination with Moderna vaccine than after vaccination with the flu vaccine.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The risk of sudden death is 20 to 60 times higher after Covid-19 vaccination compared to influenza vaccination.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Analysis of Covid-19 vaccine adverse events from January 01, 2021 to April 06, 2021<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Transparent information about new generation vaccines, disruptive technologies at that, is a fundamental right. We are talking about intramuscular injections of highly bioactive substances, so concern is legitimate and researching pharmacovigilance data is part of a process of personal and citizen responsibility.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The concern is based in particular on the fact of the use of genetic engineering involving for the first time in the history of medicine, and directly for mass planetary use, vaccines with messenger RNA (Pfizer and Moderna) and GMO (Genetically Modified Organisms) in an adenoviral vector (AstraZeneca and Janssen) according to the European classification<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;For details of the composition and regulatory context of Covid-19 vaccines, we refer you to the vaccine data sheets on the ReinfoCovid website [1, 2].<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Concerning the monitoring of adverse events of these vaccines at the European Union level, the official website linked to the European Commission entitled <a href="https://ADRreports.eu">ADRreports.eu</a> ('Adverse Events Reports') provides raw data from hospitals and doctors in European countries (now excluding the UK post-Brexit in 2021).<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The summary table below (Table 1), corresponding to the extraction of 2021 data, patient by patient, between January 1 and April 6, highlights<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;a very high proportion of serious effects linked to Covid-19 vaccines compared to the classic influenza vaccine (inactivated virus) over the year 2020<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;a very worrying proportion of sudden deaths by its value and by the fact that these sudden deaths in less than 24 hours post-vaccination affect all age groups.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The famous benefit/risk ratio for people under 75 years of age without comorbidities should be looked at very closely, since with the vaccine there is a risk of sudden death for the patient, which is absent from the risks linked to Covid-19, whose deaths are always the result of a more or less long stay in intensive care.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;According to the website of the European Commission [3], Europe has administered 80.5 million doses as of April 7, 2021. And according to Watson Rory "Covid-19: EU looks to speed up vaccine rollout. " (2021) [4], 65-75% of the doses are Pfizer, 17-30% are AstraZeneca, and 6-8% are Moderna. We use these numbers averaged in the table below.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Data related to the different influenza vaccines, administered intramuscularly (inactivated virus), are concatenated in the table below. The live attenuated intranasal vaccine Fluenz Tetra [5] was excluded from the analysis because it was not directly comparable.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;As the influenza vaccination coverage of people over 65 years of age was 44.3% in Europe in 2017 [6] and the number of people over 65 years of age in Europe is 90 million in 2019 [7], the number of people vaccinated against influenza in 2020 can be estimated to be around 40 million.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Table 1. Summary table of side effects of messenger RNA and GMO vaccines compared to the conventional flu vaccine (data as of April 6, 2021)<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;There is a factor of 60 in the number of suspected deaths between the flu vaccine and the Pfizer and AstaZeneca vaccines and a factor of 400 against the Moderna.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The major risk of sudden death is multiplied by a factor of 2.<br>

        <p>Regardless of age, you should not get the vaccine.  Joe didn't say this because he knows that there are many people out there that have unfortunately bought into propaganda and he didn't want to say something too "extreme" that would destroy his credibility.  He had to walk a fine line here.</p>

        <p>Do you know what a super-spreader is?  It's someone who shows no symptoms because their body deals well with the virus, but they infect everyone they come into contact with because they look just as healthy as the next  guy.</p>
<p>Multiply that by a bunch since Joe refuses to wear a facemaske because he says its not manly enough and he is too macho for it.</p>
<p>It's not about what it will do to you, its how easily it spreads in the population and who YOU will infect with it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In fact, they found that the young people were the biggest spreaders of covid even though they were the least likely to die from it, just like kids are that go to school are most likely to spread the flu.    That is the reason for the vaccine. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>For someone who interviews smart people he sure does not sound like the sharpest tool in his shed.   Maybe he does not understand how viruses work.   Guys like Joe is what the virus wants the most, someone who shows no symptoms but is mobile enough to infect everyone around him and who refuses to wear a facemask because he is too cool for it.</p>
