    <strong>The Cull</strong>
    <p><h1>Submission Statement</h1>
<p>When you know you are being lied to and you want to get to the truth, first you must dismantle the narrative. Look for what they talk about constantly. That is the smokecreen. That is the distraction to focus your attention in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>Next look for things they rarely mention. That is where you start digging. So, let's apply that to covid. You want the truth? Buckle up.</p>
<p>So, we know right from the start the health agencies were all ready to gush information about lung inflammation and the infection via ACE-2 receptors. If that was the prepared distraction, what were they using it to distract from? They were hiding a second method of infection. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has an alternate binding site that targets neuropilin 1 and neuropilin 2 receptors. You know what also does that? Rabies.</p>
<p>Neuropilin are the gateway to the central nervous system and the brain. Pathogens can use them to breach the blood brain barrier that prevents most diseases from infecting neural tissue. When you see Covid patients talking about the loss of their sense of smell for an extended length of time? That is called Anosmia. It means the virus has infected their brain and is damaging their temporal lobe. </p>
<p>If all of this is not bad enough, there is more. The SARS-CoV-2 virus also has prion domains in it's spike protien. Prions are self replicating, infectious, malformed protiens that cause Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). CJD is a neurodegenerative, 100% fatal brain disorder and we can see that virus is carrying those prions directly into neural tissue.</p>
<p>At least one neuro-scientist has stuck his neck out to talk about this. Kevin McCairn Ph.D. talks about it in this video. You ought to watch it and then you won't be wondering why people with inside information are double masking.</p>
