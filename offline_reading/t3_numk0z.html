        <p>Post is gone now but for the most part we just want freedom back. Wear a mask, don't. Take the vax, don't. Our problem is loss of choice in the matter. It's the common theme among all of us here. To pretend that covid is like smallpox and can be eradicated is now a fleeting dream. So let those who need the vax get it, and lets move the fuck on. Leave the healthy and young alone. Sorry for the original retort, we are overrun by shills and trolls lately.</p>

        <p>First of all you say that cases would skyrocket if we opened up, and yes they would. They would skyrocket. But it would barely matter. Covid is nothing more then a spicy flu. It’s so weak you have to get tested to even know you have it. We’ll be fine. And don’t compare countries like the UK and the US to India, a country almost notorious for its poor hygiene.</p>

        <p>All of your scenarious are hypothetical.</p>
<p>Explain to us why Texas and Florida haven't had case explosions.</p>
<p>Do you believe people who don't want to be vaccinated also aren't following mask and distance recommendations? (They aren't). Why aren't they filling the hospitals? Why do your doomsday prophecies continue to fail to come true?</p>
<p>To any <em>thinking person</em>, it looks like the virus has to just run it's course, until we reach a certain level of herd immunity (natural + vaxxed). In every locale, regardless of counter-measures, you see a spike or two, and then it's pretty much over. Otherwise, the hospitals should be full of people who aren't getting vaccinated - and they just aren't.</p>
<p>The only effective counter-measure seems to be completely shutting your borders. This is impossible for most non-islands. Anything short of that is pointless and does more harm than good.</p>

<p>You never mention all the hypochondriacs and agoraphobes and germaphobes you created.</p>
<p>You never mention how you destroyed children's lives by making them fear socialization with strangers, friends, and even family members.

        <p>I was very much hoping you'd answer the "Why do you think you live in denial of all these consequences" question.</p>
<p>Because honest - I come to this subreddit regularly and see a LOT of posts like yours. Most are all about "ThE mAsKs!!!"... and never has a single one of them listed any of these obvious issues I just listed.</p>
<p>So I don't use the word "Denial" lightly. I use it very specifically.</p>
<p>Why do you think you live in denial of all these consequences? Did "The Science" of these consequences really get considered at all?</p>

        <p>Is it too unreasonable to expect that I just don’t hear about some things? As I said, I do want to hear about the stuff you are talking about, as I honestly do not hear it anywhere where I get information (maybe that’s just my fault for not looking outside the box). I’m not deliberately living in denial, I’ve just weighed out the stuff I know to come to the conclusion I have, and maybe, as I learn some more, I’ll come to a different conclusion.</p>

<p>What is more important than that is the way in which almost everyone from "Your Perspective" ignores the same facts.</p>
<p>Deliberate, or not, these facts aren't really "Hidden" from you. They are pretty basic "I lived through 2020/21 lockdowns and noticed from my own perspective" stuff.</p>
<p>I wish you luck in broadening those horizons and learning more, I guess.</p>

        <p>But what I’m saying is that I did consider the stuff that I knew, and I still feel like that, unless I get properly refuted with my points, that those points still do not quite outweigh what could happen - at the end of the day we don’t know though I guess.</p>

        <p>Covid is just a flu. our death rates have stayed relatively normal from all years past data! So why would you need a vaccine, or to wear a mask, or to social distance or to take an experimental injection with ingredients that are being held from the public for a basic flu? So I don’t think any of us with concerns about a “real” agenda at hand. Why do you need to stick a needle at your third eye (nasal cavity) to test for a respiratory illness. Why are they trying to use lasers at our third eye for temp testing. Why did these diagnostic test (which was said by the creator can not be used for diagnosis) have a highly lethal chemical in/on it? 
All of this just adds up to really bad news!!</p>

        <p>You will have to show a direct correlation between people wearing masks and the disease not escalating. You will also have to explain why in areas where there has been little or no masking that the cases have not skyrocketed. </p>
<p>You will also have to look at the data of people who have died. How many had preexisting conditions? What were those conditions? What were their ages? In addition, of those who contracted the disease and showed symptoms, how many recovered? How many recovered without hospitalization?</p>
<p>That's just for starters. In other words until you've done some serious critical thinking and research, don't tell me I'm wrong.</p>

        <p>To be honest, I am basing a lot of this on the start of the pandemic, and India’s current situation. In the start, people were not masked up or anything, hospitals got overwhelmed, and the rate of death by cases was pretty high (relatively i guess). In India, there is not sufficient masking up and distancing etc, and they are suffering pretty badly. </p>
<p>Also, deaths because they also had pre-existing conditions are basically still deaths. Said people would not have died had they not got covid, so it’s not like you can just disregard it.</p>

        <p>Lol, India. </p>
<p>India has over 30k deaths a day, everyday. At most,  for around a week, covid deaths accounted for almost 15% of that. That was at the very worst. Overall, India is going to see a 2% increase and this will cause a 2% decrease over the next year or 2. </p>

        <p>So first of all, covid with no restrictions had 3 times more deaths in 2020 than flu and pneumonia, and second of all, it is added on top. It is not one or the other comparison. There is a point where it is considered too many deaths together, and we were at that point (according to a lot of people). So whilst you may still not believe in locking down over it, you were still off by a decent amount.</p>

Now wouldn’t you say, if something came along that was 3 times worse, we should also be vaccinating? Or, if we don’t have the vaccine yet, taking the other precautions?</p>

        <p>I've heard this argument before - and it is exactly the entire supposed reasoning for the lockdown - the problem is that when it became apparent it wasn't working - it wasn't reversed - as was predicted - here we are more than a year later of 2 weeks to flatten the curve....</p>
<p>And you know what? Honestly, the curve never once looked "flattened".... still has the same curve as any other disease, all of this theatre, suspension of rights, etc, has been all for nothing. </p>
<p>&rt;One of the points I see here quite a lot is that young people aren’t dying so why should they get the vaccine? Well let’s imagine we let everyone free to do what they want without a vaccine, they’re going to again, skyrocket the cases, because they’ll still be heavily symptomatic. This will put strain on the hospitals again, and because of this, young(er) people will start dying, a long with a bunch of older people (like in India again).</p>
<p>Your supposing here that natural recovery doesn't leave people with natural immunity - in fact - even my doctor agreed with me that the more that we vaccinate explicitly in the way that we are with vaccines targeting only the S1,S2, and RBM (spike protein) we are putting evolutionary pressure on the virus to mutate - vs. older vaccines that let each body do their thing on a virus "training dummy" </p>
<p>&rt;Now do you see the two ways out? We either stick to the lockdowns etc, or we get everyone vaccinated. This sub seems to be against both</p>
<p>yea, lockdowns dont work and the vaccine is very worrisome scientifically - we should just let the damn thing run its course - its not the plague - we have treatments - you should go take a look at qcovid.org (oxford university funded)</p>
<p>Lastly - the vaccines kill people - thats not controversial, its demonstrable - the question I have had this whole time: If covid kills the old (average age of death from covid is something like 78) and the vaccine has been killing the younger - even if at low rates. Then aren't we just killing the youngest and most able of us to "save" the old?</p>

        <p>Where is your evidence that the vaccine has been killing the younger people? Also, vaccines do not put any more pressure than already exists towards mutations. If the virus fails to kill someone/spread to another person through someone, then it will mutate under its own steam elsewhere until it can spread more.</p>
<p>Also, there definitely will be natural immunity, just not enough to Chuck all the precautions we have at the moment.</p>

        <p>In addition (you should still watch Tom Woods’ speech): one can be simultanesouly worried about the morbidity and mortality of a virus and the emergence of medical authoritarianism, collective mass delusion, and the ruination of mental and physical health associated with profound social isolation and demoralization. </p>
<p>I wonder if you grok what life has been like for those who have seen their lives’ work which they toiled to build for years obliterated by unreasonable state policy. People who once earned a steady income who have been relying on food banks to feed their families. Children in poor nations who have starved as a consequence of the strangulation of supply chains. Patients who have suffered as a consequence of months’ long deferral of medical care. People who have fallen into despair and begun drinking liquor all day or poisoning themselves with fentanyl-corrupted heroin. Children who have been isolated from their friends and deprived of socialization for what to them has now been a huge fraction of their young lives.</p>
<p>The caricature of those who dissent to lockdowns as being concerned for rights out of mere abstract principle (this is what people are doing when they type stuff like “wHat aboUT mUH RAts”) is facile and unhelpful. Our point is that apologists for lockdowns do NOT get to take the moral high ground. Lockdowns are inhumane, and lockdowns KILL.</p>

        <p>What you and most of you types are arguing for is for is basically a society where no one is allowed to make any decision that may result in a negative impact to one or more people. </p>
<p>Any free society works when you are allowed to accept risks. If you know you are vulnerable and other people are allowed to behave in ways which may be a risk to you then it is up to you, the individual, to act accordingly. When you force everyone else to change their behavior to benefit tje few that are vulnerable, you no longer have a free society, you have a nanny state.</p>

I would let them if they declined my help. Thats the problem here and you fail to see it. The trash ideology where someone thinks someone else has the right of control over anothers choices regarding their health.</p>

        <p>To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand covid-19 and vaccines. The science is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the facts will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Fauci's optimistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his persona - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The left understands this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these truths, to realize that they're not just factual- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike distancing and masks truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the science in Fauci's existencial catchphrase "Trust the Science," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Cuomo and Newsom's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Bernie 2016 tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.</p>
