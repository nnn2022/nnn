        <p>Hey guys.  I know a lot of y'all are struggling, especially mentally.  I just want to take this moment to welcome yall to come visit us in north Mississippi (Tate/Desoto county) if you need a break from the madness.  Everything is open... restaurants, shops, salons, spas, indoor trampoline park, sporting goods stores, etc.  Some places that are under jurisdiction of the health department do require a mask on for entry, but once inside, noone gives AF.  Like we went to Longhorn Steakhouse this weekend and had it on at the front door but tossed it once seated.  I just chin diaper it and tell them I can't see bc my glasses are fogging up .  No one really cares.  A lot of local owned businesses aren't even putting up the "muzzle required" signs.  It's more of a live and let live mindset.  You want to wear a mask?  Cool.  No mask?  Not my fucking business.  I never wear one when shopping at Kroger or Walmart.  Nobody says a word.  People are still polite to each other regardless.  We even had our town Halloween and Christmas parades.</p>
<p>I know it's not Hawaii or St. Bart's.....but you can get out and enjoy some muzzle free shopping, sip a margarita or two at one of our many locally owned Mexican restaurants, and dine on some awesome BBQ and/or fried catfish.</p>
<p>Southern hospitality has not been shut down by covid....not here at least.  Try to keep your heads up guys.❤️</p>

        <p>Yes lol.  You'd actually be in the majority.  Population is majority African American, followed by Caucasian, and then there's us Mexican's bringing up the rear lol.  Memphis TN is about 30 minutes from where I live in Tate county, but restrictions are a bit stricter there so I haven't really gone unless it's to take my daughter to one of her appts at the children's hospital.</p>
<p>Yeah there are some racist dummies, but I've found they're everywhere.  We don't really claim them.  If it gives you any idea, one of the local teachers is an openly gay white guy who lives with his life partner on their cow farm.  They have 2 adopted daughters, both black, and they are all loved, active members of the local Methodist church and our community.</p>
<p>So yes, please come visit.  Tate county is small, a few mexican joints and a sushi place.  Desoto county is much bigger.  They've got Tanger Outlet Mall, tons of restaurants, lots of shopping, bookstores, gyms.  If you want to venture further north up I-55, there's a lot more in Memphis TN, but like I said, might be more mask restrictions.  I think they may have opened Beale Street back up though.</p>

        <p>The problem is NOT the mask itself, but what it represents. Got invited to dinner but our area has a mask mandate now so fuck that. If restaurants required you to wear a dinosaur costume to get in the door I would be more likely to do it than wearing the mask. The mask is "just" a bit of cloth - the cloth is not the problem, the problem is the fact that wearing the mask shows you agree with lockdowns, you're scared of the virus and you are willing to comply with this whole stupid charade. We can apply this argument to many things - it's never "just" something, there's always an additional meaning to it which is what people are really arguing over. Doomers, why are you so triggered by this sub? It's "just" a bunch of pixels on your screen. Why are you so triggered by Donald Trump? He's "just" a collection of atoms. Stop saying it's "just" this or "just" that - things have deeper meanings and you well know it.</p>

        <p>Chris Whitty (UK Chief Medical Officer) just let the cat out of the bag on live TV. I have been going back and forth about whether this is a conspiracy, or just mass hysteria and gross incompetence. I now know it's a conspiracy. He just said we'll need a lockdown next winter. Despite the fact that the government have said repeatedly that all the vulnerable people (who make up the vast majority of hospitalisations) will be vaccinated by mid February, and the lockdowns were predicated upon not overwhelming the hospitals. Not to mention that a large amount of the general public (all age groups) will be vaccinated by next winter too.</p>
<p>They have decided, a year in advance, that we will need more lockdowns next winter. Despite them having no way of knowing what the numbers will be next winter, and what shape the hospitals will be in. This is clearly about something else, I just don't know what.</p>

        <p>I wonder how much of the fucked up political environment is due to the masks. People aren't afraid of doing fucked up things because you can't identify their face. Everything feels more confrontational when you can't see people's entire face. If the population actually wants to get along and people want to stop hating each other the goddamn masks have to go. Every social encounter is more tense than it needs to be because of these fucking masks. It is the easiest fucking way to turn the population against each other and I have to wonder if that isn't still the purpose at this point.</p>

        <p>I’ve had it up to here with doomers. I’ve even taken to insulting people for trying to push these restrictions continuously, whether online or IRL. I was never like this before the lockdowns, I’ve always been a peacemaker and loved people. Now I can’t stand 99% of them.</p>

        <p>My New Years resolution was to not wear a mask again this year. Broke it the second day when I went to the store. I'm still afraid that someone asks me to leave and I don't want to call a scene. And tomorrow I have to go back to work and I have to wear a mask to keep my job. I know that this won't end if someone like me, who thinks the mask is "just" a symbol, still wears them but like many others I'm just a coward sometimes. Don't know how to deal with that. I know! I should just do it!</p>

<p>If you lose your job, you'll have a lot more to worry about. That's not cowardice. I'm all for taking a stand, but you still need to eat. Worsening your personal situation won't end this nonsense either. That's not courage. That's recklessness.</p>

        <p>I know what you mean but it is nontheless ridiculus how this mask thing is executed. I refused to wear it for a while at work (just by not wearing it, I don't argue about that at work) and it was fine. Sometimes the others play along and sometimes they don't. But as the big boss saw me once without he talked to my boss. Now I'm a bit nervous and I'm wearing the mask since then. My boss even forgets it all the time and we even made fun of this shit once or twice. It's just a game. If I lose my job over not wearing a mask I actually would laugh for a good while but sadly it's possible.</p>

<p>Asking you to leave is their final resort. If anyone does confront you, the first thing they will ask you to do is put on the mask. Use that to your advantage by going bare-faced until asked to do otherwise.</p>

        <p>Remember, even if someone asks you to put on a mask and you comply with their request, that is still an act of defiance and courage. Make them have to ask you. Show that the mask isn't normal, it isn't the default mode. I know that there are some situations where it is simply impossible to get by without the mask, so going 100% bare-faced shouldn't be your goal. You still need to see the doctor, buy food, etc. Instead your goal is to spend as much time as possible not wearing it. You don't need to get into fights with people - just not wearing it until told otherwise is the first step towards defiance. Good luck!</p>

        <p>How'd it go? I went to pick something up a few days back and the employee asked me if I has a mask and I ignored their request and they served me just like normal. The mask muffles sound really well and It's harder for me to determine someone's mood with just their eyes.</p>

        <p>Absolutely nothing happend. That store has these selfcheckout table things and I think nobody cared.</p>
<p>But in the evening the same day I bought something at another store and the women who worked there would not leave me alone so I closed my jacked over my nose. She asked me if I don't have a mask and I said "no". She said "ok, for this time it's ok". I was too nervous to go there again without mask.</p>

        <p>You know... I remember back in high school when I took history, I was appalled at how stupid humanity used to be... How enough people supported Hitler and his genocidal propaganda to actually agree with it and support it. How quick people were to believe that they were told regardless of whether it made sense or not - enough so to actually go to war for what they were told... I genuinely believed humanity just used to be stupid and we collectively got smarter and better at sifting through B.S.</p>
<p>But when I see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ontario/comments/kpmk7g/lockdown_is_a_joke/ghyzj53/">comments like this</a> on my province's subreddit, with 50+ upvotes, meaning 50+ people agreed with it, it makes me realize nothing's really changed in terms of humanity at all... People are still generally stupid and will believe whatever they're told is "the right thing" to do according to their governments and will vehemently support it to extremist extents. This pandemic has definitely made me realize HOW Nazi Germany and many other horrific periods in history ended up manifesting and being supported. It's disturbing.</p>

        <p>My 11 year old is really wanting to go back to school in person. She says she doesn't care if she has to wear a mask; she just really wants to go back. She's currently on break until January 24 and then (supposedly) schools are supposed to open again. I really don't think schools will reopen after January 24. People in my state are begging for another shut down. But even if schools do reopen, I'm conflicted about sending her back. I don't think it's healthy for her to go all day with a mask on and have to interact with her classmates in a mask. I am ready to give up on this school year and pray that things are back to normal for next school year but she really wants to go back to school this year. Ugh. I hate this mask obsession. I could deal with the security theater and social distancing if masks weren't a thing.</p>

        <p>I’ve been feeling myself growing more and more depressed by the country’s current situation. I feel it has been slowly creeping but it’s been manageable for the most part. I don’t sleep well at all anymore. I wake up crying because it’s so bad. I’ve become obsessed with the news because I’m constantly scared something is going to happen that’s bad. Everything changes so quickly every day it’s just stressful. </p>
<p>But today I had a melting point. I went to my shitty server job where I get paid $2 an hour to kiss ass hoping someone tips me more than $5 an hour to make up for the minimum wage. I’m pregnant and was sweeping the floors and had my mask pulled under my nose because I have a hard time breathing otherwise. I went up to greet my table and both women, after taking their drink orders, demanding I pull my mask up over my nose instantly. I apologized and was embarrassed and went to go get their drinks but I was starting to shake with fury. Who are they to tell me why to do? With their masks off, sitting two feet in front of me?? I accidentally sloshed the salt off the rim of one broad’s drink and set it down for her and she became very upset there was no salt. I said I was sorry I spilled a little carrying it and she laughed in my face and was obviously upset over it. She was saying I was lying for saying there was salt, I ended up just trying to pull the drink off the table and she snatched it out of my hands and insisted it was fine. Then she said next time I need to do my job better and the bartender should do better too and to relay the message. I actually get treated like this almost every shift and I have to kiss their ass and pray to score some pocket change out of them and let them treat me like this. They didn’t tip me, either.</p>
<p>I want a better life for myself than this. I don’t want to settle and be a servant for the rest of my life. I don’t want to obey ladies who come in like they have so much power and not tip so I literally have to pay out the bartender who makes those drinks from my own pocket. I’m a nice woman. I don’t have attitude at work. I aim to please everyone and make sure everyone leaves with a smile on their face. But I fucking hate this job.</p>
<p>I hate that I wanted to pour that drink in the bitches face when I was demanded to wear my mask over my nose. I hate the way these people have been making me feel. I never used to feel this angry. I never used to feel any sort of way about anything. I hate that I’ve turned against so many people and they’ve turned against me. That I can’t go out in public without anyone looking at me in hate that I might get them sick. I hate worrying about the news and decrees and governors and other politicians and things going around the world. I hate that this stress I feel every day is taking a toll on my mental health and my baby and that I had to go to the bathroom at work to cry because I can’t contain my amount of hate and sadness anymore. I want my freedom back. I want my friends back. I want to see people’s smiles again. I want to not choke on the fuzz of my mask and have my glasses fog up. I want to breathe fresh air and smell candles in the candle aisle at the store without worrying that someone will see me with my mask off and kick me out of the store. I want more courage to stand up for myself and my beliefs and when bitches tell me to pull my mask up I’ll laugh in their face. I want love and laughter and happiness and joy back in me and my fellow americans’ lives.</p>

        <p>I recommend filtering the news the read, take days off. We don’t have to be constantly plugged in to the worlds news and disasters. Our ancestors led much more mellow lives. I’m very sorry you get paid 2$ an hour, I find that so undignified. You deserve a decent livable wage and I hope you find one. Hope you are healthy and well despite the crazy world we are living in. Peace to you 🕊</p>

        <p>In my state, the mask mandate requires people over 5 to wear a mask. However, doctor's offices are requiring children age 2 and up to wear one. I find that pretty fucked up, especially because they aren't giving people a heads up that it is a requirement. This morning I took my newly turned two year old daughter to her check-up and the receptionist said she had to wear a mask. I said that my daughter has never worn one before and the state mandate is 5 and up. She said that I have to at least try and if my daughter won't keep it on, then it is fine. Sooo...if it is fine if my daughter doesn't keep her mask on, then why do I even need to try? And what defines "trying"? </p>
<p>I put the mask in my pocket and went to the waiting room. I sat to where we were out of the receptionist's view. She didn't come and find us and no one else said anything. My daughter didn't wear a mask for this appointment but her next check-up is in July and I highly doubt this mask hysteria will be over with by then. So depressing. Why are people okay with babies wearing masks? Even the doctor was telling me that wearing a mask is safe for babies (bullshit).</p>

        <p>I remember when I was a toddler and my parents told me not to put plastic bags on my head because it was dangerous, you might suffocate. Now society is actively encouraging kids to cover up their breathing holes... how things have changed! Actually as a form of protest I now feel tempted to go out with a garbage bag on my head just to show everyone else how dumb they look with their stupid muzzles.</p>

        <p>Masks and toddlers can make for a funny scene. A neighbor made my son a dinosaur mask as a gift. Very nice of her. I knew he wouldn't tolerate it but we tried just for kicks. He kept it on for 5 seconds and then ripped it off and tried to put it on our neighbor's labrador, who was barking a few feet away.</p>

        <p>I have had enough. And decided to take action. Since this is getting worse not better. I applied for and got a condo to rent on the intercoastal in north Dade. I can’t wait to get sun, and eat in a restaurant. It’s a year lease, so I guess I’ve given up on Canada. It’s a big of a financial stretch, and I have to figure out employment, but YOLO.</p>

        <p>Florida is glorious. It’s highly underrated. It’s also a big place when you get out of south Florida is very southern and more conservative. Where I am going (because I have friends there) is one of the annoying democrat areas which have mask regulations. But they cant fine you for not wearing it. I intend to get lots of sun and sea.

        <p>I'm so jealous! Are you American, or have a visa to the USA? If not, they only let you stay 6 months sadly. </p>
<p>I'd love to go with you though. I love Florida's approach to letting people live their lives and taking responsibility for themselves. It'd be nice to be down there in the heat, with access to a gym and without the lockboots around here with their condescending superiority complex.</p>

        <p>Funny you bring that up, i'm actually looking into going to school for something that will net me a career in a field that will allow me the option to go to the USA one day. I'm still trying to figure out what field that is though. I have a draft typed up I want to post on /r/IWantOut for advice I just haven't posted it yet. I'm also getting into the power of manifestation and law of attraction and i'm manifesting the ability to go to the USA permanently one day soon! </p>
<p>I wish one of my parents was American though. That'd make the process so so so easy. Of course they both have to be Canadian... Ugh!</p>

        <p>Well just thank your lucky stars you’re not Australian. It seems like the commonwealth countries really love authoritarianism. </p>
<p>IT does a lot of H1B visas. I’m sure you’ll figure out a plan since you’re very motivated and focused. I know the universe will open up for you! Just keep pushing and don’t give up, that’s my secret to life basically.</p>

<p>I'll definitely look into IT! I saw a list once actually of all the jobs that the USA is recruiting skilled workers for, I haven't been able to find it since but hopefully someone on /r/IWantOut will be able to link it to me.</p>
<p>Thank you!! I'm definitely determined to do it and I can't wait to join you in the USA. And good luck with your move! :) I know things will fall into place once you get there.</p>

<p>If it makes you feel any better - I am flying down to Florida one of these next few weeks to check out the North Eastern area around St. Augustine. Tired of PA. Can't do the mask mandate shit anymore. I miss real interaction.</p>

        <p>Yes you’re right it’s a Democrat area with mask regulations. The governor made it illegal to fine anyone for not wearing a mask. I am moving to Dade because I have a good friend lives there, I agree it not 100% ideal. All the restaurants, stores etc are at full capacity. It’s not perfect but it’s a good comprise. I really want to hang out with people again and do normal stuff. I also have a ongoing job that may or may not happen on one of the Caribbean islands and it would be better for my flights if I’m near MIA.</p>

        <p>Without getting into politics (The sentiment as a whole can be applied) is anyone just appalled at the robotic / hivemind behavior of people? I have some Youtubers I watch and they are all very different in their content. Every single one of them has a tweet out, actually not just one tweet - MANY - of "Fuck Trump!", "Finally the 4 year nightmare is over", ect, ect.  </p>
<p>It's not even so much about liking him or hating him, but that they behave as those their personalities were copied and pasted.</p>

        <p>Pretty much just garden-variety virtue signaling. Much the same happened with BLM this summer - people who were formerly almost entirely apolitical saw which way the wind was blowing and got on board, very loudly.</p>
<p>The window of publicly acceptable difference-of-opinion just keeps getting narrower and narrower. Soon it will be all but extinguished: there will be exactly 1 correct opinion to have on every conceivable subject.</p>

        <p>Legitimately I cried the night trump won.  I was so depressed.  Now I look at what our country has done to remove one man, a man who actually represents millions of people’s opinions, and I’m terrified.  It’s horrible that people can’t accept others for what they believe in even if you think it is wrong.  I also believe in the balance of power in government and it’s clear that many people do not  And they legitimately want a one party government.</p>

        <p>I posted above something about this. Is it not terrifying to see how much we are hated as well? No, this sub is not meant to assume that most people are Trump voters - actually plenty have been against him but think the lockdowns are crazy.  </p>
<p>With that being said - isn't it sickening to see the publics response to him and his supporters? I truly fear for how we will be treated in the future. Never in my life have I seen such blind and rampant disgust for a group of people. I forget what news outlet it was but they said the Trump ideologies need to be CLEANSED from America.</p>
<p>Oh, and here's a tweet I found appalling " In future, all mentions of name Trump will be removed from public spaces, some of his descendants will be recluses, some will change their names, and most of his supporters will deny they supported him. The legacy of Trump will be of an American fascist, seditionist, and traitor. "</p>

I was raised catholic and hate what the Catholic Church did but do I hate all catholics? no! I don't even hate the pope! It's so bizarre to me.

        <p>For a long time (even before the lockdown crap) I felt like most people were just carbon copies of each other with minor cosmetic differences. They all have similar personalities, similar interests, similar low IQ...in a time when "everyone is unique and special", really nobody is special at all. They are all the same and they hate you if you differ from them significantly. If you don't like the brainwashing box? You're out. You don't want to buy all the latest fancy gadgets (buy the new phone and ipad so you can watch the propaganda anywhere, 24/7)? You're out. You don't follow their false idol "celebrities"? You're out. Popular culture keeps the bugmen together and keeps you on the outside.</p>

        <p>going back to work monday and i am about 50/50 sure i had covid this past week (covid test came back neg as well as for strep), i definitely had a fever with fever dreams, night chills, headaches, dry cough, runny nose, sinus pressure, all the bullshit that comes with covid now. </p>
<p>i work in healthcare, which means we get an advanced dose of the vaccine. i am not looking to get it but i am afraid they are going to mandate it as a condition of continued employment. why that is, given everyone else who will be vaccinated and me who is in an age category for 99.99% survivability and someone who gets his exercise in, i don't know. </p>
<p>i just cannot understand for the life of me how i do not have the right to bodily autonomy to where i could have the power to say no to this foreign agent that is being asked to be injected into my body and that still be respected. i still need a job, i guess i could work from home but that will eventually reflect negatively on my career and probably future prospects. i can kinda see the chess moves for where this is headed, it will very likely be mandatory at my company to get to stay employed and short of a fraudulent vaccine letter i don't know another way out of it short of quitting and looking for another job which will take who knows how long</p>

        <p>I'm in healthcare too, and am worried that they are going to make the COVID vaccine mandatory.  They've already offered it to us, and the patients (we're long term care), to get an idea of how many doses to order.  The majority of both have declined.  They don't force us to take the flu shot each year, so I don't see how they can force us to take this.  Then again, with the way things have been going, who knows.</p>
<p>I had no hesitation taking the Hep B vaccine, and am religious about my tetanus shot every 10 years (or earlier if I get scratched/bit at work).   Those are both actual threats in this environment!  But, this one?  Nope, I'd have to seek employment elsewhere.</p>

        <p>The likely scenario is that covid will die quickly in the next 2 months. In the US, it's simply running out of people to infect and truly at risk people are likely to get a vaccine soon. Remember the horrible flu season of 2017-2018? Neither do I. And neither does anyone else. This will fade.</p>

        <p>I feel that. I seriously am having a hard time. I have a 2 year old and I find myself longing for the good old days, before all of this crap. It makes me sad because I was always told that the best days are watching your kids grow up. And I love watching her grow up...it is just hard with what is going on right now.

        <p>I feel you, mom here to an almost 3 year old. I was so excited for her to start preschool this Fall, because I was hopeful things would be back to normal by then. The thought of her starting preschool virtually, or being forced to wear a mask, is honestly too much for me. If things aren’t back to normal, I’m either not sending her, or I’ll enroll her in private daycare/preschool because I don’t want her to have to grow up thinking this is how life is.</p>

<p>My suggestion is to find a light, if you don't have one already, and to hold on to it with dearest life. Whatever is going to happen, and we don't know what that will be, you will always have your light with you. Something inspiring and wonderful, joyous and free; that they can never take away from you because it's yours and yours alone. These are going to be some testing times my friend. :)</p>

        <p>Well, I just found out my gym cancelled my membership. They are closed today, but my online account "could not be found". I have been going around in circles with corporate (both on the phone and in writing) after they told me my half shield was "no longer allowed" after I was already checked in and had changed into my workout clothes. A couple days ago, I sent them a picture of myself wearing another plastic (acrylic) mask that covers even more of my face. They approved it and agreed to refund me one month's worth of membership on Friday, then did this when they knew they would be closed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't wear cloth or paper due to (documented) medical reasons, and I have told them this many times. I'm filing an ADA claim against them, and when they lie to the government, I've got a couple of other ideas. Tell me how this isn't about control at this point.</p>

        <p>Update: I emailed them the day this happened (yesterday), and they emailed me back this evening. Apparently there was a glitch in the system. I am now able to get in to my account and will see what happens when I try to go inside later this week.</p>
<p>Moral of the story, never be afraid to stand up for yourself. If no one will fight for you, don't be afraid to fight back alone. You will only be as free from these restrictions as they let you or as free as you let yourself. :)</p>

        <p>i cant take this shit anymore. so our gov (lebanon) announced a 25 day lockdown starting from jan 7 cause apparently "cases are increasing"(even though our deaths have been consistent for 4 months). even though the last one had absolutely no effect in stopping the spread (im pretty sure our pm admitted it). and theres a new curfew from 6pm to 5am (like bruh what does corona spead 10x faster in the evening or something) and theyre reinstanting the dumb system of the odd/even car rule (basically if youre car has an odd license plate you can only travel on x days and vice versa), all of this is because apparently people were naughty and travelled on new years (how dare they people celebrate the end of a year where we had a port explosion and a severe economic crisis). were literally at risk of famine here, but hey our corrupt gov's gonna lock down the country cause why not.</p>
<p>edit: oh and they dont even give you money to survive and then complain about you trying to feed yourself and your family</p>

        <p>A simple thing as a haircut has driven me insane. I’m
in one of the most lockdown states and I have patiently waited for hair salons to re-open. They did, for few weeks and I had difficulties scheduling because it was so busy in my own life. Hear hear our dear governor announced lockdown until Jan 7th. The hair salons closed again and reassured they’ll be back after 7th.</p>
<p>I wish I was that naive. I knew once he closed all the businesses again, there is no freaking way they will reopen for another 6-9months probably. </p>
<p>I know I am vain and selfish whatever you want to call me. But I am at the point I am ready to shave my head and just be bald. It’s so freaking unscientific when literally almost everywhere else the fucking salons can be open!! And why weren’t they allowed to open when we didn’t have this stupid “spike”?? I’m losing my mind</p>

        <p>I feel like I have to setup some home salon type illegal haircut to avoid the mask. Or let my hair grow down to my shoulders. Sure wearing a mask for 30 min "isn't a big deal" physically but I'm soo done with this I refuse to participate in this public health tyranny. I forget some people are still in areas where salons are completely closed.</p>

        <p>Do it, seriously. In CA plastic surgery is ok to be open but hair salons no. I’ve been begging that the stylists would just operate illegally at least. But they’re extremely compliant or whatever even though they complain in IG about the lockdown. I cut my hair just shorter myself and it looks awful haha.</p>

        <p>Just made 1 post in r/covidvaccinated and got banned. My post? It was to say that Pfizer is planning to offer the vaccine shots to members of the placebo group by March 1. This information is literally on the Pfizer trial website. Apparently that was too much. </p>

        <p>From what I've read this is a pretty stupid dicision, they only can be used for emergency use and haven't been fully approved. I hope they consult with autorities before they kill their vaccine. It's also good to know about long term effects right? Even if the chances of that occuring are very small.</p>

        <p>I just found out that my 82yo grandmother, the woman who basically raised me, has been diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer and showing signs of dementia. Obviously, I knew this was a possibility since she was a heavy smoker and worked in an oil refinery for most of her life.  </p>
<p>What gets me unbelievably worked up right now is that my mom was basically forced to abandon her at the hospital because of "covid protocols" not allowing visitors/support persons and most of the time my grandma doesn't remember why she's in the hospital. Hospital staff haven't been interacting with her very much and I'm so furious knowing my grandma is alone with nobody to advocate for her. My biggest fear is that she will die in the hospital alone, without any family or any idea why she's there.</p>

        <p>I am trying to go around maskless as much as I can. My state tightened up mask restrictions in November and required stores over a certain square footage to keep someone at the door to ensure people are wearing masks. That sucked because I had two grocery stores I went to that did not enforce it and now they have to. This morning, I went to one of the grocery stores and no one was at the door so I didn't bother putting a mask on. I usually just put it on to get past the door and then move it under my chin.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no way around it at my daughter's gymnastics classes. I either wear it or she doesn't get to participate (it is a parent/child class since she's only 2). She doesn't have to wear one, which is my only concern. And I guess when she's old enough, she can do the class by herself so I won't need to wear one since I'll just be sitting and watching.</p>
<p>I also have to wear one at the dentist and doctor.</p>
<p>I am trying to avoid places that are super strict about it. Unless there is an emergency where I have to fly, I won't be flying anytime soon (I'll keep my vacation destinations to an 8 hour or less drive...8 hours is my cutoff for driving). And I won't be visiting any theme parks or museums this winter. I am hoping the mask mandates will be loosened up by the spring so I can take my daughter to the museum by then. If not, I'll just have to do it. I was hoping to visit Disney World by the time my daughter is 3 but Disney seems to be fully in mask Nazi land so I probably won't be able to take her for a while. Oh well.</p>

        <p>I live in MA, where masks are technically required everywhere, including outside by yourself in the middle of nowhere. I have never worn a mask outside and no longer wear a mask in the subway stations I use to get to and from work. I dicknose on the trains themselves. I pass several cops a day and not one has ever said anything. Once a fellow passenger said "you should adjust your mask." I ignored her. YMMV</p>

        <p>Yavapai County, Arizona - I go to grocery stores and convenience stores without masks. (Some other places won't let me in though.) I also go to two different restaurants without a mask. One is Asian owned and has a sign requiring masks but they never say anything to me about it; the other is a Mexican place and they don't even have a sign.</p>

        <p>Every morning, I wake up with this horrible fear that comes to me before I even start thinking about anything. And then it takes me one or two hours to work up the motivation to get up from bed.</p>
<p>Even escapism like videogames doesn't fully take my mind off what is happening or make me feel a lot better.</p>

        <p>I had that 15 years ago when I was seriously bullied. I used to dread school so much that my body would anticipate it to the extent I would wake and automatically have an anxious and twisted stomach. My brain would catch up and realize: oh no I have to go to school. Even years after the bullying I still woke up with that feeling. I would not wish it on anyone. It’s such a helpless and sad feeling. I think you are in a hostile environment or having to walk around in one. </p>
<p>I would advise to complete your stress cycle when you can (google it if you want, it involves running, hugging someone you trust for 20 seconds, looking at a comedy for example to release stress hormones building up) 
And to watch the positive negative ratio: when one negative event happens it takes 3 to 5 events to counter it. Negative events are powerful and drowning. </p>
<p>What I learnt in those hard times help me so much now, if I could take a time capsule back I’d kick ass ha ha. What you learn in this time will help you too, I believe in you! Take care of your mental health, i can tell you are overwhelmed and exhausted and I wish you the best 🕊</p>

        <p>My step father was a great role model. We are Irish and he grew up in the 50’s in the countryside in the west of Ireland, his mum died when he was a baby and his dad had to take care of 6 kids somehow. He used to tell us he walked to school barefoot in sun, rain or snow and only as an adult does it hit me how his family struggled. He stopped going to school at age of 13 (my mum too in Dublin ) but he was one of intelligent, logical people I knew. 
He used to tell me that there is no point in worrying. The news have a new crisis every week to sell newspapers. He lived through Chernobyl and didn’t loose his cool when the world was going to shit. The Cold War, the troubles in Ireland (he was in Belfast once when bombs went off). 
He said if you live your life worrying, you may have wasted it. It’s important to be aware and act when needed but no point stressing. Then he got lung cancer and I saw him for the first time afraid. And I’m glad he didn’t spend is life afraid, only when there was an actual threat to his life. 
You just got to protect yourself where you can, build resilience, enjoy your life in the little moments, hike mountains, spend quality time with those you care about. I think we are all getting swept up in modern life, tech, seeing so much scary news but we don’t have to know about every problem happening or stress ourselves. I accept that I can’t control how I will die, my stepdad couldn’t either but I’m not going to suffer before I really have to.</p>

        <p>I know I’m considered young...
But I am 28 and I just wanted to do so many things in life. I wanted to travel, and eventually decide to have kids.</p>
<p>One of the biggest issues I’ve faced is trying to confront my own biology. That realistically now, I will likely never have either. I know I could in theory have kids now, but it feels selfish to bring a life into the world and make them go through this with us. At the same time, I am unable to travel, partake in social activities or hobbies.</p>
<p>I don’t want to be a reverse doomer but it’s more and more looking like there is no end in sight. And I will have lost my window to experience so many things in life.</p>

        <p>Both political sides are now using the vocabulary "traitor(s)", "treason", "coup", etc. At the same time, we are also being shown through media that violence and illegal action get more results than protests and legal routes via courts and other government bodies. Some examples would be statue removal, defunding police, and the most recent situation in the Capitol building, which caused more than enough senators to reneg on their objections. One could argue that the perpetrators were Trump supporters, and the outcome was not in their favor- but those illegal actions still caused people to change their beliefs, and changed the way the rest of Congress's discourse went about. It has also now fueled the race-baiting agenda for the left, in that they now claim that the BLM protests were significantly more abused and riot-controlled than the white Trump supporters; some even claiming that police stood down to allow this, and some were taking selfies with the criminals.</p>

I don't care if you wear a mask, though you are free to do it if you want. I believe you should be allowed into the hospital with your wife to see the birth of your child. I am not looking to shut down your business and deprive you of your work and income. I am not going to shut down your school and stunt your child's education. And on and on. In short, I haven't asked you to do a fucking thing for me and I haven't hamstrung your life in any way. I ask that you show me the same courtesy.</p>

<p>That's fair possibly you haven't and if you really haven't, than you're at least consistent.</p>
<p>It seems this sub has a care free, "live and let live" attitude toward somethings (like mask wearing) but not others. That' what really gets me.</p>

        <p>Most of this sub seems to lean politically right. The political right in general wants to limit what people can do with their own body (abortion, euthanasia, etc.), limit what they can put in their body (marijuana, psilocybin, etc), and limit where people can live (immigration).</p>
<p>The fact that so many people, including a lot here I would imagine, can say simultaneously that it is dictatorial to force someone to wear a mask but claim it isn't dictatorial to force a woman to carry a child she doesn't want to term, is absolutely insane. Or hat I shouldn't be allowed to choose to end my life when I want, but they should get to choose when they wear a piece of cloth over the mouth and nose. </p>
<p>Like I said, it's definitely not everyone here, but I assume it is quite a bit.</p>

        <p>I haven't seen this board pushing for anti-abortion positions. With any large group of people, you get a plurality of opinions and this board is no different. Some likely are anti abortion. But for drugs, I know lots of conservatives and I haven't spoken to anyone in years who wants pot and shrooms to be illegal. My cop friends laughed at me when I asked them if they still bust people for that stuff (they don't).</p>

        <p>The point of the mask is <em>not</em> to stop the spread in and of itself. The point is that wearing the mask is so annoying and stupid that many people are simply not going out in order to avoid it.</p>

        <p>I have a friend who religiously follows all the covid statistics. Today, after weeks of draconian lockdown (where I live) she said on Whatsapp that cases have gone down. A few days earlier they were going up. (and the same-- back then, weeks of lockdown had already been in effect)</p>
<p>I'm entirely uninterested. ''Cases'' don't interest me in the slightest, this madness shouldn't depend on ''cases''. My human rights shouldn't depend on ''cases''. It's nuts. It's a dumb play with empty numbers. I couldn't care less and it has no meaning whatsoever.</p>

        <p>I know what you mean about the obsessive following. One of my friends lives in Europe, and the other day he was asking me how I was coping because there are like 2 cases in my city (a small place in Aus). I was just like, "what cases? There are cases here? I didn't know about any cases!" I wish I could know why they are so crazy about keeping track of the cases, cases everywhere, not just their own city but they can rattle off the numbers for basically every country in the world, it drives me bonkers.</p>

        <p>Hi. I recently decided to get back onto reddit, and found this sub-reddit. I would like to stay around for long, but I don't know if I can.</p>
<p>Recently, my cousin's girlfriend has apparently gotten 'Covid'. My cousin and aunt got their masks on. While that should be fine under normal circumstances, I don't think they'll be fine with me not complying. Because after all of the hypocrisy shown by Dems, as well as the dystopian-esc lockdowns and whatnot, I don't think I can stand being around them. And I think that if I don't move out, they'll just kick me out with less things to pack.</p>
<p>Am I scared? A little bit. I haven't really been on my own in years, I think. I don't have a driver's license, enough bags to carry most of everything, and don't really have anywhere else to go(besides another cousin's house, but that's far likely to happen).</p>

        <p>You know what I’ve been thinking about lately? 
Whose bright idea was it to design the thermometers like a gun? 
You all stand in line and someone points a gun shaped object at each of your heads and pulls the trigger. 
Next thing you know they will be saying “We have developed a more accurate thermometer that can tell if you have a fever, but also can tell specifically if you have ‘Rona” and it is going to be 6 guys, people all lined up against a brick wall, and the design of the thermometer will be strangely similar in appearance to an AR-15 🤣</p>

        <p>Definitely not. But then again most of the indoctr-I mean school system is not looking too hot these days. I try not to be pessimistic but it seems people would rather not fight the way the world is going because it’s always easier to just consume product and be lazy than to actually put forth any effort. I truly do hope that people surprise me in the future though.</p>

        <p>As things currently stand, in the US we have awhile yet (supposedly a couple months before general availability), and of course volunteers will be at the front of those lines. I would naively assume them not to start getting really pushy about it until summer.</p>
<p>I'm not sweating too much yet, because it still remains to be seen what happens with the election / inauguration and everything. Our country may have much bigger existential issues come February/March, than forced vaccination.</p>

        <p>It will be a while before we have to worry about that. The vaccine is being rolled out in the United States extremely slow. Hospitals are actually throwing out expired vaccines because they don't have enough staff who want to get it. I don't think someone in the general public will be able to get one until the summer at the earliest. I used to think March/April but that isn't looking good. I wouldn't think that it could be mandated until it was readily available to everyone and that is looking close to 2022! It will be a long time before we have to worry about it.</p>

        <p>The company I work for is doing its annual training meeting virtually this year and it started yesterday.  A few of the higher ups in the company were in the office while the rest of us are remote since we are all over the US.  The main person speaking was in a conference room with a few other people...spread out as much as possible in the room..and weren’t wearing masks because who wants to hear someone mumbling through masks for hours?  Some busy bodies complained that they should have all been wearing masks.  🙄.  If they wear masks in the conference room and mumble the whole time I’ll just let the meeting run while I do anything else because I don’t have time to waste listening to someone I can’t understand.</p>

        <p>I don't understand the fixation on cruise ships....they have <em>always</em> been filthy cesspits of illness. People always get sick on them. Previously this was just laughed off as "oh well" or "it won't happen to me", despite the majority of cruise participants being elderly. Why do we suddenly care now?!?! It's time for the world to wake up and realise that travel/tourism isn't just about holidaymakers, it's an entire economy and millions of people's livelihoods and lives depend on it.</p>

        <p>I mentioned in the last weekly thread I was invited to an NYE party, but it was cancelled. Turns out the party started out small, but got big because the people who were invited also invited people! In the end, the guest list hit over a hundred and the party would've led to people getting arrested.</p>
<p>Still disappointed, but at least, I know I'm not an anomaly in my area! Truthfully, I dislike parties, but I tested negative twice and work in a job where I'm highly exposed anyway, and that contains over a thousand workers at any given time, so a party wouldn't kill anyone.</p>

        <p>One of my coworkers got Covid about a month ago. She is fine. She’s 60 and it was basically a mild cold and she lost her sense of taste and smell, she’s gotten it back since though. </p>
<p>Before that, people were basically on the same page as me, agreeing the lockdowns were kind of unnecessary, no need for masks if we’re working in the drive thru, etc. Ever since she got Covid, everyone has changed their tune. They’ve all turned into doomers who think that they’re going to die of Corona, and that we will be wearing masks til 2023 because of this new strain. I hate it, I feel so alone now. </p>
<p>I’m also pregnant, so people are giving me even more shit, saying “You should be more concerned about this, considering you’re pregnant”. No, I’m a healthy 27 year old woman. I’m aware that getting Covid while pregnant would suck, but I also know that I’d be fine, I won’t die of it and my baby will be fine. I prevent Covid the way I prevent myself from getting the cold/flu. Wash my hands frequently, take vitamin C, drink a lot of fluids. It’s worked out fine for me for the past year, I haven’t gotten it yet.</p>

        <p>Expecting another crackdown starting late winter or early spring, possibly with more civil unrest this time. I just hope my husband can go back to work soon without a COVID test or vaccine so we can save up some money and be a bit more secure. Also expecting more panic buying and product shortages, so we've been slowly but surely stocking up on various goods. Husband and mother-in-law just got home from a shopping trip; our "to stock up" list includes vinegar, bleach, hydrogen peroxide, rubbing alcohol, disinfectant wipes (for mother-in-law's MRSA drippings, not COVID!), toilet paper, paper towels, purified water, orange juice, pineapple juice, and various canned goods. Any other suggestions? Ammonia just crossed my mind, as that was hard to find in my area last time around, but we don't use it very often. Also wondering if we should stock up on vitamin C tablets, since my husband doesn't have the most nutritious dietary habits.</p>

        <p>My mother-in-law has a MRSA-infected chronic abdominal abscess that requires surgery to "fix" every other year. It intermittently leaks blood and pus, especially on the toilet seat but also sometimes on the floor. Often she doesn't even notice; might ask if my husband or I injured ourselves, or if I'm on my period. She also leaves these crusty butt-prints and some weird gray powder that sticks on the toilet seat, sometimes also shit on the side of the toilet. Pretty sure she has C Diff too.</p>

        <p>So today is lame. Quebec, the province next door to mine, enforced a curfew for the next month... Which of course is stupid and will accomplish nothing. And the good news is LOTS of people on /r/Canada have been critical of it. The majority of comments in fact have been. I also saw <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/krqls3/long_pandemic_could_add_to_extremism_decline_in/">this post</a> talking about how more restrictions could add to extremism and a decline in democracy. And most comments are of people who are waking up and cheering it on! Gives me hope that if they try to enforce more restrictions, we might see some sort of revolt towards those restrictions form. </p>
<p>The bad news is, I see this curfew announcement as setting another dangerous precedent for the rest of the country. I wouldn't be surprised to see Ontario follow suit... And if that happens, I genuinely think people would fight back. I said as much last night on /r/Canada, and woke up today to find I was banned permanently from the sub for that comment. No reason given and I didn't break any of the subs rules. I guess the lefty mods didn't like more free thought spurring about.</p>

        <p>As Canadians I feel like we are definitely as a majority more compliant than Americans although I see what you're seeing as well comments on/or/Canada and/or/Ontario are becoming ever so more critical about these things and doing things like making jokes about the lockdown in Ontario and then getting the front page this stuff wasn't happening a couple months ago they were all talking crazy about how we need to do this and how we need to do that</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I wouldn't worry about getting banned from that sub/R/Canada has a long history of censorship and meaningless bands all you have to search is the sub red's name and censorship on Google and you can find many documented cases they actively engage in censorship and bad people for no reason you did nothing wrong</p>

        <p>I honestly don’t know how much more of this I can take. My fiancé and I applied for a visa so he could finally move to the US from Canada. This was in January 2020. Since then, we’ve gotten approved and our case even reached the US consulate in Montreal but it was closed for 5 MONTHS! Even after Quebec was no longer in lockdown, they still kept closed. Now, Quebec is heading towards another full lockdown like the one in March and I swear to god if the consulate remains closed for 5 months like they did before, I don’t know what I’ll do. We’ve been apart for 5 years and I was really hoping my fiancé would’ve been here with me by now but obviously that’s not the fucking case. I’m just so angry at everything - the Canadian Government, Trump’s restrictive immigration policies keeping consulates abroad closed yet still keep shit open in the US, this entire system in general. I’m sick of it</p>

        <p>Every day I walk around the city without a mask and everyday it feels like the final scene of Invasion of the Body Snatchers (Donald Sutherland version).

        <p>Yesterday on a Nu Yorg etatS IT phone call (~3000 listening) they began discussing an ID system so that people could go to the stores/restaurants/malls and be assured that everyone around them was not infected. There were things said, and things not said, but from the reliability of the tests, one would think that "not invected"==vaccinated. I am not fear mongering, or trying to spread imaginary things. They said it was in the beginning stages as proof of concept, and encouraged people to step forward with ideas.</p>
<p>I have a question for you: if you were in my position, would you step forward with an "idea", so that you could keep in-the-know about this project? I feel like affecting from within never tends to work</p>

        <p>I feel insane. Sometimes I debate if I am actually in the wrong. I am currently on vacation in a large city. While it is open, everywhere requires masks. I see people even outside with them, even while the air is fresh and a breeze, people still dawn the mask. I see some people here and there with them off, and often times we nod to each other or tip our hats like we understand each other’s thoughts. I wonder though, am I actually insane? Am I in the wrong? I see most people around me wearing their masks religiously, and it makes me wonder if I am actually wrong. I use logic and common sense behind my rationale, but is there something missing that I don’t get? I feel like I am going insane. Especially in the big city, others that take off or pull down their masks like me are far and few between. Just yesterday alone I got yelled at over a dozen times to pull up my mask. In my small home town people are much different, but even so in many places not masking is frowned upon to the point of getting kicked out. I feel alone, but I know I am not the only one that feels this way, but I sometimes question myself, and my thoughts and feelings. It’s just hard not to feel this way when nearly everyone else around me shames me, or yells at me for not wearing one, or being against them. I am not against masks, but just want people to be allowed to make their own decisions. I feel like this will only go further, and is why I want people to be able to make their own choices. Does anyone else feel alone? Or like they are going insane?</p>

        <p>I know how you feel. 95% of people wear masks even outdoors in my town. There is a path along the ocean I go for a walk at and it boggles my mind seeing almost everyone wearing masks like it is sown to their face. I live in a remote neighborhood and go for a walk each afternoon in my neighborhood and the rare people I see will give me a frightened look and scramble to get their mask on even passing each other well farther then six feet apart. It's just insanity but we are shamed to feel like we are the crazy ones.</p>

        <p>The nice thing about masks is that you can use it as a mechanism to sort out the sane people from the nutcases without having to ask probing questions. Those wearing masks outside are either stupid or vapid, with much overlap. It's best to ignore them. If you want, you can tell them to piss off.</p>

        <p>So I'm supposed to drive my grandma to a doctors appointment tomorrow and my uncle came over from the US so he was asked to quarantine they told him at the border that no one else but my grandmother can be in the house so even though they live in a very rich neighborhood where no one would care if I came in for supper they're not letting me come in and complying with all of it</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>When my uncle told me it wanted to say well you could just ignore that guy but I figured that the fact that he's calling me about it in the first place means that either he felt he needed to comply with that or my grandmother is forcing him to so I just said yeah that's fine whatever I find this often crazy because last time he came a month ago we saw him of the day after his quarantine was I really thought that my family was smarter before this because he's pretty well off I really want to hope that it's not him and it was that my grandma forced him to because she can be a little weird about this stuff</p>

        <p>My school is handling the lockdown so badly. The person who’s helping me with my schedule is pushing for online so I can get in a certain class, but I know for a fact this class is offered in person and would likely not be full. I’ve been emailing him but I might just have my parents call because he’s done nothing and has been very unhelpful. If it were in person this would already not be a problem</p>

        <p>Just curious: has anyone had their license renewed during this time (or any other form of ID)? How do they handle masks when they're taking your photo? Do you have to remove the mask for it, or do they take the picture with half of your face hidden? (seems unlikely - when I had mine done before all this crap, they would get angry that my long hair concealed parts of my face)</p>

        <p>For a family member's license picture they did it without a mask (told them to take it off when they were ready to take the picture).  It would be pretty pointless to have a license picture with a mask, I guess.</p>

        <p>If we're a bunch of losers, what does that say about you that you spend your time diving into the 'dumbest' parts of 'scummy websites' just to seek attention and stir up shit? You could go literally anywhere else on reddit - or the Internet, for that matter - for endless back-pats, but instead you use a burner to cry about people having a different opinion? "Echo chamber! Echo chamber!"</p>
<p>Oh, and let's not forget the textbook attempts at social ostracization ONLINE of all places, in a group of people who clearly aren't worried about what your ilk think of them: the forced laughter emoji, the 'basement-dwelling incel' trope (an old standby of would-be ostracizers since time immemorial), the 'you need therapy' bit, blah blah. You're just a self-righteous doomer trying every tactic in the book to shame a stranger online. Bruh, we get that shit like 200 times a day around here. It hasn't worked yet but you're welcome to keep trying in hopes you'll be the first.</p>
<p>Also, <strong>really</strong>? You want to pretend it's not a burner? Even though you have exactly zero activity in any other major, general-interest subreddit? You just out of nowhere discovered reddit 28 days ago, and sought out a highly specific sub to start discussing your degenerate weed sickness? Oh and right after that you made a beeline for a semi-obscure fringe subreddit to merely talk shit? Conveniently from an account that would be easily dispensed with if you got banned / lost a bunch of karma? Uh-huh. I'd say "use your brain" but yours is self-admittedly fried.</p>
<p>So it's clear you're a liar, as well as an asshole. See you around on your next account, and the one after that.</p>

        <p>Thank you for this sub.  I needed a sane opposing view.  My family and friends are middle left to pure left with a touch of extreme left.  I’ve always been open minded and I skew libertarian at times but very open minded and i care about how my actions affect my neighbors.  I hate absolutes and I hate dogma.  I question everything.  There is some (SOME) good reading here to help balance the Rachel Maddow show in my house without turning on Rush or Fox.</p>
<p>Again, thank you for the counter argument and sane questioning.</p>
<p>I wear a mask indoors because I like the idea that if everyone did it transmission would be very low.   I don’t mind and have no desire to be an outlaw or teach society my lesson.</p>
<p>I question the severity of this virus.  Granted it’s 10-50 times more deadly than influenza but that’s like having fifty cents compared to a penny.</p>
<p>I’ve had no close friends or relatives get sick.  My wife has friends who have recovered.</p>
<p>I don’t believe this is a conspiracy to take away people’s rights.  I do consider that China would benefit economically from a pandemic and a fearful, torn USA.  Not enough to cause it intentionally, but enough to stand back and let it happen.  If China had contained it, they would be ‘jumping on the grenade’ economically and I don’t see that happening.</p>
<p>I believe the CDC and I believe it when they say surface transmission and water transmission is very unlikely.</p>
<p>I believe simply breathing, not just coughing and sneezing, can transmit the virus.  Talking, yelling and singing even more so.</p>
<p>I believe the economic impact has been bigger than necessary.</p>
<p>I’m really torn between the good of the many over the good of a few.  I don’t like the idea of a draconian government lockdown, but I also don’t like the idea of ignoring the pandemic and allowing free spread.  If something is preventable, we should try to prevent it, right?</p>
<p>I am not a conspiracy theorist, but I do like ufo’s.  I want to believe.  I see no conspiracy anywhere with COVID-19 nor do I seek one.</p>
<p>I will take the vaccine.  I look forward to it.  I believe in vaccines.</p>
<p>I wonder when I can go in a grocery store without a mask, even after vaccination.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading while I explore my own feelings and beliefs about this whole mess.</p>

<p>A lot of bad things in life are preventable. Banning driving and cigarettes alone would save more lives in the long run than are possibly being saved from covid. Not to mention banning alcohol, junk food, making exercise mandatory, making donating a part of your salary to charities that help starving people. Why should you be able to spend $10 on a video game when that money could prevent 5 deaths in Africa?</p>
<p>That is the lockdown logic.</p>
<p>Also, there is actually no evidence that lockdowns save lives. Sweden had no lockdown and their death rate for 2020 is completely average, same as any year.</p>
<p>It is entirely possible that lockdown caused some people to die from covid who would have otherwise survived because lack of exercise, fresh air and sunlight weakened their immune system.</p>

        <p>This'll be downvoted to hell if anyone sees it, but man... this is just sad. </p>
<p>I get that this seems scary, I get where you're all coming from, but I'm sorry, you are wrong.</p>
<p>People will die.</p>
<p>People <em>have</em> died. </p>
<p>This virus will not go away if nothing is done to fix it. Natural immunity will not save everyone. There is historical precedence in mask usage, and studies showing that they work. Again, I get where you're coming from with your fear, but ultimitly all that people will see is a bunch of people looking them in the eye and saying, "I don't care if people die."</p>
<p>I know know one will read this, or if they do I won't change your mind. But still, can't help but be a bit sad.</p>

        <p>I hope you don't get downvoted, because that would be against the spirit of this sub, Thank you for posting your view in a polite way.</p>
<p>Much of this comes down to questions like "how much of your life are you willing to sacrifice in order to possibly delay the death of someone elderly that you have never met?", "how long would you be willing to maintain that sacrifice?", "would you be willing to stay indoors indefinitely, apart from once a day, but under curfew and threat of fines / criminal record?"</p>
<p>These questions have never been asked and we haven't been able to give our opinion; indeed opinions that differ from the one true narrative are not allowed to be discussed and not allowed to be presented (except for places like this sub).</p>
<p>During the 90s there was heated debate around gay rights. Every differing opinion was allowed to be shared. There were compelling arguments from different groups. I felt included in the discussion and that I could express my beliefs and opinions. Ultimately society decided that gay rights were a positive thing. My point is not around gay rights, it's around the fact that we used to be able to have difficult, emotionally charged discussions in the public square on complicated issues. With covid, there is one narrative and one narrative only. You cannot disagree or challenge that narrative, this is forbidden.</p>
<p>Personally, I want to see our society discuss the difficult questions that this pandemic has raised. "what value is life?", "is it enough just to be alive?", "if an additional 50,000 lives are 'saved' every year by draconian rule, is this noble and worthwhile?", "what future does humanity have if all we are doing is locking down in an attempt to stop some people from dying prematurely?", "can I have a choice in this?", "if I am elderly, where is my voice in this? Do I have an option to tell people that I don't care if I die, I would rather live the rest of my life in freedom than in captivity?"</p>
<p>There are no easy answers, the problem is that no-one is allowing us to ask the questions, or to have the discussion. We are being treated like children by a 'government-that-knows-best' when it's clear that they don't have a clue what they are doing.</p>
<p>If someone tells you to just believe something, despite evidence to the contrary, and you aren't allowed to challenge them for fear of reprisal, well that's a bit of a problem isn't it. And that's where we are right now. Believe us, don't question us, be afraid and obey us.</p>

        <p>I think that's fair, and I thank you for your respectful comment expressing your feelings. </p>
<p>It's fair to want to feel like you can discuss this, and I agree that healthy debate is a good thing, and necessary to have for a country to truly be free. But I think the way people feel about it is that mask wearing isn't just a government mandate but something that should be done for the common good. Since many countries have put masks to use and aren't suddenly turning into dictatorships, many probably don't consider that a valid reason to worry. And even if it was, I think people are more worried about accidentally killing themselves or other people. In addition, there are studies that show mask wearing actually helps, so many just view mask wearing as a logical decision for themselves. </p>
<p>I think also that people would be fine with others not wearing masks if it was only putting themselves in danger, but the problem is some people are more likely to get infected (such as the elderly or immunocompromised) and won't get a choice in whether or not to be at risk (and of course even people who aren't obviously at risk have died from it too, so not just those people). So if those 50,000 people died because of their own choices that'd be tragic, but it's their choice. The problem is that a lot of people being affected by it <em>aren't</em> choosing to put themselves at risk and are instead being hurt by other people, which is why many feel that people who don't wear masks are selfish or uncaring. (idk if I worded that well? Hopefully you get my point). </p>
<p>Sorry if this sounds like an argument, I don't mean it to be. I'm just trying to share my opinions as well. ^ ^</p>

        <p>Don't apologise please, this is a very reasonable discussion and I appreciate it.</p>
<p>Masks. Why do we wear clothes? We wear clothes because they keep us warm and protect us. Also they protect our modesty. Sometimes we need to wear armour or protective gear because of dangerous situations. </p>
<p>But people wore armour when they went into battle. Masks are telling us that we are in a permanent battle. It's like the war on terror or the war on drugs. It's a permanent war. There's never going to be a victor and it's never going to end. Wear your mask forever because this is a war on bacteria/viruses. It will never end so the best thing you can do is arm yourself everyday against it. NO. </p>
<p>Do we give in to terrorists? Maybe a little sometimes (9/11) but generally no. But wow have we given in to this virus. We have let this virus dominate and control us as a people. The virus is the one in control, not us. Where is our pride? Where is our human spirit? Where is the courage that took us from apes to the moon? All gone for a measly virus that has killed barely .01% of us. Shame on us for our cowardice. We are living in the age of cowards.</p>

        <p>Back in April, perhaps this made sense. High filtration masks are not really available to the public and the public is scared. Cloth masks are garbage but might help a little bit. And if everyone is using them, they are more effective than if only you are. </p>
<p>But that's not the case anymore. High filtration masks (N95, KF94, KN95, etc) are widely available to anyone who wants them. Ebay has legit 3M N95 masks for $3 each. These sorts of masks <em>will</em> protect you, regardless of what others are doing. If you are concerned for whatever reason, then buy and use real equipment. Don't go around with some shitty mask you bought off Etsy and then complain about what others are doing. If your health comes first, act like it.</p>

<p>The way a lot of us feel about it is that masks don't do squat, especially homemade and/or bootleg ones. Most of my masks are two layers of fabric - like, cotton, with cute patterns on it. Thinner than a t-shirt. All it does is make my face sweat and make me queasy, since my classroom is warm and humid AF.</p>

        <p>Just a heads up about the vaccine.  My brother is a small-practice family doctor and he had a sit down with some Pfizer reps.  There is a reason doctors and VIPs are all getting the vaccine.  The conspiracy theorists are correct that the Covid-19 vaccine doesn't protect you from covid-19 but all the other wild theories about nanobots and what not are misinformation.  The covid-19 vaccine doesn't pprotect you from covid-19 because it is a vaccine for a virus even worse that they haven't realesed yet.  Please take the covid-19 vaccine before they release the next virus and its too late.  They are targeting the anti-vaxxers.</p>

<p>If you think that Pfizer reps - the kind who would be having chit-chats of any length with small-practice doctors - would have ANY special inside information on what's really in a vaccine ... well, I don't know what to say.</p>
<p>Any information like that would be known by about as many people as the complete Coca-Cola recipe. And probably fewer, because unlike knowing a cola recipe, you could be executed by governments for having any foreknowledge of it.</p>
<p>I'm not discounting the possibility that this is what's in store - only that your story of how you came by such information is highly implausible to say the least.</p>
<p>Cute attempt to trick people into taking the vaccine, though!</p>

        <p>It's going to be "a mutation" of the current virus.  It will be very similar except this one will target younger people and be very lethal.  The pandemic will end when it's killed off most of the unvaccinated people and herd immunity is achieved leaving a population that is much more obedient to the government since all the dissenters have been killed off.</p>
