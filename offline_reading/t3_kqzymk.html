        <p>Pay attention, their only way out, for a long time, has been coming up with names for people. You can perceive this trend increasing in volume and reach. Everything now, as soon as it is launched, any campaign, comes up almost instantly with an opposition carefully designed to shelter the undesirable under its umbrella.</p>
<p>&rt;Planes are love, planes are live. I love planes! Do you love planes? Are you ready to become a plane?<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;No. I don't really like planes. TBH, I think planes are harmful to society as a whole.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;aRe YoU aN aNtIpLaNe? Are you prejudiced against planes? You must be a NADZEE incel who has a tiny dick and no one wants to have sex with you. You have no friends and when you were a kid I bet no one wanted to play with you and you are a fat virgin!<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;edit: Sorry guys I'm not fatphobic, also #pride #acab #blm slay kueeeeeennnnnnn</p>
<p>They keep pushing this neologisms into people who don't fall in line. Any agenda out there comes out with its opposition already planned out from the get go.</p>

        <p>The least harmful option would be to let the virus run its course just like every other virus in history. Not useless lockdowns, masks and social distancing then rushed vaccines which seem also useless. All for a virus with low mortality rate and something so deadly that you need to get tested just to find out you have it. Will people die yes, just like it happens everyday. Death is a part of life. How many millions of people lost their jobs their homes their lives because of some mass panic the media and govt used against us? Way more people have lost everything and face death from starvation or other means now because of these useless measures. I doubt you'll hear about these stats in the news though because people rarely die from anything other than the vid these days. It would have been better to let things be and then develop so-called vaccines if they wanted. There is more than meets the eye with this.</p>

        <p>Exactly. Masks, social distancing and lockdowns are not completely harmful to everyone, but the vaccine must be to at least a few for them to have no liability, and in fact I know because there are already many reports of very serious short term side effects, god know what's the long term effects will be like.</p>

        <p>I don't see how masks are harmful, aside from being slightly uncomfortable. Lockdowns do cause serve economic damage however. This is why the vaccines had to be developed very quickly compared to normal, so the economy can recover again without tens of thousands dying every day.</p>

        <p>The world of humans has never worn masks all day long for days or months and now it will be going on years soon, perhaps forever the way it looks. So you see because we as humans are used to seeing facial expressions and it's also an important part of communication, our brains are used to seeing these expressions and we receive a release of chemicals when we see emotions. By blocking out our ability to see others expressions and emotions it causes a lack of the release of these chemicals which cause a withdrawal effect. Not only that but it's difficult to hear people with a muzzle on their face and for others with hearing impairments and who are used to reading lips this also causes serious communication issues. Depression is at an all time high, no doubt because of these psychological warfare measures that our govt has enacted against us. They've been studying us for years so they know what they're doing.</p>

        <p>Mask wearing should be used is public spaces, such as stores, not when visiting your friends. Making it moderately harder to read strangers' emotions via facial expression is not a significant disadvantage.</p>

        <p>Dr. Margarite Griesz-Brisson MD, PhD is a Consultant Neurologist and Neurophysiologist with a PhD in Pharmacology, with special interest in neurotoxicology, environmental medicine, neuroregeneration and neuroplasticity. This is what she has to say about facemasks and their effects on our brains:</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe reinhalation of our exhaled air will without a doubt create oxygen deficiency and a flooding of carbon dioxide. We know that the human brain is very sensitive to oxygen deprivation. There are nerve cells for example in the hippocampus that can‚Äôt be longer than 3 minutes without oxygen ‚Äì they cannot survive.</p>
<p>There is more. But I'll leave you with that. Obviously some scientists disagree but I reckon there's a high chance half of them don't actually know what they're talking about and have been paid to say that.</p>

        <p>Oxygen molecules are small enough to travel straight through the mask so excess carbon dioxide inhalation isn't a problem. Paying scientists to tell people that mask wearing is safe would just be wasted money.</p>

        <p>Well said.  This is a great analogy. </p>
<p>Each helps a bit. (In all honesty, I never wore a seatbelt until the car wouldn't work without it, and still occasionally exceed speed limits. I would disconnect airbags if I could.  I had a car totaled from a minor impact, but it would cost more to replace the airbag than the car was worth). </p>
<p>You are right.  It's additive protections. Some would take it further.  You might compare shutting down every indoor dinning restaurant to a mandatory 10 MPH speed limit.  It reduces deaths.</p>

        <p>Masks don‚Äôt eliminate the threat. They reduce the likelihood by catching some/most of the droplets. Social distancing a advised to further decrease the risk of coming into contact with the escaped droplets. Lockdowns to ensure people don‚Äôt flood malls etc to ensure they aren‚Äôt put in a position to where you have lots of people in one place. I‚Äôm just taking a stab at it.</p>

        <p>Dude, I am right with you.  I am as NNN as anyone here. On behalf of a part of the sub, I apologize for all the downvotes. </p>
<p>But let's face facts.  It's all about percentages.  None of these things "work" as in eliminate 100% of risk.  Each is below 100% But it's additive. </p>
<p>We should not be arguing that things don't work, we should be arguing that their marginal effectiveness is not worth the cost. </p>
<p>The fact is that all of these things WILL slow the spread.  They will not stop it. And the cost is too high.</p>

        <p>Isn‚Äôt the percentage reduction significant? Also slowing down until the vaccine arrives = more lives saved? 
I‚Äôm not fully in favour of lockdowns. I feel like if people could wear masks and observe social distancing then they wouldn‚Äôt be (as) necessary.</p>

<p>The largest economic cost is the shutdown of small businesses, well and large businesses  employing small people. (eg. Disney workers)  It's really impossible to separate damage from mask vs socially distancing vs business shutdown vs any other NPI.</p>

        <p>I am very willing to engage in discussion.  But I can't start with a premise of  "Non mask compliance is the full reason for shutdowns".  The latter preceded the former, and I know of no reason beside governmental fiat that one should cause the other. </p>
<p>Let's start with an easy one.  Which form of intervention would you say is most effective at reducing virus spread?  a) social distancing (ie 6 ft, no big crowds), b) wearing masks or c) shutting down businesses deemed high risk?  You may add a D) if you like.</p>

        <p>A and B, if followed universally, in my opinion, would likely take away the necessity for C. However, restaurants, for example may be an exception to that because the nature of that business requires breaking A and possibly B to allow to open.</p>

        <p>Absolutely. There are documented cases of transmission at more than six feet and less than 5 minutes of exposure. And, masks, while shown to provide protection to your nose and mouth, do nothing to prevent aerosolized particles from getting into your eyes. My car has brakes, an emergency brake, and assuming neither of those work, a seatbelt. I wouldn‚Äôt dare drive the car without one of them.</p>

        <p>You were very close to getting it, but missed the point.</p>
<p>A lockdown is only relevant for 3 weeks at one time and have NO ONE go outside and interact. This forces the virus to die off because it can't spread, anyone with it, either dies or gets better and is no longer contagious. </p>
<p>You are correct that the masks and the social distancing work together they are additive. That's prevent a person with covid from spreading it to other people. This allows people to go about their business without the need for lockdowns. </p>
<p>HOWEVER, every person that doesn't wear a mask, is a person who is voting with their actions FOR a lockdown. </p>
<p>Once hospitals hit peak capacity, they can't handle anymore cases of anything, not just covid, any disease, any injury, etc. </p>
<p>That forces the government of that location to have a shutdown because they have to immediately prevent the spread getting worse. Why would it have gotten way worse, because people DIDN'T socially distance and DIDN'T wear masks, and DIDN't stay home and self isolate as much as they can willingly. </p>
<p>Now we have vaccines and we can stop with the masks, and the social distancing, and the lockdowns. </p>
<p>But, I swear the SAME people are now bitching that the Vaccines are a hoax and are out to get us, and have microchips and other stuff. </p>
<p>It's like they HAVE to have something to complain about, which is just prolonging actually going back to normal.</p>

        <p>It's amazing reading these responses and understanding what you get. The point the lockdowns is because people don't fucking listen. If you listen and wear masks and socially distance you don't need lockdowns. </p>
<p>That's why lots of states lifted the initial lockdowns. Then people didn't listen and it spread like crazy again, and bam, another lockdown. </p>
<p>I read it in a meme the other day that said it perfectly, these same people, if there was a real zombie outbreak, would be like "NO zombies are fake and a media hoax and you can totally get bitten by someone else and it doesn't do anything except to old people and you don't need to carry a weapon to shoot zombies theres no problem, just let people go back to work and stop telling people to stay indoors away from the zombies." </p>

Nobody thinks the masks work 100% to stop the virus, nobody thinks staying six feet away will 100% stop here virus, they work together to HELP stop the virus, but still not 100%, hence, lockdowns. The vaccine is rushed because none of us fucking like the masks, or social distancing, or the fucking lockdowns.</p>

        <p>Why do you feel the need to cuss at me..?</p>
<p>Now just because I'm curious, I crunched the numbers. </p>
<p>I took California who has 39.5M, at 40,723 cases yesterday. 
To SD who is 884,659 , at 111 cases yesterday. </p>
<p>Compared the populations, which holy cow that's a lotta people in that state which brings it to 1 Californian equals 0.0223 South Dakotans. </p>
<p>That means, by looking at it on a per person basis, if CA had the same population as SD, they would have had 912 cases yesterday, making them 8.8X worse.</p>

        <p>Besides, next I wonder what your answer is.  </p>
<p>How long are you willing to put up with these restrictions?
I took this seriously in the beginning, but like many others here - we've watched it go from 14 days, to months, to nearly a year now; we object the moving the goalposts over and over again. </p>
<p>If they had factual evidence to say we need cases at this number and with this proven method, probably half of us wouldn't be here and would agree with the 'experts' but instead what we are seeing is Fauci saying on TV that masks are a scam to trying to imprison people for not wearing them, the Surgeon General saying not to buy them (wouldn't this be trying to get people to die), Pelosi telling people to go out and have fun in Chinatown, to the WHO literally changing the Definition of Herd Immunity behind our back, or the CDC saying something is wrong then posting the same thing a week later, to governors/politicians telling people to not go out and then post videos of them on vacation or go out to eat.</p>

        <p>Masks aren't for your protection. They are for everyone else's protection from YOU, if you have covid and are spreading it, even if you are non-symptomatic. Masks lower the chance of spreading the virus. </p>
<p>The social distancing is in place because it lowers the chance of infection. </p>
<p>If people refuse to wear masks, then social distancing is more important. If people refuse to wear masks and socially distance, then lockdowns have to go into effect because people didn't listen. </p>
<p>Only one lockdown in the very beginning was helpful. Continued month after month lockdowns are not helpful if people are wearing masks and social distancing. </p>
<p>The vaccines are so that people don't need the masks, or the social distancing, or the lockdowns. Masks and Social Distancing are not protecting you 100% or other people, they are "slowing" the spread. Only a full hazmat suit will protect you from breathing in viruses in the air. A vaccine will protect you from whatever virus its for much, it actually protects you, so you can't get the virus.</p>
<p>Wearing a mask and socially distancing has a way higher chance of still catching the virus that getting vaccinating. Vaccination is about stopping the spread, not slowing the spread of the virus. </p>
<p>Rushed vaccines are because people want to stop wearing masks, socially distancing, and having lockdowns as soon a possible. </p>
<p>Vaccines, or car/driving, or food, or even surgery, nor anything are magically 100% safe. They all have risks. </p>
<p>You don't HAVE to take the vaccine, if you are afraid of it; once most people have taken it and most people have immunity. But that means you and only you will still be able to get covid and die. But at that point, with actual establish herd immunity, that's your choice to die or not.</p>

        <p>What you say about the vaccine is not what the FDA says.</p>
<p>Read this <a href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-frequently-asked-questions">FAQ page from the FDA</a> on the Pfizer vaccine.</p>
<p>YOU - "Vaccination is about stopping the spread, not slowing the spread of the virus."</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Q: If a person has received the the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, will the vaccine protect against transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from individuals who are infected despite vaccination?</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;A: Most vaccines that protect from viral illnesses also reduce transmission of the virus that causes the disease by those who are vaccinated. <em>While it is hoped this will be the case, the scientific community does not yet know if the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine will reduce such transmission.</em>  </p>
<p>YOU - "A vaccine will protect you from whatever virus its for much, it actually protects you, so you can't get the virus."</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Q: Is the the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine effective at reducing the severity of COVID-19?</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;A: To date, only a small number of severe cases have occurred during the study, which <em>makes it difficult to evaluate whether the vaccine reduces the severity of COVID-19</em>.</p>

        <p>Wow, I don't really know how you managed to misunderstand how vaccines work so hard, yet went through the effort of doing that much research on the FDA's site. </p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/covid-19-vaccine/covid-19-vaccine"> Common question</a>
&rt; What would a COVID-19 vaccine do?
&rt; 
&rt; A vaccine forces your immune system to make antibodies against a specific disease, usually with a dead or weakened form of the germs. Then, if you come into contact with them again, your immune system knows what to do.</p>
<p>Basic point, what do vaccines do?</p>
<p>Lets say there are a bunch of blankets full of smallpox. </p>
<p>a) You didn't get the smallpox vaccine and you touch the blankets, you end up getting small pox and get very sick and die. </p>
<p>b) You got the smallpox vaccine and you touch the blankets and you get small pox in your body, but your body already has been exposed to small pox in the vaccination so your body just creates all the anti-bodies it needs to kill off the infection before it spreads in your body. </p>
<p>Simply, it gives you the ability to beat the virus before it ever really multiplies and infects you. </p>
<p>&rt; YOU - "Vaccination is about stopping the spread, not slowing the spread of the virus." </p>
<p>Yes, exactly. If you have the virus for a very short period of time because you have the vaccine anti-bodies your likely maybe even contagious for a very short period of time. Then your not even sick at all because you body killed every single virus in your body. </p>
<p>If your sick with covid/asymptomatic you are spreading the virus the entire time your sick which is days, that's the whole point of the 14 day quarantine period. </p>
<p>If you are vaccinated, nobody quarantines for 14 days. </p>
<p>Wearing a mask, like I said slows the spread of the virus, it simple "mathematically" exposes less people to the virus then if you just breathed on them directly or a whole group of people. Same with social distancing. </p>
<p>Being vaccinated is a whole other level "slowing the spread" to the point that you are essentially "stopping the spread". Let alone that if everyone is vaccinated then the spread is irrelevant because people are already prepared for catching the virus, so the "horrible symptoms and death" don't spread even if the actual virus is still technically very slowly spreading. </p>
<p>&rt; YOU - "A vaccine will protect you from whatever virus its for much, it actually protects you, so you can't get the virus."</p>
<p><em>To date, only a small number of severe cases have occurred during the study,</em></p>
<p>Yeah that's the point, in layman's terms "protects you, so you don't get the virus" means you don't get a severed infection from the virus. That's what "getting the virus" ie "getting sick". Everyone comes across germs everyday and "don't get sick/don't get the virus" because their body has strong immune system and has seen the virus before and as soon as it is detected it is eradicated from the body by their anti-bodies/white blood cells etc.</p>
<p>The study showed, that so few people got sever cases during the study they didn't have enough data to make a conclusion, but what the data did show is that the vaccine works for most people in completely preventing them from getting sick in the first place because their immune system just killed the virus before it got them really sick. </p>
<p>Now if someone doesn't fight off the virus as well as the should despite being vaccinated, we don't have conclusive evidence that they will only get a mild case. </p>
<p>So, again like anything in medicine there are probabilities that things work and things don't work sometimes. But in the case of the vaccine so far, it show it works in most cases "stoping people from "getting" the virus" ie a bad infection/strong symptoms and in some people, a very small number, it just didn't work. </p>
<p>Everything I said is just a simplified laymans version of the basics of how vaccines work. </p>
<p>I get a vaccine, I can walk around all day not worrying (99%) that I will not experience a horrible case of covid, my body will just kill it off before I even notice. </p>
<p>I wear a mask and socially distance, I can walk around all day assuming I might at any point get Covid and end up in the hospital. I just know that if I happen to have it and are asymptomatic or have very limited symptoms and I don't know its Covid, by wearing a mask and socially distancing, I will be doing my part in not spreading it to many many people.</p>
