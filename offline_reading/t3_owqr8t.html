    <strong>The Vaccine Gave Me Nerve Problems</strong>
    <p><p>I have been asked by several members of this group to post my story.</p>
<p><strong>Beginning:</strong></p>
<p><strong>First Day</strong> - Received first dose of Pfizer on right side. My right pinky immediately went numb and I could feel pressure in my lower back.</p>
<p><strong>One Day Later</strong> - I felt numbness below my lungs above my intestines. I also started to itch randomly as if it were small pings going off. I really didn't have to itch them, they'd just fire off, all over my body randomly sometimes. My left wrist went numb. My lower back was much heavier now in pressure. It was like a hurting pressure inside of me.</p>
<p><strong>Five Days Later</strong> - Slow heartbeat while sleeping. It woke me up. It went away later that day.</p>
<p><strong>2 weeks post-vaccine</strong> - Nothing major. I slept a lot.</p>
<p><strong>2 and a half weeks post vaccine</strong> - Things got bad. The pressure around my hips spread to my sides and stomach. I kept getting pressure and aches around my sides at my hips. It was worse on my right (injection) side. During my sleep, I could feel that spot below my lungs and above my intestines again. It felt like a nerve lighting up. I could feel the length of it as if it were a wire. During the day I also started feeling odd nerve tingling across my stomach towards the surface of my skin. This was like electric pings across my skin.</p>
<p><strong>3 weeks post-vaccine</strong> - Extreme pressure on my sides.  I had to stand up very tall (and stretch myself vertically) in order to walk because the nerves in my gut/torso were so squashed together that they'd rub as I walked and hurt badly.  Also, the nerves in my shoulder blades felt pancaked together and also as if they were trying to peal off of my muscle or skin.  It was like they were squashed and trying to pull themselves apart.  An intense nerve pressure spot on my right side torso seemed to either radiate up my back and across my stomach.  This was an intense nerve firing off with extreme sensitivity like it was tore up or very angry.  It was like a firing off toward both directions.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><em>Note: I went to many doctors who dismissed me saying the vaccine could not possibly do any of this.  It was hard to find a doctor who understood what was going on.  When I finally did, I tried many things.  The following are the things that actually worked:</em></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>4 weeks post-vaccine</strong> -</p>
<p><strong>IVR &amp; Pepcid Trial:</strong></p>
<p>Day 1 IVR: Good feeling in entire nervous system.</p>
<p>Day 2 IVR: Good feeling in entire nervous system. The only thing I am experiencing now is a sore side.</p>
<p>Day 3 IVR + First Day of Pepcid: I had no idea I was so bloated. My waist and stomach have shrunk significantly. I now realize I had been bloating ever since I got the shot. I never bloat so I didn't even realize it. The Pepcid, in my sleep, targeted the sore side and surrounded my nerve with an intensely good feeling. [40mg of Pepcid all at once].</p>
<p>Day 4 IVR + Second Day of Pepcid: The best I have ever felt to date. [20mg of Pepcid morning + 20mg of Pepcid night].</p>
<p>Day 5 IVR + Third Day of Pepcid: [20mg of Pepcid morning + 20mg of Pepcid night].</p>
<p>Day 6: 100% Better. All symptoms completely gone.</p>
<p><em>Note: Doctors say IVR can bind to spike protein and clear it out.  They also say Pepcid can help because it is an H2 blocker.</em></p>
<p><strong>One Week Later:</strong></p>
<p>I took IVR again because I was following the "use it for one day a week for a month" protocol. I took it for this one day and some of my symptoms came back. Note: They did not all come back and they did not come back as severe. I started feeling the nerve pressure on my right side only on my back and front.</p>
<p>I decided not to take IVR anymore because it made the pressure come back a little bit.</p>
<p>I took three more days of Pepcid and it didn't do anything.</p>
<p><strong>2 Weeks Later:</strong></p>
<p>I started taking liquid liposomal glutathione and it has helped clear my remaining symptoms a lot. I did 1500mg per day for a week. Now I am doing 500mg per day.</p>
<p>I am 90% better.</p></p>

        <p>I think it's interesting that the two medications that were given to combat the vaccine are also capable of treating covid. </p>
