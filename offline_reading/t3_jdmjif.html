    <strong>I’m sick of privileged people talking over others.</strong>
    <p><p>In my state there is a little town called Leavenworth. It’s in the mountains and it is Bavarian-style. All the writing on the stores is the same Bavarian font and it is such a nice area. In the winter it is beautiful. I have reservations for a hotel there in December and I’m going with my husband. </p>
<p>I’ve heard people say that places like that are sick of “tourists bringing COVID” and I can’t disagree more. Towns like that rely on tourism to bring in money. They want people to come. Everyone who’s said that they don’t want tourists are out of their minds. There are a few mountain passes to get through the Cascades and it is on one of the less traveled highways through. It’s not on an interstate so less people go through it. It’s a road not a lot of people go through during winter, they’d rather go on I-90. They have business because people want to go to that town. </p>
<p>It just goes to show you how much people don’t understand. Privileged people are constantly talking over others and it doesn’t matter if it’s helping or damaging. I’m getting tired of it.</p></p>

        <p>I’m in Portland and always wanted to make it up there... I wonder how insane they are going to be about masks. I just can’t bring myself to vacation anywhere that is mask-crazy. I like vacays to be a BREAK from what I suffer through in my daily life. Not more of the same.</p>
<p>Vacation destinations have hung their hopes on the idea that more people will show up if there’s a lot of hygiene theater, because they will feel safe. I wonder if that’s true, or if it’s the opposite: would-be travelers who don’t give a hoot about covid are now staying home because they don’t want to spend their vacay money just to be hassled all week.</p>

        <p>I'm loving the phrase "Hygiene Theatre".</p>
<p>Who sets up business in tourist towns? Small business owners. People like Bob Belcher. They are the enemy of the People! Only big box stores and Amazon are for the good of the People. How are we all going to be smashed like bugs under the boot of our betters of we can run a restaurant?</p>

        <p>I was there in August. I was in eastern Oregon for a softball tournament and we went back home through Highway 2. They require masks in stores but if you’re just walking around they don’t care. I’d say it’s definitely worth it. I don’t know if they’ve changed their rules since then. I was only there for an hour before we got going.</p>

        <p>Lake Tahoe residents still complain about tourists visiting the lake.  The same with the residents of nearby coastal Santa Cruz. The interesting part that more people are getting covid in the agricultural areas of Santa Cruz county, but not on the sunny beaches.</p>

        <p>Mammoth residents are complaining similarly.  They want the tourists to stay away so they can have the natural beauty all to themselves, not realizing their town will basically die without tourism.  Or caring that not everyone can afford to live somewhere so beautiful and must leave town to visit it.  People are bored AF right now.  They <em>need</em> an escape from the heavily restricted cities.  And there's nothing they can do to recreate at home, so they go to the mountains.  What does anyone expect when you cut people off from their only local forms of relaxation?</p>

        <p>As someone who's occasionally used these laws as a means of controlling my own ego, I can testify to their effectiveness. It's so much easier now than ever before to be egotistical and disguise it as some sort of "truth-telling" or uncovering some new knowledge that others are just too dumb to understand, so having lessons of humility like this is really reassuring to people like me.</p>
<p>I like to call these "The Ten Commandments of Humility" at times, because I believe that to be the primary goal of these ten laws. It's a shame that the Danish(?) book this was based off of hasn't been translated into English yet; or, at least, I can't find a copy of it, physical or digital, online. I wish I could at least provide context for the laws, is all.</p>
<p>Anyways, thanks for highlighting these. I wouldn't go so far as to say that it is the sole reason why Sweden is the exception to the rule in this pandemic, but it definitely plays a big role in how Sweden operates on a cultural, societal and political level. I only wish there was a similar code of conduct in the United States.</p>

        <p>I've checked out the meaning of Minnesota nice and I agree that the laws can be abused in that way. The Jante Law can cause a lot of passive-agressiveness from its adherents, even if it's unintentional. On the other end of the spectrum, I think the Jante Laws, when taken to the extreme, can cause its adherents to express an irrational submissiveness to others - that is, the belief that one is wrong 100% of the time and can only have their beliefs validated when others permit them to or agree with you.</p>
<p>I don't believe that one who follows these laws has to be devoid of any independent beliefs out of the fear that one is 100% wrong all the time. Rather, they need to be open-minded and willing to challenge their beliefs, and, above all, refrain from imposing their beliefs upon others. That's the main takeaway from them, in my eyes, but there is much to take away from them overall, and I think Scandinavian culture knows this more than anybody else.</p>
<p>By the way, if you still remember where you had read that book in English, and if you believe it is accessible online, do you mind redirecting me to it so that I may read it as well? I've been able to find many PDFs of it online in Danish, but never one in English, however hard I've tried to find it. I would love to get more context behind the book that seemingly brought these interesting laws to fruition, and besides that, it's a sci-fi story if I remember correctly, which I am particularly delighted to read about.</p>
<p>Thanks again for telling others about these laws, even if on Reddit out of all places. Although I myself can't verify how much these laws influence Scandinavian culture (because I'm American), I can definitely testify to their effectiveness, and I wish more people knew what they were. I think if more people understood what these laws were, we would all be happier people and more willing to see others through without immediately resorting to antagonizing others or labelling them as "the enemy".</p>
