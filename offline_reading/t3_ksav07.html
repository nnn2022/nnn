        <p>The guy appears to be doing this routine as a shill for selling his vitamins to a gullible niche of anti-vaxxers, conspiracy theorists, and people who hate the government. I read some of the comments and it's mostly people thanking and "<em>god blessing</em>" him for "telling the truth". And lots of people replying "True". </p>
<p>Googled his name and came up with an article on the FTC website and some complaints with the BBB in St. Louis, about his practice.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/06/ftc-sends-letters-warning-35-more-marketers-stop-making">FTC Sends Letters Warning 35 More Marketers to Stop Making Unsupported Claims That Their Products and Therapies Can Effectively Prevent or Treat COVID-19</a></p>
<p>I know there are crazy people out there, but what scares me is the number of followers that they have and how committed to the conspiracy theories these people are. These people seem to thrive on social media, and if they don't want to take the vaccine or wear masks, fine, but their rights to their freedom to choose to do that ends where it puts the rest of the population at risk.</p>
<p>I hope these conspiracy theorists are not a "new normal", but I fear they will be. Between the election and the pandemic, it seems like we have a country more fractured into distinct groups, and at least one of the groups seems to be made up of a lot of low IQ people.</p>

        <p>Still more medical expertise than politicians. </p>
<p>Especially governors blackmailing the hospitals. </p>
<p>Check the other links I've posted: there are few epidemiologists if you need specialists. </p>
<p>Then again I do recommend video with Pam Popper - medical advisor who made entire series on how to read statistics and medical journals. </p>
<p>And last but not least research World Doctors A
lliance. </p>
