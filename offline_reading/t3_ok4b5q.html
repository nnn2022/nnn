        <p>I sent some guy a video of a doctor explaining why the vaccines are not safe. He said it was b.s and that the doctor didn’t cite his sources. So I provided him a list of the sources he used, straight from the doctors secretary who was happy to provide them. Still wasn’t good enough. Nothing is good enough honestly don’t bother.</p>

        <p>If the person is asking in a genuinely curious manner, I will provide a source.  But usually it goes something like this:</p>
<p>"Vitamin D is good for the immune system."</p>

        <p>I had an argument with a guy and posted sources. He responded with a whole bunch of sources that were articles saying “studies suggest” and using words like “may” and he seemed mind blown when I informed him that they worded it that way for a reason. It isn’t confirmed, it is just a hypothesis that they are testing, so far it seems to lead a certain way, but in reality someone just turned the study into easy click bait. When the study is completed, it will most likely show nothing of any real interest.</p>

        <p>Even when you give these shills a source, they then ignore it, and screech and howl about the source itself.</p>
<p>its a neverending cycle, but the brainwashed will never click a link you provide. I resorted to linking them to a search result and tell them to pick a source they trust. They usually screech and howl like a fuktard because I didn't spoon feed them a source that they can complain about.</p>

        <p>Here's the things with the "source?" people:</p>
<p>I believe they are being trained to reply that. The internet is almost completely censored at this point. So for many things, the only source you will find is from an independent news media. If you link it, the person just brushes it off as "unreliable". </p>
<p>There's one thing that I mention A LOT. And Everytime I bring it up, like clockwork, I get "source?"</p>
<p>It was from an article about people in the Astrazeneca trials saying "God is dead. I can't feel God. My soul is dead.". This stuck with me pretty heavily and I bring it up fairly often. It was originally in the mainstream news, but they have all erased it and only small sites (many Christian based) have run stories based on it. So those are the only links available. </p>
<p>Not everything needs a source. When making a decision, like with this vaccine, there are so many factors. For me, it's accumulated knowledge about the side effects, both on VAERs and people's stories, legal issues like there being liability protection, spiritual issues, my own philosophical viewpoints about the role of government, health, and death, how I see the philosophical views and ideology of people pushing this stuff, and a variety of other factors.</p>

        <p>I've also noticed people having wild swings in bad luck. My dad got his shot and his truck broke down. My mom has been bullied by a lady at her job. Numerous fb friends also asking for prayers but not going into details about what's going on which is weird since they were very candid about their lives in the past.</p>

        <p>Now that's interesting. You ever heard that rumor that the music industry has a whole floor dedicated to doing satanic rituals over the finished copy of an album, before taking it for mass production? I always picture something similar going on with this injection.</p>
<p>There are 2 parts to this world, both equally important: The spiritual and the material. The left side of the brain deals in the material, reasoning, etc. The right side deals with spirituality and emotions. Some people are left brain imbalanced and some are right brain imbalanced. </p>
<p>When discussing the injection, whether the person is pro or against it, I see one common theme: Left brain imbalance. The data, the statistics, the biological processes. Yes, those things are important. But it's an imbalanced viewpoint if the right brain isn't involved. </p>
<p>We also have some right brain imbalanced individuals too. When you can't get through to someone with data, and you don't know why, you probably have a right brainer. They can't believe that the authorities would lie and hurt people. They have  unlimited trust for government. Their reasons are emotional and no amount of information will change that. The need to "fit in" and not be rejected by society is a right brain mechanism. </p>
<p>I learned this from Mark Passio. He was a priest in the Church of Satan and took what he learned to inform people about what the elite satanists are really about. But he goes into other knowledge about true freedom and natural law. I'm a huge fan of his work.</p>

        <p>It's actually the cult of Saturn also known as The Order of The Black Sun. Yes I'm very aware of the music industry casting spells on the "master". From my knowledge they're still doing it till this day.</p>
<p>Everything in this world is Satanic but not necessarily in the biblical sense. You have two dueling aspects, you have positive aspect of Saturn, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism (Torah) and negative aspects, Satanism, Talmudic Judaism, Atheism, etc.</p>
<p>The key is to remove yourself from all the "isms" and just be. All of the isms pander the false self, the ego.</p>
<p>Easier said than done, lol.</p>

        <p>Here’s the thing. You don’t need a source to know that water is wet and grass is green. If you have any common sense it’s very easy to discern the truth from a lie. That’s why I never ask for a source and I’ll never give one. The people asking for one are mostly disingenuous.</p>

        <p>Plan of Action for Resistance:</p>
<p>Judging by the posts here these past few days, I think it's safe to say we are all growing anxious and more sure of retaliation as we are witnessing the demise of liberty across the globe. Here's what has happened in the past few days that has caused this "red alert", and my plan of action for our resistance.</p>
<p>France has set the tone for Europe and likely the rest of the West that vaccine passports will be mandatory to participate in civil society. Yeah, they plan to lock us out of bars, gyms, restaurants, but think of the effects of this years down the line. These governments will eventually prevent us from participating in all levels of democratic governance- we will not be able to participate in, or more significantly, run in elections, have our opinions heard, or be represented in Western government. We will not be allowed in voting facilities, we will not be allowed to seek an audience with those in power. And once this is done, they will certainly turn on us.</p>
<p>Three leaders of three nations who were some of, if not the only, leaders to oppose vaccinations have been assassinated. Haiti, Tanzania, Madagascar. All of their deaths are shrouded with mystery, and the literal only think linking them together was their refusal to import the vaccine to their people.</p>
<p>We literally know that the VACCINE DOES NOT EVEN WORK. It does not prevent you from getting Covid, it does not prevent you from spreading Covid. It is also known that this vaccine is ineffective against "variants", and with each serious mutation, booster shots will probably be required. Additionally, there are certainly many cases of adverse side effects killing otherwise healthy people. J&amp;J has had to issue a warning that their vaccine may cause a severe neural disorder. Pfizer had to retract their vaccine a few months ago for a short period of time. We also know that ALL of these companies have been involved in corrupt practices over the years - putting toxic ingredients in their formulas and coercing doctors to recommend it to their patients. Nothing has changed. For a vaccine that 1. doesn't work and 2. has serious side effects for at least a significant amount of people, there sure is a lot of pressure to get absolutely every human being to take it no matter how at risk they are to COVID. We all know this is suspicious.</p>
<p>The media and big tech are not even hiding their agenda anymore. They are deliberately utilizing "newspeak" - a phenomena I recommend you look into from the novel 1984 in which the talking heads speak in incredibly simple and repetitive terms, in unison, and blatantly contradict their narratives without anyone noticing. If the viewers do notice that they have told a lie, they are convinced that the are wrong. It is crazy listening to people on CNN, Psaki, Biden - they simply lie through their teeth and make shit up and do not think about it because they know for certain the media will back them. It does not matter what they say or do because the media will tell you what to think. Twitter is also blatantly a CCP tool. None of the hashtags are organic, and if god-forbid a republican hashtag should trend, twitter will immediately send in the bots to hijack the newsfeed and send their soyboy responses to the headlines. Seriously, next liberal hashtag you see, go through a few of the profiles participating. You will see they are nearly all bots. And if you have any doubts about point 4, just look to how Twitter and the media handled the Cuba riots. They simply labelled it as a protest to get more vaccines. What?! Guys - our media is literally on the side of tyrannical communism. China.</p>
<p>Biden has announced he hopes to have "civil groups" go door to door to coerce people into getting a vaccination. Holy fucking shit. He either 1. knows EXACTLY who is and is not vaccinated, or 2. knows how to find you. This is serious. We are in trouble. The deep state, all the information conglomerates, and the federal government are all ready to be mobilized against us. I fear that this sub will not last much longer, and once removed, we will face a serious lack of organizational strength.</p>
<p>Luckily, we heave each other. We are not alone, and we are not nearly as isolated and outnumbered as the media would like us to think. Half of Americans have at least not received their second shot. roughly 30% have straight up said no. Many who have, regret their choice and only did because they were coerced. Many others who have were probably elderly and "at risk". Our numbers, in reality, are formidable.</p>
<p>What needs to happen before things go out of control, fast, is we need to set up an organizational system. We need information, and we need ways of communication. I am volunteering to work on the informational side of things if you all can work together to set up a system of communication to persevere should this community go dark. And even if it doesn't, we need an effective way to sow doubt and distrust to the general public. They need to hear what we have to say.</p>
<p>Here is my call to arms:</p>
<p>I am asking all of you to spend roughly fifteen minutes digging up news articles and scientific or otherwise scholarly articles about the events that took place this past year. From the outbreak, to the 2020 election, to today and everything in between. Show me inconsistencies. Show me things that have been proven false. Show me their lies. Show me the truth in as many forms as possible. It is my goal to compile the narrative into a neat treatise, similar to Thomas Paine's "Common Sense". We'll call it "Critical Thinking".</p>
<p>The time to move is now. DM "demsareboughtbyccp" what you find. Thank you and God Bless.</p>

        <p>Nothing wrong with asking for sources if you want to be taken seriously. Most people still got shit to do, even in the pandemic. Everybody can’t spend their time scouring the internet all day. Even when someone provides the source due diligence still needs to be done, which means spending time vetting that source. </p>
<p>Nothing more will damage this sub than people believing some click bait then sharing it to social media where it will then (rightly) be picked apart. We ought not just go believing anything, that’s just as bad as the COVID vaxxers listening to government / Big Pharma.</p>

        <p>Yup, I'm past that now.  I insult them, laugh, downvote and move on.</p>
<p>Shills are a waste of time. People who are genuine will make an effort to find out for themselves. It's far too common now, there is no point.</p>

        <p>It's amazing how they throw shit at the wall and hope it sticks. </p>
<p>I mean look at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/ok1w7u/my_niece_got_the_shot_for_her_12th_birthday/h55ywpp?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">this</a>,</p>
<p>Really, I think we're persuading them deep down, but that inner child and ego comes out in tears in whatever way it can. It's normal for these shills to feel deeply and emotionally, wouldn't be surprised if many cry at night. It's a little heart breaking they've already been double vax jabbed (their psyche protects them). </p>
<p>Once somebody has been vaccinated, no doctor can remove the injection. It's sad, like a ticking time bomb of impeding gloomy doom for these mushy emotional minds.</p>
