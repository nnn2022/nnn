    <strong>Holding The UK Media Accountable</strong>
    <p><p>I keep seeing UK articles pushing the safety of inoculation for pregnant women whilst referencing some large US study that apparently proves it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-57840159">Covid unlocking risk for pregnant women, say doctors - BBC News</a> </p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/16/pregnant-women-offered-covid-vaccine-uk">Pregnant women in UK given green light to have Covid jab | Coronavirus | The Guardian</a> </p>
<p>Both articles mention a 90,000 person study in US.</p>
<p>The Guardian article states;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; All pregnant women would be offered the Pfizer or Moderna jab based on their age and clinical risk group after real-world data from the US showed about <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafepregnancyregistry.html">90,000 pregnant women had been vaccinated</a> without any safety concerns, the UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) said on Friday. </p>
<p>The link in the excerpt is the following; <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafepregnancyregistry.html">Vaccine Pregnancy Registry | CDC</a> </p>
<p>The study here notes people enrolled through a CDC app called V-Safe where they self-report issues.</p>
<p>On July 12th 2021 the total number was 113,466 people reported as pregnant and having received vaccination. </p>
<p>On July 12th 2021 the total number was 5,103 (of those 113,466) people actually enrolled in V-Safe (i.e. fulfilling all eligibility criteria). </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; Among 827 participants who had a completed pregnancy, the pregnancy resulted in a live birth in 712 (86.1%), in a spontaneous abortion in 104 (12.6%), in stillbirth in 1 (0.1%), and in other outcomes (induced abortion and ectopic pregnancy) in 10 (1.2%). A total of 96 of 104 spontaneous abortions (92.3%) occurred before 13 weeks of gestation (<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2104983#"><strong>Table 4</strong></a>), and 700 of 712 pregnancies that resulted in a live birth (98.3%) were among persons who received their first eligible vaccine dose in the third trimester. Adverse outcomes among 724 live-born infants — including 12 sets of multiple gestation — were preterm birth (60 of 636 among those vaccinated before 37 weeks [9.4%]), small size for gestational age (23 of 724 [3.2%]), and major congenital anomalies (16 of 724 [2.2%] </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>The limitations of the study are clearly noted, excerpt below;</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; We were unable to evaluate adverse outcomes that might occur in association with exposures earlier in pregnancy, such as congenital anomalies, because no pregnant persons who were vaccinated early in pregnancy have had live births captured in the v-safe pregnancy registry to date; follow-up is ongoing. In addition, the proportion of pregnant persons who reported spontaneous abortion may not reflect true postvaccination proportions because participants might have been vaccinated after the period of greatest risk in the first trimester, and very early pregnancy losses might not be recognized. Whereas some pregnancies with vaccination in the first and early second trimester have been completed, the majority are ongoing, and a direct comparison of outcomes on the basis of timing of vaccination is needed to define the proportion of spontaneous abortions in this cohort. Because of sample-size constraints, both pregnancy and neonatal outcomes were calculated as a proportion instead of a rate. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So, we don't have a 90,000 (or 113,466) person study showing the vaccines are safe for pregnant women.... we actually have a 5,103-person study showing they have no fucking idea if the vaccines are safe for pregnant women because it hasn't been running long enough for many of the pregnant women to give birth.</p></p>

        <p>Pregnant women are told not to eat deli meat because there miiiiiight be contamination that could harm the baby... but getting an experimental gene therapy shot is encouraged and applauded. Same goes with breastfeeding mothers... dont eat broccoli it might give the baby gas pains... but do get your covid jab it's safe and effective!!</p>
