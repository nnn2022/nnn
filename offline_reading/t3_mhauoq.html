    <strong>Who's really the conspiracy theorist</strong>
    <p><p>I've been thinking about this..</p>
<p>Why are we the conspiracy theorist/wappies if there's more proof it's a scam than proof it's a real dangerous virus?</p>
<p>Shouldn't we be calling the doomers conspiracy theorist/wappie? , They are afraid of a virus with a recovery rate of 99,8% and they are the ones that can't really proof it's dangerous and they are the ones that come up with lies and excuses to proof their point, who is really the conspiracy theorist/wappie?</p>
<p>The one that ignores the truth  or the one that accept the truth ?.</p></p>

        <p>The secret planners have secret plans.  Our world leaders plan in secret and have secret plans.  That is not a theory; it is certain.   They have also trained people to discredit and dismiss anyone who guesses/theorizes at what their secret plans are, without even evaluating the plausibility of the theory.  </p>
<p>It doesn't help that some wildly implausible conspiracy theories have been used to give conspiracy theorists at large a bad name.</p>

        <p>Ima tell you like this. You wanting to be informed and questing for truth does not make you a conspiracy theorist, it makes you human.</p>
<p><em>Here is an example and I hope you catch my drift;</em></p>
<p>Youtube wants to censor dislikes on Biden's videos. The people who voted for <em>Mr. "Most Votes Ever" Biden</em> are uninterested in politics, and don't pay attention. <em>Otherwise they would counteract the downvotes.</em> Since those people don't exist (or remain uninterested) Youtube has to alter reality to fit the agenda.</p>

        <p>I think there are people telling the truth and people lying on both sides. What it's turned into is more of a government vs. anti-government argument, stretching the facts about the virus to appeal to one's own political agenda.</p>
<p>You are the ones called the conspiracy theorists because you go against the government. Whether that is a good thing or a bad thing is dependent on your political perspective. </p>
<p>There are valid arguments for protecting oneself from the virus, although there are also equally valid arguments that lockdown rules can harm people. It's a multifaceted problem that needs to be explored on all fronts/perspectives, not simplified to a political opinion such as "I support the government" or "I don't support the government" because there really is no single right answer. That's why echo chambers can be dangerous because they lead to far-left or far-right or far-government or far-antigovernment beliefs which hurt society's response to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

        <p>Nah, the measures taken to "reduce the spread" had little at best evidence when they were enacted and have proven a failure in practice. That's not a political thing.</p>
<p>Edit: also have caused way more collateral harm than even the first projections said they would have prevented in Covid harms.</p>

        <p>Yes I agree it's not even a political thing and it has nothing to do with being pro government or anti government, I actually know people that are pro government but are skeptical about this pandemic or know it's a scam, I think it has nothing to do with being pro government or anti government, I could be pro government but still criticize their actions.</p>

        <p>Well if you believe that it is a "scam" then you are basically assuming that your government is lying to you to take away your rights, because why else would they require everyone to wear a mask if it didn't help the people? Or is there another reason I am missing? Most of the people from this subreddit who are against masks and the vaccine are also against the government taking away individuals' rights.</p>

        <p>But i never said they are always lying because sometimes government spill out the truth about the virus, mask, vaccine etc but then people just ignore it and even when you show government evidence they call you a conspiracy theorist for a information that criticizes pandemic, mask, lockdown, vaccine, etc.</p>

        <p>But if there is also evidence that masks work, i.e. there is an opposition, then the topic drifts away from the scientific realm and enters the political realm where you can have an opinion that isn't inherently right or wrong.</p>
<p>It's definitely a political thing when 95% of the people in this subreddit also hold anti-government beliefs, it isn't a mere coincidence.</p>
