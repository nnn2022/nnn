        <p>Thatâ€™s a dumb take. Coronaviruses are around us and it takes days for us to know if a person got infected. However, Ebola is very aggressive and it starts destroying your body right after you get infected. Also, thereâ€™s no Ebola epidemic in the Western World.</p>

        <p>actually, covid can stick to the surface of an object if you cough or exhale without a mask, germ and virus such as corona can fly and stick into an object and survive for a few days, and if someone touches that object and then they put their hand in their faces, for example, eating without washing their hand they could get covid</p>

        <p>Are you hearing YOURSELF? </p>
<p>I've been in a cult before as an unwilling child. I know what they're like personally. You are speaking only through hearsay, academically. You probably should stay in your lane. That also applies to talking about our country, because it's clear that you don't understand the beauty of the freedom we have in this glorious country either. </p>
<p>Again, you're the brainwashed person, living like a drone, at the behest of your masters, bowing on command, and doing their every bidding. I'm the one who says "hell no!", and defies the controlling masters' narrative. The latter is the literal opposite of "cult behavior", so again, stick to something you know, which clearly isn't cults, the USA, or how to live a free and happy life.</p>

<p>you have literally been brainwash to think the USA is the best country in the world</p>

        <p>Just the fact that you equate loving one's country to doing whatever said country's political leaders say, shows what a difference we have in what we value in a country, and shines a light on the kind of existence you live in.</p>
<p>Again, freedom trumps all. You don't have the US Constitution. You lose.</p>

<p>Why are you people who come in to troll so obsessed with Trump? I rarely think of the guy, and don't even want him to run for President again! Many in this particular sub don't even like the guy, and never voted for him! Yet, people are constantly coming in here, and after getting nowhere with their terrible attempts at argumentation, just throw out some dig at Trump, like it'll hurt our feelings. We don't even care about Trump that much anymore, so you're barking up the wrong tree here! lol</p>

        <p>Thank you for the source, it's always refreshing to see someone actually back up their claim with the actual information that they read.</p>
<p>However, I am inclined to believe you did not even read that article. The title literally says masks pose more of a risk 'if worn improperly', and the article elaborates that those who have not yet learned proper mask etiquette are more inclined to touch their face often which is where the risk comes from, not from the mask itself. It also elaborates on why they wanted people to stop buying masks at the time, which was because they were afraid health care providers would be unable to obtain any, and while masks are useful for everyone they are much more necessary for health care providers.</p>
<p>And despite all that, that article is a year old at this point and we have learned more about the effectiveness of masks. Since you shared a CNN link, I assume it's a news site that you trust.</p>
<p>https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/09/health/face-mask-guidance-coronavirus-wellness/index.html</p>
<p>This article outlines that masks are indeed effective.</p>

        <p>Sorry! Looks like I confused you a bit, I tried to keep it brief but I know it can be difficult to keep track sometimes.</p>
<p>Did you see the part where I provided a direct quote from the Surgeon General from the article? That was a really important part of my comment, you should go back and read it again. If you still can't see it let me know and I'm happy to give you a hand. </p>
<p>I'm working right now so I don't have time to fully explain, but please do some reading on distinctions without differences, I think you'll learn a lot. Whether people don't wear masks effectively or the masks are not effective, the end result is the same. </p>
<p>It almost seems like government bodies flip flop back and forth on a regular basis and warp data to suit what they want to say hey? We were supposed to wear masks, not wear them, wear them again, maybe wear two masks, cancel mask mandates, get the vaccine but still wear masks maybe. </p>
<p>The fact that it's so ambiguous and can't be proven puts the burden of proof on people in your camp. If you want to implement unprecedented measures there should be unprecedented scenarios. </p>
<p>Please try to have at least one critical thought, and I will continue to comprehend everything you attempt to argue.</p>

        <p>The comment he made back in March 2020, back at the beginning of the pandemic in the US when we didn't have as much information as we do now. The comment that specifically was made to prevent the general population from panic buying masks so that health care providers would be able to obtain them and they wouldn't be hoarded like toilet paper. Information changes so quickly because we are rapidly studying and testing new things which provides new evidence which changes how we understand things. Covid is sort of the most important thing in the world right now, the information we had in March 2020 is most certainly not going to be the same as the information we have now.</p>
<p>What do changing mask mandates have to do with masks not being effective? Just because somewhere doesn't want it to be required doesn't mean it's not effective. Just because people are still wearing their masks after getting their vaccine doesn't mean either isn't effective. I feel like it's been pretty consistently said for at least the past few months that if you're unvaccinated, then wearing a mask is the most effective option at your disposal to keep others safe.</p>
<p>Also you just provided a source for your claim yet you're now actively trying to tell me those same sources aren't reliable and I shouldn't listen to them. So should I listen to that Surgeon General quote you provided, or is he another government body who flip flops ambiguous information?</p>

        <p>You illustrate my point perfectly. What I am saying is that we did not have enough information to implement the insane restrictions that the government did, and we still don't. If I see some guy walking down the street and I sort of think he looks sketchy, I'm not going to run up to him and risk my life to beat him to death. I would sit back, gather a bit of info, and then make a decision based on that. I'm not saying it's a crazy conspiracy or intentional or anything. My belief is just that government bungled handling another issue, like they have been shown to do countless times. </p>
<p>I completely agree with your points here and I'm glad we came to an agreement. Government bodies are not the arbiters of truth and are often unreliable. We should also take common sense and global trends into consideration. There is not enough data to justify shutting down the economy and killing untold tens of thousands of people, especially because that has not been shown to help a single person.</p>
<p>I will readily admit I got away a bit from masks specifically there, but I'm phrasing the argument in such a way that masks are a part of a larger issue. To speak on masks specifically, there has been a jumble of data showing they are not effective and just as much data showing that they are effective. I personally don't think government should mandate behavior based on such shaky and unreliable data, but it's completely fine if you don't agree with that.</p>

        <p>I understand wanting more concrete proof for measures as extreme as the ones that were taken, I think that's a point we all agree on, but the only concrete evidence we had of anything at the time was that Covid was spreading very quickly and that for some it was extremely life-disrupting and even very deadly, and that something needed to be done quickly about it and the newest information we had at hand was to use masks, and it was that or do nothing.</p>
<p>Perhaps I have been in a bit of an information bubble, but from my perspective there has been vastly much more evidence that masks work vs evidence that they don't, and I have seen little to no proof that they do any sort of harm. That, coupled with the fact that doctors have been wearing face masks for a very very long time to prevent the spread of germs, and the fact that many Eastern countries have already been wearing masks to help slow the spread of regular airborne spread illnesses, leads me to believe that masks are the safest option. Masks have been used before the Covid pandemic and thus I think we have a decent amount of evidence to back up the fact that they work. As I see it, if masks actually do end up being ineffective then there was no harm in wearing one, but it's hard to justify not wearing one as it's proven that without one you're just going to spread Covid, there's no disputing that. To be blunt here I just have not seen enough information proving masks aren't as effective as they're already said to be. Like I said, maybe I just haven't been exposed to it yet, but I feel like I would've encountered it by now.</p>
<p>I'm not crazy about the government policing people or what they do or what they do to their bodies, I definitely understand why it's something people want to fight against because it can become a slippery slope, but when the general population's health is at stake I find it harder to justify fighting against. I view it very similarly to driving; if somebody wants to participate in society, they need to give up the freedom to do whatever they feel like and follow a certain set of rules to ensure the safety of the people around them.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter if they can't agree that there is even a health or safety issue to begin with.</p>

        <p>I did it - it was bad with the mask on, but it was much worse without the mask at all. I think I inhaled some asbestos too.</p>
