    <strong>Anyone else have too much free time because of the "New Normal"?</strong>
    <p><p>I love leisurely browsing the shelves at my neighborhood supermarkets, and walking from one to the other to find new and exciting things to cook for dinner. I work as a model, so except when I have shoots or art classes I pose for, most of my days are free, and that's my favorite way to spend the day. Under the "New Normal", you're treated like a monster if you do anything but run in, grab your groceries like a panicked animal, and run out. I'm left with huge blocks of time to kill. I have severe depression and generalized anxiety disorder, so this is a major problem: too much time to think. All the gyms are closed, so I can't read books on the treadmill like I used to, and I get nervous sitting at home reading. I love to sew but already tailored every garment in the house due to the glut of time to kill. My husband and I have snazzy clothes now, but nowhere to wear them, ha ha. </p>
<p>Does anyone else have this newly developed problem? I had such a careful routine for managing my depression, and this tanked it. Every day is nothing but time to kill, thanks to "contactless" this and "curbside pickup" that. I spend hours walking around my neighborhood, because that's all I am really allowed to do. Life is such a joyless slog. We're robbed of small moments of delight.</p></p>

        <p>I am someone who thrives with free time/ time to myself but I have a routine to deal with depression and anxiety and now I can’t do any of those things. Like you, I like food shopping leisurely and exercising. I also like having things to look forward to and depend on. Also change is very hard for me. So I’m cool with the free time but I’m with you on most of my coping mechanisms have been taking away. I’m sorry you’re struggling and that the government thinks that’s fine.</p>

        <p>The same people who previously bleated about how important it is to recognize and accommodate mental health issues are showing their true colours with their response to this. The government doesn't care, even friends and family don't care how this is hurting people.</p>

        <p>I’m the same. I had a really active life before this happened but now? No commuting to the office. (Even though saving on gas is good, at least.) Can’t go figure skating. No baseball games to work or see. No gyms. No nail salons. No in-person Masses. No going out to eat, even alone. I see all my friends enjoying the free time they’ve gotten and having fun with their families, and although I’ve seen family in person during this, I just get nothing out of being at home constantly and I have a hard time motivating myself to nurture hobbies or start a new side gig. </p>
<p>And we all know when things do come back there will be all new rules that will make sure life is still miserable.</p>

        <p>You could be my bff--ice skating and baseball games are two of my favorite activities! I'm missing both along with the gym and Mass and Confession, and I'm also incredibly annoyed that outdoor movies are cancelled for the summer. I'm single and my family all live in other states 500 or more miles away. It's been somewhat sad to be alone at home so much, though I do love my dogs.</p>

        <p>I have 4 kids under 6 at home so I  still busy but we don’t have much fun right now.  It is pretty much my husband and I trying to keep them from killing each other each day. With no school, camps, play dates, etc there are some LONG days.</p>
<p>I really feel bad for my mom though- my dad passed very unexpectedly 6 weeks ago. I take my kids over all the time but she is just stuck at the house so often. Her favorite time waster activity is something she calls “cheap shopping”. Basically just looking for really good deals on various things. We are in Texas do stores are open but with lines to get in, many people in masks, and social distancing (of course)she doesn’t really enjoy it right now. She said it is just sad to be out with all the people so damn scared. She (and my dad) were against the lockdown since the beginning (she is 70) because they were taking away our rights. </p>
<p>She would also like to start volunteering to fill some time but almost no groups are taking new volunteers right now in case they are infected. It is just so annoying. Add to this the fact that we were not allowed have a small funeral for my dad but now not even a month later protesters are going to huge memorial services for Mr Floyd really upsets her. They were married for 50 years- she just seems lost right now. She needs to find her new life and social group and all these dumb rules are making that very difficult.</p>

        <p>My heart breaks for your mom (and the many like her out there). She's lost her husband, and isn't even allowed small pleasures to make herself feel human. Not getting a proper funeral and seeing these massive memorial services must hurt her on such a deep level.</p>

        <p>I suppose it’s a little different since I’m living in a state that’s opened up. Just went to my first outdoor small concert yesterday, and it was like being in drugs, surrounded by that many people at once. I’m also able to go to the gym and do regular shopping.</p>
<p>I take my time in stores, and have from the beginning. I refuse to act like some criminal who is doing something wrong. I’m giving you my money, and I will not be punished for it. If anyone were to approach and confront me over this, I would gladly tell them to fuck off. </p>
<p>I pick up products and touch them and put them back, if I’m not interested in buying them. Today I went to the grocery store and smelled the candles because I fucking wanted to.</p>
<p>Anyone who has a problem with this is free to order their groceries online, disinfect them feverishly when they arrive, and whatever other nonsense they feel is appropriate. I’m done sacrificing my inner peace so people can feel safe.</p>

        <p>I'm incredibly shy and passive, and I'm trying to work up the chutzpah to do this, as it will be the only thing keeping me from going completely mad. Very grateful that I live in a Japanese neighborhood (and in the required mask, I pass as Japanese), so no one's overly dickish. Weirdly, no one in the Japanese markets is that freaked out about the 'Rona. It's always a relief to see people not wearing those ridiculous surgical gloves and slippers, spraying down the carts with THEIR Windex, as the store's can't possibly protect them from the scary, scary virus. At Ralph's, I honestly saw a lady Windex her Starbucks drink.</p>
<p>I seriously miss my gym!</p>

        <p>Same, though mine wasn’t a full layoff, just I can’t resume work until we can return to the office. My return to the office date keeps getting pushed back, and since it’s an internship I’m getting more concerned that they’re just gonna bag it at this point.</p>

        <p>I do. I am working full-time (not from home, thank God) but work is slow and dull. I am trying to add some new activities to my routine but on date where my depression kicks in, it’s hard not to be able to be like, ok, I’m gonna force myself out of the house and just window shop or do something spontaneous. I didn’t realize how much small things, like browsing at the grocery store after work or being able to make random dinner plans with a friend helped energize me when I was feeling low. Most of my nights I go straight home from work and didn’t leave the house at all this weekend (my state has very strict restrictions). It’s not emotionally healthy.</p>

        <p>I tried that a few weeks ago, and kept encountering people giving the death stare to anyone hiking without a mask and gloves. (This is Los Angeles, so locals really love getting to virtue signal!) Just stressful and disheartening. The trails have been open for a while now, so hopefully, I can hike in peace again. Thanks for the idea!</p>
