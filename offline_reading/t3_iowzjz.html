    <strong>Please talk me off the ledge</strong>
    <p><p>I'm trying not to cry at work. I get a call this morning my sons private school is cancelled.  Our public is doing 2 days hybrid, which is worthless and we make too much to even get a chromebook.
My job emailed that the earliest they will open is January 2021. I'm furloughed but I don't know now what will happen.
I became a parent so my child could have a better life than I did. Now there is no possibility of that, at all. 
I really just wish I were dead. I cant do this anymore. I'm crying at work. I'm almost a 40 year old woman.</p></p>

        <p>I understand where you are at. Different circumstances, but I'm around the same age, with a school age kid, and living in this nightmare is not what I want for him or me. Few people seem to have any sympathy for those of us having our lives torn up over the response to the pandemic and its incredibly frustrating. Why can no one seem to acknowledge the actual costs being extracted from us? I am tired of being made to feel like I am the one who is going insane because I didn't happily sign up to throw away my previous life.</p>
<p>You're doing all you can for your child, and I know that will serve him well no matter what the outcome is. There is just a lot to deal with right now, and we have very little control over what happens to us. It's beyond frustrating. </p>
<p>I've struggled with depression most of my life, and many times during the last six months I have honestly just wished I would not have to wake up again in this absolute disaster. But I do, and I keep dragging myself around when there's no motivation to do so.</p>
<p>I wish I could help you to be strong, but the only thing I can think to say is "don't panic". Platitudes of "hang in there!" just don't cut it anymore. But don't panic. Work the problem in front of you. And then the next one. One at a time. You can't put a puzzle together all at once--you have to organize and find a place to start. </p>
<p>In other words: you have to figure out what is solvable right now. You can't change what will happen with your employment as it stands, so that's out of your control unless you change jobs. Do your best with the options for school. There's limited choice out there right now across the board. Assuming you can't instantly uproot your life and move somewhere else, can you afford to homeschool for a year? If you can't, is there a way you can make public school work (even knowing it will be awful for the time being)? Can you make limited changes to the job you are working right now in order to make the transition easier, like taking more work for the money, or working less to help your son handle hybrid school?</p>
<p>I don't know what your situation is, and you don't have to answer any of that to me. Just try to take it one bit at a time. Shelve what can't be helped right now and don't take it down until you can do something about it. The way things are right now, January is a thousand years away and we don't know what the hell it'll be like. And stay alive.</p>

        <p>You’re doing more of a favor to your child and the future of humanity just by being against the “new normal,” than these poor children being raised in masks by parents beholden to the media. Stay true to your heart. Trust and have faith in your core beliefs and you’re on the right path.</p>

        <p>I'm so sad for my 8th grade son. He asked two of his friends over this weekend. They both ridiculed him, in texts telling him, "... have to stay 6 feet apart...I don't want to get Corona...haven't you heard, bro?!!" along with some stupid gifs. It bothers me more than him. He's an only child and misses socializing. He just said, "Mom, it's not their fault. It's what their parents are telling them."</p>

        <p>That is soo sad. My poor 15 year old babysitter has the same problem.  She's become very depressed and actually looks forward to "hanging out" with my 6 year old. (Hired her in March so they could both have some sort of social interaction, she's my best friends kid).</p>

        <p>I’m an 18 year old guy, so while I can’t relate to being a parent, I totally understand what you are going through. I lost my senior year of HS, my senior tennis season, graduation (I was ranked top 5 in my class) and my senior prom. My college announced that the fall tennis season was cancelled, and that everyone needed a covid test. Masks everywhere. I’d had enough. My senior year of high school was ruined, and I wasn’t going to let my freshman year of college be taken down too. I deferred for a year. Planned on keeping working my job at a trampoline park and saving money. A week later, they closed. Couldn’t survive in this economy. So here I am, staying home for another year. I had a job interview this morning. 2 of my closest friends were sent home from college after a week and are already back in town, so I think my decision was good. I’m proud of the fact that I avoided the panic and hysteria of college. I didn’t give them my money this year. But 2020 still sucks, and has been the roughest year I’ve been through.</p>
<p>The lockdowns have hurt EVERYONE. You aren’t alone. This isn’t your fault. This isn’t our fault. It’s our leaders- our mayors and governors, who have done this to us. What I’ve done is directed my frustration at anyone responsible for the lockdowns. My friends and I are all registered to vote against any pro-lockdown officials. We hang out and just vent about how bad our world has gotten. I’m done with being silent on social media. We’re going to have to fight for our lives back. Are there any businesses near you that are anti-mask? Visit them. Any anti-lockdown protests? Go and hang out with like minded people. But please do not harm yourself. That would be giving into the people in power who are responsible for this. They want to break us. They want us to give up our freedoms for a false sense of safety. Find a way to get through this, that’s what this sub and others like it is for. And eventually, things will get better, evil people will be defeated, and it will all be worth it. And your son will grow up in a better world.</p>

        <p>I am so sorry. No matter your age, you are justified in grieving your very real losses and for your children. This lockdown has been so evil for so many, and will hurt our children for decades.  </p>

        <p>This, too, shall pass.</p>
<p>My wife and daughter are wrestling with the sadness as well. Here are some things I will suggest, which helps them.</p>
<p>First and foremost, remember your child. It is my firm opinion that the school systems are failing them. If you are furloughed, then you have the power to take matters into your own hands. I strongly recommend looking into homeschooling, so that you can keep them from falling behind. There are plenty of sites and programs that develop curriculum - you aren’t on your own. You may even be able to get with a community of like-minded parents and get some of the kids together responsibly.</p>
<p>Second, remember that as the parable says, this is only a moment in time. You still have many blessings. Reflect upon them.</p>
<p>Third, even though circumstance has changed, you still have power over what you do with those circumstances. Worried about your job? Now is a great time to look for a remote gig. Consider getting some more training, or even going back to school online. Perhaps you could put together a side hustle, slinging things on EBay. And there are still plenty of volunteer opportunities to give your day some meaning.</p>
<p>Lastly, mix it up. Summer is almost over. Get outside, take a walk, take the kids to the park, take a drive through the hills, whatever. Try cooking a new dish, or playing a new card game, growing a garden. Or maybe paint a room, fix the broken gate, or otherwise bring order to some minor chaos in your life.</p>
<p>The worst thing you can feel is powerless. The best way to reverse that is to take some action. Sitting in front of a screen reading about things you can’t control doesn’t really help, if you get me.</p>

        <p>How are you so sure?  Even bad times present opportunities, if you're positioned to take them.  Teach him to take advantage of the bad times as well as the good, and to use his moral principles to spot opportunities others aren't taking.  If you can, teach him to do something valuable that can be done independently - doesn't really matter what it is, just as long as it's something that "someone has to do" no matter what and that doesn't depend on a corporate paymaster.</p>

        <p>Speaking to that, I heard someone put it perfectly when this whole thing started: "Bad for capitalism, good for the soul."</p>
<p>For many, this gives a socially acceptable excuse to slow down the rat race. Conspicuous spending is down, saving is up, and the crowding - from roads to workplaces to shopping - is all eased up. Introverts like myself aren't particularly bothered by it either, which makes for a lot of consternation from extroverts.</p>
<p>We are being challenged right now to find ways to fill such social gaps consumerism has left us with. Taking your kids to play on the McDonald's playground or puttering away at your laptop at Starbucks is out, so what now? It's a conundrum, especially for those who wilt with a lack of social interaction.</p>
<p>I don't know what your situation is, but the trick my family and I are finding is to have small get-togethers with neighbors and relatives, appreciating nature, and focusing on self-improvement via education and exercise. It is hard, but it's what we can do for now.</p>

<p>Oh my goodness, that sounds awful. I'm so sorry that you're going through those struggles.</p>
<p>If your insurance won't cover the cost of a therapist while your furloughed then I suggest checking out a support site like <a href="https://7cups.com">7cups.com</a>. In addition to paid therapists, they have free volunteer listeners that you can chat with.</p>
<p>You can also text a Crisis line at 741741 in the US or UK. You'll be matched with a volunteer counselor, who is supervised by a licensed, trained mental health professional.</p>
<p>And, of course, you call the US National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.</p>

        <p>I have been thinking of you all day.  </p>
<p>I don’t know if this gives you comfort, but it’s the truth: “security” has always been an illusion. <em>If</em> you are lucky enough to accumulate a big fat 401K and wealth, these things still depend on the status quo being present decades from now, which is not a historically reliable metric to happen.   </p>
<p>I too am grieving for the loss of my home on the West Coast. All my wealth is tied up in blue states and I’m terrified that it’s about to be worthless. But really - all that has always been an illusion dependent on a number of factors remaining the same.  </p>
<p>“Now” is what counts. You are not on the streets. You are not starving. You still have your family, and hopefully, your health. What you have lost is your beloved community and, along with it, your sense of identity among your community. And your faith in those who you have loved all your life is crushed. You are faced with the very real prospect that you may have to make a choice between freedom and holding onto these ties.   </p>
<p>As hard as it sounds, try to focus on what you do have now. Take happiness in your children’s smiles. Make time to homeschool them and teach them the virtues of liberty. If you’re ever in danger of being evicted or going hungry, reach out to me.  </p>
<p>There <em>is</em> a future ahead for you and your family. It may not be in Rochester, but there is one.</p>

        <p>i'm so sorry to hear this today, and while i'm not in your situation, please know that i would literally chop off my pinkie so that you and your son didn't have to go through this. no parent should have to go through what the moms and dads and little ones are dealing with right now.</p>
<p>i don't have kids, so i can't give you much advice or tell you what to do. you know your son best, and it's obvious to every asshole on this subreddit that you care deeply about your child and his future, and even if we're assholes, we care about you and respect you and we're sorry you're going through this. i know you're making the best choices for you and your family. unfortunately all of the choices are hard and not great.</p>
<p>all i can do is offer a good shoulder to cry on, open DMs, lots of red wine, and chocolate. never hesitate to reach out.</p>
<p>perfect is the enemy of good enough. go to war with the army you have, not the one you want. you're doing just fine. it has to get better (i don't know when or how, but time only goes one way). you are more than enough.</p>
