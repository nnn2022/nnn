        <p>Prince William and Kate are also not wearing masks here!

<p>I also saw Keanu Reeves and his girlfriend grabbing dinner in Berlin without face masks in hand and the article said they were there meeting fellow castmates from the Matrix 4 for dinner.  </p>
<p>When I saw this I was like "are you f-ing me? we are only dealing with this insanity in the US?!"</p>

        <p>I'm in the UK. Could I get some clarification from those of you in the US: are a lot of cities and regions now requiring mask-wearing everywhere?</p>
<p>Here it's only mandated by the government on public transport and in hospitals and health centres. Individual businesses are free to ask customers to wear masks but virtually none are doing so. They are instead having employees wear them.</p>
<p>Those who are paranoid and staunchly pro-lockdown tend to shame others for not adhering to social distancing, but not so much for not wearing masks, because it's largely seen as a personal choice (I would say, anecdotally, that on the streets of London only 1 in 20 people wear them at most).</p>

        <p>See your required places make sense. Public transport has always been a Petri dish and hospitals is common sense. </p>
<p>And it’s piecemeal by state (sometimes by city), but where most people live yes masks are being pushed VERY hard and most social media is people saying those who don’t wear masks EVERYWHERE are murderers</p>

        <p>I think this page is accurate on what mandates as happening where and what the details are:
https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/19/us/states-face-mask-coronavirus-trnd/index.html</p>
<p>Some of the mandates include wearing masks at all times even outside while some are indoor only.  I don't think any states are doing it the way you described the UK is doing it where it is only public transportation or hospitals/clinics.</p>
<p>There are also people reporting businesses for not enforcing these mandates in high numbers with restaurants receiving negative reviews for doing this.  There are a lot of social justice warriors who jumped on this opportunity to enforce their brand of moral righteousness.</p>
<p>There is no personal choice in those states with these mandates here.  A guy in Oregon was told he could not be in court for his traffic violation without a mask and because he has breathing issues he told them he would leave.  The judge then arrested him for leaving before he was dismissed.  Stuff like this is happening here.  I honestly don't understand why this is happening only here nor do I understand why when I chart confirmed cases and pick a bunch of random countries to chart along with the US the US is only country that is going up dramatically.  Biologically this does not make a lot of sense given we all locked down around the same time, had similar exposures etc.  I feel like there is something significantly wrong or different that we are doing in characterization of what constitutes a confirmed case.  That or our PCR testing methodologies are gravely off.  Or... many other possible explanations which I've seen posted all over social media.</p>

        <p>The US covers a vast geographical area so although everyone locked down simultaneously, not every state/county had the same level of lockdown and community spread of the virus was not evenly distributed at the time of lockdown.</p>
<p>The US also has a lot of internal movement -- people moving between states for work, to visit relatives, or whatever. These factors mean that looking at national averages paints a very incomplete picture because in truth different things are happening in different parts.</p>
<p>I remember very early on seeing predictions that while the spread in places like NY would be more or less in sync with places like, say, London, other parts of the US would significantly lag behind.</p>
<p>However, your point about testing methodologies varying wildly by country/region is correct. Confirmed cases as a comparative measure is very crude and inexact. Firstly, some places now have much higher testing capacity than others, so an increase in positive results may notreflect an increase in actual infections.</p>
<p>This happened in the UK where in late May/early June, they finally made testing available to everyone with symptoms (whereas before, only health &amp; care workers and some other essential workers were eligible). People freaked out about upticks in confirmed cases, but other numbers (hospitalisations, fatalities, etc.) showed a consistent downward decline.</p>
<p>Also in the UK, the government has now admitted to botching some of the stats that were previously reported. Some test results were actually double-counted -- shit like that. Meanwhile countries like Spain used to exclude care home cases from their official tally (not sure if that has been corrected since). In short: comparisons must absolutely be taken with a grain of salt!</p>

        <p>I'm seeing stories regularly come through now about the inconsistencies in defining what is a "confirmed case" that vary widely from city to state to county to country.  It is making it hard to compare any data at all because the lack of consistency means no one is on the same page. </p>
<p>I have also seen multiple stories come through about double counting or adding in those with antibodies to the confirmed cases though I am unsure where or who is doing this.  It makes all of this so unreliable yet we are making decisions based on uncertainty.</p>
<p>I couldn't imagine hedging bets based on a guess of a count of something.</p>

        <p>It varies by state.  In my state you're required to wear a mask inside buildings.  So grocery stories, any time you go shopping, whatever.  Bars/restaurants are slightly excepted; you're expected to wear your mask when walking to your table or when you get up to go to the bathroom, but when you're sitting down to eat (or if you're sitting at the bar) you can remove your mask.  Employees of the restaurant, however, are expected to wear their masks at all times.  I imagine these rules are applied on public transportation too but I rarely use it and haven't since the rules went into effect.</p>

        <p>People are hypocrites.  It makes me happy seeing people act normal.  If they start demanding other people wear masks though and refuse to wear one themselves, then they deserve criticism.</p>

        <p>If the Pope leaned conservative they would have made a big deal of it.  Remember, there is a culture in the media that specifically will select different narratives on the same event and frame it based on who is involved.  Search for sources you can trust, because the mainstream media is not it.</p>
