    <strong>We must have empathy for those that are afraid to live…</strong>
    <p><p>They can’t conceive that a life of contentment and satisfaction is possible. They have never experienced how rewarding it can be to live a full life. They are afraid to die because they know there is more to life… but they don’t know how to find it. They don’t realize that they are free beings in the eyes of whatever made us and that they can just choose not to live in fear. They are beaten down and conditioned to behave like slaves unconscious of their bondage.</p>
<p>We must have empathy and compassion for them. When we stand up, we must offer our hand to lift them up as well. Show them that there is nothing to be afraid of. Life is a gift but it is dependent on our participation… with our bodies AND our souls. Many of them were already withered and despondent and in need of something to believe in. Be that something for them when you can. Show them that there is more out there than their power hungry keepers would have them believe. That is the reason that you post here, is it not? To shine light on the eminent encroachment on your Natural Right to be a willful being?</p>
<p>A life well lived is the greatest reward on earth. You can enrich yours by lifting up the downtrodden whenever you have the opportunity. And, if there is a spirit realm after this, remember the myth of Valhalla: the warriors will earn a seat at the table in the hall of heroes to feast with the kings of old and celebrate having lived life to its fullest. Fight not just for your own life, but for the lives of everyone; that is the mark of a true hero.</p>
<p>The length of your life will not be important when you are gone; it is the depth of it that will matter at all.</p></p>

        <p>Some of us see through this stuff but they have destroyed our lives. I have no one to see or talk to outside of my husband. I am talking about moving constantly but he doesn't want to. I know he's afraid since we have gone through too much, restarting everywhere is difficult, especially at this age. I wanted to live life the fullest but it seems like it's been destroyed on every level possible. This has felt like too much. I just want to have some friends, why is that so much to ask for? Real friends too, not people I have to pretend to be around. I only have online friends but I need to have a life. Husband is shut down, and okay with us living as hermits, but I can't take it, two years of this! I am sure the abusive family I went no contact with all lined up for the vaxx to the last cousin.</p>
<p>I am dealing with some major fear myself so yes have empathy. I am scared of the vaxxed giving off spike proteins, I've already had extreme medical trauma during this life. I have no unvaxxed to hang out with.</p>

        <p>Well said. Thank you for your post. I do wish to say though that many of them are brainwashed, and are psychologically damaged from the propaganda been fed to them for all these decades. These ignorant complacent fools will turn on us if the government tells them too, as the government perceives us hold-outs as a threat to their nefarious plans. I expect an onslaught of propaganda and fear-mongering tactics soon from various world governments, to try to get all of us vaxxed. Sad times ahead indeed.</p>

        <p>Or we could just ignore those losers and stop letting them control the national discourse on this stuff lol</p>
<p>We need to bring back shaming people who try to use their cowardice to control our lives</p>
