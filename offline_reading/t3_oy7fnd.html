    <strong>Thank you!</strong>
    <p><p>Just wanted to say thanks to everyone for the posts. it's good to know that there are others out there who share the same views. As a martial artist it's been difficult to train with others with all the mandates and last year set me back as the curriculum changed and everything became virtual. Then classes started back to normal this spring and everyone was able to come back together with masks on. It was difficult doing high intensity training with the masks. Then in June the mask mandate became optional as it should of been to begin with. Now there is talk of another lockdown and I am scheduled to test for my black belt at the end of September. It means everything to me as I haven't accomplished much in life and this is big for me. 4 years of training comes down to this moment and it's once again these lockdowns are on the horizon. Coming here and seeing similar circumstances makes me feel a little better so thank you guys. We can't let these evil people stop us from reaching out goals.</p></p>

        <p>Didn’t have a college graduation due to Covid. Was first in family to go to University, and it was a very esteemed one too. Very costly. I paid my way. I come from poor beginnings. So just know if it does sidetrack you, you aren’t alone. They’ve done it to a lot of us and you can vent whenever. I still haven’t let it go honestly.</p>

        <p>It's hard because every single generation before had a graduation ceremony until now. These moments are important as you are supposed to remember them the rest of your life. It's not fair to take that away. I never understood why people who are scared can't just stay home. Hell these days you can get just about anything delivers to your house. But no. They want those of us who just want to live our lives stay home. It's madness.</p>
