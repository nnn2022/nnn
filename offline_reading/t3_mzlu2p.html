    <strong>In light of a 13 year old girl who allegedly died of COVID-19 in Ontario can we start to have a real discussion about ALL aspects of WELLNESS? This is not political. Overweight, vitamin D deficient, and/or old people are more at risk to ALL sickness and death. OF COURSE NO KIDS SHOULD DIE HERE!</strong>
    <p><p>So, I will say it again - NO I do not wish any deaths on any kids - not even for an I TOLD YOU SO moment.</p>
<p>This said, I am fundamentally in disagreement with everything to do with any lockdown, any restrictions on business, schooling, religion, travel, and any other basic rights we all enjoyed before this all started. </p>
<p>If this really WAS about our health:
- our politicians would not have closed down gyms 
- our schools would be open and encouraging children’s physical health and well-being. There is no recess or playground in zoom school. 
- our media would be directly addressing the link between obesity and covid-19. Overweight people are at risk of a host of medical issues - not just covid-19 susceptibility 
- our media would be actively telling people of colour that THEY are biologically at risk for lower vitamin D levels - not to be racist, but because higher melanin levels in darker skin tones actively blocks UV and in turn the production of vitamin D. 
- old people uhhh - they die - at one point or another - they die. They shouldn’t have to live with the indignity of dying alone surrounded by nurses who care so much they are tiktokking about it all. This happens during every flu season - every year - look it up - it’s a thing!
- PCR test cycles run at 35+ count are COMPLETELY useless. Let me explain this the way it was explained to me. When hunting for a scrap of DNA in a large sample, like at a crime scene, it is useful forensically to discover the PRESENCE of DNA to confirm the whereabouts of a killer. Unfortunately, while the test DOES confirm the presence of this DNA - in the case of covid - PCR seeks to determine the mere presence of a strand of covid genetic material. What is the problem here? In the crime scene for example, the PCR test does not tell the test administrators whether the piece of genetic material is a killer or not, only that that person was there - with a hair or skin sample. In the case of covid, the test does not distinguish between active, or defeated covid cells. It does not distinguish between a sample that has been around for a day or for months - only that it is present! 
PCR methodology is designed to magnify (double) the amount of sample per cycle run. So 35 cycles run on a PCR test is 2^35 times more genetic material than was present in the sample to begin with. 36 cycles (2^36) and so on. If we continue to focus on the sheer presence of the killer’s hair, then we are, by rights, associating any location the killer sheds a hair as a murder scene. This is what is happening with covid. Whether you have fought the virus off successfully, or are dealing with it presently, the PCR test cannot and will not be able to tell you the difference between these two cases. Counting a “positive case” with no symptoms is essentially attempting to quantify every single non lethal case of the cold or the flu. People with high functioning immune systems are fine, and those with underlying health issues may not be. 
We need to stop looking for the hairs the murderer keeps dropping and actually dealing with the murderer where he may strike and protect those that are vulnerable. </p>
<p>Our politicians are too worried about the path the murderer takes to get to the crime scene. If the killer still wants to take someone down, closing down roads, air travel and such will only go so far. This killer is on a mission. No lockdown is going to stop it. We must instead focus our efforts on protecting the vulnerable and allowing everyone else to get back to where we were before the first mentions that COVID-19  was a “thing” at all.</p></p>

        <p>Here’s the problem I always have. Did she actually have the disease/illness, or did she test positive for PCR?</p>
<p>Here’s the thing, if you are young and actually do die from COVID-19 illnesss, something was wrong with you. There is no “normal, healthy” person who dies from it. Death from it is proof you were not healthy. This IS the science. This is HOW it works.</p>

        <p>Ah, it's not necessarily proof of unhealthy.  Potentially evidence of how much were they exposed to.  Drinking someone's backwash vs grabbing a handle.  Like any disease best not give it a significant head start, the immune system takes a while to ramp up.</p>

        <p>Viral load has been shown for adding extra symptoms for other diseases in healthy age adults, but true studies on children are not done as often.  Even currently most studies still use overall more men than women.  Easy to assume though if in one than the other as well.</p>

        <p>This is a huge stretch. And again, viral load has not been show to be a factor in a single youth fatality so far. It has only been shown to drive symptomatic vs asymptomatic infection. Symptomatic infection is not necessarily anywhere near death. We need to stick to the facts here.</p>

        <p>Eh don't see the stretch, pretty much common sense.  And just because their hasn't been a study does not mean common sense didn't determine the result earlier.  Such as dogs show compassion, determined thousands of years before a study said yes.  And for the initial conversation, if I inject you with a tiny bit influenza versus a cup full, one will by all probability kill you and the other you'll likely be fine.</p>

        <p>It’s not common sense. It’s the conclusion someone who is uniquely without common sense derives. If viral load was significant in the deaths of healthy children, we would all know about it because it would be international news, study or not. Most of what makes the news these days has no empirical evidence to support it anyway. There is no evidence in existence that even suggests viral load is significant in child mortality. It’s an illogical leap if you have an even passing apprehension of the relevant virology.</p>

        <p>Ay ay ay, can't even use common sense then the conversation is over.  If you need emperical evidence  to understand that anything absolutely anything in the universe can kill you in large quantities then your lost.  Sorry if the study on how many cats sitting on your chest to crush you is not done yet, but yes their is a number and you'd be stupid to believe otherwise solely for the reason a study for that particular action has not been done yet.</p>

        <p>This happened relatively near to me and I’ve read almost every source posted on the subject. This poor girl will be used solely for political purposes. </p>
<p>It is alleged that she displayed serious symptoms for a whole week before she passed so much so that she couldn’t get up by herself (later reported to have pneumonia). Her father refrained from taking her to the hospital in fear that she’d be transferred hours away (since you know hospitals are at capacity). </p>
<p>Since this has come to light the hospital in their area has publicly stated that they will have room for anyone seeking treatment but the sentiment for the past month has been “we’re running out of room”. This is a case of neglect fuelled by media/politician outrage. </p>

        <p>anything qualifies as covid in the media.</p>
<p>a 13yo probably has as much chance of getting hit by lightning 2x on their birthday as they do "dying of COVID" - if it even exists. , unless they have other issues of course just like the flu.</p>

        <p>Except that studies done on this subject over the past 40 years by places like Johns Hopkins University, JH Hospital, etc. have said "Actually no... the overweight and obese are actually NOT more likely to die from various diseases on the merits!"</p>
<p>Serious there: Overweight and obese people are actually equally or LESS likely to die from various health issues than right-weight/underweight people are.</p>
