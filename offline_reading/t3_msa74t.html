        <p>What's funny is that before the pandemic all the same people complained too about overpopulation. They had pro abortion (not pro choice) views and some even suggested to make it legal to kill babies under 1 year old because they hate children with passion,euthanize elderly and all sort of nihilistic,pro human extinction and misanthropic views but all of a sudden we all need to sacrifice everything to save a minority of vulnerable people.</p>
<p>That's why i don't believe in their so called empathy. They just hate society and humans so much that staying home and doing nothing is a dream that came true for them. The more honest one even admit it.</p>

<p>this must be the part i find both tragically ironic and completely unbelievable. people are told it's all to save grandma and somehow, <em>everyone just believed that shit</em>. Like... what?! It's not even remotely believable. Not to mention the fact that everything that was done accomplished nothing but <em>harm</em> the most vulnerable.</p>

        <p>What? Who suggesting killing one year old children?</p>
<p>Also this obsession with gates is so fucking dumb. He’s just a dude who bought a good idea at the right time, and hoarded all his money until his wife convinced him he was being a dick. He’s not a mastermind, he’s most likely only slightly above average intelligence. Is distributing anti malaria medication and mosquito nets also part of the grand scheme to kill everyone?</p>

        <p>You just claimed before that it was the people who are pushing vaccines who also hold this view. This article says two philosophers put this idea forward in a medical journal to generate discussion. It sounds like the Christian Right dug it out of a medical journal to piss people off. The authors explain the point of the assertion, to force those who are pro choice to differentiate between murder and medical procedure. As the article points out like it’s some kind of “gotcha” moment, this can also be used to justify pro-life stances. Teasing out nuance by taking a line of logic to a place that either doesn’t make sense or is morally unacceptable is a common tactic in philosophical discussion. The author of the article even acknowledges this than goes back into being outraged by the idea, than attempts to make her position unassailable by saying she is pro life and anyone who has a problem with her extremely poorly written article just doesn’t agree with her position. Idk if there is a word for this style of writing, but she goes back and fourth between reporting the facts and stoking outrage that the facts contradict. This article is basically designed to have quotes lifted for misleading Facebook post. Did you initially encounter this idea that “they” are suggesting killing infants from this article, or from a post making a claim based on the article?</p>

        <p>Вill and Mеlindа Gаtеs Foundation is a front. You clearly have not done your research so I won't hold it against you. People in India and Africa have a very negative view of Gates even though according to you he "helped them." What Gаtеs does is not philanthropy, it is investing coupled with a saviour complex while also harming others. </p>
<p>Furthermore you are likely a zoomer because you are too young to remember that Gаtеs is/was a villain. His "philanthropic" efforts coincided with the height of media scrutiny of him during the Microsoft monopoly trials.</p>
<p>&rt; Mr. Gаtеs contributed $20.3 billion, or 71 percent of his total contributions to the foundation . . . during the 18 months between the start of the trial and the verdict.” A wealth manager frankly states, “his philanthropy has helped ‘rebrand’ his name.”</p>
<p>&rt; <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2020/04/bill-gates-foundation-philanthropy-microsoft">source</a></p>
<p>Throwing big monetary amounts around like "50 billion dollars" like it means anything is just kind of cringe tbh.

        <p>Are any of your sources saying that he has a net negative impact on lives saved vs lost by his efforts? Because I responded to a person saying he would never want to save lives. It seems most of your arguments are saying that bill gates is just doing it for other reasons and not that what he is doing is killing people</p>

        <p>&rt; Are any of your sources saying that</p>
<p>You should read them to find out.</p>
<p>A lot of people do claim that his "philanthropy" is killing people. I have heard that the vассines he "tried out" in India and Africa left people sterilized and/or paralyzed. You should try to do your own research on this but if you don't know how to search, good luck, because you won't find anything. Gаtеs runs a PR campaign to make himself look like a saint. Try to google anything negative about him...all the results are positive. And all the semi-critical results are "debunked." Why? What is he hiding?</p>
<p>Think: if Gаtеs earned his fortune using evil methods, what makes you think he is doing "good" now? He got rich by being obsessed with power and obsessed with crushing his competition to the point of rocking back-and-forth mania (like shown <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgm455M-N3Y">here</a>), and grew Microsoft using "Embrace, Extend, and Extinguish" (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace%2C_extend%2C_and_extinguish">source</a>). If under his direction, Microsоft referred to its competitors with phrases like "take away their oxygen supply” and “crush them” (<a href="https://www.theringer.com/tech/2018/5/18/17362452/microsoft-antitrust-lawsuit-netscape-internet-explorer-20-years">source</a>) maybe it's not a sign of virtuosity.</p>
<p>Direct quote from Gates, "The world today has 6.8 billion people. That's headed up to about nine billion. Now, if we do a really great job on new vассines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent." enough said.</p>

        <p>Sorry you gave me a 50 page document to read through and I had one question to answer so I think me reading through that for the next hour or two is probably not the move when I can just ask you and assuming you read your sources then it could be answered in seconds.</p>
<p>Yes but the claim is that he is out to kill people and his organization has had a massive impact in saving a lot of lives through things like those vaccines. So if he is killing people as his goal then he should have a larger number of kills as a result than lives saved by his efforts. </p>
<p>Gates was talking about limiting population growth by tackling issues that cause people to over produce such as lack of contraception. Does it really seem reasonable to you that gates would hop up on stage for a Ted talk and reveal his evil master plan to kill 16% of the world? Seriously you guys are painting him like some cartoony James bond villain who has some devious plan to kill an absurd number of people for little reason at all other than evil.</p>

        <p>It strikes me as operating in bad faith when somebody drops a 50 page document that is somewhat related to what I said. If they are operating in good faith they read through that article and can say succinctly what the article says or where to find the relevant points. Seeing as he didnt do either of those things, he is either operating in bad faith by not really checking his sources, or he is operating in bad faith by making me waste an hour or two reading something he could say in a few lines. </p>
<p>Now that guy has responded to me now and didn't answer my question on the 50 page article so I think my accusation was correct.</p>

<p>Over-producing? That's absurd. What are you on about? Drop the malthusian nonsense.</p>
<p>&rt; his organization has had a massive impact in saving a lot of lives</p>
<p>According to who? you? BMGF official press releases? Saying blanket statements like this is juvenile and lacks all nuance. It's just personhood-worship. Your responses ignore the possibility that Gаtеs has done evil things. That in itself proves that you don't see the big picture. The fact that you think any criticism of him is "painting him as a james bond villain" is not correct. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle. Drop your rosy-colored glasses and stop putting Gаtеs on a pedestal. He doesn't care about you. </p>
<p>You are just a zoomer that lacks historical context because in your mind Gаtеs is the "Windows guy" and "ted talk guy." Whenever you research, it would behoove you to research both sides. Clearly you neglected that and now are on the Gаtеs train, full steam ahead. If you want to defend a control freak posing as a philanthropist, it is your decision and your mistake.</p>

        <p>Whether or not you acknowledge it there are constraints on the population of the world. Sorry it isn't nonsense it is real.</p>
<p>If you want a source then you can just ask. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundation</p>
<p>If you look there under global health division you can see his donations have gone to organizations which saved lives, funded disease testing and research, and provided vaccines for diseases like polio. </p>
<p>I am not saying he is a good guy I am just saying he isn't some massive evil guy who wishes to kill us with a vaccine. There is a big gap in between what we are saying and just because I don't think he has been killing children on the regular doesn't mean I think he is great. I don't ignore the possibility he has done such things, I just want proof of the mass murders if it is out there.</p>

        <p>You should have just said from the start that you got your research from wikipedia. It's like reading the sparknotes for a book and thinking you know what it's about.</p>
<p>&rt; I am just saying he isn't some massive evil guy</p>
<p>The problem is evil has evolved quite a bit. Satan is a conniving, cowardly little pest. Evil has no originality and thus tries to masquerade as "good." If you are looking for explicit video footage of Gаtеs gunning down Africans with a vассine machine gun then you won't find it. The ultimate effect of his policies is evil, but you won't understand this if you are divorced from context. You have to really look into the heart of the matter, which is why I linked you to a dedicated journalist's take on it. Wikipedia simply won't cut it.</p>
<p>I have went back to the PDF and found key quotes. You've shown disinterest so mainly these are for any other people reading this tread. But once again read the whole publication to get the whole picture and the overall vibe.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Big business cannot be the solution to poverty and inequality because the relentless pursuit of profit is incompatible with securing social and economic justice for all. (page 5)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore the foundation is also using its funds to promote the increasing privatization of health services in developing countries. (page 7)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it seems as if the BMGF is applying the same logic to global health policy as it did to building a computer empire. (page 13)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BMGF has a narrowly conceived understanding of health as the product of technical interventions divorced from economic social and political contexts (page 14)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>everyone is scared of challenging Gаtеs and the foundation's role because they don't want to lose their funding (page 15)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the BMGF...is reshaping aid policy further away from prioritising rights and justice towards a technocratic 'authoritarian development'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The preference for technological solutions over those that address systemic social, economic or political issues favours corporations (since they tend to deliver the technology) and can let governments and donors off the hook, by allowing them to downplay corruption, human rights abuses and social inequality as causes of human suffering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The BMGF has influence without accountability (page 16)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The BMGF is not required to be subjected to independent evaluations of its work (page 19)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Gаtеs Foundation works closely with many corporations whose role and policies contribute to ongoing poverty. The BMGF does not see these corporations as a problem, but as partners in development (page 20).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moreover, BMGF often invests in the same companies as it is funding, meaning the foundation has an interest in the ongoing profitability of these corporations. This is a corporate merry-go-round where the BMGF consistently acts in the interests of 
corporations. (page 20)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Much of the BMGF’s money for its charitable activities derives from investments by the BMFG Trust in companies which are contributing to the problems of poverty, inequality and injustice in the first place. The investees include many of the most criticised companies in the world for involvement in human rights, labour and environmental abuses, and tax avoidance. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Andy Beckett: 'a suspicion lingers, slowly fading but still there, that the foundation’s activities are some sort of penance for Gates’ world-dominating behaviour at Microsoft – or a continuation of that world domination by other means'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The BMGF is promoting a number of specific priorities through its agriculture grants, several of which are undermining the interests of small farmers while claiming to support them. These include promoting a model of industrial agriculture, the increasing use of chemical fertilisers and expensive, patented seeds, the privatisation of extension services and a very large focus on genetically modified seeds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the greatest controversies of the BMGF’s funding is its support for research into genetic modification (GM)...these crops often push farmers into debt, cause irreversible environmental damage and encourage land concentration, among other problems (page 30)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Much of the BMGF’s work appears to bypass local knowledge (page 33)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rather, the foundation is “orientated towards bringing foreign technology into Africa and opening up markets to foreign corporations, rather than building on the possibilities, capacities and knowledge the farmers already have”. (page 33)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation needs to end its support for corporate controlled agricultural systems which promote reforms such as privatised seeds and encourages the widespread use of synthetic inputs that lead famers to become dependent on purchasing expensive products every season.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>To summarize, evil often masquerades as an angel of light. By promoting policies that are on the outside "good-looking" and "philanthropic" but are actuality are quite destructive and neglect the root cause which is injustice, Gаtеs is doing more harm than good. Gаtеs is a wolf in sheep's clothing. Few see him for who he really is because of self-censorship. Just like lust for power lead Gаtеs to monopolize the PC industry with Microsоft and the BMGF, so too does this mania drive him to want to have control over his public image. What started as a PR campaign during the Microsоft trials has grown into the abomination you see today. It is quite effective: people like you are unwilling to see the truth and instead resort to defending a strange old man whom they've never met.</p>

        <p>Right? The US alone is about 2 billion acres. 1 billion people could live in America, each with 2 acres of private property. I obviously know that not every acre is habitable/tenable etc but my point is only that there is a vast amount of unused land worldwide.  I bet the "elites" are planning to cram everyone into dense metropolitan centers to make people forget about how vast the world really is. I mean bill gates is buying millions of acres of farmland, likely to exclude people from ever having their own little parcel. I doubt he wants to be running farms.</p>

        <p>They don't. That said, overpopulation is not a boolean, it's relative to time, quality of life, and resources.</p>
<p>For 8 billion people to live like an average American for more than a few years is probably unsustainable given the current resources and technologies. 8 billion people is probably long-term sustainable if we all live in trash heaps.</p>

        <p>The reason overpopulation is a problem and why they for instance push it in Africa so hard is because not all people are equally capable of meeting the challenges. Without transfer payments and food aid there would’ve been many more African famines. The goal of the elites is to stop the Africans and latins particularly from having babies to reduce their obligation to save them.</p>

        <p>Yup, that's definitely a factor. Mencius Moldbug calls it the Dire Problem.</p>
<p>&rt; Stated most boldly, the Dire Problem is that there is a line of productive competence beneath which a human being is a liability, not an asset, to the society including him. This calculation is made in terms of the marginal human—does California gain or lose by adding one person just like this person? For millions, the answer is surely the latter.</p>
<p>&rt; Worse, with the steady advance of technology, this line rises. That is: the demand for low-skilled human labor shrinks. Abstract economics provides no guarantee whatsoever that the marginal able-bodied man with an IQ of 80 can feed himself by his own labors. If you doubt this line, simply lower it until you doubt it no more. At least logically, there is a biological continuum between humans and chimpanzees, and the latter are surely liabilities.</p>
<p>&rt; Why does this matter? It matters because either (a) a man can feed himself, or (b) he dies horribly of starvation, or (c) someone else feeds him. If (a), he is an asset. If (c), he is a liability—to someone. If (b), he makes a horrible mess and fuss while dying, and is thus in that sense a liability. Moreover, the presence of the poor becomes extremely unpleasant well before the starvation point.</p>

        <p>In what way? Is there a measurable proof of this or are you just using random theory created by Doomers to push mass genocide or sterilization?</p>
<p>It blows my mind that people believe in evolution and biology and then in the same breath also believe that going against one of the most fundamental aspects of life (propagation of the species) is some how not only not normal but destructive to the environment or the Earth. I’m a Christian and even I can see the massive flaw in that ideology. If we become to much on the Earth then the Earth and natural selection will eradicate numerous people to thin the herd. Be it starvation or otherwise. Thinking that we are oh so advanced that we can control the planet in any meaningful sense just further proves my opinion that humans are by in large complete egomaniacs who think we are bigger than we are. We have no inherent control over our small human lives let alone the planet and we shouldn’t have such authority. It belongs to God alone.</p>

        <p>On the same coin, wouldn't appearances also be deceiving if you lived in a rural area with few people? Overpopulation is hardly related to density.</p>
<p>I don't think people are saying those resources you mentioned are going to "run out", they are saying that the more people live on our planet, the more resources we need. There certainly is a limit for humans that can live on this planet at once. Whether it is 10B, 20B or way more, there eventually will be a line where we are unable to replenish as quickly as we consume. In which case, the population would stabilize naturally. The fact that we can be gluttonous right now is a huge privilege</p>

        <p>If the population would stabilize naturally it refuted the concept of overpopulation being a thing. The only group on the planet who adheres to the concept of overpopulation and it shows in the data are white people. Who are below replacement rate in the US due to birth rates. Everyone else on the planet is shitting out kids.</p>
<p>I’ll worry about over population when advocates go to 3rd world countries and start telling them to stop having kids first. Yet again everyone expects one section of people to solve a problem that is supposedly global problem. It’s stupid on its face and to any onlooker would appear malicious in intent.</p>

        <p>I'm just talking shit about Bill Gates. Could very well be wrong about this one. In which case, I withdraw my statement. Although, I followed my statement by saying I was just speculating. It seems like something he would do. Doesn't change the fact Gates is a shady individual who built a dogshit operating system. I believe wild speculation is well within our first amendment rights to free speech. Not even calling for insurrection here. </p>
<p>I believe Hillary Clinton is a Reptilian alien who eats babies. Not even joking. Can't prove it though. But will still say it, because... well, we need to have the right to entertain false scenarios and bad ideas. It's crucial to the evolution of critical thinking. I throw out something absurd, you counter it with facts and logic. It's a fun game, and good for our brains. Take this as a lesson to not believe everything a random asshole like myself posts on the Internet.</p>

        <p>I never liked that argument because it ignores how much "land" humans really use. Could people live well in Texas in an "under the dome" situation where nothing other than sunlight is allowed to enter the area from outside? Where do you get the wood to build the houses, and the metal for the nails?</p>

        <p>We are absolutely abusing our natural resources and any who disagrees doesn’t know what they’re talking about. Sure we’ll be okay for next next 50-100 years but our future generations will suffer if we keep going the way we are currently. The right wing mindset is so hyper focused on the right now that it neglects the lives of our children and great grandchildren and seeing everyone on this sub downplay what’s happening is sad. Fuck COVID if we keep up this way y’all are gonna want to wear a mask due to pollution in the air just look at major cities in China( I’ve been there I know first hand how bad the air quality is). No one is coming for the tax dollars on the 15 an hour you guys make some of us just want to protect our planet.</p>

        <p>Wooooorld is ovvvverpoooopulattteeeeed. Can you have 7 billion even 12 billion people on this earth without drastically altering the quality of life supporting functions that the water cycle provides? EASILY with our technology and know how. BUT IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN because frugality is something that throughout human history has always been cast aside in times of plenty, especially at the peaks of empires. To provide the sheer amount of unsustainable consumption wealthy industrialized nations eat nowadays requires tons of energy/pollution/waste. </p>
<p>World governments and the Bill Gates-esque fucks are touting green energy like that's going to change anything: obviously its bullshit. The solution to accelerating climate change is reduction in consumption, easiest way to do that is depopulation. But Bill Gates ran a company. Companies make money from selling stuff to people. More people = more sales, they are global afterall. They have every interest in a ballooning population, really helps out with those taxes + unfunded liabilities (cough social security). That's why they sell green energy as a solution. So what's the issue with voluntarily not reproducing and abortions, especially in a world run by these assholes? Not like anyone ever complained about not existing. Abortions = 100% baby murder but the only alternative is access to contraceptives and once you start limiting abortion access its not a far step politicaly. Exponential population growth in every species that has ever existed on this earth has always reversed, why not front run it. TL;DR got mad my viewpoint was downvoted</p>

        <p>Interesting... My wife (who is way more researched than I am) was talking today about how on of the main health treatments for covid prevention is vitamin D... And people with higher melanin level naturally produce less vitamin D with sun exposure... Therefore they're more sustainable to covid19. Ergo Covid19 is racist. I have to do more digging into the facts before I can verify.</p>

        <p>More accurately, restricting outdoor exercise time to 1 hour or whatever is racist, as has occurred in places like Australia and the UK. Vitamin D is an essential component of our general immune response and is not specific to any particular virus. Even some anti-cancer processes are mediated via vitamin D or in some cases more specifically via UV exposure.</p>
