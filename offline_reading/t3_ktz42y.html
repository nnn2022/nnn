    <strong>I feel so pathetic that I feel proud for taking a damn walk</strong>
    <p><p>I know New Zealand is the country known for sheep but let it be known, don't buy the bullshit that Australia is great, or that we've accomplished crap. If you hear that we're "conquering covid", please remember that this is just code for acknowledging just how mindless the general population is here.</p>
<p>Not helped by the ptsd, I have now had to legitimately psych myself up to take a damn walk.</p>
<p>Thank God I'm halfway to blind when I'm not wearing my glasses because I've ditched them just so I can not see it physically. This is day two of this garbage (out of a 3 day lockdown hahahahahahaha. They must have forgotten to add a couple of zeroes to that lie)</p>
<p>I could tell I had judgement from the faceless faces, but I just cranked up the David Goggins through my headphones and kept going.</p>
<p>But jesus christ I feel pathetic for feeling relieved for getting back home. Really really wish I wasn't so affected by these mindless drones.</p>
<p>I may have used to be naive and ignorant but I can't be anymore, that was ripped from me awhile ago. But I'll continue hoping that just one person saw me and at least remotely second guessed what the fuck they were doing and why they are doing it. That's all</p></p>

        <p>You shouldn’t feel pathetic, you’re only human.  Propaganda and massive peer pressure are a bitch.  Keep doing what you’re doing, and eventually the part of your brain that gives a shit about being judged by these lunatics will turn off.</p>

        <p>Don’t feel pathetic! Feel proud. Your making a stand for yourself and others. You’re inspiring others to take a stand too. It’s wonderful</p>

        <p>I had a similar experience during the SA lockdown. It's really, really tough to be anti-lockdown in Australia, sometimes I wish I could take the kool-aid that's everyone else seems to have drunk just so I can have a break from feeling like an alien in my own country.</p>

        <p>Be proud!! A lot of people would be looking at you wishing they had your courage. Ive gone through life generally complying with rules etc but the covid charade has made me question everything. I refuse to wear a mask in the car and I will not wear one while I'm out walking in nature. Hopefully it catches on and people stop being sheep.</p>
