    <p><p>If you believe in the title, then you are extremely naive.</p>
<p>In a society where virtually everything is a private corporation, the government doesn't need to directly infringe on its citizens' rights.</p>
<p>Allow me to elaborate. Let's say the government wants to limit your right to self expression by requiring everyone to wear a certain item of clothing. You would be outraged, wouldn't you?</p>
<p>But what if your government is smarter than that, and pays these mega corporations to achieve the same? "Bail outs?"</p>
<p>Do you really think when the government paid hundreds of BILLIONS to the airlines under the guise of bailouts they didn't demand anything in return?</p>
<p>Do you really think when government shut every business down, but let Walmart Costco remain open they didn't demand anything in return?</p>
<p>Do you think when government gave immunity to Facebook, Twitter and Google, they didn't demand anything in return?</p>
<p>Some of you people are cheering because some governor signed a bill into law that prohibits "the state" from requiring citizens to be vaccinated. How naive of you...</p>
<p>In a country where almost everything is a private corporation and the government helps creation of giants monopolies, you have to be really naive to truly believe that an airline should be able to put you on a no-fly list for life or Twitter should be able to silence you for expressing your opinion.</p></p>
