    <strong>I wish there was more I could do</strong>
    <p><p>Where I live, the urge to virtue signal is super high. So mask compliance is super high (near 100%) and a number of larger municipalities have mandated masks in all shops. Nothing statewide yet, and nothing outdoors, but with the goobers in charge here, it's only a matter of time.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I can (and do) just avoid those municipalities and shops to the extent that I can. Wanna be a security theatre asshole? Fine, you get none of my money. But obviously, some things, like groceries, I still have to buy (begrudgingly). </p>
<p>There seems to be a narrative forming that anti-mask people are Trump supporters, and therefore are bad. Look at these assholes complaining about "muh rights" and masks, aren't they stupid? And to be sure, I agree that a private business can declare whatever conditions for entry they want. No issues there. However, in the US, that hasn't been the case in decades. Private businesses <em>cannot</em> declare any denial of service conditions they want. See all the court cases about gay wedding cakes, racist exclusions, and the entire fucking ADA. I <em>loathe</em> the hypocrisy of it. Suddenly all these assholes are just now caring about private business rights? Get fucked.</p>
<p>But what can I, just one person, do? I feel like the putting up a stink at the shop entrance is the reaction they <em>want</em> me to have. And since compliance is so high, I'm just one lone person, and would be labeled a nut anyway.</p>
<p>I'm tired. I'm so tired of everything. I feel like I don't care about anyone else anymore. I don't care about following social norms or "normal" behavior anymore. I used to work so hard at that. Now I'm just like, fuck it. I don't need to make eye contact anymore. I can ignore everyone else like they don't even exist. I never wear a mask properly. Usually below my nose.</p>
<p>I've been curious about entering with one, and then taking it off later, and if confronted, "oh, sorry, I was getting lightheaded, give me a minute. I'll put it back on." You know? Be a real sad, morose case. Make them feel bad for you, instead of being confrontational. Would that work?</p></p>

        <p>The hypocrisy is what kills me. People I know who have claimed for years that bodily autonomy is so important, but not in this situation. We're pro choice. We don't have to care about a fetus because our bodily autonomy is more important than anybody else's life but it doesn't apply here? Why the fuck not? I'm being consistent with my beliefs. Every liberal I know is being an enormous hypocrite.</p>
<p>Oh, and businesses can refuse service for ANY reason? That's what I'm hearing, ANY REASON! ANY REASON! Oh, so being black or gay? NO WTF, NOT THAT REASON, JUST ANY REASON! ANY REASON AT ALL! Ok, so not any reason, let's be honest and actually address reality. Just any reason you support. And the business doesn't even get to make this decision. The government can force them to deny service even if they'd rather keep the customer. </p>
<p>Oh, and the disability issue. The same exact people who have said a business cannot refuse to serve a customer based on disability are now saying, "They have to accommodate those with disabilities, they do not have to serve them!" What the fuck does that even mean to them? Oh, it means like a restaurant has to have ramps so a disabled person can get in but they DO NOT have to serve them food! Of course not! They have to accommodate the disabled, they do not need to serve them! This is a totally new, totally fucking ridiculous angle I've been hearing repeatedly lately. </p>
<p>The hypocrisy is absolutely mind blowing. People are rioting and screaming about demolishing the police one day and the very next day they're on facebook posting about how they just called the cops to tattle on their neighbors having a birthday party for their 3 year old. It's un-fucking-real.</p>

        <p>Fetus-killers are selfish by nature, it should come as no surprise that 'pro-choicers' don't <em>actually</em> give a shit about the freedom and livelihood of others and that 'bodily autonomy' and 'keep your laws off my body' only enter the discussion when it pertains to absolving themselves of responsibility.

<p>It's kind of sad, I used to be such a caring, thoughtful, empathetic person (still am in some ways) now I'm like, fuck it. Don't care. Oh, I'm being "rude"? Don't care.</p>
<p>What people in power don't understand is that even the lemmings are getting worn thin. I read some local story about some guy going off on a "racist" rant to some woman and her kid in the local post office. Assuming the report is accurate, I'm like, yeah, this is what happens. Nothing like that has ever happened here before. So why now? Because people are tired, they're fed up, and they don't care anymore. I don't condone going off on other people like that at all, but it's hard to argue that the mindset isn't entirely irrational.</p>

        <p>I’m very fortunate that I live in an area that is still mostly non masked (rural Wisconsin). But my “plan” if confronted with having to wear a mask to enter, is to make the biggest mockery of the rules as possible. Using the most flimsiest and ridiculous excuse for a “facial covering” that I can. I agree arguing and making a scene doesn’t accomplish much except risking you trouble. One idea I had was to take a piece of Kleenex, and use masking tape to wrap it around my head so the Kleenex is over my nose and mouth. Technically I’m covering my face, but also showing how stupid and non scientific the rules are.</p>

<p>Apparently took it off with no resistance whatsoever and proceeded to ring up his groceries as normal.</p>
<p>I was 99% sure when I read it that the guy was trolling them/masking regulations but the tone of the article was like, "White supremacists in grocery stores!" Maybe I am wrong and he was an actual KKK member.</p>

        <p>I know what you mean. I normally consider myself a reasonably engaged and empathetic person, but on some days I just don’t care anymore. I look at the Worldometer stats and think “good, maybe this will wipe us all out and we can shut down the planet for good.” Not a healthy attitude, but a logical consequence of having our rights stripped away IMO. Still, the better part of me thinks we cannot and should not give up. This is the fight of our lives.</p>

        <p>No, I don’t think wearing a mask in a store is having my rights stripped away. I think that being unable to hug and kiss loved ones, to form new intimate relationships, to perform or watch live music or theatre, to sing in chorus, to worship in groups, to engage in unfettered play, to bond through playing or watching sports, to have formative experiences such as graduations and weddings, to dance with other people, to attend festivals, to interact with whom you want and how you want, to travel freely, to have a reasonable shot at keeping your job or finding a new one, to open a small business without fear it will be shut down, and to have hope for the future—yes, I consider this having our rights stripped away.</p>

        <p>Like half of what you mentioned isnt banned. Literally the only thing banned is large gatherings. Even Fauci encourages people to see their close family and friends, assuming they aren’t going out to bars and parties and then hanging out with their 80-year-old grandparents. My son and I see my immediate family which includes his grandparents, aunt/uncle, and three cousins on a regular basis. My parents are planning a road trip with my grandparents. All of us take the virus seriously but we have established risk level by being honest about who we have contact with. If anyone sees other people who aren’t a distancing then we wait a bit to ensure they aren’t sick. </p>
<p>There’s no law against going on a date or forming new relationships. Again, this isn’t your right being stripped away because you still have the right. But good luck finding someone who is willing to casually date right now. The options are limited. I’m single too and I know it sucks. </p>
<p>It does suck not being able to go to concerts and large gatherings. This is literally the only thing banned in my state (California) but there are alternatives popping up and new safe options. </p>
<p>I just saw a small outdoor wedding take place at a big park down my street yesterday. It’s risky but this would be a terrible time to have a big indoor wedding. Otherwise, do it outdoors and space the seats out. Way better than someone dying because they went to your wedding, don’t you think?</p>
<p>You can still interact with whoever you want as long as it’s not against their will. Lol. What law says you can’t?! </p>
<p>I swear it’s like people are inventing things to be mad about. </p>
<p>No one is stopping you from opening up a business.</p>
<p>My company has hired 5 people since the pandemic happened out of a company of 80 employees. Not exaggerating. Everything is remote but they got situated fine and we all bond through video and daily calls. Our offices are opening in a few weeks but most people will keep working remotely because cases are skyrocketing and our local hospitals are planning crisis expansions due to being overrun possibly in the next month. </p>
<p>So for the most part, you still have the right to do all of that. Hell, you can go to Disneyworld if you’re so determined to expose yourself. </p>
<p>It sounds like you are just really frustrated at the pandemic itself, rather than our government. </p>
<p>You DO realize that the “lockdown” laws in the US are far more lax than countries with a similar case rate? And that we are actually worse off than most countries in the world?</p>

        <p>Thanks for responding. I just wanted to clarify that many of the losses I mentioned don’t apply to me personally. I’m Canadian, married, not religious, have worked from home for 26 years, and the pandemic has not affected my income. It just tears me apart that so many people I care about ARE suffering these losses. Some are depressed and losing hope. To be brutally honest, I find the burden on the young and the poor created by our pandemic strategy more tragic than the extra loss of life in nursing homes.</p>
<p>So no, it’s not the pandemic that’s frustrating me. It’s how we’ve chosen to deal with it.</p>

        <p>It’s funny how you mention the burden on the young but not the nurses, factory workers, retail workers, and many others who are dying. Not just old people!!! </p>
<p>If you’re in Canada, you don’t get it... I’m in SoCal where the lockdown lifted early and people ignored it. I know of three people in their 20s with mutual friends as me that all died in the PAST WEEK in my area (SoCal). Think about that for a second, please. One was a nurse. And the wave is only just beginning around here. You should be glad people in your country take it seriously or you would regret your words....</p>

        <p>It protects others by reducing how much of the virus is spread. Not only is this scientifically proven, but doctors have already been wearing masks for this purpose for many decades. I don’t understand why y’all deny it. Is it because it’s uncomfortable or looks weird? Genuinely curious. We know it’s not “health reasons” 🙄</p>
