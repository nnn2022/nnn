<p>Sure, let's forget about <em>unforseen long-term side effects</em> because of <strong>feelings</strong>.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry I was <em>being pedantic online</em>, as I would not detestify to such a statement in a common conversation.</p>
<p>The meaning of "<strong>good</strong>" is irrelevant between us people. It is as though us using "<em>good</em>", in personal lectures, is as akin to the "curse" of using a <em>curse word</em>. Although not a defilement on language, any and all of our minds can be defiled, OR FULFILLED by the words which we do and do not speak!</p>
<p>But Jesus tells us to remember just this: Answer to God <a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/matthew/5/33-37">not with your lips, not with your head, but with your Heart.</a></p>

        <p>Thats reasonable. Honestly i dont think im going to get the shot just because i havent yet and i figure the covid nonsense will blow over by the time id get the shot anyway. Ive never been afraid of getting sick so i planned to wait a year or two after the vaccine was given to people just to see any delayed effects especially since this is a new technology which has not previously been used in any other vaccine ive been given and since im not afraid of getting sick anyway im actually a bit more concerned about humans wielding genetic programs they might not fully understand yet than i am about catching the flu</p>
<p>Ive never taken a flu shot and ive never seen any reason to. This disease does not appear to be any worse than the flu but for some reason this issue was politicized to the point where being terrified of this deadly plague means your one of the good guys and trying to stay calm and take reasonable precautions means your a crazy conspiracy nut. And from there it just got more and more extreme with each side having their own pissing contest. I simply did the same thing i always do and kept working because literally nothing changed except the way people behaved my life wasnt even impacted since all i do is work and sleep. </p>
<p>The virus may as well have been a big make believe game as far as it affected me as i never saw anything to warrant the reaction i saw all around me and the absolute worst that could have happened was that more people got pneumonia than the hospitals could treat in which case the death toll would climb. Which is why we were supposed to stay inside for two weeks to allow the hospitals to contain the outbreak and not be overwhelmed. </p>
<p>It felt like i was in a zombie movie where everyone is talking about zombies in some far away place and im just waiting to see the zombies running down the street at me but all i see is normal people doing normal things. It seems to me like people wanted a distraction from politics so they grabbed onto the virus and wouldnt let go and in doing so they made the virus entirely political which brought a renewed life and death seriousness to the politics which made everyone even more extreme and even more polarized and hateful and it seems like things will only get worse from here especially since people no longer have any sense of a shared reality, your reality that you experience now depends entirely on which echo chamber you personally subscribe to. </p>
<p>Its literally the matrix with a red pill and a blue pill except neither pill is reality, we are already in reality but the two pills are propagandized realities meant to set these two ways of looking at the world against each other. Imagine you give one person a blue pill and one person a red pill and then you show them any image and they will immediately start talking shit and physically attacking each other while arguing about whats in the image. That is literally the system we have created for ourselves, a perfect hell for everyone involved.</p>
<p>The biggest threat to my life in the last year was caused not by the new flu going around but from the fear and panic that caused people to go out and strip the shelves bare because the media hyped them up and scared the shit out of them in order to gain more power, its exactly like 9/11 and the patriot act and your all going to feel silly in 5 years when they are still abusing powers grabbed in this mass hysteria but just like 9/11 we will have a bunch of people refusing to see the truth who are adamant that we narrowly escaped the apocalypse which was only such a close call because we had a small portion of the population who did not get terrified of the virus, aka "the world almost ended, and its all the republicans fault." </p>
<p>I dont see how we can undo the psychological programming. People wont even admit they are being programmed so how do you treat them for it? If your a democrat then go look at how the world looks to a republican its like some crazy conspiracy where they are being programmed to be afraid and hateful of democrats and their goals/ideals. And if your a republican then you have probably already seen how the democrats are being programmed to live in constant fear while also placing the blame for anything and everything on the republicans to breed that hate and resentment.</p>
<p>Im not a republican or democrat so i just end up hating everyone and being hated by everyone. I dont know where to go from here or how to try to start fixing things... I feel like i just have to step back and let the stupid masses kill each other off in our next civil war and then maybe we can find some way to get the people left over to actually look at the real world and then talk and actually listen to each other.</p>

        <p>I got the shot waiting for the second. But I'm only doing this to fit into the society of the sheeps. I want to be able to travel, do my job if called back to office, be able to visit public establishments etc. </p>
<p>I made that choice &amp; yes, 0 side effects. I do support the right to choose though. People can choose to not get vaccinated. It's their right to do so.</p>

<p>This is great. I mean -- it's awful, but it makes a solid point.</p>
<p>We are right about this. You can already see it happening. And once someone accepts the point you are making with this image --- suddenly all their lies, censorship, backtracking, altered numbers --- makes sense.</p>

        <p>This has been the most disturbing part of all of this for me. Like, if you REALLY care, you would show compassion to someone who is hesitant to get the vaccine. If you CARE, you CARE. There isn't really any way around that. I have quite a few friends who HAVE gotten the vaccine, who hear me talk about how I've got to wait due to a family history of adverse reactions to penicillin, and they genuinely care about my situation. They show me respect when I tell them that I feel like it's only natural to be cautious with such new medicine, no matter what has lead up to this moment. THIS is the proper way to act in response to someone not getting the vaccine. But more and more, we are seeing a very different approach by a lot of people.</p>
<p>If someone isn't showing you compassion in regards to YOUR own health, just as you are respecting and showing compassion in regards to theirs, then that is a new, much worse issue, in my opinion. We need to be more considerate of one-another, regardless of ANY disease/virus/issue of any kind... EVER. It's basic be a good human 101. </p>
<p>If someone is taking their life in their own hands and that *upsets* you, and you feel the need to call them STUPID or SELFISH, well... did you ever really actually CARE about them in the first place. The lack of reason and logic going on right now is mind-boggling. (Hey at least I'm not wasting too much time on the internet anymore like I used to, eh? BONUS) The behavior of many people who have been vaccinated has proved to me to be the biggest tell in all of this. It shine's a spotlight on the subconscious and extremely biased virtue-signaling that is running rampant everywhere right now.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Very tired of watching all of these people think they are fighting for some "greater good" when all they are really doing is pushing away their community, dividing it under the guise that their view is *right* and anyone who disagrees is *wrong.* It's sad. I literally feel a deep sense of sadness for these people who believe they are doing *good* They just can't see from outside of their perspective, it's that simple. No one wants to hear that though- that would mean they were *wrong.</p>
<p>WHAT IF WE ARE ALL WRONG? WHAT IF WE ARE ALL RIGHT? It doesn't matter. Listen to each other with an open heart... that's all there is to it, and yet it's what we, as a people, are struggling with the most right now.</p>
<p>It's almost like everyone forgot to really listen to one-another. Ironically, that's going to be the only thing that saves us in the end.</p>
<p>We would be wise to *lead by example* in this arena. Stop calling people names because they believe something different than you. It's a cop-out and it's literally making everything worse, while you grin, the world burns a little hotter, and you still think you're making it better, repeating the same mistake again, and again and again and... Something's got to give, y'all. </p>
<p>Start with yourself...</p>

        <p>Thanks for comming to a subreddit that you hate, sorting it by New, seeing this post, clicking on it, and commenting on it.</p>
<p>The meme is btw. based on Dan Kaminsky, a 40yo cyberecurity expert who spent months shilling for the vaccine and who said that he will share all his health data after getting vaxxed, and then died a few days after getting the vaccine without making his health data public. His family then printed a fake statement that he apparently made before his death where he told people to get vaxxed - they then retracted it and admitted that its not real. They also said that he died from diabetes... with 40.</p>

        <p>It does not.</p>
<p>25% of diabetes cases  aren't yet diagnosed. 88 million people have prediabetes. Just because somebody gets diagnosed while you getting treated for CoViD, doesn't mean that CoViD caused it. That would be a ridiculous assumption that just a CNN watching doomer would believe.</p>
<p>There is no data anywhere that even suggests that CoViD causes diabetes.</p>
