    <strong>I come from a long line of MISINFORMATION peddlers!! Misinformation is in my DNA!! My Republican great-grandpappy was the original ANTI-VAXXER!!</strong>
    <p><p>The Biscuits are a proud yet humble family stretching back eons. I have traced my lineage back to Roman times!! My ancestor, Emperor Nero, is heralded to have played the fiddle whilst Rome burned, willfully oblivious to the suffering of those around him! Now, as the World descends into chaos as a result of the vile pestilence that has been thrust upon us due to the consumption of contaminated bat-soup, I too will engage in decadence and hedonism (not wearing a mask, refusing an experimental clot-shot, thinking logically) at the expense of the 0.001% of people who are at risk!</p>
<p>During the Great Plague it is said that SoggyBiscuit (an absolute LEGEND in Biscuit family lore) played pied piper and led rats through the streets of London in an effort to spread the plague amongst others. Indeed, the plague-rat is on our family crest, resplendent in all its vile glory. Furthermore, my great-grandpappy CrustyBiscuit was part of the original Anti-Mask League of San Francisco during the Spanish flu of 1918, and before that he was on the Titanic's maiden voyage, where he reassured everyone that they had <em>not</em> hit an iceberg and that there was no need to panic, all whilst securing a life jacket and place in the lifeboat for himself.</p>
<p>My grandfather followed in his footsteps and went on to refuse every vaccine ever offered to him, as did my father. We have all been staunch Republicans since the inception of the Republican party in 1854. We're all conspiracy theorists too and wear tinfoil hats when we sit down to dinner so the 5G microwaves can't penetrate our brains and listen to our thoughts!! You see, I can't be blamed for being the way I am because it's just ingrained in me. Misinformation and wrong-think is our bread and butter. We live and breath it. I am just as much a victim as anyone else!!</p></p>
