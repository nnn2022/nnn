    <strong>At the hospital for some blood work</strong>
    <p><p>Strict security at the doors so I had to mask up but as soon as I pass security i put my mask under my nose and have sat for almost an hour now and no one has said anything...then some fat chick who works for the hospital and not even the actual security tells me I need to put my mask over my nose. So I slide it up and she turned the corner and walked away and right back down it went.  Fuck these people. I have a right to breathe free oxygen unrestricted . I'm not sick I already had covid a few months ago and I'm not going to make other people's health my responsibility.</p></p>

        <p>The last time I went to my doctor it was like that. His office is in a big urgent care center so not quite a hospital but not a small office. The place was dead empty. People are afraid to get medical treatment and the nurses are dancing on Tik Tok.</p>

        <p>I mean right now I'm in the main lobby because allegedly the lab is so packed right now and there was no seats when I got here.. now it's pretty devoid.. haven't seen the wards and won't be in that area. But from what I can see this hospital is the same as it's always been traffic wise.</p>

        <p>In law fell off motorcycle and had to go to hospital. He said it was empty when he was there. Another in law is a physician in a diff state, he seems miserable from what i gathered and has to do what he is told else he may not have a job anymore. He was also told to take the vaccine which left him bed ridden for a few days. Fun stuff man. Luckily i never go there. H8 the hospitals.</p>

        <p>I try to avoid healthcare facilities for these exact reasons. My fiance has alluded that if clients for the it company I work for mandate that we can't be on-site without the vaccine then I should get it but I refuse . I will not put experimental gene therapy in my body. My boss was first in line to get the shot since his wife is a doctor but I highly doubt he would make me get it.</p>

        <p>I'm trying to understand your thought process  here, so help me out.
You go to hospital which is surely the one place we would do everything we can to not spread any nasties and seem quite pleased with yourself that you made a point of not doing everything you can.</p>
<p>While I agree that masks are a bit inconvenient how are they restricting your oxygen intake?</p>
<p>And your closing statement..</p>
<p>&rt;I'm not going to make other people's health my responsibility.</p>
<p>So from a practical and moral point of view you don't think it's anyone's responsibility to do all they can to stop the spread of a rampant virus?</p>
<p>Now it's fairly obvious I have a different point of view on this subject from yourself but I really am trying to understand certain people's thought processes at this stage rather than just go straight into argument mode.
Thanks.</p>

        <p>Appreciate your well written reply, I'll hope to clarify your questions.</p>
<p>For me it is noticably different on how easy it is to breathe through these things..not much but the difference is there and on top of the feeling of my hot breath recirculating around my mouth and all the bacteria a mask harbors after just minutes of use it becomes a petri dish I don't want anywhere near my nose or mouth, furthermore I am not sick and therefore I'm not at risk of getting anyone else sick and if you argue that it's for my protection then I say it's my risk to take. </p>
<p>There's been a new big study out now debunking asymptomatic transmission which has already been speculated to be not a thing. </p>
<p>https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4695</p>
<p>As far as responsibility goes.. if you're sick or not feeling well, stay at home..that goes for any illness not just covid . I agree it's a douchebag thing to do to go out when you know you're sick even if you  Mask and distance. </p>
<p>Hope this makes sense and thanks for a healthy dialogue.</p>

        <p>Sure no worries, thank you for talking to me in grown up rational way .
The subject of asymptomatic transmission is obviously hot at the moment but this part of the problem for me.
You've say quite confidently that I'll give you that asymptomatic transmission has already been debunked
Where we getting up from?
Certainly not in that BMJ thing you sent me which is interesting for sure I admit but they do say that they can't extrapolate their specific findings across the board.</p>

        <p>Thereâ€™s a couple other articles I found too, the cdc official stance last I checked was that there is no proof to prove or disprove asymptomatic transmission. And the new medical journal from
The wuhan study that is trying to refute it seems like the science is going towards asymptomatic transmission not being a thing . I will admit I need to follow this more closely and keep abreast of all research</p>
