    <strong>about those people who quickly put on their mask when somebody walks by and then takes it off...</strong>
    <p><p>first started noticing this on hiking trails...people would see me and they would quickly put on their mask as we got closer. Young or old.  So many people in the Seattle area are afraid.</p>
<p>I think the "more traditionally educated (brainwashed)" you are, the stupider you are.</p>
<p>In my head I'm just thinking - ridiculous.</p>
<p>well I saw my sister for the first time in quite a while (2 years?) a few weeks ago and saw her doing the same - while we were sitting outside of a coffee shop. She was all defensive (She's like this anyway about a lot of things) when I noted it.</p>
<p>Today we met at a bakery cuz she was in town again on an impromptu visit to see another one of her friends. We are sitting in an indoors atrium area outside of the shop. As people walk by she quickly kept putting on and then taking off the mask. All the people who walked by were wearing masks. She did it a lot more than last time.</p>
<p>Of course, trying to talk about this she get's all defensive &amp; offensive.</p>
<p>She's like - "haven't you seen all the videos with karens who don't wear a mask." And on and on.</p>
<p>That's the first time I've ever heard someone use that word audibly.</p>
<p>I should note she's always had a very combative personality...much worse lately...but that's besides the point. She doesn't need to wear  a mask on a daily basis...because she's currently unemployed. And doesn't seem to have any sympathy for those who do wear a mask on a daily basis.  But that's also because we are like oil &amp; water since teen years pretty much. She always wants to fight me or prove her point even when there is no logic / substance to it.</p>
<p>This mask on and off behavior is quite _______  I don't even have a word for it.</p>
<p>Yet..she's okay flying. And she showed me a video of herself &amp; a friend at a restaurant, eating indoors. Presumably she was not taking on &amp; off the mask while other diners were around.</p>
<p>I didn't call her on that because I just thought of that.</p></p>

        <p>&rt; haven't you seen all the videos with karens who don't wear a mask</p>
<p>It bothers me that people are misusing the karen moniker so often.  A "karen" is the "I'd like to speak with the manager" type who wants to complain about things all the time and tell other people what to do.  People not wearing masks are in no way karens.  They just want to be left alone.</p>

        <p>"Karen" behavior is just generally entitled behavior.  To us, mask supporters are Karens because they feel the need to make the world cater to them.  To them, we're the Karens who feel like we can do as we please with zero regard for others.</p>

        <p>Yeah, that happens a lot where I live, too. I laugh out loud at people when they do that at seeing me approach with my proud, maskless face. A woman on the trail the other day actually had her mask in her hand and hurriedly pressed it to her face when she saw me. Her maskless husband greeted me enthusiastically, LOL.</p>

        <p>Seriously.  My husband and I are both anti-lockdown, anti-mask.  We're both compliant when inside public businesses, but no masks anywhere else.  (I don't care what our governor's latest rules are about outdoors; it's too hard to keep track of them, they change so often.  Outdoor transmission is barely a thing and I refuse to wear a mask while exercising.)  Having someone I live with who is also sane is part of what's keeping me from deep depression.  (Right now it's more like middle-of-the-road depression.)  But the people who are into the masks are often <em>obsessed</em> with COVID.  So, you know that guy and his wife go home and she's talking about COVID nonstop and making him wash everything and probably also withholding sex because she's too stressed out due to COVID.</p>

<p>Action - reaction is certainly part of it over many years. She has been my most difficult "enemy" shall we say.</p>
<p>But I've also learned a lot about who I am / who we are, over the years and I would classify myself as pretty observant. A lot more than I was before. I cringe a little thinking about my old SELF!  Extensive traveling and living in other countries has also been helpful.</p>
<p>I've made a lot of "wrong turns" over the years, so to speak,...but every dead end is one path I can cross of my list...soon I will be out of the maze!</p>

        <p>I only put my mask on walking by if someone else has theirs on, then snatch it off and roll my eyes afterwards. I’m a 5’1 petite young woman and I don’t want anyone starting shit. I already had a run in with an older guy, it was scary. But if they don’t have theirs on, or if they don’t wear it correctly I don’t wear mine. I also sneak and don’t wear it at work, not going to wear a mask for 7+ hours anymore. NOPE.</p>

        <p>I was in Eugene, OR from mid August to mid September. When we first arrived masks were optional and were also optional while passing through Shasta.  Several of the native American casinos had reopened against Newsom's orders.</p>
<p>By the time we left most of the people at Eugene's farmers market were wearing masks even though it is outside and still optional.  People were looking more and more scared every week we were there other than at our RV park.</p>
<p>I noticed people were most scared on the hiking trails which are situated near a well-to-do Eugene neighborhood.  </p>
<p>Here's another interesting demographic to watch because I fall into it.  I'm an alternative health food-is-medicine kind of person who happens to be healing my own eczema using alternative methods (thank god I never went on steroids, read a lot of stories about it, not good).  I know from personal experience the current Big Pharma dominated medical establishment isn't working for people so I guess I'm no longer "brainwashed" and I'm highly educated and even took microbiology and studied biology in college.</p>
<p>At the end of our stay the only place I felt comfortable was this little whole foods plant based food truck that was near a really decent coffee shop.  The owner of the truck was real casual about the mask thing as were a lot of his patrons.  The coffee shop owner told me they had a "health inspector" come in and chastise her for using real coffee cups even if they washed them in a scalding hot dishwasher.  I even had a really good conversation with a girl who like myself became disillusioned with the scientific academia and left instead of doing graduate work.  </p>
<p>Btw during our convo none of us wore masks, we even touched each other's hair because we both have long hair.  I remember the woman sitting behind her a few tables back looked very uncomfortable with us interacting like we normally would.</p>
<p>I hope I was helpful to her because I get her pain.  She studied in Ohio and said pretty much everyone in her department (she studied molecular biology I think with an emphasis on neurology or something like that) because she wanted to do research on plant medicines and they pooh poohed her. </p>
<p>I would say your observation that a high degree of education or class status does seem to correlate to high mask wearing.  The alternative health people like myself seem to have fallen into the not mask wearing group.</p>

        <p>This is where I'm at (edit:alt health liberal in conservative area). Except my more educated friends and coworkers are more anti-lockdown. The less educated liberal ones are most scared, but still willing to go along with whatever others are doing, either wearing masks or not. The conservative uneducated people in my life are wary of the tyranny and numbers and seek out open-minded smart people who can confirm their suspicions or answer their questions. At least this seems to be the trend where I am.</p>

        <p>My mother-in-law did this at Yellowstone when we were hiking or she'd hike with it on. Here in Virginia, the humidity gets so bad, my face turns beet red when I hike and strangers ask me if I'm okay, am I drinking water... I don't wear a mask while hiking yet she insisted everyone should. I feel stupid even facing away from people. And she's from Seattle.</p>
