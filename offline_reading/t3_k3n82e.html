<li>Lock down the entire country, force our kids to use a learning environment that is proven to be less effective, destroy umpteen thousands of small businesses, prevent people from getting needed medical care OR</li>

        <p>I don't know, that's a pretty big jump from what I said. I made no arguments about effective methods of controlling the coronavirus, just pointed out that comparing this number of deaths this year so far to the totals from other years without extrapolating does not make any sense whatsoever. </p>
<p>If you want some real analysis, you might also consider that the coronavirus only really started causing a substantial number of deaths in April, so that 1% is still an underestimation for the year. </p>
<p>Couple that with the fact that comparing total deaths in a year as a measure for the deadliness of the coronavirus in a stat only used by people who refuse to believe the virus actually kills people.</p>

        <p>The virus absolutely kills people.  I don’t think anyone disputes that.  The dispute is around how many people it kills and whether or not the “cures” being used (lockdowns, etc) are worse than the disease itself.</p>

        <p>I think that in this sub and many others, people do actually dispute that the virus kills people. Or they think that if someone died because they had cancer and then caught the virus, that that doesn't mean they died of the virus. Just because they already had something weakening their immune system doesn't mean they would have died that week if they didn't catch covid. </p>
<p>I'm not saying I advocate for strict lockdowns necessarily. I think there's a wide variety of strategies that could be employed but I think many governments, including Sweden, missed the mark, and as a result, they have one of the higher death rates in Europe</p>

        <p>I think it's more nuanced than that.  I think a lot of folks (including myself) think that many of the people who die from coronavirus already had other comorbidities and, arguably, were going to die anyway.  That's basically what the chart in OP's post is suggesting, in fact.  so then the question becomes what is the real impact of COVID, by itself, on a population.</p>
<p>To your point, it compares a partial year death count against full year numbers from previous years.  But if you do extrapolate, you end up with ~93k deaths for the full year.  Let's compare that against the average of all the previous years, which is something higher than 90k, but I'll use 90k to keep it easy.</p>
<p>So, if you agree with that logic, COVID killed an extra 3,000 people this year in Sweden.  Sounds like a lot, but Sweden has a population of 10MM people, so 3k is 0.03% of their population.</p>
<p>Does saving 0.03% of the population justify locking down the entire country?  Should 99.97% of the population have their livelihood and lifestyle massively impacted so that 0.03% of society doesn't die?    </p>
<p>It's a tough question to answer, certainly.  But it's not clear to me that Sweden "missed the mark", per se.    What do you think they should have done differently?</p>

        <p>First off I still don't think that's the best way to look at the death statistics but I'll leave that point for now. What it kind of comes down to is that human lives should mean more than statistics. Are you willing to call up an elderly grandparent, or your aunt who has cancer, or your dad with a heart condition and tell them that you think their heightened susceptibility means we shouldn't try to protect them from covid, and just let them die if they catch it? It's easily to say "well they might have died anyway even without covid" when you don't have a personal connection to the person. But a terminally ill cancer patient who found out they only have a year to live is going to be trying to live that year to the fullest. And you're essentially saying that because they're going to die anyway, it doesn't matter if they die this week or next year.</p>
<p>The same lack of empathy is the reason why lockdowns do end up needing to happen. Sweden tried to rely on voluntary measures, and they were somewhat effective, but it wasn't enough. And you can bet that "voluntary measures" in places like the US aren't going to do any good at all. We always have to play to the stupidest members of society. Since a chunk of the population isn't going to listen to semi-lockdown orders anyway, a full lockdown means some people will do more than their part to stop the spread and make up for the people not doing their part. It's ridiculous that that's how we have to tackle this, but when you refuse see beyond your own shadow, that's what happens</p>

<p>No, but I'm similarly not willing to lock down the entire country just to save them.  We are a society and we need to consider what's best for society as a whole - not a tiny sliver of it.  </p>
<p>To give you another example: it's inarguable that banning automobiles would save hundreds of thousands of lives each year.  No more car crashes, no more DUIs, no more pedestrians killed by inattentive drivers, etc.  So...should we ban automobiles?  Of course not - because automobiles provide a net benefit to society as a whole, even when it has a negative impact on a tiny sliver of the population.</p>
<p>To be clear: I'm not against taking precautionary measures.  I'm vehemently against full lockdowns.  Instead, I'd like to isolate and protect the at-risk population.  Give them dedicated shopping times where they can go out and get staples.  Subsidize delivery and home health care services so they can get more of their needs met without having to leave their homes.  Protect them from the disease because they're the only ones at significant risk from it.</p>
<p>Then, leave the rest of us alone so we can go about our daily lives.</p>

        <p>I feel like you're coming right back around to the same point I made though: no matter what rules are put in place, a substantial chunk of the population will refuse to follow the rules. "Oh what I can't get groceries from noon-2pm because that's seniors hour? Fuck that, I'm gonna go anyway"</p>
<p>I agree that in an ideal world, full lockdowns might not be necessary, but we don't live in an ideal world. In Canada and other places, seniors are dying at very high rates because of covid outbreaks in long term care homes. We can't even protect the people that we're already supposed to be protecting. Your ideas of protecting the vulnerable still all involve a high level of adherence to the rules from the general population, and until the population is willing to adhere, more extreme measures are the only thing that might make a dent.</p>
<p>Edit: and also, you're still kind of advocating for the more at risk members of society to live a less fulfilling life, just because you can't be bothered to slow your life down a bit to help them</p>

        <p>&rt; you're still kind of advocating for the more at risk members of society to live a less fulfilling life,</p>
<p>I'm advocating for a partial lockdown where the at-risk population refrains from going outside unless absolutely necessary.  Why wouldn't that be preferable to a full lockdown where everyone has to refrain from going outside unless absolutely necessary? </p>
<p>And, with a partial lockdown, I'd certainly support much stricter enforcement of that.  Asking people to stay home for a few hours a week, at specified times, is far less of a burden than asking folks to stay home all the time.  So, bring out the national guard, cops, etc. to help enforce it.</p>

        <p>Again, I agree that in an ideal world, something like this might work. Sadly, we just don't live in an ideal world.</p>
<p>This also still doesn't address certain issues though like long term care homes. If we let covid run rampant around the lower risk population, workers for these homes are bound to catch it and bring it into those homes. Should we expect those workers to fully isolate themselves as well? What about the grocery store employees that are working during the senior hours of shopping? How do we ensure they aren't infected with covid and spreading it around the store?</p>

        <p>But supposedly masks are the silver bullet, right?  So make them wear masks and the problem is solved.</p>
<p>Look - I'm not going to say my solution prevents <em>anyone</em> from dying from COVID.  I've been pretty clear that I'm fine with an appropriate balance.  Society has to continue to function, especially when only a tiny sliver of the population is really at risk.</p>
<p>Again, automobiles are a great example - we accept (and have for decades) a certain percentage of people dying every year because of the net benefit and utility that automobiles provides society overall.  Same rule should apply here.</p>

        <p>Ah but see we've only talked about deaths, we haven't even considered the 1/5 covid patients who have some sort of long term effects from the virus. So a "tiny sliver" really isn't at all true.</p>
<p>And we have been trying to make people wear masks all summer. Look how well that's turning out. Stupid is as stupid does</p>

        <p>So you keep shitting on every alternative proposal I make, so we’re basically left with the original two options that started this whole discussion: </p>
<p>• Lock down the entire country, force our kids to use a learning environment that is proven to be less effective, destroy umpteen thousands of small businesses, prevent people from getting needed medical care OR
 • Live life normally and accept a death rate that is ~1% higher than normal?</p>
<p>Unless you have something constructive to offer as an alternative?</p>

        <p>You mistake "shitting on" for pointing out the downfalls of. Hate to break it to you, but that's how real life works. You can't focus on one end goal without considering the collateral damage along the way.</p>
<p>I never claimed to have all the answers, but I'll repeat what I said before. Lockdowns become necessary because people don't have the mindfulness to follow looser restrictions put in place first</p>

        <p>I got completely different numbers. Help me out?</p>
<p>Nov. 13 = 318 days of the year</p>
<p>81,072 deaths by Nov. 13</p>
<p>81,072 / 318 * 356 = 90,760</p>
<p>Right? Which would put annual deaths right in average range.</p>
