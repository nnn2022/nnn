    <strong>We gotta stop downvoting the living shit out of people who come here with dissenting opinions.</strong>
    <p><p>Ever notice how they don’t delete the comment? Why do you think that is? </p>
<p>It’s for them to screen shot and say ‘look at all these assholes with no argument to offer’</p>
<p>You won’t shame people into changing their minds. Even if they delete the comment, that’s a dangerous form of self censorship that creates an even more echoey echo chamber.</p>
<p>How many of us came here and said ‘wow it’s nice to see like minded people’...I said that myself. And while it is nice to know that there are people out there that tend to think like me, it doesn’t make the people who don’t think like me go away and cease to exist.</p>
<p>So when they come here, we shouldn’t do the internet equivalent of a Karen SHOUTING YOU DOWN BECAUSE SHES RIGHT AND YOURE WRONG.</p>
<p>If they want to try and shame us out of their subs, fine. </p>
<p>But let’s not do that. </p>
<p>Literally all of this is OPINION. I don’t think we should upvote or downvote opinions. They’re all valid. If you agree, cool, if you don’t, cool. Hash that shit out in the comments. Just engage with them. If you have good points, they’ll see that. If they don’t think you have good points, maybe you don’t or maybe they just don’t think they’re good. It doesn’t matter. You can’t attempt to control what people think.</p>
<p>Just be civil, most of them are open to discourse. Some just want to stir shit up, but it’s readily obvious who is just fucking pushing buttons and who is willing to have a discussion.</p>
<p>Don’t engage inflammatory shit with more inflammatory shit. </p>
<p>TLDR: I’ve rewritten this twice now, trying to shorten it up to the salient points, and failing miserably.</p>
<p>Essentially, stop upvoting or downvoting opinions, it’s not gonna help anything, and it is likely to make things worse.</p></p>

        <p>If they came here with open minds looking for discussion, sure.  By and large, they don't.  They put together a post that sounds like an honest question and then either never return, or just spit hatred to any response.  I've tried really hard to engage some of them with carefully thought out posts, and not one in ten is actually here to really talk.  They won't see that we have good points, (or even, per the MIT study, have better data and analysis than they do) they're mostly just trolls,  So we downvote.</p>
<p>No, it isn't ideal, but neither is a bunch of wasted effort trying to talk politely with a troll.</p>

<p>There are plenty of ppl like me who agree with somethings on here but hate the utter illiteracy about science and medicine. There is borderline crystal healing levels of ignorance on here but it is attacked if you don't wholeheartedly agree with them.</p>
<p>This is a fairly unpleasant community.</p>

        <p>We have attracted some nut jobs, it's true.  I tend not to engage with "viruses aren't real, they haven't been proven to be contagious!" or other crazy types any more than I engage with "hey guys, I just have one honest question, why do you all believe what you do?  site sources pls."</p>
<p>r/LS definitely has better conversations, but even there you'll face pro-vaccine dogma.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate that disagreement is always perceived as unpleasantness, and much of the time expressed as such, but this is, after all, the internet, and anonymity breeds hostility.</p>

        <p>I actually find those nutters more palatable then those with a very strong opinion on, for instance, mRNA but have less than zero understanding of what it is. I would say that the latter group is bordering on a majority here. </p>
<p>Its really hard to have any form discussions when:
1. Ppl simply cannot debate
2. Anything they disagree with makes you a lefty
3. You are in the pockets of big pharma or big health if you know what even an antibody is
4. They are adamant they no more about your industry and profession than they do.</p>

<p>I think this might be life in general, we've just made it super easy with the internet, and easier with lockdowns where we really don't have to be confronted with anything different...ever.</p>
<p>There is a strong tendency to force anyone in to one of two buckets, us or them, and the second you deviate from their version of truth, you're in the other bucket, no matter how often you reiterate "lockdowns suck, masks suck, cuomo sucks."  It's not far from the religious zealotry everyone sees in "the enemy."</p>
<p>I've tried really hard to keep the links and sources of high quality by debunking the seemingly agreeable but poor quality links and arguments that keep resurfacing.  (Someone posted a set of annual death counts showing 2020 was low...but it was using data from early november, so of course it was.  Man the responses i got!)  It's really not worth the effort.  </p>
<p>Early on, the covid19 sub was able to have some pretty high quality science-focused discussions, but they went full hate a few months back, and I don't know anywhere else that is willing to accept that their ideas and conclusions on a given topic might actually be wrong, so discussion is impossible. (I'd love to find a real discussion about spike protein transmission via aerosols and the impacts if possible, but just suggesting the vaccines may not be wiping out humanity gets downvotes.)</p>
<p>The truth is pretty much no one in here understands a thing about biology or viruses, and finding those that do among those who claim so is tough, so the conversation simply can't be above a certain calibre.</p>

        <p>Coming in with a question/post that sounds well-intentioned and then leaving to get a bunch of wasted responses is hard to moderate, because it's hard to judge as trolling until later.</p>
<p>One type of trolling just wants to act like a child and get downvotes, but more sophisticated versions sow dissent, waste effort, dilute the message, etc.  It is a broad and well-practiced tradition at this point, and while not something in which I take part, has been in wide circulation for nearing 30 years online.  The most important (and oft-repeated) lesson has always been "don't feed the trolls."  This includes engaging with them.</p>

        <p>One: I don’t trust big pharma. Two: I’m young and healthy. Three: 99% survival rate. Four: I live alone so I’m not really worried about contaminating a loved one. Five: I see it as a personal liberty thing. Six: something about mRNA being messed with sounds way sketchy. Seven: I don’t want aborted babies in me. Eight: I feel that in public, social distancing is enough. Nine: I don’t like this talk about needing follow up injections. Ten: okay it’s serious sketches me out. Eleven: I can do my part to ‘stop the spread’ without vaccinating. </p>
<p>Basically, I dont trust it, I don’t think it’s necessary for me personally to take it, I don’t feel obligated to take it to protect a loved one (live alone), and I think other social distancing measures work fine. But the big take away is that I DO NOT trust it. I’m a victim of the opioid crisis bullshito so big pharma has done nothing to instill confidence in me and has done everything to betray my trust. In my eyes, they’re all profit drive mega corps who profit off suffering.</p>

        <p>If you lived with someone who was at risk would you get vaccinated? The only reason why I got vaccinated is because my university is requiring it. I’m like you, I’m a healthy college athlete who would be fine, but I don’t want to put either my grandma at risk nor my mother. Plus, one thing I do like about the mRNA vax is that it can be developed quickly (that’s one of the attributes of it). This was first developed in 2003, and I think if this vax gets FDA approved then we can be able to get vaxes that are MRNA</p>

        <p>I’d consider it more, yes. But I’d also be worried about the viral shedding after the vaccine. I think I’d still just social distance until I figured out a way to visit safely, maybe rapid tests if theyre affordable. </p>
<p>I can’t imagine having it be mandatory for me to take. </p>
<p>I think that last part is scary as well, that they’ll use this to finally get pushed through the mRNA sketchiness. </p>
<p>It feels suspicious to me.</p>
<p>But like I said, I’m so beyond distrusting of any and all pharmaceutical companies. The biggest part of big pharma is medication for livestock. Once I learned that. Pfft. No more meat. And I loved meat.  </p>
<p>Not saying that what Purdue did with oxycontin is indicative of the entire industry, but what they did is unforgivable. I’ve lost friends, it damn near killed me and I’ll be frank it fucked my life up.</p>

<li>
<p>mRNA is naturally found in your body, and once the mRNA from the vaccine creates the spike protein of the coronavirus, it becomes broken and unusable, meaning it can't infect you or cause any other direct harm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are no fetal cells or tissue in any vaccine. Fetal cell line means that there were cells taken from an initial abortion that were then used to reproduce new cells in a laboratory. <a href="https://www.nebraskamed.com/COVID/you-asked-we-answered-do-the-covid-19-vaccines-contain-aborted-fetal-cells">They are thousands of generations removed</a> from the initial cells from the fetus. So it would be like saying the cells of your 1000x-great-grandparents are in you because you are their descendant, which is an incorrect conclusion. If that still doesn't convince you, <a href="https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-ingredients/fetal-tissues">various vaccines that you likely already had</a> also come from the same fetal cell line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social distancing won't last forever. Eventually you will either come in contact with the virus and become infected (you will have that \~99% survival rate) or you can get the vaccine which greatly reduces the chance of hospitalization or death even further.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I want to let you know that I am totally fine with you being against the new vaccines, you have every right to be, I just thought I would clear up some inconsistencies.</p>
