    <strong>Our institutions of higher education have failed us</strong>
    <p><p>Really, I laugh. </p>
<p>As a 21 year old, obviously having recently graduated H.S, I decided to skip out on the college experience. I did so for several reasons - but of which, as per the nature of this sub, are more or less irrelevant. </p>
<p>I had always known that most of the big instituons were liberal / progressive dominated belief systems and teaching structures. I didn’t quite know the extent until receiving my own anecdotal. </p>
<p>I laugh because of the many stigmas associated with my current stage in life - you go to college and get smart. If you don’t, you’ll be dumb or average, and work a job that suffices. </p>
<p>I could press on about the above, but let’s not distort the intent of this post - expose how idiotic and sheepish many of my college-going-friends are. As such, let’s focus on one of the statements of stigma above.</p>
<p>&rt;You go to college and get smart.</p>
<p>Now, make no mistake. If you went to college, or are currently enrolled, this is not an attack on you. There are respective fields that require vigorous study, application, and so on. Fields that, really, only a handful of people can fulfill. </p>
<p>But see, there’s many measures of intelligence, and, in my own measure, in no way shape or form does going to college explicitly make you more intelligent. </p>
<p>The above is an important note because, playing along with the stigma of “going to college”, I think for many who do, feel to a degree, like their point of view - their assertion on a situation, should be granted with more validity. After all, they’re more “educated”. </p>
<p>As briefly touched, many of our instituons of higher education (here in the states) have a blatant liberal bias, and as such, the liberal bias seeps within the minds of many of the college-goers. </p>
<p>Being taught to hate, disregard, or grant less credence to whites (white privilege). Being taught political correctness and hate speech - or in other words, conforming to a breach of our first amendment right.</p>
<p>Those are only a couple instances of foul ideology being openly promoted to our many millions of young adults. </p>
<p>I digress - political polarization is at an all-time-high. Those of “higher education” are, quite literally, being drafted - recruited - into a machine of oblivious compliance. </p>
<p>This hadn’t merely set off alarm bells for me until I received my anecdotal. In a simple longing for discussion on various political matters, several of my old friends from high school (of which had branched off to local universities) not only didn’t want to be part of the discussion, but they went as far as outright removing me as friends from said social platform. And for what? Because I didn’t conform. I questioned - and there’s no room for that. </p>
<p>And now I backtrack sharply to the subject of higher education failing us. Where is the critical thought process in these individuals? Asking questions is the biggest step in the quest for thinking critically. </p>
<p>My worry grows as I come to new realizations about this slow-boiling cauldron of disinformation. </p>
<p>When I ponder back in world history, I find myself often going back to Germany in the early 1940’s. Do people even ask how Hitler was able to brainwash and manipulate all the nazi’s into carrying out orders? Because certainly no sane person would have. But certainly, they couldn’t have all been insane? No. </p>
<p>The case in point here is blind conformity. People had a reason to be upset - a figure took advantage of the situation, and simply shifted that aimless hatred and anger to a target. With blind compliance, (obviously you don’t want to be the only one thinking wrongly), you end up with thousands of young men willing to horrifically massacre millions of innocent lives. </p>
<p>The case in point in our modern era here is, again, blind conformity. People <em>are</em> upset. A figure (the media) is actively taking advantage of the developing situation, and slowly are starting to target “Trump supporters”, aka, those not aligned with the liberal agenda. Blind compliance is plentiful, and many of these instances are developing in our institutions of higher education. </p>
<p>In other words, and to summarize this briefly - colleges across the nation are discreetly recruiting young men and women to be the conformants of a cultural war developing as I type this. Earlier this year, the goal was simple - make it taboo to oppose the general narrative. In the past month or two, we’re starting to see the suppression of a target (anyone opposing the narrative, namely republicans), as well as blatant conformity. Discord willing to be shut down on massive scales. Show your democratic friends proof of fraud, of ineffective masks, of covid-19 being a skimpy Flu - they won’t hear it. </p>
<p>This is a very dangerous time unfolding. There’s many moving pieces. The media, in combination with our educational institutions, are actively recruiting 21st century Nazi’s to carry out the new reich. And every day, more and more of these people are willing to hear less and less of your opposition.</p></p>

        <p>Universities cannot fail you. Universities are made for adults, not kids, they are not responsible for not failing you. I believe this is the main part of the problem - the expectation that the universities should replace parents, and the notion that people still need parents at 18 years old (old enough to die in wars). Basically, once you promote university professors into parents, they feel that too, and they start parenting, "bringing up the next generation". And they start to teach you morals, which means basically just projecting their morals on you, and this is where you start to complain that those are not the morals you would like, and 'they failed you'. </p>
<p>Basically, because life is so safe nowadays, people started extending their childhood into the 20s, and this is how we ended up with people who graduated with bogus degrees. You can't go into an adult life with a kindergarten diploma (gender-aware wickerweaving major). </p>
<p>I think this will evovle into the full blown student loan crisis, and these young people will be the new proletariat who has nothing to lose but their student loans. Fun. </p>
<p>But don't get sucked into this. Think for yourself. This is entirely self-inflicted. No one forces you to go to university, and no one forced them as parenting figures for you. Get a non-political major, do your homework, don't talk about your personal life on campus.</p>

        <p>Yes, I’d agree with a lot of what you said here.</p>
<p>Really I was just aiming to provide an overview of the situation - we can talk about what we should do when our kids get sent to university, but that won’t change the current state. That won’t change the fact that, an overwhelmingly large percent of these young adults, adopt the majority belief of the institution. </p>
<p>And further, and really the point I was making, is that you can train your kid to carry out their own values, morals, and so on. But most of these people - most of these, obviously hypothetical, to-be-peers, willingly adopt the established belief system. From there, it will take an amount of self discipline and self righteousness to not blindly conform to the masses that will undoubtedly be there.</p>

<p>Yeah. Completely disagree. They will tell you what they think you should expect. Their version of reality and what actually happens in business are often radically different. </p>
<p>&rt;You can't go into an adult life with a kindergarten diploma (gender-aware wickerweaving major). </p>
<p>This is exactly an example of Universities or Colleges utterly failing to prepare someone for real life. Those courses and degrees are designed to promote stupidity over practicality. </p>
<p>The rest of your argument is pretty decent. Cheers.</p>

        <p>How would universities know "what actually happens in business"? The universities are made up from people who didn't find their place in business, everyone knows that. And even if they did, why would you expect them to tell you the truth? Again, you are making universities a parenting figure. 'Universities need to teach us the truth about life and care for our best interest', like who do you think they are, your mom?</p>
<p>They pretend they gatekeep the knowledge, even though you can find all the same information online. The real value they provide is a systematic approach to learning, and soon the competition will arise on that front. Already, most of the knowledge in tech doesn't involve universities. With covid online learning, there will even be less difference between university and google search, and google search doesn't charge tuition. However, to leverage the out-of-university free learning, you need to be a self-sufficient adult, and self-sufficient adults rarely end up in bogus programs, they are rarely 'failed' (victimized) by universities, they go in-and-out, and they don't get involved in the lesbian-of-color poetry club.</p>
