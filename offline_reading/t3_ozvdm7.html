    <strong>We must arm ourselves for ideological battle</strong>
    <p><p>I want to wade into the public discourse in my community, but I'm wary (as many of us are) of being placed into the "anti-vaxxer/Trumper/covidiot" box and quickly dismissed.</p>
<p>What I want are authoritative/normie sources supporting the following argument: Government mandated vaccination is authoritarian, and authoritarianism is harmful to society/humanity.</p>
<p>The front lines of this ideological battle, as I see it, are appeals to authority, appeals to the majority, and ad hominem attacks. I believe we need to undercut these strategies by presenting irrefutable truth. We need to get past that front line. Please join me in creating a list of certifiable, credible, logical, concrete information to arm ourselves with. </p>
<p>I had erroneously believed that social media influencers who claimed to be Marxist, socialist, leftist, anti-fascist, antiwar people, speaking truth to power, fighting for a fair society, fighting for equal representation, believed in those principles. I thought I was a part of the online majority that believed in human rights and dignity above all. But those values were a facade. The facade has washed away and most have fallen in line with the neoliberal status-quo. </p>
<p>In my own province, state media gives platform to professors who want to segregate the unvaccinated, in a community with virtually no covid whatsoever and an 80%+ vaccination rate. Unvaccinated people are being otherized, scapegoated, and dehumanized. People call them dirty, diseased, and gleefully fantasize about mass death of the unvaccinated. There is no mainstream opposition to this fascist rhetoric. I need to become that opposition. You need to be that opposition in your community. </p>
<p>We can work together to compile our argument, we can lean on eachother, and we can go forward with confidence in our values. </p>
<p>Suggestions: </p>
<p>Quotes from historical figures on power/authority in society</p>
<p>precedent for government/pharmaceutical industry abusing the public.</p>
<p>Literature from human rights organizations.</p>
<p>Evidence/precedent of media censorship (ongoing and past)</p>
<p>Whatever you think is useful documentation.</p></p>
