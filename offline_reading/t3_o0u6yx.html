    <strong>Long term effects of this hoax and power grab!</strong>
    <p><p>This hoax had damaged the words science, vaccine, mask, policy, and mandate. Those will be words that for then next 100 years won't be trusted. And rightly so. Science has been used as the strong arm of this hoax. And is responsible now for the inhumane treatment of mankind.
     Who will trust needles, hospitals, doctors, clinics, blood donations,  health boards, and mayors? Emplyees will no longer flood or trust managers, and corporations will be boycotted for their involvement and every manager who made people mask and read the box knowing they were useless. Our entire society has been damaged..... maybe thats a good thing. Maybe it will demand it be built better and more security if rights, more limits on companies, and government? Its a possible future.  I can only hope.</p></p>

        <p>I think you're being optimistic.</p>
<p>I do agree it will set back vaccines and trust in doctors.</p>
<p>We all know politicians and the higher levels of corporations are the lowest of scum, with no morality or concern for the common people. That's so well-established and proven it's a fucking cliche.</p>
<p>But the real damage - for me at least - is seeing what spineless, pathetic COWARDS are doctors.</p>
<p>The blatant corruption at the WHO will hopefully, discredit that disgusting org forever, so that's nice. But I'm talking more general doctors. The people we interact with often, the guys n gals we turn to for medical advice and trust with our health.</p>
<p>They have proven themselves willing to turn blind eyes and deaf ears to studies on HCQ and IVM, to push ahead and encourage injecting past your defences an experimental vaccine, for a disease no worse than the flu for most people.</p>
<p>They have continued their active and passive participation even as the disease has proven stupidly mild, even as the tests and testing have proven beyond flawed and outright criminal.</p>
<p>And they continued, even as the vaccines have proven the most dangerous in history, especially dangerous for younger people with life-long heart damage?</p>
<p>And now they're continuing as they come for the children?</p>
<p>Any respect I had for someone with the title 'Dr' has now reversed.</p>
<p>Fucking disgusting!</p>
