        <p>That cop should not have touched her and he should release the minute she started raising her voice.</p>
<p>I feel she would have been well within her rights to turn around and push that cop away but of course, if that happened she would have been arrested</p>
<p>Now do this to a full-grown man and most likely he will resist now most people would turn around to resist which would be a mistake it would give him a lot of time to see what you are doing and that is never good to do when someone is in an advantageous situation ie hands-on behind you... </p>
<p>Personally considering his left hand was on her left shoulder I would have crossed onto my left shoulder with my right hand while simultaneously grabbing his right hand resting on my right elbow with my left hand if I could wedge any of his fingers on his left hand on my shoulder between my palm and the bottom of my fingertips I could break them in one swift motion it would be easiest with the pinky.</p>
<p>The problem would be containing his other hand the inevitable knee in the back that's gonna come and the other two officers never forget police officers in groups just like gangs...</p>
<p>Resisting is rarely worth it cops do it cause they know when they get physical with people it pisses them off... Literally, no reason to od it in this situation..</p>

        <p>Yes, it’s obvious the police levied an accusation. Was that accusation true? No. Please watch the video again, and listen to everything that’s said. They paid for their items. That’s why they walked away free at the end. They did nothing wrong.</p>

<p>They didn’t shoplift, and that’s why they were not arrested. It’s quite simple.</p>
<p>That police officer putting his hands on a woman he has no right to detain was pretty disgusting to watch and my heart aches to hear her pain. She has a right to be secure in her personhood. </p>
<p>They never shoplifted. Repeating a falsehood doesn’t change the facts presented in the video. Get. Over. It.</p>

        <p>They paid for the items.  Once outside, the clerk gave their money back and said he wanted the items back because they weren't wearing masks.  The lady said she would give the items back if he would give a statement to her in writing that they weren't serving her because she wasn't wearing a medical device. </p>
<p>That's the way I understood it.  Not exactly shoplifting, but both parties could have handled it better.  Obviously the store should have sent them walking as soon as they entered without masks if they did not intend to serve them.</p>
