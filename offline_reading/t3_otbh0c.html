    <strong>Not against vaccines, I just don’t want to be experimented on...</strong>
    <p><p>I don’t consider myself to be “antivaxx”. I believe many shots have been successful in reducing or eradicating some illnesses. But I firmly believe in rules for consent, such as those defended by the Nuremberg Code; and what I see going on is clearly violating those laws. It seems to me that mass histeria is what drives people to voluntarily get vaccinated; fear of dying, losing their jobs and right to travel… It doesn’t seem to me to be a choice that comes from freedom. 
From what I observe, the state and media has been the biggest contributing factor in spreading panic amongst us. But I do not fear the virus; I’ve actually already contracted it last year and my healthy body dealt with it just fine. I am 26 years old, no underlying health issues. Never have gotten any flu shots in my life and have survived all. I do not fear death. I trust my body.
For those at risk, by all means, do what your heart desires. But please, respect my choice to wait. I don’t want to be coerced into being experimented on with a brand new type of vaccine. Thank you.</p></p>

        <p>Exactly. I've had prior vaccines that have been properly tested but this clot-shot is a real time experiment that I simply don't wish to take part in.</p>

        <p>Me too. And I have also gotten approved vaccines (Gardasil) and have presented symptoms only A MONTH AFTER the shot. Symptoms that were supposed to be covered... But no, they justify it by saying "it saves you from 90% of strains", while not taking the time to test the strain my body has contracted. It's hard for me to believe in such a coincidence, which is why I am very skeptical towards new vaccines.</p>

        <p>There was a quote last month in this sub-</p>
<p>This is what's actually happening-
The companies that make these vaccines are asking us all to bet our lives on something they won't bet their companies on.</p>

        <p>True I was Vaccinated against many things in the past and they were trusted ones. I am not taking this experimental shit, plus now out of spite towards pushing it on people, constant advertisement.</p>
