    <strong>How do you deal with the insanity?</strong>
    <p><p>A much more toned-down version of a rant I posted earlier.</p>
<p>This whole situation has been going on for what, 18 months now? I see lots of posts in this sub about protests and such, but then I leave my home and see the reality here in America. On the TV, internet and radio - advertisements for vaccines. Billboards and signs telling me to take the jab. People everywhere voluntarily masking. I'm surrounded by people who eat up every word spoken by the CDC.</p>
<p>I'm fortunate that my father thinks just like me, so I have that bit of sanity in the world, but even with that, I just don't know how to handle this much longer. I used to be incredibly kind, going out of my way to help people. Now, I don't do so because so many people would turn on me just because the government told them to do so.</p>
<p>How do you all handle this? How do you live in a world that thinks you're insane, and a growing number of people view you as the enemy? I know these people aren't my enemy, the corporations and government are, but that doesn't help when Mask Karen^TM is screaming at me, or Jab Nazi keeps asking me for my ~~papers~~ vaccination card.</p>
<p>How do you stay sane in an insane world? How do you live and work with people that you can't be certain won't turn on you when told to do so?</p></p>

        <p>Lie about being vaccinated. Fuck their stats. Any statistician can make anything look good or bad with proper placement of numbers on a graph.</p>
<p>Remember that a lot of the same people that are demanding you get vaccinated regardless of whether or not you want it, are people that would scream in your face if you brought up "my body, my choice," and the abortion argument as a rebuttal. Everybody who has gotten the jab is an adult who has considered this contradictory reality, and they've decided that their morality can allow for loopholes if given enough press exposure.</p>
<p>They'll be the ones who have regrets for the rest of their lives if the vaccine ends up having long term side effects, or when the virus does eventually conclude and they realize they showed their true colors to the real people, and the real people didn't like what they saw. Take it all as a blessing to see what people are willing to sacrifice friendship for justifying their own shitty behavior. People love to act like assholes, and it's up to their own consciousness to behave better for the actual good of mankind. Taking experimental vaccines that work so well that they still allow the vaxxed to get sick again is not a destiny that your whole life lead up to, and these people would love to make fun of all of us saying things like, "you all think your destinies are to refuse this vaccine." Textbook projection.</p>
<p>We all know that trolls love to come in here and write either paragraphs about how despicable we are, or shitty one-liners about how we don't believe science. It's the same buzz words they've used since day 1 of the pandemic. They use them because it gives them the sense of entitlement they need to avoid self reflection.</p>
<p>We're all in this together. Ignore trolls. You're not insane, EVERYONE always has been. Some people are just extra insane now</p>

        <p>It's definitely challenging, I've never felt more anxious and hopeless in my life than I do now. But every time I interact with someone else who sees what's going on it encourages me. Everytime I see a big protest, people refusing to go along with this it lifts me up and lets me know I'm not alone. There are times though when I have to stay off the computer and not listen to the news. Go for a walk, cook something delicious, watch a funny movie etc. And I know that this will eventually come to an end. Whether that end is bad or good or somewhere in between no one knows at this point. All I can do is stay true to myself and try to find little things to keep me sane. And know that you are not alone, there are millions and millions of people who see what this is. Do we really think millions and millions of people are all wrong? That we don't all have legitimate reasons to push back against this? The times when I question myself and feel overwhelmed I think about that. And just take it a day at a time, try not to think too much about the future even though it's impossible to do sometimes. It's just going to lead you down a very bad path mentally. Do what you can do today and hope for the best.</p>

        <p>You have to disconnect from it.  Leave your phone on the table next to your bed for a couple days only checking occasionally to respond to real humans and personal connection over text or call.  No news, no Reddit, no internet. Just be present in the world. </p>
<p>Go camping. Go fishing. Be in nature. Workout. Dive into your hobby or a new project you have been thinking about.  All of that is grounding and very necessary in this twilight zone world</p>

        <p>I block the instanity out, I don't try to pretent I'm their friend. I do my job and get out. I do not trust people blindly and above all, I do my own thing.</p>
<p>That's all, nothing really to it. Trust yourself, build a good and loving relationship with yourself, find your goals and do your thing. Have a contingency plan prepared, so If the shit hits the fan, you know what to do. Personally, I keep a bag full of camping equipment under my bed so I can always just take it and go where my legs take me.</p>

        <p>It’s decreases your chances of getting it, and your symptoms are not as bad if vaccinated. Also the reason it’s still spreading is because viruses mutate, and since y’all are too baby to wear a fucking piece of cloth on your face, it mutated and the vaccine that’s been developed is now less effective against these mutations</p>

<p>Did it mutate because we didn't wear masks, or because that's what viruses do? You've claimed both.</p>
<p>I'll save you the trouble. Viruses mutate because that's what viruses do. That's why the flu vaccine is different every year - because it's a coronavirus, and it <em>mutates</em>.</p>

        <p>Research on coronaviruses =/= research on vaccines.</p>
<p>And you're right, millions have gotten the shot. Just check out all the complaints people have after getting the shot. I've been a pin cushion for the military, gotten countless jabs for stuff, didn't even know what half of it was, and I still have never had more than isolated soreness around the injection site. People having fevers and being in pain from vaccines IS NOT NORMAL.</p>
