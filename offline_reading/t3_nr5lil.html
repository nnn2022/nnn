    <strong>Questions that nobody is asking</strong>
    <p><p>I made a throwaway to post here; I have a couple of questions that neither the vaxxers nor anti-vaxxers seem to be asking with regard to mRNA-based "vaccines".</p>
<p><strong>1a)</strong>  Does anyone know how the dosage is controlled in the mRNA vaccines? Suppose the mRNA coding for the spike protein just doesn't disintegrate in some cells for a while, does that mean your cell just keeps pumping out spike protein for weeks on end? Is the half-life of the mRNA fragment the only thing controlling dosage?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>1b)</strong> Supposing the vaccine mRNA doesn't have a self-destruct mechanism and has to disintegrate before cells containing the mRNA fragment go back to regular activity, are there any studies on the specific spike protein being encoded for? There is emerging evidence that the specific spike protein in all the Western vaccines is itself somewhat pathogenic.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>1c)</strong> Why do all the vaccines produce the same spike protein? Wouldn't it be more advantageous, both from an individual immunological perspective (if the spike protein could be pathogenic) as well as herd immunity perspective for the vaccines to target different antigens? To put it more simply, if there are any other proteins exposed on the virus shell, wouldn't those be equally effective as an antigen to train the immune system to recognize the virus as a foreign substance and create an antibody to? Are we supposed to believe there are no other proteins on the virus shell besides the spike, and is there any evidence to suggest that?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>1d)</strong> Isn't it stupid from a viral evolution standpoint to try to achieve immunity by having the majority of the population have the exact same antibody? For example, if 70-90% of the population has the exact same antibody because they all were only exposed to the same antigen (the spike protein in the vaccine), all the virus has to do is evolve a different cellular entry mechanism than the spike protein and we're back at square one with a population with 0% immunity.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong>  How do we know reverse trascriptase won't convert the mRNA fragments into DNA that can become part of the cell's genome, or even more alarmingly, part of the DNA of a sperm or egg cell? There's evidence that viruses did this in the past in our own DNA, e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X31g5TB-MRo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X31g5TB-MRo</a>; paleo-virology as a field couldn't even exist but for mRNA being reverse transcribed into germ cells. What stops this from happening with the vaccines, and if it does happen, didn't we just accidentally doom our species to create a pathogenic antigen from birth?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> What stops other viruses and bacteria from uptaking the spike protein encoding mRNA? I know the injection site is the arm muscles which are less likely to be exposed to exogenous pathogens than say lung epithelial tissue. However, the JnJ vaccine is adenovirus-based, and I believe the pfizer variant uses a plastic. Either way, both these vaccines are engineered to inject mRNA into a cell; what if that cell isn't human but a bacteria and now we have a bacteria strain manufacturing spike protein? Viruses also exchange mRNA with each other, meaning a much more deadly virus than sars-cov-2 could "borrow" the mRNA for the spike protein cell entry mechanism, and possibly become more contagious as a result.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>All in all it seems to me like we're so concerned with <em>can</em> we make an mRNA-based vaccine that we're ignoring whether we <em>should</em> make it.</p>
<p>edit: formatting, phrasing, added a youtube link and context</p>
<p>edit2: it's actually quite funny seeing how quickly this gets up/downvoted. Apparently asking questions Fauci MBUH hasn't answered is somewhat alarming for those who haven't passed Biology 101. At the same time, why isn't Rand Paul, allegedly Our Guy™, asking these questions? They're both "Doctors" and I took AP biology in high school back when Pluto was a planet; these questions shouldn't be hard to answer (supposing the vaccine really is SaFe n' EfFeCtiVe)</p>
<p>edit3: Pluto deserves capital P. Fight me.</p></p>

        <p>I have no answers to your questions other than speculation. Instead I have a question myself:</p>
<p>How does triggering the immune-system to produce a specific kind of anti-body, in this case anti-bodies to neutralize the spike-proteins, impact it's ability to deal with other pathogens?</p>
<p>The way I think about the immune-system, it must have some limits to it's resources and can do only so many things at once.</p>
<p>I would think that putting all your resources onto dealing with one thing would certainly lower it's capabilities to deal with other threats.</p>
<p>In this case, where there is supposed to be a constant stream of antigens for an, as you have pointed out, unknown period of time, I'd suspect a higher vulnerability to other antigens for that same unknown period of time.</p>
<p>And on a broader, more meta-level: How do we know that anything we are being told about how viruses and the immune-system interact is not just a gross oversimplification of what actually happens on a biochemical level or even works like the say at all?<br>
The book "Whole" suggests that there's a tendency in medicine to over-simplify how our bodies work. That diseases rarely, if ever have a single cause&amp;effect where substance A does this and substance B does that.<br>
Instead it suggests that there's hundreds of thousands of different biochemical mechanisms at play at once that work together for one outcome.<br>
That claiming to "know" what happens when you mess with exactly one aspect of the "whole" is rather naive and there's a big chance that your interference can have severe unexpected side-effects.</p>
<p>If for example, the immune-system is made to deal with viruses as a whole, how can we really know what effect it has to have it deal with only a part of it?</p>

        <p>lol, stop with the good scientific questions...shhhh!!! that's too much thinking for people including Fauci. Remember, the only things we need to know about the vaccine are 1. we should get it, for patriotism, for grandma, for yourself and OTHERS; 2) you really should get it and if you don't you will probably be made to anyway 3) I mean, it was just a piece of cloth, what's the big deal with an injection of random crap? Don't be selfish. just take the vaccine and don't think</p>
