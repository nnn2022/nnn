    <strong>Anyone watch “Your Honor”?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m watching the newest episode of Your Honor, and notice there are 2 people wearing masks. I’m pretty sure this show is supposed to have taken place prior to the COVID pandemic, so it’s strange. What’s also strange is that the camera seems to linger on the people with the masks. It almost seems like they added these scenes in after everything else was completed. Why would they do that?</p></p>

        <p>Was this show filmed before coronavirus came along?</p>

        <p>Just looked it up. Part of it was filmed before covid. Part during. However, it seems like some kind of virtue signaling or something with the masks. There’s a room full of people and only 2 people in the entire episode are wearing masks. The camera focuses on one woman as she puts hers on, and the camera seems to linger on the one juror that has one on. The juror keeps being shown front and center of the shots. 
Also odd - when the juror wants to speak, she takes off her mask. I’ve noticed this in real life as well, which makes me wonder why a person who genuinely believes masks save lives would remove theirs to speak.</p>

        <p>That is really odd. And eerie. It feels like someone deliberately wrote in the masked people because they knew masks would soon be pushed and this was a way of subconscious introduction.</p>

        <p>The focus on the mask was so obvious, it ended up distracting me from the storyline.</p>
