        <p>In high school I was taking a US History course, and we were learning about a court case from when the United States was a British colony. A man was arrested for publishing dissenting information against the crown, and the judge ordered the jury to vote guilty if his remarks were disparaging to the government. The teacher asked the class, "if you were on the jury, how many would vote guilty?" Literally everyone raised their hand except for me. The teacher asked "how many people would vote not guilty?" I raised my hand and the teacher asked "you would defy a judge?" I said yes, and the teacher said "you'd have twelve other people agreeing with you because the jury voted not guilty." The scary part was that a lot of people in the class seemed confused by this. They just didn't understand that defying a judge was the right thing to do.</p>

        <p>In high school I was taking a business course as an elective and the teacher mentioned something about Desert Storm. A student raised his hand and asked "what is Desert Storm?" The teacher asked in a really condescending voice, "you don't know what Desert Storm is?" The student said no, and the teacher basically made the student feel like an idiot for not knowing what Desert Storm was. I also didn't know what Desert Storm was, but I didn't say anything.</p>
<p>A few years later, when Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson asked "what is Aleppo" it reminded me of what happened in high school.</p>

        <p>I remember the Aleppo thing.  It was such a stupid question to ask.  He should've replied with something regarding being more concerned about what's happening in America than what's happening in the middle east.  Because, as an American, I could give 3 shits about Aleppo.  Yes, the world has problems, so do we.  We need to focus on our own nation before others.  It's so stupid that that's a controversial statement.</p>

        <p>I read it a few months ago, so reading it now is reading it again.</p>
<p>This time I’ll share what came to mind. </p>
<p>Abusive situations have been a norm in life. I’ve also experienced supernatural events. In both of those sorts of circumstances one practice was found useful, in common—when those I was around were not “safe” and when matters I’d witnessed were hard to be believed…sometimes the surest means of maintaining resolve and clarity of mind while under duress…was to make a solid, <em>private</em> test and retest of reality and stay resolved, silently. Then, I would sometimes leave myself notes (obliquely), but never speak of things unless in company which was safe (who were kind and whose judgment had been proven sound). </p>
<p>Knowing and being unable to effectually share an uncommon truth is the sort of isolation many of us here know intimately now. And I’m not recommending silence for us, in the above comments: We’re witnessing a sort of global, glorified genocide with the shots right now: so by whatever means, whenever possible we should be open about what we know is true regardless of unpopularity—maintaining compassion and wisdom of discretion (some people and places would just be a bar-fight, otherwise—as God gives leave to you, I guess…but I certainly would not want that). </p>
<p>I’m just saying that in the middle of an onslaught—when there seems to be no recourse, and when there seems no solidarity nor room for reasonable dialogue to exercise critical thought—I have continually found it is better to hold my peace and refrain from wasting words that may later be twisted against me in attempts to either harm me (if even by casting doubt on what I have every good cause to resolutely rest in knowing is true—having tested thoroughly, and/or knowing first-hand).</p>
<p>This approach has been refined a bit since I have come to know Jesus Christ, to greater clarity and resolution in exercise of discretion. Abuse is still periodic, if different, and I still experience the miraculous: Neither are continual, but real-time nonetheless. I have learned the core need is to settle a matter fully within my own heart and mind, before speaking—seek truth out, continue to test the limits, don’t cease weighing what’s actual. And some matters aren’t for sharing, after all that while. Each to each though, as far as what’s appropriate and where.</p>
<p>In any case, be convinced in your own mind of what you know to be true. Again, test matters privately and extensively, by all means available. But don’t necessarily start off entering a hostile situation by making your vulnerability apparent (unless that somehow seems best?).</p>
<p>And this is all a bit haphazard, for which I apologize.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: When under assault, there’s sometimes wisdom in silence. .. Know what you know, resolutely: know why you know it to be true, then speak as applicable. Continue to grow in knowledge.</p>

        <p>While this is true, you can only be aware of abuse and withstand it for so long. You alone won't be able to hold out indefinitely while living in the same environment you are being abused in. </p>
<p>It's extremely difficult. That's why many abused people don't even realize they've been abused until later in life, when the truth and pain from your subconscious rears its ugly head up as it tries to resolve itself. In that sort of environment you conform to survive. </p>
<p>You often don't even remotely process it as abuse, that ironically IS your normal. I know this firsthand like you, and you can read the ending of Brave New World to get a grasp of this aspect as well. </p>
<p>We either give up the inch/mile now and relent, or we keep our boundary firm and push back NOW. NOW is going to determine what direction we as a globe will head in, assuming they don't straight out pull the power from us and everyone else.</p>
