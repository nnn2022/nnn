    <strong>Local school district requiring masks for all students and staff.</strong>
    <p><p>I don't have any connections to this mainly because I don't have kids nor am I teacher, but a local school district decided today, no matter the grade or vaccination status all kids must wear a mask at all times, except during lunch, while in the school building.</p>
<p>I feel bad for the kids, because I saw how bad and sad they looked coming out of school last year wearing those muzzles and they were told since June that they wouldn't need em, then the school turns around and goes "NOPE YOU WEAR MUZZLES" 3 days before the school year starts....</p>
<p>I don't understand why they would wait this long to tell the kids and teachers because teachers are pissed as well because not only were they required to get the clot shot they also have to wear muzzles again.</p>
<p>If they do PE this year, it's gonna suck for that school district.</p></p>

        <p>As a parent, I think it’s one of two things or a combination of both. Either they were waiting for someone else (like the state) to officially mandate masks so that they wouldn’t have to make the decision themselves &amp; piss off the parents OR……they already made their decision &amp; waited until the last minute to announce because $$$$$. The last minute decision gives parents less time to pull their kids out and make other schooling arrangements. The schools funding is determined by their enrollment numbers. I think it’s safe to say that every public school district in the country has already lost kids to home schooling and private schools so they are getting less money. My kids district and every other one in the country is doing the same thing with masks-required indoors but not outdoors. They announced it 3-4 weeks in advance though.</p>
