    <strong>How does the BLM protests tie in with everything else going on?</strong>
    <p><p>The riots that are likely to take place in the coming weeks after the likely Chauvin acquittal.... How do they tie in with the lockdowns, the mask bullshit, and vaccines? </p>
<p>Will the protests be used an excuse to implement martial law or nationwide lockdowns?</p></p>

        <p>Depends on your race and background. I've seen them saying vaccine hesitancy from black and/or lower income class people is understandable and normal because of history but then when I (white/financially stable) say I won't get it I'm suddenly ... Racist. Somehow. I forget the exact reason that makes me racist but it was a <em>real</em> argument about people that don't get it are racist.</p>

        <p>I am Asian so they probably will think i'm racist too for having that opinion but I think I can't blame them it's the media brainwashing their minds they made it look for being against all this is right wing by calling anti lockdown protesters alt right/ far right and then they start to make a political connection and call you a racist because they think you are right wing for having that opinion and the media framed it as racist.</p>
<p>You can counter this by saying you're a leftist and their brain will start to malfunction.</p>

        <p>We’ve seen that many big cities have tolerated the violence caused by BLM. Remember last year when this whole situation was labeled a “public health crisis” and that it was important to go out and demonstrate? All while for the 3 months prior they were telling us never to leave our homes... Yeah, that was the tipping point of the COVID hypocrisy for me.</p>

        <p>Many things can be related and correlate, but it doesn't mean there is conspiracy about it.</p>
<p>Things memeify themselves with subtle mechanisms.</p>
<p>But sure there are authors who encourage anarchy and polarization.</p>

        <p>The definition of conspiracy is a group planning something negative in secret. Its not a conspiracy if they openly admit it.</p>
<p>Its actually quite ingenious they way they manage things and it reminds me in many way of H. G. Wells book "The Open Conspiracy". They make most of their goals fully public on their own websites but pay (or threaten?) mainstream media and their editors to look the other way. The result is that the public don't know somethings happening, but it's not actually secret at all until such times where things are too far along to be stopped.</p>
<p>I'll give a few examples, the newspapers berated and ridiculed people talking about the Bildeberg conference or Agenda 21 for years until their profile was raised because of the work of known conspiracy theorists. Then the media reported it as a matter of fact, as if they had always spoken about it.</p>

        <p>A good BLM riot is months of hard work of volunteers, organizers, police officials and special services. It takes months to set up the right agents that will allow Biden to semi-control the riot (about as good as he controls his bladder), it takes time to build up the emotional angst (you can't smash windows if you are not <em>feeling</em> it). I am very much against rioting, but I acknowledge all the work that goes into organizing one. </p>
<p>This is why the riot dates were widely published (Derek Chauvin trial), and it was announced that no matter the verdicts riots will happen (you can't suddenly cancel something you've been preparing for months just because the judge made a wrong verdict).</p>
<p>They scheduled the riots at a time that makes sense. We were locked up all winter, in May we'll be free and vaccinated, isn't it the time to remind that even though we won against covid, we will NEVER combat racism and climate change. </p>
<p>Also, notice that feminists all got laid off because of their inability to riot. Pink hat marhes didn't do what BLM managed to do. Linda Sarsour and Anita Sarkeesian collect unemployment now.</p>

        <p>I don't think Chauvin will be acquitted, and even if he is I doubt the riots will be as bad as last summer</p>

        <p>There were plenty of cops who killed people in a way less ambiguous situations. Also, there were plenty of victims with less drug/criminal lifestyles. Why did George Floyd family recieve millions in donations, and not Atatiana Jefferson's for example? Why is he the face of the movement, and not her?</p>
<p>Because his case is one of the most ambiguous ones.</p>
<p>Floyd was singled out and put on a banner because the whole thing is very questionable and ambiguous, allowing you to swing the situation in any direction. Like right now - any verdict is actually possible. It is also very easy to argue about him. Less ambiguous police victims would get a lot of sincere compassion and a strong verdict against a cop. You can't really riot about it. Compassion for Floyd isn't that sincere (I bet most people who talk about this 'gentle giant' wouldn't be happy to have a neighbour who does drugs and has several criminal records), it is political ('it's the right thing to say'). Compelled speech, obedience, all things they like, and you get a lot more of that if the case is ambiguous.</p>

        <p>Nah, he's being singled out and put on a banner because the video is so bad, and because he died at a time when everyone was already on edge (unemployment was at it's peak and lockdowns were in full swing)</p>
