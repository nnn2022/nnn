    <strong>No New Normal Parenting</strong>
    <p><p>Hi friends, I am looking for folks like myself who are parents trying to navigate this mess. I had a baby in September, and all the baby subs are panicked people complaining about family wanting to see their baby, no one wearing masks, and a bunch of other nonsense. </p>
<p>I created r/NoNewNormalParenting in hopes that I can find some people to relate to, and possibly help other mamas get a grip.</p>
<p>Apologies of this is not allowed, but I can’t be the only one with an infant who is not really worried about Covid.</p></p>

        <p>Me and my wife have 2 boys (3 and just about 2) both were born extremely premature. Our oldest weighed 3 lbs at birt(30 weeks 4 days), spent 7 weeks in NICU before we could take him home. Even with extra precautions during 2nd pregnancy(meds, etc) wifes water partially broke at 27 weeks, she was put on bed rest in hospital for 5 weeks, and our youngest was born at 32 weeks(4 lbs 3 oz)  and he spent 5 weeks in NICU before coming home. Both are in great health now, but needless to say, we were pretty cautious about exposure to people upon bringing them home as both came home in heart of RSV season in bitter north dakota winters and both were high risk. That being said, I have absolutely no concern about either of them getting Rona, or being able to easily fight it off in the event they did. We became experts at ensuring good personal hygiene, as you have to ensure that you aren't bringing any disease into a NICU, not only for our childs sake, but for everyone in that rooms sake. It was not something we took lightly. The biggest fear i have about covid in regards to my boys is they aren't getting to experience things little boys should because everything is closed and everybody is afraid. No new normal for us, we are so over this bullshit. But just taking it one day at a time</p>

        <p>This is a beautiful response. Ngl, I was bracing for impact, but I am so glad you have a proactive mindset. </p>
<p>I absolutely agree about our kids losing out on experiences. Hopefully, this whole thing is creating a generation who won’t take things for granted? Maybe?</p>

        <p>Thanks. I can't help but worry that this culture we live in forces the youth to take things for granted. Love things and use people. Maybe im just cynical as I've come to accept that is the way i was when i was little. All we can do is try to raise critical thinkers who know nothing is guaranteed in this life. Hope you and your little one are taking this all in stride, kids are so resilient, don't really have to worry about them in that regards. Stay healthy, and try to stay positive!!</p>

        <p>I have an almost ten year old who only liked school for the social aspects. He's one of those glass half full kinda kids, so he's doing well with this ass backwards, changes every day/week virtual learning shit. Boys and Girls club was giving us somewhere to take him during the day, but they just shut as well. So now all three of us (ex and his new wife) had to adjust our work schedules to keep him on task for virtual learning. </p>
<p>I am so fucking OVER IT</p>

        <p>I just joined! I have 4 kids, 8, 6, 4 and 2. And we are so done with all the "new normal" garbage. They just want to visit their cousins and grandparents and friends and have a normal Christmas! Glad there's other like minded people in the world. </p>
<p>Also my son, who is now almost 7, had RSV as a 3 month old. He was in the hospital for 5 days and there were so many little babies there with the same thing. And guess what? The world kept on as normal, there were no shut downs, no news about it, nothing.. And that's the way it should be! All these restrictions over a virus are ridiculous.</p>

        <p>Joined! Hope it doesn’t get banned. I worry all the time about the effect this is having on my 2.5 year old. Will he ever get to go to school someday? Will I be able to keep a mask off him forever? Will he ever have a real birthday party or go to a friends birthday party? Will he ever have a friend outside of his immediate family? It’s hard not to feel hopeless sometimes 😔</p>

        <p>One issue that I am surprised I can’t find more people upset about is the new tendency to only allow one parent at my kid’s doctor appointments. Is this policy really slowing the spread? I have a job that allows me to take time to attend these appointments and help momma out in getting baby everywhere we need (2 months old). But lately I have gotten the hand to the face when trying to go into the appointment. So really I just end up being a taxi driver. </p>
<p>I know I know...
-pick a new physician. 
-we all have to make sacrifices.
-does she really need you there at the appointment?
-the nurses are just doing their job.</p>
<p>Which is why I usually just turn around and walk out without any fuss and go patiently wait in the car until mom comes walking back out. Then we just drive home and I have to rely on just getting moms recall of what doctor said about baby’s health. </p>
<p>Is this really the thing that is flattening the curve? Because there are a metric butt ton of people in Wal-Mart and Target. </p>
<p>I can’t really explain why it makes me irritated but it does. I want to be as present as possible in my kid’s healthcare but I can’t be if dad I just told, “go sit in the car and wait.”</p>
<p>Feminists, before you even comment, we know that moms do all of the tough work and are amazing but is it possible to comprehend that there are loving dad’s out there as well?</p>
