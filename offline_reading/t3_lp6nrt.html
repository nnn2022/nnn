    <strong>Why are Covid vaccines certifications going to be needed? I’ve had harder times with the flu</strong>
    <p><p>I remember my entire life, every time I had the flu (I’ve had it about 4 times and I’m 29) </p>
<p>I never get the vaccine and nobody bats an eye.</p>
<p>Every time I have the flu I am knocked on my ass and I feel like I’m dying every time.</p>
<p>I remember being very young , around 10, not being able to even walk from how bad the flu was.</p>
<p>I had the flu last year and my temp was borderline going to the hospital and all the doctor told me to do was take fever reducing pills and if that didn’t work, go to the hospital.</p>
<p>The flu is is crazy virus and I don’t want it again. It’s the worst thing to happen to you as a regular person.</p>
<p>I know Covid hurts people too and it makes you nervous , but you can say that with anything in life. </p>
<p>It just blows my mind that people are considering having a Covid vaccination certificate along a passport and stuff.</p>
<p>Why isn’t the flu vaccine a certification? </p>
<p>The flu is worse</p></p>

        <p>I read an article from the WHO posted in this sub pretty recently about how they disagree with vaccine passports. The whole point being that its contradictory, someone who has had the vaccine can still contract the virus and still spread the virus. If that's the case, what's the difference between someone who has had the vaccine and hasn't had the vaccine. I've brought this up to people who are all for the passport and immediately try to dismiss it.</p>
<p>Why are people so eager to blindly follow what's in the media and completely ignore other sources of information. Its not even a fringe source with dubious accuracy. It's the WHO! The same organisation they are so quick to quote when they see some new news article. Infuriating</p>

        <p>In 2017 my daughter had the flu, ended up in the ICU with tracheitis. The school didn't shut down, I didn't have to wear a mask to visit, she wasn't treated like a leper.</p>

        <p>It probably will be. I can see them adding a vaccine section to the wallet apps on iphones and android phones. It will likely be called vaccine library or something fun. It will be colorful and bright and can be scanned with QR codes and communicate with NFC devices at entrances of schools, shops, and offices.</p>
<p>You'll have all your vaccines listed there and will be able to show them off to all your friends as as sign of your superior status in society. You won't be able to function in society without 100% of your vaccines. No work, no food, no living.</p>
<p>Every time you try to go to the grocery store and walk in, the alarms at the door will go off (from the NFC in modern phones) and the door person looks at their tablet and says "it looks like you're missing your covid-19 and the flu vaccines, so you can't enter until you get those."</p>
<p>You can get delivery they'll say, but eventually you'll be ineligible for delivery, "you're putting the driver at risk, Anti-Vaxxer!".</p>
<p>Eventually you either take it and renter society and deal with the potential effects or you live as an outcast and remain unaltered and as you currently are.</p>
<p>On the bright side, they'll be so many outcasts that they might end up forming their own (a hopefully sane) society.</p>
