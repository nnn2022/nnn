<li>
<p>People can massage numbers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The way the study was conducted could be lopsided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The main point, hypothetically if the CDC were to say that Covid kills 40% (or any significant number) of people who catch it and you know a bunch of people who caught it and haven't died then it's wrong. If it kills 40% of people that catch it and 20 of your friends have caught it and none of them die, or like 1-2 of them die and others echo the same thing in large numbers there's a reason for it. Sorry but we take tons of things off of testimony, again, for a reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Statistics can also conflict with other statistics. For instance the abysmally low flu death statistics for this year. It points to what other people have been pointing out, that non-covid releated deaths are being attributed to covid.</p>

        <p>Warning, seeing reality from an objective point of veiw and refusing to accept the official Pravda that is the inversion of that reality DOES make you a thought criminal! Not to mention a racist, bigot, selfish, and potentially a spreader of "misinformation" , particularly if that misinformation is the unapproved truth. </p>
<p>Not in keeping with being a "new Soviet man"
 Errrr- "new progressive person"</p>
