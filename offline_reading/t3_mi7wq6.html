        <p>I like you're title. I would NEVER want to have children in today's day and age. Not because I don't desire them, but rather I don't want them to suffer. 10 years from now, the world will look a lot different and we are on the verge of being effed, well we already are. I'm saving My imaginary kids from all the suffer.</p>
<p>You're kids will be brainwashed by the leftists even more, and will be required to take all these random vaccines, and you will have no freedom with your own kids. The government will dictate everything on how to "raise" them by their narrative. And I dont want that. My imaginary kids will thank Me on the Day of Judgement.</p>
