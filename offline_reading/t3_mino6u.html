    <strong>This whole situation made me realize I really need new friends</strong>
    <p><p>I could imagine others on here can relate but before March 2020 I had several solid friends who I would see a lot.. and now it’s April 2021, and some of them still don’t want to see me in person... not even if they get a vaccine! Like what?! Prior to the pandemic I agreed with them on almost everything and we related very well .. but now they seem to blindly follow all the fear mongering and I think it’s about time to find new people who have common sense. I can show them literal CDC numbers that show we shouldn’t be sacrificing anything just like we didn’t for the flu.. and they just don’t get it. They get mad at me thinking i’m  a republican and therefore being “anti-human rights”.. I’m actually pretty socially liberal... I just have common sense with covid. Sorry this was long.. just wanted to see if anyone else feels the same way.</p></p>

        <p>It’s a shame that public health has become so politicized that you can lose friends just by wanting to hang out with them in person. Wanting friendships and human interaction is not political, it’s a basically human need and is just as important to your health and washing your hands, brushing your teeth, and taking your vitamins etc</p>

        <p>Lost a ton of friends just before the pandemic due to my views on all aspects of reality, the global elite, government authoritarianism, stolen history, 9 11, jfk, the moon  and moon landings etc.</p>
<p>Then along came covid. I still don't speak to them, but at least I now know that I was closer than they were to being right about some of what we lost our friendship over.</p>
