    <strong>What do you think of ''Long COVID''?</strong>
    <p><p>Saw this piece of propoganda pop up https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8818861/Long-Covid-sufferers-claim-symptoms-WORSE-ill.html#comments</p>
<p>They really seem to be ramping it up lately.</p>
<p>It seems to be convincing a lot of the readers there, who usually lean on the lockdown skeptic, no new normal side. I'm wondering what you think. Does the flu cause the same rate of ''long term'' effects?</p></p>

        <p>Any virus can lead to post viral illness, and they do.</p>
<p>It happened to me, and totally disabled me as a child though I'm much more functional now but still have a chronic illness. </p>
<p>Covid isn't unique. There's no reason it would cause higher rates of post viral issues. Some of these people will be suffering post viral syndromes but some will of course be suffering psychological issues due to the current climate. Its still a minority who have ongoing issues. </p>
<p>The difference is that the media cares about covid because it's a money maker, so they're pushing these "long covid" stories as if they're the majority and is if it's anything new - it's just the usual post viral syndrome and CFS in a small minority. It suits the media to present it as new and scary and a super common outcome. The media has never cared about those suffering chronic illness following viral infections before... and they don't care now. Trying to make this a new thing "long covid" does a disservice to those suffering now, and those living with post viral illness. There's actually plenty of research and in recent years there's been some breakthroughs, but making it "long covid" doesn't give these people access to that information and what we know about management. It also denies the importance of funding further research to further the ongoing research if it focuses on making "long covid" it's own condition, seperate from what is already an identified condition.</p>

        <p>Some people think that history started when they were born.  Everything that happens to them has never happened before, and thus they are unique.  People have delt with crap throughout history.  Just because they have to deal with new crap, doesn't make them special.</p>

        <p>I think a lot of the long haulers look like the people who complain of chronic fatigue syndrome, especially the ones who actually never got a positive test. There way too many ailments that are supposed to be linked to it.</p>

        <p>Also I think many of them are being impacted by lockdown itself. If all you ever do is stay home and play video games, your energy level will go down.</p>
