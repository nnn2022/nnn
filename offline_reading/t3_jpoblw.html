    <strong>Just remember…</strong>
    <p><p>Trump winning will not make a difference. You’re watching a reality show. It’s all scripted. They want civil war, chaos and America to fall. Trump is playing his role. They want you to be angry about Biden. They want you distracted.</p></p>

        <p>I tend to agree with this but it's not as black and white as you make it out to be. Before the election I had determined that I wasn't going to vote, because of this kind of line of thinking. Also,  because of this line of thinking, I typically don't pay attention to all the bullshit in politics. However I started paying attention, I watched the "debates" if you can call them that and actually looked into things Trump has actually done.</p>
<p>Trump has actually done a lot of good for this country. In the face of constant opposition and adversity he has actually accomplished a ton in just for years while CONSTANTLY being attacked. You know the mark of a good government? One you barely notice in your life because they don't interfere. </p>
<p>**In the last four years, we have seen gas prices go down because Trump got us out of ridiculous and expensive climate accords and green energy deals. That will change if Biden/Harris become President. Gas and energy prices WILL go up significantly.</p>
<p>**We have more money in our pockets because Trump actually cut taxes AND removed the individual mandate, even though unfortunately he wasn't able to fully repeal Obamacare because our Republican leadership fucked us all over. If Biden wins you can't count on taxes going up and there's a good bet that we'll see the return of an individual mandate. </p>
<p>**In the last four years, Trump has made unprecedented progress in foreign relations,  DESPITE what the media will tell you. The only people Trump has really pissed off are people involved and related to United Nations and anyone who is trying to force the US to live by THEIR rules. 
     -In the middle east, we have seen an unprecedented level of cooperation between middle eastern countries and particularly with Isreal. Trump has NOT started any new wars in the last four years and has actually brought troops home. Trump actually has a diplomatic relationship with world leaders like Vladimir Putin and even North Korea's Kim Jung-Un which is a good thing, not a bad thing. We need to be able to talk to these countries even if we're not "friends". Trump has actually stood up to China and spoke out against them.</p>
<p>**continuing from the last point, Trump has actually STOOD UP to the globalists. How many politicians, especially PRESIDENTS,  have you seen do that? </p>
<p>My last point is the biggest one. Trump has actually took a stand against the globalists. He has consistently taken the stand that he is AMERICA first, NOT the world. If nothing else, this election is essentially America vs Globalists. If Trump loses, if Biden Harris wins, that is a victory for the globalists. And that is exactly what a vote for Trump is. It is a vote AGAINST the globalist system. </p>
<p>TLDR -- Even if Trump is just a puppet player in this system, that is the role that he represents. Trump represents the anti-globalist. This is important, we do have a choice, even if that choice is nothing more than telling the globalist elites NO, we DO NOT choose you.</p>

        <p>I feel this and almost voted because of this. But ended up not because I ultimately decided he is still just a puppet. He's playing the role of a savior which panders to some but at the end of the day he still pushes for things that relate to the NWO like vaccines. There's a national agenda and then theres the global agenda and no matter who is president, the global agenda will be obviously weaved throughout.</p>

        <p>I don't blame you man. I almost didn't vote because I more or less believe the same thing. I actually agree with you and I've noticed all the inconsistencies, pushing vaccines and big pharma and all that crap. But I also noticed the things that I mentioned in my original comment. I guess to me, the reason I voted is because "A" I wanted to voice my opposition to the globalists, because even if Trump is just a puppet, he's playing the role of the antiglobalist. You wanna talk about a puppet, old Joe doesn't even know where he is. He's the definition of a puppet if there ever was one and he supports everything the globalists want to do.</p>
<p>I also voted for Trump because if Joe wins that will result in an immediate negative impact on my life AND others. Things will get much more expensive, much more quickly and small businesses will continue to be crippled.</p>

        <p>First of all, every US president and politician worships Israel. Which is a bad thing as we give them THREE BILLION+ in tax payer money every year. Maybe you’re evangelical or some Christian sect who believes that in order to bring about the end times Israel must be successful. All I see is the criminality of that apartheid state in the murders it commits on the indigenous peoples of the region, and the massive amount of tax payer money used to fund exactly that. The Middle East isn’t remarkably more peaceful due to Trump, it’s just as bad as it’s always been, all he’s done is made some Arab governments who already worshipped Israel, more publicly worship Israel. US occupation of Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria continues, once again massive landfills of tax payer money. Whatever Islamist terror bogeyman they come up with isn’t a serious threat to us, they , as in the government is the threat and boogeymans such as Covid, drugs or terrorism are used to take away our freedoms. </p>
<p>“I think Trump is a better feces sandwich than Obama”. He’s still a feces sandwich and you’re debating over feces sandwiches. The only reason I would want Trump to win is for petty satisfaction at getting mainstream liberals enraged, but aside from that it’s all a dog and pony show. Just a circus, theater for the masses to fight over while government continues to clamp down on whatever liberties remain.</p>

        <p>Well I can tell you I ain't no Zionist. I agree with a lot of what you say, but I also don't make pretend like I know everything, I don't. I know how things will happen in accordance with the bible but there's still a lot I'm ignorant about. There was a time when I was pretty arrogant about what I thought I knew. Thankfully since then I've been humbled. Thankfully God hasn't left me blind, but there's still a lot more I don't know than what I do know. What I do know is that these globalists aren't the ones in control. They will succeed or fail according to God's will, not their own. I only pray that more can be saved before the end.</p>

        <p>We're on the same side. I think it's good to remember that we're on the same side even if we don't think exactly the same way. In fact it's better we don't think exactly the same way, we need that. The globalists want EVERYONE to think and act the same way. We're not robots, we're human beings, with differences that should be celebrated, not demonized.</p>

        <p>I see where you're coming from and you have valid points but I'm of the opinion that if Trump was such a thorn in the globalists side they would have taken him out. One just has to look at the panama papers and the assasination of Caruana Galizia to see what happens when real threats to the elites appear.</p>
<p>Trump is no doubt the most hated American president to ever exist. It would have be very easy for the globablists to take him out and blame it on someone from the radicalized left with Trump derangement syndrome. People would even celebrate that he has been assassinated, that is how much division he has created since getting in office.</p>
<p>I'm of the opinion Trump is playing his role perfectly. Since he has been in office, the division in America has reached ridiculous heights. Now we have a situation where Trump loses an election due to fraud. The division has now gone to a new hieght. If Trump takes it to the surpreme courts and gets back in office that way, civil war will happen.</p>
<p>The globalists need a civil war in America to bring the country down. The whole show is playing out just how they wanted.</p>

        <p>I actually completely agree with you. I think that's a completely rational train of thought and even a very plausible scenario. My point is though,  no matter how sure something may seem, we don't know the future. We can speculate all fmday long, but we don't know. </p>
<p>I take solace in the fact that Jesus Christ is in control, regardless what happens. So I'm not concerned. All I do is the best I can. But these people, these globalists, no matter how powerful they are they are not gods and they are not infallible. They make mistakes and they make them often. Those of us that God has given eyes to see, those of us that are able to see the game that's being played behind the curtain, these globalists WANT us to believe that they have complete and total control and that there is not hope. </p>

        <p>I genuinely thought Trump was against the globalists but as time goes on I see that his role has been to create the division in America to create a perfect storm for a civil war. To bring down America, it has to be done within. Divide and conquer is the only way.</p>
<p>Since he came in office, the division is off the charts. Married couples divorcing over their politcal beliefs. Family members not talking to each other because one voted for Trump. You now have a lot of dedicated people on the right for Trump and you have a lot of people on the left who despise him. </p>
<p>Now America has an election where no matter who sits in office, they will be seen as illegitimate. The right will see Biden as a fraud and if Trump get's in office through the supreme courts, the left will go ape shit stating he manipulated and bribed his way back into office. Either way, a major part of the population in America will lose faith in the poltical system completely. That is the key.</p>
<p>I hope I'm wrong about Trump, but I have to see things for what they are, and all I see is nation edging more and more towards civil war and Trump has been a major player in creating that division.</p>
<p>I will say one thing, I don't think the globalists will win and get what they want. I believe they have underestimated the human spirit.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately I think you're exactly right. This election will create the perfect storm. In terms of dividing the country, Trump has made it very easy for people to dislike him because of how he conducts himself. On the flip side, Trump has hardly had to do anything as all of the media and social media have been against him since the beginning, which understandably gives his supporters the impression they've made the correct decision when all the world is against him. As for the people who are most easily influenced by the message the media has been putting out, they've been frothing at the mouth since the day Trump entered office. For people who know the media is a sham, the media validates their support of Trump. For people who actually follow the media and listen to it, media validates their hatred of Trump.</p>
<p>You're wrong about the globalists though. And the human spirit. They will win. It's an inevitable eventuality. It's already been foretold. Things are unfolding just as The Bible said they would in the end times. We are in those days. These wicked men will receive the prize they've so diligently pursued. But their victory will be short. God's judgement will rain down on then and they will be utterly destroyed. </p>
<p>As long as humanity is under the curse of sin,we will never see a utopia here. That is the reason why the worst travesties in history of been committed in pursuit of utopia. The hearts of men are evil. Only God can convert the heart and open the eyes. </p>

        <p>He's the most hated man people lost critical thinking and spend their days on social media's. They control people's perception. Trump did more good to the US than Obama in 8 years. The globalist don't need a civil war to achieve their plan (great reset), all they need to do, is destroy the economy like Canada's Trudeau PM is doing, inflation, increase national debt, UBI and immigration which are things that Biden will 100% do.</p>

        <p>No doubt. It's bad. People don't pay attention. It's the old boiling frog analogy. The water continues to get hotter, government invades our lives little by little, but people shrug it off as just a "small inconvenience". It happens slowly enough most people think it's "no big deal" and not worth putting up a fight. Plus divide and conquer is so effective most people are to busy fighting left vs right they don't notice that both sides are robbing them blind.</p>

        <p>Lol well, I can't say I was doing that at 5, but by the time I was in high school I was already questioning everything. But I was raised as a Christian conservative and taught to think for myself. I realized really young that our school system was lying to us.</p>

        <p>It really hit me how fucked up the school system was when I began to fail assignments because I answered correctly. When we had group assignments, and my group answered incorrectly, I would answer correctly. The teachers would acknowledge that I answered correctly, but I'd still fail the assignment because I disagreed with my group.</p>

        <p>That's perfectly understandable, thank you for answering that much. At first I suspected you were older, mostly because it seemed you have values that most people consider "outdated". But when you mentioned your experience in school I figured there was a good chance you were around my age. It's good to know someone my age with similar values. I'm 27. </p>
<p>To the best of my knowledge I don't think I ever experienced something like that when I was in school, but I went to a small school in rural Nebraska. I grew up in a place with conservative values. </p>
<p>One of the things that allowed my mind to open up was when I was going to Sunday school I had a pastor who taught me about young earth creation. Because of that I learned to question school at a young age. I knew that if evolution was wrong then any number of things I learned at school could be wrong. I've also always been a spiritual child, I've always been drawn by spiritual matters so I learned to think more about God's will for my life than my own personal desires. By God's grace, through life's struggles my eyes have been opened to many things and I'm very grateful. I'm so grateful to God... I couldn't imagine going through life not seeing the things that I do. Even if it's difficult at times,  I would never go back. </p>
<p>And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.  For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.
Ecclesiastes 1:17‭-‬18 KJV</p>
<p>Even so..</p>
<p>How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver!
Proverbs 16:16 KJV</p>

        <p>Yeah haha, people online tend to assume I'm much older than I actually am. They also tend to assume I'm a man. Then they think I'm 10 to 15 in person, and my husband gets a lot of weird looks for being with a girl so "young" even though I'm the older one. Kinda funny lol</p>
<p>I've always been rather spiritual too, aside from an "atheist" phase in middle school that lasted maybe a few months. Now I'm not sure there's really such a thing as truly atheist. Religiosity is inherent in human nature, and we'll always seek God in something.</p>

        <p>Haha well to me from our first interaction I just thought you seemed like a sweet, older woman. I was kind've thinking 30s or 40s. Someone still young, but you just come off as someone with more maturity than someone in their 20s. You seem like someone I would have enjoyed knowing.</p>
<p>That's interesting you went through an atheist phase, that's something I've never particularly experienced. I have wandered outside of the Christian path, but I've never actually doubted God. In searching for authenticity in my faith, I prayed and told God I didn't want to be a Christian just because that's what I was raised to be. I want to be a Christian, or whatever else, because it's the TRUTH. I want to know and follow the truth. And for awhile I stumbled away. I've done a lot of reading and research and exploring. I was a big pothead for awhile, got really into hallucinogens for awhile (that was stupid) I totally departed from Christianity for a time, before God gracefully brought me back. It gave me a lot of interesting perspective on the world though and I'm thankful to God for allowing me to have those experiences. The Lord has been exceedingly and abundantly  gracious and full of mercy toward this often rebellious sinner. I have played the prodigal son and God has welcomed me back with open arms.</p>

        <p>That's why I put "atheist" in quotes because I wasn't <em>really</em> atheist. That's just what I called myself at the time, trying to be "edgy" or some shit, but I was really just questioning and exploring my spirituality. I wouldn't entirely consider myself a Christian - or rather, many Christians might not consider me one of their own - but Christianity influences my beliefs perhaps more than almost any other religion. As my grandma would say, "I'm not a Christian, I believe in God and Jesus."</p>

        <p>Never, ever did I say Trump is my saviour. Do not put words in my mouth. I have one savior and that's Jesus Christ. I know eventually the globalists will win. But I also know that these people operate by a certain "code" of sorts. They often have to tell people, in some way, what they're doing. We also often get some type of "choice". In this situation, there IS an antiglobalist choice, even if he is just a puppet. </p>
<p>Furthermore, it would seem that you believe the globalists have complete and total control of everything. That's a lie. That is one of the ways these people have hijacked conspirator's minds. They want you to believe they have everything planned out and have control of everything. They don't. They fuck up ALL the time, because they are not God. They are not infallible. They are imperfect, human little men trying to play God. They are not in control, God is.</p>

        <p>I'm aware. I've known that for a long time. I'd convinced myself quite some time ago I would never vote again. And yet, against my better judgement I still went out and voted. I know both sides are controlled but... I still went and chose the people that I feel won't raise my taxes, won't raise gas and energy costs, and won't raise inflation (as much) via out of control government spending. I also voted AGAINST Biden as he was the clear globalist pick, plus people, plus dementia... I mean at least Trump can form his own sentences. Plus the fact team Biden is promoting masks and lockdowns do hard.</p>

        <p>It's a freakshow and we have front row seats. Once you know how the game is played, you can kind of predict what will happen. I said to my relatives that this election won't go smooth and a lot of fuckery will go on to create more division and distraction.</p>
<p>It would not surprise me if Biden wins, then Trump takes it to the surpreme court and Trump gets in office. Can you imagine what would happen? A lot of cities burning and a very possible civil war.</p>

        <p>I am nowadays a little torn on this.</p>
<p>On the one hand NWO always plays both sides and has all eventualities covered.</p>
<p>On the other hand, with Brexit for example, they did try to stop it at all costs, including assassinating an MP in a false flag attack, but people still voted to get out.</p>

        <p>Sorry, but every empire falls eventually. Maybe we need it. Not to make way for a global authoritarian collectivist technocracy, but to regroup into smaller communities of shared interest that actually give a fuck about each other. The states haven't been united in some time, if they ever really were, and this COVID situation only goes to show that a nation of millions can't live happily ever after under one government. I only wish we could agree to disagree a bit more peacefully.</p>

        <p>I used to think like you but Trump is not controlled opposition. He doesn't listen to anyone and there's a reason why media's have been destroying his name for the past 4 years even if he achieved more things than Obama. Don't get me wrong, he's no savior but he went against the Globalist sns that's why they're taking him down. As for Covid, he's the only leader who downplayed this virus which fuells the covid skepticism within his supporters which is a good thing considering that it's not what media's are portraying it to be. So between a globalist who's goal is to push Agenda 2030 and the great reset and Trump... The choice is clear.</p>
