    <strong>Rip Van Winkle</strong>
    <p><p>I'm convinced I went to sleep, maybe for an hour or a day or 100 years and when I awoke, I found there was a whole new race populating the earth. They sort of looked like people if you could see anything besides their eyes, but they talked funny under their muzzle and they didn't seem to know how to think. "What happened?" I asked the Creator. "They were overtaken by Fear," came back the reply. "Fear of what? A virus?!?" Don't they know that viruses are a natural part of life and never kill anyone unless that creature already has one or more underlying conditions that weakened their immune system? I didn't wait for the answer -- I'm too busy packing to leave this madhouse and go to some other place where the inhabitants don't worry about when they're going to die. They just live. Bye.</p></p>
