        <p>The mRNA shots are not effective.    They misrepresented the data to fudge the numbers.   Does it really make sense to you that a rushed product is suddenly 95% effective?</p>
<p>"Covid19" is no worse than a flu for most people under 70 years old.</p>
<p>Side effects are indeed rare.   So is crashing your car, but at least then you are covered by insurance.  If you get a side effect from the mRNA shots, you will pay for the damage yourself.  You cannot sue.  You cannot get a replacement body.</p>
<p>You can review data at VAERS to decide for yourself how 'rare' the side effects are.  https://vaers.hhs.gov/data.html</p>
<p>I am not anti-vax either.   The mRNA shots are NOT vaccines.   They changed the definition of 'vaccine' in January to accomodate these shots.  </p>
<p>The mRNA shots are not designed to prevent disease.  They are there to make boatloads of cash for the pharma companies.</p>

        <p>Feel free to take it, but</p>
<p>&rt;Covid 19 is a horrible disease </p>
<p>this is just wrong. Covid is a highly contagious but mild respiratory virus. A 0.2% IFR respiratory virus is really not that dangerous or deadly at all. In fact, that is a mild and relatively harmless virus. Hundreds of millions will get it (WHO estimates 750 million people have already gotten it) but the vast majority either have no symptoms or very mild. Only the most frail who don't have much longer to live get severe cases (those with pre-existing and serious end-stage conditions), barring the very few outliers where there's an infinitesimal chance that a healthy young person might develop a cytokine storm and die.  That's exactly how the common flu works every year, in fact the flu has a higher chance of killing healthy young people and children than covid.</p>
<p>&rt;with lasting impacts</p>
<p>I know the media is acting like lasting impacts are common and exclusive to covid but...literally every viral disease in the world, including the flu, common cold, and gastroenteritis, can result in long term effects. Whether that be postviral lactase deficiency, chronic fatigue syndrome, myocarditis, pericarditis, scarring, or whatever. </p>
<p>We accept those complications as potential risks for every single viral infection (including other coronaviruses).</p>
<p>So why are those same complications are suddenly unnacceptable for COVID19?</p>

        <p>I wouldn’t get it simply for the reason that because this is considered an experimental vaccine you would not receive life insurance in the case you would die also you can’t sue if anything goes wrong. I had Covid while autoimmune comprised right at the start of the pandemic and I’m completely fine. I’d rather have covid 100 more times than take something that received emergency approval.</p>

        <p>Last I heard, Covid has a less than 1% death rate, and 94% of the people who did die from it also had underlying conditions. On the other hand, the "vaccine" isn't even a vaccine, it's an mRNA shot. They changed the definition of vaccine a few months ago so they could call it that. It was rushed and untested, and the companies making have been freed from any liability. And on top of all that, we don't even know how effective it is anyway. Besides, most people probably are going to take it which will lead to greater heard immunity, meaning you can freeload off of those who take it and receive most of the benefit of taking without taking it yourself.</p>
<p>Comparing the benefits to risks, I see no reason to take it.</p>

        <p>Depends on your age and risk factors.  I'm fit and 26 years old with no conditions, I had Covid already.  For me it was just the sniffles.  It legit felt like allergies, aside from one day in the middle where it felt like the common cold.  My wife had even milder symptoms-- nothing but loss of taste for a few days.  Not even a runny nose.  My brother had no symptoms at all.</p>
<p>Now I'm immune, and even if I wasn't, Covid wasn't shit.  I actually enjoyed the time off work, I played video games and ordered no-contact delivery pizza.  If I got it again, I'd laugh and plan my vacation and order pizza.</p>
<p>Odds are, I wouldn't be hurt from the vaccine either.  But why risk it?  I already won this gamble.  I got Covid, and fully recovered and it was no big deal.</p>
<p>Why roll the dice again when I won the first round?  Even if the vaccine is safe, even of there's only a small chance that I'd have a stroke or go infertile?</p>
<p>If you're young and fit, Covid is almost certainly not going to hurt you, so there's no point to gamble on a vaccine.  Your odds are probably better with the virus.</p>
<p>If you're old and/or overweight, in one of the risk groups for Covid, then maybe the vaccines start making sense.</p>
