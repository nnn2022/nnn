    <strong>Sick and Tired of Having Arguments With Sheep</strong>
    <p><p>I'm visiting my friend for his Birthday from back home and my Mom was complaining about bringing Corona home. I literally said "We could've been exposed to it during our trip to California in January. I have a higher chance of getting into a car accident than getting Corona" and she was like "You sound like our President." I hate when she says this, it's like a copout. I was telling her that the lockdowns caused more destruction than the actual virus. How this is a test, and the government is testing us how far we will give up our freedoms for "security". Like how they tested us with 9/11. I also argued with her that getting sick is natural, we shouldn't destroy our lives with a virus with a high survival rate. She was like "Well do YOU want to get the cold?" No, but is it the end of the world? She was like "WhAT AbOUt ThE FaMIlies ThAt ArE BeInG WiPEd oUT?!" (She got this story on the news, and the news will take sensationalist stories to prove a point and I told her this.) I said why do you care about Corona all of a sudden? You didn't care when you went to Atlantic City with your fwb/boyfriend/whatever? She blamed cases on my generation, even though my generation is scared shitless for no goddamn reason other than virtue signaling and propaganda. </p>
<p>I honestly told her that Corona was a test to see how far they can push shit. Billy Gates said the next virus will be scarier years ago. I can honestly see them openly back peddling, and thus people not giving a shit about the next virus. Things will go back to normal soon (At least for another ten years.) And she rolled her eyes, I could feel it. I'm tired of giving a heads up to the sheep who suddenly think the government cares about them. They treat me like a conspiracy theorist, like they aren't the ones wearing ~~tin foil hats~~  masks around. </p>
<p>If you ever want a heads up about what "the people" in charge have in store for us pay attention to the memes, tv, and movies. Like how last year there was anti-vaxx memes blaming anti-vaxx Moms, to prepare us to take that shot.</p></p>

        <p>People aren’t seeing logic. I can’t talk to a single person in my house about this. They are all on some other wavelength. It’s like mass Stockholm syndrome. Some other part of their brain is in charge. I can forgive my kids but my husband I just don’t understand. I’ve shown him the data in a very clear way (https://thefatemperor.com/viral-issue-crucial-update-sept-8th-the-science-logic-and-data-explained/) and he didn’t trust the guy in the video. SMH</p>
<p>I do have a few friends IRL that will rant with me or at least, hang out and talk about other stuff. I thinking might leave my church. It’s my main social circle and I feel so incredibly let down. Yesterday the admin sent out an email about the snow plow contract for the winter being curtailed because we won’t be using the building. I think they won’t have services until May. It’s absolutely insane. This is a denomination that prides itself on freedom of thought.</p>

        <p>I honestly don’t care if you stop fucking with me because of one opinion of mine you don’t like. You weren’t my friend in the first place. My childhood friend is a Republican who voted for Trump and I would NEVER stop being her friend because of that. Honestly, she’s a breath of fresh air nowadays compared to my scared liberal friends. I think the more diverse your friends are the better.</p>

        <p>I’ll never, ever tell anyone to endanger their safety or their income ... but outside of situations where your
Job/physical safety are at risk, if you opt for compliance without so much as a protest, you in fact support the new normal.</p>

        <p>I’m sympathetic, let me state that up front. Here’s my concern with this mentality-you say you “tell her” and then get upset when she disputes. The things you’re telling tho, such as how it’s a set-up for government dystopia, those are not necessarily fact, they’re YOUR inferences. Too often our position of No New Normal will get discounted because, while it’s not easy to dispute the data that led to your inference, it IS easy to dispute the conclusions if they smack of conspiracy-oriented dogma. Therefore you lose your audience, stick to the facts about lockdowns doing more damage and the obstacles to acquiring true data. Let people draw their own conclusions; no matter how much your conclusion makes sense to you, it took time for you to arrive at it. Flooding someone with HOW they’re supposed to think instead of just providing data and letting them digest it is the key, IMO.</p>

        <p>I did that first and she still wasn’t interested. There’s no point of pointing out data to sheep. They still act afraid like it’s March 13, 2020.</p>

        <p>Ok, I would rather be a sheep that's healthy then a lion slowly dying from an easily avoidably disease. You know who else was a lion? Trump. The Titans. The Patriots.  They are all very scary lions. They also all got covid. WEAR A F**KING MASK!!!!</p>
