        <p>That's the definition of propaganda and corruption. As a Canadian, I'm genuinely scared of what the future will look like if Biden aka the deep state right hand is elected.</p>

        <p>Alex Berenson has been following the suppression of the Danish mask study. He is quoted here: https://www.foxnews.com/media/alex-berenson-covid-mask-wearing-scientists-censored</p>
<p>Excerpt:</p>
<p>&rt; "That study was finished in June. It was supposed to be published in August," he said. "It has disappeared. There has been no publication of the results. </p>
<p>&rt; "I don't know what the study says, but I think it's reasonable to speculate that if the study showed that masks work, every scientific journal in the world would want to print it. </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>He also wrote the following tweet on October 18 (cited in the submission article):
https://twitter.com/AlexBerenson/status/1317875526997102594</p>
<p>&rt; A lead investigator on the Danish mask study - the ONLY (as far as I know) randomized trial to see if masks protect from #COVID - was asked when it would be published.</p>
<p>&rt; His answer: “as soon as a journal is brave enough.”</p>
<p>&rt; If you think that means the study shows masks work...</p>
<p>In the same twitter thread, Alex Berenson also says:</p>
<p>&rt; I have confirmed the authenticity of the email with him directly. I asked about an unreviewed preprint since it’s been delayed so long, but he says not everyone on the team agrees that makes sense.
&rt; "This is part of a much bigger problem," Berenson went on. "The problem is that science and scientists who are outside what the public health authorities and the media want are being almost systematically shut down."</p>
