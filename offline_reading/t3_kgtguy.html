    <strong>Reminder of the Canadian document</strong>
    <p><p>I saved this when it first appeared. Since the UK is entering the third lockdown as planned, I thought I would share this as a reminder. 
Although the UK isn't in the third lockdown just yet. The tier 4 that has been imposed in London recently, is whats going to come either in the new year or just before across the whole of the UK. The whole of England at least. </p>
<p>Dear REMOVED,</p>
<p>I want to provide you some very important information. I’m a committee member within the Liberal Party of Canada. I sit within several committee groups but the information I am providing is originating from the Strategic Planning Committee (which is steered by the PMO).</p>
<p>I need to start off by saying that I’m not happy doing this but I have to.</p>
<p>As a Canadian and more importantly as a parent who wants a better future not only for my children but for other children as well. The other reason I am doing this is because roughly 30% of the committee members are not pleased with the direction this will take Canada, but our opinions have been ignored and they plan on moving forward toward their goals. They have also made it very clear that nothing will stop the planned outcomes.</p>
<p>The road map and aim was set out by the PMO and is as follows:</p>
<p>Phase in secondary lock down restrictions on a rolling basis, starting with major metropolitan areas first and expanding outward. Expected by November 2020.</p>
<p>Rush the acquisition of (or construction of) isolation facilities across every province and territory. Expected by December 2020.</p>
<p>Daily new cases of COVID-19 will surge beyond capacity of testing, including increases in COVID related deaths following the same growth curves. Expected by end of November 2020.</p>
<p>Complete and total secondary lock down (much stricter than the first and second rolling phase restrictions). Expected by end of December 2020 – early January 2021.</p>
<p>Reform and expansion of the unemployment program to be transitioned into the universal basic income program. Expected by Q1 2021.</p>
<p>Projected COVID-19 mutation and/or co-infection with secondary virus (referred to as COVID-21) leading to a third wave with much higher mortality rate and higher rate of infection. Expected by February 2021.</p>
<p>Daily new cases of COVID-21 hospitalizations and COVID-19 and COVID-21 related deaths will exceed medical care facilities capacity. Expected Q1 – Q2 2021.</p>
<p>Enhanced lock down restrictions (referred to as Third Lock Down) will be implemented. Full travel restrictions will be imposed (including inter-province and inter-city). Expected Q2 2021.</p>
<p>Transitioning of individuals into the universal basic income program. Expected mid Q2 2021.</p>
<p>Projected supply chain break downs, inventory shortages, large economic instability. Expected late Q2 2021.</p>
<p>Deployment of military personnel into major metropolitan areas as well as all major roadways to establish travel checkpoints. Restrict travel and movement. Provide logistical support to the area. Expected by Q3 2021.</p>
<p>Along with that provided road map the Strategic Planning Committee was asked to design an effective way of transitioning Canadians to meet a unprecedented economic endeavor. One that would change the face of Canada and forever alter the lives of Canadians.</p>
<p>What we were told was that in order to offset what was essentially an economic collapse on a international scale, that the federal government was going to offer Canadians a total debt relief. This is how it works: the federal government will offer to eliminate all personal debts (mortgages, loans, credit cards, etc) which all funding will be provided to Canada by the IMF under what will become known as the World Debt Reset program. In exchange for acceptance of this total debt forgiveness the individual would forfeit ownership of any and all property and assets forever. The individual would also have to agree to partake in the COVID-19 and COVID-21 vaccination schedule, which would provide the individual with unrestricted travel and unrestricted living even under a full lock down (through the use of photo identification referred to as Canada’s HealthPass) .</p>
<p>Committee members asked who would become the owner of the forfeited property and assets in that scenario and what would happen to lenders or financial institutions, we were simply told “the World Debt Reset program will handle all of the details”.</p>
<p>Several committee members also questioned what would happen to individuals if they refused to participate in the World Debt Reset program, or the HealthPass, or the vaccination schedule, and the answer we got was very troubling. Essentially we were told it was our duty to make sure we came up with a plan to ensure that would never happen. We were told it was in the individuals best interest to participate.</p>
<p>When several committee members pushed relentlessly to get an answer we were told that those who refused would first live under the lock down restrictions indefinitely. And that over a short period of time as more Canadians transitioned into the debt forgiveness program, the ones who refused to participate would be deemed a public safety risk and would be relocated into isolation facilities. Once in those facilities they would be given two options, participate in the debt forgiveness program and be released, or stay indefinitely in the isolation facility under the classification of a serious public health risk and have all their assets seized.</p>
<p>So as you can imagine after hearing all of this it turned into quite the heated discussion and escalated beyond anything I’ve ever witnessed before.</p>
<p>In the end it was implied by the PMO that the whole agenda will move forward no matter who agrees with it or not.</p>
<p>That it wont just be Canada but in fact all nations will have similar roadmaps and agendas.</p>
<p>That we need to take advantage of the situations before us to promote change on a grander scale for the betterment of everyone.</p>
<p>The members who were opposed and ones who brought up key issues that would arise from such a thing were completely ignored. Our opinions and concerns were ignored. We were simply told to just do it.</p>
<p>All I know is that I don’t like it and I think its going to place Canadians into a dark future.</p>

        <p>I'm really worried now, since it seems that the UK is starting to say new strain which would not likely be named until 2021. And then, it's Covid-21, perfect for their document. </p>
<p>I kept on wondering when I knew that this was a thing and it was this document that gave the first inkling. I thought it was Bill Gates but I was wrong. </p>
<p>And this is getting prophetic, they are putting the plans in place even as most of us truth seekers scream from the mountaintops that this is real. </p>
<p>It's happening right before our eyes and still few people think nothing terrible is happening.</p>

        <p>By the time this "world debt reset program" will be implemented those without debt will be at an absolute minority. My assumption is that those who some managed to keep their wealth, without being part of the elite, will get seized everything they own regardless, and there won't be enough people with you to fight this as most will have lost everything by this point and will be quite ok with you losing everything as well. Also there will be military on the streets, because of le lockdown. At one point military will be at your doorstep, declaring your property has been seized, then you'll be dragged out,vaccinated, chipped and put into a camp.</p>

        <p>Looks like it is written by members of Lyndon Larouche's cult, or one of his imitators, and those guys are obsessed with debt, debt is a key element of their mythology. Predictions sorted by quarters also look very similar to Larouche stuff, he did the same thing in 2008. </p>
<p>You could've always gotten rid of all debt in exchange for all your assets. It's called a personal bankruptcy, and there's no way people would agree to this or take it lightly. Imagine you owe 70k on a house that's worth 700k (which is not unreal if you bought a long time ago), you'd be baffled by such 'debt reset' program.</p>

<p>We're in the stricter lockdowns right now. Can't even visit people outside your immediate household, indoors or outdoors. </p>
<p>Those lockdowns are apparently in response to a "second wave" surge of cases that can't be contained with contact tracing, alongside an increasing number of deaths.</p>

        <p>Here in Quebec positivity rate is 5.7% which means that there is 17.5x times more tests than positive people, or in other words, the surge is far far below the capacity of testing.</p>
<p>Current lockdowns are not stricter. In april it was illegal to fix a flat tire. Even foundation contractors were closed. Dentinsts weren't a thing until mid-june, even if you were in pain(and I was). I literally saw two guys in a park getting a warning for failure to present a gay marriage certificate to the cops in April. Life was 'on pause' back then, now no one pauses anything, they just look for alternate ways to get what they want (which is partly why government freaks out about compliance so much).</p>
<p>Deaths are seriously down since spring too. No one would be scared if there are little deaths.</p>

        <p>Id imagine so. Im also not Canadian and unsure about authenticity of it. </p>
<p>I just find it interesting to see that lockdowns are reoccurring in places as planned, with it also looking like a possibility of a new covid announcement in the near future.</p>

        <p>I agree that it's interesting.  It clearly hasn't worked anywhere, yet here we are.  </p>
<p>I saw the "new strain" headlines everywhere yesterday.  Just in time for the vaccine rollout!  It's their way of making sure this never ends until they get what they want and their plans have been seen through.</p>

        <p>Its cold and flu season. Predicting something is different than planning it. Also this is ridiculous, the federal government in Canada has no control over lockdowns etc. It is all up to the provinces, most of which are not run by the liberal party.</p>
