    <strong>Saw a pretty face today and was overcome.</strong>
    <p><p>Was a pretty lady walking on the other side of the street in the city. I stopped and stared and thought of walking right up to her and talking. Not that this was unthinkable before the world ended, but it felt like another dystopic experience. Like I found another person in the desert. Like when Winston Smith got a note that says i love you. Its maybe been a year since i saw a strangers face. Maybe in the next life..</p></p>

        <p>Yes, though I don't shop at corporate stores like WalMart or Target anyhow, as I gravitate to local markets and country stores. <em>I am surrounded by farmland, so I'm lucky tbh.</em></p>
<p>In March 2020 there was 1 store (Dunkin Doughnuts) that had mask policies and I simply haven't shopped there for a year so IDK if they have changed their policies or not, <em>after getting coffee there every morning for a year</em>  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
<p>I understand it is way different in the city <em>(I work in the city)</em> and the only real way to not wear a mask would probably be to order online, which I hate. For instance some places I used to eat in the city have mask policies so I simply don't shop there anymore.</p>

        <p>It's amazing. There is a sense of community, people grow gardens at home, you can drive to the local farmer and barter for beef (or moonshine haha).</p>
<p>Gunshots are like music and not scary like the city, nobody gets shot here except animals and targets.</p>
<p>Living in the sticks and working in the city <em>(I've also lived in the city for a few years)</em> the main takeaway is people in cities are much more miserable, much more of an asshole, and always in a rush.</p>
<p>The exact reasoning for that is unknown, but I suspect it has to do with having a freedom bubble and just space to breath. <em>There really should be different rules for city and rural living as they are polar opposites.</em></p>

        <p>So true! In January 2020 my friend was looking for a place near me and a decent house on a nice plot of land was around $170,000. He ended up moving on down the road further in the sticks.</p>
<p>Well, in October 2020, another friend of mine was looking for a house on the same road I'm on and the market inflated that SAME HOUSE <em>(there was an issue with the previous tennants)</em> up to $290,000.</p>
<p>Being in construction I see it all the time though, and it's been happening for years. It's pretty common inflating land plots and housing prices because Californian's moving to Virgina like paying 250% market value.</p>

        <p>Ok, so unless the target and walmart go away, your town is not maskless. In fact, it is just a matter of time before your local markets are destroyed by the state. And then u will have to wear a mask or depend on amazon. Im guessing your bank is not local and requires a mask. Eventually, you will have to go in there. u will don a mask!</p>

        <p>I get what you're saying and agree mostly, the entire state is under a mask mandate but nobody follows it.</p>
<p>It's been a year and my predominent source of food are farmers and local markets, in my area these markets/exchanges are not just small businesses but community businesses and there is no way they would be removed. <em>I feel the "authority" in rural areas is much more relaxed, or I possibly hold inflated faith in my community</em></p>
<p>I get how it would be more difficult in a different environment and how you're basically forced to comply to participate in society which is BS. We all on that boat if Vaccine Certificates are mandated, so we all need work together.</p>
<p>Either way, <strong>I will never wear a mask and I will never get the vaccine,</strong> that's for sure. I would die before compromising my principals to follow regulations based on a complete lie. The media entertainers are not scientists, as "tEh sCiEnCe" states Covid is predominently assumptions.</p>

        <p>They will take your bank away in a cashless society if you dont get vaccinated. I guess u could go back to trading. I agree that living rurally is the best way to delay all this. Tnx for the feedback and good luck, we (everyone but the state) are all on the same side at the end of the day.</p>
