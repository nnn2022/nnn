    <strong>Ignorance is bliss-when it's not fatal</strong>
    <p><p>I understood that a good number of people were easily manipulated, but didn't see how big that number was until the past year. No, I don't want a mask, I'm healthy. But some people are so insecure that they'd rather wear masks forever- they like hiding their face. No, I don't want your experimental vaccine- I'm not a guinea pig. How is it that nearly everyone swears they'll never inject drugs like heroin, but if someone wearing a doctor's coat wants to inject you there's no need to look up what's in the syringe? No, I don't give a damn about the inflated numbers. No, I won't just shut up and do as I'm told. No, I won't calm down when this is the world being forced onto children. </p>
<p>Shame on the people who accept all of this. I'm not going down quietly.</p></p>
