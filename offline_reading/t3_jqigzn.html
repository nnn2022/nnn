    <strong>Here's what the NY Times had to say about face masks in January</strong>
    <p><p>So the article I'm quoting from was suggestions for avoiding COVID-19 from the perspective of a reporter who covered SARS. Here's what she had to say:</p>
<p>&rt; 1. Wash your hands frequently.</p>
<p>&rt; 2. Don’t go to the office when you are sick. Don’t send your kids to school or day care when they are ill, either.</p>
<p>&rt; <strong>Notice I didn’t say anything about masks.</strong> Having a mask with you as a precaution makes sense if you are in the midst of an outbreak, as I was when out reporting in the field during those months. But wearing it constantly is another matter. I donned a mask when visiting hospitals where SARS patients had been housed. I wore it in the markets where wild animals that were the suspected source of the outbreak were being butchered, blood droplets flying. I wore it in crowded enclosed spaces that I couldn’t avoid, like airplanes and trains, as I traveled to cities involved in the outbreak, like Guangzhou and Hong Kong. You never know if the guy coughing and sneezing two rows ahead of you is ill or just has an allergy.</p>
<p>&rt; But outdoors, infections don’t spread well through the air. Those photos of <strong>people walking down streets in China wearing masks are dramatic but uninformed.</strong> And remember if a mask has, perchance, intercepted viruses that would have otherwise ended up in your body, then the mask is contaminated. So, in theory, to be protected maybe you should use a new one for each outing.</p>
<p>&rt; The simple masks are better than nothing, but not all that effective, since they don’t seal well. For anyone tempted to go out and buy the gold standard, N95 respirators, note that they are uncomfortable. Breathing is more work. It’s hard to talk to people. On one long flight at the height of the outbreak, on which my few fellow passengers were mostly epidemiologists trying to solve the SARS puzzle, many of us (including me) wore our masks for the first couple of hours on the flight. Then the food and beverage carts came.</p>
<p>Sounds sensible right? Funny how quick things changed.</p>

        <p>What's also interesting is that it doesn't mention anything about "social distancing" either! Also I believe what people aren't keeping in mind is that in China they have very bad pollution and have worn masks as far as I know for a long time!</p>

        <p>It certainly also doesn't mention lockdowns.</p>
