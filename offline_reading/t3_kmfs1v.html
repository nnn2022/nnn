    <strong>Doomers and Stockholm Syndrome</strong>
    <p><p>I've noticed that some of the biggest doomers are the people which are hit hardest by lockdowns (single city people living alone in apartments) and conversely some of the most vocal on our side are hardly impacted at all (rural, married people living in a house with family). I think that this is a sign of Stockholm Syndrome, or in other words, this is a survival strategy where people attempt to placate, rather than challenge or escape, their abusers.</p>
<p>One of the tells for this is when they say "this would all be over if everybody just followed the rules". This is an obviously irrational thing to say both because most people are following the rules and because it is entirely unrealistic to expect that this would ever work given that this hasn't worked in nine months. What this does do, however, is to advocate for the abusers (in this case the government) and to try to get people to, please, just do what the tyrants tell us and maybe they will go away.</p>
<p>The prevalence of this sort of behavior is, I think, caused by our societies instilling a learned helplessness in us in many aspects of our life. Government nannying and big tech censorship teach us that we are not responsible for ourselves. With a lack of formative experiences many of us fail to develop real self assuredness. </p>
<p>Along side virtue signalling and herd-mentality I think that this is one of the three main drivers for the psychology of the doomers. Actual fear of the virus is a distant fourth.</p></p>

        <p>YES I think it ties with the sunk cost fallacy. If you have suffered for 9 months, you need to think it was in good name, that it will eventually help after suffering so much. But if you admit it was for nothing that would be extremely painful... not to mention incredibly embarrassing.</p>

        <p>I was only scared of harming other not the virus itself but I was traumatized about harming others. I felt like a murder all the time for months. When I finally realized I wasn’t, it was very painful. I went back to Texas and in a lot of ways things are better but I am also doing worse because of this pain. Hopefully it will be over soon lol. I remember thinking in the beginning that this was a scam but felt so guilty thinking that. But a lot of people I know won’t question it. I would rather have to deal with this suffering and cognitive dissonance and admit when I was wrong then be where I was in August. Although I always did try my best not to judge anyone for not following the rules. Sometimes I failed though and due to fear became the judgy asshole I promised myself I wouldn’t become. But I didn’t really vocalize it luckily.</p>

        <p>Yeah I def fell for the fear in the beginning, as it's human nature to succumb to hysteria. Then as data started coming out on IFR and rates and the tragic economic toll... the brain takes over, although it helps that I personally already had a distrust of the system/awareness of mass hysteria in the past. There was a bit of unlearning to do of like that knee jerk judgey stuff you mentioned, but luckily I wasn't too deep in it at that point so it wasn't too hard. </p>
<p>Admitting you were wrong after months is very impressive honestly. Most people's egos would not allow that. It's gotta be so hard after months of wasting so much time not living and months of feeling all those toxic things doomers push on each other that go against the human spirit. You give me hope that others can be humble and realize that it's ok to change your mind.</p>

        <p>Exactly. If the government is acting as an abuser according to the typical traits of an abuser then you should also think that Stockholm Syndrome would develop because that's just something that develops sometimes in abusive relationships.</p>

        <p>It's really doubtful that Stockholm Syndrome can develop between institutions and people at this level of intrusion. It's nowhere near total control and powerlessness.</p>

        <p>Why not? People are trapped in a situation where they aren't able to thrive. Their survival may not be threatened but I think many people would no longer see much point in living if they thought that this was going to go on forever. People believe that the same entity inflicting these conditions is also the <em>only</em> entity who can end these conditions. </p>
<p>Honestly, at that point, it honestly sounds perfectly logical for people to try an appeasement strategy. And if Stockholm Syndrome is an adaptive trait which helps people to deal with abusive relationships it therefore makes sense for it to develop in these people. If you believe that it is in your best interest, why just pretend to go along with the government orders when you can instead convince <em>yourself</em> that you want to go along with them so that you can <em>really</em> be convincing in your convictions. </p>
<p>Now when I say that it sounds logical, I don't mean that I agree that its actually a good strategy given the sort of people who are inflicting this on us. What I mean is that its a strategy that does make perfect sense given a few understandable (but wrong in my view) assumptions.</p>

        <p>I think what makes this situation so unique is how difficult it is to escape. With a bad relationship, job there are ways to escape. But with this there were points where it was actually impossible to escape. Even now I would have to travel several states over to have anything close to normal. To me that is what has messed with my mind the most. On one hand I can go anywhere I want but at the same time still trapped in the same prison. As someone who lives alone and relies on group activities for social interaction, it has felt like prison at times. And there is a sense of having no control whatsoever.</p>

        <p>I am 100% anti-lockdown, and although I do have a family and friends still, I am mourning the loss of 2 businesses and a non-profit (all were in the large event sector). But it’s not only that, I just find this entire thing extremely unsettling. I will say that most of the rural cities I have visited this year are most definitely living life as normal though.</p>

        <p>Not everybody responds to abuse in the same way and from what I've read nobody's quite sure why some people develop Stockholm Syndrome and some don't despite similar conditions. One thing that is known though is that a feeling of being trapped or helpless is a prerequisite for Stockholm Syndrome, so the more that you feel that you have options for escape the less likely you would be to develop positive feelings toward your abusers.</p>

        <p>There are different types of doomers but it is unlikely that a significant portion of them has Stockholm Syndrome. 
Thinking they do prescribes too much unwarranted innocence to them.</p>
<p>Not sure if there exist many forms of this syndrome, but as someone who has had it and based on my general understanding of it, this phenomenon includes complete awareness of your moves in and what ways they contribute to your survival. Think of it as a persona you're playing during dissociation that you have to make your captor believe is real.</p>
<p>They are corrupted, yes, mostly through no fault of their own. But that doesn't make them inculpable. They are not helpless poor victims. Their corruption exists to be dealt with by people who are more advanced on those dimensions. That doesn't mean you can your innocence onto them and then think they have somehow been compromised.</p>

        <p>I don't think that their behaviors are malicious in any case (outside of a small minority of 'leaders'). That doesn't mean that what they are doing isn't caused by some character flaw because I think that in every case it is. At minimum, all of these people are poor at assessing information. Even in the case of Stockholm Syndrome, don't mistake my characterization of their victim hood as being my endorsement of some virtue on their part.</p>

        <p>Maybe this is a biased sample on reddit, but most of the doomers seem to think they're rational and scientific and anyone who doesn't go along with dictates and mandates necessarily has to be of lower intelligence and often right-wing.</p>
<p>They have a character flaw objectively, but what if what they are doing and being is the best possible version for them? That would explain why they feel so good and are so arrogant about their delusional superiority.</p>
<p>They are not compatible with goodness, objectivity, reality and survival. That is why I think they cannot prevail long-term. But maybe their worldview is more compatible with our current reality than the truly rational and objective one we go for.</p>

<p>This is a ridiculously insightful comment and a direct rebuttal of a common argument. I agree that learned helplessness triggers this, starting in school. Thank you for your wisdom.</p>

        <p>They want to share the Burden and the Suffering. </p>
<p>They are mad at themselves for for following the rules and seeing others who are not and they are the ones living their lives and having fun.  Those following the rules are not having fun.</p>
<p>Reminds me of little kids at daycare.  They all have to be treated as equally as possible, no special treatment allowed.  Even if the child in question actually requires special attention or something that the other kids are not allowed to have.  </p>
<p>Monkeys are the same way.  Experments done by show that even monkeys can get jealous and rage if they are not treated fairly.  Give one monkey a Grape(YUM) and the other a Cucumber and eventually the one given the Cucumber will break and snap and rage about not getting the grape.  </p>
<p>They have to keep telling themselves what they are doing is the right thing and that everyone else is selfish.  That they are Good and everyone else not doing as they are doing are Bad.</p>
<p>If not then the Cognitive Dissonence will really start getting to them.</p>
<p>They want the grape but are denying themselves the grape because someone else said if you take a grape there will never again be any grapes.  So they get mad that other people get the grapes and they get none.  </p>

<p>And we live in a very Jealous/Envious Society.  Have to keep up with the neighbours.  "So and So had this and that while I don't, Life is so unfair."  People want what others have and are not willing to work hard for them.</p>
<p>To many have had things just given to them by the Government so when some one actually works hard for something and EARN it themselves people get jealous.  Like how so many people say being a Landlord isn't a real job.</p>

        <p>Please use the correct term: Hypochondria Fascism.</p>
<p>Sure - Stockholm Syndrome is a side effect of Hypochondria Fascism. But it is the Hypochondria Fascism causing the Stockholm Syndrome, not the other way around.</p>
