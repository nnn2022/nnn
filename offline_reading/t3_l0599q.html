    <strong>Bringing my newborn baby out in public is an act of rebellion now.</strong>
    <p><p>Everywhere I go people stop me (my baby is super cute though).  I receive good and bad comments regarding the pandemic. I've never received so much attention before, and I'm not saying I like it. I do not. </p>
<p>However, I believe my baby (about 3 weeks) should be out in public sometimes, and he can also develop his immune system in the process.</p>
<p>So, bringing him out in public is an act of rebellion now. It is actually really weird and creepy, but I'm not going to have my baby trapped in a house with no exposure to the real world.</p>
<p>Whenever people stop me,  I have a speech prepared : )</p>
<p>People truly expect that I never bring my baby anywhere...ever??</p></p>

        <p>Doomer parents confining their babies and toddlers inside and slathering them, and everything around them, with sanitizer is going to create a generation with massive health issues like allergies, asthma, and constant illnesses due to weak immune systems.</p>
<p>Not to mention mental health issues.</p>
<p>When I was a lad, my mum was shocked if I didn't come home each day looking like Pigpen from "Charlie Brown". Amazingly enough, my friends and I were rarely ever sick. It's not a coincidence.</p>
<p>You are doing the right thing - ignore the paranoids and hypochondriacs!</p>

        <p>Your baby will be just fine and probably better off that you are smart enough to allow him/her outside. I breastfeed all my boys and took them everywhere. Made sure they got some sun and fresh air. Shoot my first kid was born in Belgium and at a month old walking(strolling) around Paris with his dad, my mom and I. </p>
<p>That was so long ago now, but even then I always had a few people comment that my baby was too young to be out. </p>
<p>My boys have never been seriously ill and never had chronic earaches and strep like a lot of my friends and family‚Äôs kids.</p>

        <p>We would get lots of looks when our family would go on walks last summer, smiling with our bare faces. It was a great summer weather-wise. A lot were friendly and it felt like our child was a reminder of life going on. Still, some would glare or make comments as they passed that, while you can't make it out, sounded judgmental. For some people, it's like they forgot how to live and they can't handle you enjoying yourself while they're msierable with their own self-imposed suffering.</p>

        <p>I was taking my kids out within days. On the way home with a 3 day old I stopped at the store because I needed something.
My mom stopped to grocery shop about 24 hours after giving birth.
I was hosting Thanksgiving around a week after having #2. </p>
<p>That's just how we do things in my family. You have a baby and just get on with it as normal ... And mine were both born during flu season ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è we know how to wash our hands and not have tons of strangers put their hands all over the new kids face.</p>
<p>I know a woman who gave birth last year whose baby recently turned 1 year old... He has been to <em>two</em> places in his life (private households). How fucking sad and unhealthy is that both physically and socially/emotionally ? The kid sees only the exact same like 6 people, ever, and hears nothing but talk of dangerous world, dangerous virus, and only sees the faces of his immediate family. It's sad.</p>
