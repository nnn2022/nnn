    <strong>I lost a friend to covid... (rant)</strong>
    <p><p>He committed suicide due to all of the ridiculousness going on. It pisses me off when I say I lost a friend a couple days ago in conversation and people reply, “oh my god! was it covid?” he didn’t have covid but i bet you anything it was lockdown related and probably written off as covid on the death certificate too.</p>
<p>i’m going to online school right now and one of my teachers is so PC. a fellow student mentioned she was excited because basketball practice was allowed to start back up. the teacher was appalled! she kept saying, “is that safe? are you worried?! are they really allowing that?!” the poor girl said she was just happy to be playing ball again even though they had to be 12 feet apart and wear masks. she said sometimes she has to go away from people and pull down her mask so she can breathe.... and the teacher goes “at least you’re being careful” </p>
<p>CLOWN WORLD!</p>
<p>EDIT: I thank you all for your compassion and understanding. This sub has become my home because it’s the only place people make sense to me. To those calling me a republican or a COVID denier, neither of these things are true. I’m progressive. You sound ignorant for making assumptions. If someone has half a brain and the ability to question what their government is telling them they are automatically labeled as a “republican” or “trump supporter” or “right wing extremist” or “anti-vaxxer” or “anti-masker” or “covid-denier” GUESS WHAT BOYS? this isn’t political! this is bio terrorism. human rights have been infringed on. all of this is wrong. we need to look at the whole picture and stop dividing ourselves more - that’s what they want. </p>
<p>it also really boils my blood how many trolls come on here because they have nothing better to do. if you are so passionate about saving lives then why are the things you say so HATEFUL?</p></p>

        <p>Don't bring your political nonsense into this, we're talking about people's lives. A positive test does not imply that sars-cov-2 is the main causative agent of the respiratory infection. In fact, the main driver of its severity is the bacteria and fungi that resides in your lungs and are opportunistic (meaning the probability of infection rises with the amount and severity of your comorbidities). Suddenly these became irrelevant?</p>

        <p>You do realize that opportunistic bacteria attacking lungs that are already infected with a disease still fall under COVID, right? This isn't a new thing. If you catch pneumonia because of the flu and die, it's a death from the complications of the flu. So if you have an opportunistic bacteria because of COVID, it's a death from the complications of COVID. It's pretty simple.</p>

        <p>But then there's not much difference between this and the flu, isn't it? If ultimately what kills them is the synergetics of the variables then you need to look at the whole equation and not only one variable.</p>
<p>Edit: and you ignore the comorbidities, it's mainly opportunistic because of them.</p>

        <p>Not what I said. Of course two respiratory illnesses are going to have similarities, like opportunistic pneumonia, but COVID affects a lot more than just the lungs and is otherwise not comparable to the flu. I've had both in the last year. We don't know how many complications people are going to have from COVID all over their bodies.</p>
<p>Also, I didn't ignore comorbidities because that's also a factor in every disease ever.</p>

        <p>You didn't really refute me. It's less common with the flu and we don't know the extent of COVID and what it affects longterm. This also doesn't make the flu comparable to COVID as they're objectively caused by different viruses and cause different symptoms overall.</p>

        <p>Oh the flu has killed much more, there are A LOT of epidemiologic records. You're the one ignoring a whole world of factors. Never did we have such a large population (so never did we have so many old people, your proportions need to be readjusted), never did we have so many comorbidities like this, never did we lockdown like this; this surely doesn't count as confounding factors at all 🙄</p>

        <p>You have a special kind of mental deficit, it must be. If it's not sars-cov-2, it's a rhinovirus, RSV, some other bacteria, who knows. The thing is, these deaths were not preventable and the measures taken into place actually worsened the problem manyfold.</p>

Suicides, poverty, missed scans and treatments, dementia and isolation in the elderly...and many of the people that lockdown has killed had on average many more years left than those who died of covid.

        <p>nobody actually needs to quarantine period. When the virus spreads, it doesn't even matter. Just go ahead and put yourself at risk of potential sickness like every human has literally been doing all throughout the rest of human history. Just because your TV set shows you some experts, telling you how to behave, doesn't mean it's suddenly logical to act counter to all sense and live a dramatic pussy's lifestyle 100% of the time. I know it's extremely difficult to act contrary to the conduct of your peers, because you're extremely weak and dependent on your conformity to them, but I'm sure you can manage to do it if you really try. Good luck</p>

        <p>Bluuu, you are not alone.  I'm sorry to hear life is not easy right now.  I hope you're able to be good to yourself and do things that being you joy. I recently started writing down 3 (easy/doable) goals in the morning and in the evenings I write what was great about the day and what could have been better.  This helps me start the day with a few goals in mind and a positive outlook, but then end the day reflecting on the good and articulating anything not so good.  I hope you find somethings that will help you cope.  We will get through this.  There are a lot of good things that can help.  Sending you love 💘</p>

        <p>It’s okay. I am 24 years old and just survived cancer a year ago. While I was undergoing 6 months of chemo I had an actually depressed immune system. I wore a mask at work (before anyone else did), on a plane, and was told even a common cold could find me in the ER since chemo kills your immune system. Nowadays I’m told I can’t get the vaccine since I’m not “old enough” meaning 65+ even despite my health history. Covid is rampant in my FL city. But I don’t care I guess? But it is still  stressful considering the dampened economy from this nonsense.</p>

        <p>horrible clown world indeed.</p>
<p>and you are perfectly correct saying, that suicides,  that are hugely caused by criminal traitor government measures enforced by terrorists in uniforms, are counted as "covid-19 deaths":</p>

<p>lots of them and your friend potentially included did NOT die due to any virus, but got murdered through traitor governments.</p>
<p>use direct honest language.</p>
<p>you are not dealing with politicians making some wrong decisions.</p>
<p>you are dealing with traitor murderers and terrorists in uniform.</p>
<p>also sorry for losing your friend. i hope his chosen death was quick and with little to no suffering :/</p>

        <p>That's how you raise children. Teach them that normal social behaviour is bad and dangerous and normalise anti-social distancing and face hiding behind a muzzle. That's not going to result in a bad shit generation of anti-social degenerates. No normal child will ever become anti-social just because they're raised to fear normal human social behaviour.</p>
<p>That teacher is definitely a moron and a bad influence on children. This fear mongering is not good. Children need to be social, not cowardly.</p>

        <p>The way you’re using it to make it a right vs left thing. I’m not going to waste my time talking to you if you’re going to make a bad faith argument. </p>
<p>I hate shutting down the economy, but I think it’s better than the economic effects of losing a million vs half a million. </p>
<p>Also, the economy isn’t really shut down. You can do just about anything everywhere in a mask these days. Nobody seems to be enforcing any mandates. Would you be surprised to learn that as a liberal I’m very happy about that? I don’t want people punished, I just want them to understand how crazy it is to go out in a pandemic and act like it’s not happening. </p>
<p>My wife’s brother and father both committed suicide. We’ve all contemplated it. So don’t ever boil it down to just some stupid COVID restrictions. We all know it’s way more complicated than just that.</p>

        <p>Not once did I speak about left vs right. I'm talking about people's lives, and with all the studies and medical knowledge I've gathered over the years I can't, in good conscience, abide for this. Sedentarism, obesity, smoking, lack of vitamin D, alcoholism, depression and stress, that leads to a myriad of mental,  vascular, immunological and musculoskeletal diseases, completely ignored over confounding and publication bias and the irrational hyperfocus on one variable. The economy also ties up a lot with the levels of social unrest. Just watch.</p>

<p>But do you live in California? Because it seems like literally everywhere else, especially East where I live just makes people wear a mask. Were those not problems before COVID that are just amplified now that people are paying attention?</p>

        <p>Reread the OP. </p>
<p>They didn't say anything about being Republican or that covid is a hoax.</p>
<p>I think you've been blinded by your emotions and aren't reacting to the actual topic, but to assumptions you've made.</p>
<p>Sadly, it's led you to mock someone who lost a friend to suicide. </p>
<p>You've also indirectly mocked the person who committed suicide.</p>
<p>I'd rethink that original comment if I were you. Though the mods will take care of it eventually.</p>

<p>I'm sorry for your losses and your grief. But that does not give you carte blanche to be a raging asshole to others.
Somebody else doing it also doesn't make it okay for you to do it.</p>
<p>Seriously just walk away from this one. You're not going to win, you're not going to feel better, and you're going to wake up one day and be appalled at how you acted here. There are no good outcomes for you here.</p>

        <p>are you fucking serious? i thought the point of the restrictions were to SAVE lives - not to complain or devalue ONE life just because you lost four people. A death is a death. This whole situation is awful. The virus is awful! I’m genuinely sorry you lost 4 people to COVID - i’ve lost people to the virus too. that doesn’t mean my friends death due to the lockdown and restrictions is any less tragic.</p>

<p>It looks to be geniune article, not a parody, albeit I only skimmed past it. Problem with these articles are when they're blatant, they get removed, when they're not, idiots only read 'Covid' and their brains turn off and don't read the rest.</p>
<p>&rt; The builder was declared dead at the scene, but an autopsy later  revealed that COVID-19 had indirectly caused the accident because  effects of the illness were disorienting, the journal notes. </p>
<p>Lmao</p>
<p>The sheer fact I found this in less than a minute on google gives me hope however, there's a alot of "dirt" still uncensored/undeleted one can dig up if they were simply willing to. I mean you yourself could search for your inquiry, not just ask for evidence on Reddit. Reddit is one of the worse places to get evidence on anything tbf</p>

        <p>It's not just one my dude. I mean ffs local hospitals get more money under the table to write deaths as covid-related by the government. Ofcourse this is just typical balkan corruption, but something tells me similiar practices exist in america and the west.</p>
<p>Bloating the numbers is a mass practice one way or another, it certainly isn't just "1 strange case". The question is just how much bloated they are - you ask conspiracists, they'd tell you its all of them aka a hoax, if you ask others, well, finding objective information and proving it is obviously extremely hard, as corruption is punishable and that means <strong>exposing corruption</strong> is also punishable. You can't even film in hospitals, for example, only pre-approved journalists can.</p>

<p>He says it's rare but that's a lie, considering things <a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/50012971/cdc-report-found-94-of-covid-19-deaths-included-comorbid-factors-heres-what-that-means">like this</a> show almost all deaths are either something else or at least they would've most likely survived if their comorbidity didn't exist.</p>

        <p>That is very much how it works - both the people who I know who supposedly were COVID deaths were highly suspect. One was in hospital in the end stages of terminal cancer. The other died at home of a heart attack several weeks after recovering and was in terrible health - if he had died of a heart attack any other year people would have been shocked but its not like no one saw it coming given his poor health. Everyone was telling him to go to the doctor and to get his diabetes under control before COVID hysteria took hold.</p>

        <p>These are correct reportings.  If covid pushes you over the edge, even if you were going to die anyway, it is a covid death.  That’s how cause of death has always been recorded in western medicine.  As it should be.  If you were about to die of cancer, and I shoot you in the head, the gun shot should still be recorded as your cause of death (with cancer as an underlying/contributing factor).  If you were just shot and you are bleeding to death, and then you have a heart attack, it is a death with cause of death as heart attack and the gunshot wound</p>

        <p>Covid deaths are recorded as any death within 28 days of a positive test. So it is very much possible, but I think op was just expressing their frustration that this happens, even if it doesn't happen to their friend.</p>

<p>Cases and deaths seem to ignore lockdowns(as seen by the fact New York and California have higher amounts of both compared to Florida. In fact, it seems proportional to the population.)</p>
<p>Over a third of small businesses will not be reopening after the Wuhan madness is over with.</p>
<p>The suicide hotline is at over 1000% normal traffic.</p>
<p>This generation of young people have been declared the least fit in history.</p>

        <p>The onus is on you to prove lockdowns work. Any harsh measures short of full border closure are indistinguishable from moderate or light measures (i.e.: they don't work and cause ridiculous levels of collateral damage). You have plenty of comparison countries/state to see this!</p>

        <p>You're the one supporting sweeping changes to society, placing 100% of people under house arrest, limiting education, killing the economy, removing peoples' human rights and freedoms - don't you think you should have a mountain of evidence to support this, especially since it contradicts all existing medical advice?</p>
