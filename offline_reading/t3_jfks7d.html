    <strong>Some great quotes about censorship and freedom of speech</strong>
    <p><p>"Give me the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties." - John Milton</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers." - United Nations, Universal Declaration of Human Rights</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"Once a government is committed to the principle of silencing the voice of opposition, it has only one way to go, and that is down the path of increasingly repressive measures, until it becomes a source of terror to all its citizens and creates a country where everyone lives in fear." - Harry S. Truman     [Special Message to the Congress on the Internal Security of the United States, August 8, 1950]</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"If freedom of speech is taken away, then dumb and silent we may be led, like sheep to the slaughter." - George Washington</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>“Where they have burned books, they will end in burning human beings.” - Heinrich Heine</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"To view the opposition as dangerous is to misunderstand the basic concepts of democracy. To oppress the opposition is to assault the very foundation of democracy." - Aung San Suu Kyi, Letters from Burma</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>“Free societies...are societies in motion, and with motion comes tension, dissent, friction. Free people strike sparks, and those sparks are the best evidence of freedom's existence.” - Salman Rushdie</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"The fact is that censorship always defeats its own purpose, for it creates, in the end, the kind of society that is incapable of exercising real discretion. In the long run it will create a generation incapable of appreciating the difference between independence of thought and subservience." - Henry Steele Commager</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>“Censorship reflects society’s lack of confidence in itself. It is a hallmark of an authoritarian regime.” - Potter Stewart</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>“Laws alone can not secure freedom of expression; in order that every man present his views without penalty there must be a spirit of tolerance in the entire population.” - Albert Einstein</p></p>

        <p>Here is one I always liked, not really about freedom of speech but very fitting right now. </p>
