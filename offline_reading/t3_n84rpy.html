    <strong>I'm losing contact with extended family, and it makes me sad</strong>
    <p><p>I post news articles from the top five world news agencies, information from the CDC and WHO. I'm just posting facts, coming from the people we are supposed to trust about all of this that contradicts what the sheeple were told to believe at the beginning. Trust the science, right? Nope, keep sheeping and cut anyone not sheeping out of your life. It sucks man.</p></p>

        <p>Ah, I know that feeling.  The sheeping is increasing.  They basically decided thinking at all is a skill you only gain when you become a doctor.  Sadly, nothing really softens the sting of being cut out from people.  Hopefully some of them will choose bonds over obedience.</p>

        <p>This has definitely been a learning curve for a lotta us and has made us face some harsh truths about our close connections whom we held in high estimation. </p>
<p>Call me a drifter, but I’ve adapted over the years to the hidden comfort in forming my own familial circle wherever I’ve been. The tradition of the nuclear family is beyond fucked now so the best thing to do is search for and look out for our own. </p>
<p>The likeminded folks deserving of your attention and love will find their way to you. You stick to your convictions as a beacon of sanity and I promise you people will flock to you and the sadness you’re experiencing now will subside. </p>
<p>My recent interactions have proven that you don’t even need to reference any powers that be or any bingo card conspiracy terminology for people to immediately assume you’re slipping into dangerous crackpot talk. All it takes now is to simply strike up a discussion of logistics in current affairs for them to treat you like you’re unwell. </p>
<p>There’s no basis for their “concern”. It’s only disingenuousness masked under a thicket of venom.</p>
<p>It’s a cliche, but it’s the quality of a relationship with an individual that outweighs the quantity of acquaintances with many. Don’t lose sight of anyone you feel deep down you can rely on and trust. Even if they don’t share your views but still respect you that’s more than enough! It’s as it should be!</p>
<p>Everything’s been streamlined, the scientism is indecipherable and no alternatives are acceptable even if it’s patented by their worshipped establishment.</p>
<p>There’s not much that can heal the wounds of the present, but I’m always free for a chat if you wanna drop me message at all! :)</p>
