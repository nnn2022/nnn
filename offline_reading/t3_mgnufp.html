    <strong>Words &amp; Definitions</strong>
    <p><p>I know a few extremely hesitant people, and the other day some of us were all chatting and one of them said it’s not a vaccine. It doesn’t make you immune, etc.</p>
<p>Then you know, the neighborhood boot locker sends a link to the definition and low and behold, they added mRNA gene ~~therapy~~ alteration.</p>
<p>I was in utter shock. Does anyone know when this took place? Do they have prior definitions? It’s the downside of not having physical books.</p>
<p>It reminded me when the powers that be updated the definition of sexual preference in real time during the Barrett confirmations (I don’t care your position on the matter), or recently the WHO altering herd immunity.</p>
<p>It’s such dystopian dream. This person shared this link as if mRNA has been around for 29 years and the others in the group just came out of a bomb shelter.</p></p>

        <p>^copied ^from ^a ^few ^days ^ago</p>
<p><strong>Please stop calling this a vaccine, the definition was changed specifically for this synthetic substitute ridden gene therapy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Now:</strong> a substance used to stimulate the production of antibodies and provide immunity against one or several diseases, prepared from the causative agent of a disease, its products, <strong>or a synthetic substitute,</strong> treated to act as an antigen without inducing the disease.</p>
<p><strong>Then:</strong>  a preparation of killed microorganisms, living attenuated organisms, or living fully virulent organisms that is administered to produce or artificially increase immunity to a particular disease</p>
<ul>
<li>My source would be any definition of vaccine where the webpage hasn't been updated since 2020 (you can copy the old definition and put it within "quotes" on Google, then omit -covid and tons of links show up, or an old .pdf)</li>
</ul>
<p>https://www.ashlandchild.org/vaccine-basics/terminology/#</p>

<p>Which is why the vaccine does not prevent infection, claiming it does would be irresponsible as we are still under clinical trial anyhow...</p>

<p>I will hold my ground to the end. I do not mind watching people die for being stupid.</p>
