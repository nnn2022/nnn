        <p>Really 75% upvoted! Are you guys seriously comparing mask mandates to Jewish Badging. Please tell me what group of people are being stigmatized and humiliated because they are required to wear a mask. </p>
<p>Are you being oppressed by those who are exempt from wearing masks? Are infants using masks to segregate and control your movements?</p>
<p>You are embarrassing yourselves.</p>

        <p>Sure, I'll do. It restricts me from doing my job in a normal way. It restricts me from going to stores in a normal way. Soon it will restrict me from going outside in a normal way. Wearing a mask is not normal. If you want to do so, please.. Be my guest. If you want to wear one, do so. But don't obligate me doing anything I don't want. Especially not when it is for fake safety</p>

        <p>You can do all that the exact same way you would normally, just while wearing a mask. It’s literally just an additional article or clothing you need to wear temporarily, this is like getting angry because you have to put on a coat when you go outside in the winter.</p>

        <p>Why should I wear a mask when it provides no extra safety? Why should I get obligated to something while it has no purpose? Shouldn't I be mad about it because it's temporarily? Temporarily for the next year? Two years? Five years?</p>

<p>A mask is intended to trap droplets that are released when the wearer talks, coughs or sneezes. Asking everyone to wear cloth masks can help reduce the spread of the virus by people who have COVID-19 but don't realize it.</p>
<p>No it may not protect yourself but are you so selfish that you cannot take on such a minor inconvenience to help protect others?</p>

        <p>It's the other way around dumbass. People are being assaulted/humiliated on the street and in public for not wearing one. Any amount of research shows we are facing the same amount of deaths and if they quit wearing masks the hospitals would be empty. The insane fear over Covid is turning people into idiots.</p>

        <p>I agree any assault on a person is wrong including them not wearing a mask.</p>
<p>&rt; Any amount of research shows we are facing the same amount of deaths and if they quit wearing masks the hospitals would be empty.</p>
<p>I would love to see this research, here is a list of research that counter that claim:</p>
<p><a href="https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/danish-face-mask-study-did-not-show-that-masks-were-ineffective-at-reducing-spread-of-covid-19-study-was-underpowered-and-results-were-inconclusive/">Misleading: A study on face masks conducted in Denmark found that masks make no significant difference to the spread of COVID-19 or COVID-19 infection rates</a></p>
<p><a href="https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/wearing-face-masks-helps-reduce-the-spread-of-covid-19-but-it-only-confers-partial-protection-and-should-be-combined-with-additional-public-health-measures/">FALSE: Mask mandates do nothing to stop the spread of COVID-19</a></p>
<p><a href="https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/mask-use-does-not-lead-to-a-higher-risk-of-covid-19-as-viral-social-media-posts-claim/">FALSE: A CDC study published in September 2020 showed that more people wearing masks had COVID-19, therefore masks don’t work or make us more likely to catch COVID-19</a></p>

        <p>Way to find a mask worshipping website. Go to your echo chambers. They claim misleading/inconclusive evidence yet everything they are saying is even more misleading and inconclusive. It's really simple when you look at the actual evidence instead of biased guesses. Masks mandates are applied coronavirus cases go up. There is no counter argument there is no denying actual verifiable facts. The headline even says more masks wearers had Covid 19 and increasing rates. How can you read that and go yup this is working? Are you really that blind to reality or just stupid.</p>

<p>They all list very credible sources. <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817">Annals of Internal Medicine - American College of Physicians</a>, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372">New England Journal of Medicine</a> Where are your sources coming form again?

<p>Again where is this research, would love to have a look.</p>
<p>&rt; The headline even says more masks wearers had Covid 19 and increasing rates. How can you read that and go yup this is working?</p>
<p>Yes and that claim of its not working and making things worse was proven to be false.</p>
<p>&rt; Go to your echo chambers.</p>
<p>HAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAAAHAHAHAHA.... really! You're serious? What do you call this sub?</p>

        <p>The research is look at the graphs per state. Then look at the date the mask mandate was implemented. The new england journal of medicine is the biggest joke of a science I have ever read. Their idea of "clear evidence" isnt even probable. Read the article not the headline. Its called clickbait. If this was done in engineering they would get laughed out of the building. It was not proven false they claimed it was false, proved it to be true then continued saying false I have no idea how these lies are even being published. Well actually I do know, they want masks forever and will push anything through that even hints that they help at all. You have to learn to read past a headline or you'll be a miserable idiot for the rest of your life. You wanna wear your mask like the 80% of covid patients who wear theirs all the time please be my guest. It's better if I don't have to see your face anyways. Just leave people alone. I will be blocking you in about half an hour because you can't listen to reason so don't worry about replying. Happy Thanksgiving I truly hope you open your mind and quit being a selfish child who wants to spread hate and misinformation</p>
