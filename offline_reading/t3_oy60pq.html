        <p>See, I don’t like this. For a variety of reasons but mostly: </p>
<p>If these are the people who were offered the vax first, and they still haven’t all bought in enough that now someone thinks they need to be forced to, that means that there are a lot that do not want it. Not just a few who could just get fired, and no one would feel the absence, but enough that it has to become a mandate.</p>
<p>When this involves healthcare workers, it suggests quite a lot to me about this vaccine and that there are in fact valid reasons for not wanting to take it.</p>
