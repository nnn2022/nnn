    <strong>Something to share</strong>
    <p><p>I did not write this, but this is how I see it!!!!!</p>
<p>I have done my best to respect the diverse opinions regarding COVID-19 over these past few months, however the ER nurse that posted this brilliantly sums up my train of thought :
Please just take politics out of it and read this with an open mind using common sense.ðŸ“·</p>
<p>"Anyone out there who can tell me what our end game is with the covid 19?</p>
<p>What is the magic formula that is going to allow us to sound the all clear?</p>
<p>Is it zero cases?</p>
<p>The only way that will happen is if we just stop testing and stop reporting.</p>
<p>Is it a vaccine?</p>
<p>It took 25 years for a chicken pox vaccine to be developed.
The smallpox inoculation was discovered in 1796 the last known natural case was in 1977.</p>
<p>We have a flu vaccine that is only 40 to 60% effective and less than half of the US population choose to get one, and roughly 20,000 Americans will die of the flu or flu complications.</p>
<p>Oh, you'll mandate it, like other vaccines are mandated in order to attend school, travel to some foreign countries, etc.</p>
<p>We already have a growing number of anti vaxxers refusing proven, tested, well known vaccines that have been administered for decades but arenâ€™t necessarily safe!</p>
<p>Do you really think people will flock to get a fast tracked, quickly tested vaccine, whose long term side effects and overall efficacy are anyone's best guess?</p>
<p>How long are we going to cancel and postpone and reconsider?
You aren't doing in person school until second quarter?</p>
<p>What if October's numbers are the same as August's?</p>
<p>You moved football to spring?</p>
<p>What if next March is worse than this one was?</p>
<p>When do we decide quality of life outweighs the risks?</p>
<p>I understand Covid can be deadly or very dangerous for SOME people, but so are strawberries and so is shellfish.</p>
<p>We take risks multiple times a day without a second thought.
We know driving a car can be dangerous, we don't leave it in the garage. Many speed and don't wear seat belts.</p>
<p>We know the dangers of smoking, drinking and eating fried foods, we do it anyway.</p>
<p>Is hugging Grandma really more dangerous than rush hour on the freeway?</p>
<p>Is going out with friends after work more risky than 4 day old gas station sushi?</p>
<p>Or operating a chainsaw?</p>
<p>When and how did we so quickly lose our free will and give up our liberty?</p>
<p>Is there a waiver somewhere I can sign that says, "I understand the risks, but I choose a life with Hugs and Smiles, and the State Fair and go to Church and go hug my Mom in her retirement home?</p>
<p>I understand that there is a minuscule possibility I could die, but I will most likely end up feeling like crap for a few days.</p>
<p>I understand I could possibly pass it to someone else, if I'm not careful, but I can pass any virus onto someone else.</p>
<p>I'm struggling to see where or how this ends.</p>
<p>We either get busy living or we get busy dying.</p>
<p>When God decides it's your time, you don't get any mulligans, so I guess I would rather spend my time enjoying it and living in the moment and not worrying about what ifs and maybes, and I bet I'm not the only one.</p>
<p>(I copied this from someone else. Feel free to do the same.) but agreed ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯</p></p>

        <p>My cousin is an ICU nurse at a covid hospital. She had a Halloween party last night! Good for her. Essential workers deserve fun, just like the rest of us. They are the ones who see the risk/reward of lockdowns clearly, and all of the HCW I know think that this has gone on far too long. </p>
<p>Cure is worse then the cause.</p>

        <p>Totally agree. Life is full of risks. If your too scared to live your life that is fine, just donâ€™t force your fear on me.</p>
