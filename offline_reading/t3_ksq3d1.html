        <p>Australia's covid strategy has been elmination since  early on in the pandemic. Aussie's have probably all forgotten what "two weeks to slow the spread" was actually for, all they care about is zero covid cases. Can't have a conversation with anyone around me about hospital capacity because they literally don't give a shit.</p>

        <p>The thing is, if that is their strategy, what's their end game? Are they keep locking down until the virus has been completely eliminated globally? The only disease I'm aware of that has been completely eliminated is smallpox, and that was 200 years after the vaccine was first discovered!</p>

        <p>We have been told not to expect to be able to travel to the northern hemisphere until at least 2022 and that the people who want the vaccination should be able to be vaccinated come October. I'm sure the goalposts will change after this, but at this stage it seems that this is life until most of Australia and most of the other first world countries have a largely vaccinated population. Crazy that Aussies are putting up with and actively calling for closed borders for multiple years - we are a multicultural, travel-loving society, and this is especially horrible for the people they are forcing to be seperated from loved ones overseas for multiple years of their lives.</p>

        <p>That is crazy, and honestly really stressing me out. My girlfriend is Australian and I'm British. I wasn't a permanent resident so I had to move back home, and I've not seen her in almost a year now. I don't even care about the lockdown, I'd just do almost anything to be back there, even if it means solitary quarantine for a month. But the Aus government just isn't opening any kind of path to do that.</p>

<p>So sorry to hear about your situation mate! The Australian politicians don't give a shit about anyone or anything except their approval ratings, and unfortunately for us Aussies love lockdowns. Don't mean to stress you out but this is the information we are being fed.</p>

        <p>Thanks for your kind words. It's just been a tough year and I wanted to vent. From my time in Australia, it did seem a lot more authoritarian than any other place I've been. Melbourne seems to be one of the wealthiest and safest cities on Earth, yet the police presence on every corner was like nowhere else.</p>

        <p>Melbourne and Victoria are a particularly egregious police state, unfortunately...</p>
<p>But yeah, Australia has unfortunately taken the very worst of the ‚Äúnanny state‚Äù from the UK and other places, in the last 30/40 years or so, and expanded it over and over again...</p>
<p>It‚Äôs really quite strangling living here, and I grew up with it. üòû</p>
<p>I‚Äôm sorry to hear about you and your girlfriend, mate. A pity she isn‚Äôt allowed to leave, and come see, either!!</p>
<p>Claim you‚Äôre sick, maybe?
It‚Äôs outrageous that we‚Äôre not even allowed to leave our own country, but sadly most Australians don‚Äôt give a shit, so the government knows they can get away with it...</p>

        <p>Not sure what you mean by 'claim I'm sick', but I imagine they'd be far less likely to let me in if I'm sick.</p>
<p>Yeah that's nuts. I thought it was against international law to stop someone from leaving a country (except if they're being arrested).</p>

        <p>What I mean is, (almost) the only way Australians are allowed to leave is on ‚ÄúCompassionate Grounds‚Äù, so quite literally, if you claimed to be sick enough, it‚Äôs possible, but unlikely, that they may let your girlfriend leave the country to come see you...</p>
<p>Quite literally. That‚Äôs one of the only ways she MAY be able to get out, anyway.</p>
<p>So no, they almost definitely wouldn‚Äôt let you in, sick (or anyway, rn), you‚Äôre right, but they might let her out, lol!</p>

        <p>Re laws, unfortunately I don‚Äôt think it is (against international law), see East Germany during the Cold War (or also Hungary during that, or indeed Syria right now...) for example...</p>
<p>However in countries with a constitution, it is/would generally be understood as unconstitutional...</p>
<p>But see, the UK doesn‚Äôt actually have a constitution, and Aus doesn‚Äôt have a Bill of Rights + our constitution is effed in quite a few ways, so... it unfortunately seems to be a bit of a legal grey area, which is what our appallingly authoritarian government is relying on...</p>
<p>So yeah, fucking sucks. But they know they can get away with it.</p>
<p>Was the same with state border closures here. Dubiously unconstitutional, but the state governments could afford better lawyers, so they won the court cases against it/them, lol... üòë</p>

        <p>Lockdown happens because it's effective and keeps people safe. Let me tell you, the government would much prefer it if nobody was in lockdown, since yknow, the economy would stay afloat longer. Take a look at WA and our covid cases due to quick, hard, effective lockdowns. Don't seem too bad now, huh?</p>
<p>The thing here is that when you have the virus, it takes a week for any symptoms to occur. This means that all the people this guy's been around for a full week are at high risk of having the virus. The fact that one case shows itself always means that there are more about to surface. Having a hard lockdown this early is the best way to do it.</p>
<p>Let them go into lockdown, it saves lives.</p>

        <p>It is not safe, or effective.</p>
<p>WHO recommends very highly against it.</p>
<p>Year over year deaths aren't any worse in Sweden with no lockdowns or masks.</p>
<p>Except they won't have more suicides, overdoses, health effects from no exercise, depression. Fuck man, don't you see what this is causing?</p>
<p>There are so many therapies for this, so many vaccines, such advancement in treatment and it disproportionally kills people who are already in critical health and infirm. Why not protect the care homes as best we can without completely destroying society.</p>
<p>If you think we are just going to recover after this you will be in  for a very bad surprise.</p>
<p>There will be more restrictions, more lockdowns, forced vaccines and the precedent set to trigger a 'public health event' or 'tighten up on cases' to keep us in check.</p>
<p>Every single thing we have said so far has come true.</p>
<p>And you keep perpetuating it.</p>

<p>This time will be talked about in history books when the Church of Covid ruled the world.</p>

        <p>I support lockdowns to support my family members in homes, and the wider community, asthmatics, the elderly, those whose lives are in great danger due to this virus. Letting people run free and spread the virus wherever they want just brings the untimely deaths of so many. Surely you don't want to have this reality of the virus arriving and people dying in the thousands. That is the dystopia you are so afraid of.</p>
<p>I've been through a lockdown. It's just 2 weeks, it's not hard. Then you can go back to normal without the fear of being infected with a deadly virus.</p>
<p>As for the WHO thing, I think you're referring to those few people in there speaking against lockdowns, and those professional opinions need to be heard, they are professionals after all. But they are not the majority of professionals. The overwhelming majority of medical professionals will talk of "flattening the curve" so to speak - implementing measures to reduce spread early on.</p>
<p>Also, on the contrary to what you're saying, implementing lockdowns is caring for the critically ill. After 2 short weeks, less spread means less cases, which means hospitals don't overload, meaning those in critical condition for outside reasons can receive the help they need. This is opposed to the months of hospital overflow brought upon by rampant covid spread, creating cases where even stroke victims cannot be permitted into hospitals.</p>
<p>You raise a valid point in that lockdowns do put the mentally unstable at increased harm. And yes, this is a worry, it's something I keep in the back of my mind about this debate. There have been cases in which people under hotel lockdown have threatened suicide and had to be transitioned to psych wards, and that's awful. But that's just the thing. You can't save everyone. Having lockdowns saves so many more lives than the few unfortunate souls who may slip through the cracks. In most cases of severe metal breakdowns, the victim actually ending their life is rare, as they can still be treated and helped and placed in better environments.</p>
<p>Yes, more restrictions, more lockdowns - that's what keeps us safe and alive. Also nobody's forcing you to get vaccinated, if you refuse to take the greatest breakthrough in modern medicine made for your own personal benefit, that's on you.</p>
<p>Not sure what this church of covid talk is though, you kind of lost me on that one. It's not like we want to virus to continue. Just know that it's not going away peacefully unless short term measures are enforced to make it so.</p>
<p>As for Sweden, comparing them with the rest of Scandinavia in terms of covid hospitalisations is very telling. They're not doing as fine as you think.</p>
<p>Think about the greater good.</p>

        <p>Some cities would have to go into longer lockdowns due to having higher infection rates, this is why I'm saying it won't always work, not in cities where the virus has already done its damage. Queensland isn't even looking at 2 weeks. They're looking at 3 days. So you're right in that 2 weeks =/= 3 days. They are looking at an even shorter lockdown period than what I described.</p>

        <p>Are you aware that other countries have already been doing lockdowns for many months? We were told 2 weeks back in March. </p>
<p>I'm confused as to why you're talking about a few days when in reality this has already  been going on for months.</p>

        <p>QLD government has announced 3 days. If they do it properly, it will go in tiny, insignificant waves between months of prosperity and freedom. As soon as a case surfaces, lock up for 3 days, treat the patients, choke out the virus and continue about your daily life. Unfortunately most governments have been too slow, and since their cities have so much spread, have had to implement more extreme, longer lasting lockdowns. I'm opposed to people complaining about governments doing their jobs for once and imposing lockdowns quickly while they still can, like QLD just has. Otherwise the number of cases grows out of control, and the unfortunate choice becomes to either lock up the city or let the virus do its damage and die down.</p>

        <p>Here's a fun fact - my city went into lockdown for 2 weeks, and during that time we had facetime calls with our mates, we engaged in hobbies to keep our mental wellbeing. In fact, homeless people were let into hotels, a warm room and a roof to sleep under, for the first time in years for many. After that there were several weeks of social distancing, when we could at least see each other again, and now, for 6 months now, the city has been covid-free and we live out our daily lives. We don't even need to wear masks. If I see my mate out in the middle of the city I could give him a big old hug if I wanted. Hospitals can treat their patients as normal. It's the world you want back so desperately. Would you trade 2 weeks of your life for everything to go back to normal in the long run? I want you to be able to live your life free. Lockdowns are good for you, and for everyone.
And before you claim I'm brainwashed or whatever, our state had to fight federal government in order to make this a reality. They didn't want lockdowns. But as we're seeing here, they saw us and they've learned. They learned that it works. So they're doing it too.</p>
<p>Side note, car crashes account for 1.35 million deaths every year. Seat belts and airbags were invented to help control this, to bring that number down. COVID-19 cost 1.9 million in one year (significantly more than cars), and most cities did not implement proper lockdown procedures. Imagine how much smaller this number can be next year if we all sacrificed 14 bloody days.
Unfortunately in cities where the virus has already done its damage, a lockdown will have to drag on too long to be effective. In that situation it's a bad idea. The city in question in this post, Brisbane, has but one confirmed case. They have the perfect shot. Therefore, Brisbane should go into lockdown.</p>

        <p>There are two possibilities for exponential growth. Either it goes down to 0, or it goes up until everybody is infected. Those are the options. There is no such thing as "a few cases circling around". That's not how exponential growth works.</p>

        <p>One cleaner at a quarantine hotel in Queensland, Australia (where they have spent the last year bragging about how they have no covid cases) has tested positive to the so-called UK mutant strain. Because of this, the capital city of Brisbane is going into a lockdown for 3 days that involves masks to be worn outside of the house at all times, gyms/churches to close, takeout only from restaurants/cafes, funerals of 20 max - all with less than 12 hours notice. It's only for 3 days at this stage but we'll see if it gets extended or not. Australia is a hellhole.</p>

        <p>I feel terrible for the cleaner. Because they contracted a virus that might not kill them, the entire city is in a tough lockdown again. They should have just quarantined the cleaner for a few weeks and let the rest of their city get on with their business.</p>

        <p>Every international arrival into Australia must quarantine for 14 days at a government run quarantine facility, and they are using hotels to house the arrivals. Not allowed out of your room and you must pay the thousands of dollars to stay there out of your own pocket. Flights into Australia are also capped at max 6,000 people per week, leaving thousands of Aussies unable to get home, even if they could afford to pay for the hotel quarantine.</p>

        <p>Don't forget that their current "mostly no lockdown" is predicated on completely closed borders to the rest of the world, including to over 30,000 Australian citizens who are stranded abroad and aren't being allowed to return <em>to their own country.</em></p>
<p>If I were an Australian, this would be a profound wakeup call -- that in the government's opinion I have no civil rights as long as COVID exists, and what rights I am temporarily allowed are subject to being revoked at any time, on 12 hours' notice, with no legal recourse.</p>

        <p>It was worse here in Victoria. We had some of the most horrible lockdowns over 10 cases. From what i can recall, we were only allowed one hour out of our houses (which could only be used on exercise and shopping), we couldn‚Äôt go further then 5km from our homes, masks were mandatory EVERYWHERE, even outside alone. All states borders were closed, we couldn‚Äôt leave the country, there were police checkpoints everywhere, and to top it all off, lockdown protests were banned. Like, a pregnant woman got arrested in her own home in front of her kids for organising a protest through Facebook. Not going, organising. </p>

        <p>Yes, but see that‚Äôs the problem. It‚Äôs not the cases, it‚Äôs the response.</p>
<p>If it‚Äôs like this over 1 case, in Summer, I‚Äôm sure you can picture what the powers that be will do, and did, when there were a few more...</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not the virus itself that I‚Äôm worried about, or scared of...</p>
<p>Anyway, I‚Äôm sure you meant well, so thanks. But I think this country is far more prone to authoritarianism than you might think, at this point... Sadly. üòï</p>

        <p>The media is in full-blown panic mode, too...</p>
<p>‚ÄúBe scared! Never leave your house! Mutant strain! You WILL be infected!‚Äù</p>
<p>As usual, the media treats us just like an offshoot of the US, much like with the Capitol Hill debacle this week...</p>
<p>We only remember we‚Äôre an island on the other side of the world when it‚Äôs politically convenient, like with the effing Exit Ban...</p>
