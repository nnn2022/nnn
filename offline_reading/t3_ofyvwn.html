    <strong>The way media uses language</strong>
    <p><p>I just had this thought after getting some news alert on my phone about the latest news about covid. Than I thought to myself, "huh remember when everyone was calling it Corona virus" and then I realized: why did we stop? And we didn't stop really. At least not in the sense that we all decided to stop saying Corona virus. Rather, the media stopped calling it Corona virus. </p>
<p>Now why would that be? "Come on", you say "it's just a silly name it means the same thing." And yes you're right it does mean the same thing. But you're also wrong. When you say "Corona virus," it sounds very silly. You will likely immediately go to making beer jokes, maybe you'll call it "Rona" for short, etc. etc. The same can be said about say swine flu, hence why it never terrified the minds of many Americans. And the media is well aware of the language they use. Or at least they have their heads so far up their own ass they think to better serve the people they should use the clinical name of "covid-19." The name covid-19 has a very scientific and alienlike sound to it. Hell if you told me in 2019 that the next alien location Samus was going to explore in a new Metroid game was called "covid 19" I'd probably think that sounded real. </p>
<p>Isn't it sort of amazing how the media was able to do this? Hardly anyone calls it Corona virus because now the virus is "no laughing matter." The true irony is that in the beginning it made much more sense to be scared at least a little bit, where as now if you're still scared you are basically as far as I'm concerned just an idiot or someone who needs to get out more. The media just up and changed something as seemingly innocuous as the name and got away with it. And they are constantly controlling language and they get away with all the time. So pay attention to the media's influence in our language. It is what ultimately shapes the culture we live in.</p></p>

        <p>When people would search the internet for Coronavirus they would discover it was in the same family of viruses that cause the common cold, which conventional wisdom taught us had no cure / vaccine...it was just a fact of life.  Early on they pushed the "novel" angle, but if you know about the human immune system it's designed to handle most novel viruses just fine.</p>
<p>I suppose that wasn't scary enough, so COVID was coined.  I've noticed the -19 has been mostly omitted in the last few months, because rational people would conclude you can't have a permanent worldwide pandemic stretching over 3 years.  </p>
<p>I'm not sure if it's constant, effective propaganda, or willful ignorance, or if most people just don't give a shit anymore.</p>
<p>I'm seeing fewer and fewer die-hard maskers now, even with the media BS about "variants," so I am hoping the MSM will realize they have milked this doomsday cow dry and move on.  When that happens, our idiot politicians will follow suit and figure out the next way to bilk us for trillions.  </p>
