        <p>The comments on that post are so clueless. The vast majority of people are living their lives pretty normally. Kids are in school and playing with their friends. People are socializing, eating out, going to work, etc. Yet they honestly believe that the flu has completely disappeared because of masks and social distancing, even though ALL the scientific data before and during this pandemic concluded that masks do not stop the spread of influenza (though they believe they do stop covid). But now they magically work, virtually eliminating influenza, even though even the biggest mask advocates would never claim masks to be remotely that effective, especially since now they are admitting that only wearing 1 mask isn't good enough. And these are the same people that constantly complain about how no one ever wears masks, and that's why covid cases skyrocketed during the fall. And what do you know, when you look at hospitalization data, miraculously the hospitals are filled exactly how you would would expect them to be during cold and flu season. It couldn't be because of the unprecedented testing crusade that is giving an over-sensitive, lab-confirmed diagnosis to every man, woman and child, who in any other year would have just been diagnosed with a Flu-Like Illness. It is a bit strange that hospitalizations haven't changed in a meaningful way after practically vanquishing one of the most deadly viruses ever to plague mankind. And to think that had people all just worn bandanas in the past when walking through the store, millions of lives could have been saved.</p>

        <p>The people that have locked down the hardest, and are still obsessive about it are not only the ones who will look the stupidest if they are wrong, so they will twist themselves into knots to justify their behavior, but they are also the most sheltered, so they genuinely think everyone is taking it as seriously as they are. Its actually quite sad.</p>

        <p>Read the <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/22272237/flu-cases-down-historic-what-does-it-mean">vox.com article on this </a>. Another naive reporter who has no clue about real America. Still trying to believe we‚Äôre gonna mask up and self quarantine when we might have been exposed to the FLU. The flu.  Not covid.  And they still believe that most companies will be more open to more lenient sick use.  Again. This from someone who can do there job from home 100% of the time. And probably did pre-covid too.</p>

        <p>It's because being socially distant and wearing masks is a good way of controlling the outbreak of a virus It's just that covid is more contagious than the flu but if more people would have taken it seriously we could have been out of this months ago.</p>

        <p>It makes more sense then everything said on this sub like saying that if we were told the truth about covid in its start then maybe we could have handled it better. versus you guys saying it it's all a huge government conspiracy to see how much it can control the average person and every single country in the world is engaging in it but you guys somehow know the truth?</p>

        <p>We mainly fumble because our present was spreading a ton of misinformation about the pandemic while downplaying it the whole time, Which led to some people thinking it wasn't dangerous or that we don't need to take safety precautions, which led to the further spreading of the virus and us not having the right understanding and equipment to combat the virus that's also why it spread.</p>

        <p>Absolutely no one thinks that getting covid is an instant death sentence is just that covid does kill a lot of people, it also can lead to problems that can last for the rest of your life. also getting covid can lead to hospitalizations and since so many people are getting it, hospitals are filling up and don't have enough room for other people which is a huge problem.</p>
