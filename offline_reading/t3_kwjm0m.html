    <strong>LAPD Unlawfully called off protest on Jan 6th at the city hall.</strong>
    <p><p>I attended the protest at the city hall in Los Angeles on January 6th.  When I arrived there were several hundred Trump supporters making some noise, but not engaging in any violence or illegal activities.  Then LAPD announced that the protest was declared unlawful without any further explanation.  The officer told us we had 5 minutes to clear the area or he would start making arrests and use whatever force necessary.  Shortly after a riot squad of around 100 heavily armed officers surrounded us and cleared the crowd.  Moments later another group of rough looking crackheads showed up on the very corner we were told to leave.  This second group then began to fight each other.  LAPD beat up and arrested a few of them.  Later I watched the news story to find out the protest was declared unlawful to to violence.  The footage of the fighting they used as "evidence" was the fighting I mentioned. All acts of violence occurred after the police declared the protest unlawful.  I believe the second group was hired and the police knew they would be there.</p></p>

        <p>This is an old technique as old as time itself. The purpose isn't to arrest those in attendance, it is to deter those who sat at home, the general populace, who might have considered attending the next. But tarring the event with violence would discourage most and kill possible future events, and then the cause.</p>

        <p>Not that I know the specifics of the LA protest, but they told you guys to GTFO because of the situation at the Capitol going on at that time. They didn’t want you guys to be “inspired” and do the same at the LA city hall.</p>
