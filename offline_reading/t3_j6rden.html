        <p>Got any studies that address the reality that masks cause the majority of the population to constantly touch them? And that they don't wash them?</p>
<p>How about a study showing that asymptomatic spread is actually a real, significant source of transmission?</p>

        <p>personal anecdote.... I went golfing with a coworker on Friday. Ate  breakfast together (indoors), played 18 holes, high fived, had beers after (indoors). No masks all day. He woke up the next day and couldn't smell. Went in for a test and tested positive. The rest of us there that day got tested and ALL came back neg. </p>
<p>The guy he shares an office with even came back neg.  The guy with covid has average cold symptoms right now, along with loss of taste / smell. </p>
<p>Hmmm if asymtomatic / presyptomatic spread was a thing wouldn't one of us have caught it?</p>

        <p>Universal mask wearing is important because asymptomatic spread <em>doesn't</em> happen? <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-2671">Because it doesn't.</a></p>
<p>&rt; Our results showed that patients with COVID-19 who had more severe symptoms had a higher transmission capacity, whereas transmission capacity from asymptomatic cases was limited [0.3% secondary attack rate]. This supports the view of the World Health Organization that asymptomatic cases were not the major drivers of the overall epidemic dynamics.</p>

        <p>The motto behind the mask is “slow the spread “ i should use a few ad homs against you but i won’t.  Hey great idea. Let’s throw out a hundred plus years of us and many rct’s knowing these things can’t stop something smaller than the holes in them. Maybe in your little bubble the critical thinkers are the laughing stocks but there is a great quote from Mark Twain about convincing someone they’ve been fooled.</p>

        <p>If you read the science you’d know why the idiotic “omg the virus is smaller than the holes!!!” misinformation campaign has been thoroughly debunked. Seriously, it’s really simple if you just did a simple google search. (Hint: viruses travel on atmospheric nuclei or water droplets, and those get caught by the mask. Viruses don’t actually float around by themselves like you see in cartoons) </p>
<p>Of course I’m using ad hominems, you people are spreading misinformation costing people’s lives and their livelihoods and if everyone was just smart about this pandemic we’d be where countries like Germany are now, recovering from the pandemic and being able to reopen already instead of having more and more families lose their loved ones.</p>

        <p>They are aerosols you dunce. I have multiple RCT(gold standard of "science") showing they do NOTHING! Google will tell you what micron size masks can stop and "covid" isn't one of them. Not to mention the plume that jets out the top and sides of these muzzles. Even if these things did anything at all why the fuck would you criminals want to slow it down. Corona viruses are known to be here and gone in two years. All dictators throughout history have  preyed on sycophants like yourself that bend over and gladly accept everything they have to give</p>

        <p>Have the studies that are all thoroughly sourced and listed on the page been stricken down? If not, why are you smearing the site when it's all sourced? It's no wonder that this site has been heavily smeared as a source of 'misinformation' when it runs against the prevailing narrative that is being pushed from every mainstream source, who of course are all bastions of truth who have never told a single lie.  If I just take all the links to the sources and post them here as evidence against masks like you did with your one single link, neither of which are peer reviewed studies but are actually just opinion puff pieces, would that be better for you? Here you go, I mean I'd rather not copy and paste the entire page into a reddit article just so I can avoid your inability to accurately evaluate a source, but I'll give you a few of them:</p>
<p>https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/</p>
<p>Straight to Oxford universities CEBM, I take it that isn't misinformation or has it been 'fact checked' too and found to be misinformation by some omnipotent body who couldn't possibly have its own biases or conflicts of interests? </p>
<p>https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data</p>
<p>University of Minnsessota a well known source of misinformation as well is it?</p>
<p>https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577</p>
<p>British medical journal, wow, so biased, obviously ignore this one.  Especially since this study says cloth face masks actually increased the rate of infection with ILI-like illnesses in healthcare workers.  </p>
<p>I could carry on, but honestly you are better off clicking and evaluating the links on the page you claim to be misinformation yourself.</p>

        <p>&rt;A recent study published in Health Affairs, for example, compared the COVID-19 growth rate before and after mask mandates in 15 states and the District of Columbia. It found that mask mandates led to a slowdown in daily COVID-19 growth rate, which became more apparent over time. The first five days after a mandate, the daily growth rate slowed by 0.9 percentage-points compared to the five days prior to the mandate; at three weeks, the daily growth rate had slowed by 2 percentage-points.</p>
<p>Study is up for retraction. </p>
<p>&rt;Another study looked at coronavirus deaths across 198 countries and found that those with cultural norms or government policies favoring mask-wearing had lower death rates.</p>
<p>Ignored obesity and ignored South American countries. </p>
<p>&rt;Two compelling case reports also suggest that masks can prevent transmission in high-risk scenarios, said Chin-Hong and Rutherford. In one case, a man flew from China to Toronto and subsequently tested positive for COVID-19. He had a dry cough and wore a mask on the flight, and all 25 people closest to him on the flight tested negative for COVID-19. In another case, in late May, two hair stylists in Missouri had close contact with 140 clients while sick with COVID-19. Everyone wore a mask and none of the clients tested positive.</p>
<p>Anecdotal bullshit that was later disproven in the former, and the latter only half of the clients were tested.</p>

        <p>There are zero legitimate control studies showing the efficacy of cloth masks or any of the other homemade masks that governments have deemed ok. I'm not suggesting they mandate surgical masks either because those also do not prevent the spread of viruses. In fact, all data shows they don't slow the spread of a virus which is why we don't wear masks during flu season either.</p>
