    <strong>Medical exemption</strong>
    <p><p>According to my local health authority, I should not wear a mask as I find it difficult to breathe while wearing it. Unfortunately they fail to provide any advice on how I can prove this fact to police or angry citizens when I’m inevitably asked to mask up. If anyone has successfully been granted a medical exemption, please let me know how you achieved this and what type of reactions you’ve had when asked to present your proof.</p></p>

        <p>Here in the States you’re not required to submit any proof, if a business is going to accept your medical exemption they cannot ask you what your condition is or why you need it. They cannot force you to tell them. Just tell them you are protected under HIPAA and not required to disclose your condition. Unfortunately even then they can deny you entry as ADA considers this a public health threat and does not protect in cases like this. Even some of the states’ mandates have a bit on this, that a business cannot be fined or closed for allowing medical exemptions and are not allowed to ask patrons what their condition is. They are however allowed to deny entry if you can’t wear a mask, even if they do not provide an alternate service as again ADA has left us in the dark.</p>
<p>When it comes to random people when I’m out and about, screw them, they don’t have any place to know what my exemption is. Typically I just state “I am medically exempt” and keep walking. If they harass me further I either say some witty nasty retort or just keep going about my business-nobody is in a place to know your medical conditions unless you want to tell them. Sometimes I’ll say “ok great, I’ll trade you my PTSD for your mask” usually that shuts them up, but I only do it in the right situation. </p>
<p>If you’re not in the states I’m not sure what the rules are surrounding exemptions, but whatever the case, random people when you’re out and about do not have any place to be asking or to be knowing your medical conditions or asking for proof or your exemption. Perhaps store employees do, depending on the rules where you are, but random patrons and citizens certainly do not.</p>

        <p>I do like to point it out because in a few cases I’ve had people say “oh man I didn’t know that was a thing, I’m sorry” and then I’m potentially helping them see that maybe what they’re doing isn’t super great and “educating” them somewhat on the mandate itself. It has happened very few times but still it has. </p>
<p>I also like to because it helps humanize those of us not wearing masks at this time. It’s easy to get online and spout off about “there are no medical exemptions” when you’re not talking to someone specific face to face, but when you are it’s not quite so easy. I’ve had a few people kind of step back and look at me and you can see them dial down their aggression. This is just how I like to deal with it. The more I can make them look me in the eyes and see that I’m someone being majorly affected by all this, the better I feel about it whether or not it changes anything (unlikely).</p>
