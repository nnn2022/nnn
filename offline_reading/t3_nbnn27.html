    <strong>I think I realized why people are hesitant about going back to work.</strong>
    <p><p>I didn't realize how obvious this was; it's not just about getting more in unemployment benefits than you would by working, although that's part of it. I think a major part of it is that people who go back to work might have to get vaccinated in order to back to work, and those people are hesitant to take the vaccine. I wouldn't blame them if they didn't want to be required to get vaccinated in order to resume normal workplace activity.</p></p>

        <p>It's more then just potentially being forced by your workplace to get the jab. Most workplaces had to do renovations and rework the flow of production to account for social distancing and cleaning requirements. Plus wearing a mask for 8-12 hours a day. The jab is just the latest requirement.</p>

        <p>Dafuq you on about, i never stopped working. Hell got two promotions and about 60k a year more money while so many stay home hiding.</p>
<p>OSHA mandate, if a company requires a vaccine they accept responsibility of said employee has severe side effects .. AKA they are liable for workman's comp.... Think corporations are gonna go requiring it with that kind of risk.... </p>
<p>FUCK NO</p>
<p>They're hesitant because they're lazy and wanna game all day. When humans see a free ride they're going to jump on the boat, don't fucking fool yourself.</p>

        <p>I'm still at work and seriously considering quitting if I'm required to get the COVID vax.</p>
<p><strong>Not sure, but just what I'm thinking:</strong></p>
<p>I'd argue that Row V Wade grants me constitutionally protected medical privacy and it is none of their business if I am or am not vaccinated. If they press the issue, I think my first move would be to get a lawyer to write up my argument on their letterhead and make clear that I intend this to be class-action (include all victimized employees). Even if they win the suit and get to fire all xxx of us, that would be very expensive. </p>
<p>Really hope it doesn't come to that and don't think it will.</p>

        <p>My career was stolen from me. I’ve been on UI for about 13 months. I have no plan to return to work until I get a job I’m qualified for and i will not be getting the jab or masking up </p>
<p>Sooo yeah... I’m pretty fucked</p>

If you spent a year of your life doing whatever the hell you wanted, would you go back to the grind?</p>

        <p>I don't totally disagree; I did say that the unemployment benefits is definitely a part of it. I'm just speculating; that's why my flair was Opinion lol.</p>
