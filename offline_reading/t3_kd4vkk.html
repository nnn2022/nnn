    <strong>The New (Old) View of Sickness and Moral Worth</strong>
    <p><p>In the Old Testament in the Bible, it was a commonly held belief that if an individual is sick, it must have been because he was contemptible in God’s eyes. He must have done something wrong. </p>
<p>In short, he must have <em>deserved</em> his poor fortune.</p>
<p>With all the ‘rona hysteria running more rampant than the affliction, there seems to be a condemnation of people who fall ill. As though, the man in question did not obey the lockdown terms hard enough. I just find it so concerning that we seem to be sliding backwards in regards to how we treat our fellow man. Everyone is supposedly a walking cesspit of icky germs that must be avoided at all costs. </p>
<p>It’s just sad, more than anything else.</p>
<p>What do you think of this new/old view of morality and disease?</p></p>

        <p>Really great post, OP.  I hadn't looked at it this way, but I believe you hit the nail on the head here.</p>

        <p>I've seen this from both sides, sadly. On this sub, you have some who throw around memes/comments implying that if an obese person dies from covid, they deserve it for letting themselves get fat. Then in mainstream political/news subs, you see the endless "haha so-and-so who partied or spoke out against lockdowns got covid" posts. As well as the avid predictions that people like us will get horribly sick in the future and thus repent of our sins. And the complete disregard of lockdown-caused ODs/suicides, because whatever, those people were mentally ill anyway.</p>
