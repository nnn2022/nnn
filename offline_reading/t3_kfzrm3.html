    <strong>I Believe The Purpose of Immunity Passports is Peer Pressure and Weaponizing Us Against Each Other</strong>
    <p><p>A friend/ colleague and I have been discussing the Covid-19 vaccine(s) for several months now, and had both agreed we wouldn't be getting them, at least not right away.   Not because we think the vaccine is some demonic mind-control device or anything like that, but simply because it hasn't been probably vetted over time.  In our work we both, on occasion, see first-hand the consequences of medical treatments that were brought to market which were believed to be beneficial at the time, but later turned out to be rather harmful.   Perhaps this vaccine will turn out to be just fine, perhaps it won't, but in the end we had both agreed that since our personal risks from Covid-19 are so tremendously low, it didn't make sense to take a vaccine until further study and surveillance showed it to be adequately safe - not just in the short term, but over some time.</p>
<p>Additionally for my friend, he and his wife are trying to get pregnant and have been having a very hard time.  They're both older and it's a huge uphill battle already, and he felt with it not being studied in pregnancy it wouldn't make sense for him and his wife to get it.</p>
<p>Recently our employer announced that they would NOT be mandating the vaccine.  They are strongly recommending it, but leaving the decision up to individuals.  They are saying they won't even ask for vaccination records (at least not yet).  However, many of our colleagues are very for taking this vaccine, and are being very pushy about it.   And wouldn't you know it, today my friend announced he is going to be taking it.  When I questioned him on it, what it basically comes down to is that he wants to fit in, wants to be part of the group, and doesn't want to have to wear his mask at work any more (jokes on him on that one...)</p>
<p>And after he and I finished talking, it suddenly hit me.  Peer pressure is one of the strongest forces we face as human beings.  And that, I think, is the real reason for immunity passports and vaccine ID cards and the like.  Yes there is some power in stopping a person from living the life they want to live.  But at the end of the day if you can't go to the pub, or can't go to the concert, or can't travel across the ocean, you'll find a way to make do.  However, imagine when your friends all start telling you how disappointed they were that you couldn't go to the concert with them, and how much fun it was.  Imagine when your parents start crying because you can't travel to see them, and beg you to get the shot because you're breaking their hearts.  Imagine a fiancee pleading with you to take the vaccine so you can take her to Italy for the honeymoon that she has been dreaming of since she was a little girl.  This is what immunity passports and vaccine ID cards are all about.  They facilitate peer pressure.  They weaponize us against each other.</p></p>

        <p>I agree completely. One of the biggest things I’m looking out for in my lifetime, is what leads to people policing people.</p>
<p>Which after the riots last spring, and the (of course warranted) discussions of defunding police and therefore how clear it is the police are no longer trusted or seen as safe, generally speaking...</p>
<p>It leads us to the next stage of people policing people. </p>
<p>That is bad bad bad news... </p>
<p>I’m not getting it either. I want more data. I work in software and I never install updates right away as there’s always bugs to be worked out. There’s a reason things are beta tested. I’m not going to be a guinea pig beta tester. </p>
<p>It weirds me out what’s going on...</p>

<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Thus why I laugh when I see people on here say they want to do away with government and have "people police each other". I'm like, "Dude...you think people policing people is the way to go after all the bullshit we've seen this year?" Because people are monsters, liars, and hypocrites. Imagine the neighbor who hates you turning you over for one of these benign "crimes" they are pushing, or someone turning an angry mob on you for wrongthink, and so on and so on.</p>

        <p>Exactly. And that’s what’s going on in places in China right now too. 
It’s a horrible idea. Look at what happened in nazi Germany as well.</p>
<p>Humans are not conscious enough to be able to police each other. I mean even the language ‘to police each other’ sounds horrible and sinister. It is soooooo shortsighted and ignorant ppl are not comprehending this. </p>
<p>I get more freaked out by the lack of intelligence and critical thinking around me every day. </p>
<p>I really hope it doesn’t go this way. But if I were a person or a group of people seeking to control a population, this would be the most intelligent way to do it. Turn us against each other instead of looking at the system. It’s very sadistic... </p>
<p>I don’t Like being so dark but I’ve seen enough in my own personal life to know what ppl are capable of. </p>
<p>More and more I’m like how am I going to navigate this life so I can thrive and grow throughout. I don’t want to get caught in a wave of darkness in a population. There’s just so much I want to do w this life and I’m fully aware even the best of us get impacted by tidal waves of trends.</p>

        <p>I feel like as a society, we have to seriously rethink what's worth turning in people to the authorities for. Whether it's around policing (which I'd like to see budgets massively cut <em>and redirected</em> for so that police are forced to concentrate on rape, murder and theft instead of masks and "loitering" and similar bullshit), or trying to get people fired via twitter mob.</p>

        <p>there is no situation where injecting aluminum and mercury has any favorable results. lol at fence-sitting "oh maybe it will be okay I'm just taking precautions". take a hard stance and grow a spine. you know it's health-averse, and in some people, will be the snowflake that bends the leaf of the bamboo (death).</p>
