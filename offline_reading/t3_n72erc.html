    <strong>I've lost my only reason to live because of this fucking HOAX</strong>
    <p><p>I don't know if this is the right place, or if anywhere is. I was engaged to the greatest girl I've ever known in my life. We're from two different countries. In recent years, we've made many trips back and forth and met in other places, to spend time together and prepare to make a future. I was quite ready to end my life around the time we met and I only stayed in this rotten, piece of shit world because of her. Even with massive depression, years of chronic pain, ptsd, etc. just making her smile and feel loved and protected made it all worthwhile. Then came the plandemic and lockdowns. I felt hopeless but she insisted all would go back to normal and we'd be together again and married soon. Then as we all know, they kept moving the goalposts farther and farther. After over a year of this, her own depression couldn't handle it anymore and she told me we'll never be allowed to see each other again and all of our dreams were dead and it was better to just end it than to deal with the pain of being kept apart forever and desperately waiting for things to go back to normal. This fucking travel shit has me stuck in a country where I don't know anyone, because I haven't lived in my birth country for years and had only come here for a "short time" to handle some things before the marriage. I'm completely alone, no life, just pain and depression and now lost the one and only thing that I still cared about in this shitty existence. There's no solution, other than an early death and I've accepted that. Just wanted to put that out there, an account of yet one more among the many of lives ruined by this fucking game that the ptb are playing with the world.</p></p>

        <p>sorry to hear that. plenty of reasons to live! we need people like you who see all this for what it is. build yourself up. try and get better physically. reach out to people around you, not just the internet. you can find another person but she shouldn’t be your life purpose. because were it not or the lockdowns, she could’ve still left you anyway.</p>
<p>find a deeper purpose. consider faith. turn inward and find what excites you. go down that path and see where you end up.</p>
<p>don’t quit just yet.</p>

<p>Buddy, seek real life therapy, not internet therapy. This just isn't a healthy place for it. Use a professional hotline, or see a local trained therapist for your own sake. Please.</p>

        <p>Jesus, dude, man up and stop blaming the world for your problems.  No relationship is going to stop you from the kind of depression and self hatred you described, work on yourself before dragging some woman into it.</p>

        <p>You’re right, and people in some countries have it far worse than where I live.  But still, this guy is showing clear signs of a depression that existed long before COVID.</p>
