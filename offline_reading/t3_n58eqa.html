        <p>What is an immunity passport or a risk-free certificate and what is WHO’s view of this?</p>
<p>Some governments have suggested that the detection of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, could serve as the basis for an “immunity passport” or “risk-free certificate” that would enable individuals to travel or to return to work assuming that they are protected against re-infection. At this point in the pandemic, there is not enough evidence about the effectiveness of antibody-mediated immunity to guarantee the accuracy of an “immunity passport” or “risk-free certificate.” That is, there is currently no evidence to determine whether or not people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection.</p>
<p>WHO view on the use of an "Immunity passports" in the context of COVID-19 is available here: https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/immunity-passports-in-the-context-of-covid-19</p>

        <p>For 6 months? That seems to be a consensus on how long the jab immunity lasts. Did I miss that part in their definition?</p>

        <p>Rockefeller Syndicate controls Pharma, UN/WHO, CDC, AMA, CFR etc.</p>
<p><strong>“Although the Rockefellers preferred not to be openly identified with the UN, they overtly dominated every move of its founding.”</strong> ^1</p>
<p>“On Oct. 24, 1949, four years after the charter went into effect, the cornerstone was laid for the <strong>U.N. headquarters</strong> building near the East River in mid-Manhattan. <strong>Nelson Rockefeller arranged for the purchase, after an initial offer to locate it on the Rockefeller family estate in Westchester County was rejected as being too far from New York City.</strong> The $83.4 million purchase — as adjusted to reflect current dollars — was funded by Nelson Rockefeller’s father, John D. Rockefeller Jr., who donated the land to the city.” ^2</p>
<p>”In 1977, the Declaration of <strong>Alma Ata</strong> gave to the World Health Organization (WHO) the means to extend the Flexner Report not only in North America, but throughout the entire world...<strong>Control of health, therefore, was transferred from national governments to a world government.</strong> A world government that is non-elected. And of which its "Surgeon General" in charge of health is the WHO.” ^3</p>
<p><strong>”But who actually controls that the WHO?</strong> That is the question. And also the answer. The United Nations (UN), the political arm of world financiers, that includes those who backed the Flexner Report and its application. More and more subtly, the medical and <strong>political authorities are robbing us of what is ours,</strong> as well as our rights. They establish the rules and make the laws that exploit us. It is a <strong>regime of medical terror.</strong> It is a world monopoly.”</p>
<p>"We know <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/10396382">the only people who benefited were pharmaceutical companies.</a> They had a huge influence in <strong>defining what a pandemic is."</strong>
<em>-Newport West MP Paul Flynn, 2010</em></p>
<p><strong>CDC</strong> is an outgrowth of Rockefeller’s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/history/index.html">MCWA</a> and helps with <a href="https://uncoverdc.com/2021/01/25/have-400000-americans-died-of-covid-19/">cooking the books.</a></p>
