    <strong>Health Passport 2021</strong>
    <p><p>The “Health Passport” will be introduced in late 2021. You can get acquainted with some of the features you can expect and some tips on how not to get your Health Pass suspended, by reading this informative brochure! </p>
<p>All Americans will be required to download the Health Pass™️ on their smartphone. You will be able to upload a copy of your negative PCR test or Vaccination certificate in order for the QR code to activate. </p>
<p>At first it will only be for Airline travel and events larger than 5k attendees, most people won’t mind sacrificing a little bit in order to take an occasional flight.... 
but soon it will become mandatory to enter Federal buildings, events over 2k then 1k then 500, but as Covid cases continued to rise due to the mandatory 50+ cycle PCR testing it slowly became mandatory to go to work or school, enter all public buildings, go to the grocery store, exit the country, go to the gym, use public transportation, buy gas, use atm’s, conduct financial transactions, get a taxi, use Uber eats, or enter shopping malls, stores restaurants or movie theatres..... in fact before anyone really realizes it you will not be able to participate in society whatsoever without a valid Health Pass. </p>
<p>There will be some protests to be sure, but following an afternoon of maskless protesting the attendees will all don their mandatory double mask asbestos face shield combos and begrudgingly whip out their Health Pass to unlock their personal vehicles or use public transport to get home. </p>
<p>The negative PCR option will slowly phased out too. It was problematic to begin with: The high false positive rate after 50+ amplification cycles will mean that many people will get notifications to report for mandatory 14 day quarantine at local FEMA crises management centers. The daily schedule will include a curriculum published by the Bill and Melinda Gates designed to encourage vaccination and healthy dose of synthetic bug protein. 
At first a negative test will be valid for 1 week, then 3 days, then 24 hours before being phased out completely and seasonal vaccination becoming the only option to participate in society.</p>
<p>Not all is bad news however, the Health Passes will allow the authorities to crack down on misinformation and undesirable activities. </p>
<p>If you commit any thoughtcrimes, such as making Facebook posts which circulate misinformation, attend unauthorized protests, display disruptive behavior or refuse to abide by the sanitary restrictions, your Helth Pass may be suspended pending further investigation. </p>
<p>For minor thoughtcrimes your health pass will restrict you to financial transactions 5k and under, restrict you from exciting the country or flying, from buying gas more than once every 3 days and from being more than 50km from your residence. </p>
<p>For level 2 thoughtcrimes, you will be restricted to 10km from your residence, financial transaction under 1k, banned from public transportation and your health pass will allow you to enter only government buildings, grocery stores, hospitals and pharmacies. </p>
<p>If you commit a level 3 thoughtcrime you will be restricted to 30$ per day in UberEats purchases and if your health pass is scanned by law enforcement and you are found outside of your residence you will be subject to arrest. New police powers allow them to spot check your Helth Pass at anytime to make sure that your activities are authorized for your Pass level. Pass, Bitte!</p>
<p>Any undesirable behavior will result in an immediate reduction in privileges by changing the authorization settings on your Helth Pass, nothing must threaten the Volksgesundheit. </p>
<p>Also, the government will start selling your Helth Pass data to Z-berg and Bezoz. They will track your every activity in order to provide you with a tailor made advertisement experience! What a treat. </p>
<p>In fact, before flashing your Helth Pass you will need to watch a YouTube style advert. Want to go into Hot Topic at the mall? Gotta watch a 20 second video ad before your QR code becomes available. Want to fill up your vehicle with gas? Gotta watch a 20 second diatribe from EPA deputy director Greta Thunberg  before your Helth Paz QR code authorizes your purchase!</p>
<p>Soon the facial detectors in the iPhone 15’s forward camera will pause the advert unless your eyes are open and directed towards the screen. Checkout lines will be full of zombies watching their mandatory Pfizer/BLM/Biden re-election advertisement, if they avert their gaze or close their eyes the ad will pause and they will not be able to scan their Helth Paz to complete their purchase. </p>
<p>Of course, plot twist: you won’t be “purchasing” things for very long anyway. Pretty soon you’ll own nothing and you’ll be happy.</p></p>
