<title>Should I wait out the mask requirement at work, or just find a new job now? They keep giving me the runaround on when unvaccinated associates don’t have to wear masks, &amp; keep blaming it on OSHA.</title>

        <p>My work was doing the same until we called/emailed OSHA.</p>
<p>My work was blaming OSHA saying they’re still requiring these rules. Well everything OSHA said was follow our states mandated/emergency orders which our state had fully lifted all rules and emergency powers had ended.</p>
<p>Literally the next day we came into work with signs saying “unvaccinated people strongly encouraged to wear masks but not required.”</p>
<p>Whole shop dropped mask instantly.</p>

        <p>Yes, if there is no emergency mandate from government or otherwise, immediately stop wearing the Mask and grant no medical authority to your employer on the matter.</p>

        <p>I called claiming to be a business owner. Never said my name or my company name. </p>
<p>I basically played the card of “hey I’m a business owner and I just want to be following the proper rules so as to not be fined.”</p>
<p>They basically explained that since the mandates were over and the governors emergency executive orders had expired and the state was open that businesses could set their own rules in place. Which was the OPPOSITE of what my employer was saying. I had them email this and also printed out a few pages from the OSHA website which I turned into the manager who then had a meeting with the owners.</p>
<p>I’m 100% positive the owners KNEW the rules they just wanted to keep employees muzzled up for as long as possible. As soon as they were aware we were fed up and speaking with OSHA the rules literally changed overnight.</p>
<p>Best of luck!</p>

        <p>The job is Publix, &amp; I have great health insurance &amp; retirement plan there. But if I have to wear a mask for 20 more years till I retire, I’m willing give that all up. Been there for 15 years &amp; thought this would be my career.</p>

        <p>Read my original post, and don't comply in any way.. Put the ball in their court instead.</p>
<p>If they fire you , they have to write a reason, then you can have something to take them to court over.</p>
<p>In some ways, my point is moot anyway, because they got you to wear a Mask at work (<em>without a government mandate</em>), so medical authority has already been granted.. :/</p>

        <p>Before you quit I would talk to an employment lawyer. I’d ask if you can treat this as a termination of employment ( they are changing your terms of employment without your consent)...perhaps they will have to pay you severance, just a thought if you’re serious about leaving the company.</p>

        <p>I was just inside a Publix near me last week and only some employees were wearing masks, does it depend on your position in the company? Or is it dependent on the store?</p>

        <p>Vaccination status. The store you were in might have a lot of vaccine compliance. They only allow employees who took the vaccine to not wear them. I currently just wear it as a chin diaper, but just the fact of being forced to take the vaccine to not have to wear it at all, doesn’t sit right with me.</p>

        <p>If you stay, do not engage in any way discussion of your medical status, and keep putting it off as long as possible. Do not give in.</p>
<p>If you must give in because they cornered you and you can't handle the pressure, you can use "I do not discuss my medical status or information with anyone other than my family doctor" then never engage, discuss, debate or try to 'educate' any further. </p>
<p>If you can't handle that pressure, then find a job that respects your rights and dignity.</p>
<p>Comply in any way, and they have medical authority over you, and there is no stopping them.</p>
