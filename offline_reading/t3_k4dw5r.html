    <strong>Profound thought of the day</strong>
    <p><p>The internet was a tool designed to connect everyone; it's now being used to divide us and create the illusion of isolation.</p>
<p>I come from the ".com" era where nobody gave 2 flips about the legitimacy of the information posted online.</p>
<p>It brought us gems such as...</p>
<p>The Triforce hunt in Zelda: Ocarina of Time</p>
<p>LonelyGirl15...nuff said</p>
<p>The Bill Gates free money scam</p>
<p>The stupid chain emails</p>
<p>The email tax ðŸ¤£</p>
<p>The "L is real" Luigi unlock from Mario 64</p>
<p>Mew is under the gotdamn truck (Keep trying to this day)</p>
<p>The list goes on.</p>
<p>Anyway, as a data engineer all of your "feeds" and search "results" are curated by people in a semi supervised machine learning model. What this means is people within the system can give precedence to data they want you to see first by scoring it higher and feeding it back into the machine learning models. This ranges from Twatter to Gargle to Farcebook to Instaham. </p>
<p>Are these platforms violating your constitutional rights? Nope! You are at the mercy of the beautiful little checkbox "I Agree to the Terms &amp; Conditions of XYZ inc" when you sign up for an account. They can do whatever they feel like with your feeds, your posts and any of your data as these are private, "for profit" organizations.</p>
<p>The solution? Stop using these platforms! I've never felt more liberated since deleting all of my social media accounts. I've found more friends and support locally than I have online. This is probably one of the last sane corners of the internet. We are in a real life "Allegory of the Cave" situation, where people believe the shadows on the wall are reality and refuse to come outside to seek their own truth.</p>
<p>The driver? Fear. Fear of death and fear of the unknown. A lot of people are wearing the mask out of fear, and it's their mental safety net. I guarantee the majority are wrestling with the reality of life and death and their own mortality. We need to remind them that it's ok and provide them an alternative. </p>
<p>It scares me when people are talking about "experts"; they often refer to people like Bill Gates and our Politicians. These are the least qualified people to talk about pandemics, how to handle them and the solution. From an abstract point of view, these people were brainwashed into believing a software developer and a bunch of lawyers. This is because of the power and money they hold over the world.</p>
<p>TL;DR the internet is being manipulated to trick us into believing there are more of them than there are of us, when quite the opposite is true.</p>

        <p>According to a post of yours, youâ€™re only 18. You have so much life left to live, I promise that you donâ€™t want to spend it being this bitter. Figure yourself out and dedicate your time to things that make you happy. You might think that knocking other people brings you joy, but thatâ€™s not real joy, itâ€™s a temporary high that masks your real feelings. I wish you all the best in life, you deserve to be happy.</p>

        <p>"I remember what the Internet was like before it was being watched, and there's never been anything in the history of man that's like it.  I mean, you could again have children from one part of the world having an equal discussion where, you know, they were sort of granted, um, the same respect for their ideas and conversation, with experts in a field from another part of the world, on any topic, anywhere, anytime, all the time.  And it was free and unrestrained.</p>
<p>And we've seen, uh, the chilling of that and the cooling of that and the changing of that model, toward something in which people self-police their own views, and they literally make jokes about ending up on "the list" if they donate to a political cause or if they say something in a discussion.</p>
<p>Uh, and it's become an expectation that we're being watched.  Um, many people I've talked to have mentioned that they're careful about what they type into search engines because they know that it's being recorded.  And that limits the boundaries of their intellectual exploration.  Uh... and I'm... I am more willing to risk imprisonment, or any other negative outcome, personally, than I am willing to risk the curtailment of my intellectual freedom and that of those around me whom I care for, uh, equally, as I do for myself.  And again, that's not to say that I'm self-sacrificing, because it gives me...  I feel good in my human experience to know that I can contribute to the good of others."</p>
