    <strong>Mask sharing is more common than you think .</strong>
    <p><p>Awhile back, I made a post about why masks shouldn't be mandated, specifically the angle of sanitary issues. I explained that it puts people in desperate situations where they NEED a mask to enter a business, and they sometimes trade hygiene for what's available. People are not properly trained to wash their hands before and after touching it, etc.</p>
<p>I was harassed and insulted by one of our "special visitors" and told that this never happens. That I was making up off the wall scenerios that don't happen in real life.</p>
<p>Well I'd like to give you all an update  and report that in the past 2 weeks, I have witnessed 2 incidents of mask sharing. Both times were at work, which is a long term care facility (people who have knowledge of basic universal precautions). One person was a higher up administrator (boss).  I can imagine how many times it's happened if I've seen it twice in such a short span of time.</p>
<p>When people are forced to wear masks, and it's non-negotiable, they end up in situations where they are "in a pinch".  People are nasty, and masks give them a new outlet for their nastiness.</p></p>

        <p>My partner and I share a bandana if we need to. We kiss each other and already share the same air and home biome. They're the only person I'd share with, though, and it's pretty limited in number of occurrences. Like, I don't use their toothbrush, but in an emergency, I would comfortably do so if needed. Same outlook on the face covering, I guess.</p>

        <p>One of my teens reuses a few disposable masks for weeks at a time, leaving them wherever. There's usually one or two in my vehicle at any time. I was giving another kid a ride to an event last week, and she said "oh, I forgot my mask." I said, "no problem, you'll be fine without one here." Or you can check the glovebox or backseat for one of X's masks. Without batting an eye, she checked for the other kid's used gross mask. Happily she didn't find one, so we both went in maskless.</p>

        <p>I literally handed my mask to a friend last summer so she could go into a building to take out money. I didn’t even think twice about the hygiene of it. Just “oh I have one and you don’t. Here, take mine so you can go inside there”</p>
