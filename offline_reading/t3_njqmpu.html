    <strong>I'm writing "COVID: The Movie".</strong>
    <p><p><strong>EXT. WENDY'S RESTAURANT - DAY</strong>  </p>
<p>Local fat man and burger aficionado, Paulie "Pugface" Puddington, huffs and wheezes his way up to the main entrance. He brings his inhaler up to his mouth and takes three big puffs, before stuffing it back into his fanny pack. He then tugs his soiled mask up from below his multiple chins and over his face, making sure to leave his nose uncovered, before entering the establishment and approaching the counter.  </p>
<p><strong>PAULIE:</strong> Yeah, I'll have six Bac-urp-Baconators. And double up that bacon on 'em. And also butter the bacon, geh-heh-heh.  </p>
<p><strong>CASHIER:</strong> [VISIBLY DISTURBED] Okay, that will be... $48.54.  </p>
<p><strong>PAULIE:</strong> [PAYS IN CASH, MAKING ONLY UNCOMFORTABLE FAT-MAN NOISES]  </p>
<p>A few minutes later, Paulie receives his order and shuffles to the nearest table about six feet away, where he sits down, removes his mask, and begins to sloppily dig into his heart with a rusty spoon, figuratively speaking. A mother and her child walk by his table, wearing masks, but well within six feet. Paulie scowls at them.  </p>
<p><strong>PAULIE:</strong> [SPEAKING LOUDLY WITH HIS MOUTH FULL, SPRAYING BACONATOR DROPLETS] Hey! Ain't you heard'a social distancing!? Nyeeh-HUUUUGH! BLAAARGH!!! HNNGH...!  </p>
<p>Paulie enters into a vicious fit of coughing, clutching at his chest. He falls to the floor and dies of a heart attack almost immediately. His death would later be classified as "with COVID".</p></p>
