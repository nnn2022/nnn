    <strong>What legal action can I take against people who are trying to foist this "new normal" nonsense on me?</strong>
    <p><p>I've been working back in person for awhile and tried to shake my CEO's hand today and he refused. He told me that even though he is vaccinated (I'm not obviously, I'm not a sheep) he doesn't feel "comfortable" doing this normal, every day, business routine of a damn handshake. And to my surprise most others in the office agreed with him! I was told that I should not force people to shake hands with me and can not force people to be closer with me than they want to be. Now I have to book extra large conference rooms for just 4 person meetings, because everyone wants to sit with three seats in between them! My office mate also requested to switch offices because her brother died from covid and she claims to have "health issues" himself, so she does not want to share a small space with someone who hasn't gotten the vaccine and refuses to wear a mask (me because they are both unnecessary imo). This wasn't a problem with our company since we have many empty office but it was a problem to me. It feels discriminatory. If I asked to switch because I didn't want to share an office with a woman that would certainly be an issue. This does not seem fair or normal and I certainly don't want it to become the new normal. They claim to allow non vaccinated people to work in their office but clearly they are making it a hostile environment for me. What can I do to address this? There has to be a legal route I can take here. This is far too much</p></p>

        <p>Have you tried finding a new job? One where you see eye to eye with management? Sounds like your the only wolf in the group. You will probably be over looked for promotions where you work, they prefer yes sheeple</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry you're experiencing discrimination and being ostracized at work. I'm feeling pretty down today myself. Got told by someone at work that by refusing the vaxx then I could be let go. Apparently I'm lowering morale (wtf?) by not taking it, as others have said to management that they don't want to take it either, and as someone others look up to I am being a bad role model. At this rate, I want to give up and not wake up tomorrow.</p>

        <p>Thank you so much. Not feeling happy at all with today's interaction, and I expect worse to come. But thank you for your support. The person who spoke to me is someone of high authority within the company, and it looks like I can kiss my career goodbye, but maybe that's okay. I wanted to quit for a while. I find I don't like being considered a robot at work. I'm a human being. Cheers. :)</p>

        <p>Just take it as weirdness of your employers and colleagues. As long as they don't force you to do something to yourself it's their right to act according to how they feel whether it's rational or not. If you want to take action do it smartly and definitely do not prioritize potentially making hostile people you depend on.</p>

        <p>to be honest with you discrimination cases (I'm assuming the US) is best handled on a state by state basis (i.e. depends on where you live)- most discrimination rights are based there - there are some but not many federal laws that prevent many kinds of discrimination</p>

        <p>well - be careful HR protects the company not you particularly - if you are really feeling discriminated against I would suggest you contact your state first - and then perhaps a workers rights lawyer in your state</p>

        <p>CA for example has a lot of discrimination protection (you know to protect minority classes - be it race, sexual orientation, medical condition etc), but the law will definitely be different than say Idaho - doesn't mean it doesn't exist in your state, but rather each state will be nuanced into what is and is not considered discrimination - make sense?</p>

        <p>So here's a reality check;</p>
<p>You aren't being discriminated against. You made a choice concerning your health and those around you. Everyone else is doing the same thing. They believe, whether you think they are wrong or not, that you pose a non-zero risk for their medical health and safety.</p>
<p>In fact, its the people you are claiming are being "discriminatory" that are protected. Health discrimination laws are a thing. They protect individuals from not being discriminated or forced to do something against a doctor's recommendation (among other things). I.E. an employer saying you cannot come into work because you are vaccinated.</p>
<p>But hey good job "not being a sheep" I guess. Certainly no sheep in this subreddit 🙄</p>
<p>I look forward to the downvotes you "non-sheep" type people &lt;3</p>

        <p>I didn't see the comment, because I read the post and responded to the post...like any other normal person. The post itself is nowhere near far-fetched. People believe this shit.</p>
<p>This is a pretty bad "woosh" moment bud.</p>

        <p>Most normal people read the comments too, but whatever you say. No need to get so testy just because you didn't pick up on the fact that this post was nowhere near serious, "bud".</p>

        <p>but they read comments. there were less than 20 comments on this post when you responded. most people who read a post with so few comments figure "fuck it, i'll read the comments too". not you though, i guess. have a nice day!</p>
