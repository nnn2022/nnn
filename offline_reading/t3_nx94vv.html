        <p>So basically according to this person you have no right to be upset and concerned and it‚Äôs not having your rights taken away until you are literally held down against your will screaming for help as someone forces a needle into your arm? So we should wait for exactly that moment for this to be something we are then allowed to be upset about? Neat. How nice of him to point out that virtually nothing in between should concern anyone and it doesn‚Äôt count as having your rights taken away until there is an actual physical assault inflicted. üëçüèª</p>

        <p>If you have to tell people you did your part, constantly point out it‚Äôs for the greater good and shame anyone who has VERY LEGITIMATE CONCERNS over this ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù there is something going on with you that you aren‚Äôt admitting to yourself. A lot of the people doing this are cowardly liars. Evidence: many have repeatedly said I wear my mask for you.. ok fine, then why are you wearing a mask after you and everyone around you is vaccinated? What‚Äôs that ? You don‚Äôt trust that maskless people are vaccinated? But I thought the mask was for me? Now it‚Äôs for you ? Then there are the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm wearing a mask so no one thinks I‚Äôm a trump supporter/republican. Let‚Äôs not get into the constant references to science which is now entirely laughable. Glad you trust CDC and Fauci. They have such a great track record. Lord Fauci admitted he lied to you but you‚Äôre still worshipping him daily.</p>

        <p>Agreed but I would add they would love to cut to the chase and kill people who disagree. It's come to this. We are wished dead and dehumanized so they feel better wanting this.</p>

<p><em>"Have you ever heard of the Vaccine Riot?</em></p>
<p><em>Discussion</em></p>
<p><em>It happened in Rio de Janeiro in 1904. Basically there was a huge remodeling of the city and sanitation, and measures that were meant to reduce the spread of some diseases that were predominant at the time.</em></p>
<p><em>One of said measures, naturally was the vaccine, but unlike today, this was actually forced, like, kicking your door down and holding you down forced, I'm not even joking. And people weren't properly explained what that was, so they were rightfully scared. That and other factors lead to the Riot starting.</em></p>
<p><em>It's kinda funny that these idiots at NNN believe they are having their rights taken away and shit like that, while in reality it isn't anything more than a mild inconvenience. Y'all can search it up if you want to learn more about it, it was quite a mess.</em></p>
<p><em>Edit: people were also being kicked out of their homes, which were the slums at the time, so that the area could be remodeled."</em> end quote</p>
<p>according to u/luke2582</p>
<p>so being forced to take experimental dna altering covex drug against ur will =</p>
<p>= A mild inconvenience.</p>
<p>lol the only recourse against such tyrxnny is vxxlxncx and pxxn.</p>
<p>SHAME ON ALL THESE CXMMXXS!</p>
