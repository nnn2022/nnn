    <strong>The story of Theranos makes it hard to "trust the experts"</strong>
    <p><p>This definitely falls under confirmation bias but it's something a lot of people have failed to articulate and is fantastic ammo for the anti-mask, anti-lockdown argument.</p>
<p>The medical industry just a few short years ago was completely bamboozled by the biggest fraud in American history and it should be a giant red flag that the "experts" are clueless retards.</p>
<p>Stanford dropout Elizabeth Homes "invented" a machine that could do 200+ blood tests and be small enough to store on the counter at Walgreens and CVS. </p>
<p>She had no med school qualifications and merely sold the idea to family friends via patents that nobody was smart enough to actually look over. <a href="https://abovethelaw.com/2019/03/elizabeth-holmes-and-the-great-patent-scam/">They just took her word for it.</a></p>
<p>&rt;<em>However, as Nazer notes, “Holmes’s 2003 application was not a ‘real’  invention in any meaningful sense . . . Indeed, it’s fair to say that  Holmes’s first patent application was little more than aspirational  science fiction written by an eager undergraduate.” Nazer goes on to  note that the patent examiner for one of Holmes’s patents (U.S. Patent  No. 7,291,497) did review it closely (for technical issues), but “[w]hat  the examiner did not do . . . was ask whether Holmes’s ‘invention’ actually worked.”</em>  <strong><em>Holmes was granted a patent for an idea, but not one that could actually be practiced.</em></strong> </p>
<p>Once the ball got rolling, Holmes was able to build a company worth $9,000,000,000 off of just... word of mouth from other investors, who themselves couldn't actually vouch for the veracity of what she was intending to build. Some of these investors included General Mattis and Rupert Murdoch. "Experts."</p>
<p>Holmes appeared on the cover of Forbes, <a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2015/07/23/vice-president-joe-biden-theranos-elizabeth-holmes-newark-lab-test/">Biden called Theranos "the laboratory of the future"</a>, and several mags called her "the next Steve Jobs." Again, those are what the "experts" said about her.</p>
<p>I'll spoil it for you. It was all a scam. The company literally did nothing and she now faces 20 years in prison.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/05/01/from-protegee-to-whistleblower-a-former-theranos-scientist-says-elizabeth-holmes-should-come-forward-and-apologize/">Had two of her employees not come forward and told the Wall Street Journal everything</a>, "experts" would still be parading her around as "the female Steve Jobs."</p>
<p>This same industry, who just two years ago were incapable of asking basic questions about a nine billion dollar company that suspiciously popped up overnight headed by a CEO with no qualifications at all, now work with local governments to determine if you can see your friends or go to sports games.</p></p>

        <p>Consistently, the media and government lie. Pathologically. And almost as consistently, the truth eventually comes out.</p>
<p>And yet, people <em>still</em> choose to believe them every time. It amazes me.</p>

        <p>This isn't an apt comparison. Rupert Murdoch is not an "expert" in medical science. Theranos fooled a lot of investors and politicians but most medical professionals (especially lab medicine people) were suspicious of them long before their downfall. Actual experts were largely not tricked.</p>

        <p>I never connected it either until my recent Theranos binge.</p>
<p>Created a company based on patents that didn't make any sense and there was no functional product. Misled investors who never once did a simple background check on her, which then caused other investors to jump on the bandwagon purely on word of mouth which means there are multiple layers of people just making a boneheaded decision. Used that money to build machines that <em>everyone in the company knew didn't work and were a giant scam</em>, then threatened them with lawyers if they spoke out - or forced them to sign NDA's and/or fired them for asking questions.</p>
<p>This goes on for an entire decade &amp; dupes so many people that even the future president of the United States vouches for her, without having any idea what he's actually looking at aside from the woman saying some vague medicine-ish things that he doesn't really understand but he pretends to anyways for optics and gives his metaphorical stamp of approval so it looks nice in the papers.</p>
<p>Whoops she's actually the most prolific scam artist in American history and everyone who has been singing her praises over the past decade - which, I dunno, includes some pretty important people and institutions - quietly wash their hands of it and act like we should continue trusting them.</p>
<p>Like, what if this is happening with Covid? All of these politicians and city officials might not even remotely understand what's going on but just say what they need to for a nice wholesome story in the papers and suddenly whoops we killed 90% of small businesses because we just took everyone else's word for it.</p>

        <p><strong>TLDR; when it comes to the most important decision of our time, they proved to be either stupid or evil</strong></p>
<p>At this blood test company, They were at least trying to make something though... they weren't completely maliciously just stacking investor's cash up in Swiss bank accounts and keeping a helicopter warmed up on the roof for a quick escape.... Which is better than some other sneaky SOBs out there LOL</p>
<p>That said our elites are not to be trusted and are demonstrably, at best, functionally retarded,  and at worst diabolical civilizational vandals, demonstrated by their execution of the process of globalization, which has seen the United States go from global hegemon in the '80s to teetering on the brink of destruction along several different fault lines now.</p>
<p>If these people cared about America, or if they were not imbeciles, they would not have sent the vast preponderance of our manufacturing base, the mainspring of our national prosperity, off to one of the most murderous totalitarian resumes ever to disgrace the planet, who's ideology called for our complete destruction and subjugation.</p>

        <p>You said it yourself, she had no med school qualifications. So why compare her to scientists who do have qualifications? She is a fraud, nothing she did was peer reviewed or posted in a scientific journal. There is no similarity between this and scientists who are doing research.</p>

        <p>It's because the mainstream media propped her up as an idol in the same vein as Bill Gates and Steve Jobs - people who were so successful in their field that any endeavor they embark upon should be world news. </p>
<p>If two random kids within Theranos don't come forward, this woman is bidding on (and potentially winning) a Covid testing contract using machines that don't actually work. We were <em>that</em> close to this whole thing being an even bigger clusterfuck because everyone else in the industry couldn't be trusted, and 99% of her own employees willingly went along with a scam company because their paychecks were that good.</p>

        <p>I don’t think mainstream media propped them up, their accomplishments did. Are you using an iPhone or Mac right now? Do you have a windows computer? You are baselessly accusing bill gates of fraud. </p>
<p>What are you even trying to prove? She is a fraud for a blood test machine, which doesn’t have anything to do with covid. Should we stop getting MRIs because of her? Can the manufacturers who make ventilators for covid patients be trusted? Yeah, you’re right let’s stop modern medicine because a woman is a fraud, so no one in the medical field can be trusted.
