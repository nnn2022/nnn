    <strong>Why are still so many people okay with everything?!</strong>
    <p><p>I just cannot wrap my head around the fact that there are still so many people who are not even trying to question anything. At this point I know that governments can do anything they want and people will still do whatever mainstream says.</p>
<p>It looks like we will face serious problems soon and I guess some people will only start to question things when they are seriously suffering.
Right now everyone is still too much in their comfort zone to see what's really going on.</p>
<p>Now they are pushing the delta and lambda variant narrative so everyone gets into the row for their 3rd shot. And that's when we will see more and more people actually dying from the vaccine. </p>
<p>Everyone needs to find a place where he wants to live for the next time because soon we won't be able to go somewhere else without the vaccine. </p>
<p>Indonesia has military checkpoints now, you can't leave without the vaccine passport. Bangladesh is having their 160mil people locked down. Sydney, Lissabon, UK.... Malta is only letting people in who are vaccinated. </p>
<p>Soon it's getting worse everywhere and I'm sure there will be food shortages all over because of "cyber attacks". If you don't obey and bow down where they want you to have you will suffer and they will let it become really, really bad that even the strongest of us will not be strong enough to stand against the tyranny.</p>
<p>I guess I just needed a little rant but we all should prepare for the worst about to come.</p>
<p>Take care, stay strong, never give up!</p></p>

        <p>They are too scared to admit to themselves what is really happening.  I guess if youve never really experienced "the system", you're able to trust it. I was a social worker for a long time and I know how the system abuses and experiments on the most vulnerable.  Now it is on a global scale.</p>

        <p>Humans don’t instinctually desire liberty, they desire safety. So they’re ok giving up some liberty for the feeling of safety.</p>

        <p>This is the nail being hit on the head. We assume people are like us and value liberty. Ultimately, we're animals and will prioritise safety over liberty, particularly if we can be made to feel fear. </p>
<p>My dog values her liberty, but she knows what side her bread's buttered! She knows that she's safe and happy with me, and she doesn't like to be apart from me for even a minute. So she has no desire to be in the wild whatsoever (I try to make her life as natural as possible, so she gets to be an animal not a toy). </p>
<p>Most people are in that dog-like state of believing that if they do as they're told, the authorities will give them a biscuit every so often. They don't realise that they're being manipulated. The only difference with people on here is that we do realise that we're being manipulated.</p>

        <p>Oh but if you were to post that people are dying from the vaccine anywhere, you can be sure you would get a ton of people saying your nuts and that no one has died from it. That’s their mindset. They are being controlled . They think they are better than us! Anyone with 1/2 a brain should question anything that the goverment and/or big pharma does!</p>

        <p>I am convinced they watch the nightly news every night. I have never watched the nightly news programs that follow the local news. Only ever watched the local news when there was a story of interest. Every time I go up to visit my parents, every night they watch the nightly news and holy shit……it is so far left and non stop fear mongering, hysteria and lies. Makes me feel incredibly anxious just over hearing it. I can see why people don’t question anything and believe what they the TV tells them is gospel. It’s beyond toxic.</p>

        <p>Because they’re being given the opium of the 21st century, attention and fake moral superiority. Do you think all the people who spend their entire day complaining and virtue signaling on social media are successful people of note? Or losers who’ve never been special in any way now being give a chance to feel “included” and “cool.” </p>
<p>Anybody who’s been jabbed thinks they’re the new saviors of the world. And that us “filthy plague rats” are what’s preventing them from doing so. Aka “getting back to normal.” </p>
<p>The problem is they’re too high on social media clout and irl browbeating struggle sessions to realize the they aren’t in control. They took the jab to “be free” while still being at the whims of the “medical” tyrants. Admitting this to themselves would be too hard, so they choose to delude themselves for their own mental preservation.</p>
