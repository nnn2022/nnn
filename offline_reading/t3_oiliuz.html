    <strong>Wuhan lab leak, chinese whistleblowers, gain of function research, ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine are ALL planted psy-ops that validate a deadly novel virus</strong>
    <p><p>If you buy into the whole Wuhan lab leak story, then you buy into a new deadly virus that was released into the public. If you buy into the effectiveness of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, then you buy into the need for a new treatment that is needed to combat a novel virus. This is called controlled opposition. They are planted counter narratives that validate the premise of the original psyop. The TPTB have done such a good job at demonizing anyone that questions the existence of COVID that even skeptics often start their rants with "I'm not a COVID denier but...". In a debate, the person with a positive claim has the burden of proof. There has been absolutely no proof of a novel virus. It was just told to us that there's a new virus and we just have to believe it. It is a belief system. Pseudoscience. Questioning the existence of COVID is not only reasonable--it follows good logic. </p>
<p>The official story is that dozens of people in Wuhan suddenly developed a fever, cough, sore throat, etc. And this indicated a new virus?!? I'm sorry but we've never seen a fever, cough and sore throat before? And so they looked at the lung fluid of three patients and determined the genetic sequence of this "mysterious new illness." How did they know this genetic sequence was novel? In what way can one determine that a genetic sequence has never existed before? My job required years of training but I can still explain my work to a layperson. A virologist should be able to explain how they know there is a novel virus. The truth is they already had it in their heads there is a novel virus because it's an agenda, folks. The response was already there. They just needed a story to make it all happen. Seasonal sickness has been relabeled as pandemic waves and it is being used to usher in medical tyranny. </p>
<p>Although many restrictions are being lifted around the world, I remain cautiously skeptical. I suspect this agenda will be in its next phase at this upcoming flu season, meaning more lockdowns with the blame being placed on the unvaccinated. </p>
<p>I pray God protects you all from this sick and wicked agenda üôè.</p></p>

        <p>The novel bit about this coronavirus specifically was the spike protein. 
At the start it was taking down people hard. Members of Iran's political party in power lost a couple of members after they contracted it. But all the way back then even, they talked about strains A and B. Strain A was supposedly contained in Dubai and strain B got out and kept evolving trying to kick out unnatural genetic modifications. It became much less lethal along the way, but that's not how it was reported by MSM... Who wanted a pandemic oh so badly.</p>
<p>Hydroxychloroquine is not new it's been around for 70 years. It's out of patent it's been around that long. Research on it's ability to disrupt viral replication when combined with zinc was going on in 2005, and has been proven in the field by doctors who were silenced for speaking about it's effectiveness. If hcq had on label covid-19 treatment approved, then the vaccines wouldn't be given emergency use authorisation.
Big pharma doesn't like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin because they don't own patents on em and so can't make money off them. Any chemical company can produce them cheaply, and all of this would end... They obviously don't want that .</p>

        <p>Okay so my mom is an avid CNN watcher, fully vaccinated etc. 
She‚Äôs blaming the unvaccinated but she understands my skepticism why I haven‚Äôt gotten a vaccine and respects my choice. Hell, I‚Äôm even sick right now with possibly the ‚ÄúDelta Variant‚Äù since it aligns perfectly with the symptoms (cough sniffles yet no loss of taste and smell ‚Äîliterally a common cold) and it‚Äôs summer time I‚Äôve literally never been sick in the summer time but I digress. </p>
<p>So we have some casual discussions/ disagreements but it‚Äôs fun and testing of my debate skills regarding Covid since it really doesn‚Äôt matter if I win or lose. Nobody‚Äôs going to force a shot on me but me. </p>
<p>Anyways she still believes that masks work but agrees they are dumb. But in the same breath regurgitates the notion: </p>
<p>Cases went down because of vaccines and masks, cases are going up because of the unvaccinated and people not wearing masks. And of course ‚Äúthose dumb red states and their low vaccination rates‚Äù bs. </p>
<p>To me that doesn‚Äôt make sense because if a population got vaccinated and cases went down to almost nothing, then there should be no spike thereafter. </p>
<p>But that‚Äôs where the psyop of muh variants comes in to throw a wrench into any discussion. </p>
<p>How do I debate these talking points and take blame away from ‚Äúthe unvaccinated‚Äù</p>

        <p>The only thing you have to do is read the original paper describing the pcr test. That paper was amended multiple times, including this year. And still starts with the same phrase‚Ä¶.bla bla no virus isolate available. Everything that follows is just made up bulshit.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn the present case of 2019-nCoV, virus isolates or samples from infected patients have so far not become available to the international public health community. We report here on the establishment and validation of a diagnostic workflow for 2019-nCoV screening and specific confirmation, designed in absence of available virus isolates or original patient specimens.‚Äù</p>

        <p>this is a great point, do you have any solid info that validates the theory of the media just labeling common illnesses such as seasonal flu as covid cases? i can get behind what youre saying and totally agree, understanding the real narrative is important</p>

        <p>I should've said "I suspect seasonal sickness has been relabeled as COVID." I apologize for the hypocrisy. If I had a smoking gun piece of evidence then this whole thing would be blown wide open and I wish I had it. That being said, Dr. Roger Hodkinson's (a respected Pathologist and professor in my city) interviews online where he calls the Rona a flu are an interesting watch. Another interesting tidbit of info is <a href="https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/the-good-news-still-no-flu-deaths-hospitalizations">last flu season there was 8,470 cases of the flu in my province. This flu season there is 0.</a> Also the people that I know who had COVID describe the exact same symptoms as any cold or flu. They get a fever and maybe a cough or a scratchy throat, they rest for a bit and then fully recover. In the early days of the pandemic when the overall infection facility rate was estimated at around 2%, Fauci stated in Navigating the Uncharted that if COVID had a IFR of less than 0.1% then it would be akin to the flu. We now know that the IFR is less than 0.1% for the vast majority of ppl. We also know that COVID has been classified as broad as possible (deaths are added to the COVID death toll regardless of cause in many countries if not most). I know this is the case in UK and Canada because the BBC stated so in fine print and I read Ontario's guidelines for classifying COVID deaths. By this alone we know that COVID numbers are inflated. Regardless of inflated numbers, we are either dealing with relabeled flu or a new virus that replaced the flu AND is very similar to the flu. Either way there is no justification for the restrictions or vaccinations that are being pushed onto the public.</p>
