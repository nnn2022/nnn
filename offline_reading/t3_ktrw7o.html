        <p>The doomers and pharma shills have to do their PR damage control wherever they can with this tragedy. Doctors (plural) were working on his case, and he still died. Why don't the doomers and pharma shills ever contact them and explain to them that it wasn't the vaccine? No, it's better just to defend their shoddy product like deluded fanboys.</p>
<p>Here is a transcript of what his wife wrote (the name omitted here but can be seen in the original publicly shared post):</p>
<p>"The love of my life [...] Died the day before yesterday due to a strong reaction to the COVID vaccine.   </p>
<p>He was a very healthy 56 year old, loved by everyone in the community delivered hundreds of healthy babies and worked tireless through the pandemic.   </p>
<p>He was vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine at MSMC on December 18, days later he saw a strong set of petechiae on his feet and hands which made him seek attention at the emergency room at MSMC. The CBC that was done at his arrival showed his platelet count to be 0 (A normal platelet count ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood.) he was admitted in the ICU with a diagnosis of acute ITP caused by a reaction to the COVID vaccine. <strong>A team of doctors tried for 2 weeks to raise his platelet count to no avail. Experts from all over the country were involved in his care. No matter what they did, the platelets count refused to go up. He was conscious and energetic through the whole process but 2 days before a last resort surgery, he got a hemorrhagic stroke caused by the lack of platelets that took his life in a matter of minutes.</strong>   </p>
<p>He was a pro vaccine advocate that is why he got it himself.   </p>
<p>I believe that people should be aware that side effects can happened, that it is not good for everyone and in this case destroyed a beautiful life, a perfect family, and has affected so many people in the community  </p>
<p>Do not let his death be in vain please save more lives by making this information news."

        <p>If the vaccine hurts people doesn’t that align with the Neo NoNew agenda? Mass death is not a cause for concern but this one death is the tipping point of when it’s time to start caring?</p>
