    <strong>In Nova Scotia, Canada - must self-isolate for 14 after gym exposure even with negative test</strong>
    <p><p>In Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada we have very few COVID-19 cases right now. We're basically going for the COVID-zero strategy. Yesterday, there were only 2 cases in a province of 1 million people and both cases were close contacts of previously reported cases. They discovered that someone with a positive case of COVID-19 was at a gym last week, and they want everyone who was in the weight lifting area of that gym at that time to self-isolate for 14 days, even if they have no symptoms, even if they had a negative COVID-19 test, and regardless of vaccination status.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nshealth.ca/news/potential-high-risk-exposure-covid-19-fit4less-halifax">https://www.nshealth.ca/news/potential-high-risk-exposure-covid-19-fit4less-halifax</a></p>
<p><em>Nova Scotia Health Public Health is advising of a potential high-risk exposure to COVID-19 at the Fit4Less Gym on Dresden Row in Halifax. Public Health is investigating a confirmed case of COVID-19 who spent time in the weight area.</em></p>
<p><em>Anyone who visited Fit4Less in the specified section of the gym on the specified date and time should self-isolate immediately and visit</em> <a href="https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/"><em>covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/</em></a> <em>to book a COVID-19 test, regardless of whether or not they have COVID-19 symptoms or call 811.</em> <strong><em>You must continue self-isolating for 14 days, whether or not you have symptoms, even with a negative test result.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Even if your test result is negative you must continue to isolate up to and including June 30, 2021 at 11:59 p.m., 14 days from the potential exposure due to coming in close contact with someone who had COVID-19. You will also need to get tested again between June 22-24 and June 28-30.</em></p></p>

        <p>I agree! When someone as high profile as Elon Musk gets four consecutive tests, back in November 2020, and two come back negative and two positive a lot of people now know that they're bogus! Still here we are using the same test to strip people of their human rights and freedoms.</p>

        <p>Jupp we live in a clown world.</p>
<p>In germany a study just came out looking at 190.000 Test-results. Finding was that over 80% were not infectious and basically false-positives due to too high ct-values. Nothing new here, but at least media starts reporting.</p>
<p>You would think that this might change things. But all they talk about now is: </p>
<p>If the PCR-Test doesnt work properly, what metric can we use to determine whether we can reopen or not...........................................................................</p>

        <p>This is actually the least of our worries and not anything new.</p>
<p>Among Nova Scotia's larger worries:</p>
<p>our court denied us the right to protest covid;</p>
<p>the military is engaged in the covid response;</p>
<p>we are supposed to get 85% of the eligible population "fully vaccinated" before we begin our "new normal";</p>
<p>Because of New Brunswick, which is no doubt by global design, none of the people in the Atlantic provinces can leave the area.</p>

        <p>It's absolutely fucked that they want 85% fully vaccinated before restrictions will be lifted. I don't even believe that. This fucking province will be the last place still restricted in the damn world. Well, maybe pei will out do Nova Scotia since that ass backwards province won't allow anybody 12+ not vaccinated to enter the province without isolation even from Atlantic Canada.</p>

        <p>I don't know how to PM but I am game for the private jet somewhere, I am in NS as well. I work from home and as long as I have internet access, I can work anywhere. I have been thinking about Belize maybe. I do have a dog that HAS to come with me, I would rather be in prison with my dog than anywhere free without him. I think there should be a collective group of people who want out of Commida's regime, plan something and get out.</p>

        <p>Ok, good to know there are similar minded folks out there. I will start putting something together like a community site so we can discuss possible destinations. There is no point escaping to another place just to be blocked from life again. I haven’t looked into Belize, just Florida and Mexico so far. I will not do a test or a vaccine so that complicates thinks. I’m also thinking a yacht charter could be the way as well.</p>

        <p>This province is a fucking joke. There's a reason why I never use by real information whenever these fucking places insist on contact tracing. At the gym it night be a bit different due to the way you have to sign in. But fuck isolating with no symptoms.</p>
