    <strong>Has anyone relocated to re-enter the "old normal"?</strong>
    <p><p>If so, what were your experiences?  Where did you start out, where did you move to?  How much of a difference did it make?  </p>
<p>I'm considering making some major, life-altering decisions in the next few months and want to be sure I'm not making a mistake.</p></p>

        <p>I haven’t relocated, but I have visited places that make me want to. My husband doesn’t want to hear about it, we have so many ties to our area and my parents think we need to fight for our state. I feel like my state is a lost cause, but whatever. If you are looking at the US I would say Florida, Montana, South Dakota, Texas, or even Georgia. </p>
<p>But like many people warn, don’t vote for the policies you are fleeing. </p>
<p>On a side note the property prices in my area have skyrocketed from people fleeing cities, so I could make a pretty penny if I could convince everyone to get out. Maybe the 4oz of red meat mandate they want to do will get them moving.</p>

        <p>With the inability to leave Canada myself, I opted to buy a house in a more rural town with about 10,000 people living there.. was the best I could do in my current situation. But fuck, was it worth every penny. I’m glad to finally be out of the major cities around here. It’s done a world of wonder for my over health and well being - I don’t regret my decision at all.</p>

        <p>I live in a town that size in Ontario and while lockdown somewhat stinks here, it sounds like it's nothing compared to what people in the cities have to deal with, like mandatory masking at playgrounds and fenced-off parks.</p>

        <p>Long time lurker here.  I made an account just to reply to this. </p>
<p>Late last year, my spouse and I decided to relocate from an east coast suburban area to rural Appalachia largely motivated by the possibility of SHTF but also just to escape.  I'll admit that when we moved, I was skeptical of COVID but still programmed with fear.  Our new place has had a profound effect on me to the contrary.   The mostly maskless locals were a bit intimidating at first, but I learned from them that I didn't have to be afraid.</p>
<p>Also, after a decade in suburbia, I was sick of it.  The "pandemic" amplified my disgust with people just being ugly to each other.  In rural Appalachia,  I have neighbors that will literally do anything for me while barely knowing me.  I return the favor of course at every opportunity.  The east coast elites have such a derogatory view of "uncultured" rural Americans, but I've found that the people where I live, though with less money or education, comprise the vastly superior culture in so many ways.</p>
<p>My new normal is actually much better than my old normal, and I'm never going back..  Best of luck to you in your decision.</p>

        <p>Ohio here. Looks ok but we want to see laws enacted to prohibit mandatory vaccine and passports. 
We are preparing by looking at property in Florida Tennessee. Mississippi and Iowa.  I think there is some wisdom in doing dry runs. Know what steps you would take if things happen . Make a plan.</p>

        <p>I moved to the city when the "second(third) wave" was coming.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I had a lot of things I needed to get done in the city and I lived 3 hours and about 4 police checkpoints away. I was worried that eventually they would force vaccinate or require testing to get through the checkpoints. So I moved.  </p>
<p>This is in Panama. Turns out the checkpoints went away and they lifted most restrictions. I'm still waiting to finish my final major thing, get my drivers license. That was part of why I needed to stop with the checkpoints, they were starting to ask for that (I've been driving without one for 2 years, I was able to use the COVID thing as an excuse but now that doesn't work).</p>

        <p>I moved from Portland, OR (as locked down as CA or NY in my opinion) to a suburb in Oklahoma.</p>
<p>It’s made a huge difference. Night and day, as the old saying goes. It took a lot of energy and money and sacrifices to move and I don’t regret it at ALL. I feel sick when I imagine having waited any longer than I did.</p>
<p>Masks are optional in Oklahoma. People aren’t scared of Covid. They aren’t as rabidly “over it” as Florida (I fucking love Florida) but they are just politely like, no thank you I choose not to be hysterical about this. </p>
<p>People are friendly. Strangers chat you up. There’s a sense hopefulness and a sense that the future exists at all, which i didn’t feel on the west coast. People laugh and smile at each other. There are open-air festivals. Bars are open. I guess it’s not totally old normal yet but there’s a sense of the very inevitable and impending return to the old normal. </p>
<p>It’s coincidental but worth noting that many of the open states are in the south where both the weather and the people are warmer and more hospitable. There is more sunshine and vitamin D, which is a mood booster. Abandoning the constant gloomy skies and endless winter of Portland has been a pleasant advantage. </p>
<p>I love seeing people’s faces. I love driving by the park and seeing rec softball and soccer games with players and fans maskless and cheering. I love being treated with kindness by strangers (and cashiers and waitresses) instead of suspicion. I love seeing neighborhood kids playing in the street together and horsing around. </p>
<p>For me, life’s too short to live in a lockdown state.</p>

<p>The question is, why are you moving? Are you moving rural from city? Or from city to city with laws you like more?</p>

        <p>I'm drawn to the idea of a city with laws that I prefer and a population that isn't brainwashed.  Like this past weekend I was on a trip, and it was beyond satisfying when I used the lace veil I was using as a "mask" to play peek-a-boo with a random baby in an elevator, and got all the adults laughing, too.  I need to be around a population that's into spontaneous interactions like that.</p>

        <p>I'm just about to since I'm fortunate enough to be a considerably-freer state than my current hellhole. Just need some work and housing lined up. I'm getting the fuck out while the getting is still good. Before our state dictator starts posting the NG at the borders and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schie%C3%9Fbefehl">has them start  shooting people for trying to escape our new normal paradise.</a></p>
<p>I'm only being half facetious when I say that would happen too.</p>
