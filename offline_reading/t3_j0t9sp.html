        <p>And trust me, there’s a lot more than just 48,000  positive cases. Most people I know at college right now refuse to get tested (even when their college emails them that they’ve been “randomly selected for a test”—they just ignore it) so that they aren’t forced off campus if they happen to test positive. </p>
<p>Doomers probably think that sounds selfish, but when 99.9999% of people in college who test positive are asymptomatic or have nothing more than a light cough, it doesn’t really matter if the virus spreads around the college campus. Let the young get it with no consequences and allow us to move closer to herd immunity. Plus, it’s not like we force kids to return home whenever they get the flu, and this is less of a threat than the flu for people in their age group.</p>

<p>There can be people who are asymptomatic spreaders of the virus. That's why it's been so tough to tackle, and why testing and following guidelines are so important.</p>

        <p>&rt;Why aren't these spreaders sick?. Why doesn't all these people who "test positive " get sick?</p>
<p>Because the symptoms of the disease are dependent on our immune system recognising the virus as a threat. Not all viruses present in the human body are recognised as threats, in fact a significant portion of our DNA is made of viruses which integrated with our genome.</p>
<p>&rt;Why is the country and all the sheep in it walking around wearing masks</p>
<p>Because masks are effective at reducing the spread of aerosolised droplets of water from our breath, which is what the virus travels in from person to person.</p>
<p>&rt;like mindless drones afraid of a flu virus with a 99% survival rate according to the cdc.</p>
<p>Because we care about one another. Or at least <em>some</em> of us do.</p>
<p>And don't liken COVID-19 to the flu and call me a dummy at the same time. Influenza and coronavirus are different families of diseases with different symtoms and differing mortality rates.</p>

        <p>WHO and CDC say asymptomatic spread is very rare. You are living in March.</p>
<p>Testing is not important. They run a 40-45 cycle instead of 25-30 to make certain they find any viral fragments, which is a new CASE and provides more back up to keep lockdowns around. It's all really scammy and stupid. (I had Covid. It is nothin' compared to swine flu. That was horrific.)</p>

<p>Lockdowns are effective. You can see that in the data for every single country which enacted them, and how they saved lives.</p>

        <p>All the models they use are based on Diamond Princess cruise ship article from February. That article states:</p>
<p>Our estimated asymptomatic proportion is at 17.9% (95%CrI: 15.5–20.2%), which overlaps with a recently derived estimate of 33.3% (95% confidence interval: 8.3–58.3%) from data of Japanese citizens evacuated from Wuhan [13]. Considering the reported similarity in viral loads between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients [14] and that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic cases may be possible, even though there is no clear evidence as yet of asymptomatic transmission, the relatively high proportion of asymptomatic infections could have public health implications. For instance, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that contacts of asymptomatic cases self isolate for 14 days.</p>
<p>You can see that they aren't writing that they have proved asymptomatic transmission, just that there was a large amount of people who tested positive and we're asymptomatic infections.</p>
<p>Unless I missed it in the article you linked, they weren't set on proving or disproving whether people can infect others while being asymptomic. It was mostly updating models and projections on how many asymptomic and presymptomatic % of cases. Which is useful for figuring out the overall severity of disease.</p>
<p>https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.10.2000180/</p>
<p>Basically we know and have proven that people will have asymptomatic infections, I haven't seen any study proving that transmission is possible. Usually scientists are pretty upfront about telling readers that we still don't know if transmission is possible. The problem is mask mandates rely completely on everyone believing asymptomatic transmission is proven possible and driving the spread. The only reason they give for making everyone who feels healthy to mask up is that you might be asymptomic and spreading it by breathing to heavily. I wish there was good science to back that claim up.</p>

<p>Why? Because the police raided the place for illegal partying because of the coronavirus. How people from that country hasn't gotten rid of their regime is a scary. That people just take these things instead of fighting back.</p>
