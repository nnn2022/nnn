    <strong>About covid restrictions and people that support them... (Translated, so there might be spelling mistakes)</strong>
    <p><p>It is not true that most people want the epidemic to be ended. Most people like the current political situation very much. Most people wholeheartedly supported the introduction of lockdowns, restrictions and restrictions, and will defend this status quo to the end. Because most of the so-called society is nothing but ordinary, smelly cattle with a slave mentality - and the present times are a fulfillment of their innermost dreams.  </p>
<p>This is what they wanted, global totalitarianism - and they got it. Because they hate freedom, they don't want it, they are afraid of it, and they are happy when someone takes it from them. After all, there are so many temptations in this world, so many traps ... In addition, what is worse, in life sometimes you have to make a cyborg and then bear its consequences. A scary thing for them.  </p>
<p>External world is terrifying to them, they cannot find themselves in it; only covid and covidianism offer them what they really want. Simple instructions. Sit on your ass. Don't leave home. Wear a muzzle. Curfew from x hour to y hour. Simple commands, as to a dog.</p>
<p>Finally, they know how to live, how to fill their time, and finally the meaning of life is explained to them (they live to be vaccinated). That the economy is destroyed - they don't care, because they live off social benefits anyway. That it is forbidden to travel, that cultural and musical events were liquidated – they do not give a damn, because they do not travel anywhere, and they do not attend any cultural events, and now they have fun that others cannot either. It’s Schadenfreude – happiness from someone else's suffering – “It doesn’t matter that I suffer, the only important thing is that neighbor suffers more”</p>
<p>Covidianism feeds on the vilest human instincts, fear and envy. And that's why cattle will defend this covid to the end. Because people simply need a whip over themselves. There used to be a Cold War whip and a nuclear arsenal hanging overhead - and now there is a covid whip, used well on the same principles. If covid was not there, it would have to be invented ...</p></p>
