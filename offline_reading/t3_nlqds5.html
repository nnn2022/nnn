    <strong>I have cystic fibrosis and had COVID. Here is what I did to recover...</strong>
    <p><p>There is no justification for submitting to experimental RNA therapy when safe and effective treatments are available. And they ARE available, to me and to you and to everyone who is open minded enough to try them. My trials in this life and largely healing from my condition have taught me that there is so much we do not know about reality. When in doubt, the least intrusive and more established approach to the treatment of disease is a good first line of defense. Maybe this is a bad analogy, but why cut off your head to cure a headache when simply painkillers will do? </p>
<p>In a nutshell, having cystic fibrosis makes me severely immunocompromised. It is largely a lung disease and creates severe lung damage over time.  I had COVID in December and recovered using nano silver, a single dose of ivermectin, vitamin d (50,000 units), liposomal vitamin c (a lot, I don’t remember exact amount), zinc, and IV glutathione. I have not had noticeable damage to my lungs, as reflected by stable FEVs. </p>
<p>A healthy body is a strong immune system. This is your first line of defense. Instead of fighting the symptoms of dis-ease, do all you can to support your body’s immunity so that you will never get sick: high quality diet (organic if possible), supplemental iodine, fulvic minerals, zinc, vitamin C, vitamin D. I also regularly use kambo, but not everyone has access to that. </p>
<p>Why is this ideology of immune defense not being as heavily pushed as injecting this experimental therapy? Now we’re being bribed with donuts and lollipops and senseless virtue signaling to get this jab...huh? This is totally backward. </p>
<p>Do not be fooled—You are STRONG you are POWERFUL and you are FREE. Despite what you have been led to believe, you have sovereignty over your body and anyone who cannot respect that—social pressure to get the vaccine—does not respect YOU at a fundamental level. Do not cave. It is always the right time to stand up and do what’s right, even if you are viciously defamed and shunned. Stick to your guns—you’re not alone in recognizing this insanity for what it is.</p></p>

        <p>Thank you so much for this post! I agree!!!! I also have 3 people in my life with CF who have been SO out of their minds with worry &amp; fear the last year. I am SO happy to hear you were able to recover without long term effects. Thank you again! Great message!</p>

        <p>Thank you for your response. Worry and reliance on medicine is pushed heavily on us from an early age, stripping us of our self empowerment over what is done to our bodies. It is high time we take that power back and stop seeing ourselves as victims—it’s a tricky mindset to get out of when it’s been so relentlessly shoved down our throats from day one, but if we break that hold over us, well...the sky’s the limit really. Reality is so weird, you know? The mind—and especially the mindset of seeing oneself as sick—plays a powerful, powerful role in the severity of disease. Best of luck to your CF people...it’s tough out there but we are not powerless in this fight.</p>

        <p>I went on AFLDS and had a telehealth call with a doctor who then prescribed It to me via a mail pharmacy. All very legit and quick!
This comment may be taken off, I’ve tried before, and I’ll keep trying!
Take at least 5000iu of vitamin D daily, plus zinc and vitamin C as well!</p>

        <p>Except the problem is that numerous BODYBUILDERS and BALLERINAS who were in the best shape of their lives got seriously sick while people who would be referred to as 'land whales' in popular parlance did not even know they had CoVid until they tested positive on an antibody test.</p>
<p>So doing all that stuff is not the 'be-all, end-all' you try to make it out to be with this disease. Personally I think it depends on your genetics whether CoVid seriously sickens or kills you more than anything else.</p>
<p>Sure being healthy in general helps a whole lot... but CoVid is a damned chaotic disease that you can be healthy as a horse and it will decide to kill you.</p>

        <p>It’s a matter of risk vs reward. As we know, the majority of people with serious complications from COVID are elderly or have comorbid conditions, like diabetes, obesity, and heart problems. </p>
<p>Take care of your body, boost  you immune system, understand the role that fear and stress plays in immunity,  and you’ll <em>drastically</em> decrease the likelihood of ever getting sick. What you’ve mentioned are the exceptions to that generality.</p>
