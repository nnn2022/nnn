    <strong>Flat Earth=Strawman</strong>
    <p><p>For all you flat earth believers l out there (I doubt there’s many in this sub but that’s irrelevant), what’s the point? I don’t really care how ridiculous or not ridiculous or mainstream or contrarian it is, how does it change our lives? “The government is lying to us”. No duh. The government lies to us about a lot of stuff but if they’re somehow lying about the shape of the earth, how does it change our lives? Spoiler: it doesn’t. Same thing goes for the reptilian/satanic beliefs about the government. “They’re evil” is the point of those ideas, but we already know that. (Honestly though the satanic stuff about the government seems most plausible but once again it’s not very relevant). In other words,  the problem with these theories is that they’re entirely irrelevant. We already know the government lies to us and is evil. We already know there is pedophilia going on with government officials, bringing in satanic reptiles on top of that doesn’t change anything. </p>
<p>So why are these theories prevalent among the “truther” communities. I suspect them to be government sponsored in part, encouraged so that NPCs can use them as strawman attacks against us. Qanon is a perfect example of that, in fact it’s all rolled together to make us look ridiculous through associating any government dissident as a Q cult member. On the other hand, believing Covid is a fraud due to the evidence we have, would change every aspect of our lives, which is why it actually means anything. The main message I send here is, is that the strawman theories are irrelevant. I personally consider aspects of them ridiculous but that’s not the important thing, the most important thing is that they’re entirely irrelevant. Feel free to believe or not believe them because it honestly doesn’t matter. Let’s focus on the real issues here, if NASA faked the moon landing or not it doesn’t change our lives. I kind of get that most of you don’t believe or care about these theories but we’ve all been targets of strawmans from them so I thought I should address this. The response shouldn’t simply be that the theory is ridiculous, but that the theory is irrelevant.</p></p>

        <p>They don't try to censor flat earth bullshit. But the legitimate conspiracies and suspicious things government do is quickly swept under 
the rug.</p>
<p>That should tell you enough.</p>
<p>Flat earthers are useful idiots to discredit skeptics.</p>

<p>As long as you don't believe in his enemy, it doesn't matter to him. It also doesn't matter to him what you think about the shape of the earth. As long as you stay away from his enemy. he knows his power in this world is short.</p>

        <p>I have class in a bit. I don't necessarily believe the earth is flat but would be happy to explain some from the PoV of flat earthers as I've been adjacent to and familiar with the community for a long time (when I'm done w/ class).</p>

        <p>Yeah I get you don’t have time but don’t worry if you understand the meaning of my post. It doesn’t matter to me if flat earthers are right or wrong. So that’s why I don’t find substance in the argument because my life wouldn’t change, unlike these arguments which involve our autonomy which the Covid fraud brings up. I mean it could be a hobby to debate the shape of the earth but I don’t consider it relevant to what we’re focused on here, which is individual rights.</p>

        <p>there is a middle ground also - who knows what shape is the world when nasa has releases so fucking much doctored and suspect imagery. </p>
<p>i always say its much harder to creat and maintain a lie than tell the truth, thats why top notch modern CGI still has hallmarks of being man made, and why cheating spouses have a hard time recreating everying synchronous detail when theyre out there don drapin’ around.   </p>
<p>i agree - flat earth is beyond the pale, but i dont know, i feel like crits of nasa help defeat the cult of scientism that threatens to repeat the covid dynamic in various ways going forward.</p>
