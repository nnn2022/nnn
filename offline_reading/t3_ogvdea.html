    <strong>I Think I've Figure Out What Happened</strong>
    <p><p>I might be a little slow in figuring this out, but it all just hit me last night. I know what's going on. Here's what I think happened:</p>
<p>Fauci, some people in the WHO, and probably a lot of other high level officials and scientists have a problem. For decades we have been warning them against gain-of-function research. We have been saying that it's likely to cause more harm than good and we shouldn't do it, but they decided to do it anyways. They decided to fuck with viruses in a lab and what happened? Exactly what we told them was going to happen: one got out.</p>
<p>So now it's time for damage control. At first, if you remember back in December 2019, they tried to play it down. It wasn't a big deal, it was no worse than the flu, and it was going to go away quickly. </p>
<p>But that didn't happen. This bug turned out to be even more infectious and lethal than they anticipated so they started to panic. Even though 99% of people recover from COVID, these medical oligarchs don't want all that blood on their hands and they have no idea how it's going to mutate or what the long term side effects are. So they started ~~recommending~~ enforcing lockdowns, masks, and business closures to get the numbers down. With a normal, natural, bug that had a 99% recovery rate, we all know they wouldn't do any of this. But with this one they are desperate to minimize the damage because they know it's their fault.</p>
<p>"Shit! Lockdowns aren't working. Ok, what do we know that is the most effective thing against a pathogen? Vaccines!" </p>
<p>So it's 4th down and their hail mary play is mass vaccination, but there's still a problem. Inactivated virus vaccines are slow to manufacture and they're really not that effective. They're only about 50-60% in the case of the flu shot, for example, so that isn't going to work. They conclude they need to take another risk and they need to fast track a pioneering new gene therapy to do it.</p>
<p>Gene therapy is actually a very promising new technology, but it's not nearly ready for the public yet. None of it is approved and we don't know the long term side effects. But it's 4th down! They're out of options. Gene therapy promises to be 95% effective and if they can, somehow, sparing no expense to government budgets or civil liberties, get a shot in every arm then there's a chance they can eradicate this virus before it gets too bad and people start looking too deeply at them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for them, their hail mary play isn't going well. These vaccines have way worse side effects than they predicted and significant parts of the population aren't as into risk taking as they are. All of that is pretty meaningless though since the virus is mutating far too fast for any vaccine to be effective. They're going to continue to desperately try to force us to take these vaccines, perhaps so they can blame the mutations on the people who didn't take it, but I think capitulation is around the corner.</p>
<p>They can't stop it. It's here now. They fucked with a virus in the lab, like idiots. It got out. To save <em>their</em> own asses, they destroyed entire economies, destroyed countless lives, and pushed experimental drugs on us, recklessly. That didn't work either. Coronavirus is here to stay and now it's time to shift focus. We need to find and put the people in jail who caused this mess and who destroyed the world in trying to cover it up.</p></p>

        <p>I find your post pretty accurate.</p>
<p>Fauci's line of defence will is: 'it does not matter if the virus escaped from a lab or originated in nature, we need to deal with the consequences regardless'. As you can notice, this is a line of defence of a guilty person. 'It does not matter if that person died of natural causes or was murdered, they are dead anyways'. Who says stuff like that? Guilty people. Other people value truth.</p>

        <p>Ya it all sort of hit me like a lightning bolt. In the above context, all of this weird shit makes sense.</p>
<p>1) Why lockdowns for something that isn't really that bad? Damage control. Some very important people really fucked up and they're panicking.</p>
<p>2) Why recklessly push experimental gene therapy that we have very little data on? More panic. Recent work on these gene therapies really is promising and they've concluded it's a risk worth taking. After all, their real concern is covering their <em>own</em> asses, and if they do nothing they're dead anyways. So it's a risk they definitely feel justified in taking, at our expense.</p>
<p>3) Why the continual fear mongering and exaggerating the dangers? So we'll let them do what they need to do to fix it. If they didn't terrify everyone, we wouldn't let them lock us down or push experimental vaccines. Furthermore, they need to be in complete control so free people don't start digging and figure out what they did.</p>
<p>I think pretty soon we're going to see a shift to blaming. None of this is working so they're going to blame "anti-vaxxers", Donald Trump, and whoever else they can think of. It's not going to work though. 2022, or maybe 2023-24 (probably depending a lot on US midterms) might be when people start going to jail.</p>

        <p>Don’t see how they can blame Trump for “anti Vax” sentiment since it was Trump that cleared the way for the Vax to begin with (and he was one of the first to get it)</p>

        <p>While I’d love to have Nuremberg style hangings before or after a mass depopulation event, and total destruction of the big pharma-big tech-big bureaucracy oligarchical juggernaut, and frequently feel sad that maybe Bill Gates and others actually are trying to get us to &lt;=500M total population, Occam’s razor suggests that this is the most likely explanation of what actually happened. They should all still hang for what they’ve done but at least we don’t need a nuclear war with China….yet</p>

        <p>Your theory makes a lot of sense. However, it doesn’t explain why they would ban treatments like hydroxycloroquine or ivermectin.</p>
<p>Also, if this theory is correct, their initial reactiin of, “it’s fine, it’ll go away quickly” would have worked except the media managed to exaggerate everything and cause mass global panics 😂</p>
