        <p>Yes, it is unfortunate the bias in technological companies. </p>
<p>In a rational species, it would be best for people with opposing views to discuss them out in a public space for all to ponder, inquire, and debate. If no mutual agreements can be made in full, then comprises must be made for the benefit of both sides. </p>
<p>Rational tells us from history that no single person can be changed or ‚Äúconverted‚Äù on the spot. I‚Äôve witnessed this myself as seeds of truth I planted among people took fruition over a year later. At the time I didn‚Äôt know it would, but now I know it can. </p>
<p>In this climate, for example we can say the average person has been conditioned to accept covid-new-normal for over 1 year and a half. The ignorance that has been stewed in their mind may be another byproduct years in the making. No man nor even god can undo this overnight. Do not expect to. Just keep being persistent, friendly, and sometimes firm. Stand up for what you know, and do not waiver, do not eschew what you know to any source entirely, nor to any one icon. Icons and sources can be compromised. Be the truth sayer confidently, descriptively, and earnestly. </p>
<p>Speak not from reciting but from personal passion fuelled by your knowledge. </p>
<p>That‚Äôs my advice. </p>
<p>They are going continue to oppress us, the ones willing to speak against the progressing regime. We need to do better. We need to also find the  lizard people conspiracy nuts and yeet them out of our circle because they give us a bad name üòÇ</p>

        <p>It really makes you wonder lol.</p>
<p>The claim is ‚Äúwe spread misinformation and lead to people dying because they don‚Äôt take the shot‚Äù </p>
<p>So what that narrative tells us, what government, social media, news outlets are literally admitting, is they know, and are calling you and everyone else a moron who will believe anything they hear. If their ‚Äúsafe space‚Äù of 300,000 people can be swayed by what we have to say, does that mean they are all idiots, or does it mean there‚Äôs a level of truth to what we are saying that seems rational and worth considering? There‚Äôs no middle ground here, it‚Äôs either:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>everyone‚Äôs an idiot and will believe anything they are told so we have to censor everything to protect them from their own stupidity, which in turns means that the same stupid people who are listening to what the government and media is saying, are listening blindly, and thus that leaves open the probability that what is being told to everyone by mainstream narratives can also be a lie, because they‚Äôve already admitted to saying everyone is dumb, so they too can be lying because we‚Äôre all just dumb and will believe anything right?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or option two: what the non-conformists are saying, while not always 100% accurate, is worth considering because there is reasonable intent behind it, and nobody in power wants anyone to consider an alternative to their regime. They don‚Äôt want even the idiots to second guess the new normal because then their power wanes and they lose total dominance over us. Second guessing what you‚Äôre being told is a corner stone of what freedom is all about, or more specifically having the right to second guess what you‚Äôre being told.</p>
</li>
