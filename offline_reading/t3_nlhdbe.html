    <strong>Credible sources for the lab theory?</strong>
    <p><p>I've had my suspicions for almost a year now that the whole "china guy ate a bat" story was bullshit. Now the theory that the virus came from an experimental lab in Wuhan is becoming increasingly more talked about. </p>
<p>Can anyone cite credible sources for this claim so I can convince my friends and family? Perhaps the hearings with Fauci and others. </p>
<p>People are so invested and doubled down in their rationalization that I'm going to need something rock solid and undeniable to convince them... Thank you for helping out</p></p>

        <p>There is no one source that 'proves' this, but if you spend a bunch of time on EthicalSkeptic twitter, he has a lot of graphs, studies, links to information about the genetic derivation and mutation rate of the sampled strains.  Everyone wants to see "the smoking gun" but it just doesn't work that way, even if the media portrays it such.</p>
<p>edit: the gist of one line of thinking is that there were FAR too many identified strains as of ~nov 2019, given the mutation rate of these viruses, for this to be a single cross-species jump, and instead was replicating and mutating for months prior to public awareness, which could only be either in a lab, or spreading through the community for an extra year...which given asian excess mortality for the 2018-2019 season may in fact also be the case.  The lab procedures were very poor and other leaks are absolutely likely.</p>

        <p>It doesn't matter how credible your source is. You won't convince your friends and family once  they've made up their minds.</p>
