    <p><p>That being said, don’t come here to be a dick or to lash out or gaslight ‘the far left’ or ‘anti anti-vaxxers’. Let’s just have discussions about topics were all wondering about. That’s what’s great about Reddit we can all see one thing and tweak it collectively if need be. </p>
<p>My position? </p>
<p>The more I think, the more this vaccine is giving me the heebie jeebies. Just the amount of pressure and pushing going on is making my inner Winston Smith (Orwell’s 1984 reference) come out. Why is everyone being so pushy! Why is there so much <em>group think</em> </p>
<p>I came here to see if I could find the thoughts and the links to the sources of those thoughts. Things like relative death statistics and infection/survival rates. Things like real first hand stories and experiences. The doctors who are willing to put their rep on the line to speak out and say what they believe in - without being silenced or outcasted. I figured this would be a great place for that. </p>
<p>I have questions and inquiry. I wonder what we’re being told. I don’t and have never subscribed to MSM and in times like this I can only amplify that belief. </p>
<p>So you won’t find me lurking and giving shit to people who don’t think like me. Or trying to convince anybody ‘this is the way’. I’m just going to be looking to find the unfiltered and untainted data/headlines so I can make a decision for myself. It seems that we are in very fragile times where lots of people are looking for a way out and <em>big brother</em> is extending and olive branch. I cannot for the life of me reach out and grab that branch being the thinker I am. These vaccines are emergency approved not fully approved. Didn’t some get recalled? Havent people died from complications with these shots? Want me to just ‘roll up my sleeve’ I think it was for the Swine Flu Vax? I thought this was a glorified cold/flu and if you’re young and healthy you’re good. What happened to that narrative?</p>
<p>I mean I’m not opposed to getting vaccinated for malaria and hepatitis if I go travelling or whatever. Proven nasty viruses, fully approved remedies. This Covid looks bad on the news and through socials. But you won’t even let me wait until we get the FULL FDA approval before I make my call? I personally know ONE (1) person in my city who has had Covid. He’s alive and well, tee time next Saturday. (Not saying that’s the only person with corona in my city I’m saying PERSONALLY in my own day to day life that’s been effected). So, Why is it so urgent? Because grandma? Because your favourite source of info? Because it’s the right thing? Because you’ve done the research? Because collectively you’ve found like minded folks and you’re the majority? Because THEY’RE DOCTORS? (seen that one thrown around a lot). Because you need to drink mimosas with your friends on Saturday’s? Because you want it to be over? Because you need it to be over? Because you’re scared? Is that what it boils down to? </p>
<p>I’m pretty new to Reddit and really got active for the GameStop movement. If that movement has taught me anything aside from trading strategies and analysis, it’s THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA is a weapon. It is owned and operated with intent. With an agenda. It is used by players who want to control and that is a belief I will not back down on. </p>
<p>So I’m about out of steam now. Wasn’t planning on outing myself as an anti-vaxxer and I still don’t think I am. I’d prefer anti-submitter, anti-mushbrain, <strong>anti-groupthink</strong>. </p>
<p>All in all, I’ve voiced my opinion and am ready to see what the response will be. </p>
<p>Take care.</p>
<p><strong>edit</strong> </p>
<p>Turns out I am going to give some shit to people who don’t think like me, but in moderation. Like all things. I’m only human 🤷🏼‍♂️</p></p>

        <p>Likewise. I'm currently freezing my eggs (I'm in my 30s and still single), and I'm amazed how many women are getting vaccinated while freezing and/or doing IVF. I got banned from a sub saying it's probably not smart getting vaccinated when there are no studies on birth defects and child development due to it being a new vaccine.</p>

        <p>Hey welcome, also /r/lockdownskepticism is more curated and less memes (focused on current events and research) </p>
<p>I think of masks like a cloth hoodie, they don’t work but for the lightest of rains - eventually you get wet anyways though...</p>
<p>There’s lots of research showing that their efficacy is easily erased by things as simple as allowing in person dining — and all the research suggests ventilation is much more effective than masks</p>
<p>If you want I can link some of this research when I’m at my computer - best part most of these papers I don’t even have to do the research to find - they’re usually sent to me by people trying to send me “gotcha” research papers, I just bother to read them, and their cited works — that’s right my most damning papers against masks that I have were sent to me “proving” masks work... lol</p>

        <p>There are several red flags for me going on around this vaccine. The lack of testing of the vaccine, lack of accountability, covering up adverse reactions, censorship, lies, manipulation of facts/information, bullying, the propaganda like news repeating the same things over and over, the weirdest I think is how they’re trying to bribe the public into getting this shot with all sorts of free stuff. </p>
<p>I’ve already had reactions to tested vaccines before, there is no way I want to get another, let alone a untested new vaccine. Someone I know just got the shot, then got COVID (second person I know this happened to) and is now in a medically induced coma and on a ventilator. Another got boils up the whole side of her body that are so bad now she has to get them drained and now I think she’s having other problems and can’t even work.</p>

        <p>I’m actually happy I went to lunch with some of my coworkers (including my boss) and they all understood my stances and respected them. Though they’re all vaccinated, they recognize the importance of a person having a right over what they do about their health.</p>
