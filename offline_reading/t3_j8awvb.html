        <p>Imagine thinking that everybody wearing masks would just make the pandemic magically "go away".</p>
<p>Also, it's not true that we are "still in this shitshow" because not everybody is wearing masks: masks ARE the shitshow, or at least a major character-actor in the shitshow. Social distancing, lockdowns, contact tracing, masks—all the apparatus of the COVID police state—those are the individual elements that people are referring to when they talk of the "shitshow" of COVID. So, to suggest that the sooner everyone is on board with the shitshow (wearing masks) the sooner the shitshow ends (not having to wear masks)… is just insanity!</p>
<p>Also,
&rt; [implying they weren't going to try to make us all wear masks regardless of how the virus was going]</p>
<p>The virus could disappear off the face of the earth tomorrow, and they still wouldn't give up on all this. They'll keep this thing going for as long as they want to. The whole structure is already in place, they don't even need the virus to be real anymore.</p>

        <p>Yes. They're riding this train to the last station.</p>
<p>There's billions to be made.</p>
<p>They've seen how meekly most people will give up their freedoms.</p>
<p>They're buying billions of dollars of tech "to fight COVID" and investing in contact tracing, face recognition, temp scanners, drones, etc etc. All of this stuff is easy to "re-purpose" into the machinery of a social-credit based police state. They certainly aren't going to just send it to the scrapyard!</p>

        <p>I know this bozo IRL. He's 30 years old and lives with his parents. He wants to move to China because he thinks he'll get poon tang and that the government can make better decisions than he can about his home, family, healthcare, leisure, and work. </p>
<p>Ironically, he just got back from Sweden, where they didn't close restaurants or schools or wear masks, but he thinks America is a melting pot of death because of poor government response and Trumptard covidiots. Yet, as he virtue signals online about being a woke socialist who follows all the rules, he goes out and parties and sees "friends" regularly. He's never had a real job and won't ever find one in his field of study (anthropology).</p>

        <p>Interesting. I'm sure someone posted that same screed almost verbatim on here in the last day or so. </p>
<p>As for China, it's well known (at least among those of us that care to know) that Chinese astroturfers on social media used their influence to encourage Western governments to enact lockdowns and mask mandates, starting in Italy.</p>
<p>Considering how much the Chinese will benefit from us committing economic hari-kari, I doubt it's just a coincidence.</p>
