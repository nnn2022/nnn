<title>These comparisons to polio are a joke. The risk-benefit analysis is not the same. 100% chance of being paralyzed vs. 99%+ chance of surviving a respiratory infection. Saying that normal people living their lives are “forfeiting” rights is Orwellian BS. They’re being stripped of their rights.</title>

        <p>I’m still waiting for an answer as to why.   If a person is vaccinated, it’s been said they have like a 99.999 chance of surviving the virus.  If vaccinated people wear a mask it “stops the spread”. So if you litterally can’t die, and your literally “stopping the spread”. Why is there so much pressure on other to become vaccinated? Don’t give me this variant bullshit. Because covid was around for a year without vaccination and then after people started to become vaccination did these variants start popping up.  Just like the Flu.

        <p>Don't you understand that there are a couple people in your city who have immune systems so fucked up that they cant get the vaccine. They have faced a serious risk of death from catching the flu their entire life but this is different somehow. It is selfish to not agree that the entire world should cater to this fringe group of people instead of them taking responsibility for their medical conditions and taking appropriate precautions in their life.</p>

        <p>Yeah, not enough people in here have realized that they have been using the same playbook for centuries now. It's just super obvious now and for the time being we still have the tools to spread awareness much more effectively than they did in the 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>

<p>I should point out that the idea that polio is a dangerous disease is a lie. The rushed polio vaxx resulted in 93M+ people getting jabbed with a concoction that contained an oncogenic simian virus, SV40 contamination, whose effects are likely responsible for the cancer scourge in the US.</p>

        <p>polio was just renamed after the polio vaccine came out (to Guillain Barre and Transverse Myelitis) in order to make it look like the vaccine was effective at ridding polio.  But all they did is rename it.  If "polio," as a term is never used again in regards to diagnosis, then it's easy to see how the vaccine could take credit for banishing it.   And the truth is, looking back, we don't even know that the people who had "polio" back in the early part of the past century actually had the wild virus or a case of Guillain Barre/transverse myelitis, neither of which could the vaccine prevent.  President Roosevelt didn't actually have the wild virus of polio, but rather Guillain Barre, which again, the vaccine wouldn't have helped.  No telling how many other so-called polio sufferers from that era were in the same boat.   Today there are less than a couple dozen cases of wild polio in the whole world...and you know not all of the billions of people on the planet got the polio vaccine....</p>

        <p>Exactly. The underlying dispute between people isn't really about public health measures like vaccines, lockdowns, masks, and so on. Rather it is a perception as to how bad this pandemic is as a public health crisis. (A) There are those who think the pandemic is nothing to get worked up about and that much of the reaction to the pandemic has been an overreaction at best and an attempt to undermine human freedom at worst. (B) On the other side are those who think the pandemic is a human health disaster and that every measure no matter how extreme must be taken to save lives.  </p>
<p>Sadly, it has become increasingly difficult for those two sides to have any conversation with one another and the result is what we see in Sydney: repression---&rt;riots---more repression---more riots and on.</p>

        <p>I believe the discussion have not happened because one side refuses to change from the fear mongering narrative setup by the “powers that be”. Science is great when used properly.  But just pooling a couple “experts” that agree with your narrative and taking only data that supports your narrative is a dangerous thing.  That’s why people are rioting. Information is being suppressed.</p>
