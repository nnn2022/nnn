    <strong>The Build Back Better Infrastructure Plan.</strong>
    <p><p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is all 100% the United Nations. </p>
<p>If one has been paying attention, one would know they've been telling us their plan for years. Its just that now, it's really being pushed in the US through Biden...and I say "through Biden," because that's the only reason why he is President..to push the Agenda. They are able to implement it because the majority of the people either don't care or don't do their own research and go with the crowd which is usually miss informed.</p>
<p>People think it's not real, it a "conspiracy theory". What they don't understand is their local officials in their city have already been voting and working towards it. In many countries like the Netherlands, Switzerland, France, its already the way of life. Don't believe me? Google Earth these places and tell me its not exactly what they are planning in this Infrastructure Plan. No cars or car lanes, people are to ride bikes and buses everywhere. So the car lanes are changed to bike and bus lanes. This "Infrastructure Plan" has been in the making for years. Every major city has a "Regional Plan" which is/has been the framework for carrying out this Agenda. I live in Saint Louis, here is one of the frameworks for the Agenda.</p>

People need to start caring.. they have no clue what the world will be like for their kids/grandkids and future generations.</p></p>

        <p>Another tactic they've been using to accomplish their agenda is using regulations. It's not near as difficult for them to pass regulations compared to voting a law into effect especially some of their crazy schemes and many of these go undiscovered. There's politicians on both sides that are pushing ridiculous agendas but it's mostly coming from the left side, agenda 21 being the most concerning. We can expect to see global warming used as a leverage tool by the left and this is really sad because they could care less about the environment and by them using it as a tool that's exactly how people will view it, when in reality we do need to move in the direction of more environmental friendly ways but these clowns don't need a say in the matter.</p>
