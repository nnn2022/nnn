    <strong>More Psy-Op info to consider from Red Bull 3-15-22-9-4-AI related</strong>

<p>TL;DR no worries, I just wanted to cite a source. Red Bull would put their empty cans into trash bins so people thought the product was more popular, and then people felt they were missing out.</p>
<p>Now, 70% of the country is vaccinated? Only according to the same media telling you it is safe and 1,000,000% effective... One shot or both? Funny how they can twist things on a one way platform... </p>
<p>This is all a giant Psy-Op, the only real question is the motive, then we can figure an end game. Division was complete, dehumanization was next anyway. Genocide and denial are all that is left on the 10 steps of genocide. Are we watching them both in real time?  </p>
<p>It says shower over the door, what are you? Anti shower? Get in there, Gypsy filth. Stop asking questions before I get hostile and wish death upon your bloodline for being collectively dirtier than me.</p></p>
