    <strong>FUCK r/nfl!</strong>
    <p><p>In the past few days, over half of the posts on that sub have pertained to the reporting of who has been vaccinated, what percentage of each team has been, and more importantly (to the majority on that sub) who has been "outed" as not having been vaccinated.</p>
<p>Users on that sub mostly all have their favorite team's logo as their flair, and people with every type of flair have just been tee'ing off on anyone who hasn't gotten the shots yet. Cole Beasley has emerged as the main scapegoat after he posted how he felt about the NFL's new policy regarding the shots, which basically makes it as difficult as possible for those players who do not want to get the shots...</p>
<p>This morning though, mods decide to lock comments on any of the posts regarding getting the shots, because "we have had issues with "antivaxxers" in these posts" even though 99% of the comments are talking shit ABOUT "antivaxxers". Anyone who doesn't have some kind of "witty" comment or retort or maybe questions why this is so relevant gets downvoted into the -100's.</p>
<p>In past years, this is the time of year when teams are amping up for the beginning of the season, when we hear about new potential players who could contribute or get good sound bites. It fucking sucks that this sub has devolved into a bunch of propaganda pushing and internet pitch-forking when it is the main sub for the United States' premier professional sports league...</p></p>

        <p>Unfortunately no matter the subject, redditors seem to literally ruin everything. I'm starting to think the upvote system is the root of the problem but obviously it goes hand in hand with people who religiously use reddit and browse big or default subs.</p>

        <p>The reason places like /nfl are like this is they have shill mods who permaban the smallest amount of resistance.  Then astroturf it with bots or some poor people in South Africa getting paid in doge to shitpost.  To make it look like you're an outsider and everyone disagrees with you.  </p>
<p>Little do they know is this strict level of censorship has the Streisand Effect.  In the sense that, say you're someone that is generally scared of covid.  But then you make a small harmless question against the narrative.  And you get permabanned. You think WTF?  And then you start seeking places like nonewnormal and it starts spiraling.</p>

        <p>I feel like most stuff there is the whole Peter Griffin's "OH MY GOD. Who. The hell. Caaress." material.</p>
<p>Honestly, it's "that part" of the offseason where fans and media are making stories out of things that shouldn't be. Even then, there seems to be a ton more this year than usual. This coming from someone who loves the NFL, and enjoys knowing of every transaction and a little analysis of it.</p>
<p>It's funny though, the vaccine is widely available (especially to professional athletes, I'd imagine), but I heard a few days ago that only around half the players (possibly coaches too) have gotten a first dose. And pretty big-name players have came out and openly said that they don't want to get the vaccine at the moment. Yet of all players to go after </p>
<p>Like I saw a tweet posted here a few days ago of some psycho blue checkmark going after Sam Darnold, of ALL people, saying he should be suspended without pay until he gets the vaccine.</p>
<p>I'll also add that a few months ago I was permabanned from NFL for commenting on a post about the WTFs hiring a women as their assistant RBs coach or something. I just said "Oh hey, another first, second, third <em>x</em> hire." and repeated that Peter Griffin line. I very politely asked why I was permabanned, and explained why I shouldn't be. I was accused of trolling, and explained that it wasn't trolling, and even if it was, it didn't constitute a permaban. The response was: "If you weren't trolling, then you are just misogynistic and we don't want you in our community."</p>
<p>I've also heard about NFL permabanning a bunch of people for silly reasons. Just like many other large subs, it's really becoming a toxic ass circlejerk of people who don't actually represent the general populous.</p>
