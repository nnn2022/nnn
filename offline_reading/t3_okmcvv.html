        <p>Just look at the numbers. Should we even care as a community about them ? They are 5K, we are over 90k and growing every day. Leave them alone in their world where their masters will decide how much bug per day they'll be able to eat.</p>

        <p>I kinda think this sub is being left alone on purpose.</p>
<p>They use it to identify the users that are willing to speak up and ban them preemptively from other subs.</p>
<p>So everything we have to say stays in our bubble while outside of it it seems no-one deviates from the official narrative. I think a lot of people besides us feel that something is wrong. But due to them not seeing others to speak out, they may think they are the only ones feeling like that.</p>

        <p>Some remarkable things about the goose-steppers are:</p>
<p>1) they're very unintelligent</p>
<p>2) they really do have a hive mind, where all of them "think" the same things and drool the same lines/lies.  One part of that is that the goose-step narrative is a house of cards.  If you realize that one thing is wrong about it, it all comes crashing down.</p>
<p>Because they're unintelligent, they pretty much can only think of other people in terms of themselves.</p>
<p>Because THEY are hive-minded, they can only think of us as being hive-minded.  Look at how often their posts and comments use collective terms like "they".</p>
<p>Any individual that posts here is ... well, ONE individual.  No individual is the spokesperson for all the rest is us, and no single post defines the rest of us.</p>
<p>There are quite a lot of differing views on a lot of things around here.</p>
<p>It'd be fairly hard to pin down an accurate statement about what exactly all of us agree on.  Maybe it would have to be very basic like: the response to this virus is overblown.  Of course there's a few terrain theory extremists around that think viruses don't even exist, so probably that statement isn't accurate.</p>
<p>Yet the goose-steppers consistently say things like "look what <em>they</em> believe" or "look what misinformation <em>they</em> are spreading" or whatever.</p>
<p>It's true the video in the original post also was on a tweet from 2018!  That video did <em>not</em> occur the day prior. Although another comment here shows that protests <em>did</em> occur, just not that video.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean any of us others are saying or promoting it did, and only several people have an ability to control that that misinformation is removed, or to choose to permit it to stay, such as for purposes of discussion.  Even then, a choice to permit it to stay doesn't mean ANY of us "believe" it.</p>
<p>Holding the actions of one person against a loosely affiliated group is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_punishment">"collective punishment"</a></p>
<p>Collective punishment is a human rights violation.</p>
<p>Apparently only their made-up "right" for them to hold <em>you&amp; responsible for _their</em> poor health choices is the only human "right" they respect ??</p>

        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_punishment"><strong>Collective punishment</strong></a></p>
<p>Collective punishment is a form of retaliation whereby a suspected perpetrator's family members, friends, acquaintances, sect, class, political affiliation, neighbors or entire ethnic group is targeted. The punished group may often have no direct association with the other individuals or groups, or direct control over their actions. In times of war and armed conflict, collective punishment has resulted in atrocities, and is a violation of the laws of war and the Geneva Conventions.</p>
