        <p>As a nurse myself.  A lot of nurses have already had the Kung Flu (myself included) so to us getting a vaccine for something we already have natural immunity to seems superfluous.</p>

        <p>Nurse here.  I literally walk in and out of covid rooms on a regular basis.  I got the kung-flu one time and was over it fast.  I take Vit D and Zinc daily.  I'm not getting vaccinated.</p>
<p>I'm not afraid of this bullshit at all.  I'm not an "asymptomatic carrier" or any other fear-mongering bullshit.  Masks do not work.</p>
<p>What I see in the hospital is that whatever it is we are doing for these patients is absolutely <strong>not working.</strong>  Yes, it's true that younger people do die from this disease.  People in their 50's who should not be dealing with this.  It's heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Everyone of them is getting Remdesivir and it doesn't seem to do jack-shit.  They just get worse.  None of them get Ivermectin or Hydroxychloriquine.  I couldn't tell you why. You would think if people were literally dying from this virus then maybe WE SHOULD FUCKING TRY IT!</p>
<p>Ivermectin and Hydroxychloriquine cost pennies on the dollar while Remdesivir is $3,000 per dose.  Maybe that's got something to do with it or maybe I'm just a conspiracy theorist.  Who knows?? </p>
<p>It's fucking infuriating what's taking place and I'm honestly embarrased of my profession on a regular basis now.</p>

        <p>Same here everyone gets the $3,000 a pop "miracle drug" remdesevir.  Im probably too cold and calloused but when i see the people that are sick with this disease.   Its not healthy people.  These are people that probably would have wound up in the hospital at some point in the next 6 months anyways.  My old man is 72 in pretty good health.  (Just on a BP and cholesterol med) and he kicked the Wuhan Flu in 36hrs.</p>

        <p>As an attorney, the red flag went off when I heard the companies were immune. Still, I was going to get the vaccine until two otherwise healthy family members had adverse cardiac reactions which resulted in one dying within two weeks and the other almost getting needless bypass surgery. Doubt these were reported.</p>

        <p>I left the nursing sub for this reason. Some nurses think it‚Äôs selfish and unethical that other nurses, HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS, don‚Äôt want the shot. I‚Äôm like, what‚Äôs wrong with questioning it? Healthcare professionals should be the first in line to question anything in the healthcare industry. But I guess they‚Äôre just taught in school to just blindly follow. Makes me sad. I want to be a doctor so bad but with all that‚Äôs going on, I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll even be able to because of all the bullshit they‚Äôre putting healthcare professionals through now</p>
