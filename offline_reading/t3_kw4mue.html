    <strong>Where did the narrative ''if we locked down hard enough the pandemic would have been over'' came from?</strong>
    <p><p>Like how does that make any logical sense, first of all for this to even theoretically work every person on the planet would have to stay home and not go out for litteraly anything, do you see the issue a plan that requires 99% compliance just won't work</p>
<p>Also how would it be over the virus wouldn't be eliminated so cases will just rise again when we open up anyways, the only virus that was eliminated was smallpox and it took forever to do so, do some people legitimately think that we can somehow eliminate COVID, I am sorry but none of this makes any sense.</p>
<p>Let's just end this whole charace, and no I don't think I am selfish for suggesting that, the actual selfish ones are those who think that we can continue living like this until 2023 or something, we can't just cower in fear forever, viruses have always and will always exist and that shouldn't stop us from living.</p>
<p>When the COVID pandemic is over, what if another virus appear and then another one, do the doomers suggest we stay locked forever, see how ridiculous this all feels, it's because it actually is and if the doomesr actually used their critical thinking for a second instead of just calling us ''selfish'' then maybe they would have realized how ridiculous this whole thing is.</p></p>
