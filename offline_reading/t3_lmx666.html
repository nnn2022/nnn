        <p>No it doesn't. I'm pro vax, but the Covid vaccine has been rushed to market and is unsafe. No medical professional will say vaccines are completely safe, just that the risks are very low, which is true. The Covid vaccines has far higher than expected risks.</p>

        <p>Checking out your links the majority of them say things directly like, for example from your NYTimes one, "we don‚Äôt believe at this time that there is any direct connection to the vaccine.‚Äù From your GeekCityTimes one (the headline in fact): "doctors suspect no link to jab". Hardly proof of it being unsafe--but of course, in a conspiracy sub like this, your answer will be "but the doctors are obviously lying!!! I know better than the doctors that actually investigated these cases!!!". Sigh. In fact, the evidence says the vaccine is perfectly safe:  </p>

        <p>Who is "they" and how many people are in on this conspiracy? It's not just the pharmaceutical companies themselves or government agencies themselves that would have to lie but also local doctors, nurses, etc. that would have to shut up and censor themselves.  </p>
<p>Anyway, the evidence right now is that no deaths have been linked to the vaccine, soooooo yeah that's what I'm going with rather than baseless speculation.</p>

        <p>Just because you know what I'm going to say doesn't make it wrong. Then why don't you tell me why the Covid vaccines has so many deaths very shortly after it being administrated? Someone getting the vaccine and dying minutes later is just a coincidence? Big pharma is one of the least honest industries on earth. You just like them because they agree with you now.</p>

        <p>&rt; tell me why the Covid vaccines has so many deaths very shortly after it being administrated?</p>
<p>"so many"--sorry, I've gotta reject that baseless, ridiculous claim. there's a SMALL handful of outliers with millions of doses being administered, in fact millions administered per day, and all you can do is scrounge up a handful of articles where the doctors find no connection to the vaccine. And most of your examples are not minutes later but days or even weeks later--perfectly reasonable for one out of tens of millions of people to experience a stroke or heart attack in that time frame. Real compelling.  </p>

        <p>People don't appreciate the destructive force of a hurricane because they look at barometric charts or studies on wind speed - they see pictures of flattened buildings and submerged street signs.</p>
<p>I wish people would apply this logic to covid. I don't want to see one more stat, graph, or study - if this virus has truly ravaged the US for the past year, there should be hundreds (if not thousands) of videos of anguished families losing loved ones in the streets because the hospital is overflowing. I have yet to see a single one.</p>

<p>There  is no way there wasn't community spread before (well before?) Dec 2019.  Because the odds that those donors were also people who'd recently been to Wuhan and picked it up there? Ridiculous.</p>

        <p>People were likely misdiagnosed with pneumonia or similar illnesses at first. I doubt there's much data available about that right now though. It'll be interesting to see when it's all a bit better.</p>

        <p>Part of the issue with showing videos and pictures of hospitals is the strict regulations that hospitals have put into place to protect them from lawsuit, and HIPAA . I‚Äôm not saying that it is a bad thing to have those regulations in place, I just wish that we had more to show the direct effects than just the facts and statistics. It does make everyone so removed from the concept that it is humans that are affected at the end of the day.</p>

        <p>I'm talking about videos of people dying in the streets.</p>
<p>Think about it: if someone's grandma or w/e was sick, and they brought them to the hospital, and the hospital said 'sorry, we literally have no room left', youd just have to watch your grandma die in the parking lot, right? Wouldn't people share those stories? Why aren't we hearing about thousands of them?</p>

        <p>I just found this sub, I wish I had a year ago.</p>
<p>My church has been closed for a year. They have service on Facebook, but watching the depressing attempt at what was once a beautiful ritual just rubs salt in the wound, I can't even get through it without crying. </p>
<p>My priest called to ask about where we were and I just told him we don't do online church because I want to protect my kids from screens. I don't think they're good for mental health. He basically told me too bad and I haven't heard from him since. I get the feeling if they ever do re-open I will be persona non Grata.</p>
<p>The school I work at where my son used to go has been all virtual with a few lame attempts at hybrid. Online teaching is draining my soul. I am literally chained to my computer all day talking to depressed 5 year olds and their parents who hate me for being lazy and collecting a check for "nothing". Online teaching is 5√ó the work for 1/5 the benefit. Admin is constantly surveying teachers about their "willingness" to teach in person and if they "feel safe" bit no one ever asked me if I was "willing" to teach online.</p>
<p>I decided to homeschool my son with Abeka to spare him frome being chained to a screen all day. He is still sad because of loneliness but at least he doesn't have deadlines and restrictions and is free to go outside and cope with loneliness in nature.</p>
<p>I actually deleted my Facebook because anytime I posted a picture of me and my family going anywhere or if friends were in our house my mom would flip out and yell at me.</p>
<p>I live 1000 miles from my mom and dad and I haven't seen them in over a year. My mom is obsessed with quarantining and "social distancing" and she knows I go to work, my kids go to dance etc. She did not allow me to visit for Thanksgiving or Christmas. </p>
<p>Before this I was fairly left leaning so most of my friends are not inclined to be sympathetic to my struggles as this kind of "whining" and people who think like me are virus spreaders and "murderers" nowadays.</p>
<p>I literally went from being regarded as a great teacher, well-liked, active episcopalian, and a good mom, to everyone thinking I'm an incompetant piece of crap. I have literally had to go on two strong psych meds for the first time in my life. I also tried therapy but the virtual appointment platform failed all the time and I got tired of paying "no show" fees.</p>
<p>I know this is the same stuff everyone is dealing with, but just having a place to state honestly how I feel is a brief moment of release. I'm really just screaming into the void but it does help sometimes.</p>

        <p>At the very least it‚Äôs clear to you now which people are truly ‚Äúgood people‚Äù, and which simply is bey government commands without any critical thinking. The church thing really resonated with me despite me being a Muslim it‚Äôs the same kind of thing. The online ‚Äúsubstitutes‚Äù sucks, they feel fake and inauthentic. It‚Äôs like at the end of the day these religious institutions worship the state as their god despite church and state supposed to be separated. I feel I‚Äôve become more opposed to religious dogma over this time but I‚Äôve held onto a strong belief in God. The true colors of those around us have been revealed, hopefully we can get back to normal through resistance, it will not come through obedience.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry to hear about your parents not even wanting you around for the holidays. That drives me crazy and makes my blood boil. Same with the church. I know you said Episcopal, but if you're looking for a beautiful service and ritual to attend in person, I would recommend the traditional Catholic Mass. The traditional parishes I've been to have in person services and don't even require masks. Just a suggestion I thought I'd throw out. Message me if you'd like more info. Hope you find some peace of mind!</p>

        <p>Even after the test is negative it takes a few weeks to have lung capacity you used to have. So it's a risk going out and running into dustallergens or airborne infections</p>

        <p>A viral infection never really leaves your body. Your lung capacity is compromised even after your swab test is negative. </p>
<p>You can check your SiO2 levels for data. Once it gets to 99% with a resting heart rate around 80 Bpm you should be able to resume regular activities. </p>
<p>If you haven't matched these numbers you run the risk of allergies being severe or vulnerability towards airborne infections such as bronchitis or pneumonia.</p>

        <p>I never claimed to say that. 
I said if you recovered from covid you still need to be careful because your body is still not at 100% </p>
<p>This is a blatant over simplification. But imagine your body as a car running on an ICE<br>
You need oxygen from your air intake via the air filter (Your lungs)  </p>
<p>Covid acts as hard debris which damages the lining of the air filter and allows bigger particles to get in the piston chamber (Your heart) 
These particles in an engine can wreak havoc if they are not cleaned thoroughly. And your air filter hasn't been repaired. </p>
<p>Once the virus has left the body it starts healing itself which might take a few days or weeks. </p>
<p>This is why even for people who have recovered it is advisable to be safe than sorry. 
You wouldn't drive your car without an air filter why do that to your body?</p>

        <p>It sort of appears that you are arguing against a point that I did not make, which would be that COVID has absolutely no effect on your body once you've initially recovered. The question I was posing to the person above was whether or not there was data to support the idea that an individual could contract the virus, recover and somehow spread the virus weeks or months later without contracting the virus again. </p>
<p>I hope it is clear why I'm confused by your response.</p>

        <p>absolutely, all the health insurance plan info too</p>
<p>edit: yeah they are definitely making a database and the card has 4 slots, first 2 say 1st dose covid-19 and 2nd dose covid , ***3rd and 4th slot say other, don't know if it was a space thing or if they just plan on having to do more shots, then product name/manufactures/Lot number, then date, then healthcare professional or clinic site, but before you get it there's a bunch of check ins where you sign crap and they take your id's and your health insurance. It felt like half DMV and half vaccination site</p>

        <p>You. Absolute. Twat. 
The irony. "Did they collect your personal information"</p>
<p>Mate you are using a device manufactured by a private company which has been proven to provide your government with your information. 
Using an application manufactured by either the networking site that has backdoors which sold to intelligence agencies since 2007. </p>
<p>Or the biggest database in human history. Again which is sponsored by selling your information. </p>
<p>But somehow a vaccine registration is personal information. Where is the uproar over that? 
There is concrete proof. The Patriot Act. Snowden. </p>
<p>Why don't you start there instead of a ducking vaccine. All the information you give out for this vaccine is already in the database of you ever opened a bank account or owned a drivers license.</p>

        <p>Honestly, I think most people here will hate me, but whatever.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been a proponent of masks since April of last year. Disagreed with lockdowns, would‚Äôve preferred mask mandates and capacity adjustments. Overall, I feel like I‚Äôve been to the left of many conservatives who were skeptical of the lockdowns, and to the right of most libs who never want to get out of them. But I‚Äôve still thought wearing masks and getting the vaccine were the best ways to get out of this pandemic.</p>
<p>But now? Fuck this shit about ‚Äúoh once you get the vaccine you still have to socially distance‚Äù. No. Fucking no. It stamps out serious aspects of the disease and is 90% effective against spreading it. Wtf is with all this ‚Äúwe still need to stay locked down even when most people get vaccinated‚Äù that I‚Äôve been seeing from media people and journalists?</p>
<p>Are you fucking insane? I feel betrayed, because I fucking listened to these dipshits. My college didn‚Äôt have in person graduation so we could ‚Äústop the spread‚Äù. And now that we FINALLY can actually put an end to this, fucking Fauci STILL wants us to social distance and not see friends and family? Fuck this shit. It makes me so goddamn angry. Rant over</p>
<p>Edit: Also, I‚Äôm blessed to live in Florida where our governor actually listens to science and lets people get out of their houses. Aside from his stance on masks, he‚Äôs done a good job. All of this is to say that I haven‚Äôt been locked down since May; rather, just restricted a bit. I can‚Äôt fucking imagine the people in NY or Cali who will be locked down forever</p>

        <p>I just discovered this sub as well and it‚Äôs been refreshing to see that so many people see through the bullshit of this past year. </p>
<p>I started out really believing what we were being told, always being skeptical because I‚Äôm someone who likes to educate myself and think realistically, but always adhering to the guidelines. Dealing with being laid off for almost 3 months while we shut down ‚Äúfor two weeks.‚Äù Staying home and staying away from people outside of my household. Wiping everything down with Lysol wipes constantly, all of it. I tried to think of my fellow man and do the right things because if we did those, we would ‚Äúget through this together.‚Äù <em>eye roll</em> I missed out on spending time with my beloved aunt in her last few months because of this shit. I will never get that time back because she passed away in June 2020. Not Covid related btw.</p>
<p>It feels like this will never end and I see now there is much more to this than a virus. This is a politically and financially motivated manufactured ‚Äúpandemic.‚Äù</p>
<p>Today, I literally couldn‚Äôt enter my own bank, the place that holds MY hard earned money, because God forbid we do anything in person apparently. I really want to withdraw it all, what little is left after the financial strains of this past year, and put it under my mattress like the old days. </p>
<p>My 4 year old son‚Äôs school just got through being shut down for two weeks because so many staff members had been ‚Äúexposed‚Äù to someone who tested positive that they could not provide in person instruction for two weeks. He is in preschool learning things that he will need for the rest of his life, but we can just do some activities at home and he will be fine. They quickly learned that 4 year olds in front of screens all day doesn‚Äôt work and they abandoned that, so it‚Äôs up to me to be a teacher, while also doing all the other things expected of a working mother. </p>
<p>My older (9 year old) son now has to miss out on snow days and has ‚Äúremote learning‚Äù days when it snows since they expect these kids to be attached to their Chromebooks now. His education is greatly suffering on these days, especially considering he is on the autism spectrum and really needs, and does tremendously well with, in person instruction. </p>
<p>Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, we are so lucky and live in an area that has been almost full in person learning since October, but what good is it when you shut the schools down all the time because of a positive case? Did we ever shut down like this when it was flu season? Shit, I had swine flu in 2009 and almost died in an ICU for 5 days, and not a fucking thing was shut down that year. </p>
<p>We haven‚Äôt seen much family in months and I feel like so many on here, that we will be ridiculed by others if we even tried to, or God forbid tried to go on a vacation or any kind of outing, if you can even find places that are open around here. </p>
<p>My boss would be the first to reprimand me and constantly harasses all of us to get the vaccine. I just appease her and say I will schedule an appointment soon. By soon, I actually mean never. No thanks on generically modifying my body. My poor coworker who is pregnant had to ask the boss to stop harassing her about it because she is absolutely not injecting something into herself not knowing the affects on her unborn child and possible future fertility. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs all just getting so overwhelming, the financial stress, the schooling at home when I am not qualified to be a teacher, the lack of social interaction with family and fiends, the lack of recreation and fun, watching my young boys, who have done so well with all of this, lose a chunk of their otherwise happy and healthy childhood, lose out on school events, extracurricular activities, birthdays and holidays, even just picnics or trips to the park. </p>
<p>Thank you for providing a place to vent and be with people who truly just want this madness to end. I‚Äôm sorry for the length of this, but thank you also to anyone who takes the time to read it. It has helped me feel slightly better just getting this out. Peace to you all.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm at my favorite bar again. No masks or social distancing enforced. Curfew was lifted last week. But I still am having a hard time enjoying myself. </p>
<p>Existential dread constantly looms over me. No matter what I drink, take, how much I sleep, I sober/wake up and realize most of humanity are sheep that will allow government to infringe on human rights. </p>

        <p>I fucking can't take it anymore. It's been months since I have met my friends (I go to a boarding school and all of my friends live other countries and the one who doesn't is too afraid of CoRoNA to meet me). Sometimes we talk to each other with voice chat, but it's shit. We just sit in front of the computer for 2 hours and none of us has anything to say, because nothing happens. Going out doesn't do anything. Everything is closed and because I live in the shit country of Germany, there aren't any "secretly open" bars or something I can go to, because everyone buys the propaganda our media throws around nonstop. I'm stuck in a miniscule, boring village with my parents who don't take me seriously. They always say something like "you just need to go out and have some fresh air and everything will be fine". Well, sorry, but going for a walk won't make the lockdown disappear. </p>
<p>They said sholl will be opened. Yeah, very cool. There are two groups who go to school interchangingly (so they never meet each other). And guess what? All of my friends and people I'm good with are in the other group. No chance of visiting each other at all.</p>
<p>I'm extremely irritable and rage on every single thing that doesn't work. I have conflicts with my parents all the time and I yell at them, even if I don't want to. Maybe it's because I have Aspergers or something idk, but it was never as bad as now.  </p>
<p>I'm just angry all the time. I hate the government, I hate the society that just goes along with everything and even praises it. I look at other countries: Poland - economy open, Russia - open, Florida - open, Tanzania - open, Sweden - was never closed. So WHY why the fuck does Germany have to be closed down? The hospitals are EMPTY. NO ONE IS FUCKING DYING except a few very old people and people with preexisting conditions. That is a fact. But no "mainstream" newspaper will say it. No, instead they only repeat the words of our politicians. "Just a little bit more, we're all in this together, cooperate to save lives". This is what they are saying since AN ENTIRE YEAR. There are multiple studies that show decline in education and rise of psychological problems in children and teenagers. But the government ignores this. They don't care about us. They fuck entire future generations so that 89 year olds can live 5 months longer. </p>
<p>They are destroying small buisnesses. They promised financial relief, but guess who got it? Yeah, multi million Euro companies who had no financial propblems whatsoever, not the people who really needed it. </p>
<p>And there is nothing that can be done. We've had protests since the beginning of this shit, even big ones like in Berlin. Scientific proof, that this is all bullshit is being swept under the rug and ignored.</p>

        <p>I completely understand your frustration and anger. I often feel like we are all pawns in a game there is no way out of. I‚Äôm an introvert so it hasn‚Äôt been as hard for me as more extroverted people, but I can see how hard this must be for extroverts not to have that lifeline of physical human interaction. It is a basic need for all of us for our mental, emotional and physical well-being, and more so for extroverted people, which it sounds like you are. You might try thinking about what things can you control, and exercising what freedoms you do still have... What is there in your life to be grateful for? You will probably have to get creative and dig deep but finding one or two small things can really make a difference. Read up on examples of Holocaust survivors who kept their hope by hanging on to some small choice they got to make for themselves. It can be powerful and change your whole mindset. </p>
<p>Another thing that can really help is building a relationship with God, the Divine, or whatever you want to call your Higher Power. It‚Äôs not what people who aren‚Äôt religious or believers want to hear, but believing in something outside of yourself changes your perspective. Hoping you find peace. Feel free to PM if you need someone to chat with.</p>

        <p>This too shall pass.  I agree 100% with what you said, but don't let them win.  If you're angry, depressed, hopeless, hostile, that's what they want.  What they dont want is for you to go out, make friends with your neighbors, gain new skills, create new things, a d find self fulfillment.   That's how we beat this.  Stay strong brother.</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry you're going through this. It's so sad and unfair. Take heart that more people are seeing the truth behind the lies and paying attention to the men behind the curtains. Try and download a free meditation app like insight timer. It may help you with your strong feelings. Try journaling and getting out in nature if you can. Or if you want, find a local activism group where you can teach and educator others about the truth.  You voice matters.</p>

        <p>Today a coworker asked me in my virtual classroom IN FRONT OF ALL MY STUDENTS if I had scheduled my vaccine yet. I had to say just "No." And leave it at that and move on to the actual math problems my kids were doing.</p>
<p>Lol no. Don't ask people that. Why do you have to assume everyone will just go get it? Not everyone wants to get a vaccine that is a) made too quickly and has not been tested for very long and b) that is unethically made. </p>
<p>But because I don't want to get fired for saying I'm not getting it at all and students hearing this and tattling it to their parents and causing a mess, I just have say "No."</p>

        <p>&rt;made too quickly and has not been tested for very long</p>
<p>I'm no expert but I believe the reason the virus was created so swiftly was our understanding of different covid strains and the use of mrna type vaccines which is a new type of vaccine. Again, im not an expert by any means but I trust medical science more than Facebook science.</p>
<p>&rt;that is unethically made.</p>

        <p>They got me.</p>
<p>It won't ever be the same. They got the world. Everything they wanted will be theirs. Why does it really matter to them? What is everlasting riches and control ultimately worth? Don't know. But it's theirs. I feel sorta like the most self-aware guinea pig. I'm 16 and half of my life has been essentially the "lockdown" but as a regular lifestyle. Not so much by choice. Long story though. It's a weird thing where that's left me to my thoughts and prompted me to become such an open-minded person, but yet numbed me and made me miserable in the exact way I think they want everyone to be. I'm so alone. I became attached to someone online recently and that's really fucked me up. The whole online communication thing is just so unnatural. You can't truly know what people are thinking, and they can't know what you're really thinking. And now I can't get a job without restricting my oxygen intake. It was always just me, but now it's REALLY just me. I was able to ignore it for so long but for the first time in a long time I'm waking up wishing the dreams were reality. This is just not life. This is inhumane. And there's no going back. I don't know what to do.</p>

        <p>I really appreciate it. I do have access to each of the things you mentioned besides an income source, thankfully. All I've wanted this whole time is meaningful connection with people. I've gotten it from select friends online through the years but so far there's only one I know is here to stay. And still our relationship is a bit distant. Partially because we're on different ends when it comes to this subject about the world and why it is the way it is. It's sort of a wonder I've made it this far, so I know I can keep going. I just don't know why I am and that's what makes it hard.</p>

        <p>Finding meaningful connection with people can be so hard. I have a very small group of friends, but tbh I lost that connection with most of them. I need new friends, but I‚Äôm so picky it‚Äôs quite a challenge. My most valuable friendships came from online contacts, it‚Äôs special how you can sometimes connect so deeply with someone you never met. I hope the coming years for you will get better!

        <p>Thank you. I would hold onto the hope of "when this all ends" but I've researched this whole situation extensively and I know, even if corona itself "goes away" society won't be the same. It's been planned for at least 2 or 3 centuries. Maybe not this specific scenario, but one where people are willing to accept literal nonsense as reality. So, I'm just making it day by day.

I‚Äôve spent most of my adult life traveling overseas and have experienced a tremendous number of different cultures and social dynamics. I was in Cambodia, for a year, when the guys I would meet that were my age would casually tell me all about the day their families were raped and murdered. I‚Äôve spent twenty years asking important questions of individuals all over the world. We‚Äôre fucked. We are so far down the road of dehumanization that it is absolutely sickening.

        <p>It‚Äôs nearly impossible for them to grasp. I don‚Äôt want to dox myself, but let‚Äôs just say my head got smashed through the brick wall that is the facade of society twenty years ago and have been predicting all this since. Mortality is something that is hard to appreciate until you see it disappear in front of you. Everybody acting insane is just protecting what they see as their own mortality by filling in the blanks with religious-level belief.</p>
<p>I had a friend who was in the Hitler Youth and saw his neighbors getting hauled off. I asked him in 2005 what I should be most concerned about in the future, because we were talking about exactly this kind of situation:</p>
<p>‚ÄúWillful ignorance combined with an absolute belief and in the purity of one‚Äôs intentions to help others.‚Äù He left America because of the growing divisiveness we both felt.</p>

        <p>Wear three masks because one doesn't work but you still have wear at least one mask. If you're vaccinated then you still have to social distance and wear at least one mask. You need two doses of the vaccine. The vaccine may only work for one year. We developed this vaccine in under one year but we assure you it is safe. You will lose your job. You cannot see your family. You cannot go to church. You must comply.</p>
<p>Honestly fuck all of this shit. Im so done with everyone thinking that this is actually comparable to a real pandemic. If you cannot open your eyes and see that this is only about money, power, and reform then you need to actually see a doctor (but wait you can't do that either). This "new normal" needs to fucking end and if it does not, then we will eventually revolt.</p>

        <p>Idk how to cope anymore honestly. I'm at the point now where even when things are back to "normal" or atleast lockdowns are over, I have no friends left and my mental health is left in tatters idk how to fix. I lost my last remaining friendship group today and one of them called me selfish for crying on my birthday about being in lockdown. Idk why everyone is so happy to normalise this and people seem to completely disregard others mental health even if theyre supposedly your friends.

        <p>We are wired for connection. We are born to live with three dimensional interactions. You're not living in a normal setting and people are coming back to the realization slowly.  You're not selfish. Your feelings are valid and very understandable. I'm so sorry you're having to go through this.  Take good care and make as many human connections as you can in person a day.

It took me 6 mins to stop panting because walking a flight of steps takes a colossal effort. 
Yet my biggest fear is my aged parents catching it from me because if they do it's s death sentence because one of them has asthma and the other had an invasive surgery that leaves her vulnerable beyond belief. </p>

<p>What other virus can make you lose your senses? Which virus Can affect people so differently that some won't even notice while others can die from it. </p>
<p>While the lockdowns were over excessive, you claiming it's a "mild cough" proves you're a grunt and should stop thinking about smart people subjects.</p>

        <p>Did you know that the UK is putting travelers arriving from the majority of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/transport-measures-to-protect-the-uk-from-variant-strains-of-covid-19">African countries, as well as South America</a> in quarantine hotels, over concerns about the new' South African strain' and the 'Brazilian strain'? Just take a look, do you see many 'white' countries on this list? Did you know that if one of these people lies on their documents about which 'filthy' and 'diseased' country they come from, they face up to <a href="https://news.sky.com/video/covid-19-up-to-ten-years-in-prison-for-falsifying-passenger-locator-forms-12213308">10 years</a> in prison? Yes, that's right, black and brown people from 'shithole' countries aren't allowed in, even though they've handled the pandemic way better than the UK (probably by not paying much attention to it and letting people live and earn money, but that's another story). Not only that but they've named the strains after these countries. All over the world we call them south african and brazilian strain. But that's not racist enough to enrage you.</p>
<p>Did you know that in the beginning of the pandemic black tenants in China were <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/coronavirus-china-mcdonalds-black-people-home-evictions-a9465776.html">kicked out of their flats </a>and refused service by Mcdonalds?</p>
<p>Nope. If you don't like the way we talk about the WuFlu (thanks to which we'll never see normality again) go somewhere else.</p>

        <p>I could give a fuck about what anyone thinks, it's not like humanity is ever to progress past post-ww2 without a deity coming down/up from wherever they've been hiding and literally force humans into the next step.</p>
<p>And yes, I did know that China makes middle east countries with sharia law look like 23rd century utopias. The fucking Chinese boomers are literally doing the nazi Germany playbook with reeducation camps and forced sterilization (not that America isn't doing that with immigrants but that's another time) and the entire world just cares about how ending relationships with China would, at best, make shareholders upset and worst case, ole Pooh bear in Shanghai nukes the world.</p>

        <p>There are dozens of other diseases that cause you to lose your sense of smell, virtually all of them more serious than COVID, because COVID is among the only ones that doesn't last for years or for life.</p>
<p>The, uh, flu, does exactly that.  So do a lot of other bugs.  TB, for example.  Viral pneumonia.  Really quite a few.</p>

<p>While I do expect this to continue to be a growing trend, that depends on us too.</p>

        <p>i'm glad i came across this subred</p>
<p>my level of frustration with this whole covid bullshit and this 'life' we had for the last year (if u can call it that) are over the roof. been unemployed since november, the monthly benefit i get is less than i made in a week for the last few years, and i'm just a chef. i'm behind with everything and the debts are just getting bigger and bigger and i'm just sitting here reading emails how they won't progress my application any further from places like FUCKIN TESCO. it's getting fuckin hard day by day to just not flip out.  i might have a job lining up whenever hospitality reopens, if i can hold on till that time, but its a big maybe. i haven't been able to go the dentist since march because the last time i was at my dentistry was more than  2 years ago so they took me off their active patient list and they are not accepting new ones ever since we have this flulike shit. so i started calling up dentistries jn the area, NONE OF THE NHS ONES (uk) accept new patients but private ones do, except i can't afford it. i had one nhs one that offered me to ASSESS it but NOT TREAT it (WTF). we have vaccines yet the restrictions and lockdown is gonnabe longer than it was last year when we didn't know if it was an actual deadly virus or not (spoiler: its not). it just doesn't add up at all yet many many people are okay with it and no matrer what facts u are telling them they just keep repeating the same fuckin sentences like a brainwashed cultist. i never believed in any of these popular conspiracy theories whatsoever but something is fuckin off here</p>

        <p>You see I always went there. They were open and never told me "we aren't supposed to sell you anything" so it was maybe due to the 6PM curfew. </p>
<p>I'm not sure if bars are locked or not.</p>
<p>Everytime the bar was lit and bartenders were in it, door was open, so I just went there everytime and bought my food and they told me to hide it in my bag.</p>
<p>Perhaps a different lady was there that day, and they decided to open the bar only to top up your phone?</p>
<p>Seriously I am confused why keeping it open if I am told you can't sell unless I hide it. Police WOULD see the bar as open (it's a bar and newsagents combo)</p>

        <p>Most beautiful country on Earth?</p>
<p>With such sly people?</p>
<p>With people getting high in dopamine, satisfied that they acted sly, even when there's no gain for them?</p>
<p>With people that look down on you if you pay tax and respect others?</p>
<p>With people that see you as a slave if you are a girl and would treat males better even in your own family?</p>
<p>With parents being SAD and disgusted if a girl is born, instead of a boy?</p>
<p>Being Italian makes me wanna throw up</p>

        <p>Food &amp; the physical country was what I was talking about. </p>
<p>Btw generalizing like that about an entire population of people that you don‚Äôt know personally or individually isn‚Äôt a healthy mindset to have. Take people as individuals before you judge. Trust me you‚Äôll make more friends and live a happier life bcuz of it. </p>
<p>I for example abhor the religion of Islam. That being said I was a doorman for some time during which I met &amp; worked with many Muslim men who I made friends with because I didn‚Äôt judge them upon some preconceived notion of what I thought a Muslim was. </p>
<p>Not sure what you mean by sly btw but I hope I helped you maybe have a better outlook on the world around you.</p>
<p>Last thing I have to say is that I just had my 1st child. I really wanted to have a son. We had a little girl. I love her with all my heart she‚Äôs the cutest little fart machine &amp; I wouldn‚Äôt trade her for anything in the world.</p>

        <p>I had other examples of this in real life, although a guy pointed to me that this only happens in Southern Italy (where I live). Have been confirmed as a "cultural" thing and when ignorant people do it, it becomes worse.</p>
<p>Saw MANY moms say in public to their daughters "him doing chores like you? He is the male, he can be lazy all he wants, bitch!" Et similia.</p>

        <p>I never meant "all of them", was just speaking my experience and referencing South Italy.</p>
<p>What Italians do you know, and which zone are they from? </p>
<p>In my town I've seen:</p>
<p>Females who are frowned upon when they don't act girly</p>
<p>Females who, despite having done all chores, even cooking for their dads and ENTIRE families, were seen as selfish once they relaxed</p>
<p>Males who don't do chores and mama couldn't be happier at the mess they made, not batting an eye (while boys doing chores exist among my Italian friends, both south and north).</p>
<p>Females not doing chores for other adults when they were an only child and STILL being hated.</p>
<p>If you are a girl you are a tool in most South Italy zones. Not just the chores part but everything.</p>
<p>I am single and voila, the disgust is all on me.</p>

        <p>Idk why people expect to have EVERYONE vaccinated so we can go back to normal (at least in Mexico)</p>
<p>They're making calculations "at this rate by 2026 everyone wouldn finally be vaccinated"</p>
<p>I'm not against vaccination, but this is just dumb, I have never gotten the Flu vaccine, non my closest family, why would the entire populations would need to be with this one? Just vaccinate the health workers and maybe the elderly, the rest should be optional.</p>

        <p>Two quick points that are important for you to take into account. </p>
<p>1) The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines have been studied extensively, in tens of thousands of patients, which is really important, because if they only tested them in like 150 patients, it‚Äôs fair to say that many adverse events or even just the frequency of those adverse events wouldn‚Äôt be well understood. But, by testing them in tens of thousands of patients, you really do have a solid understanding of the extent of the side effects as well as the efficacy. </p>
<p>2) this is not a mild respiratory disease, now maybe your argument is that for 17-year olds it is, but the problem here is that it‚Äôs an infectious disease, you contracting it carries the very real potential to infect others, some of which are not as young and able to fight off the disease. It would be analogous to saying we all shouldn‚Äôt worry about Hepatitis C, because the virus takes a very long time (typically 20-30 years) before it starts to take a real toll on your health; if we took this view as a society, we‚Äôd set in motion a major health crisis for the future, and likely for younger generations to deal with. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the reality is that this virus is real, and it‚Äôs really dangerous, but just in a different way than we‚Äôre used to... keep in mind that we all accept the existence and threat of HIV, which is far less contagious, but infinitely more deadly when contracted (if not treated). </p>
<p>And here‚Äôs the most important thing I can say to you... sometimes, it‚Äôs easier to deny or diminish the severity of a threat, than to face the cold reality of the situation. We do this as a defense mechanism, rationalizing the fear and lack of understanding we feel. It‚Äôs human to feel that way. But you have to resist that urge, it‚Äôs incredibly important that you do... because the irony of this act, is that by denying or diminishing, you only protect the threat, allowing it to fester and grow even larger and more impactful in scale... like a bully on a playground that‚Äôs never put in his place. Instead, we have to, as a society, punch this bully on the nose good and hard. </p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>

        <p>I have these two really good friends of mine, known them since we were kids. I was even a groomsman at their wedding last year. Earlier today they send me a Snapchat video message showing them getting the covid vaccine...... I just don‚Äôt know what to say, I am in shock. They‚Äôre both perfectly healthy and in their late 20‚Äôs for fucks sake. The chance of them even getting covid, let alone surviving it is such a none issue for them! Their immune systems can fight it off!</p>
<p>While they‚Äôre out celebrating and seem relieved thinking they‚Äôre immune, I can‚Äôt help but feel disappointed and scared for them. What‚Äôs even more sad is they want to try and have kids one day! I pray this doesn‚Äôt ruin the chance for them to have a family or god forbid either one falls ill due to the vaccines side effects.</p>

        <p>I got the Moderna vaccine. I am pro-choice (skeptical)about vaccines, but I volunteered for the trial. I was just desperate for any way I could be able to see my family and return to church and school. I have been unblinded and know 100% I got two doses of the real thing. This was in August/September. Each time I totally lost the use of my left arm for several days. Needed help putting on pants. Couldn't properly care for my kids. It was brutal. 2nd time was worse, fever and disorientation. Fatigue lasted 2 months. So far no permanent effects, and yes, I was tested and my fertility is still intact. It is a hardship an it should be voluntary for sure. Not everyone can be off work 8 days and get someone to take care of their kids/them while they're going through something like that. Some people like having that option despite the risks.</p>

<p>How does the test work, exactly?</p>
<p>And wasn't the concern something about the immune system attacking the umbilical cord? How could you test for anything like that, short of carrying a baby to full term post-vaccination?</p>

        <p>They test your FSH and estradiol. Mine were normal. I insisted on the tests because I had night sweats and was paranoid that I was going into menopause. I am still fertile. Whether or not I have developed an autoimmune disorder that would attack an umbilical cord I can't answer. I have heard that can happen if the baby has different blood RH? That's what RHOGam is for.</p>

        <p>It makes me laugh how desperate the government is to fearmonger. I'm in Canada and the 'health experts' keep trying to hype up an end of March spike in cases. And the chart they concocted <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/magpie/blog/high-transmission-variant-modelling.html">looks like a fucking rocketship launch it's almost comical.</a></p>
<p>Like, anyone with a fucking brain can do some research and see that pretty much every country in the northern hemisphere is seeing a substantial drop in cases all at the same time, which is very indicative of seasonality being the main factor for the spread of this virus. And if I have to hear "tHe vArIaNtS!!" one more fucking time... Even the UK, where this supposed "extremely contagious" variant emerged is seeing a big drop in cases. </p>
<p>There's just no evidence to even remotely suggest the massive spike in cases they're projecting. But of course the doomers are eating shit shit up and cowering away indoors.</p>

        <p>I really need to vent. Firstly, I need to say that I‚Äôm super grateful I still have a great job, and I truly feel for small business owners and anyone that has lost their job because of these lockdowns/restrictions. I know I‚Äôm ‚Äúlucky‚Äù in comparison to a lot of people but I‚Äôm honestly losing the will to live. </p>
<p>The city I live in has the most overreaching restrictions of any city in North America. We are still in a full lockdown (and there‚Äôs talks of extending it) - I haven‚Äôt been able to get a haircut or any personal care/grooming services for MONTHS.. basic things that make me feel clean and good about myself. The winters here were already long and miserable before, now it‚Äôs 100x worse. </p>
<p>I‚Äôve tried to stay positive. I‚Äôve been working on a side project that will hopefully become a business, I‚Äôve been reading and learning new things, but I just can‚Äôt live like this anymore. I‚Äôm a young person in my 20s and I‚Äôm literally not allowed to live a normal life or enjoy myself. It‚Äôs been hard to hang out with friends or meet new ones. All I do everyday is wake up, sit in front of my computer to work, workout, read and go to sleep. The weekends are pretty much the same - all I do is hang out on the couch inside, read and work on things (I hate the cold and was planning to get into winter activities to get outside but they banned that too).</p>
<p>Even after all the lockdowns are lifted, what is the aftermath going to look like? I can take a wild fucking guess - increased homelessness, suicides (which I know is already happening), increased costs and cost of living (in an already very expensive city), etc. It‚Äôs just like what is the point of this anymore? I can‚Äôt even bring myself to care about people‚Äôs 90 year old grandparents dying from covid anymore because they already got to live their lives, and I‚Äôm being robbed of mine. And who will pay for all of the consequences of these never ending lockdowns? Oh yes - me and other young working professionals. </p>
<p>I‚Äôm planning to move somewhere warmer and hopefully more free but I know realistically that can‚Äôt happen for a couple of years, which means I have to continue living in this awful city.</p>

        <p>This hits close to home. The entire state of New Jersey is going to sink into the Atlantic when they lift the restrictions. Most of these folks have no idea that the immediate lockdown will be followed by at least 2-3 years of economic recession.</p>

        <p>I post on the corona subs often about how I met someone in a foreign country right before the world shut down. It's been a year since we've seen each other outside of pictures. (Video call isn't a possibility since he lives in a rural area with spotty phone signal -- even the rain stops us from texting sometimes.) I'm just sad today and complaining about it here instead of drinking.</p>
<p>I'm 31. I want a partner and a family. (Not children necessarily, but to belong to a family. The one I was born into sucks.) But I want <em>that</em> person and <em>that</em> family, specifically. I don't want to settle for someone just because they live here.</p>
<p>"Normal" isn't haircuts and chain restaurants. It's not having to grieve people who are still alive.</p>

        <p>Not mocking at all.  I"m being serious as we know the mental and emotional results of these lockdowns (especially in kids) is going to be much worse than the actual virus.  They never should have been allowed.   Suicide rates/attempts are off the charts and the "health experts" should be held accountable for it as most of "covid" deaths weren't actually from Covid and then of course the media for never even questioning it.</p>

        <p>I'm so tired of these online classes man. When this whole lockdown first started, I was doing pretty well for about 10 weeks. After that though, the isolation combined with my dislike of the program I'm studying really started to kick in, and I've been burned out ever since</p>
<p>I have very little free time due to my studies, and whatever free time I do have, I waste it gaming (something I don't even really enjoy anymore). That's about it. There's nothing I want to watch on TV, I have few hobbies, I have next to no friends. I speak an average of 10 minutes a day (and even that's a stretch). </p>
<p>I'm just fucking angry. Why did we allow things to get this bad? Not even wrt to lockdowns, but the education system, the political sphere, everything.</p>

        <p>It will swing back. People's brains can only handle so much 2 dimensional before they suffer. TRy to go out and connect to as much nature as you can when you have breaks. Even if it's a walk around the block. Notice everything you hear, smell, and see. Go touch a tree and it's leaves. You will feel better. I'm sorry this stinks. It's not normal.</p>

        <p>Repeatedly. I mean, just over and over again we have all heard "experts" and "leaders" tell us that even if we get both vaccinations, we must keep wearing the mask and social distancing. Just the other day, Biden said we need to wear masks for at least the next year. So when I read a comment on a corona-hysteria subreddit that says...</p>
<p><strong><em>"Most normal people are going to say, "Well, why rush to get the vaccine when I have to wear this thing all the time anyway? I thought the vaccines work? I was excited to get the vaccine so (after waiting the requisite month or so after the second dose), I could take my mask OFF. If I can't....what's the point?" I don't think he realizes how much damage he is doing. I hear these comments from many family members and I just say, "That's not what's going to happen." And here it is."</em></strong></p>
<p>Or..</p>
<p><strong><em>"That will only be true in some areas. In half of the country, mask mandates will be over within the month. Once spring protest season starts, we‚Äôll see how long it takes the remaining areas to fall."</em></strong></p>
<p>I just feel compelled to shake these people and ask "where are you getting these ideas from?" It is total cognitive dissonance when you can listen to multiple "experts" tell you repeatedly that "we don't know if the vaccine stops transmission so you will have to keep wearing the mask and social distancing even after receiving it" and somehow hear that messaging but twist it in your own mind to mean that "well, what they're really saying is of course we have to wear masks until everyone gets both doses of the vaccine" <strong><em>THAT IS NOT WHAT THE "EXPERTS" ARE SAYING, NOR IS IT WHAT THEY HAVE EVER SAID ABOUT THIS VACCINE.</em></strong></p>
<p>Never once have I read an article saying "once everyone is vaccinated you can take your mask off." They literally all say "you can't take your mask off because we don't know if the vaccine prevents transmission of the virus."</p>
<p>I guess my question is, why on earth would anyone just make up a completely false reality like this? Does it help them cope or what? I mean, with Biden last week saying we need to wear the masks another year, it is very clear the masks and social distancing are not going away any time soon.</p>
<p>Also, just lol at the commenter who says they "wish fauci would stop saying this stuff because it deters people from wanting the vaccine if they think things won't go back to normal even if they get it"</p>
<p>So apparently that person just wants fauci to lie because it makes them feel better. And lol at all the people in the comments in that post "correcting" and "explaining" fauci and what he meant. He and Biden mean what they say. They do not need interpretation. Fauci said keep wearing the mask, we don't know if the vaccine stops transmission and last week Biden said we have to wear masks for another year at least. So that is what they are saying. And no they don't mean "just the unvaccinated people" they mean everyone because they don't know if the vaccine stops transmission.</p>

<p>I can't believe the dead silence to her legitimate question towards them. No, wait, actually I can believe it. They don't give a shit.

She asked about what data they used to make the 'doomsday modeling' of projected COVID cases and they basically had no answers for her. </p>

        <p>It was amazing, but also super depressing since like you said, no one will see this shit. It's just a circus performance if anything and the media will take a hard pass at even giving any attention to it since that'd cause people to lose faith in the 'experts' and can't have that since it goes against the narrative. Oh well. </p>
<p>At least it seems to have gotten a bit of attention on Twitter judging by the likes.</p>

        <p>This isn‚Äôt a flu season. This is a novel virus and the reason we shut down so harshly was in part because of our lack of understanding of it in the beginning, and of course to ease the surges on hospitals that would lead to countless unnecessary deaths. In the future I hope that this increases the rate of yearly flu vaccinations and honestly I‚Äôm not entirely opposed to wearing masks in public spaces if I feel even a little ill in the future to keep from infecting others. Hopefully these collective behaviors will lower flu deaths in future years, and COVID could stand as a real lesson for us all. </p>
<p>But you make a good point, We all have to be comfortable with some level of risk to function in modern society. We can‚Äôt save everybody and we have to be prepared to get back to relative normal. But for some reason this subreddit disagrees with the relative little I asked for in the paragraph above for how to combat future influenza, which is why I‚Äôm so angry on this subreddit. The vast majority of you are against the simplest actions that could save lives not only in this pandemic, but also in future influenza seasons. But again, this is not a regular flu. attempting to equate the two is a bad faith argument and you know it.</p>

        <p>The simplest actions those at risk could take would drastically change the whole of society for the better. </p>
<p>Getting out more and exercising, eating healthy, dropping nasty habits, being more mindful, but no. Instead they want governments to spend money on useless theater like plexiglass and shitty masks that pollute the environment more than burger wrappers did in the 80's. </p>
<p>In Texas they spent billions of dollars on plexiglass when they could have spent that on winterizing the electrical grid. Which would have been preferable to those of them that went through 5 days of no water or heat? All precautions were thrown out the window when we went grocery shopping in the brief 5 hours they were open. Lifestyle changes will lower sickness across the board for many diseases and it almost cost nothing monetarily in comparison to what they spent already. No disease is the same but we do know that the best way to avoid it overtaking us is to be healthier.</p>

        <p>Rona is more transmissible and more virulent than flu. The comparison between the two is one of degree. At this stage of the game it's quickly becoming disingenuous to justify restrictions on the basis that the virus is so novel. It isn't. It's been around at least 15 months and there are vaccines to fight it, and the vaccines themselves are far more effective (allegedly) than the vaccines used to fight flu. With hospitalizations and cases cratering and vaccinations running at almost 2 million per day, how much longer do restrictions persist? </p>
<p>As for the measures in your first paragraph, I reject them. Why? Because every time we give an inch we lose a mile. "2 weeks to flatten the curve" became 50 weeks to flatten the curve, the economy, hundreds of thousands of businesses, children's education and happiness, hopes, dreams, freedom and damn near everything else. Masks went from useless, to recommended, and then to mandatory. And there's no hard limit on any of this. Why would I believe anyone who tells me they want flu shots and masks to be voluntary? How long can I expect the voluntary part to last? Every human interaction from casual conversation to having sex carries the risk of inciting lethal biological contamination on another person. It's sad, but that's how it is. And trying to avoid pathogens means excising the things that make life worthwhile in the first place. No more masks, period. If you're afraid of the sniffles, you are welcome to use one whenever you like.</p>

        <p>It only become 50 weeks because people don't follow the regulations by wearing the masks and maintaining social distancing. I live in Taiwan and lemme tell you, <em>because</em>we followed all the strict regulations and wore the masks when asked, we have the lowest amount of deaths in the entire world. Not to mention now our daily lives is almost exactly the same as pre-corona era. Kids are back in school, offices are open and economy is back on track. You guys literally have zero excuse because this wouldn't have happened if you would just follow the damn fucking regulations. All of you people in this sub are just trying to be a hero in a story that doesn't exist.</p>

Well, it's now 2-10 weeks until impending doom, but cases have dropped like 50% since then and continue to do so. How can supposed "experts" be so goddamned wrong?</p>

        <p>Hi everyone, </p>
<p>For one of my research projects this year at York University (final year of my undergrad) I have to choose a movement I feel passionate about and interview those that are involved in it. None of my friends, co-workers or peers are in any way supportive of the ideas being shared on this sub. If anyone would like to be interviewed with regards to their opinions on the lockdown movement it would be greatly appreciated. It can be done over email, zoom, etc... I simply need to interview like-minded people on the topic of lockdowns/masking.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

        <p>I'm eligible for some additional relief funding through my tribe. And what should be a relief is frustrating. My white dad is giving me shit for taking it, but I was self employed before all this shit ruined me and it doesn't look like things will be looking up for a very long time. I just don't see why I shouldn't take help if the tribal government is offering it, and of course both my parents are pro extended lockdown because they're retired and it doesn't affect them at all. </p>

        <p>Why don‚Äôt the people propagating mask usage for vaccinated people realize they are a huge impediment to getting people vaccinated? They always like to say what‚Äôs the big deal about wearing a mask. Well it‚Äôs not just the mask- it implies distancing. What use is a mask if you take it off around others? People that want to see their family and friends again will view it as status quo. It‚Äôs just plain stupid</p>

        <p>Can someone explain to me how nova scotians think? Weve been posted out to skasktchewam but want to vist home with the new baby. However they've got mandatory 2 week quarantine for anyone coming in outside the bubble. So tonight I'm video chatting with my mom and nan and they're all I wish we could hold him, and i say you would if ns wasnt such a stupid place, she says ns is a great place we have the lowest numbers in the country. Like nope stupid place, you destroyed so many small businesses and the tourism industry has taken a major hit, but hey least your numbers are low. Like samn the stupid rules you're supporting g are the reason you haven't seen your grandkids. Rant over</p>

        <p>Is there an option in the post report function to leave a "just reporting to block" comment for the mods, or a way to block someone without reporting? We've had a few repeat-offender trolls, but the only way I know to block them is to report first. Would rather not get posts deleted unless it's serious forum-sliding spam or blatantly off-topic and disruptive, like the guy who was posting porn a couple of weeks ago.</p>

        <p>Oh the look on my parents face today when they heard about the roadmap out of lockdown, my mother was like 'What about my social distancing and masks!?' and they just keep saying that we 'won't get to that point' and that there will be 'restrictions in the winter' it's not that can't get out of it, people don't want to get out of it, we're stuck in this horrible cycle that people, for some reason, actually like, i think they're secretly hoping for cases to raise so there's another lockdown, and my dad says 'This family will live by the goverments rules'</p>

        <p>I'll upvote this because the sentiment needs to be reckoned with. </p>
<p>Currently, we are being told in one breath that the mRNA vaccines are over 90% effective. And in the next breath, we are told that it "might" be safe for vaccinated people to hug but that masks and various other bullshit is still required everywhere. So which is it? Do these vaccines actually work? And if they do, why are the incompetent health authorities slow walking the return to normal?</p>
<p>In the current environment, a vaccine only makes sense if you are actually at risk. If not, there's no point. I won't be blackmailed and dangled with normalcy yet again only to see it recede into more empty promises. Tell vaccinated people to enjoy their lives and resume normal. And drop the restrictions. Not prepared to do that? Then go fuck yourself.</p>
