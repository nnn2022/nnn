    <strong>Seems like everyone who has died from the virus is fat?</strong>
    <p><p>Every time I see one of these articles about someone dying I think so myself “let me guess, they’re fat” and then I look at the photo pretty much without fail, they are always fat. </p>
<p>If you’re not fat you got nothing to worry about. </p>
<p>And nothing against fat folks—the odds are still in your favor even if you’re fat. Not as good, but still decent.</p></p>

        <p>Agreed and they also come in the “ I wish I had the jab but now I am on my deathbed” variety as a paid crisis actor. Someone put pictures of a paid crisis actors website on here, with a guy out of the telegraph and British press in a bed,on deaths door and I am sure they will use him again.</p>

        <p>Yea but that guy wasnt fat though. Whether he had covid or not, who knows. I had a buddy years ago who was white as a ghost, and he never went out during the day. Everyone in the group would joke about him being a vampire. He had a bit of a beer belly, but was not anywhere near overweight.</p>
<p>Ended up with H1N1, the pig flu and they had to put him in a iron lung for 3 or 6 months I think it was, until his lungs were healed enough that he could use them on his own again. They thought for sure he wasnt going to make it but he pulled through and is fine these days, last I checked.</p>
<p>I would say definitely maybe, that vitamin d deficiency or any vitamin deficiency plays a huge role in the immune system as well as being overweight or underweight.</p>

        <p>I know the guy with the black hair wasn’t fat as they
Mix it up a little. I say a little as there Jedi mind tricks aren’t that great. I was over weight myself 6 months ago and nearly lost my arm to an infection and my mate forced me to go to A and E. I like to just get on with things but I would died. I’ve lost the weight now and it’s only 2/3 stone but I was getting up to 19 stones and I am 6.2. I wasn’t healthy at all.</p>

        <p>The stats are misleading they say 78% of hospitalizations are obese or overweight but only 42% of people in the US are obese.  They left out how many people are overweight.  It something like 70% are obese or overweight.</p>

        <p>Yeah.  Fat folks are probably okay with hurting their survival chances.  It's not as if they weren't aware that obesity kills more than almost everything else.</p>
<p>is dying of heart disease and type II diabetes better than dying over covid?  End result is the same.</p>

<p>Covid seems relatively quick and painless from what I have seen.</p>

        <p>Well the data actually already told us who those people dying are likely to be.</p>
<p>95% of deaths are people over 50. 80% are people over 65. The average age of death is 79. Over 90% of deaths had comorbidities. 67% had 6 or more comorbidities! The people dying from this virus are largely older and unhealthy (obesity being the biggest driver). They all have access to the vaccines if they need them.</p>
<p>That's a long-winded way of saying yes, a lot of the obese are likely going to have more comorbidities...and thus more likely to have problems with covid</p>

        <p>I would like to add that it probably has nothing to do with weight, but if the person has a healthy lifestyle and attempts to keep their body fat at a healthy level. Instead of pushing a questionable vaccine, it would be more beneficial to push healthier living. Eat better and get some fresh air, sunshine and exercise.</p>

        <p>Idk, I think exercise and healthy eating has been pushed forever and everyone who gives a shit gets the point by now. </p>
<p>If I was fat I’d rather just get the vaccine than try to lose 200lbs in a week. But that’s just me. They can do whatever they want.</p>

        <p>I am fat, I have my theories as to why. I have struggled with weight since I was probably 10 or 11. When I was 16, I was 6 foot 3 and 280 lbs. <br>
Tried to join the army, they said I was 40 lbs overweight and I couldnt join bootcamp until I lost it. Found a full time job that didnt require a good chance at my potential death as a possibility and never pursued it after that.<br>
Most of my life I have been told that I am going to end up with diabetes and heart disease. I am almost 40 now and my sugar is great and my heart, physically is perfect. I am still overweight. I dont consume soda anymore, I consume very little take out food mainly because its to expensive here and even if I pay a 100 bucks for a meal, I am never satisfied with the quality. It's just easier, cheaper, and tastier to make the things I want. And I intermittent fast on a daily basis. I dont eat breakfast or lunch, even while working. If it werent for that, I would likely be in a different situation. <br>
I dont really care what I look like, doubly more so now that I have a partner. I just care what I feel like. And I have always felt healthy, well until I was poisoned with refrigerant, but thats a entirely different story. The only way I have been able to lose weight is if I run everyday and start eating less than 2000 calories a day. <br>
When I was on the betablockers, of course weight gain is a side effect and I hit the heaviest I have ever been in my life, about 340. Since getting off the beta blockers in the last year, Ive managed to get back down to 315. Id like to get back to 280 since that seems to be my natural resting weight, for whatever reason. <br>
I spent a year on a wait list for a family doctor, and when I tried to explain to him why I wasnt taking my beta blockers every day, he weighs me and tells me I am deathly obese and that he doesnt want to take me on as a patient because if something happens to me he would feel bad.<br>
Doctors, lol.</p>

        <p>yeah, i am a respiratory therapist and 95% are indeed obese, and or over 65. I saw a 72 year old fit man die, so there is that. My friend works in Phoenix at the biggest hospital in the southwest and reports that at least 90% of the deaths were among the obese, diabetic or elderly population. The absolute risk of dying from covid if you are under 50 is basically zero. Fucking circus</p>

        <p>The risk ratio for healthy people is 1.</p>
<p>For all intents and purposes that means there isn’t a risk. Every comorbidity increases your risk of death which doesn’t even need Covid to be true.</p>
<p>Be fit, active, eat healthy, don’t smoke, etc and Covid is about as dangerous as seasonal allergies.</p>

        <p>Isn’t risk ratio just relative risk between two groups? </p>
<p>If you compared fat people to healthy people then the risk ratio would be higher than one. If you compared healthy people to healthy people then…I guess it would be 1? That’s not really useful information though that’s just common sense.</p>

        <p>It tells you the statistical risk relative to the group that you fit in.</p>
<p>For example if you have 1 problem then you are 1.32x as likely to be admitted to the hospital. If 2-5 it’s 1.6x etc. Averages like case fatality ratio could then be used to get a rough estimate of relative risk in more precise groups. It’s not a perfect method since the average will overestimate risk to the healthy and underestimate risk to the diseases but at least it’s a starting point to frame real world risks.</p>
<p>Using <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html">CDC best estimate data</a> that would put a 65+ with 10 problems at around a 34.38% chance of death whereas an 18-49 year old without health conditions would have a roughly 0.05% chance of death.</p>
<p>Pretty obvious findings of course but gives more substantial context to the actual risks.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20210419/more-exercise-lowers-risk-of-severe-covid-19-study">There was a study that showed that being inactive was the biggest confounding factor in coronavirus deaths, being even worse than smoking or having other diseases.</a></p>
<p>&rt; Compared with the most active people in the study — those who exercised 150 minutes or more every week — patients with COVID-19 who were "consistently inactive" were 226% more likely to be hospitalized, 173% more likely to be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and 149% more likely to die. </p>
<p>&rt; "The magnitude of risk for all outcomes associated with <strong>being consistently inactive exceeded the odds of smoking and virtually all the chronic diseases studied in this analysis</strong>," the researchers add. This finding could indicate that "physical inactivity may play a crucial role as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 outcomes."</p>
