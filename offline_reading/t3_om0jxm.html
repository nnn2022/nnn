    <strong>Vaccinated person here, trying to see both sides of the vaccine argument. For you personally, why are you opposed to the vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>Hey all! As someone who is for the COVID vaccines, I was just wondering why you’re against it. I always try and get multiple sides of a story, so here I am! Hopefully we can have a (respectful) discussion!</p>
<p>Edit: I’m getting a lot of replies so apologies if I don’t get to you!</p>
<p>Edit 2: Thanks so much to everyone who replied!! I learned a lot today and I really appreciate you guys taking time out of your day :) I’m going to take a break because I need to go to bed (it’s 2am lmao), but once again thanks, it was fun seeing all of the different thoughts everyone had.</p>
<p>Edit 3 (final one I swear): It's been almost a full day since I posted this, and I think my original goal for this post has been accomplished! I got a lot of comments all with very good points and I like to think I learned something here. I'm still sticking with my stance, but don't take it personally, I'm very close minded. But don't think your comments have gone to waste, I read every single word and article posted in this thread. Thanks summer. Anyways, thanks so much everyone again, for letting me see the other side of this argument without being downvoted into oblivion too badly. Have a nice day if you're reading this :) I'll try and still read everything but I have things to do tomorrow. Have a nice day if you're reading this</p></p>

        <p>First of all, these shots don’t meet the traditional requirements of a vaccine; providing immunity and preventing transmission. </p>
<p>Second of all, this is the first time in history that we’ve injected the public with mRNA medical technology, as previous attempts never made it past animal trials. </p>
<p>Clinical trials won’t be completed until 2023. Until then, we don’t know whether the shot is safe and effective or not. </p>
<p>Additionally, medical professionals who state anything contrary to the government and mainstream media’s views are censored. As long as that happens, I will not even consider getting the shot.</p>

        <p>Don’t forget the suppression of viable treatment options such as ivermectin, causing huge amounts of deaths that were otherwise avoidable. And that stinks extra bad when the only way to have an EUA is without and alternative Treatment available. That’s a huge red flag, amongst many many others.</p>

        <p>Wait, the entire point of an mRNA vaccine is that it essentially gives your cells instructions to build a harmless protein that our bodies fight, and then yay we know how to fight COVID. Wouldn’t that provide immunity?</p>
<p>The vaccine was tested normally as any other vaccine would be, and although this is the first mRNA vaccine, testing and research about it has been going on for decades. (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html) </p>
<p>I cannot find anything about trials going on until 2023, do you happen to have a source?  Same goes for censorship.</p>

        <p>No worries, but honestly, this is just the tip of the amount of information out there. I have not cataloged everything properly yet, but the evidence for a proper risk to benefit analysis is staggering to say the least. Censorship is obvious on how quickly papers are deleted, despite solid peer review oftentimes, or just making sure the public never comes across it (eg: no publicity).</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7846902/">I would like to add this modern study</a></p>

<p>There's more details about the dangers of mRNA inoculation tech in people with auto-immune disorders, under the header titled "Nucleic acid".

        <p>Was wondering what your thoughts on the Nova Vax vaccine is? A lot of what I read about it seems much better than the gene therapy ones. Mainly because I know it’s made from plants and more like a traditional kind of vaccine. Waiting for the data obviously I don’t know everything, but you seem very well educated on this subject which is awesome, so I figured I would ask if you’ve done any research/have opinions on that vax greatly appreciated in advance if you reply to me</p>

        <p>Well without looking at the data itself for Novavax, we can see its a recombinant vaccine, using a Baculovirus containing the spike protein. As I pointed out in the studies earlier, we now know the spike protein to be harmful to the body, its mechanisms of damage to the cells is understood, so I would exercise caution with any drug containing or using the spike protein. I would personally like to see the biodistribution, genotoxicity, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies for the Novavax drug to make any more comment on how that protein interacts within the body and the cells. </p>
<p>The clinical trials (phase 1 and 2) finish November this year (<a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04368988">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04368988</a>) so after that we can hopefully look at the data. Its worth noting that less than 1500 participants are in the trial, which is not ideal.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><em>I'll also just copy paste this quick comment as well in regards to risk-benefit analysis:</em></p>
<p>And as with taking any drug, a risk-benefit analysis is needed. Medications are given to sick people to treat disease. Vaccines are given to healthy people to prevent an
 infection. Therefore a consideration of risk-benefit analysis is paramount.  </p>
<p>We first look at the disease itself, and it must be understood how 'deadly' the disease is. After the odd 18 months, we have a pretty good idea.   </p>
<p>Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) stats based on seroprevalence antibody studies are inflated <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.21.108308v1">since
 T-cell immunity, is not measured in these studies</a>. This may result in a 3-5X lower IFR for Covid. Regardless, the
 general IFR is on order of the seasonal influenza, <strong><em>approx. 0.2%</em></strong> (a collection of dozens of studies and reports can
 be found <a href="https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/"><strong>HERE</strong></a>. An update on WHO’s bulletin can also be found <a href="https://www.who.int/bulletin/online_first/BLT.20.265892.pdf"><strong>HERE</strong></a>).</p>
<p>Next is transmission. None of the vaccine candidates so far (whether Mrna, viralvector, or protein based) have shown a reduction of transmission, merely a reduction of symptoms. According to the data, and elaborated by Tal Zaks (CMO of Moderna) the trials are not designed to demonstrate
 a reduction in transmission, due to “operational realities”. </p>
<p>So my advice for anyone, is to look at your specific age profile, see the risk of the disease, then what benefits you receive from the drug, taking into account its short and long term risks and effects, and then make the judgement based on that.</p>

<p>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0249499</p>
<p>Key takeaways:</p>
<p>- Your immune system is your best defence against SARS-CoV-2, and indeed all coronaviruses.</p>
<p>- If you have been infected, even if you experienced no symptoms at all, you are immune to all variants.</p>
<p>- We have already reached herd immunity.</p>
<p>And to add to Mrna vaccine mechanisms, looking at antibodies: </p>

<p>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.06.005 (third IgG response to vaccine paper)</p>
<p>And to give you a quick rundown of those above 2 studies in easy to understand manner:</p>
<p>(<br>
Spike protein  enters to cell wall of blood vessels&rt; Lymphocytes then attack those cells (leading to clot formation)&rt; With subsequent vaccine shots, antibody levels increase dramatically, which attach to spike protein sticking out of cell wall, which then leads to Leukocytes attacking them as well.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, it turns out the spike protein is <em>not</em> harmless. It damages cells on its own. Nor can it trigger the same kind of immunity that natural infection, or even a whole virus vaccine, could, because with exposure to the virus itself, you develop antibodies and T-cells against several different parts of the virus including but not limited to the spike protein. So if the virus mutates and the new strain's protein is different, your body still recognizes it as an invader it's seen before and produces antibodies against it.</p>

        <p>Are you aware that the initial inventor of mRNA technology (Dr. Robert Malone) has been outspoken on the dangers of the vaccines. Two main issues (both proven): (1) The area affected was supposed to be local (i.e. injection site) but instead cells throughout your body are being altered, with an especial concentration of the lipids carrying the 'building instructions' happening in the ovaries of women. (2) The spike protein was supposed to stay anchored to these cells but it instead breaks loose and travels through the blood stream and can pass the blood brain barrier. What this means is that build up of these spikes and the bodies reaction to them, can cause major and quite varied side effects throughout the body. Short-term side effects are much worse and much more widespread that the vaccine companies expected. Long-term side-effects are unknown.</p>
<p>Dr. Luc Montagnier, a Nobel Prize winning virologist,  believes Covid vaccines may be extremely dangerous for huge numbers of people in the long-term. Michael Yeadon, the former Chief Science Officer for Respiratory Research at Pfizer, has claimed that the drug companies cannot be trusted and what they are currently doing is very dangerous. Dr. Geert Vanden Bossche, a virologist, and former member of GAVI (the vaccine alliance)  believes the Covid vaccines could be very dangerous to any natural immunity and alternative treatments should be used.</p>
<p>There are many other specialists who are extremely concerned at the dangers the vaccines may cause, especially long-term, and because no proper trials were conducted all we can do is wait and hope it won't be as bad as some quite intelligent and very well-educated people believe it will be.</p>

        <p>Are you suggesting that without the vaccine our bodies couldn't possible know how to fight COVID? What about like the 98-99% of people that recovered before they even put out the vaccines? </p>
<p>In your second point, you're not really refuting his point, just restating it while conveniently leaving out a particular scenario. Yes, testing and research about it has been going on for decades, and showing critical results with animal trials. </p>
<p>All the vaccines are not fully FDA approved, it's for emergency use only. I can't link you to the 2023 clinical trial ending as I'm on my phone but I'm 100% sure I've read it on reputable news/gov website. - /someone linked these already, thanks.</p>

        <p>I'd like to add to this, a lot of us have gotten hate from people we really trusted, not just from internet strangers.  We've really been worn down to a vulnerable and reactive state of mind.</p>

        <p>Sadly, yes. The ways the hatred has spilled over into our real world has been heartbreaking. My partner and I are fortunate to have a solid support system of people who love us even when we disagree, but it has been crazy to experience the rifts in our very trusted relationships due to our differences in processing and reacting to Covid stuff. I say stuff because the last 16+ months are hard to define.</p>

        <p>Because I’m not here to argue, if I address points that’s what happens normally. I’ve come to terms I’m not gonna change my mind on anything so it’s not really worth it anymore. Not that your guy’s points aren’t wrong obviously, it was very interesting to see what everyone had to say, and I definitely learned a lot of stuff. It was a fun way to spend all night awake.</p>
<p>Also I like to argue a lot when I’m tired, but when I’m tired I drop around 30 iq points. It’s the closest thing to getting drunk and then texting your ex that I can do considering I can’t drink and I don’t date lmao.</p>

        <p>Yep, I’m not open minded at all. Bad habit. For me personally (and this is probably just me because I’m weird) I think it always helps to see all sides of something even if you don’t agree with it fully. Keyword is fully there. Although I didn’t change my mind on it as a whole, I learned a lot of things and I’m thankful I did this no matter what. I read all 100 some comment and will keep doing so for a while, if that make you feel any better. Once again you can have your opinion about me, and it’s not gonna be the end of the world. Just making my case.</p>

        <p>I can’t help but feel like you are more open minded than you give yourself credit for. This random late night interest came from curiosity. That in itself shows you are open minded enough to engage in discord with people you have made your mind up about. Hopefully with time you will grow space to start re-evaluating your firmly held beliefs. Not because they are wrong, but because it is super important to do that on a regular basis. Everything is impermanent, including opinions and beliefs. We didn’t change your mind, but seeds of growth for all of us were planted, and that matters. A lot.  :)</p>

        <p>Good question! The basic answer is that I am a kid who had absolutely no idea this many people were opposing the vaccine when I got it a couple months ago. I think I still would’ve gotten it even if I did know though. I was confident in it and still am pretty confident now about my choice I’d say. Even if it’s overkill and I could’ve gotten a bad side effect my family’s situation was really bad with covid so I think it gave me a nice sense of closure.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry your question comment got downbooted to oblivion:/ This community is filled with a lot of different people coming from a lot of different perspectives, but one thing we have in common is that we’ve all experienced virtual and real life bullying to a point that is new to many of us.  Because of that some of our defense mechanisms are bigger than others. I don’t want to speak for everyone in here, but I sincerely appreciate your post and your further questions. I am similar to you in the way that I appreciate hearing others thoughts and opinions even when I disagree :) thanks for being here and giving us a chance.</p>

<p>The vaccines were rushed through EUAs so, no, they haven't been tested normally as any other vaccine would be. </p>
<p>There is also no evidence they stop transmission.</p>
<p>The corporations pushing the vaccines have no idea if they actually work to nullify the virus, yet continually insist they are safe and effective.</p>
<p>The 'experts' have no idea how long immunity lasts (which could have been analysed if they were tested properly "as any other vaccine would be").</p>
<p>The vaccines are still in test and this is proven by the lack of real data on if they work or how well they work and this is communicated daily by the media.</p>
<p>The WHO changed the definition of 'vaccine' (again) to ensure this experimental shit would fit the description.</p>
<p>The CDC stopped recording breakthrough cases in the vaccinated, only deaths, but also advised the deaths also don't really count because they were mostly old people with comorbidities (Seem eerily familiar)</p>
<p>Leaky vaccines (that only stop strong symptoms but fail to protect against contraction and transmission) have not gone well in the past.</p>

        <p>The mRNA vaccines only create a very small part of the virus and usually only in very limited variations. The problem with mRNA vaccines is that the antibody response is too narrow and antibody escape is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>I believe the media and pharma companies will blame the unvaccinated for this soon enough, but the thing is. The virus is zoonotic, so unless you plan on vaccinating all host species, this is bound to happen eventually as antibody levels drop after the pandemic.</p>

        <p>If you can’t see the censorship your not paying attention to anything at all, the spike protein is dangerous and accumulates in bone marrow and ovaries.  Vaccinating in the midst of pandemic causes massive upward pressure on mutations, that’s why all the mutants have changes to the spike protein. You’ve been duped man.</p>

        <p>Not necessarily against it, just am young, healthy, and unafraid of a virus with a stupidly high survival rate. If you wanna take it, feel free, I don't mind. Just don't force it upon me.</p>
<p>Also, if it's as safe and effective as advertised, I don't really see the need for essentially any restrictions any longer. The world's been fucked up for too long, already.</p>

        <p>Fair enough, but what’s the harm in just getting the jab then? Also, I think countries aren’t reopening because there’s still a lot of people not vaccinated (like in the states around 50 percent of people aren’t vaccinated yet).</p>

        <p>Because it's one of many, many things that I don't do just for shits and giggles. I'm highly low-risk, and would much rather just sit back and see what happens with it, considering it's different than any other vaccine in history and no one truly knows what the long-term effects of it will be, if any. Again, not against the vaccine, and I do think it works well. Just I'd rather not even take the risk, just so I can be slightly more safe from a mild illness. Life is more or less back to normal in most states, including mine. I really don't have any need whatsoever to get the vaccine. More for others, right?</p>
<p>Depends on the country. But the common denominator in all the shut-down countries is the government going out of their way to impose mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns that have done more harm than good at this point. Turns out politicians also love an excuse for a power grab and tend to not like giving it up.</p>

        <p>From what I understand, there's an inverse relationship between risk from the virus and risk from the vaccine-- the less at risk from the actual virus you are, the more likely you are to have adverse reactions.  The younger and healthier the person, the less likely it is that they should get the shot.</p>

        <p>The censorship alone should be a red flag, the second red flag should be all of the side effects and health issues that are being discovered on a daily basis and should be a cause for concern. Thirdly, I would say for me it’s the EUA and the lack of any liability from the manufacturers. I am not a disease expert or a doctor, that is why I have spent the past year and a half educating myself and listening to the doctors and experts who ask the hard questions and can see that something is not right here.</p>

They did fuck all during the opioid epidemic, in which pharma companies and doctors made massive profits killing people with hard drugs. During the initial spread of Covid they told people not to wear masks. They've never told people to wear masks that actually work (N95). The "pandemic" is lab-made, overhyped nonsense.</p>

        <p>They actually made companies stop selling N-95 masks to provide them to front line workers only to wind up finding out they are too costly to be practical because they are thrown away after 1 use so they are in stockpiles and the companies producing them in the US still can’t get rid of them. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/25/1009858893/u-s-companies-shifted-to-make-n95-respirators-during-covid-now-theyre-struggling">N-95 Stockplie</a>

        <p>The excuse for the Emergency Use Authorization for the covaxxes is the fearsome "covid pandemic" "emergency". But funnily enough since covid is easily treatable with HCQ, zinc, ivermectin &amp;c, there's not really any emergency. Also if you look at overall mortality rates for 2019, 2020, global death rates are maybe just a tad above seasonal flu. No emergency. Ergo, no need for EUA.<br>
Safe and effective? Since the covaxxes skipped safety trials, we can't say they are safe. In fact, since VAERS show covaxx deaths now surpass ALL other vaccine deaths cumulatively since the very start of VAERS reporting(!), we can confidently say that covaxxes are UNsafe. Now as to effective: as stated, a person who has gotten covaxx can still be infected with covid, and can still transmit covid. Covaxxes are not effecctive vaccines.<br>
Back to "safe". Given the stated depopulation goals of certain folks, I am suspicious of the purpose of the 'vaccines'. [See Georgia Guidestones] As it happens, I'm still enjoying life.<br>
As you have probably noticed, vaccines are a highly politicized issue, with much misinformation published. Discernment required!</p>

        <p>Basically, yes. From what I can find (I could be wrong) it seems that all deaths need to be reported, regardless of the reporter thinks the vaccine caused the death or adverse reaction. So like you could get run over by a car the day after you got the vaccine and that might be reported (https://www.nebraskamed.com/COVID/does-vaers-list-deaths-caused-by-covid-19-vaccines)</p>

<p>You mean like how they have been reporting C19 deaths as being anything from dying 0 - 60 days after a positive PCR test? Sounds very consistent to me. Why not do that?

<p>&rt;it seems that all deaths need to be reported, regardless of the reporter thinks the vaccine caused the death or adverse reaction.</p>
<p>You mean EXACTLY like how the CDC told the coroners and first responders to code C19 deaths without going through the hassle of conducting a test/autopsy? A simple assumption was all that was required.</p>

        <p>If you are telling me that you don't see how the NY state calling ALL causes of death within 60 days of a positive PCR test result a "C19 death stat" is IDENTICAL to your criticism of the VAERS that " So like you could get run over by a car the day after you got the vaccine and that might be reported," then you are being deliberately obtuse and do not want to discuss this in good faith.</p>

        <p>It is simply not true. They haven't got through normal safety tests cause it took about 10 years for vaccine (and other medicines) to be accepted. Not kind or type of medicine, but specific medicine. And no, at best they were worked on since SARS so 18 years. And were never accepted by ANY agency and never left closed laboraotry tests. Until now.</p>

        <p>I keep hearing this too, from people in the 30s bracket, telling younger people (keep in mind, the older people got it) not to get it. The people I know in their 30s are still having symptoms, after getting their shot, like ~1-2 month later.</p>
<p>It’s interesting too how ~12 and under don’t have a shot ready for them yet, but every bracket so far does, and younger demographic is being more affected (heart problems, etc.) That isn’t normal symptoms from a vaccine, nor for kids.</p>

        <p>Think about it. Why does the public need to be convinced that a virus is super deadly and that they should take a miracle cure? Likely because neither are true. I don't need a chance to win a million dollars to convince me to take a remedy to cure cancer.</p>

        <p>It is not properly tested and we do not understand the long-term effect of this vaccine. The trials are continuing into 2023 and there are endless reports of very serious mysterious complications after vaccination. I am not afraid at all of the 1/10000000 chance of a blood clot. I am concerned about the reports like this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/olioa8/tw_severe_headache_nonstop_1_month_post_moderna/">https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/olioa8/tw_severe_headache_nonstop_1_month_post_moderna/</a>  popping up every single day. Multiple people agreeing they are experiencing the same symptoms and are getting absolutely no answers/help. these threads are non-stop every single day and nobody has answers. This is not what a vaccine does to people; it is doing things to peoples bodies that we do not understand yet. That should be seriously concerning to everyone.</p>
<p>I believe if you are 60+ or have other conditions that make covid a risk to you then it is probably a good idea to get the vaccine. I do not feel a moral obligation to get it for others since everyone who wants to do so has the opportunity to nearly 100% protection from serious covid complications if they choose. Issues that make it impossible to get any one of the available vaccines are extremely rare and I believe that if that is someone's situation, then they should take responsibility and precautions for their medical condition and not expect the entire world to cater to them.</p>

        <p>Because I’ve had Covid. Why would I inoculate myself for something I’ve already had?</p>
<p>We don’t tell people who’ve had chickenpox to go get the varicella vaccine. We don’t tell people who’ve had measles to get an MMR.  </p>
<p>But the fact that if you get injured the manufacturers of this experiment can’t be held liable — no bueno. </p>
<p>These are also coming from a company that’s paying money in settlement for the opioid crisis (Pfizer) and J&amp;J is now recalling sun screen and they knew that their baby powder was dangerous but didn’t fix it so now people have cancer and lawsuits out the ass. </p>

        <p>These Injections have been proven to reduce symptoms somewhat but our own NHS leaflets and Government statements in the UK state that they have no idea if it reduces transmission or stops you catching Covid-19...
So the introduction of vax passports and medical apartheid is based on what? It is clearly not about health. Getting the injection does not protect others and there are countless reports of vaccinated people still catching Covid-19 so what exactly is the point?</p>
<p>Furthermore Ivermectin has been proven to be cheaper, and far more effective and much safer than any of these Injections... but its use isn't being officially advertised because it destroys the narrative the powers that be are trying to build.</p>
<p>In other words - we are being given lied to</p>

        <p>Mostly because I have looked at the risk of Covid and I’ve looked at the side effects of the vaccine and I’ve decided that I don’t need it. I don’t want to put medication in my body that I don’t need, and at under 30, I’m at basically no risk for Covid, I’m pretty sure I already had it early on, I’m concerned about possible potential risk of fertility, and quite frankly I feel like it’s my personal decision. I do not and will not get medical procedures for other people. I refuse to allow that to make me a bad person. I’m not going to put stuff in my body, putting my body at risk, for someone else, any medical procedure I do specifically to benefit myself. </p>
<p>Also, just anecdotally, the harder they push this the less I want it, and Maybe that just means I’m being contrarian, but they are pushing this so hard, what with all of the advertisements and the free stuff in the constant barrage of “get it, get it, get it,” that it really freaks me out</p>

        <p>I’ve found that this is the main reason why people won’t get it, and I think it’s a respectable decision, even if I don’t agree fully with it. There’s something empowering about people knowing their own bodies I guess. The advertising campaigns are very strange, and I don’t think you should need someone to tell you to get vaccinated, but I must say that was a very good glazed donut.</p>

        <p>If you are not at risk (not morbidly obese, not 70 years old) there is <em>zero</em> reason for you to take any precautions when it comes to this virus. Zero.</p>
<p>Were you worried about the common cold in 2019? Here you go, same thing.</p>
<p>The <em>only</em> reason vaccination for people not at risk makes any sense is if vaccination provided sterilizing immunity. They themselves said it over and over - it does not.</p>
<p>It wouldn't make any sense to vaccinate 30 years old with a tested and proven traditional vaccine over this virus. They've recalled the swine flu vaccine over between 5 and 25 deaths in the US. They're now at 7000 and counting, again just in the US.</p>
<p>If public health was the matter, why would you ever want the general not at risk population vaccinated with a non sterilizing vaccine? Why wouldn't you encourage transmission during summer among the young instead of trying all you can for people <em>not</em> to get natural immunity, thus protecting the at risk for real?</p>
<p>It's because THIS IS NOT ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH AND THIS IS NOT ABOUT A VIRUS</p>

        <p>I'm not afraid from or against all vaccinations. I believe though that benefits and drawbacks (known and unknown) have to be weighted against each other. For me i just don't see that tradeoff working for me here. As an example i also never took a flu shot for the same reasons but am vaxxed against hepB and some few others i won't list here. In the end the vaccination might make you ill, but only in rare cases kill you - as covid itself.</p>
<p>What really frightens and to some point even angers me is the way things are developing in the grander scheme. It's  also a way of fighting for freedom of speech/thought and not subduing to everything.</p>

        <p>I have health issues that begun very young, even before this pandemic happened. The hospital has been very dismissive, I won’t say what it is, but so far it’s already taken a year of my life away. Keep in mind, I am young.</p>
<p>I almost died this year, few months ago, my heart was racing, I couldn’t even make it up a flight of stairs, and I thought I wouldn’t wake up today. I opted not to go to the hospital because the nurses were cruel, and dismissive. I was too weak to even pickup my phone. </p>
<p>Anyways, I had to aim for self treatment, after they gave me a possibility of what it could be, but they aren’t exactly sure, or care. They see a young person, so that’s where they become dismissive. Antibiotics made me much worse.</p>
<p>So, that’s why I have strong hesitancy on not wanting to take it. A lot of women are having complex symptoms, from who I personally know. From being in and out of the hospital, I’ve witnessed women, not one, but a strong multiple age variety, with heart attack symptoms, they were convinced it was a heart attack. But no, it’s cause of their shot.</p>
<p>I haven’t heard of that happening with vaccines before, maybe one person, or two, rarely had a weird reaction but I don’t think so, it’s almost unheard of in many generalized vaccines.</p>
<p>I have issues too with my ovaries, and I heard women already having problems with their periods since taking the shot.</p>
<p>So it’s reasons like that, I’m putting my own health foremost before taking a shot, that was quickly rushed.</p>
<p>People will say, “it’s not rushed” but it absolutely is. I don’t think these vaccines are going to kill people, I don’t think they’re 5 G, or whatever the crap is said on Facebook, I don’t use Facebook, but I still think for a decent (%) of people (not all, or possibly majority) can absolutely be affected down the line, if my hesitancy proves to be correct.</p>
<p>I know one person who wounded in a coma after taking it too, so, these once again fuelled my hesitancy. </p>
<p>I also know people very close to me who HAD, covid, and remained in the same household, but none got sick, and the person who did have it, is fine now, despite being at high risk of damage or fatality yet is fine.</p>
<p>It’s really up to you, if you feel comfortable getting your shot, and doing the best for yourself. Which is the shot, go for it, but for someone like me, I don’t think it’s great at the moment, because I don’t want to open up more can of worms for myself.</p>

        <p>reading through the comments and i’m amazed at your patience and manners when some of the peoples commenting are being pretty rude! anyways here’s my take. </p>
<p>although most of the facts have already been stated in these comments let’s just think critically about the world. there’s a lot of bad people, who would do unspeakable things for money and power, right? now it’s not too out there to assume that many of these people are already in a position of either great power, wealth, or both. call me a crazy conspiracy theorist but there’s just too many weird coincidences about every aspect of the covid-19 “pandemic”.</p>
<p>i’m not a professional by any means, but it first started to seem out of whack when the virus itself came from Wuhan, where a coronavirus has been conducted for many years. i thought it seemed kind of whack how the death count wasn’t really that scary? like if you told me every time i drove there’s only a 99.7% chance id live, i’d still do it every day. and when my uncles mom died of literal old age and the nurses from her home wrote the cause of death as “covid-19” things started to seem really weird, especially considering she had previously had covid, survived it, but wasn’t sick at the time of her death?</p>
<p>now going back to those rich people in power who would do anything to get richer and more powerful, are we really going to think that they won’t do some really messed up shit to us on a global scale? think about how much money amazon made during the “pandemic” when everyone had to stay home. think about all the little stores and shops that were forced to close and will never re open, their business will be going to big brands, big names, the people who are already rich, the ones who already have power. the rich, powerful people who could potentially work together to engineer a fake efing pandemic so they can rake it in. </p>
<p>how’d the covid vaccine get finished so quickly even though gene therapy has been in the research phase of its existence for the last 40 years? ooo maybe it’s because big pharmaceuticals could make trillions of dollars. </p>
<p>why would the governments of the world go along with this? maybe because they’ve all been borrowing copious amounts of money and when an economic collapse is imminent, it’s best to have something to blame rather than telling your citizens “sorry your government is corrupt and we were borrowing money to stuff our own pockets”. </p>
<p>i’m summery i don’t trust governments, i don’t trust big companies, and i especially do not trust people who have something to gain from the covid bs. </p>
<p>i don’t have sources, this was a common sense rant</p>

        <p>The EUA, in my mind, was intended to get shots to those elderly and immune compromised.  The people suffering the most from Covid.  To me, that made sense and having loved ones in those categories I encouraged them to get it as soon as they were eligible.  What I did not anticipate was a campaign to continually broaden the scope so that now children of 12 and up are being encouraged to get this.  Pair that with all the lotteries and incentives, for something that has only been administered (on a broad scale) for around seven months?  I’m open minded to one day it being part of the vaccine protocols - of which I support wholeheartedly - but I believe we went into this on a wide scale too quickly and I need more information and more time.</p>

        <p>I'm not against the vaccine, but I also will not be getting it. Having it out there as an option for people is great,  and if after weighing the risks of taking it vs not taking it someone decides to "get the jab" then good for them. If they decide not to,  then good for them. The bottom line is it's a private,  personal medical decision that is none of my (or your) business. </p>
<p>The problem I have is when people are forced to get this or any other vaccine when they don't want it. The safety or efficacy of the vaccine is completely irrelevant, as is the danger (real or imaginary) of whatever virus the vaccine is supposed to protect you against. My body is mine and no one else's, and no one should have a say as to what does or does not go in it other than me. To use coercion, the threat of violence, to force people to do something is inherently immoral and wrong regardless of how good the intentions are.</p>

        <p>Well there is several reasons for me.</p>
<p>First of all past SARS vaccines all turned out to cause more harm than good. Specifically with so called Antibody-dependent Enhancement.</p>
<p>For mRNA vaccines, disturbing side effects have already been discovered. Also I honestly do not believe they offer good protection, but rather they will quickly cause natural selection for strains that have mutations on the Receptor Binding Domain. </p>
<p>In short mass vaxxing for SARS-2 coronavirus could quickly turn out to be the scientifically equivalent of keeping warm by pissing your pants in a snow storm.</p>
<p>Also &lt;0.5% death rate for my age group.</p>

        <p>You seem like a nice person, but I’m confused by you. You clearly never did any research prior to taking the shot and lower down in this thread you mention how you already made up your mind about this whole thing and people dropping information here is doing nothing for you nor did you really want your mind changed anyways. That’s like being raised only reading the Bible and making up your mind dinosaurs never existed and when people show you overwhelming evidence and fossils and hundreds of papers you say “Thanks for the info but I already made up my mind,” despite never knowing there was evidence prior to that. Had you come here with an open mind, asked questions, and still decided you feel the same way you did when you came in that’s cool; but I don’t understand what your point was of coming here if you had no desire to truly see another side.</p>

        <p>I agree. Im extremely close minded and prideful to a fault and it’s a bad habit I cannot seem to shake. I try my best but I’m not very good at fixing things in my life. I feel like I came in here knowing that my stance on the covid vaccine as a whole wouldn’t change, but I just wanted to see what others thought. But, I did learn a lot of things and I’m still reading what everyone has posted, so all this information isn’t going nowhere luckily. Everyone is making very good points, and I have more respect for everyone here. Most of Reddit makes you guys out to be really bad people, but everyone here is nice and well spoken on these topics. I’ve gained a lot of info and a newfound respect of a community at the very least, and probably more.</p>
<p>Side note: I probably (definitely) should’ve done more research beforehand, but in my mind it would’ve been easier to have you guys point me in the right direction and then go from there. That’s been my philosophy on Reddit for years now but then I realized I don’t normally ask about serious topics</p>

        <p>Honestly the only thing I’m opposed to truly is  the pressure around it. I work in media and I’ve had to read up on a lot of things going on since like last year before COVID even got to the US. I just extensively read up on stuff and I saw a bunch of legitimate doctors be censored. Now there’s a bunch of pushing of the vax with ads, celebrities, social media, free stuff and every cell in my body tells me it’s wrong. Plus my boyfriend was mandated to do it for work when he didn’t want to, and I took him to the ER three days later with chest pains and a numb left arm, he had a pretty bad immune disorder growing up.</p>

        <p>Thanks for your kind manners! :)</p>
<p>I am not completely against this vaccine: for now, I can't get it for my health condition so I'm trying to read many things.</p>
<p>Personally I am very skeptical because I just think that in every medicine there are risks, little risks maybe, but still risks.. So it's important that everyone can choose with no pressing on work, schools and from mass media... And no limitations in their life. Everyone must choose for their own body and there always should exist alternatives - no discrimination at all. </p>
<p>And in my opinion the discussion in mass media is not equal because there are many doctors and people of science that are skeptical but the biggest newspapers and information channels don't give space to all options and different point of view.. And I think this could be, in the future, a risk for freedom of all of us.</p>
<p>So I think that the problem is not the vaccine, but the non-correct way of discussion promoted by mass media... This is not helping people and society in this difficult situation; the discussion is not easy and should not be such unilateral in "official debate".</p>
<p>I hope it's clear... I don't usually speak English :D</p>

        <p>First of all, despite the caricature that most other subs try to paint of this group, I think you’ll notice that we’re actually happy to have honest discussion with someone respectful, rather than coming into troll. So welcome in and appreciate your question. </p>
<p>I think your question shows some assumptions on our position regarding being monolithically against the vaccine.  You’ll find out that the majority of us aren’t anti-vaccine at all. More like if you want it, great, if you don’t want it, that’s cool too. </p>
<p>Obviously I can’t speak for all, but I’m not anti-vaccine, I’m pro-choice. Why should the vaxxed care if non-vax choose not to? By now if you want to be protected, you are. </p>
<p>My problem is with forced vaccination through coercion. CNN’s medical “expert” Leana Wen suggests authoritarian coercion “make life hard for (the unvaxxed)”. </p>
<p>No government policy can cover the needs of all and that’s why personal choice is important. On average of the entire population, it may be true that the vaccine is less risky than the disease. But when you start to factor in the unknown about the vaccine and segment risk by age groups, I do think there may be a risk inversion for young people, specifically young children (who we all know will be next on the governments agenda with something like “THETA VARIANT SPECIFICALLY TARGETING <em>INSERT NEXT AGE RANGE WERE TRYING TO APPROVE FOR VACCINATION</em>”)). </p>
<p>My toddler has as close to scientifically zero chance of dying from COVID. They won’t be getting the vaccine, end of story, full stop. I would allow 10+ 85 year old grandmas die before I would put a single young child at risk who could have 80+ years of remaining life at risk. I think it’s abhorrently selfish and a reflection of the disproportionately elderly in power. </p>
<p>I’m also skeptical because of all the censorship. You literally got removed from social media for saying anything like “hey maybe I came from that lab in Wuhan that plays with Coronaviruses, and maybe not from some bat soup market located 100 yards away”.  But now you’re allowed to say it because the government and social media overlords now say it’s okay?</p>
<p>Another point of skepticism is that all we’ve heard about COVID is you get it, and you die. Very interesting that there has been near zero guidance on how to treat infection for something that what, 100M US citizens have had? It’s as lousy as teaching abstinence only sex education. </p>
<p>How about the suppressed information on natural immunity? Cleveland Clinic posted a study that indicated natural immunity is as good, or stronger and longer lasting than this eternal vaccination booster path that big pharma want$ us to go down. And their study isn’t crazy, it’s in line with all conventional wisdom we have about this type of viral immunity. I’ve already had COVID, survived, recovered, and I’m not getting a vaccine just so I can circle jerk on social media and so that the government can check my box. </p>
<p>On top of that, this is new vaccine technology, which I like new tech, but not forced experiments. If mRNA turns out to be safe and effective and valuable in the future, that’s awesome. In the meantime I find it fishy that all the bad press has come around traditional viral vector vaccines (J&amp;J and AstraZeneca), but you can’t say a negative word about the mRNA type without being censored. </p>
<p>Plenty more thoughts, but since you came in respectfully figured I’d give you some of my thoughts. Thanks for stopping by.</p>

        <p>For me personally, the bottom line is that I ALWAYS have side effects to any medicine or procedure, typically weird and unusual ones and have great results from things that are outside of normal medical practice.  Here's some examples:<br>
--Gabapentin to deal with chronic pain caused blackouts and erratic behavior along with weight gain.  Using medicinal marijuana, massage therapy, personal training, and even intermittent fasting worked without side effects-- and in fact with fringe benefits.  Why should I trust the industry that pushes gabapentin instead of the things that work?<br>
--I was pressured heavily into getting LASIK when I went in for a "free consultation" and basically lost a year of my life recovering from that experience.  </p>
<p>As soon as I read what the risks were for *my specific age group* etc, for both covid itself and the vaccine, I decided that although neither option is good, there's a high chance I already have natural immunity from prior infection and I can lower my risk of severe covid effects by getting in shape... so it's not far off from the gabapentin vs natural treatments choice.  I can just fast and work out and do things to naturally boost my health and make myself more able to survive the virus in the wild instead of taking the risks associated with the vaccine.  </p>
<p>As for the "what about other people" argument, the same argument in regards to masks and distancing have turned me from an empath to someone who only gives a shit about a small handful of people because I got tired of having my empathy weaponized against me.  Literally all I could do with that argument was start owning the idea of being misanthropic and selfish.</p>

        <p>Im not against vaccine es at all but this isn't a vaccine. I did what was asked got one jab won't be taking the second. I got really sick two days after with tremors jerking muscle twitches vomiting headaches muscle weakness, nerve pain burning tingling numbness sluring drooling high bp. I'm embarrassed to even hold a conversation with anyone because I forget what I'm talking about and my mind goes blank, lots of memory issues. This has been an ongoing thing since may 24, spent 10 days in hospital I'm still not well. </p>
<p>It is experimental drs don't know what to look out for or can't speak up. We have no idea how this is going to affect the world in the long term. It's still in the trial phase. I fear there's more bad to come. I'm most fearful about what it will do to our children now and later.</p>

        <p>The fact that we are censored from going to any other site and asking any question about it definitely factors in. You have a freedom that we are denied. A freedom that’s guaranteed by our constitution in the US. I originally intended to watch the stats and make an informed decision after some feedback from these trials was reported but the Vaers reports of over 10,000 deaths, the trillion dollar marketing campaign and the media and social media censorship made it pretty easy to decide.</p>

        <p>I’m not anti vaccine.  I’ve had hundreds of doses of various vaccines throughout my life.  But I’m also a skeptic.  It alarms me how hard they are pushing this vaccine which was rushed to production and still doesn’t have full FDA approval.  It also alarms me the amount of censorship in trying to silence those medical experts who have reservations about the vaccines and their side effects.</p>

        <p>Every single vaccine had potentially bad side effects like every single medicine. They just added GBS to list.  Yet they have zero liability. I have a problem with the manufacturers: they have being found guilty of fraudulent marketing of their products several times, killing people as a result then fined in the billion$$ to cover their fatalities and still make a profit. The doctors: who coerce people to take the shot them brush off their side effects and leave them untreated and to fend for themselves. And the persistence of our governments to reward the “brave” ones with donuts, burgers, alcohol etc. No promotion actual health, just pure propaganda and coercion.   I also believe that we see more side effects with this vaccines than the rest because the recipients are teens and adults who can verbalize how the feel afterwards. Baby’s reactions get brushed off because all they can do is cry when they feel sick and or in pain.  They even have normalize babies having febril seizures after inoculation.  Most people don’t think about any of this unless personally affected (and that’s how I landed on skeptic land myself unfortunately:( ).</p>

        <p>Early on view:  I am in my 40s with zero risk factors. I would rather have my T Cells and potential subsequent antibodies fight a virus as opposed to mRNA tech that may or not cause long term effects. </p>
<p>Current view: the constant shoving it down our throats because “it’s for the greater good” is infuriating. People being shamed and called selfish because they want to rely on their own immune system is insane. They are spending billions of dollars in marketing for an experimental mRNA shot and telling healthy people that they are killing other people. Lunacy. I am perfectly healthy - not an asymptomatic spreader. Big difference. Now I am declining it out of sheer principle at this point.</p>

        <p>I am against wasteful spending and medical overtreatment. Vaccinating people not facing significant risk is insane. People say it helps slow spread but the truth is we don't know if it does and we don't know if that's even a good thing. For all we know mass vaccination can be a driver of viral mutation by creating a very specific selection pressure (spike protein based immune response). Therefore mass vaccination could very well be causing more frequent or stronger viral spikes which could lead to more deaths. We are playing games with nature and historically we aren't very good at it. </p>

        <p>Many folks, me included, never bought in to the idea of "once we have a vaccine everyone can get it and then we can go back to normal." Never, we never thought that. I think that's a big difference that some folks aren't able to imagine. If you've been thinking that for months, pinning everything on that, and assuming most people feel the same way, then it's gonna be shocking when millions say no thanks to the vaccine. Millions never bought in to that idea for a variety of reasons. My main ones are "this virus was never as dangerous as the news says," "the government absolutely should not have the power to tell me what to do with my own body," and "if older folks at risk want to take more precautions like staying away from crowds or taking medicines, more power to em." I didn't think the vaccine would have the side effects it's having, and for me more than that being the big reason not to get it, it just shows the extreme censorship and creepy lack of discussion going on.</p>

        <p>Backtrack to September 2019. The global financial system began seriously breaking down in a way that would legitimately risk a global dark ages. Then a few months later the covid narrative shows up. The financial crisis aside, NONE of the narrative made any sense to me. So I began digging deep while the entire world economy got locked down. It made me realize that something of biblical proportions was going on, so I kept digging. The more I dug the more time passed and the covid narrative kept shifting and contradicting itself. This caught my attention so I began researching that and realized I didn't want to take that risk, especially since everything with the covid narrative and timeline is dancing in absolutely perfect lockstep with historical economic collapse. This was further confirmed by currencies around the world like Venezuelan Bolivar hyperinflating while mass riots and civil unrest tear apart countries from the inside, like South Africa.</p>

Then as more and more info became available, the whole thing just didnt feel right. Now almost daily, my decision is confirmed by 1) the actions of the government, 2) some citizens and 3) actual facts regarding the efficacy of the vaccine itself.</p>

        <p>Thanks for having a discussion about this! </p>
<p>A few reasons: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I am a healthy, 25 year old who works out every say, eats clean, drinks water and gets enough sleep. I hardly ever get sick to start out with. There is an almost non-existent risk that I would actually die from covid. The focus should continue to stay on elderly + people with pre-existing conditions. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know two healthy young people who have died after their second shot. Which is two more than I know of people who have died from covid. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The shot has emergency-authorization, not FDA approval. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There’s no long-term studies of the effects of the shot. Less than 1 year of data should not be considered long-term. Also, who knows how this effects women vs men. Most medical studies only test men. I’d rather risk getting actual covid than putting something in my body that could drastically effect me long-term. I’ve heard numerous cases about women’s menstrual cycles changing after the shots - this seems super sketchy to me. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can still get covid even after getting the shot - why risk a test vaccine for something that you could still again again? Especially when it’s a small percentage of people who might actually die from covid. Yes, I know there have been an unfortunate amount of deaths, but where is the data about how many have died with pre-existing conditions like obesity, cancer, heart disease, etc. Let’s see who’s died WITH covid. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heart disease is still the #1 killer - where’s the concern for that? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The propaganda - where else do you see businesses and government giving out treats and money for taking a shot? Even the celebrity endorsements feel gross. The media is censoring anyone with different views. How is that ethical? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There has been ZERO focus on overall well-being - in fact, people are given the opposite: donuts for shots, closing gyms, isolating people, etc. how about the government rewards people for exercising, eating healthy, etc. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The companies launching these shots have NUMEROUS law suits against them for other products and adverse health issues defects - who’s to say they didn’t fuck up with these shots? </p>
</li>

<p>When did people decide the government and big pharma are looking out for their best interest and not profits? </p>

        <p>I think for any healthy person under 50 the vaccine was more important as a placebo to stop being afraid than as an actual vaccine. I almost certainly had COVID, I’m not afraid of it and never was, the side effects are ROUGH, and the TPTB keep dismissing any side effects (like myocarditis in young men, blood clots in young women, menstrual cycle issues, GBD) as nothing.</p>
<p>Also pure spite. I never agreed to lockdown society for a year and a half to get a vaccine for something I don’t need. It’s a hugely dangerous precedent.</p>
<p>Also as others have said, I want to wait to see if the ADE issue really got solved. Every other coronavirus vaccine has failed in the animal trials due to ADE issues.</p>

        <p>Fully vaccinated here. It goes against the most basic of medical ethics to coerce people into receiving it under threat of living like a second class citizen. I also wonder why they went straight into using a mRNA based delivery system instead of the usual live-attenuated route despite the former never being previously being widely used in humans. I was just forced to by my employer.</p>

        <p>I'm not opposed to the vaccine. I agree with Joe bidens statement during his campaign, the people deserve absolute 100% transparency about everything concerning a new vaccine and if they don't have it, they can't be expected to take it on faith.</p>

        <p>Vaccine first dose nearly killed both my parents. They were tested &amp; never, at any point in time, had Covid antibodies, so it was the vax. My mother has permanent lung damage, &amp; my father lost a dangerous amount of weight &amp; still hasn’t recovered.  I feel like my government stole time off of my parents’ lives, because this will almost certainly shorten their lifespans. </p>
<p>Also, just making comments anywhere on Reddit implying (not stating) that people shouldn’t have to take a dangerous, untested injection with multiple recorded fatalities gets me death threats. The vaxx-pusher crowd is not friendly or tolerant in any way, shape, or form, &amp; they have no sympathy for anyone who doesn’t toe the line.</p>

        <p>I don’t need it.  I’m 27 years old and in very good health.  I exercise daily and eat a high quality, balanced diet.  Don’t smoke, don’t drink.  My experience is also colored because I don’t ever get any annual flu vaccines.  I haven’t had more than a mild cold in at least 15 years.  Every annual doctor’s check up is just more proof to me that I’m doing just fine.  Heck, I work remotely and left my locked down city up north (Chicago) in order to move to florida as soon as the pandemic started.  I’ve been going out to eat at sit down restaurants, flying back and forth to Chicago, going to parks/beaches, gyms daily.  Still have yet to get noticeably sick.  At this point; I’d find it hard to believe that I haven’t had Covid.  I just don’t see it as a threat to me.  And if it does get me, I’m ok with dying.    As simple as that</p>

        <p>Are you only on your first shot or both shots? I hope for your sake that you were one of the blessed ones. I know people in both camps. Please, if you know anyone who is pregnant, tell them to wait until after they have their child to vaccinate. Greatest tragedy I have witnessed so far was a miscarriage at 7 months due to thrombocytopenia, blood clotting in the umbilical cord that caused a brain hemorrhage in the baby.</p>

        <p>Thx for reaching out and entering a discussion.</p>
<p>Purely statistically speaking, Covid doesn't pose high enough of a risk to me while vaccines pose too much of a risk to me. But it's not a stark difference, currently I'm 40-60 in favor of the vaccines.</p>
<p>Another big part of my decision is that I'm being coerced by my government to get the vaccine (and soon perhaps even persecuted if I don't). If the vaccine was simply offered to me with no strings attached and all information laid open and presented objectively and neutrally (rather than the propaganda that is going on right now--which I hope you see happening as well), I might very well decide to get vaccinated! But there's a principle involved here. If I give into the pressure, what will I agree to next to get my basic freedoms back?</p>

        <p>I’m reluctant to get it because of the governments and corporate censorship of alternative information. I’ve been a big Brett Weinstein fan for some time and he and his wife, both PHDs, have been completely demonetized and issued strikes for discussing ivermectin. </p>
<p>I don’t trust any of the big pharmaceutical companies and I don’t trust the government. This used to be a non controversial statement. I’m of the age now where I was entering adulthood when the US government lied about weapons in Iraq, thus entering a never ending war leading to the creation of Isis. This is also the same government that created a program to spy on its own citizens, a program still in place today despite being overwhelmingly unpopular. The government is not your friend and doesn’t have your best interests at heart. Big corporations are not your friends and don’t have your best interests at heart. I say this as a left leaning person who’s had several vaccines in my lifetime and am in favor of progressing mRNA technology. This vaccine is extremely controversial, authorized for emergency use only, and is being forced upon the population.</p>

        <p>Honestly was interested when I first heard about the vaccine. The more I looked into it the more I realized I didn't need it. 
I'm healthy. Stay active etc.</p>
<p>Then I saw clinical trials with animals dying. Then I looked into how many clinical trials were done and how they were done. Then the coercion...it just became so bizarre to me for lack of a better word.
Then the promises for returning to normal, one lie after another. Then the transmission of those vaccinated versus not. I also personally stay away from anything to do with aborted fetuses.
Then the definition of this vaccine being so different then vaccines I had growing up. Then the shaming or attempt at guilt.
I don't do anything without speaking with my family, my doctor, etc...to bypass all that is a big red flag.
Anyways I have 0.00 fear of covid. I mean none. I am very afraid of getting that jab</p>

<p>The inventor of the mRNA vaccines has called for a stop of massive vaccinations. Let me repeat, the inventor is warning about the dangers! Search for Robert Malone on Twitter.</p>

<p>I know more people who have passed from the vaccine than covid. My friends father died 2 Horus later after the Astra one. It was a horrific death, it was like he was burning inside.</p>

        <p>The mRNA vaccines have no long term safety data. The closest thing we have is Modernas safety data from their experimental gene therapy. Spoiler alert, all their stuff failed animal testing. Because the animals all died.</p>

        <p>In addition to the points of censorship and lack of long-term data, my #1 objection to the vaccine is the effort to the vaccination status to personal freedom.</p>
<p>I don’t let my kids boss me around, and I won’t let the government do it, either. They can’t offer me freedom, their job is to protect the freedom that is already mine.</p>
