    <strong>Cdc says fully vaxxed must wear masks because they can still spread the virus.</strong>
    <p><p>Pretty sure I‚Äôm not the only one who knew this for months I‚Äôd bring it up to vaxxed people and they‚Äôd say we‚Äôll do u have any data ? And then they‚Äôd act like it was just completely impossible üòÇ. But we all knew that a vaccine that‚Äôs as ineffective as this one would still allow the spread of the virus. The only reason the news is reporting it is because they cannot hide it anymore. There basically playing dumb. They said the cdc called it ‚Äúnew science‚Äù I just don‚Äôt know how little old me who‚Äôs not a scientist could have seen this coming from a mile away months ago. If this doesn‚Äôt make it clear they have been lying this whole time I don‚Äôt know what will.</p>

        <p><strong>If the vaccine doesn't stop COVID, what will?</strong></p>
<p>We are moving into a world where we wear masks <strong>indefinitely.</strong></p>
<p>It is not for your safety. If it was, the fucking Queen of England wouldn't have been maskless and gladhanding all those world leaders at the G7.</p>
<p>It is meant to put you in your place. </p>
<p>They think they are superior to you. They get to have lives; we get to work for them.</p>
<p>Soon, "your mask" will become part of daily wear. "It's just like pants, like underwear. It's just a facial covering. Just a simple piece of cloth."</p>
<p>Look around you. Do you like seeing everyone wear masks? Do you like feeling beaten down and owned? Told you're a potential <strong>plague rat</strong>, so you can't be allowed to show your face in public? </p>
<p>Don't you all know something like 80% of communication is non-verbal, and a lot of that 80% involves your full face?</p>
<p>Don't you feel that human connection is missing when you're surrounded by half faces everywhere?</p>
<p>Everyone is quiet and scurrying. Less interaction, less connection.</p>
<p>Does this feel right to you? Does it make you happy? Do you remember feeling like this in 2019?</p>
<p>Fuck it. If you don't see it, I don't know what else to say.</p>

        <p>So vaccines don't stop or slow transmission. They barely protect you against serious infection, and only mildly protect you against asymptomatic infection. What's the point in getting them? And why are governments still pushing them?</p>

        <p>I got verbally abused and almost spit on the other day for not mask wearing by this covid crazed karen losing her shit in the grocery store yesterday. Security had to escort her out. She said she was going to spit in everyone's face who was not wearing a mask. </p>
<p>We live with crazy totalitarian people who feel they need to be in charge of everyone.</p>

        <p>I am so glad that I have not encountered anyone like that.</p>
<p>I stay as far away as I can from people who are masked. They clearly do not want my non masked self anywhere near them and everyone is happier. If someone comes after me, that‚Äôs a different story.</p>
