        <p>I have seen terrified people screaming that none of this matters in this situation because our decisions impact them and we are selfish horrible people for not going along with this "for the greater good". They blame us for the mess we are in. It's all our fault, if we would just stop being so selfish this would end. They don't care about statistics and facts unless their government and media personalities tell them so. We are stupid, we are not scared of the virus but we are scared of the vaccine. I just saw people saying all of these things last night on a pro lockdown pro vax website. They also said they now refuse to live with or have relationships with non vaxed people. As if they can control who they encounter  and everything around them. It was really horrifying to read and made me feel like there are people who are so far gone with this they will never think rationally again.</p>
<p>My only remote hope is that there will be information released soon that may force them to change some of what they are thinking and open the dam for some of them. Some of those fauci emails are pretty damning. Maybe for some it will make them realize lies have been told and if one or two have been told how many others have we been manipulated with?</p>

        <p>Exactly! There are news stories encouraging people not to encounter with those who choose not to take the experimental shot! Like, what?! If anyone should be afraid of anyone else, it would be the people not getting the shot fearing those who did. Those spike proteins are no joke!</p>

        <p>It’s ironic that they say we are selfish... most people who aren’t taking the shot are usually health conscious, while the ones who are taking are the higher risk. I understand some people are at risk who have autoimmune issues, but it’s very selfish of them to have us risk our health just so unhealthy people can live a little longer?</p>
<p>What is life if you fear of dying or getting sick? You might as well die right now or just stay in your ducking house all day. This my life and my family’s life as well.</p>
