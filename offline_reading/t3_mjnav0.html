    <strong>Masks / Social Distancing were not meant to be "magical, perfect solution to end this pandemic"</strong>
    <p><p>It was meant to <strong>"slow down"</strong> the spread of the Coronavirus because we should not overburden the healthcare system.  We also have to consider the workload of the health workers.  </p>
<p>Of course we all can easily see the masks isn't going to perfectly and/or completely stop the coronavirus <strong>because we still have to breathe</strong>, and while social distancing is constantly emphasized and encouraged, we all can quickly realize the "social distancing" won't <strong>completely stop</strong> the spread of the Coronavirus </p>
<p>We now see the transparent shield between the cashier and customers at large supermarkets.  <strong>Of course that is not going to provide some kind of a magical and complete protection for the cashier</strong></p>
<p>I saw quite a few members of this subreddit asking "Why wear a mask? How can wearing masks end this pandemic?" And that was the possible explanation.  Of course it won't, because we still have to breathe.  We still have to interact with others.  <strong>I agree it won't end the pandemic because masks/social distancing won't provide the complete and perfect protection for the general public from the coronavirus</strong>.  </p>
<p>But masks / social distancing will <strong>SLOW DOWN</strong> the spread of the Coronavirus.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago someone said "I will wear a mask for the rest of my life, because for the first time in my life I did not have to suffer catching a cold, and any of its commonly associated symptoms, such as coughing and stuffy nose, for the entire year of 2020"</p>
<p>When I read that, I also realized, for the first time in my life, I did not catch a cold or experience any of the symptoms for the entire year.</p></p>

<p>I would love to see data on crime with unidentified suspects for the last year. How many perps got away with theft, sexual assault, etc because masks have become the norm? </p>

        <p>I was down with slowing the spread to stop the strain on hospitals until the hospitals in my area CUT STAFF HOURS. Yeah, “in the middle of a pandemic”. Then they had the nerve to say their ICU was at 100% capacity, which I later found out meant that they didn’t have enough staff to man the ICU, not that all the beds were full. Manipulation of the statistics for financial gain, all the while begging the public to “flatten the curve”.</p>

        <p>Enough with the self-righteous pretexts. "slow down" the spread smh... </p>
<p>Where is your self-awareness? mask-wearing is an arbitrary gesture that has little correlation with the "spread" or with your own health (though it might make it worse, you are effectively wearing a cell culture on your face. <a href="https://www.ecotextile.com/2021040127603/dyes-chemicals-news/exclusive-chemical-cocktail-found-in-face-masks.html">Not the mention hazardous chemicals you might be breathing in</a>). It is like the football fan that thinks sitting on the left side of the couch affects his favorite team's performance. It is arbitrary. Look at Texas. You could wear a mask for the rest of your life and guess what? you're still gonna die and so is everybody else. We are only shadows and strangers here on earth. We are meant for something greater...</p>
<p>By the way, do you wear a mask while you sleep? If not, hypocrite.</p>

        <p>Exactly. You are able to discern that mask-wearing is pretty whimsical and up to your own discretion. You are able to put aside animal-like fear of getting sick to sleep and drive without one. Now just extend that battle to eradicate fear over your entire day, and that's pretty much where this sub is at. Freedom leaves it up to the citizen, should I wear a mask or not? Will it help me? Tyranny is forcing every citizen to wear a mask, removing personal choice from the equation.</p>
