    <strong>Emergency ultrasound and my husband can't be with me</strong>
    <p><p>If you've seen some of my posts here before you know that I've been dealing with "unexplained" infertility for the last two years. My only pregnancy ended in a loss in 2019 and we've struggled ever since to get pregnant. Well we got some good and very surprising news at the beginning of this month... we <em>finally</em> got another positive test! </p>
<p>Except, I started spotting and having aches on my left side 3 days ago, the exact same day in the pregnancy as the last loss. The midwife is concerned it's an ectopic now.</p>
<p>The previous loss started with spotting too, and the same hospital doing a scan at 5 weeks and 5 days and not finding the pregnancy, so they kept me in the maternity ward and made me listen to the new moms and babies crying for 3 days before giving me an ultimatum: I could stay there for 10 days to see if the pregnancy showed up (I lived too far from the hospital so they wouldn't discharge me to wait at home), or I could have a laparoscopy to rule out ectopic and a D&amp;C scrape and go home the next day. </p>
<p>It was torture being there listening to all the happiness going on around me while I lost everything so I went with the surgery. Afterwards, they gave me a pat on the head telling me I'd be pregnant again soon. WRONG!</p>
<p>Now I have to go for another early ultrasound tomorrow and while I was being scheduled got the news that even in my tiny local hospital, my husband is not allowed in the room during the emergency scan. If we get bad news, I will have to go through all of this again, this time by myself while he sits out in the parking lot oblivious as to what is going on. Needless to say, I AM FREAKING THE FUCK OUT. </p>
<p>WHY are they allowing this? Wouldn't they ask him the same screening questions they ask me at the door? If I am about to get some of the worst news of my life or (hopefully) the best news of my life, why can't he be by my side? IT'S HIS BABY TOO.</p>
<p>I can't stop crying about this. I was feeling okay this morning until that bitch of a nurse told me no partners allowed, even with me having severe anxiety and PTSD from my last loss. </p>
<p>We have had barely any covid cases in our region. Everyone who wanted to be vaccinated is protected now, right?? So why does it matter??</p>
<p><strong>THIS IS CRUEL AND INHUMANE.</strong> I want my husband with me for this. I don't want to be in a tiny room with a stranger wearing a mask when I find out if my baby is viable or not. Even my friend in the next province over got to have her mom with her for her scans just last month. I honestly don't understand the difference in policy on this or why it's even a thing.</p>
<p>Sorry for ranting here but I don't have anyone else I can talk to about this since it's still so early, we haven't told anyone :( I'm just so scared and I don't know what to do. I almost don't even want to go to be honest. I figure if I die at home from an ectopic because this one isn't viable too, oh well. At least I'll die happy thinking I was pregnant. I don't even care any more. </p>
<p>FUCK COVID and FUCK THE ASSHOLES IN CHARGE OF THIS DYSTOPIC NIGHTMARE. I hope they all rot in hell.</p></p>

        <p>I've suffered 3 miscarriages, one was almost to term. The platitudes are well meaning but I understand not wanting to hear them. I'm sorry you have to endure that traumatic experience alone. You have every right to be upset.</p>

        <p>I just wanted to say I'm so sorry that you're going through this. 4 miscarriages, the last one almost killed me, literally. People don't get it, but some do. Hugs, I hope the best for you.</p>

        <p>No one around me understands, no one close to me has ever had a loss or dealt with infertility. It's awful. I hate that this journey is nothing like we are told after you suffer a loss. It's not exciting or joyous. It's scary and frightening, even without covid. I'm sorry for your losses. I hate that you had to go through that. It's just not fair :( Thank you for listening and understanding xox</p>

        <p>I don't know the laws, but can you see a midwife and have a homebirth there? I had similar issues as you, and my midwife gave me the number of an ultrasound tech she worked with who came out to my house and did a home ultrasound. It would be great if you could do something like that. I'm so sorry you're going through this. I will pray that you get good news this time. ❤️</p>

        <p>Thank you ❤️ I do have a midwife lined up and we plan to have the baby at a birthing center if we actually make it that far this time. We haven't even had an appointment with the midwife yet since it's still so early. And unfortunately they don't have the equipment to do ultrasounds anywhere else but the hospital two hours from my home since we are so rural. My local clinic only has a Doppler machine and it won't pick up a pregnancy at 6 weeks :(</p>
