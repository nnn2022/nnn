    <strong>Local Covid Stuff that Doesn't Make Sense? What have you guys seen?</strong>
    <p><p>We all know the stupid logic holes that the big governments have taken over the last year and a half, but what are people seeing locally?</p>
<p>Last year, I remember all the local throw and go/fast food restaurants closing the lobby, drive thru only, even went so far as card only... and the person taking your card would wear gloves and mask... but they'd take your card (and those that took cash, your cash) and would swipe it, make change, and give it back... then the next person in line, same thing.  That was before it was shown to not be easily picked up from surface contact... soooo, what the hell was the point of that?</p>
<p>THIS WEEK - one person went into the county clerk's office, and then later tested positive.  This person was a customer, not an employee.  That office is in the courthouse.  That office closed for the week - despite everyone that works there having had it already or being vaxxed.  BUT THEY ARE STILL WORKING.  The doors are just locked to the public. They're coming in through the same doors everyone else is, passing people in the halls, using the same bathrooms, and letting people in that call ahead (Attorneys who need to do land records checks, their staff, etc).  But the average joe doesn't know this, so they're fuck out of luck if they need to record a deed or something until next week.... this office is paid for by tax payer money btw.</p>
<p>What. the. fuck?  HOW does this make one bit of sense?</p>
<p>What other stupid shit have you guys seen or are you guys seeing now on a local level?</p></p>

        <p>A condo I used to live in decided that allowing residents to pick up deliveries anywhere outside was contributing to the spread of COVID. </p>
<p>To combat this they decided that all deliveries had to be collected in a tiny room, where several people would congregate at a time.</p>
<p>They also closed off the garden for two weeks because somebody who tested positive walked her dog there daily.</p>

        <p>I’ve seen the Covid closures and modified customer service procedures used as an excuse to not work as hard and not provide good customer service. I’ve seen this at hotels, restaurants, grocery stores, amusement parks- you know where all the <em>heros</em> work. People in lower paying jobs were making as much or more doing absolutely fucking nothing and now they would love nothing more than to go back to doing absolutely fucking nothing.</p>

        <p>Back to my courthouse comments - The entire last year it was a bastard to try to get a trial, a hearing, or any type of legal remedy at all.  I had cases on the back burner off and on for the entirety of the last year.  No one wanted to work.</p>
<p>The courthouses that are the worst offenders have a reputation within the legal field of looking for any excuse to close anyway.  Fuck all has been gotten done and when you shut down the legal system like that, for that long, it's like trying to get a really huge freight train moving again.</p>
<p>Now we're back to Any Excuse.</p>
<p>I don't know how much longer the taxpaying public is going to tolerate this.</p>

        <p>There is no doubt in my mind.</p>
<p>If this was truly the 'highly contagious airborne killer virus' as claimed, we're all infected by now.</p>
<p>People simply do not have the attention to detail required, nor the Bio-Lab Level decontamination procedure training that would be required to truly protect themselves from such a dangerous threat.</p>
<p>FFS, they're wearing a 30 cent surgical mask that does not seal around their face.</p>
<p>You either decide to breathe, or you get filtration. The more filtration, the harder it is to breathe, you can't have both.</p>
<p>This is why true anti-viral respiratory masks with proper seals and filtration frequently must go to mechanical means to supply you with air, because it would be too hard to breathe through and get the oxygen you need.</p>

        <p>This was at the beginning of the total lockdown last year:</p>
<p>- Spraying disinfectant around on the streets.</p>
<p>- Having an entrance floor mat with disinfectant at every mall / store entrance.</p>
<p>- People allowed to buy foods in the wet market only on specific days according to the first letter in their name, without having to prove their name in anyway.</p>
<p>Now it's not as bad, but still annoying:</p>
<p>- Still we need to wear face shield everywhere in addition to face mask.</p>
<p>- Curfew from 12mn till 5am every night.</p>
<p>- Cannot enter home without scanning your contact tracing QR code.</p>

        <p>The chain places by us still have what I assume are permanently modified hours.  It's I believe 100% due to not being able to find anyone to work.  </p>
<p>See Covid was about so much more for the leftists.  They got their whole wish list including raising the minimum wage.  And like everything else, they did it without a single vote or public input.</p>
<p>Biden has told employers to basically just go ahead and compete with the federal government for wages, with their unlimited number of printing presses running 24/7 running in the background.</p>
<p>He will pay people 40k to sit home and as an employer how do you compete with that.  What is the number above 40k that would make someone get off their ass?  In other words if you didn't have any huge responsibilities or any pride and you could make 40k to sit home and do whatever you want all day would you be part of the grind for 50k?  That's only 10k more than what you get to relax all day.  Would you do it for 60k?  Probably not.</p>

        <p>To be fair, you can't spend 18 months scaring the living crap out of people then expect them to merrily put themselves into harms way for lousy pay.</p>
<p>Also with added threat of being forced to wear a Mask all day and mandatory Vax, makes them even less eager to work</p>
<p>On the other side, I agree with you, but for me I see the benefits a detriment (Canada) past a real emergency as it HAS allowed this pandemic and fear to go on a lot longer than it normally would - and mainly without question - because people are still comfortable and bellies fed.. so who's going to question the narrative?  </p>
<p>That would mean the $$ would end, and they would have to work again..</p>

        <p>I was required to use hand sanitizer before trying on clothes, which of course was after I stood in line to do so because every other dressing room was closed. Then, any clothes I didn't want were put on a special rack so the clothes could quarantine. <em>So the clothes could quarantine.</em></p>
<p>The local outdoor farmer's market had the following rules: You couldn't buy food to eat there; you were supposed to get it to go. The merchant at the candle stand would hold the candle while you smelled it. The merchants would hand you a metal tin for you to put your credit card in, they would swipe the card, drop it back in the tin, and then you would take the credit card out.</p>
