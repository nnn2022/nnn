    <strong>I Feel Bad For The Children Growing Up In This Plandemic Era. They Are Absolutely Fuc*ed. My Experience Today.</strong>
    <p><p>For context, I live in Ontario. Majority of you on this sub know that Ontario has had 1 of the craziest restrictions in the world. Gyms are still closed, dine in is still not open, masks are still mandatory and you get the idea. But since like last week, they're allowing gatherings at Mosques/Churches to open at only 15% of its capacity. </p>
<p>So, annually in My old ends, I volunteer for the summer school kids program. Just for serving and being part in the community etc and today was the first day. Seeing these kids, I was shocked. After spending 1 1/2 year locked up in their homes with no activity, these children for a lack of better word were looking retar-ted. But it's not even their faults. It was like, they forgot how to socialize and how to talk to people and make friends etc. And, did I forget? In the hot weather, these poor kids were required to wear those fucking face diapers. Majority of them we're sitting alone in their corner just on their tablets/phones. When I told them to go make friends and play, they're like "Parents told me not to talk to anyone because of covid." That's when I lost it.</p>
<p>Why the fuck are you sending your kids to summer camp, when you're not even letting them socialize? And the other worse part? When 1 Karen type was picking her son up she was like to her son, "Didn't I tell you to wear 2 masks? Where's your other one?" Because the poor kid was wearing 1 because it was so fucking hot. These parents are the biggest enemies of their children. They're raising anti-social slaves to the government without knowing it's long term consequences. And these kids we're like 11 to 13. Not even that young.</p>
<p>I remember when I was that age, I was making a business off in school by selling pens and gum overpriced to the wealthier kids. So, I could buy a good lunch and it was very profitable loool for a 10 year old. I used to convince them just like that, in that age and I was so extroverted, and yet, not even 1 generation later,  the same age kids of today are anti-social freaks who are enslaved to their technological devices and don't have any proper human interaction. And these draconian lockdowns only made it worse.</p>
<p>I couldn't bear seeing all that today. Most likely I'll just quit. I feel too bad for them and unfortunately I can't help them. If I do and say something, those brainwashed Karen's will come after Me. In conclusion, the kids and the generation that's growing in this plandemic era are absolutely fucked. And the parents who believe in this clown meme virus are the biggest enemies of their poor little children.</p></p>

        <p>"Mommy says I'll die without my mask. She says you not wearing a mask will kill me." Roughly something I heard a few months ago and that's the US. I hope you're well. Hopefully your family doesn't worship Trudeau.</p>

        <p>It's funny, the Liberals who wanted to get rid of our First Past the Post voting system all mysteriously shut the fuck up when Trudeau only managed to secure a minority government, while the Conservative Party tallied the most votes.</p>

        <p>Or, they’ll grow up pissed off and take their freedom by force. I’d prefer to look at the optimistic angle. By assuming we’re doomed, we’re inadvertently fighting for the other side. Humans are too social and too violent to sit back forever.</p>

        <p>I had optimism that this sjw nonsense was just a fad and would go away, when it first started about 20 years ago. Well here we are and it's only gotten worse. I still had some optimism until this covid plandemic started and I saw how quickly the majority of the world bowed their knee and went with the herd. I have no optimism anymore.</p>

        <p>It first started well before World War 2.  The US media running desperate defense for Alger Hiss, as well as Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, coupled with their political hit on Joseph McCarthy were great shows of the SJW movement in action.</p>

        <p>That's why I let my students talk to their friends/ have social activities in class. Im glad our kids werent too affected, but the media addiction is VERY strong. If I had kids, I would simply not give them any device. 
Its rewiring their brains and attention span.</p>

        <p>Yep, media devices are destroying kids' brains (and eyes) and really putting them at a long-term disadvantage. No kid should have a smartphone with Internet access. It's hard enough for adults to control their own usage - how do we expect kids to do that? It's like giving them a backpack full of candy to carry around and then being surprised that they eat it instead of healthy food.</p>

        <p>My daughter has a Note 8 (a hand-me down from me and mom upgrading our phones).</p>
<p>Youtube is disabled, and it's filled with math games, match puzzle games, reading games, coloring games and such.  I do download videos from youtube to my PC and sideload them after they go through my approval process.</p>
<p>We also have other games like phonics flash cards and such.</p>
<p>She's 3 and can name something like 20 kinds of dinosaur, she's starting to read three letter words through sounding them out (fuck the sight-reading technique that creates functional illiterate 8th graders), and is starting to write both upper and lower case letters, and do basic addition and subtraction.</p>
<p>Having a device in and of itself is not a bad thing, and let's face it, these devices are here to stay.  But just handing an internet connected device to a kid and telling them "have at it" is definitely a disservice to them, bordering on neglect.</p>

        <p>Exactly. I remember doing educational games on the computer as a kid in the 90s - no Internet. It wasn't a problem in moderation because there were limits. Even if I spent too long on the conputer, I was limited in terms of what I could do.</p>
<p>But the Internet is limitless. And a lot of games now have an Internet component (e.g. Minecraft) that brings that limitless quality into the game-playing experience as well.</p>
<p>Also sight reading is stupid and I'm pretty sure the whole point is TO create illiterate 8th graders. Why learn how to recognize linguistic patterns when you can just memorize every single word, amirite? And then have no idea what to do with an unfamiliar word? What a great method!</p>

        <p>My dad is a Family and Marriage Counselor. He spent many years in school getting two Masters degrees and so he obviously studied a lot of psychology and human development.</p>
<p>His big concern is kids in the younger years (3-9), or kids who just started to go to school. They have to wear masks during this critical time in their development. How are they going to learn to pick up on facial expressions? They won’t be able to understand people’s expressions if they don’t learn it early on but masks are blocking the way. It’s easier for us who are older now because we developed unconsciously, but that won’t be the case for these younger generations.</p>
<p>We’re basically creating more children with autism-like symptoms of not understanding certain social cues.</p>

        <p>On a separate note. I watched these two kids playing by a pool once, and they started talking to each other. One of the kids had a bag of chips and offered it to the other kid. The kid who was offered said, “We probably shouldn’t share those because of COVID, right?” and the kid agreed and put the chips away.</p>
<p>How fucked up is that? We’ve convinced some kids that sharing is bad. Breaks my heart.</p>

        <p>That's terrible. Well I would understand if you'd quit, but you and the kids that are socializing and playing without fear may give these poor kids a spark of hope and open up to the idea that things may not be so bad as they are told (I mean regarding the disease).</p>

        <p>Fellow Commonwealther here, South Australia. Honestly, aside from maybe 2/3 months, our main city of a million hasn't been locked down/restricted that bad. But let me tell you, our kids are just as fucking zonked man. Sure, we don't have the mask problems, but you can see the antisocial thing creeping in. Some kids literally refuse to function without a device. Seeing it more and more, parents taking their kids out for the day, but the kids are NOT interested. It's disgusting. I just can't see how as a parent you think it's OK for your 3/4/5/6 year old to be on a phone while walking around and out.</p>
<p>If your kids gets upset if they aren't on the phone, that's on you for fuck sake not the world </p>
<p>But yeah, I'm starting to think the only way the world will change is if we stop trying to help. Just live in your world and do it right. As you said, if you got those kids to do anything you'd be torn to shreds. It's just the state of play</p>

        <p>They made it a 'bad word', but it really IS what stopping development, education &amp; socialization for a year &amp; a half IS! It is deliberate too. To make it so much worse is parents that are just plunking kids with a tablet &amp; refusing to interact with their kids. "Go play with your tablet"... </p>
<p>I only have a couple friends with little kids, but "the R word" is exactly what zero structure, kids their age to play with &amp; constant 'electronic parenting' has done to them.</p>

        <p>My three year old daughter plays at our local playground, and doesn't wear a mask, most of the other kids don't wear masks either.  Actually, recently I haven't seen ANY kids with masks on.  Me and the other parents would openly ridicule parents who forced masks on their kids.</p>
<p>Yesterday I FINALLY convinced my wife to walk into a store with no mask on (I've been doing this since January, when I simply decided enough is enough).  Of course, my daughter was there too, just walked in and told the door person that we are all exempt.  Stores don't give a shit, and claiming exemption relieves them of liability.  </p>
<p>Just for the record, my daughter is fine with wearing a mask and never really fussed over them, but I refuse to let her be under the impression that it is normal.</p>
