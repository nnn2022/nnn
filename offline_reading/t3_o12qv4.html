        <p>All shots are detrimental as symptoms are actually how the body regulates homeostasis via the lymphatic system - this can not be passed on to another organsism--this includes cold and flu.</p>
<p>You can not inject health.</p>
<p>It is our internal environment which creates all dis-ease--we call these symptoms; in actuality, the only thing our body can do is remove morbid matter. Cough, sneeze, sweat, urination, feces, skin eruptions--the body can do no more than this.</p>
<p>All cells must detox as we recycle millions of cells daily, or else the organism would die. There is no catching an illness other than one's own habits.</p>
<p>The immune system does not stop any invader--this idea is to make us think there is always a war going on. When in fact, our immune system's job is to remove trash from our body; when this can not happen--cancer and other conditions arise.</p>
<p>To have the idea of contagion, you must first ask where the first of each infectious organism came from.</p>
<p>You then realize you do not catch sickness--it is from what you eat (nutritional deficiency, toxicity), toxins (emf, injections, modern medicine), drink, think, and feel.</p>
<p>Germs are our clean up crew--they feed on our morbid matter in attempts to heal us.</p>

        <p>Um yes and no. Yes since some kids are getting severely sick, but no since some arent.</p>
<p>Its more of a 50-50, and I really a cant take any sides. The saying "you cant make everyone happy" applies here since the vaccine probably cant be made to fit everyone. And realistcly, they just want the pandmec to end. You can't expect to have everyone not have a reaction to the vaccine. Regardless, I want the vaccine, since I personally dont care. Some people get sick, and some dont. Also, your always gambling them if you think about it. If they go to school they run the risk of a school shooting. You risk them at every time, yet the risk is greater than others at times. Deal with it.</p>
