        <p>I don't know what this has to do with lockdowns. But I just turned on the news for a the first time in months and noticed they made sure to include lots of black people. I don't care whatsoever. I realize that most people are mixed race and could have been raised in any culture regardless of what they look like. I grew up watching reading rainbow and fresh prince, so I never knew racism until I discovered that my father is a closet racist when I was a teenager. I always call him out when he lets slip an illogical racist remark, but he believes he's not racist because he likes white-washed black people. Anyways, I personally feel that sexism is a bigger issue, but that's probably because I'm a woman. Although "toxic masculinity" harms men too. Similarly, I think that white people, both liberal and conservative, feel left out because they don't have a strong culture. Or conservatives feel that their culture is being attacked and far lefts latch onto politics as their culture. Edit: I'm fine with any sex preferences too as long as it's consensual. Your body your choice.</p>
