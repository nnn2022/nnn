    <strong>double doomer aunt's Rant.</strong>
    <p><p>Just a random pointless vent post, don't really have anyone to talk too, but anyways I went for a walk with my doomer aunt, she wore no mask! and she freaks out every time people pass by, keep in my mind this is with wide trails in the woods.  She tells me shes too scared to go to a bank with a mask on as well, it was a painful walk, i pretty much stayed silent when she talks about covidiots  anti maskers etc..  was tough, she soaks up the MSM all day while i soak up information on the "other side" total opposites, i have another doomer aunt too who's a pro masker, and where i live twice as many people have died from the flu than covid so far and of course im walking back home after and i see a big group of masked 4 yr olds walking, so depressing, i just want a break in the nice nature and i have to see this shit.. anyways bout it.</p>
<p>she think's im a good nephew and all that, but she just lucked out that i'm a big loner anyways.</p></p>

        <p>sometimes ignorance and compliance for weaker folk is the answer, just cherish her while she is still cognitive.</p>
