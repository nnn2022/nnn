    <strong>People in regions that are still locked down, what do people say when you tell them that some US states have been open for over a year with no problems?</strong>
    <p><p>I recently moved from Illinois which was locked down for a long time, and when talking to people that thought the lockdowns were helpful I would bring up that Florida had been open for months with no problems and they didn't know how to respond. Some would say "but they have a high number of cases, right?" I would say that their cases are lower than ours and their death rates are lower too. Then they would just get this puzzled look on their face, but I don't think they changed their view on lockdowns. It was if I were speaking a different language and their minds couldn't comprehend. The indoctrination has been set for many people.</p></p>

        <p>Even though New York State is mostly out of lockdowns now, I still have had conversations with people about how Florida, Texas and Sweden had very limited covid measures in place but still fared FAR better overall than here, and every single person has responded by telling me those places are just falsifying their covid numbers.</p>
<p>No discussion, no questions, they just simply say "not true, fake news" and that's it.</p>

        <p>When I've responded and said it was actually Cuomo who was caught fudging the numbers, they just shrug and admit that it's true but that those other places are doing it too.</p>
<p>I mean, Cuomo certainly isn't popular among the right in NYS, but the left really doesn't like him much, either. They just figure he's not a Republican and that's good enough.</p>

        <p>Before I was banned from r/ontario I would bring up Texas and Florida and the response would be Texas = x deaths, Ontario = y deaths, lockdowns work and we don't want to be like Texas. They would completely ignore:</p>
<ul>
<li>The health/diet of the population</li>
<li>The age of the population</li>
<li>The populations access to quality health care</li>
<li>What was being marked as a COVID death (from what I can tell, Ontario was fairly consistent with reversing died with COVID cases)</li>
<li>Probably a dozen other things I can't think of</li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>While we still have restrictions, I am 90% convinced they will try and shut things down again in the late fall and there will be a lot of blue-pilled double vaxxed double masked users on r/ontario that wake up to this insanity.</p>

        <p>Seattle is all about lockdowns and the vaccine. Masks everywhere. People actually still terrified and look at me like I’m literally stupid about the numbers going down in certain states with not as many precautions. It’s all about coercing everyone to get the vaccine. Something I hear often “I don’t understand why anyone wouldn’t want the vaccine.” People who are for my body my choice are now dumbfounded that people want to exercise their personal autonomy on making such a personal decision in putting a foreign substance in their body. A lot of people here are for forcing vaccines. More and more jobs are requiring it. My friend told me if I don’t get the vaccine, it will take longer for the lockdowns to end. That’s stupid, I’m not telling you to stay home and taking your rights away, that’s the government. My own dad just tells me “just get the vaccine” with no personal research to back it up and is for some reason treating me like I am more diseased before the vaccine came out. And then tells me if I don’t take the vaccine people will take my rights away and how that’s okay because of the news he sees without any information to back it up. And Is telling me I will kill grandma even though grandma is literally begging me to come see her. Everything is bonkers.</p>

        <p>Just tell them you got it, take a selfie with a band aid on your arm and two masks on. Or a big fb post about how you feel safe to take off your mask for the first time in 18 months because you got the vaccine.</p>
<p>I moved my family to a red state where people don't care, but if all my family were indoctrinated and I didn't want to leave I would be tempted to fib on it.</p>

        <p>In 2021 you cannot expect anybody to exert any mental force at a problem whatsoever. You are supposed to give them a suppository of knowledge that oozes out of your mouth with divinity of ambrosic vomite. Let alone ask them to perform independent thinking AFTER they have read an article. Mind you, most of them can't read critically enough.</p>

        <p>People don't believe it. They spend most of their time watching mainstream news, and have wildly inaccurate ideas of what their own community is like, let alone communities outside of their immediate view. They view other places as racist, sexist, dangerous, unintelligent, stuck in a backwards religion, and most of all unhealthy. It's a bizarre form of projection.</p>
