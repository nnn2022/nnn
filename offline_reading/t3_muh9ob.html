    <strong>Was there any other way to do this?</strong>
    <p><p>So, I like to think that most people here are critical thinkers. Every day I look at both “sides” of this Covid story and what’s came of it. I can safely say i’m stubborn in my beliefs and am anti mask/ lockdown/ vaccine still and always will be. </p>
<p>I feel this is what separates a lot of people, and that the people who believe the narrative don’t even question if “our” (I hate saying this because I feel it’s feeding into another aspect of what they’re trying to do- divide) side is correct. </p>
<p>Anyways, my question is: if this is virus is perpetuated to be as bad as they say to usher in passports, is the the only way to do it? Wouldn’t there have been a much easier way? Or was it all just about money this whole time? Is it just a tactic to push people further away from family and religion? I’m really having a hard time lately understanding why</p></p>

        <p>You won't like the answer.   You may not believe it.</p>
<p>It's about the Great Reset and Agenda 2030.</p>
<p>Start here:  https://www.corbettreport.com/explaining-the-great-reset-to-conspiracy-beginners/</p>
<p>This is good too:  https://www.corbettreport.com/who-is-bill-gates-full-documentary-2020/</p>
<p>Basically, the 'Virus' is hyped to scare you.   Masks are there to remind you to be scared.   Lockdowns are there to herd you into a new lifestyle and ruin small businesses, concentrating wealth and control in very large centralized corporations.</p>
<p>Vaccines create a verification problem that naturally leads people to demand an identification and verification system.   </p>
<p>Once these things are in place, the next steps are about the financial system and moving everyone over to a new currency with UBI as yet another means of control and rationing energy and food.</p>
<p>After that... well, it gets worse.</p>

        <p>I think people need to have an enemy and be in fear to be more easily manipulated. This situation gave people an identifiable “enemy” they could turn their attention to and because they’re scared they just do it. </p>
<p>I agree that separation is their biggest goal and again this turned out to be a great tool to divide us. I’m sure there was another way but this seemed to work better than I would’ve expected.</p>

        <p>I don't believe any of it is fake or contrived, so I won't have a popular answer. But I will say, there were some countries that handled it a hell of a lot better than we did. South Korea, New Zealand, Australia as examples. They had intense lockdowns early on, but were able to fully open much sooner because they did a much better job of contact tracing and containment etc.</p>
<p>My other question for you would be to ask if this is all just a big contrived power grab, why are places like China and Russia apparently aligned exactly the same as places like South Korea or the US? Just seems really weird to me to think that all the governments of the world - including the ones who openly hate each other - would be on the exact same page with perpetrating this huge hoax on everyone.</p>

        <p>I’m sure they could’ve done it easier without as much pushback from minorities. I mean it is genius how it’s happening, but There must’ve been an easier way</p>
