    <strong>What's "irresponsible" is lying to vulnerable people that cloth masks work rather than N-95 etc</strong>
    <p><p>The entire "irresponsible" excuse is so frustrating to me. </p>
<p>I facetimed with my grandma out today getting her nails done like she should of course be able to but she has a cloth mask on. It really got me thinking that with all of the "irresponsible" information censoring... them witholding the information that they know damn well N-95 and above are the only masks that work that they Is the utmost "irresponsible"</p></p>

        <p>This is my take:</p>
<p>- Hand out free N95s to the vulnerable and the fearful. Frankly, at this point, I would rather taxpayer-subsidize this than pay people to sit on their asses at home collecting CERB.</p>
<p>- Now that you have protected the vulnerable with a mask that actually provides a level of protection, ditch the mandatory mask mandates, curfews, business restrictions, and lockdowns - <em>and let the rest of us get on with our fucking lives!</em></p>

        <p>100% agree with you, vulnerable people that have to go out should be handed FFP2 (N95) / 3 masks. Those masks ARE effective against covid if handled and used with a strict protocol. They are immensely annoying to wear btw.</p>
<p>Cheap Chinese paper masks and worst of all: ANY fabric masks are not effective and a loss of time and money for everyone. Beyond that they also give a false sense of protection letting people forget about the most basic (non pandemic) sanitary rules.</p>

        <p>On <strong>20 November</strong> 2020, <em>Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</em> published <em>Physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses</em>, <a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006207.pub5/epdf/abstract">(Jefferson et al., 2020)</a>. The review noted: </p>
<p>&rt;Medical or surgical masks: Seven studies took place in the community, and two studies in healthcare workers. Compared with wearing no mask, wearing a mask may make <strong>little to no difference</strong> in how many people caught a flu-like illness (9 studies; 3507 people); and probably makes <strong>no difference</strong> in how many people have flu confirmed by a laboratory test (6 studies; 3005 people). Unwanted effects were rarely reported, but included discomfort. </p>
<p>&rt;N95/P2 respirators: Four studies were in healthcare workers, and one small study was in the community. Compared with wearing medical or surgical masks, wearing N95/P2 respirators probably makes <strong>little to no difference</strong> in how many people have confirmed flu (5 studies; 8407 people); and may make <strong>little to no difference</strong> in how many people catch a flu-like illness (5 studies; 8407 people) or respiratory illness (3 studies; 7799 people). Unwanted effects were not well reported; discomfort was mentioned.</p>

        <p>Eh, I’m pretty sure N95s offer some protection. N99 and 100’s definitely do.</p>
<p>If you mean “pointless” as in we shouldn’t be required to wear them, most people wouldn’t wear them right, etc I agree. But actual niosh high rated masks certainly would offer some protection to the wearer.</p>

        <p>N95s have exhaust valves, because they're too dense to be able to survive breathing in and out through one. Which of course destroys the fiction that masks protect other people, so we need to have shitty placebo masks to keep the sheep from thinking too hard.</p>

        <p>Not all n95 have exhaust valves. They are difficult to breathe in after a while though. Theoretically if you keep changing them out (as medical people do/used to do) they aren’t too bad. It’s usually a build up of condensation/sweat that takes them from mildly annoying to breathe in to feeling like you’re suffocating. When they’re fresh they’re doable.</p>
<p>I have to occasionally wear them for work, not medical but for industrial (fine dust) applications.</p>
