    <strong>Be Careful of Attempts to divide us...</strong>
    <p><p>... and be prepared to fight narratives that do, or create artificial divisions towards the cause where none should exist.</p>
<p>We are all well aware of the strategy of divide and conquer.  It's a commonly used strategy and is by and large, one of the most effective and most used strategy by those in power to reduce the ability of the populace to stand against them.</p>
<p>What the elite fear most is a united populace with singular goals against them that refuses to be divided by arbitrary divisions that have nothing to do with and are completely irrelevant to the overall goal of standing against them and their goals.</p>
<p>We're all here from various different backgrounds with various different beliefs.</p>
<p>We are not the right, we are not as a whole concerned with promoting right wing ideology.  We oppose mandatory vaccines and the attempts by those in power to impose draconian laws and eliminate our basic rights.  If there are anti-lockdown vaccine passport democrats to vote for and their only right wing option is pro-vaccine mandates and lockdowns, by and large they will vote democrat.</p>
<p>We do not oppose the left, we are not as a whole against left wing ideals.  Many on the left are among our number.  Many will likely vote right wing if the only left wing candidate is pro-mandate but the republican is not, by and large they will vote Republican.</p>
<p>We gain nothing by pushing the left vs right divide the elite are trying to convince of with bullshit like calling us Trump supporters and Q Conspiracists.  Let's not fall into the same trap.  It's about vaccine mandates, etc.  Let's push back against narratives that attempt to paint us as right wing, and let's make sure those on the left know we're inclusive and not let them paint us as opposed to the left.</p>
<p>It does not matter if you're neither of the above or opposed to both parties.  While I agree the two party system needs to be abolished, it does not change that a message can still be sent voting along these lines if the candidate claims to support our cause.  At worst the elite are pressured to back off, at best, they are put into a position where things become so undisputably corrupt and unsaveable we can actually do something about it.</p>
<p>We aren't religious as a whole.  There are many reasons people oppose the vaccines, many along non religious grounds.  Being for vaccine mandates has nothing to do with it.  While there are religious reasons to be opposed to the vaccine mandates, there are many religious reasons to be for them, especially as many religious leaders toe the line.  Being religious does not make one immune to the propaganda, nor does it make one immune to corruption or fear.  Do not attempt to paint the opposition into atheists or turn this into a pointless Atheism vs. Religioun issue.  It's not the point.</p>
<p>We aren't atheists as a whole.  There are many people who fight along side us, whose reasons are religious in nature.  Accept that their reasons are different from yours, but they are allies just the same.  It does not matter whether you consider it logical or rational, this is about body autonomy and our rights.  Both you and they agree, even if for different reasons, that we need to fight for the rights of each other.</p>
<p>We aren't one race, we aren't one nationality, we aren't one sexual orientation, we aren't one gender.</p>
<p>We oppose vaccine mandates, vaccine passports, and all the other draconian changes the elite are trying to place on society using this pandemic.</p>
<p>I've seen lots of messaging and narratives lately that while they seem innocent at face value, when broken down and observed for what they are, are highly divisive in nature, and whether innocently in intent or not, still serve such a function.</p>
<p>Be aware, there will be infiltrators doing their best to pull on your religious or non religious beliefs, on your political beliefs or desire to avoid politics, to use your race, gender or orientation to convince you to either leave the cause, or push others away from the cause.  Don't fall into this trap.  Don't let them convince you that you aren't welcome here, and don't let them convince you anyone anyone else who would stand with us is not.</p>
<p>United we stand, divided we fall.</p>
<p>All are welcome.</p>
<p>Do not support such divisive rhetoric and downvote it when you see it.  Don't let them paint us as intolerant.</p></p>

        <p>How about discussing that.</p>
<p>I can't include every possible division in my statement.  What important ones have I left out making it too narrow, feel free to add some.</p>
<p>Also which ones specifically do you disagree with?</p>
<p>As for disagreeing, there's going to plenty all of us disagree with.  But if we let every little disagreement divide us, we lose.</p>
<p>As for what we are being too narrow, victory requires focus.  I tried my best to keep what we are simple enough to succeed while inclusive enough to allow for the number of different viewpoints necessary for success.</p>

        <p>Does it really matter though if someone is left wing if they work with you to stop mandatory vaccines, etc?</p>
<p>This is about a very specific and important issue.  Are you really so petty you can't work with someone of a different ideology to fight for a shared outcome on a specific cause?</p>
<p>This is about fighting mandatory vaccines, etc, it's not about establishing a right wing or left wing government.</p>
<p>Focus.</p>
<p>I mean, really, let's imagine, you're out protesting mandatory vaccines.  You find out the person protesting next to you is left wing.  You telling me you're going to tell him to fuck off and that he's not welcome and this protest isn't for him?  Because that's basically what you're saying.</p>

        <p>How dare you tell me to focus? I'm doing everything possible to resist and to inform family and friends. And how dare you call me petty because I won't sign your blank check statement of who "we" are? Get off your soap box. It is imperious ideology like yours that divides us, not minor dissent like mine.</p>

        <p>And if your family or friend is left wing, but agrees with you about the vaccine, and JUST the vaccine, are you going to tell them that's not good enough and to fuck off rather than letting them stand along side you and fight?</p>

        <p>Not really.  I'm actually finding this annoying because I think fundamentally you agree and are just being contrarian or not seeing the overall point and are quibling for no good reason as I very much doubt, if you're honest about fighting this, you'd turn down millions of fellow protesters against mandatory vaccines, or a family member just because their views differ from yours on other matters.  Which means fundamentally you either agree, or are trying to twist the movement to push your political ideals.</p>
<p>Possibly with the intent of trying to paint me as intolerant to harm the message.  Which I'd hope is not the the case.</p>
