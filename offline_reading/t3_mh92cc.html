        <p>&rt;You will see how they suppress every effective cure for Covid-19, so they can enforce a very dangerous vaccine onto all of humanity. This vaccine will contain nanotechnology that connects us to artificial intelligence and start the process of transhumanism, making us hybrids that lose the ability to think freely. If you think that's insane, you're right. It is pure madness, but it's nevertheless the hidden agenda behind the vaccine for Covid-19. </p>
<p>Yeah, I'm sure I will trust these people. They sound like they know what they are talking about.</p>
<p>They list zero sources that say the vaccines contain nanotechnology. So basically they are spreading misinformation.</p>

        <p>You prefer to believe the governments and scientists that banned cures/treatments for covid? ðŸ˜‚ I don't really believe in the nanotechnology. But, we're electrical beings, and we have electromagnetism in every cell and part of us so, it's not impossible.</p>
<p>Believing in only one side of the narrative, is dangerous. Though I don't properly believe the nanotechnology, everything else is accurate and was on the news all this time.</p>

        <p>If they make false claims then you can't really trust anything they say, they are just trying to grab your attention. That's why fake news is so bad, they get you hooked and you don't know what to believe so you end up believing in everything.</p>
<p>I don't think you understand the implication of nanotechnology on "electrical beings" (as you put it) and how it isn't feasible. If you read any biology textbook you would understand it much more clearly and how it is basically nonsensical. </p>
<p>I understand not trusting the government, but if you don't trust a biology textbook, then you are abnormally paranoid.</p>

        <p>I agree with you in the first sentence, and I don't lose my sleep over this. But why were so many doctors silenced and impeded of speaking? Where are the independent researchs? Where are the ones that doubt all this? Silenced, ignored, banned, being called conspiracy theorists. It's very convenient for the big corps that this happen, and don't be deluded that these governments and corps are not corrupt, or else you'll be very disappointed.</p>
<p>I never said I don't trust a biology book, actually I love science, I've always been a good student at science. Imagine that even after more than 20yrs I still look at news and papers on science. Way before this covid. </p>
<p>But I also had my share of meeting terrible, bad, doctors and nurses. Who simply read books, prescribed stuff they were told to, and sometimes didn't have a clue about symptoms/causes. Not to mention how governments are corrupt everywhere.</p>
<p>Just having the brains to consider that governments are corrupt and there's bad and good doctors, should be enough for anyone to doubt the narrative they are being told on tv.</p>
<p>Deep down, I wish, really wish the teams that the governments chose to conduct the development we're seeing, are good, humble, true and loyal to the patients and their studies and beliefs. But, I've witnessed too much and studied how easily humans can be corrupted, so no, I don't believe they hold our best interests first. While some theories are a bit too much, not all of it is.</p>
