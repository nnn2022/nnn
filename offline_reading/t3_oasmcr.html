<p>I recently watched the first Lord of the Rings film, The Fellowship of the Ring, with my kids for their first time. At the park today, one of them asked me about the vision Frodo sees in Galadriel's Mirror - a vision of his homeland, the Shire, being ravaged by enemies. "Does that happen later in the story?" I answered that it does happen later in the books but was left out of the movies because they were already so long. But in the book, the heroes of the story, the four Hobbits, come home to a land that has been taken over by enemies and become unrecognizable. Everything is changed for the worse. But they rally the citizenry and overthrow the evil leaders and start the work of setting things to rights again.</p>
<p>That chapter of the last volume of the Lord of the Rings is called, "The Scouring of the Shire" and you can read in here online if you want: <a href="https://ae-lib.org.ua/texts-c/tolkien__the_lord_of_the_rings_3__en.htm#6-08">https://ae-lib.org.ua/texts-c/tolkien__the_lord_of_the_rings_3__en.htm#6-08</a></p>
<p>On the drive home from the park, I was thinking about Hobbits. And I was thinking about Canadians. And how the American stereotype of them is that they're so nice and kind. Canadians are like the Hobbits of our world, I thought. Wholesome, happy people. But then I started thinking about the search helicopters that were recently sent out in Canada to track down a Christian pastor and his congregation who went to meet in the wilderness since they were forbidden to meet in their church. And how that pastor was arrested in front of his wife and children and hauled off to jail for daring to worship God in defiance of the government. And I thought of the Canadians posting on here and telling how oppressive things are in Canada right now.</p>
<p>And then I thought: Canada needs a Scouring of the Shire. And let's be honest, so does the USA.</p>
<p>Here's a list of some of the things that I found were happening in the Shire under the oppressive regime of Saruman, one of the evil wizards in the story. Do any of them sound familiar?</p>
<p>* curfews<br>
* speech crime<br>
* redefinition of terms<br>
* "I'm sorry but we have orders"<br>
* rationing<br>
* no house guests allowed<br>
* learned helplessness<br>
* censorship<br>
* consequences for talking bad about leaders<br>
* police organized against citizenry<br>
* travel permission required<br>
* forced government housing<br>
* forced government provided food<br>
* forced relocation<br>
* seizure of homes<br>
* seizure of food and goods<br>
* seizing farmland for cash crops instead of food to benefit the "elite"<br>
* putting dissidents (including the old ones with spirit and wisdom and memory) in the Lockholes<br>
* not allowed to meet in pubs<br>
* a sheriff: "Don't be hard on me. What can I do?"<br>
* "Some like minding other folk's business"<br>
* "If we all got angry together something might be done."<br>
* Ruffian: ‘This country wants waking up (WOKENESS IN LOTR!?) and setting to rights,’ said the ruffian, ‘and Sharkey’s going to do it; and make it hard, if you drive him to it. You need a bigger Boss. And you’ll get one before the year is out, if there’s any more trouble. Then you’ll learn a thing or two, you little rat-folk‘</p>
<p>Here are some of the quotes that stand out to me from this chapter, that remind me of our current situation. (For context, the main heroes in this book at this point are Frodo, Sam (Samwise), Merry (Meriadoc) and Pippin (Peregrin):  </p>
<p>&rt;‘I’ve an idea,’ said Sam. ‘Let’s go to old Tom Cotton’s down South Lane! He always was a stout fellow. And he has a lot of lads that were all friends of mine.’<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
‘No!’ said Merry. ‘<strong>It’s no good “getting under cover</strong>”. That is just what people have been doing, and just what these ruffians like. They will simply come down on us in force, corner us, and then drive us out, or burn us in. No, <strong>we have got to do something at once.</strong>’<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
‘Do what?’ said Pippin.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
‘Raise the Shire!’ said Merry. ‘<strong>Now! Wake all our people! They hate all this, you can see: all of them</strong> except perhaps one or two rascals, and a few fools that want to be important, but don’t at all understand what is really going on. But <strong>Shire-folk have been so comfortable so long they don’t know what to do. They just want a match, though, and they’ll go up in fire.</strong> The Chief’s Men must know that. They’ll try to stamp on us and put us out quick. <strong>We’ve only got a very short time.</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Sam said, ‘We’re going to clear out these ruffians, and their Chief too. We’re starting now.’<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
‘Good, good!’ cried Farmer Cotton. ‘So it’s begun at last! <strong>I’ve been itching for trouble all this year, but folks wouldn’t help.</strong> And I’ve had the wife and Rosie to think of.’</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;‘Seems almost too easy after all, don’t it?’ said Cotton. ‘I said we could master them. <strong>But we needed a call.</strong> You came back in the nick o’ time, Mr. Merry.’</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;‘<strong>This is worse than Mordor!</strong>’ said Sam. ‘<strong>Much worse in a way. It comes home to you, as they say; because it is home, and you remember it before it was all ruined.</strong>’<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
‘Yes, this is Mordor,’ said Frodo. ‘Just one of its works. Saruman was doing its work all the time, even when he thought he was working for himself. And the same with those that Saruman <strong>tricked</strong>, like Lotho.’</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Frodo (to Saruman the evil wizard): ‘Go at once and never return!’<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The hobbits of the villages had seen Saruman come out of one of the huts, and at once they came crowding up to the door of Bag End. When they heard Frodo’s command, they murmured angrily:<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;‘Don’t let him go! Kill him! He’s a villain and a murderer. Kill him!’<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Saruman looked round at their hostile faces and smiled. ‘Kill him!’ he mocked. ‘Kill him, if you think there are enough of you, my brave hobbits!’ He drew himself up and stared at them darkly with his black eyes. ‘But do not think that when I lost all my goods I lost all my power! Whoever strikes me shall be accursed. And if my blood stains the Shire, it shall wither and never again be healed.’<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The hobbits recoiled. But Frodo said: ‘<strong>Do not believe him! He has lost all power, save his voice that can still daunt you and deceive you, if you let it.</strong> But I will not have him slain. It is useless to meet revenge with revenge: it will heal nothing. Go, Saruman, by the speediest way!’</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's not quite the same as our situation. But if you love Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, maybe it can be an inspiration for you. A seed crystal or catalyst for thought and reflection that can spur you to action.</p>
<p>We need a Scouring of Canada. We need a Scouring of America. Each of us or each group of us can't do the job of scouring our whole nation on our own. But we can Scour our Neighborhood. We can Scour our Town, or our Suburb, or our City. Sometimes we need to start with Scouring our own Mind.</p>
<p>Sound the Horn of Alarm in Toronto, in Portland, in Seattle, in LA with its re-lockdown, in Albuquerque, in New York, in London, in Sydney, and everywhere else where wizards of deception and fear have spread their corrupting influence and doubt and oppression and tyranny.</p>
<p>Band together in real life, not just whispering discontentment virtually on the internet, but coming together physically in action and solidarity with those around you who believe as you do, who remember the old America from two years ago, the old Canada, the old England, the old Australia, the old New Zealand.</p>
<p>Put together a group of friends and family to meet at the grocery store and all shop mask-less together. Let people see the glory of your human faces and remember!</p>
<p>Do what you can to get groups of people together: a block party, a book club, a Bible study, a hike in nature. Gather together and remind each other what it is to be human, to be part of a community, not to be isolated, but to be connected.</p>
<p>Find like-minded people that you can do things with, both for community, and for unified, healing action against the deception and against the tyranny.</p>
<p>Don't let your city and your country become Mordor, or the Iron Curtain, or a dystopia. Push back! Push back together! Be the match that lights the fire of resistance where you are. Be the memory of how things were just two years ago for the people around you who have forgotten. Act quickly for yourselves and your posterity, before it's too late, so that your community, your nation might have a new birth of freedom!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you have ideas of how to organize, how to unite, how to act in solidarity to push back in the real world in your communities, please share with us here.</p>
<p>Have you already done something that works? Have you already lit a match for resistance and freedom? Share your stories here!</p></p>
