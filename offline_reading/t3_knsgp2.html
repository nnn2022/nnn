    <strong>"The lockdowns would've worked/we wouldn't need another lockdown if everyone had complied".</strong>
    <p><p>This seems to be the argument that is used the most, so knowing how to refute it is absolutely vital.</p>
<p>What would be your response?</p></p>

        <p>Well the real answer is no one knows what would be. I bet no one even knows what effect the measures have as they are, of course they have to tell us the measures work etc. which they are doing diligently. And from the opposite side you got the "counterattack" of look here, masks make things worse, which I think are also probably not exactly grounded in reality... more in the political opinion.</p>
<p>Maybe just politely ask them how them know what would be?</p>

        <p>There was a great post on one of these subreddits recently about "unfalsifiable claims," and how this kind of statement essentially makes it impossible to disprove it. If you search it I'm sure you can find it, but this is the logic being employed:</p>
<p>"If a lockdown is implemented and numbers go down, then it's the lockdown working as expected and it should continue."</p>
<p>"If a lockdown is implemented and numbers do not go down, then it's not the fault of the lockdown (insert blame external factor here) and we need to continue the lockdown or impose harsher measures."</p>
<p>And finally when all else fails, "if no lockdown measures seem to be helping numbers go down, assume that numbers would have been even higher if a lockdown was not imposed, therefore we should continue the lockdown."</p>
<p>If you can't falsify a claim, then you can't study it or measure its effectiveness, which also makes it impossible to argue against. So keep that in mind, that a lot of people who are pushing the narrative have already decided in their minds that a lockdown is the only answer and nothing you will say will convince them otherwise. The best defense you have is to give them the benefit of the doubt that lockdowns work, but ask them what their idea is for measuring their success, measuring their failure, what should be the exit criteria if it's successful, and what should be the next step if it is not? Putting in these conditions might get that person to realize that they don't actually have any concrete rational basis for prolonged lockdowns.</p>

        <p>It’s the human factor. Unless they want to start locking people in prison for not following the rules, they will never be effective. A mask is only effective when worn properly. When the mask is used repeatedly and stored in the pocket and whatever these freaks are doing with them, they become significantly less effective. Something like this can not be mandated and enforced in a society of human beings. To many variables, and not enough DEFINITIVE evidence a SOCIETAL MASK MANDATE is effective at doing anything other than extreme divide, tribal behavior, and the serious psychological damage all of this will do especially to children. Masks working in a lab doesn’t mean anything when we’re talking about a society wearing masks to slow the spread of a virus. Yes in theory it would work. But like I said the human factor is the Achilles heal and it will never work. Period. Of course the powers that be are fully aware of this. The mask thing is not about keeping anyone safe. It’s absolutely about division, control, and fear. If you truly believe otherwise at this point you are not reading between the lies and you are a victim as we all are to some extent, it’s up to you to accept reality and live your life as an individual who thinks for themselves.</p>

        <p>That’s speculation. You can’t go saying this turn of events coulda, woulda, shoulda been that turn of events. We can only control ourselves. Once we return our control within ourselves, and stop trying to control others through guilt, blame, gossip, shame, etc, we can begin to have inner peace. With that in mind, I’d say don’t worry about others’ compliance, just worry about you and what you can do stay healthy and fit.</p>

        <p>I'd say something like this:</p>
<p>If it requires perfect compliance to work, then it's never going to work, and you need a different strategy. The <em>best</em> time for compliance was March and April... before the the BLM protests that health care workers were cheering on, before dozens of high-level politicians were caught ignoring their own rules, before studies came out showing asymptomatic spread is rare to non-existent, before millions of people were shoved into poverty by lockdowns. If you didn't get the perfect obedience you wanted back in March, you're definitely not going to get it now.</p>
