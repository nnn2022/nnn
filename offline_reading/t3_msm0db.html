<p>For those who haven't read it please do, I thought this was fake until they announced that interprovincial travel is banned. I want to leave and have a second citizenship but I'm 16 and my parents are liberal, how can I show them this without them thinking I'm an insane conspiracy theorist? So far they have supported the lockdowns however my dad doesn't want the vaccine so maybe he would take me seriously. If anyone has advice then it would be really appreciated because I don't want to be here when they put non vaccinated people on the no fly list.</p></p>

        <p>Not sure that at 16 you are going to have much sway with convincing your parents. Having said that the leaked document should be essential reading for everyone. The more people that are aware of this, the more pushback there will be to implementation. Push back does work. Remember recently when Merkel was going to lock down Easter in Germany. The response was too unamamous and she claimed she had made a mistake and that it wasn't necessary after all.</p>
<p>A mistake. No, she had orders to implement the lock down and she did. Then the feedback looked like it would push too far and the order was pulled. This is a sychological game of cat and mouse, carrot... Stick etc.</p>
<p>If it makes you feel better I know that the author of that post is up North in Canada right now.</p>

        <p>might not help you in getting out, but you should share the document.  </p>

<p>A LOT of people thought it was crazy when it was leaked late last year, but after EVERY SINGLE point came true and continues to come true, it is hard for people to dismiss it as crazy now (especially after yesterday!)</p>

        <p>Do you have monetary means? Where is your second citizenship? If I were you I'd get the fuck out, parents be damned.</p>
<p>Not to be dramatic but Canada is basically a proxy to the CCP right now. We are entering an era of worldwide turmoil we've not seen in almost a century. In the grand scheme of things, 16 is not too young to make a fresh start.</p>
<p>Imagine you're in Europe and World War One breaks out. Does fleeing to avoid the draft really seem unreasonable, even at a young age?</p>
<p>Good luck friend.</p>
