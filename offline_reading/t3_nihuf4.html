    <strong>seems to me, this is the real shot for libertarians</strong>
    <p><p>for the past 50 years, libertarians have been fringe players in politics. with all the covid lockdown stuff, seems like this could be the one chance these guys have to go mainstream. I never even thought about them until this year tbh but now im watching everything dave smith does. </p>
<p>sorry I know it sounds like a shill post. im honestly not a political person. just think it's interesting and I'm curious if anyone else is like "oh shit, these guys really aren't crazy"?</p></p>

        <p>People are herd creatures. If we weren't the government couldn't pull a "great lie" on folks. </p>
<p>Leaving the herd makes people feel lost and even knowing the herd is moving in the wrong direction is more comforting than moving in the right direction alone, so over the cliff folks go.</p>

        <p>This.</p>
<p>It is in our psychology to follow a herd as we use the "this many people can't be wrong".</p>
<p>Anyone who has learnt about IQ and the fact 75% of the population is barely above average to disabled statistically means the majority should not be followed.</p>

        <p>I think that more people previously divided by the dem/repub
Kabooki theater are coming to the realization that both sides are just sellouts, and that the realist and non-invasive objectives of what really represents them. This is all much to the chagrin of the establishment, because they have long used their tactics of division by polarization through the hustle of paradigms that have little to do with actual issues... such as race/politics, in order to keep us from uniting to dethrone the real plutocrats...</p>

        <p>So much can be accomplished or destroyed through messaging and when it involves media services who have political agendas then the deck is already stacked against any viable alternative to the "divide and conquer" two-party game being played.  Good discussion though.</p>

        <p>I'm part of a sort of "libertarian" group here in Canada.</p>
<p>Every single one of these so called hardcore "government must be destroyed" libertarian anarchist types, who were beating their chest just two years ago, are now all staying at home and are <em>all for the covid-19 measures</em>.</p>
<p>As far as I'm concerned, they are no longer qualified to call themselves "libertarian" anymore.  In my opinion, they have exposed themselves as massive hypocrites.</p>

        <p>yeah I dont know much about it. just learnjng now bc of covid. but some core points stick out... move federal power to the state/local level, balance spending, stop corp bailouts, stop incarciration for nonviolent offenders, stop with the interventionist war stuff, fuck covid lockdown.</p>
<p>if there's some other anarchist radical stuff, I dont know about that yet but that's not really my bag.</p>

        <p>The problem is you are looking towards a POLITICAL party to espouse a view that essentially, they (government or those who aspire to it) are useless at best and evil in general.</p>
<p>It is a viewpoint that is against their own self interest. They will only pay lip service to it at best while asking for votes to attain that same power that shouldn't even exist.</p>

        <p>I dunno im just getting into it myself, but pretty sure Dave Smith is a mainstream player in the libertarian space. regardless, I'm not sure what your comment does to further the dialogue apart from a patronizing, dismissive: "I follow politics and I don't know him". like you're the authority on the subject. lol, you're just another random reddit goon like me. im not an expert, but I just wanted coversation. add to it or dont I guess.</p>

        <p>I just think Libertarians are completely irrelevant to American politics. That was my only point. You could be right about Dave Smith, I don't know, I've just never heard of them. I guess I can see how my comment could be condescending. I'm sorry if it came off that way.</p>

        <p>oh it's ok. I get your jist now. and I know they are pretty irrelevant. I just wonder if more people are gonna get turned on to them after the whole ignoring of the bill of rights thing that kinda happened. not that theyll be a mainstream party or anything but I kinda started turning my ear to it. just wondered if they were gsining traction. </p>
<p>also, thanks for not being a dick with the reply. seldom happens on reddit haha</p>

        <p>No problem. Reddit often tends to bring out the worst in people, me sometimes too. One of the other parties would have to collapse, and even then there wouldn't be any guarantee of Libertarians filling the void. Maybe if the Democrats pass more legislation like ranked-choice voting or other election reforms, then third parties could have more opportunities to actually win.</p>

        <p>It entirely depends on the politician in almost all cases. I mean there's literally no Republican I would ever vote for, at least in the modern day. But for Libertarians, some of them seem like good people. You're never going to find the perfect party or the perfect politician, you just have to pick the person that you think is going to do the least worst job. That's how you better society, there are so many people in this world trying to make Society worse, you take any positive change you can get. The reason I vote for Democrats is because they actually show a willingness to make good changes. There's certainly things I don't agree with, but they're the only major party still committed to our democratic institutions.</p>

        <p>yeah I was a democrate for 20 years. my dad ran the local polls in our district. I was straight ticket but I quit after all the censoring and totalitarian stuff they've done lately. I mean they were always (in my generation) lacking idenity and just were antithesis of the GOP on all fronts and unfortunately that just became their entire cause now. extreme opposition to the GOP. now they have power, they dont have a clue what to do with it and are so terrified of losing it, they just silence every dissenting voice. I really cant be apart of that anymore.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry, I can't relate to any of that. What are they doing that's totalitarian? I would also argue that it sounds like you're describing the GOP more than the Democrats. In 2020 the Republicans didn't even have a policy platform at all, they literally are just against whatever the Democrats are for. The Democrats at least come up with actual ideas, you know? Even if I don't agree with them all.</p>

        <p>Clearly they’re powerless, if that’s what you mean by irrelevant. Which is funny cause most parties claim libertarians are powerful or spoilers or something.</p>
<p>But in any case yea Dave Smith is relatively well-known within libertarian circles, at least in my opinion. He’s a Mises type dude. Knows his stuff and knows how to communicate it.</p>

        <p>They can both be politically irrelevant and spoilers. I don't think these things are mutually exclusive. In our political system you have to have a majority to get anything done, and Libertarians will never have a majority. What a spoiler just means, is that you take away votes from your second favorite choice to give it to your first favorite choice, which then ends up making your least favorite choice win.</p>
<p>I will look into Dave Smith! But I don't really hold far-right economic views. Thanks for bringing him to my attention though! 😊</p>
