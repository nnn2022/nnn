    <strong>Mask Efficacy and Virus Size</strong>
    <p><p>I saw someone comment on a post about masks and the size of the virus and the person said that since coronavirus is spread through droplets, why does the virus size matter? i have my own skepticism about mask efficacy and the implementation of masks, but i was wondering how that works.</p></p>

        <p>The likely true purpose of masks is less medical and more psychological- to keep the wearer and the people within view aware that there's a crisis... and on edge.  There's more risk with mask wearing- hands more frequently touching it and the fact to adjust an uncomfortable covering.  Virus size, droplets, etc., are irrelevant.</p>

        <p>Weapons-grade misinformation, yes! Really great article you linked there, much appreciated.</p>
<p>I think the phrase "elites" needs to be eliminated, because it appears to endorse their narcissistic sense of superiority. I prefer to refer to them as the parasite class.</p>
<p>As that article so eloquently stated, the whole of the parasite class' strategy is to sow chaos and discord among us to distract from the collapse of their fiat currency debt-based system.</p>
<p>They have made several fatal miscalculations though, and they will be defeated in time. First among their mistakes, I think, is that they do not understand what it is to be human. They were able to manipulate people into seeing one another as threats, and able to link compliance with "compassion" at first ('if you care about whether you kIll GraNdMas you will mask, isolate, and shoot an untested probable bioweapon into  your arm').  </p>
<p>Over time true human compassion is going to win.</p>
<p>People are going to stop being willing to sacrifice their human connections in service of the state's agenda. I'm seeing it all around me already, and I live in a fascistic blue state. I think the fact that people love one another and want to be with one another is hard-wired into us, and cannot be over-ridden by decree forever. Even the most mind-controlled doomers are eventually going to listen to their connecting instinct. The sociopathic wannabe-kings don't have a connecting instinct, so they don't understand its power.</p>

        <p>Virus size and mask porosity is a legitimate but ephemeral argument at this point. The world has enough data among highly mask compliant populations vs non-mask wearing populations to evaluate mask effectiveness in preventing viral spread. </p>
<p>Spoiler alert: the 20 plus years of virus vs. mask data is ....... wait for it ...... valid!!! </p>
<p>No actual mitigation effect of general population mask wearing</p>

        <p>If you hold up a fabric mask to the light you'll notice how porous it is. And that's my personal reason for me not believing in the efficiency of cloth masks. Even medical grade masks aren't effective if not worn correctly. And the majority of the people wearing them are not wearing them correctly.</p>
<p>However masks DO seem to be really effective for criminals wishing to conceal their identity and making it easier to commit a crime.</p>

        <p>This is the heart of why they think we are so dumb, it seens like common sense. You see fluids fly out your mouth/nose sometimes and it instinctively  (not scientifically, even though they claim to love science its a gut feeling they are going on) seems smart to stop it. Scientifically though a droplet has wide range of size, and it can be very small. 
They can also easily travel around any gaps of a mask. People psychlogically think thats just a little bit it shouldnt matter, but really its a huge amount. 
People think viral load matters more than it does, what is more important is infectious load and then how likely a person is to get sick. Elderly already ill people might only need a tiny bit to die from it. 
Covid has also been shown to spread by aerosol so droplets arent as important. Lastly there have been some of the studies that show (and it makes scientific sense) that as you breathe, due to friction and the mask's construction,  droplets are forced to move along the mask and could make droplets become much smaller and even aerosolize them.
