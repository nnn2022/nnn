<p>This is a petition released by the Union of graduate students. Grad students are officially unionized.</p>
<p>Previously, the university ruled on a 1 year suspension for a Chinese international student who misunderstood university policy and was sheltering in place because his mother is sick. This would have led to the cancellation of his visa and the deportation of him and his mother.</p>
<p>After the news stepped in, the university had "new information" and downgraded his punishment to probation. The Graduate union noted that the committee was well aware of this information.</p>

<p>Both students have expressed that they were told they were not allowed to share details of the disciplinary hearing to the public or else they would be punished.</p></p>
