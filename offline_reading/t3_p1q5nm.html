    <strong>Religious exemption update</strong>
    <p><p>Hey everyone, I just wanted to share this with you guys here as I'm sure many of you are probably in a similar position. Let me preface by saying I drove an entire day Sunday from New York to Tennessee and I'm staying at Dolly Parton's Resort on vacation in a desperate attempt to pretend life is normal and still enjoyable LOL  I'm saying this because I'm not going to be able to respond a lot in this thread as I'm very busy right now and trying to avoid depressing negative things but I will Def check back when I can later. </p>
<p>I am in New York City, I work in healthcare and I know mandates are coming. I don't do direct patient care right now in my current position but I know many places are mandating for everyone anyway. I know this is coming. I'm not taking this shot. I had at a meeting with a wonderful attorney yesterday who has been doing this since 2014 and it went really well and she knows her stuff. I am claiming religious exemption. I am not a religious phony I actually am religious and I grew up in the church and read the Bible and I do believe in God.</p>
<p>So here's the thing, if you are going to claim this and you're in New York even though there are no religious exemptions allowed in New York state you are still protected by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This protects you against religious discrimination so it doesn't matter that there is no religious exemption because your personal interpretation of the Bible and your interpretation cannot be challenged. Those are your personal religious beliefs, KEY HERE... PERSONAL RELIGIOUS BELIEFS this is what you're claiming in your exemption. You're not speaking about any science or philosophical beliefs, you're just talking about your interpretation of God's word and what it means in your life and you're going to relate it to vaccines and taking vaccines.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if you've had previous vaccines. I have had plenty because they were required of me in college and at work at certain points. I honestly was not aware of all that goes into these things and honestly if I knew I don't think I would have taken them before. There have been times when I have declined and when she looked at my vaccination Record She said I can already tell you don't like them because you took titers for a lot of them and you have declined some that weren't necessary. That's another thing, you have to reconcile why you took vaccines previously if you did. And you can't say I took them under duress I didn't want to because then they can just say well then you can do the same thing with this. It's just best to stay away from that, you have to explain why you decided not to do this anymore. And it's for all vaccines and not just for this one. </p>
<p>You just have to explain why you're no longer doing this and it can't be related to any science or philosophical beliefs. Example, you were having dinner with a friend and you started talking about vaccines and your friend informed you of a lot of things you were unaware of. MRNA vaccines use fetal kidney cells to culture those vaccines and test them. They extract the kidneys out of live fetuses during abortions and that's what they're using to test that vaccine so it doesn't matter if there are no fetal cells in the vaccine it's the testing that goes against the sanctity of human life. Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine actually has fetal tissue cells from the eyes of aborted babies. There are actual links to a government or vaccine manufacturer website that state these things, I don't have these links the attorney who's helping me is sending them to me to  back up what I am saying with facts. She instructed me to add those links in my letter. I am then going to use scripture about sanctity of human life and respecting human life from conception to Natural death Etc. Not going to go into all that there but you get the idea.</p>
<p>Do not copy a template offline do NOT do this. Many places can easily Google this stuff and it makes you look bad and you'll be rejected. You have to personalize it. The structure should be as follows..... your background, what is your background with your religion, how is it played a part in your life. Your family? Your childhood? Details about your faith. What it means to you, how it has been a part of your life. Example , my father died when I was five, my mother suffered alcoholism we became part of a church community that helped raise me and helped my mother in her recovery and I experienced God through the people of my church congregation etc. Make it really personal. Then you are going to talk about your Awakening, how did you find out about vaccines and how they go against your faith. That is the fetal tissue stuff. Also we are made in God's image, we are perfect as we are, defiling your blood with  man-made  substances that did not come from the hand of God is a disrespect of God's creation and a disrespect of God as your healer. There are many Bible verses about this you can look up. Also you want to make clear that you are not against medical intervention but medical intervention on a healthy body is a different thing. Vaccines inject into a healthy body.</p>
<p>Lastly your reason for not doing this which is it violates the sanctity of Life, the sanctity of blood and it betrays your faith in God. These are basic things you should have in your letter if you're doing this. This is not a joke, you can't make it just one short page and not really go into details here. She also said don't put in anything about mask and testing being exempt as well for various reasons.</p>
<p>This woman is getting between 100 to 200 emails a day from people that are scrambling. City workers, cops, firefighters, teachers, Healthcare professionals, parents who are afraid for their children. There are many many people that are against this and do not want to do it. I got a small glimpse of this attorneys in box and the titles of the emails being sent to her were heartbreaking, "desperate please help me, please help me and my child, I was just fired can you help me.", etc.. If you are panicking... know that you are not alone. And if you are really concerned I would recommend hiring someone who specializes in this to look over your letter and give you a few tips and pointers.</p>
<p>Good luck everyone... DO NOT GIVE UP. If this was easy everyone would be doing it, you have chosen the hard way but standing up for your rights and bodily autonomy is essential now or it will only get worse from here. </p>
<p>EDIT... forgot to add this for you guys, I used the handbook this listed here in a link on this website. It gives you an idea of structure and things to focus on. Do not copy it, the attorney I used told me she has seen this copied all over the internet even in Italian just do not copy this you had to make it your own but I used the things discussed here to help me begin a letter</p>

        <p>◄ Revelation 13:17 ►
16 And poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, 17 so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark— the name of the beast or the number of its name. 18Here is a call for wisdom: Let the one who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and that number 666.</p>
<p>Revelation 14:11
And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.</p>
<p>Revelation 20:4
Then I saw the thrones, and those seated on them had been given authority to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or its image, and had not received its mark on their foreheads or hands. And they came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.</p>

        <p>Prayer of Saint Francis</p>
<p>Lord, make me an instrument of your peace.
Where there is hatred, let me sow love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is doubt, faith; where there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; and where there is sadness, joy.
O Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console; to be understood as to understand; to be loved as to love. For it is in giving that we receive; it is in pardoning that we are pardoned; and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>

        <p>Protip: In principle, Judaism interprets “and your brother will live <em>with you</em>” (Leviticus 25:36) as implying that your life takes precedence over others’, i.e. you are not obligated to risk your own life to save someone else’s. (In practice, alas, many Jewish institutions seem to have forgotten about this.) If my medical exemption fails to pan out I plan to fall back on this.</p>

        <p>Thank you for this!  I was raised Catholic, and this crisis has really made me revisit that tradition and think about what it means to me.  I think a lot of us have examined our personal spiritual paths and relationship with God during this crisis.</p>
