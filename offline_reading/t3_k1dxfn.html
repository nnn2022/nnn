<p>Things  don't happen by chance in a world controlled by a few people. No  country would be allowed to go on their own in this pandemic unless they  played a specific role. I hope those with an open mind can see the  deception and how they make all sort of excuses while the rest of the  world loses their freedoms and small businesses are destroyed. They live  an almost normal life with no face masks and no strict lockdowns while  keeping their economy almost unaffected. This cannot happen by chance  and I hope people can see it.</p></p>
