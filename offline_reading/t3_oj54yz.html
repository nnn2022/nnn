        <p>Either it's purely about contrl and special interests... or there really was a release of a unique bio-weapon. Although I think most who talk about "long covid" are full of shit, there may be something there in regard to "pions" and their effect on brain shit. It's way over my head but I'm working on learning more. </p>
<p>For all we know, it'll turn out safer to get the jab than to get the coof but I'm not taking sanctioned anecdotes or people's word for it. I need this to be proven before I make this irreversible decision.</p>
<p>Maybe it's a 40% chance of a bad outcome without the vax, and a 10% chance with the vax. 10% still wouldn't be good, but it would be better than 40%. However, it took over a year for the media to acknowledge any kind of "lab leak hypothesis' and they still  haven't' followed the facts to their logical conclusions. Once the media started, it still took weeks for them to all get on board and parrot but they haven't delved deeper. Sure <em>The Hill</em> (when Sagaar and Krystal did the show) talked abit about the connection between the NIH, and the gain of function research at the WIV. </p>
<p>Last year a friend retorted to my concern about the lab hypothesis, "I read a NY Times article which says it didn't come from a lab..." So I responded by saying "I don't think it was <em>made</em> in a lab, but that they tinkered with a natural virus in a lab and enhanced." He was able to agree or acknowledge that as a reasonable point, but I basically said the same thing as "it came from a lab."</p>
<p>As I continue to get a clearer picture (or so I think), the possibility of bioweapon lab origin is pretty strong. Now, <strong>think about it like this</strong> for just a moment... </p>
<p>If those in power are aware that this was a bioweapon release, this could explain some aspects of the urgency. It could even be racially targeted. Anyway, PCR tests on their own aren't reliable at high cycle counts, and it's really pointless to be going out of our way to identify asymptomatic infections... <strong>unless the goal of PCR tests is to track this bioweapon</strong>. Hence the insistence on downloading the contact-tracing app. </p>
<p>When my sibling went for a covid test he said they were ery insistent about the app. It wasn't' required, but the staff at the test center were clearly pushing it.</p>
<p>Anyway, my 40%/10% risk figure is irrelevant without truthful answers. Since the media has been full of shit (deflections, character assassination, outright lies, selective truth/propaganda). </p>
<p>However, if this is not about tracking a bioweapon release, then it is a power-grab. I mean it could be both, but without knowing the truth about this virus, I'm not given any real reason to get the vax.</p>
<p>"Stay cool, wait it out."</p>
<p>It should be noted that the old swine flu vaccine was recalled way earlier for way less reason than these vaccines. The Swine Flu vaccine of 1976 killed 25 people and another 400+ (<a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2009-apr-27-sci-swine-history27-story.html">or 500</a>).</p>

        <p>&rt; That they all threw away standard protocols and followed the weird 'Quarantine the healthy" approach suggests something, even if I cannot say quite what.</p>
<p>Exactly. Many of us agreed that this didn't make any sense.. but if the virus was a bioweapon release, then this might actually make a whole lot of sense. At least that's more or less what I got out of Dr. McCairn (PhD, <a href="https://www.mccairndojo.com">McCairnDojo.com</a>.  He does livestreams on YouTube but usually takes down the vid/puts it as unlisted in order to avoid account strikes from YT.</p>
<p>McCairn believes that we (the people in the U.S. and other parts of the civilized world) would understand if the governments played it straight with us. Like if they said, "this what it is and we really don't know what we're doing, which is why we are pushing masks, distancing, and quarantining the healthy."</p>
<p>Now, me personally, I don't think being told "we don't know" would go too well. Maybe it wouldn't result in pandemonium but looks, our trust is already destroyed. If they said "we don't know" how many conspiracy theories would be people think up based on that? </p>
<p>So I dunno, I'm just spit-balling other people's ideas and trying to imagine scenarios.</p>

        <p>Regardless of how it all started, my concern now is governments have seen how easily people roll over and comply with ridiculous demands, so it's them on a roll now - over us.</p>
<p>Creeps like Claus Scab are wetting themselves over the chance to impose a One World Government over the planet, with 'vaccine passports' that over-ride national passports, even when in your home country. </p>
<p>To me that's the point of this NNN sub, to figure out how to resist that, how to inform others etc.</p>

        <p>It's so nice of you to conflate the legal definition with the common use definition (which is a large part and basis for the laws in this country). Yes, you have the right to travel, so hitch up your wagon and go wherever you please, but the LAWS in this country state, if you travel, by means of a motor vehicle, of which you are the operator (which is where the common use, non-law book definition comes into play), upon a highway, you must be in possession of a valid driver's license. It's not "corporate law" (whatever the fuck that is), it's right there, in the statutory laws of each state, right along with laws concerning burglary, assault, theft, etc. Unless of course, you're actually insane enough to think that those laws also don't apply because they're "corporate law" as well.</p>

        <p>Dudes a fucking moron, and a fascist scumbag. He was condoning people getting pulled out of their cars, and having dogs sic’d on them, just for not wanting to be under contract, and under the jurisdiction of commercial law, being enforced by a policy officer. People have the right to travel, and not to be subjugated, and harassed by a corporation if they are not harming anyone, or someone’s property. The whole judicial system is a scam.</p>
<p>As far as the Nazis go…I believe they were a tool used by the Vatican, and the Rothchilds, to bring about the creation of Israel. I believe Hitler was in on it. So, fuck them haha.

        <p>I never said I want it, but when it happens to brain-dead sovcits like you who don't understand basic laws (not your unicorn fart magic fairy dust interpretation of law) I get a big kick out of it. It's one of the prime examples of playing stupid games and winning stupid prizes. It doesn't happen to nice, upstanding, good natured folks, it's always moronic, narcissistic sovcit dolts that claim others don't have authority over them and that the rules don't apply to them because they're "enlightened." One of your kind killed a very good cop near where I grew up, so no, I have no sympathy when people like you act like overgrown toddlers around police and get your window smashed, dragged out and hauled away to jail for something that 99 times out of 100 would have just resulted in a ticket. You call me dumb, but you can't understand the basic fucking concept of state statutes.</p>

        <p>Exactly....Same as “it’s for your safety”. They’ll probably take all children away from “Unvaccinated” families and help educate them properly. Probably also ask the public to do “their due diligence” and oust whoever they know isn’t vaccinated.</p>

        <p>Yup, and the forces/individuals that are driving this slow march towards a totalitarian world government don’t even have to lift a finger. The masses will be turned against the unvaccinated and they will do their work for them. It’s already starting; people are being primed to view the unvaxxed as a threat to humanity itself, when little to they know the actual threat are the institutions that claim to want what’s best for them.</p>
