    <strong>People need to see that quality of life is better than quantity!</strong>
    <p><p>Slightly off-topic, but seriously modern society has become obsessed with living forever. This means not doing anything risky, irrationally fearing terrorism, seasonal flu, cancer etc. It means people aren't enjoying the simple pleasures of life more. Standing in the rain, hugging a loved one, walking in the woods, enjoying a glass of wine. All these things that make life great, through one way an another are slowly being eroded for 'safety and health' concerns,  but if you took me to the side and said:</p>
<p>Look u/stayhomebigot, you can either live to a ripe old age, but you can only achieve this by avoiding anything with a moderate level of risk and not leaving your house at weekends. Or, you can only  live to 30, but experience all of life's simple pleasures freely. I'd consider it, but I would always eventually choose the second option. Because quality if life&rt; longevity anyday.</p>
<p>Which is my point with these never ending lockdowns. Do we want kids to be completely safe cradle to grave, but never take risks and always treat them as if they are carrying the black death? It not just with lockdowns, its with the modern health and safety measures in general.  We are raising a generation of psychologically damaged children wrapped in cotton wool since birth with no conception of freedom of will or choice. Its like the govt. are playing over-protective parent for some reason.</p>
<p>Also, notice how hunter-gatherers only lived to 30, but seemed to have much more fulfilling lives?</p></p>

        <p>Exactly. I hate when I mention how shitty the lockdowns are for my mental health and doomers say ‘you’re still young’. I’m not going to be young forever. Being locked up inside a house 24/7 isn’t going to preserve my youth, in fact it’s only taking it away. </p>
<p>I don’t see the appeal of living to a point where I’m bed-ridden. I’d rather live a fun, happy life and die at age 25-30 than live 100 years in solitary confinement. </p>
<p>If the ability to have fun, meet new people, celebrate holidays and party with friends is too much to ask, then give me euthanasia and take me off your prison planet please. </p>
<p>Why would you even want to live if you’re too scared to do anything with your life? </p>
<p>II’d rather be dead than exist in a life of constant fear and worry. You could get struck by lightning next time you step outside, but that shouldn’t stop you. You could trip and break your skull on the curb next time you take a walk, but that shouldn’t stop you.</p>
<p>I was always the type of kid to take crazy dares and lick gross stuff just to impress my friends, and guess what? I’m still healthy. </p>
<p>Can’t believe that any of this even needs to be said. It’s like we’re speaking to actual toddlers.</p>

        <p>This isn’t off topic at all. That’s why people wrote the constitution and the declaration of human rights. To prevent this from happening. It’s literally why WWII was fought. To protect freedom and democracy. There’s absolutely no reason to live your life if you can’t live it freely. Freedom from tyranny is the most basic human right. </p>
<p>And all these people want to give it up for perceived safety. It’s sad.</p>

        <p>The good news is, in this context, we don't have to choose. This virus isn't deadly enough that chosing to enjoy life is more dangerous than staying home all the time. You can have both!</p>
<p>The bad news is, the choice is being made for us by other people.</p>

        <p>It’s schizophrenic too.  The In and Out lines in CA look like they are 40 cars deep.  There food can’t be good for you and is probably going to ultimately be a cause of death for a few of their customers.</p>

        <p>I find it hilarious that this entire sub hates censorship and all of that which you are right in, but when you see something that you don’t agree with, you show false sources, nothing backing up your arguement, and then tell people with a different opinion to go away</p>
