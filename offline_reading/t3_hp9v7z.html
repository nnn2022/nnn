    <strong>People's nonchalance over the lockdowns/"pandemic"/New Normal is so disturbing</strong>
    <p><p>I was browsing an entertainment sub that has nothing to do with COVID or news or politics or whatever. COVID came up in conversation because some stuff got delayed. One of the commentors basically said that he expects another lockdown soon that will last "6 to 8 months". People casually agreed, and said they are hoping for it. </p>
<p>I just... Look, I know this is basically the norm right now, but it is so disturbing to see people taking another full lockdown so lightly. It's unbelievable that they act like it's no big deal, and are yearning for more lockdowns, and to last 6+ months. This means they don't even care about the upcoming major holidays like Halloween, Christmas, etc being cancelled. They are just <strong>that</strong> afraid and desensitized. You'd think people would be wary of more lockdowns, but nope!</p></p>

        <p>Anyone who suggests a lockdown for 6 to 8 months has basically zero understanding of economy. Such naiveness is concerning.</p>

        <p>A lot of people have a big misunderstanding and it’s disturbing.  Elon Musk said it best in that these people think the economy is some magical horn of plenty.  That’s not how it’s works. If you want things you have to make things.</p>

        <p>This has always been the case. </p>
<p>I know a lot of people here are more optimistic about the economy recovering soon, but...I think it's too late, there's going to be a lot of fuckery that will need to be dealt with in the coming years... And having more lockdowns will worsen matters moreso.</p>

        <p>You are right.   And when it does recover, most things will be chains, because why would any individual in their right might put their life and money into a business that can be shutdown for months by a capricious health officer.    There was a recent article that 90% of Austin's live music venues will shutdown by Halloween.  That means there is no reason for most tourists to go there.</p>
<p>The other thing that I am worrying about is that in my area schools aren't opening.   And they've basically said it won't be safe until there is a vaccine.   30-50% of our students aren't participating in distance learning.   I think this is going to lead to a very angry and property stricken underclass and also large increases in crime.</p>

        <p>Wait until they lose their job and struggle to keep a roof over their head.   </p>
<p>I am fortunate (as of right now) to have a job and where I can still pay the bills and keep a roof over my head and the family.  I feel for all those who have lost their jobs and businesses (and maybe their purpose in life); it's no fault of their own and circumstances they can't control because the actions of greedy, out of touch governors.</p>

        <p>I think even the most anti police people recognize the need for police to arrest murderers and rapists. In their minds anyone who dares not wear a mask 24/7 or socialize with anyone in person is in that same bucket, so it makes perfect sense.</p>

        <p>Oh wow, the timeless “if you don’t agree with me ur stupid” argument.   Never seen a leftist use that one before!  Just waiting for the “studies show that lockdown skeptics are UGLY” really scientific</p>
<p>Do you not even REMEMBER with your WORKING MEMORY that in the beginning we were told not to buy masks and to save them for hospitals?   And now we are all pretending that never happened and that you were all a bunch of good bois who always wore masks?  So much for the article about poor working memory.</p>

        <p>One odd thing is that the "lockdown" is really a "fake lockdown." All the infrastructure stays up - utilities, food, gas stations, big box stores. That makes it a pleasant lockdown rather than Mad Max.</p>
<p>"People" (privileged people) don't seem to see this.</p>
<p>All the "essential workers" are somehow invisible - like the kid who manages the gas station is somehow not a real person.</p>
<p>If this was a "real pandemic," all the essential workers would die or flee. </p>
<p>What on earth is going on here?</p>

        <p>It's pretty crazy how people can't see it for what it is. They mis-use the term "quarantine" to describe it, or as you aptly pointed out, "lockdown" even though it's not <em>really</em> a lockdown. So what <em>is</em> it, then? We know it's an erosion of personal freedom, rights, sovereignty and privacy. We know it's economic devastation most severely impacting the already most impoverished and disenfranchised people. Hmmmm.</p>

        <p>This is yet another thing they don't understand at all. It's like they have no idea how society works at all...a preschool level understanding of the world.</p>
<p>They also like to LARP that they are part of a terrible ordeal...without it actually being a terrible ordeal. They like to pretend that it's an apocalyptic pandemic because they want to feel like they're in one of those stupid movies. It also makes them feel important, and they feel like they're part of something big, and doing something good. They also seem to be having fun and enjoying it...it's really sickening.  Ironically, they have made it a terrible ordeal with the dystopian hellhole they've turned society into.</p>

        <p>There are Utopian stories, it's just that they usually end up revealed as Dystopias in disguise. And I'm fine with that in fiction, because a Utopia usually won't bring about much conflict to make for an interesting story. Though I think people do romanticize media set in shitholes, and seem to like the idea of living in stories like The Walking Dead. We're supposed to be trying to avert the mistakes made in those stories in order to avoid living in one of those settings. Sigh. People have been disappointing me since I was a child, and continue to do so today...</p>

        <p>One man's trash is another man's treasure, one man's utopia is another man's dystopia. I'd personally rather have the literal apocalypse than even the most "benevolent" police state. If my options are the total collapse of our current civilization like in The Walking Dead, or quarantines and proof-of-vaccination wristbands like in Contagion, I pick TWD. Whether we like it or not, maybe our current civilization is due for a collapse. What goes up must come down.....</p>

        <p>I read a lot of science fiction and I always found it interesting that out of everything I've read, there are barely any that describe a future I would actually want to live in.  Exception being the culture series by Iain M. Banks.  If we took 2 visions of the future, a Star Trek like near-utopia on the one hand and an Elysium (not a great movie but I think a closer vision of where we are heading) style dystopia on the other, we have been on the path to Elysium for ages, I just didn't realise we'd start getting there so quickly.</p>
<p>If we have all decided we want a shitty cyberpunk dystopia though, can we have all the other cool stuff like flying cars, hover boards and matrix-like virtual reality first?  Or how about portals that can take us across massive distances in time and space, so I can leave this planet and form a colony of sane people?</p>

        <p>I think their logic (and what has been broadcast into their minds by political leadership and the media) is that <em>we</em> are prolonging this, that if only we "followed the rules" and just "locked down for a few weeks/months", then this would be over by now. Governor Murphy of New Jersey, for instance, continues to blame "knuckleheads" over having to roll back re-opening indoor dining and whatnot, that if they had followed the rules, then everything would be okay by now. It's manipulation, in order to get what they <em>actually</em> want.</p>

        <p>This narrative they paint really upsets me. They open things back up and then blame people for going places, calling them idiots. What did you think was going to happen, that you were going to open places after closing them for months and people were still going to sit contentedly in their homes? I don’t get the criticism of people going to restaurants and bars. They ARE “following the rules” technically, since the rules are “you can now go to these places.”</p>

        <p>It’s basically delaying the inevitable. The sooner the virus passes through a community, the sooner that community has immunity (however long it is conferred) and the sooner that community can return to close to normal. The WHO just said today that eradicating the virus won’t happen, so we need to learn to live with it. Lockdowns might keep people from getting sick now, but they will get sick eventually because they have no immunity.</p>

        <p>People here keep saying that to me, over and over and over.</p>
<p>I just...don't see it. Not in my area, or in my life in general. For one, I still see shit like this in other subs and social media places, even when it has nothing to do with the virus. It still shows up in conversation eventually, and people's attitudes are as I described here. They don't even express disappointment or anger over cancellations or delays, they just shrug, and are like "I understand, there's a pandemic going on". If something like this happened in 2019, under any other circumstance, people would be pissed their favorite shows and movies got delayed, or events got cancelled.</p>
<p>I also still see a lot of fear, a lot of masks (partly because mandatory in most of the NE now, but also because people here are just terrified and fit in the "demographic" of those in support of lockdowns), public spaces with few people out lately, and so on. It doesn't <em>feel</em> like a "loud minority" to me. Most people seemingly support this stuff, at least around my neck of the woods.</p>

        <p>But the fact most other people are following this "loud minority" doesn't really make the situation any better at all. If the "silent majority" is doing nothing, and also possibly actively participating in this charade then they might as well not exist at all.</p>

        <p>The silent majority are passive, don't wanna deal with trouble, and follow downstream. It's an evolutionary trait, innately fitting in society.             </p>
<p>When someone vocal breaks the current state of opinion then a few wake up. And more and more until there's critical mass. But don't expect a vocal majority until that critical mass is reached.</p>

        <p>It is happening very, very slowly.  Santa Cruz County, for example, gave up on their beach closures because everyone was ignoring their stupid closure.   My county's  health officer, the most insane in the entire county, has started opening things because too many people were driving to nearby open counties and giving them their sales tax dollars.   Just resist wherever you can, and more people will follow.  For example, if somewhere near you is more open, drive there on the weekends and spend money.  I bet Michigan opened sooner because the southern counties are the most populous and tons of people were driving to Indiana and Ohio to do what they want.</p>

        <p>One suggestion...go to places that are open and interact with people.  Lead by example by living your life.  Here in upstate NY, stuff that’s open includes cafes, coffee shops, breweries, wineries, malls, etc.  The people who are out and about are the ones who do not gaf.  I took my daughter to a playground today, saw dozens of families, and I didn’t see one mask, and no one seemed to act any differently than pre-COVID.  Outings like that pull me out of the funk of “everyone is just staying home and taking big bites of this shit sandwich” - there are tons of people back to living normal lives here, they’re just too busy to post about it on Reddit.</p>

        <p>I think going nearby open places is really important.  They can track the raw numbers who do that via various phone tracking things.   Sales tax is important in most states - give your money to places that are open.  Its also a huge pick me up and the best thing you can do for your mental health.   If you can afford it, take a road trip to the national parks in the West.  They are open and beyond beautiful.   Even if you don't like hiking and stuff, many have wonderful sites that you can see from a scenic drive.</p>

        <p>I live in an area where lots of essential workers live.   Despite the Bay Area being absolutely pathetic on opening, people have been having visitors and throwing parties since April.   People can rat them out all the want, but the police won't enforce anything except business closings.   And I am not even sure the police are doing that, I think that is more code enforcement types threatening licenses.    You can't tell essential workers that they have to work all day with the public, but its too dangerous to have visitors.  They won't comply, and rightly so.</p>

        <p>Same here. I live in the fairly conservative heartland, a fairly liberal heartland state though, but in the more conservative rural half, yet a more gentrified liberal county near a semi-major city, and I thought my town was one of the more conservative working-class towns in this county, but most of the people I know are liberals who seem to think they're from some coastal metropolis like NYC or LA. Like some fucked up swamp onion with layers of red and blue. And I'm not saying all liberals are pro-lockdown, or all conservatives are anti-lockdown, I just can't help but notice that so-called liberals often have a more authoritarian/statist streak than conservatives. When I was in middle school, our teachers told us liberals = liberty and conservatives = sexism/racism/homophobia. Also told us Democrats care about poor people and Republicans only care about rich people.</p>

        <p>No offense OP, but I think most people that post on a reddit entertainment sub have pretty boring lives. They would love to get universal income and sit home watching movies all day forever.  That doesn't really represent the wider population though. Most people do have lives they want to live outside of their homes.</p>

        <p>In the age of being obsessed about "privilege", I haven't seen anyone bring up how privileged people who are salaried in a job that isn't likely to go down are lately. In their position, it's just indoors vacation, and it even makes them economically stronger in the short term as their income isn't depleted while their peers' is. Too many of them aren't feeling the hurt first-hand and are far too quick to judge anyone who's losing their entire livelihood</p>

        <p>That particular comment is on your profile, but not on the sub. Other comments of yours are either completely visible or completely gone. Huh.</p>
<p>Yeah, I had that same thought! Preppers are often lumped in with "conspiracy theorist" types who see well enough through the propaganda. Then again, there is that other type of prepper just itching to whore themselves out to the authorities in the hopes of keeping their precious government afloat, even if that means a dystopian police state. I guess we know which kind of prepper frequents Reddit. That, or this clusterfuck really is the scam of the decade.</p>

        <p>As someone who did great on tests and won academic awards, but failed a quarter of her classes and almost didn't graduate because she didn't do groupwork or homework: the school system sucks. They don't really want us to learn practical math, science, literacy, or history. They want us to learn conformity and obedience, so teaching us a "sense of scale" is counterproductive. Even the best of teachers in the best of schools struggle to keep active intelligent students engaged, and those who succeed in school are often remarkably lazy or stupid, because that is precisely what is taught. I can't count the number of times I failed a group assignment because my group answered wrong and I answered right. The teachers acknowledged that my answers were correct, but they "had" to mark it wrong because they care more about teaching "teamwork" than actual science or history.</p>

        <p>I've considered it, but I don't think I could teach in the current education system. Everyone I know tells me I should be a doctor, teacher, or scientist, but the system is too fucked for me to have any interest in participating. Until a sociocultural shift that allows or requires more self-determination regarding health, research, and education, I'm satisfied enough as a housewife and homesteader. Though you don't necessarily need to be a teacher to teach, we can all learn something from each other.</p>

        <p>My husband's mother has been nagging him to quit his relatively new job as a temp worker in a laid-back candy warehouse - a job he more-or-less enjoys and that pays alright by our dirt-poor standards - to work somewhere like Amazon or Walmart. Amazon and Walmart are toxic corporate hellholes. Of course she also keeps nagging us to apply for the stimulus check, and according to her browser history, tried applying for a business loan. She doesn't own a business.</p>

        <p>Yeah, because it's such a privilege to go work in one of Jeff Bezos' sweatshops. Why don't they go work at the Amazon warehouse? Oh, that's right...because they are oblivious to their own privilege that allows them to sit at home collecting their full paycheck while their internet, electricity, and all the other amenities of modern life stay on. Plus, they can get food, products, and services delivered to their door...without understanding anything about the complex supply chains and societal infrastructure and millions of workers who make that possible.</p>

        <p>I think so too, part of me thinks the lock downs (in the United States) are one massive diabolical plot to get Joe Biden elected (and maybe he bows out so that VP Hillary Clinton gets her "rightful" place) at all costs.  The Democrats have chased out everyone that is remotely progressive and corrupt those who are foolish enough to stay in their party.</p>

        <p>When this whole thing started I felt very over worked. I was ecstatic to have the time off. I understand where people are, even if they're not scared of Covid they dont want to work. And a lot of people are looking forward to getting more of that time. What a conundrum. So I think you have a conflation of people who are scared of Covid, and people who are just fucking tired of working</p>

        <p>I'd expect the people who say they wouldn't mind a long shutdown have a job and/or money.  Nobody wants to live 6 months with no paycheck, unless they're already stinking rich.</p>

        <p>Key words: entertainment sub. Maybe I shouldn't judge, as I post fairly frequently in the Fallout subs, but most pro-lockdown folks' history consists of nothing but r/Coronavirus and very in-depth gaming/computing/TV content. Game mods, PC setups, which computer screen is better, what's on Hulu....Don't get me wrong, there's nothing inherently wrong with any of those things. Again, I play Fallout and post on those subs, plus I've been watching Punisher on Netflix because I only have so much housework/yardwork and I'm not gonna dirty up dishes just to wash them. But most people young or old who support the lockdowns and mask mandates pretty much live in their electronic devices. Either they have some cushy desk job working with computers or smartphones all day, or they don't work at all because they're retired, disabled, or lazy. A few might run marathons or volunteer at a hospital, but they exercise and socialize as a fun little hobby from a position of middle-class luxury. Not to actually make a living.</p>

        <p>The majority of posters I see on Twitter are asking for extended unemployment and more stimulus checks.  It's not about being scared of the virus, it's about wanting to stay home and get "free" money.  And I guarantee that most of those people calling for a lockdown will still go out and socialize.</p>

        <p>It's deeply disturbing how ignorant people are. Four months later and these morons 1. Still believe covid is horribly deadly and more like ebola in its danger and severity, rather than the flu. 2. Still think that lockdowns do something and are a normal and correct way to deal with a respiratory virus. 3. Still don't understand how the economy works, and why locking down for just 2-3 weeks is harmful to the economy, much less 6-8 months which would lead to complete collapse of the economy 4. Accept all of this dystopian shit as both normal and necessary and think it's a great thing. It's really disgusting how easily the majority of people are so easily programmed, that they will cheer on their own demise because someone made them believe its for their own good. Once again...this is nothing short of mass psychosis, and it's completely enraging, but also very depressing.</p>
