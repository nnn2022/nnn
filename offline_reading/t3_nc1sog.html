    <strong>Lockdowns are destroying my mental health</strong>
    <p><p>I am sorry to make a sad ass post here but I honestly don’t know where else to turn… I am in Canada where it seems like no end is in sight... I can’t work out, I live alone, I can’t see my friends, and it seems like the vast majority of people are just buying this, hook line and sinker. </p>
<p>Both of my dogs have been diagnosed with cancer, they are both dying before my eyes and my vet is currently closed due to covid exposure. </p>
<p>Working out daily was the only thing keeping me sane and not suicidal after losing my husband to murder five years ago, (the killer’s never been caught yet the police have no problem giving me a ticket after ticket when I go to the freedom protests every weekend, because fuck real crime right?) </p>
<p>There’s really no point to my post other than venting to the only other people that seem to get it and understand what’s truly going on… I’m just sad, losing hope, so lonely....please pray for us Canadians, I don’t know if it’s gonna get better....</p></p>

        <p>Canada sucks. </p>
<p>Awful weather, ridiculously high taxation for mediocre social services, overimmigration, terrible people, massive amounts of passive-aggressive, even sadistic bullying, endless competitive virtue-signalling, authoritarian political culture that's now shed its democratic facade. </p>
<p>And this is just the tip of the iceberg. </p>
<p>The pressure to conform is everywhere. There is almost no variation in the level of fascist totalitarianism from one end of the country to the next, unlike the US. Within the country, there is nowhere to run.</p>
<p>What you're seeing in your country is only the beginning. </p>
<p>But it's accelerating. The leaders are drunk with power. They think they are gods, especially Turdeau, who looks more and more crazed with every passing day.</p>
<p>This will get a lot worse.  </p>
<p>Good luck, you will need it.</p>

        <p>Fellow Canadian here. It's been hell on my family as well. My teenage daughter had mental health issues prior to any of this, and the senseless lockdowns made it even worse, to the point where she had to be hospitalized due to an overdose of sleeping pills/alcohol. She was doing so well before all this, too, getting better with the help of therapy, friends, and being able to do the things she loved in school. All of that went to shit with the lockdowns, and not a single god damned government representative on either side gives a shit about it. So-called "conservatives" don't oppose the leftist authoritarians at all. Most so-called "conservatives" and classical liberals bought into this shit show, and continue to double down on it. I despise the entire Canadian system, and frankly, most of my fellow Canadians at this point.  </p>
<p>All I can say is...try to stay strong. It's unfortunately all we're really able to do...<em>for now.</em>  </p>
<p>The time will eventually come when we'll be able to get it back, though. Just need to endure.</p>

<p>I can see why you despise most Canadians.</p>
<p>I remember explaining to a group of Canadians why the Covid-19 injections were dangerous. And they turned their noses up at me and said they weren't interested. </p>
<p>They were very arrogant about it.</p>
<p>I'm convinced Canadian indifference and complacency in the face of danger is an IQ thing. What do you expect from a population that needs to distinguish itself by identifying as "not American"?</p>
<p>There will be large-scale depopulation in Canada.</p>

        <p>Canadians in general are smug and sanctimonious, especially when it comes to Americans. It's rooted in an obvious and pathetic superiority complex. Canadians are arrogant narcissists without anything to actually back it up. They rely on the US to protect them, consume US products and media, and are for all intents and purposes, nearly identical to Americans in every way, only <em>less</em> diverse, which is especially ironic given their propensity towards spouting off drivel like "diversity is our strength".  </p>
<p>Not that I consider this to apply to <em>all</em> Canadians, mind you. But the odds are, if you come across a Canadian, they'll embody many, if not all of the aforementioned qualities, whether they're aware of it or not.</p>

        <p>I’m so, so sorry about your daughter. I often find myself saying I couldnt even imagine how hard this all is on teens and children...I sometimes ask myself if this is what the people in power want, is to all just be mentally destroyed if not committing suicide, drug overdoses ect. That thought gives me strength in the really dark moments I have, I don’t want to give any of these sick fucks the satisfaction. I’m including your daughter as well as you in my thoughts, heart and prayers. ❤️</p>

        <p>The inevitable balkanization of Canada (and North America as a whole) will put them in their place. It's not a matter of "if", but "when". Of course, it's more than likely quite a ways off (decades, at the least, perhaps even centuries), but even so. The pendulum swings.</p>

        <p>This made me tear up a bit, I’ve also been abandoned by my family, which is why my friendships are so important to me! Unfortunately this covid shit has reduced my friend group to a fraction of what it was, the ones I’ve lost are too busy virtue signalling and practising medical theatre, it’s like I don’t even know who they are.

        <p>I lost tons of friends over this, I had to close my social media, I gained 25lbs due to lack of physical activity and hatred of masks for gyms so I dont go, and have become undateable, a lot of my family thinks I'm crazy even if I know I'm right it hurts and sucks. I quit my job working at a hospital, and will be moving to a free state pretty soon, will essentially have to start a career and life over in my at 41. Ive become perpetually angry at the government, the news, all of healthcare, and most of my friends. The lack of socializing has turned me sour and angry. I used to be happy and relatively care free, I hate the person I see in a mirror. But I am not accepting tyranny and I will not live a lie. I can't. So, Trust me I know your pain.</p>

        <p>I’m so sorry. Also being in Canada, I know how hopeless you feel. This is a very isolating and sad time for many of us, especially for those of us who don’t buy into the bullshit. Yoga was my one healthy coping mechanism that actually worked to ease my depression and anxiety and it’s so hard having it taken away so I know how you feel being denied exercise. My dog also passed away a few weeks ago from cancer complications, so I know exactly how you feel. It may feel like it, but you’re not alone. I hope things get better for us soon. Hold on ❤️</p>

        <p>I’m so sorry for you doggo, I love him/her and just know they were the best doggo. It’s just hard af because my vet won’t even see me, answer phone calls or even give me results of tests I’ve spent thousands on all because someone in their office MAY have been exposed to someone with the rona. Absolutely infuriating how this shit trumps every other problem, but real problems. Thank you for the kind words ❤️</p>

        <p>Your strength and resilience is truly incredible. Your story is profoundly sad, yet you are still attending freedom rallies and trying to look after yourself through adversity.</p>
<p>You are obviously extremely strong but some distraction might be a good idea. Throwing yourself into something productive will be immeasurably better than watching the news, scrolling reddit or other social media. Art, music, it doesn't really matter. Something that you think you can fully immerse yourself into.</p>
<p>For me I was already questioning aspects of our reality coming out from a few years of conspiracy research. When covid hit I told my wife what would happen and she thought me crazy. Now here we are. Since then I have explored all kinds of subjects from synchomysticism to zero point energy and holographic reality.</p>
<p>The thing is, we can either let the material world affect us completely or we can detach slightly and view it from a third person perspective. This is not easy to do but it is possible.</p>
<p>I also found that collecting a few like minded Internet friends to be really uplifting. I have four people who I have never met that I now converse with often through reddit directly. Just things to make you laugh or smile or cry.</p>

        <p>You’re 100% right, I already do not watch the news, learned that lesson last year. I was doing very well up until they closed the gyms, again, that was my distraction. But god forbid we take care of our physical health during a supposed “pandemic”, it really set me over the edge was my vet checking out entirely during something as real as cancer because of a possible covid exposure....not even an actual positive test or anything, though I think that’s bullshit too tbh. </p>
<p>Since writing this post the amount of support I’ve gotten has actually made me cry, I sound like a broken record but I’m so very grateful for this community. Others call us the “selfish grandma killers” for our views but with this one post I’ve been lucky enough to turn my mood around with the beautiful words everyone has written here and PM’d me. ❤️</p>

        <p>My advice is to connect with a handful of people you really click with. That way even the day to day mundanities can become something to laugh about. My story is nowhere near as harrowing but the connections that I have made during covid have completely changed this part of my life. I talk to my wife about the interactions, the ripples extend out, synchronicities occur and before you know it the media screen becomes a pathetic joke, the restrictions become inconveniences, the lies become blatant.</p>
<p>I run my own business. This week I went to a site to do a rather technical and detailed job working externally. The site manager was insisting on wearing a mask outdoors. He was not wearing one and put one on in front of me to make the request. I had already submitted my risk assessment which said that we do not wear masks because our equipment is too dangerous. There is no mandate to wear a mask externally in the UK. So after he got angry I walked away. I left, calmly and smiling.</p>
<p>A year ago that would have had me really rattled. Walking off a job is not something I really ever would do. But I left, no regrets, even as he started to get angry I felt a smile come over my face, I actually couldn't help it. I knew what was coming. This has changed me, for the better. I am now a better person.</p>

        <p>Hey fellow Canadian, it sucks here pretty hard right now, no doubt. However, I don't know where you live, but where I am I haven't changed my life at all. I don't wear masks and neither do most of the people around here. </p>
<p>Get out of the cities, move to the country and to a low pop density area. People are sane outside of the cities for the most part.</p>

        <p>Oh my goodness I am so sorry for everything you’ve been through! Be kind to yourself, the grieving alone is enough to challenge anyone in your position. Add to it all this ridiculous bullshit you’re going through in your country and I can’t think of anyone who wouldn’t be struggling right now.</p>
<p>Is there any way you can work out? Are you totally not allowed to go outside would you get a fine or something? I am in New York City and there was a period of time over the winter when it was just the most dark depressing time. I actually bought a little mini elliptical exercise thing and I started doing it in my apartment. I would put some good music on and just get on that thing and go. It helped a lot.</p>
<p>Are you meeting any nice people at the freedom protests? Is there any way maybe you could start cultivating a group of like-minded friends? I know you don’t feel like it’s ever going to get better but it will eventually. It’s only a matter of time. Think of all the millions of people in your country and even around the world. It kind of seems like we are out numbered but I don’t think we are at all. The powers that be are doing a very good job at silencing a lot of people and hiding reality. They are not going to be able to hide it for much longer. This is all going to fall apart eventually. </p>
<p>I’m giving you a virtual hug right now, you will come through this and life will be good again for you. I truly believe that better days are coming.</p>

        <p>Okay I came here to offer that reading books can really, really change your life dramatically and really fast, if working out is crucial for you please read LIVING WITH A SEAL by Jesse Itzler immediately. Get the kindle version, get a bootleg PDF, amazon overnight it, whatever. The book is really funny but it also revolutionized the way I workout. You don't need any gear. You can do it anywhere. Trust me man, stop going on the doom internet for a while, read really good books, do some gritty street workouts of just endless pushups and squats and just get after it man. This too shall pass. Think of how much stronger you'll be in the future for having gone through this.</p>

        <p>Hey there. Fellow Canadian here, living abroad in India. 27/F.  Sounds like you've been through the wringer. My heart goes out to you. </p>
<p>Im offering online yoga classes to help curb lockdown fever. Trying to make the best out of a shitty situation! If this interests you at all, message me and  we can set up a time to try a one-on-one class via a video call.</p>
<p>My repetoire is pretty vast, so if you are not into yoga, we could focus more on just establishing an at-home workout routine. I have been teaching dance, yoga, and fitness for 10 years. </p>
<p>If you could manage to make a small donation for the class, that be rad, but if not, I can manage a freebie for a new friend from r/nonewnormal. </p>
<p>Whatever you decide is fine by me.. best of luck to you!</p>

        <p>I’m so sorry to hear this. I’m Canadian too, and I know how it feels when you’re surrounded by people who don’t think. I know how frustrating it is, how lonely it can be to feel like the only person with a functioning brain. </p>
<p>I don’t know who you are, but I love you. We are strong, we are smart, and we will make it out of this shithole if we stand together. Stay strong, stranger. I believe in you. </p>
<p>Message me if you feel like you need to talk to someone, OP or anyone who reads this. I understand how it can feel.</p>
