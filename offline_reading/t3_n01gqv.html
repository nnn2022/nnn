    <strong>How many of you believe vaccines can be contagious?</strong>
    <p><p>A semi-common sentiment I've seen on this sub is not wanting to be around vaccinated people because the vaccine could be, in some way, "contagious".  </p>
<p>I've seen posts to the effect of "don't go to the gym because vaccinated people sweat on the equipment and you could get it" or even posts implying the vaccine somehow releases aerosols that can be transmissable to others. These posts seem to get upvoted quite highly and regularly; so I'm wondering, to what extent do you believe this is a serious risk?  </p>
<p>Do you think there is a chance of "catching" the vaccine from aerosols or bodily fluids of vaccinated individuals?</p></p>

        <p>I think the question is flawed.  </p>
<p>The mRNA vaccine is NOT a conventional vaccine.  </p>
<p>Now with traditional vaccines, shedding is a well recognised phenomena.  </p>
<p>The mRNA is something else entirely, there are several subs here, in particular for women suffering effects from mRNA vaccines, including worrying symptoms from being around others who have been vaccinated, including changed menstrual cycle.  </p>
<p>So in short vaccines can shed (be contagious) the first week or two after taking them... But there is also a clear difference in the type of vaccine between conventional and this new tech mRNA</p>

        <p>I think it's theoretically possible for something like this to happen with a new technology.  Interestingly at the start of covid it was theorized that covid itself was a form of contageous vaccine they were trying to make.  </p>
<p>I could see how the spike proteins might be able to escape one body to another if they don't stick in the cells that create them but instead go about acting like spike proteins in the body.  </p>
<p>I don't have enough evidence to say it is happening and it's not just a bit of hysteria from all the stress, but I do believe it's theoretically possible to create a contagious vaccine.  I don't think it would intentionally be done this time, but maybe as a weird side effect.</p>
<p>I'm not afraid to be around the vaccinated, but it would be poetic if they were actually a huge threat to me and yet treat me like garbage now.</p>

<p>The WHO estimates that 750m people have been infected by covid based on antibody test results. <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/covid-19-world-in-for-a-hell-of-a-ride-in-coming-months-dr-mike-ryan-says-1.4370626">https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/covid-19-world-in-for-a-hell-of-a-ride-in-coming-months-dr-mike-ryan-says-1.4370626</a></p>
<p>When the estimates came out, approximately 1m people had died from covid.</p>
<p>That would put the infection fatality rate (IFR) at 1/750 = 0.0013</p>

<p>Interesting. I'm convinced you got something wrong, though:  </p>
<p>The estimated age-specific IFR is very low for children and younger adults (e.g., 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at age 25) but increases progressively to 0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85.  </p>

<p>What's your degree in? Not doubting you personally, individually, it just seems like everyone is a scientist or a doctor when you argue with them online. Reddit is 90% scientists.</p>

        <p>\&rt;I'm convinced you got something wrong, though:</p>
<p>Wait, it was the WHO, I just linked the article. What are you convinced that the WHO got wrong? </p>
<p>Your study doesn't mention seroprevalence rates once except to say, it took them from other articles. When you see the IFR for Italy, though, it shows close to 3. </p>
<p>Now, when the study was written, Italy had around 35,000 deaths. That would mean the study suggests a seroprevalence of 35,000/0.03 = 1.7m Italians at this point. </p>
<p>A lung screening trial from September 2019 in Italy on 1000 people was later found to have 116 people to have had covid by this date. </p>
<p>So, just curious, the author is suggesting that only 1.7m (less than 3% of the population) Italians had it as of September 2020 despite 11.6% having already been shown to have it the year before?</p>
<p>As for masks, studies have shown they only stop the largest droplets, which dominate 9 inches from your face. So, I guess you are right, if you plan on spending a lot of time in public 9 inches from people's faces, then you should wear a mask.</p>

        <p>&rt; Wait, it was the WHO, I just linked the article. What are you convinced that the WHO got wrong?</p>
<p>No, you extrapolated the IFR. The WHO provided the statistic of worldwide infections. There are a great many other factors, including timing. </p>
<p>You keep saying "your study" but I linked 5 studieh, each adding evidence to our large pool of evidence that masks are effective.</p>

        <p>Do you have a different figure for the number of deaths at the time of the WHO's estimate?</p>
<p>Death's that include gunshot victims and mostly 80 year olds, labelled covid death? Please, use the 750m figure of infections, and add your number on top of it for the time.</p>
<p>\&rt;You keep saying "your study"</p>
<p>I'm only addressing your study on the IFR. The other studies were nonsense. 2 talking about masks mandated states pre-June 2020, one commentary discussed as being scientificky, one of nonsense and TBH, I don't think I bothered clicking the 5th after the nonsense you'd sent me looking at.</p>
<p>So, "your study" has Italy seroprevalence at 2.8%, but we need to derive that, since they won't actually say the number they used. Isn't that very transparent and sciency of them to not disclose the base data they used?</p>

        <p>Tell the coroners who were told to call them covid victims it was a lie, you little bitch.</p>

<p>\&rt;The Grand County coroner is calling attention to the way the state health department is classifying some deaths. The coroner, Brenda Bock, says two of their five deaths related to COVID-19 were people who died of gunshot wounds.</p>
<p>\&rt;Bock says because they tested positive for COVID-19 within the past 30 days, they were classified as “deaths among cases.”  </p>
<p>You dumb fuck, you think you know better than the coroner who is objecting?</p>

<p>29 June 2020</p>
<p>\&rt;The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG and/or IgM) was 11.0%</p>
<p>So, I'm just curious, there are 20 scientists authoring this paper saying 11% seroprevalence months before the paper you linked gave 2.7%. Why are these 20 scientists wrong?</p>
<p>You forgot to provide a number of covid victims when you were trying to call me, and this coroner, a liar, you chicken shit.</p>

<p>It's bizarre how you all use the same stories and articles over and over again to support your "points". I think it's because you get this misinformation from these conspiracy forums and social media groups, and you circulate the same articles amongst each other. The Bock story is NOT about what you're arguing--gunshot victims being ruled as caused by COVID. No--there's a distinction between "deaths caused by covid" and "deaths with covid". Bock is talking about how the gunshot victims who test positive are counted as deaths WITH covid--not caused by.  </p>
<p>This is all explained in your own article.</p>

        <p>So, now you have refused to give of number of deaths, but object to the widely accepted one.</p>
<p>You call CBS local Denver new and the coroner conspiracy sources.</p>
<p>You directly contradict the actual officials who have stated on public record multiple times how covid deaths are counted.</p>
<p>Your source uses an IFR where the hide the seroprevalence level and it needs to be derived and then discovered to be a minor fraction of the one clinically tested for months earlier. </p>

<p>No--it is a fine news organization that is being <strong>misinterpreted</strong> by you.  </p>
<p>I already explained that misinterpretation, and to be honest, I don't think it's a matter that can even be disputed, if you are understanding what I'm saying. It's pretty black and white--you are trying to twist the article to say gunshot victims are being counted as deaths caused by covid. They are only being listed as deaths WITH covid--which is 100%, inarguably, factually true. It's not the same as saying it was CAUSED by covid.  </p>
<p>&rt; You directly contradict the actual officials who have stated on public record multiple times how covid deaths are counted  </p>
<p>Actually, I think that's you, as I've shown you the CDC guidelines for certifying covid deaths and you have disregarded that. I am sorry to say this, but you seem to be taking the strategy of plugging your ears and saying "lalala not listening!" when you hear things that contradict your worldview. Some "scientist'</p>

        <p>Sadly, my aptitude on the subject is only at a level of questioning the possibility. 
Even the best theoretical physicists struggle to explain quantum entanglement. 
They can prove it over and over and over again with the math, but translating it into something the layman can comprehend, isn't something they've managed to succeed in, as yet. </p>
<p>They've also barely scratched the surface when applying those possibilities to the medicinal world. - Quantum computing being the main benefactor to the discoveries/research thus far.</p>

        <p>Not concerned about aerosols. Ingestion / injection of body fluids from someone vaccinated might or might not be a problem, we won't know until more data comes in.</p>

        <p>Saying the vaccine can shed is fake news because it confuses it with the concept Geert talks about. The vaccine can cause vaccinated people to shed covid and create a super mutant... sure. </p>
<p>Even if the shot is making non vaccinated sick I would really really really stay away from the word shedding. Just leads to confusion. That being said I wish there was a better way to explain this theory.</p>

        <p>Been thinking a lot about this today after that report came out of the school in Florida not allowing vaccinated teachers. </p>
<p>I don’t know the science of it, but I wouldn’t put it past these monsters to design it that way. The women/period cycle thing sure is interesting.</p>

        <p>No. My friends and grandma are all vaxed and I’ve been around them plenty of times since. I’m fine, and thankfully they are too. I don’t believe you can suffer side effects from something unless you take it yourself. It doesn’t make any sense otherwise</p>
