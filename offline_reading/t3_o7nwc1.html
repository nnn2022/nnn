        <p>Assuming the CDC didn't just flat out make up its numbers, they probably only asked 1.2% of hospitals in the country to report the vaccination status of their COVID patients and deaths.</p>
<p>Then, after about 67% of those hospital's patients were vaccinated and 33% were unvaccinated, (similar to the ratio of vaccinated to unvaccinated adults in the country), they reported that only 0.8% of COVID patients and deaths in the country were known to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>Most ridiculously deceptive statistic of all time.</p>

        <p>So, the CDC changed the definition of covid for people who took the vaccine.</p>
<p>1st: they reduced the PCR cycle to 28; but still loads of people were showing positive.</p>
<p>2nd: they based on symptoms, not PCR any more; but still loads of people were showing positive.</p>
<p>3rd: they based it on hospitalizations due to covid.</p>
<p>All the headline tells you is: faking numbers is really easy.</p>

        <p>This headline kind of surprises me. Shouldn't that that death rate be 100% or 99.9999%? The fact that 150 vaccinated people didn't just come down with Covid, but died of it, is kind of surprising. I'm really curious what the demographic breakdown is off the recently deceased, both vaccinated and unvaccinated.</p>

        <p>They don't know.  In the article that I posted yesterday based on this same information, they openly claimed that they don't have numbers on how many vaccinated people are dying.....</p>
<p>So they looked at only unvaccinated people and out of those people it was only unvaccinated people who died.  Makes perfect sense if you don't think about it.</p>

        <p>"Fully vaccinated" is key here.  </p>
<p>Most of those who die from the vaccine are being said to have "died of COVID" or dead from comorbidities.  Most of these complications begin before the two week window after the second dose, so they can be called "not fully vaccinated."</p>
<p>It seems that sensitivity to the spike protein is the primary driver of COVID illness.  The vaccine fills the body with this spike protein, so people who are unable to tolerate it to the point of death, also die after the vaccine (but again, the deaths are from comorbidities or "COVID" and not the vaccine.)</p>
