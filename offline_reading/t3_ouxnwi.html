    <strong>I'm back after a 3 day suspension from reddit . Here are some interesting thoughts , please read .</strong>
    <p><p>So throughout American history there have been many people who have complained that Healthcare cost are just way too much.  There have been people dying from diabetes,  high blood pressure , cancer , etc because people cannot afford their maintenance medication but all of a sudden we can distribute tax payer funded vaccines to the whole country,  I'm sorry what?</p>
<p>They have been preaching for years that we cannot afford free Healthcare for people who pay taxes because it would raise the cost of everyone's taxes to an absurd amount , hell I was one of those people who said the same thing when told that social Healthcare is best . Damn do I feel lied to as should all of you . How is it that this bullshit vaccine which doesn't even work is free but insulin for little kids is not , blood pressure medication is not , checkups are not , dental work is not . You'd figure as a tax payer all these necessary things would be paid for by tax payer dollars .</p>
<p>This whole scamdemic has shown me that our government here in the United States is full of shit and I'm starting to see that we are the big bad villains on a global scale . We have more people in this country who die from starvation and unfortunate circumstance than we do of this BS covid . I'm convinced that everything we see is one giant lie .</p>
<p>This isn't capitalism failing,  this isn't some late stage capitalism this is simply what happens when the government stops working for WE the people and starts working for those who bought the government officials . Big pharma and all these corporations , walmart, Amazon,  homedepot , Lowes,  etc, who killed small business are to be blamed. </p>
<p>When are we gonna start waking up and take back our country and our freedoms.  Look around you the government and the media are turning us against each other . This is how they take your freedoms away. </p>
<p>It honestly saddens me watching my friends,  countrymen, turn on each other . My family escaped Poland when it was under socialist rule but sadly the same thing is happening here in America.  We have generations of kids being forced into poverty with lies of good jobs after educations that cost thousands of dollars . Where else in the world can an 18 year old get a 100k loan that must be paid back to go to school with no credit. </p>
<p>This whole country is a fucking scam, we live in a culture of censorship and lies.  I'm really worried about what's gonna happen in the untied states over the next 10 years . It's scary how fast things are getting bad .</p>
<p>Also this post isn't meant to alarm anyone , my wife and I are pretty happy individuals I was just having some insite while driving today . Life's a trip .</p></p>

        <p>I am a type 1 diabetic and buried in the business section a couple weeks ago was that Lilly bought a company trying to develop “smart insulin”. Long story short, this is a practical cure for type 1 diabetes. You give an injection of smart insulin, and it only engages when your blood sugar rises. The potential market will be in the billions. </p>
<p>People on the type 1 subs are like: can you imagine what Lilly is going to charge for this cure, and you will be on it for the rest of your life. Most people will not be able to afford it. </p>
<p>I am enraged and infuriated that the US burned trillions of dollars on the sniffles when they could have fucking cured diseases like type 1 diabetes or MS or childhood cancers with that money.</p>

        <p>I feel your frustration all the well . Think about the money we burn on bombing other countries . Think about the money we waste on corporate bailouts,  bank bailouts,  politician pensions , etc . All that wasted money is literally OUR money . They take money from my check,  your check , your neighbors check and waste it on selfish means instead of using it for WE the people. </p>
<p>We should have zero homeless unless it's a personal choice,  we should have zero hungry citizens,  and there should be zero bailouts . This is literally our money and it's being wasted . </p>
<p>We as a nation need to get together as law abiding peaceful citizens and take control back of our government.  Everyone needs to be taught history that isn't sanitized.  Enough is enough.  I hope within my lifetime I watch citizens in our country take back our political offices with pride.  I wanna see capitalism work again without the poison of a corrupt government sucking off corporations at the expense of the people .</p>
<p>I'm sick , not from covid but by the endless lies , gaslighting and corruption.  I'm a republican but I hope our Democrat brothers and sisters can wake up like many of us on the other side and join together to make and stand against tyranny .</p>

        <p>I'd recommend a work visa.  Work here for a few months and live in Mexico.  You get more for your money south of the border .</p>
