    <strong>Sick of ‚ÄòLong Covid‚Äô being used as an emotional manipulation tactic</strong>
    <p><p>I‚Äôve just seen someone on Twitter called Riley Behrens (can‚Äôt link his tweet for some reason) discussing how COVID gave him a Transient Ischemic Attack - a mini-stroke - and how he may never play sports again. And of course, he got it from someone who went to a wedding. His whole thread is his browbeating the reader into going along with all of this. </p>
<p>‚ÄòLong Covid‚Äô is just post-viral syndrome rebranded, and I kind of wish communities like ours would debunk it more, since it‚Äôs such a prevalent argument. Hell, the flu has been linked to all sorts of after-effects, including literal diabetes, and we don‚Äôt shut down the world over it. Well, we didn‚Äôt, at least. </p>
<p>Also, I ask that nobody harass Riley. He‚Äôs been through enough.</p></p>

        <p>"Long Covid" is a term for a grab bag of common symptoms, occurring at an unknown rate, that in other years would be labeled an autoimmune disorder, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, anxiety or depression, or not considered clinically significant.</p>
<p>This year, when people have something hard to classify go wrong with them, they blame COVID and the media eats it up as an easy way to panic people who have no statistically meaningful risk of dying of COVID.</p>

        <p>Absolutly, its disingenuous to call it long covid because it really implies that this is a new occurance specific to Covid 19 ... its not it happens with most viruses. They genuinely do this to scare us into believing that this is more serious than it is...  but if they didn't more people would realise this is a crock of sh*t and not follow the rules</p>

        <p>Long Covid is unsupported horseshit based on a handful of individuals with immune system disorders expressing Covid-like symptoms (identical to the cold) twice.  It‚Äôs just a bullshit excuse to try and kill small business forever.</p>
<p>Oh but a ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù (note: actually a mRNA injection being called a vaccine with no proper testing) will make you immune to repeat injections in a way your body won‚Äôt naturally because magic I mean science</p>

        <p>What gets me about is how clearly they don't actually care about people with post-viral syndrome or other overlapping/similar/related issues - mine is the failed spinal surgery kind. Even some with 'long covid' think it's special and expect to be treated accordingly, instead of realising they're in in it with the rest of us, who they didn't care about before this, and who no one ever treated as having a 'special' condition. I point out that people got these conditions before covid, and that many of said people just lost healthcare for nearly a whole year, as well as having struggles with the system before that. Then ask them what they think should be done about the condition, and how people with it should be included in society. After all, if there are going to be all these 'long covid' patients like they say, that should be important, right? But they don't seem to be very interested. They don't seem to know what the issues around such conditions are either. While obviously, no one wants to become disabled, from many of those who haven't had covid who bring 'long covid' up as a lockdown argument, I think there's an implicit disableism in how the assumption is become disabled, game over, and they don't think about how those who are live our lives.</p>

        <p>Yeah, but those people can't be saved because you can't force them to turn off the media.  No amount of interventions short of smashing all of their media devices will save them.  So the way I see it, all of these brand new hypochondriacs and mysophobics are on their own.  There's no legal way to help them because we can't compete with the media and the internet.</p>
<p>Thus, I have completely cut these doomers out of my life for good.  Family and friends both.  I have kept every rational person in my life and my life is better.  If I meet a doomer in the wild or at work, I simply walk away.  Fortunately, my boss is very rational and she has been from the very start.</p>

        <p>My best friend is a doomer - not an aggressive one, but she‚Äôs become incredibly scared. Outside, with masks off, she insists on staying a good three feet apart, and she scrubs down everything, despite the mountains of evidence that surface transmission is a nothingburger. I accommodate her, because she‚Äôs truly a wonderful person, and is one of the few who is genuinely motivated by (albeit, misguided) compassion, but it‚Äôs frustrating to witness, especially since she suffers from anxiety, and this is only exacerbating it.</p>

        <p>They say the virus does cause blood clotting, so strokes seem theoretically possible, but like everything, shouldnt be an issue in the young and healthy.  One interesting thing about the virus is its revealing how out of shape and unhealthy people in developed countries are.  At first I optimistically and foolishly thought thus would put a new focus on the importance of healthy lifestyles, but it doesnt seem to be doing that at all.</p>

        <p>It's rare and it is comparable to other rare risks in life.</p>
<p>Lockdowns are creating less healthy lifestyles. More people in Canada are exercising less or gaining more weight than before. Mental health is worse. The only good thing is that more people are taking their vitamins.</p>

        <p>I had what I suspect was ‚Äúlong covid‚Äù after getting a weird illness with the exact symptoms of covid in December after my roommate got back from China. It took both of us a while to get over it and I had a terrible cough and decreased lung function for months. Not fun, but shit happens and I smoke so that probably didn‚Äôt help. I just dealt with it like I do every other illness because I‚Äôm not a hypochondriac. Not in any way worth all this lockdown shit and now I‚Äôm fine.</p>

        <p>&rt; ‚ÄòLong Covid‚Äô is just post-viral syndrome rebranded </p>
<p>Hello, long covid sufferer here. Let me explain to you why do we use this term and what's the difference with other post-viral illnesses. Please, don't downvote for the sake of downvoting, I'm just sharing my experience and info. </p>
<p>Long covid it's a good definition for us because in this case, we know which virus triggered this condition, on the other hand, some chronic fatigue syndrom patients for example, don't know for sure which virus caused them their illness, but it would be helpful to re-name some syndromes as "Long HBV", as different virueses could require different treatments. </p>
<p>On the other hand, doctors are not exactly sure that our symptoms fit the exact pattern than post viral fatigue. For example, I've been suffering rashes, fatigue, dizziness, numbness, pins and needles, and I still have bouts of "viral" symptoms, like the cough and fever. In my case, it's been 8 months of symptoms coming and going. No problems prior to this virus, I am young, fit and healthy. </p>
<p>Luckily, some people actually has the NORMAL post viral fatigue after Covid and improves after a few weeks. The CDC has a few theories about this, there different "clusters" of long covid patients: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-care/late-sequelae.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-care/late-sequelae.html</a> </p>
<p>For example, some have organ damage, some don't have any visible problem but still have symptoms, and so on. </p>
<p>Let's underline something: <strong>long-covid is RARE.</strong> It affects something like 10% of the total of Covid infections. I'm not here to tell you that you may have this hell of a version of Covid, but to some people it happens and it wrecks your life 100%. </p>
<p>The problem here is that as there are many Covid infections, now we have a hell lot of new "post viral" patients and no treatment. </p>
<p>I miss my health so I'm just looking out for allies. I don't give a fuck about the media, we just need research and treatments.</p>

        <p>&rt;rashes, fatigue, dizziness, numbness, pins and needles, and I still have bouts of "viral" symptoms, like the cough and fever.</p>
<p>I have heard of all of that occurring with other viruses though, some like dizziness are very typical, as well as occurring in those who have a similar condition due to non-viral cause, as I do. If you want to specify the virus, then I think something like 'post covid fatigue' fits the nomenclature while not treating it as entirely unique. People with the 'normal' post viral fatigue don't necessarily get better in a few weeks, and it can shade into chronic fatigue syndrome. I'm very much sympathetic but think those with 'long covid' just didn't realise how bad, indeed debilitating, those conditions can be. Doctors won't all help there because neither did some of them: in fact I've come across an account of 'long covid' from a doctor who was having this belated realisation. Welcome to our world, I'm afraid.</p>

        <p>Influenza (and all of its many many variants) has caused long term effects all the time in a great many people over the last century and not once has anyone cared about any of them.</p>
<p>As a long covid sufferer, I would love to hear your take on this - please- why hasn't anyone ever given any compassion to anyone who has suffered long term or even died of any of the long term effects of influenza, H1N1, Avian Flu, etc...?</p>
<p>Why is it only Covid sufferers who are getting the compassion?   Children die every year from the flu.  Don't we need treatments for them ahead of Covid?</p>

<p>The medical community should be ashamed of themselves because they have been ignoring all the post-viral syndromes for DECADES. I've been reading testimonies of people who had H1N1 10 years ago for example and now have CFS/ME, it's terrible. </p>
<p>Actually, as there was no research about those conditions is that now doctors don't have a clue about how to treat long covid. I will forever support chronic illnesses from now on, I just didn't know that it was a thing, the media only cares about long covid because it fits its agenda, but chronic illnesses after a virus are not a new thing. I hope now we actually find funds and have research done to help us.</p>

        <p>My personal theory is that some populations may have larger long covid numbers because of a number of reasons that we don't know yet, let's say, genetics, pollution, bad diets and so on. What puzzles me is that in the support groups you can see easily that most of us used to exercise A LOT, so I also guess that there's a connection between people who used to exercise or worked as professional sport's players and long covid. I was hiking 12 hours in a row prior to this. </p>
<p>The truth is that there's only 1 almost-serious research about long covid (the one from the Zoe App) and they suggest that the number may be 10% and then it improves after month 3, but also people usually gets tired of reporting the App after month 3/4 so we don't know for sure. But yes, thank god, it's a rare thing.</p>

        <p>Post viral fatigue syndrome syndrome has always varied in severity and length for different people. Sure, you may know which virus caused it, but it still falls under that name. My dad had it after glandular fever and it took him ten months to recover. At the time he was young and healthy. I'm very glad you acknowledge it's rare, and must agree with you that more research has to be done. But rare or not I do know it's real, and hope you'll recover!</p>

        <p>Why isn‚Äôt anybody scared of the long term effects of a year of stress and fear and not going outside? It‚Äôs mind boggling.</p>
<p>I have depression. I have friends who know this. I have friends who know it has ruined my life.</p>
<p>Why are they fucking scared of a viral syndrome but not of ending up like me?</p>
<p>I‚Äôm convinced people don‚Äôt really honestly believe in mental illness.</p>
