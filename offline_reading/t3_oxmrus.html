    <strong>I don‚Äôt know one person who has died from covid</strong>
    <p><p>And I don‚Äôt know one person who has had to be hospitalized or had anything serious with covid</p>
<p>I do know:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A woman that received the J&amp;J vaccine.  She developed mysterious lumps on her face.  Not small but large as well as a huge lump on her neck.  She also suffered facial paralysis.  All the side effects subsided but she tested positive for covid 2 weeks after they went away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A woman that died mysteriously after receiving A vaccine.  She was healthy and was very pro vaccine.  She wouldn‚Äôt leave her house without a mask.  She died a week after her 2nd injection.  It‚Äôs being said her death wasn‚Äôt related.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Today I was notified of that a family friend had developed cancer in her lady parts.   No idea wether her vaccine had anything  to do with it but she had extremely abnormal cycles after her injections and she ended up having to have everything removed due to the Newly found cancer.  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There‚Äôs not enough info to draw conclusion in my opinion but it‚Äôs worth taking a look at.</p></p>

        <p>I only know one person who had to go to the hospital to get some extra oxygen, thankfully he's okay now. Everyone else has had flu like symptoms, or no symptoms (which made us question if it was a false positive). I also know that my dad had a TIA (mini-stroke) the day after his second vaccine, but the doctors dismissed it and said it was unrelated. Thankfully he's also okay now but TIAs are an indication that you may have a full on stroke so that's fun to constantly worry about.</p>

        <p>REALLY??? Well that settles it, I‚Äôm officially convinced that no one has died from covid and bill gates made it up for money. Obviously the hundreds of billions of dollars he already had wasn‚Äôt enough to quench his thirst for world domination! First he convinced everyone to carry around his products in our pockets and keep our personal info on them, then he used those products to spread his lies and convince everyone they need the vaccine!</p>

        <p>My father passed away 3 days after his first injection. He wasn't doing very well to begin with, nothing to do with covid btw but he was doing better making a good recovery. He was in a rehab center and the day before he was released they gave him the first shot,  he went home and passed away the following day.  I'm not saying it had anything to do with it but I don't rule it out either. The vax hasn't been around long enough to know the complications due to current health issues.</p>

        <p>I'm on similar counts. </p>
<p>One guy I know allegedly died of COVID when all of this started last year. However, upon reviewing his final messages again more recently, I am not convinced that COVID killed him. In his final days he was joking about how he had no symptoms and would rather have COVID every day of his life than asthma and the heart attacks he often had.</p>
<p>Two people I know (my friend's husband and a guy I had spent a considerable amount of time with as we shared the same circle of friends) were killed by AstraZeneca. It has been confirmed in both cases that it was the injection that killed them. </p>
<p>Pfizer also left one of my friends paralyzed for life and he died a couple of weeks after. His cause of death is still being investigated but, even if it turns out that the injection didn't kill him, the fact that he was left paralyzed by it is bad enough.</p>

        <p>I only have what their families have said to go on but my friend's husband died within minutes of being injected. I don't know any more details than that as I'm not going to grill my friend over the issue. However, she has said that the doctors confirmed that the injection did it. </p>
<p>I find it extremely unlikely that his wife would have lied about it as she was supporting the injections to the extreme prior to his death. She was desperate to have their daughter (who I believe is 5) injected and would have probably signed her up for clinical trials on children. Her husband's death woke her up and she realised just how much the government and media have been lying. </p>
<p>As for the other one, this one was all over the media in the UK and more than one 'expert' has said that the injection caused it.</p>

        <p>I had Covid in December of 2021.  Lasted about a week.  I am considered ‚Äúat risk‚Äù because I have allergies and have asthma flare ups once or twice a year when the weather is right. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs was nothing though.  I didn‚Äôt even take the vitamins that were recommended.  I wanted to see what would happen if I didn‚Äôt.  Call me stupid but I wanted to see this killer at full force</p>

        <p>It's not hyper-inflated. The issue with CoVid or SARS2 is that the fucking thing is ULTRA-UBER-SUPER-DUPER <strong>CHAOTIC!</strong></p>
<p>You can have no real pre-ex's like my mother and die from this virus if proper EARLY TREATMENT is not done and then you can be the worst sickest 99 year old on the PLANET... and this virus will pass you over and not sicken you at all.</p>
<p>We have treatment options for CoVid: HCQ+Zinc and Ivermectin. We knew those worked in April 2020... yet we keep on seeing it pooh-pooh'd every single time it is suggested.</p>
<p>You know why? Those contracts with Pfizer and the other pharmas that of all the motherfucking stupid things had a stipulation in them that Pfizer and the other pharmas could IXNAY TREATMENTS and disallow them from being used.</p>
<p>That... that rises to the level of a criminal conspiracy in my opinion. One that a whole lot of people including Fraudci should be sitting in prison over.</p>

        <p>They are terrorizing people into getting the shot. Fear is what they use. I believe many deaths attribute to covid either were of something else or they caused with their extreme treatments of the people. I honestly don‚Äôt believe anyone died of COVID, but by other illness or by the extreme treatments like breathing machines. People could be killed by giving them even prescribed drugs because there are so many adverse   reactions. People aren‚Äôt cows where they can inject anything and everything in them. The body has a threshold. That‚Äôs why I trust my own immune system and nothing else ever. I do not take any prescription or even over the counter drugs. They are mass murderers. Vaccines are supposed exist when their is no treatment, there are treatments.  That‚Äôs why they forbade the treatment so they can force vaccine on people.  </p>
<p>I‚Äôm sorry for you dear mothers passing. </p>
<p>Her death was unnecessary because of evil people.</p>

        <p>I know of one person that was hospitalised and that was my mum. She‚Äôs a nurse and she got it before the world went completely insane, back in February 2020. She was in hospital for a week, mostly because it made her asthma bad and she ended up with pneumonia, although her main symptom was being sick. She‚Äôs fully recovered now and does not want the vaxx, ever. Interestingly, all of her colleagues contracted it too, and the majority of them chose to have their vaxx in October/November last year. They all did blood test antibody tests around December, and she was the only one with antibodies.</p>

        <p>Just asked her and turns out they did antibodies tests this April, so 15 months after she had Covid, and she still had antibodies but didn‚Äôt have the vaccine and never wants it. Her colleagues had vaccines and didn‚Äôt have antibodies after ten weeks. I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôve tested since, she‚Äôs retired so I think she‚Äôs stopped giving a shit. They all tested positive at some point between February and May 2020.</p>

        <p>Bear in mind not having ‚Äòactive‚Äô antibodies doesn‚Äôt mean someone is no longer immune. When enough time has passed after the body has successfully fought off the virus, the antibodies wane and the person is left with long lasting t-cell immunity. </p>
<p>If the person is exposed again, usually those t-cells are activated and antibodies are once again produced. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs logical - otherwise your body would have to constantly have active antibodies for every infection you‚Äôve ever encountered.</p>

        <p>Let me clarify --by 'severe' meant having to take two weeks off from work, but not having to go to the hospital.</p>
<p>For me, it was similar to having a case of pneumonia.</p>

        <p>It's been a year and a half and I only know one person who has caught it. My nephew caught it from a kid at school who went to Italy. Anyway he was only slightly sick and the other 5 people in the household never got it. He has his own room but not a big house and although he is autistic he is quite the social butterfly when he chooses to be. Anyway everyone is fine</p>

        <p>I know of one person who died of Covid related illness, but she was over 80 years old and already had idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (a terrible lung disease). Considering how many people I know it's far less than 1%.</p>
<p>It's the same with medical professionals though. I know three people irl in the medical field and their views are very different from the medical professionals shown on mainstream media.</p>
<p>The first person I know is a doctor, he told me that he has had a few patients die of Covid but no more than average with the flu, and it's always been those who are severely overweight. </p>
<p>The second person I know is a dietitian. Not really qualified to talk about Covid you might say, but she works in a hospital and she told me that even during the times when Covid cases were at their peak in South Africa, the hospital (which is one of the biggest in Johannesburg btw) was never even close to being overfilled, in fact, it was more empty than usual because people with other sicknesses were scared to leave home because of Covid.</p>
<p>And the third person I know is a nurse and he actually worked in the Covid wing of a hospital in Pietermaritzburg which was supposed to treat Covid patients for the whole province, and he says this whole thing is completely ridiculous. He also said Covid wing was never even close to reaching full capacity and those who were admitted into hospital for Covid fell into two categories: those who had such mild symptoms they could've just recovered at home and then those who died no matter what treatment they were given.</p>
<p>Seems to me like if there was no global mass media, most people wouldn't even know that Covid was even worth worrying about at all.</p>

        <p>I know of one chap admitted to hospital with Sepsis and tested +ve, I believe they would have put covid on his death cert. A funeral director friend of mine was telling me about an old lady they had a funeral for too, admitted to an NHS ward with Pneumonia and they changed the ward to a covid ward and left her there. She was marked as a covid death. Everyone I know who's tested positive has got better within a week, except for one woman at work who was off for covid, long covid then magically came back pregnant üòÇ</p>

        <p>I know roughly 10 who have been hospitalized, 3 of them very recently with 1 still actively in the hospital. Out of that total group 2 have died, a husband and wife and both long standing members of our fire department, both within a month (if you‚Äôve never attended a firefighter funeral you won‚Äôt fully understand the magnitude of this).  On the same token, I can‚Äôt count the number of people I know that have had Covid with no issues and to date I don‚Äôt know anyone who has died (1 possibility but no proof or timeline) or had major issues with the vaccine.  Kinda leaves a person on the fence in some ways about it all.</p>

        <p>Me neither. I know some people who tested positive but it was basically a cold or flu.</p>
<p>I know one person who died of a heart attack right after the vax became available to healthcare workers (she was an older nurse). She had health problems so it might not be related to the vaccine but the timing was kinda :/</p>

        <p>I know 9 or 10 people who had Covid during 2020. None of them developed anything more than a common cold and they‚Äôre spread out all over the country. One of the families was who we were all worried about from the beginning. </p>
<p>The dad has bad asthma, mom has lupus and other issues and the son was born with a heart condition. All 3 got it and all ended up completely fine. This was during the early summer months of last year. I understand it‚Äôs completely anecdotal but it‚Äôs odd that not a single person I know has died from it. And I‚Äôm including friends of friends or extended family. And the majority of my family is in NY which got hit really hard.</p>

        <p>So fun that death soon after a vaccine is just a coincidence. But death after a positive COVID test is counted as a COVID death, no matter what the true cause (i.e. a car accident).</p>

        <p>My mom asked me this question. When I said no she said "yes you do" like it was a gotcha question. Apparently my cousin's grandpa, not related to me and whom I have never met, died from it. Also he was 70+ and already sick. Somehow because of this I should get vaxed. I don't understand the logic.</p>

        <p>I know a couple people hospitalized from covid. My Dad also should have been but just never went. I do know one person who died, but he was relatively old and unhealthy.</p>
<p>So yeah, it's touched my life a little but not a ton. It's not so pervasive.</p>
<p>However, I also don't know a single person who's had a bad vax experience. So it's really tough using this anecdotal evidence to support any side of the discussion. Just what I'm thinking.</p>

        <p>Me neither. 
I know one person that was hospitalized. He's 60 plus and very large bodied. </p>
<p>There has been about 9 people I personally have met that have had covid pre vaccine and 3 that had covid post vaccine. 
 One post vaccine is 80+ and she also had a stroke post vaccine. (Within a month I think).  She tested positive twice for covid post vaccine and never had symptoms.</p>

        <p>I actually know a ton of people who tested positive, and many of them had symptoms, some quite severe. I know of six that were hospitalized, and three who died.</p>
<p>Still not getting vaccinated.</p>
<p>Probably the one thing that gets me the angriest is that I 100% believe there are inexpensive effective treatments and prophylactics that are being withheld and from the beginning, any discussion of them was banned online, let alone any of them being widely used or recommended. So I view the deaths that truly did come  from the COVID infection as straight-up murder.</p>
<p>edited to add: of all the people I know who were vaccinated, only one admits to issues after (severe headaches for months). And one, who was already in rapidly declining health, had his health situation fall off a cliff within 24 hours of vaccination, and he passed about a month later.</p>

        <p>You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a tortoise. It's crawling toward you. You reach down and you flip the tortoise over on its back.</p>
<p>The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun, beating its legs trying to turn itself over but it can't. Not without your help. But you're not helping.Why is that?</p>
