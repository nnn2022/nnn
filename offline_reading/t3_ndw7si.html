<p>So they die after getting the vaccine.</p>
<p>But they've tested positive for covid-19.  So they are considered a covid death.</p>
<p>Either the vaccine didn't work, or the vaccine killed her.  But neither of those will show up in the stats.</p>

        <p>They do.  One would think that a media apparatus that cared about the truth would make the low death counts top story.</p>
<p>But they just go with the biggest number possible, to terrify and outrage as many people as possible.</p>

        <p>I know of two folks that died and were covid positive. One was a family member that was a severe alcoholic with liver failure. He had no cough or anything and we cared for him in our small home for 3 days before he was hospitalized and died. The hospital called to tell us he was covid positive. None of the five people living in our house at the time got sick and we didn't do anything special as far as masks or gloves. </p>
<p>Another friend's older and long time cancer patient spouse died in her sleep. Her heart just stopped. She was ravaged with cancer. He is still mad that they put covid as her cause of death.</p>
<p>I know no one that has had covid and been more than sick like they had a bad cold. </p>
<p>I know MANY that have had to miss days of work due to side effects from the vaccine though. </p>
<p>It's all so disturbing.</p>

        <p>See, I don't get why people are STILL subjecting themselves to the media to begin with. I just don't get it. By now we can clearly see how they distort reality for views and profit, they purposely report with an intense bias that they never declare beforehand having had and never apologize for later when called out for it, they purposely skew data, quotes, results, statistics, etc. And create their own "facts" that are either half truths or flat out lies. (And these lies can be bought and they are bought, and they're spread around like a contagious disease) All of these companies are in it together, afterall, if not for each other, how could they get so rich and stay so rich without having a pact with one another? How could they stay in power for so long and just grow like a cancer without anything or anyone powerful enough to stop them, not even each other? Every last one of these media outlets are being pulled by a string and in turn pull our strings and it's so blatant as to having admit to crimes in front of the masses without so much as a blink, a hesitation, a question, a flinch. Nothing. The propaganda is suffocating at this point, like a toxic gas in the air. But the masses don't mind, they simply put on their gas mask and carry on like the whole world isn't an inescapable controlled disaster of evil regimes, at least not in their eyes, because if they're patriotic somehow they're immune to elimination or suffering, they're immune to the fumes. And they're better than you for obeying...</p>
<p>And remember, they only see us as numbers, that's it. Not a human, not a soul... a profit or a loss, an identification number, just a number out of millions, and that won't change, not now, not any time soon.</p>

        <p>If they didn't speak up during the crisis, then they're useless now.</p>
<p>The people organically decided that now that we've got the vaccine, mask time is over, period.  The powers that be, seeing that their opportunity to maintain a firm grip was slipping, decided all of a sudden that 'CDC says that it's okay to take the masks off'.  There's nothing to the new ruling other than the powers that be trying to portray the people standing up to power and just part of their plan.</p>
<p>Now that this is over, it's time to enact CYA.exe; they're going to be clamping down hard on anyone who tries to critique how they handled the pandemic, even though they're the same people who critiqued Trump for over a year.  Any scientist that tries to posit that the Elites manipulated the world in order to try and seize totalitarian levels of control will just be cancelled as a 'qanon conspiracy theorist', and their fellow scientists will be employed to discredit them, while the media works to either not mention anything they say, or repeat ad nauseum about how much of a quack they are.</p>
<p>The Elites are in ascendance, and they'll do whatever it takes to ensure that nobody can blame them for anything.  This is why it's vital to ensure that 2022 and 2024 are massive wins for the other side, and that all the RINOs and Elite sympathizers like McConnell are removed from power like Cheney was, so that we can take back power; because if the Biden faction wins another term, you might as well just kiss the Republic goodbye.</p>

        <p>What about those who died after getting vaccinated, whether they were diagnosed with Covid or not? </p>
<p>What a huge load of bs. They're trying to spin this as if the vaccine protected them from dying of covid and they died of something else, well, why don't we start asking if the vaccine caused that something else (which was not covid) to kill them? Oh wait, because the vaccine companies are immune to liability and that has been officially declared wrongspeak and you will be banned from any and all platforms for applying even a modicum of your critical thinking skills when it comes to these covid vaccines.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This bs is criminal, but what else can you expect when you're dealing with big pharma, governments and companies like Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J, etc.?</p>

        <p>This is not confusing at all... not everyone who has covid and dies necessarily dies OF covid.   Even with the panic and chaos at the beginning of the pandemic when they were recording everyone who died who had covid they weren't actually saying everyone who died did so BECAUSE they had covid.    There were just too many deaths that they couldn't actually do autopsies for all of them at the time.   But every REASONABLE person knew that just because someone died while infected didn't mean they died from the infection.   I never actually heard a single person say that everyone who died defo died only because they had covid.    Many did but not all of them... this is not confusing at all and it never has been.</p>

        <p>Are you serious?  They keep repeating the number 600,000. And they are still recording anyone that dies within 30 (or in some states 60) days of a PCR positive as a COVID death. This isn't something just at the start of the pandemic that they did.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter what you hear from people around you. It matters what they are recording and the media repeats which are those numbers.</p>
<p>It's not that confusing you are right.  There should be consistency which there is not.</p>

        <p>I don't get my numbers from the news because the news is almost always complete trash designed to convince ignorant people of a particular narrative.   I get my numbers by reading the actual published reports and they are not saying 600,000... that's what the news is saying.    Numbers for people who died without pre existing conditions is lower and even those who died with pre existing conditions but did actually die of covid is lower.    The number you are talking about is the number of ALL the people who died who also had covid.    Those people did not all die OF covid though and the actual data doesn't say that they did.    It's not my fault that the news chooses the biggest and scariest number because it gets more views and is not my fault of you do not choose to do your own independent research and find the actual statically accurate analysis of those numbers.     A lot of people died because of covid,  not all of the people who died and had covid died because they were infected but many of those who died and also had preexisting conditions would not have died at all of they didn't have covid.  Cases like type 1 diabetic and organ transplant or medically fragile but not Ill or terminal patients also died because of covid but need to be recorded differently.    All this is available if you actually know how to read raw data correctly (and no I'm not talking about info graphics).    If you are getting your information from TV or internet news then you're going to be poorly informed most of the time.   Maybe you should demand more accurate reporting rather than blindly believing or complaining about what they say.   Accuracy use to matter in news, it no longer does because the people of walmart are happiest when the talking box in their living room tells them that the sky is falling or that someone is a big fat liar and the sky is not actually falling.    Either way almost everyone on either side of this stupid argument is wrong and wasting their energy fighting each other or congratulating themselves on being so much smarter than the other side when both sides are wrong about so much.    </p>
<p>The fact is that a scary thing happened for the past year... it sucked.   The governments around the world were all mostly unprepared and they made mistakes but it was never malicious.   They did what they were hoping at the time was right or the best choice and if they realized they were wrong about something they changed things.    Stuff changed in basically every country over the course of this past year and no one wanted to make people stay home, wear masks, avoid social interaction or anything else for kicks.   The situation was unprecedented and terrifying for many regular people... how unbelievably terrifying do you think it was for those leaders who knew that every wrong move could possibly cause actual humans to die?   Do you honestly believe that all of the leaders, medical personnel and scientists in the world just did all of this to fuck with us?  Sometimes they were right and made good calls, sometimes they were wrong and made mistakes... expecting anyone (even leaders and experts) to be 100% perfect in ultra high pressure decision making is insane.   Grow up.</p>

        <p>You're an adult that doesn't believe people and governments should tell the truth because all "reasonable people" didn't believe them anyway?</p>
<p>You're an adult that doesn't believe the government shouldn't be held responsible for their decisions and actions even if they absolutely devastate lives, businesses, the economy because its a hard job?</p>
<p>You're an adult and you excuse a government that ignored years of pandemic planning by scientists and bent to complete hysteria and shut down the world (never in that pandemic planning) and called it following the science?</p>
<p>I'm not sure how you got to be such a nihilistic adult where truth, rationality and responsibility mean nothing to you but I refuse to engage with a person like you.</p>

        <p>I didn't say they shouldn't be held responsible and I didn't say that mistake weren't made I also didn't say that anyone SHOULDN'T tell the truth.    What I SAID was that they DIDN'T tell the truth and that while mistakes were made they were not done in a malicious way (with the possible exception of vilified CDC and dissolving the pandemic prep dept that did exist until shortly before we needed it).   I honestly dislike the previous POTUS greatly and feel like he made huge mistakes throughout this entire thing but even with my incredibly strong feelings of mistrust and dislike I still made exceptions for some of his policy decisions in response to the pandemic because everyone was just guessing on what was best.    If I can get over my hate of that person and accept that he made mistakes then so can you.</p>
