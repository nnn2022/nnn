        <p>Masks have become so politicized that masks are now a "badge" IE: political compliance tool used to identify and identify non-supporters of a cause. The science has shown that masks do nothing for the intended purposes of covid so any denial of goods/services is simply political discrimination.</p>

        <p>..which side do you think politicised it. </p>
<p>The science says the opposite of what you just said. Stop politicising health care and then gaslighting. It’s appalling and your ‘morals’ are abhorrent.</p>

        <p>corona, no matter how severe or not severe, has been exploited by liberals for political purposes the last 2 years. and at this point that doesnt even matter to argue if its politicized or not, its too late to even question that lmao, cuz at this points its full blown politicized.</p>

<p>You're telling me that a 0.7% decrease shows that masks are working and that we should mandate masks, whilst not mandating healthy eating and exercise to stop the 78% of obese people who end up in the ER? In what universe does that make sense? If 0.7% is something that's 'effective' then why not spend your energy mandating people to lose weight, eat healthy and exercise?</p>

 .7% decrease in the transmission  is considered statistically significant to the scientists doing the research but ask a follower of jesus and that's a just necessary sacrifice for you to continue being entitled.</p>

        <p>I showed the associated risk reduction: 0.7%. How about being serious and dealing with the 78% of the people who end up in hospital: the obese? What about these scientists? When will you advocate for their research, or is simply easier to virtue signal about caring for people's health whilst doing nothing to eat healthy, lose weight and exercise? It's been a year!

        <p>My preprogrammed response would actually be to point out how your patronizing arrogant sense of self righteous judgement over others is blasphemous because only He can judge. Hence the hypocrite comment t</p>
<p>Other than that, of course obesity is a serious issue that should be addressed. It's also been around a lot longer than covid so it's weird you're hyper fixated on it now instead of a pandemic we're trying to stop from becoming an endemic. Again, hence the hyporcritc comment. </p>
<p>Lastly, if all life is so precious to you, it's odd how willing you are to dismiss that statistically significant reduction is transmission. (See previous hypocrite comment)</p>
<p>And for reiteration, It's once again odd that you're judging people allegedly made in Gods image as if you have some divine prowess over His will and intent. Do go off though.</p>

        <p>An individual that doesn't eat right or exercise only hurts themselves. An individual the chooses not to wear a mask can potentially harm others. Your tangent about diet and exercise is irrelevant to the discussion of mask efficacy. </p>
<p>And yes, A drop in the rate of change of growth of 1% in less than three weeks is statistically significant. This isn't a 1% decrease in daily new cases, but the rate of change of daily new cases. If you're familiar with differential calculus, this refers to the second derivative of cumulative cases. That's significant for any exponential process. </p>
<p>You have a right to be lazy and eat garbage because it doesn't affect others. Trying to equate that with potentially spreading diesese to others is asinine.</p>

        <p>&rt;An individual that doesn't eat right or exercise only hurts themselves.</p>
<p>if you're more likely to need hospitalization because you can't stop eating and being a lazy fuck, then you DO hurt others because you're going to be taking up space in the hospital because you'd rather eat than be healthy. therefor a healthy person who has an underlying condition through not fault of their own would be out of luck since all the lazy fatties have all the hospital space.</p>

        <p>Apparently you weren't CC'd in the peer-reviewed articles that made it clear that the overweight and obese are not only the ones endangering everyone by being 78% of the hospitalised patients (ie, their life choices are literally killing grannies with cancer, etc) but they are also viral super shedders. Again, if you want to make a huge change, the state should MANDATE that the overweight and obese lose all that weight... after all, it's been a year! Who can't lose wight after a year of state mandated healthy eating and exercise?</p>

        <p>It’s funny to me that you clearly didn’t read your own sources. </p>
<p>So let’s break down how disingenuous and intellectually dishonest you’re being: </p>
<p>1) this article is about <em>personal protection</em> which no one is claiming masks do. They protect <em>others</em></p>
<p>2) this article says the same. </p>
<p>3) this article is once again about protection for the wearer, which no body is claiming. </p>
<p>4) says the same thing, but is also about makeshift masks, not medical ones. </p>
<p>5) this article talks about makeshift masks vs cloth masks, and says there needs to be more research. </p>
<p>6) again this is about protection for the wearer. </p>
<p>7) this article has clearly been updated and backtracks a lot of its initial claims. It is now claiming that there is a lack of research (not true) but still recommends wearing masks when out of the home as a precaution. </p>
<p>8) this article is about protection for the wearer. </p>
<p>9) is about non medical masks. </p>
<p>So not only did you attempt to cherry pick articles you thought supported your <em>pre determined point of view</em>, you couldn’t even get that right and just posted a bunch of articles uncritically, without even reading them, while misrepresentations what they say with carefully cherry picked, out of context quotes. </p>
<p>This is misinformation and you are guilty of using academic studies you <em>clearly</em> don’t understand, in order to spread your anti intellectualism. Your smugness in doing so is abhorrent. You are a morally repugnant person for spreading such dangerous myths and attempting to justify it by deliberately misinterpreting what the science is saying. For shame.</p>

        <p>UhOhhh, there’s a throwaway account on the case. Lol.</p>
<p>You’ve refuted nothing. </p>
<p>The studies speak for themselves.</p>
<p>Your shitty summaries of the studies, and weird attempts at shaming me for sharing them, don’t negate the findings of the studies.</p>
<p>Here’s some more mask truth for you; </p>
<p>https://twitter.com/yinonw/status/1321177359601393664?s=21</p>
<p>Also;</p>
<p>“The WHO admitted to the BBC that its June 2020 mask policy update was due not to new evidence but “political lobbying”: “We had been told by various sources WHO committee reviewing the evidence had not backed masks but they recommended them due to political lobbying. This point was put to WHO who did not deny.” (D. Cohen, BBC Medical Corresponent).</p>
<p>To date, the only randomized controlled trial (RCT) on face masks against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community setting found no statistically significant benefit (see above). However, three major journals refused to publish this study, delaying its publication by several months.</p>
<p>An analysis by the US CDC found that 85% of people infected with the new coronavirus reported wearing a mask “always” (70.6%) or “often” (14.4%). Compared to the control group of uninfected people, always wearing a mask did not reduce the risk of infection.</p>
<p>Researchers from the University of Minnesota found that the infectious dose of SARS-CoV-2 is just 300 virions (virus particles), whereas a single minute of normal speaking may generate more than 750,000 virions, making cloth face masks unlikely to prevent an infection.</p>
<p>Japan, despite its widespread use of face masks, experienced its most recent influenza epidemic with more than 5 million people falling ill just one year ago, in January and February 2019. However, unlike SARS-CoV-2, the influenza virus is easily transmitted by children, too.</p>
<p>German researchers found that even an N95/FFP2 mask mandate had no influence on the coronavirus infection rate. </p>
<p>Austrian researchers found that the introduction, retraction and re-introduction of a facemask mandate in Austria had no influence on the infection rate.</p>
<p><strong><em>*In the US state of Kansas, the 90 counties without mask mandates had lower coronavirus infection rates than the 15 counties with mask mandates. To hide this fact, the Kansas health department tried to manipulate the official statistics and data presentation</em></strong>* (LOL)</p>
<p>Contrary to common belief, studies in hospitals found that the wearing of a medical mask by surgeons during operations didn’t reduce post-operative bacterial wound infections in patients.</p>
<p>During the notorious 1918 influenza pandemic, the use of cloth face masks among the general population was widespread and in some places mandatory, but they made no difference.</p>
<p>Asian countries with low covid infection rates, most of them neighboring China, benefited not from face masks but mainly from early border closures. This is confirmed by Scandinavian countries Norway, Finland and Denmark, which didn’t introduce mask mandates but closed borders early and saw very low covid infection and death rates, too.</p>
<p>German scientists found that in and on N95 (FFP2) masks, the novel coronavirus remains infectious for several days, much longer than on most other materials, thus significantly increasing the risk of infection by touching or reusing such masks.”</p>
<p>Just admit that masks do nothing.</p>

You’re so stubborn, you’ve pre-formed your opinion and it is so deeply ingrained, you’re ignoring evidence that doesn’t fit your narrative. </p>
<p>I am shaming you because what you are doing is causing real world harm. You don’t realise it, but it’s true. You should be ashamed, but you’re not. </p>

<li>
<p>"It should be concluded from these and similar studies that the filter material of face masks does not retain or filter out viruses." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Yet there is no convincing scientific data that supports the effectiveness of masks for respiratory protection" </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Masks will always fit fairly loosely with considerable gaps along the cheeks, around the bridge of the nose and along the bottom edge of the mask below the chin." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Focusing on universal masking alone may, paradoxically, lead to more transmission of Covid-19 if it diverts attention from implementing more fundamental infection-control measures." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"cloth masks should not be recommended for HCWs, particularly in high-risk situations, and guidelines need to be updated."' </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"There have been extensive randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies, and meta-analysis reviews of RCT studies, which all show that masks and respirators do not work to prevent respiratory influenza-like illnesses, or respiratory illnesses believed to be transmitted by droplets and aerosol particles." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"N95-masked health-care workers (HCW) were significantly more likely to experience headaches. Face mask use in HCW was not demonstrated to provide benefit in terms of cold symptoms or getting colds." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"None of the studies reviewed showed a benefit from wearing a mask, in either HCW or community members in households (H)." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"A total of six RCTs involving 9,171 participants were included. There were no statistically significant differences in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza, laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections, laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, and influenza-like illness using N95 respirators and surgical masks." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"In light of the medical research, therefore, it is difficult to understand why public-health authorities are not consistently adamant about this established scientific result, since the distributed psychological, economic, and environmental harm from a broad recommendation to wear masks is significant, not to mention the unknown potential harm from concentration and distribution of pathogens on and from used masks. In this case, public authorities would be turning the precautionary principle on its head" </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"By making mask-wearing recommendations and policies for the general public, or by expressly condoning the practice, governments have both ignored the scientific evidence and done the opposite of following the precautionary principle." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"So, at the end of the day, the only thing that provides personal protection for the person wearing the mask is a respirator. And that is the thing that healthcare workers should be wearing" </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"My biggest problem with telling people they can wear masks is it gives you this false sense of security. And it might even encourage you to think that now you’re protected and you’re protecting people around you." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"just want them to understand that they aren’t very much more protective than if they weren’t wearing them. And they’re really not doing a whole lot of good for the people around them." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"the wide use of masks by healthy people in the community setting is not supported by current evidence and carries uncertainties and critical risks.” </p>

        <p>Politically motivated and funded research is not in any way the same as objective scientific research. Most seem to recognize that politics are playing a role in the covid pandemic and reactions to it, yet they choose to deny that the science has been changed to fit political agendas. However, there are clear instances of this happening, whether the changes are for profit or to save one’s career is what we cannot know. Believing these overnight 180s in scientific outcomes,  decades of science just tossed out and censored,, and ignoring the role politics play, is akin to biologists saying Creationism is suddenly proven over evolution, right after mass Young Earth Creationist funding, and people just accepting it as true!  </p>
<p>The best example is the New  England Journal of Medicine, one of the most reputable sources. In July 2020 the authors made this statement: </p>
<p>&rt;"We understand that some people are citing our Perspective article (published on April 1 at NEJM.org) as support for discrediting widespread masking. <strong>In truth, the intent of our article was to push for more masking, not less.</strong>"  </p>
<p>But what were the actual findings regarding masks OUTSIDE a health care facility in this study?  </p>
<p>&rt;"We know that <strong>wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection</strong> from infection... The <strong>chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal.</strong> In many cases, the <strong>desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic</strong>... Focusing on universal <strong>masking alone may, paradoxically, lead to more transmission of Covid-19 if it diverts attention from implementing more fundamental infection-control measures</strong>... It is also clear that <strong>masks serve symbolic roles.</strong> Masks are not only tools, <strong>they are also talismans that may help increase health care workers’ perceived sense of safety, well-being, and trust in their hospitals</strong>. Although <strong>such reactions may not be strictly logical</strong>, we are all subject to fear and anxiety, especially during times of crisis. One might argue that <strong>fear and anxiety are better countered with data and education than with a marginally beneficial mask, particularly in light of the worldwide mask shortage, but it is difficult to get clinicians to hear this message in the heat of the current crisis....."</strong> </p>
<p>Does this sound like a push for masking outside of health care facilities? Or even really in them aside from their symbolism? This is nothing but a blatant contradiction of their findings to save their careers in our cancel culture.  </p>
<p>Another example of this horror is an article on why facemasks don't work by John Hardie, BDS, MSc, PhD, FRCDC. He concluded:  </p>
<p>&rt;"Literature reviews have confirmed that <strong>wearing a mask during surgery has no impact whatsoever on wound infection rates during clean surgery... No matter how well a mask conforms to the shape of a person’s face, it is not designed to create an air tight seal around the face... a study of eight brands of face masks found that they did not filter out 20-100% of particles</strong> ... etc."  </p>
<p>Yet if you don't have an archived link, here is what you now see:  </p>
<p>&rt;"If you are looking for “Why Face Masks Don’t Work: A Revealing Review” by John Hardie, BDS, MSc, PhD, FRCDC, <strong>it has been removed. The content was published in 2016 and is no longer relevant in our current climate.</strong>"  </p>
<p>Our "current climate" is one that prefers fear over fact, control over science and reason, submission over freedom</p>

        <p>you can think having it off for 10 seconds wont affect anything I've been on plenty of flights since this shit and they leave it off for 15 minutes average. even if someone has it off for 10 seconds its already not effective everyone will take their mask off as some point to eat or drink.  show me these stats proving taking a mask off for 10 seconds doesn't spread something since if a mask works how you claim you need it on at all times compromising that in a sardine can will clearly infect everyone. what a dogshit argument you have and then claiming im claiming to something for justification lmao</p>

        <p>The same people that claim to be righteous and empathetic show their true colors in this comment section. By the way, there are 1800 users online compared to 53000 readers (NNN is likely being brigaded). </p>
<p>In their delusional world, everybody, old and young, sick or healthy, has to follow the same rules. Where is the logic in that? One-size-fits-all is not empathetic at all. Let's say the state govt created rules that for physical fitness testing, every high schooler has to prove they can run a mile. Empathy would be realizing the poor kid in crutches with a sprained ankle cannot run the mile like everybody else. Evil delusion would be making him do it anyway because the state's "rules are rules."</p>
<p>To all the brigading sheep: Loving to follow the rules does not mean you are full of love. The way you react to dissenters shows that you are full of the opposite, actually. If being a "good person" entails getting frustrated at those that disagree, then no thank you. Those fruits can be recognized from a mile away.</p>

<p>The rules have a reason.  Willful ignorance, or low IQ or whatever causes people to refuse to wear the masks is not disagreeing, it is endangering people's lives and aiding in the destruction of the economy.</p>

There’s also 0 laws that state a business can’t request, if not require, someone to wear a mask, especially if they have other accommodations, like a drive through or curbside pick up.</p>

        <p>You're still twisting the words around to victimise the person, who has to say "no". That's it, no force involved. </p>
<p>Also, why are you trying to paint me like a person who would "force" someone to answer the question? My character has nothing to do with how HIPAA ACTUALLY works. </p>
<p>Lets not even get started about how if a private business denies service because you aren't wearing a mask, it has nothing to do with weather or not they want your medical information, and all about how they reserve the right to deny service for any reason(within the bounds of discrimination law). </p>
<p>Just because you cant walk into a CVS, Fry's etc. without a mask, doesn't mean you're being discriminated against. It means they have interest in the health of the public. YOU can be accommodated in other ways, like, curbside pickup, or online orders. You still have access, just not inside the store, so you are not a victim. FUCK OFF.</p>

        <p>Ah yes, you've even stumbled on proof that this is all bullshit and ignore it! </p>
<p>In July 2020 the authors made this statement: </p>
<p>&rt;"We understand that some people are citing our Perspective article (published on April 1 at NEJM.org) as support for discrediting widespread masking. <strong>In truth, the intent of our article was to push for more masking, not less.</strong>"  </p>
<p>But what were the actual findings regarding masks OUTSIDE a health care facility in this study?  </p>
<p>&rt;"We know that <strong>wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection</strong> from infection... The <strong>chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal.</strong> In many cases, the <strong>desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic</strong>... Focusing on universal <strong>masking alone may, paradoxically, lead to more transmission of Covid-19 if it diverts attention from implementing more fundamental infection-control measures</strong>... It is also clear that <strong>masks serve symbolic roles.</strong> Masks are not only tools, <strong>they are also talismans that may help increase health care workers’ perceived sense of safety, well-being, and trust in their hospitals</strong>. Although <strong>such reactions may not be strictly logical</strong>, we are all subject to fear and anxiety, especially during times of crisis. One might argue that <strong>fear and anxiety are better countered with data and education than with a marginally beneficial mask, particularly in light of the worldwide mask shortage, but it is difficult to get clinicians to hear this message in the heat of the current crisis....."</strong> </p>
<p>Does this sound like a push for masking outside of health care facilities? Or even really in them aside from their symbolism? This is nothing but a blatant contradiction of their findings to save their careers in our cancel culture.  </p>
<p>Another example of this horror is an article on why facemasks don't work by John Hardie, BDS, MSc, PhD, FRCDC. He concluded:  </p>
<p>&rt;"Literature reviews have confirmed that <strong>wearing a mask during surgery has no impact whatsoever on wound infection rates during clean surgery... No matter how well a mask conforms to the shape of a person’s face, it is not designed to create an air tight seal around the face... a study of eight brands of face masks found that they did not filter out 20-100% of particles</strong> ... etc."  </p>
<p>Yet if you don't have an archived link, here is what you now see:  </p>
<p>&rt;"If you are looking for “Why Face Masks Don’t Work: A Revealing Review” by John Hardie, BDS, MSc, PhD, FRCDC, <strong>it has been removed. The content was published in 2016 and is no longer relevant in our current climate.</strong>"  </p>
<p>Our "current climate" is one that prefers fear over fact, control over science and reason, submission over freedom</p>

        <p>Just put on a fucking mask and shut up. They’re a fucking business they can have any policy’s they want. That’s their policy. I have no problem being skeptical about the whole thing but wearing a mask is not the same as getting the vaccine. If they were telling her she needed the vaccine I’d probably be on her side but they aren’t. I work 8 hours a day with a mask on yet somehow I haven’t suffocated yet.</p>

        <p>The recommended time is up to 4 hours, not every 20 minutes, and yes, I believe it. Why? My profession requires to go to operating rooms and lo and behold, everybody wears a mask and they wore it before it was common. I experienced the flu epidemics every winter and people who didn't take a vaccine had to wear a mask in the hallways where they might come across patients. Why wouldn't the surgery teams not wear a mask or just wear it until the patient is unconscious?for a show? People worry about their own mouth germs in masks but don't worry about germs coming in their open bellies during surgery? Whats your angle?</p>

        <p>You realize surgical masks are about body fluids such as blood, and not infection spread right? Hell there's no connection between masks and post surgical infection rates. And actually yes, they are very much for show, in fact mostly. According to the New England Journal of Medicine:</p>
<p>&rt;It is also clear that <strong>masks serve symbolic roles.</strong> Masks are not only tools, <strong>they are also talismans that may help increase health care workers’ perceived sense of safety, well-being, and trust in their hospitals</strong>. Although <strong>such reactions may not be strictly logical</strong>, we are all subject to fear and anxiety, especially during times of crisis.</p>

        <p>The only papers I find about infections during surgeries is for closed surgeries, I am talking about open, as for example heart surgery. Interestingly enough the use of a  surgical mask when coughing on blood agar gels indicates a significant reduction of bacterial particles falling on the surface. 
It is not the New England Journal who said that, NEJM is a journal, you meant the authors, who wrote a letter 3 months letter to the Journal. You might be interested in this quote:
"the intent of our article was to push for more masking, not less. It is apparent that many people with SARS-CoV-2 infection are asymptomatic or presymptomatic yet highly contagious and that these people account for a substantial fraction of all transmissions.Universal masking helps to prevent such people from spreading virus-laden secretions, whether they recognize that they are infected or not."

        <p>Idiot. As if we werent already 65% water. Worst that can happen is that your skin gets pruny. You literally said,”do you not understand the dangers of having a damp cloth over your face” as if the mask covers your entire face. What you implied is that the amount of moisture coming out of your own mouth is going to harm us or worse drown us. We should all be dead if you think like that. Moisture is everywhere.
What are some risks of breathing in our own moisture
(Edit) i looked it up and yea its a problem but that means we have to produce immense amounts of moisture for us to start dying. Also doctors use them daily for surgery and those surgical rooms are filled with sweat and saliva and blood</p>

<p><strong>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</strong> became law in 1990. The ADA is a civil rights law that prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in all areas of public life, including jobs, schools, transportation, and all public and private places that are open to the general public. The purpose of the law is to make sure that people with disabilities have the same rights and opportunities as everyone else. The ADA gives civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities similar to those provided to individuals on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin, age, and religion. It guarantees equal opportunity for individuals with disabilities in public accommodations, employment, transportation, state and local government services, and telecommunications. The ADA is divided into five titles (or sections) that relate to different areas of public life.</p>

        <p>Can I please see the studies showing that wearing shoes and shirts increases the spread of infection, creates new infections through moisture retention, causes people to neglect other basic hygiene, destroys the environment, lead to higher child suicides, etc? Here are some for masks: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"We know that <strong>wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection</strong> from infection... The <strong>chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal.</strong> In many cases, the <strong>desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic</strong>... Focusing on universal <strong>masking alone may, paradoxically, lead to more transmission of Covid-19 if it diverts attention from implementing more fundamental infection-control measures</strong>... It is also clear that <strong>masks serve symbolic roles.</strong> Masks are not only tools, <strong>they are also talismans that may help increase health care workers’ perceived sense of safety, well-being, and trust in their hospitals</strong>. Although <strong>such reactions may not be strictly logical</strong>, we are all subject to fear and anxiety, especially during times of crisis. One might argue that <strong>fear and anxiety are better countered with data and education than with a marginally beneficial mask, particularly in light of the worldwide mask shortage, but it is difficult to get clinicians to hear this message in the heat of the current crisis....."</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"It should be concluded from these and similar studies that the filter material of face masks does not retain or filter out viruses." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Yet there is no convincing scientific data that supports the effectiveness of masks for respiratory protection" </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Masks will always fit fairly loosely with considerable gaps along the cheeks, around the bridge of the nose and along the bottom edge of the mask below the chin." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Focusing on universal masking alone may, paradoxically, lead to more transmission of Covid-19 if it diverts attention from implementing more fundamental infection-control measures." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"cloth masks should not be recommended for HCWs, particularly in high-risk situations, and guidelines need to be updated."' </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"There have been extensive randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies, and meta-analysis reviews of RCT studies, which all show that masks and respirators do not work to prevent respiratory influenza-like illnesses, or respiratory illnesses believed to be transmitted by droplets and aerosol particles." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"N95-masked health-care workers (HCW) were significantly more likely to experience headaches. Face mask use in HCW was not demonstrated to provide benefit in terms of cold symptoms or getting colds." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"None of the studies reviewed showed a benefit from wearing a mask, in either HCW or community members in households (H)." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"A total of six RCTs involving 9,171 participants were included. There were no statistically significant differences in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza, laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections, laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, and influenza-like illness using N95 respirators and surgical masks." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"In light of the medical research, therefore, it is difficult to understand why public-health authorities are not consistently adamant about this established scientific result, since the distributed psychological, economic, and environmental harm from a broad recommendation to wear masks is significant, not to mention the unknown potential harm from concentration and distribution of pathogens on and from used masks. In this case, public authorities would be turning the precautionary principle on its head" </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"By making mask-wearing recommendations and policies for the general public, or by expressly condoning the practice, governments have both ignored the scientific evidence and done the opposite of following the precautionary principle." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"So, at the end of the day, the only thing that provides personal protection for the person wearing the mask is a respirator. And that is the thing that healthcare workers should be wearing" </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"My biggest problem with telling people they can wear masks is it gives you this false sense of security. And it might even encourage you to think that now you’re protected and you’re protecting people around you." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"just want them to understand that they aren’t very much more protective than if they weren’t wearing them. And they’re really not doing a whole lot of good for the people around them." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"the wide use of masks by healthy people in the community setting is not supported by current evidence and carries uncertainties and critical risks.” </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the person involved [in experimentation] should have legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, over-reaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"before the acceptance of an affirmative decision by the experimental subject there should be made known to him the nature, duration, and purpose of the experiment; the method and means by which it is to be conducted; all inconveniences and hazards reasonably to be expected; and the effects upon his health or person which may possibly come from his participation in the experiment.”  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Proper preparations should be made and adequate facilities provided to protect the experimental subject against even remote possibilities of injury, disability, or death.” </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Delorme’s hospital went from seeing roughly 20 suicide attempts per month involving patients 15 or younger, the AP reports, to more than double that—and, disturbingly, more determination than ever before in the attempts.”  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“In the meantime, lockdowns and other restrictions have harshly curtailed social interaction and, tragically, catalyzing the aforementioned youth mental health crisis. Here in the US, the Centers for Disease Control reported that 25 percent of young adults considered suicide during the lockdowns, while overall mental health and suicide rates appear to have spiked as well.”  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Coming from both the left and right, and around the world, we have devoted our careers to protecting people. Current lockdown policies are producing devastating effects on short and long-term public health. The results (to name a few) include lower childhood vaccination rates, worsening cardiovascular disease outcomes, fewer cancer screenings and deteriorating mental health – leading to greater excess mortality in years to come, with the working class and younger members of society carrying the heaviest burden.”  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Those who are not vulnerable should immediately be allowed to resume life as normal. Simple hygiene measures, such as hand washing and staying home when sick should be practiced by everyone to reduce the herd immunity threshold. Schools and universities should be open for in-person teaching. Extracurricular activities, such as sports, should be resumed. Young low-risk adults should work normally, rather than from home. Restaurants and other businesses should open. Arts, music, sport and other cultural activities should resume."  </p>

        <p>So you actually believe it's fine to throw out decades of rigorous and not politically motivated science out in favor of rushed and biased conclusions? You really think most people can just afford to have their whole lives cancelled for speaking out against an authorian movement? Cmon.</p>

        <p>You are literally asking this because you know that very specific criteria for study hasn't been conducted, as a means to discredit our point of view, whilst simultaneously ignoring the numerous scientific studies and fact put before you. </p>
<p>Please provide me a study in the last 3 months that shows that eating 4 oreos in an hour won't kill me. If you can't show me, I'll take it as proof that eating 4 oreos in an hour will in fact kill me. That's what you're doing here.</p>

        <p>Wear a mask or get out. What is so unclear about this?</p>
<p>You have a right to not wear a mask. A business owner has a right to refuse service to you for not wearing one.</p>
<p>What is so complicated to understand here that after a year of this, some people STILL don’t get it?</p>

        <p>That's why all these businesses that are refusing anti-mask bullshit offer curbside pick-up or delivery.</p>
<p>They accommodate customers who can't, or won't, obey their store policies.</p>
