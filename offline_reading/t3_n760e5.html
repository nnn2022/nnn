        <p>A summary of the SARS-CoV vaccine evaluations in animal models (including  the current report) that indicated an evaluation for immuno-pathology after challenge is presented in Table 2. </p>
<p>As noted all vaccines containing  S protein induced protection against infection while the studies with VEE and vacci ia vector containing the N protein gene only did not. </p>
<p>Also shown is that aTh2-type immunopathology was seen after challenge of all vaccinated animals when evaluation for immunopathology was reported except the study in hamsters with a GSK whole virus vaccine. Thus, inactivated whole virus vaccines whether inactivated with formalin or beta propiolactone and whether given with our without alum adjuvant exhibited a Th2-type immunopathologic in lungs after challenge. </p>
<p>As indicated, two reports attributed the immunopathology to presence of the N protein in the vaccine;however, we found the same immunopathologic reaction in animals given S protein vaccine only, although it appeared to  be of lesser intensity. Thus, a Th2-type immunopathologic reaction  on challenge of vaccinated animals has occurred in three of four animal models (not in hamsters) including two different in-bred mouse strains with four different types of SARS-CoV vaccines with and without alum adjuvant. </p>
<p>An inactivated vaccine preparation that does not induce this  result in mice, ferrets and nonhuman primates has not been reported.This  combined experience provides concern for trials with SARS-CoV vaccines in humans. </p>
<p>Clinical trials with SARS coronavirus vaccines have been  conducted and reported to induce antibody responses and to be ‘‘safe’’  [29,30]. However, the evidence for safety is for a short period of observation. The concern arising from the present report is for an  immunopatho-logic reaction occurring among vaccinated individuals on  exposure to infectious SARS-CoV, the basis for developing a vaccine for SARS. </p>
<p>Additional safety concerns relate to effectiveness and  safety against antigenic variants of SARS-CoV and for safety of vaccinated  persons exposed to other coronaviruses, particularly those of the type 2  group. Our study with a VLP SARS vaccine contained the N protein of  mouse hepatitis virus and Bolles, et al.,reported the immunopathology in  mice occurs for heterologousGp2b CoV vaccines after challenge [25].  This concern emanates from the proposal that the N protein may be the  dominant antigen provoking the immunopathologic reaction. Because of well documented severity of the respiratory disease among infants given an inactivated RSV vaccine and subsequently infected with RSV that is considered to be attributable to a Th2-type immunopathologic reaction and a large number of studies inthe Balb/c mouse model that have  described and elucidated many components of the immunopathologic reaction to RSV vaccines,the similarity to the SARS-CoV vaccine evaluations in Balb/cmice supports caution for clinical vaccine trials with SARS-CoV vaccines in humans. Of interest are the similar occurrences  inC57BL/6 mice and in ferrets and nonhuman primates that provide  alternative models for elucidating vaccine-induced mechanisms for  occurrences of Th2 immunopathologic  reactions after infection. </p>
<p>As indicated, strong animal model evidence indicates expression of the N  protein by SARS-CoV vector vaccines can induce sensitization leading to a  Th2–type immuno-pathology with infection. In contrast to our results,  those studies did not find clear evidence of the Th2 type immunopathology  on challenge of mice given a vector vaccine for the S protein.  The finding of a Th-2-type pathology in our studies in animals immunized  with an rDNA-produced S protein is unequivocal. </p>
<p>In this regard, animal  model studies with FIPV in cats and RSV in mice have indicated that viral  surface proteins may be the sensitizing protein of inactivated vaccines  for immunopathology with infection [32,45]. This suggests that  presentation of the S protein in a vector format may direct immune  responses in a different way so that sensitization does not  occur.</p>
<p>Limitations of the present studies include their performance  in mice only and uncertainty of the relevance of rodent models to SARS-CoV  vaccines in humans. Additionally, a more intense study for virus  replication including quantitative RT-PCR assays might have confirmed the  probability that virus replication is required for induction of the  immunopathology after vaccination.</p>
<p>Evaluations of mechanisms for the  immunopathology, including immunoglobulin and cytokine responses to  vaccines and tests for antigen-antibody complexes in tissues exhibiting  the reaction,could have strengthened the Th2-type immunopathology  finding.</p>
<p>Finally, a successful study with a Th1-type adjuvant that did  not exhibit the Th2 pathology after challenge would have confirmed aTh2  bias to immune responses as well as provide a potential safe vaccination  approach for SARS.</p>

        <p>I'm surprised more people haven't dropped dead from these vaccines tbh. Sure they get serious side effects, but just about most get over them okay. I'm curious about fertility of women a few months from now, and perhaps other unknown effects.</p>

        <p>I mean if I am just a conspiracy nut, fine. Just tell me how you solved this issue and I'll be happy to see that these scientists were clever and fixed this issue quickly. But I haven't seen anyone even bring it up. Why not?</p>

        <p>I saw someone ask on this virologist website this very question, he's a guy who calls everyone anti-vaxxers and is so pro-vacc. He didn't have an answer. When parts of a story are missing or people don't answer basic questions...'we fixed this by......changing this or by doing that" that's a problem for me.</p>
