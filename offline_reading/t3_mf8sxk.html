        <p>I will just copy a comment I wrote a few days ago here... to my knowledge it is not graphene. Not at all. There are serious efforts underway right now on social media plattforms to cause confusion about these fibers, the whole ethylene oxide thing was a coordinated effort to poison the information well. The thing with EO was that it is easily debunkable; so everyone who looked into this will then think "oh so the fibers are probably just dust if they got it wrong with the EO they must be stupid". For more information browse my comment history. My comment:</p>
<p>Ive  been researching these fibers since 2018. I found them in  antidepressants, caffeine pills, cheap red meat, make-up and skin care  products. I also found them in air and rain samples. The fibers on the  swabs and masks display a disturbing behaviour, they search for warmth  and they wiggle around. There are different versions of these fibers,  there are very long ones who look like spider webs, but they really are  not. I compared a spider web with one of these fibers and they are not  the same.</p>
<p>I found fibers in sputum  samples that emptied themselves. Instead of black they became  see-through, and whatever was in these, was floating around in the  sputum. There are microorganisms in these things. There is a researcher  from the US who researched the long version of the fibers for atleast 20  years. His name is Clifford Carnicom, he is also an ex government  employee. You might check out his PDF research library, this dude has  even isolated the microorganism in question and isolated his DNA. <a href="https://www.carnicominstitute.org/">https://www.carnicominstitute.org/</a></p>

        <p>I am extremely skeptical of the idea that these things are microorganisms. These fibers "wiggle around" because they get electrified and magnetized. I think it's some kind of material which is not exactly safe to breath in.</p>

        <p>I understand your scepticism, I forgot to mention that the fibers themselves are not alive or something. They are not a life form. The stuff that is on the inside is alive. I have pictures of empty fibers that were breathed in by a family member (not from the masks; it came from the air actually in 2018). And in that sample there were non-empty fibers too. So I zoomed into the sputum with a microscope and found that whatever came out of the fibers was microorganisms. I couldnt see them but they coagulated into small blobs and there was residue in the fibers themselves.</p>
<p>The fibers from the masks and swabs look very similar to the fibers I found in 2018, but the 2021 ones have this special heat-seeking and deforming property that I didnt see before.</p>
<p>I am very sure about this because my research had the same results as Clifford Carnicoms research, I basically confirmed what he found for myself.</p>

        <p>These microorganisms definitely have properties of funghi, to be precise it is the filamentous growth that is similar to funghi. But it also shares some properties with bacteria. I know there is peer-reviewed research out there that says oh it is just some variant of lyme disease, but I have a feeling that it is meant to misdirect people who look into this. Also the internet was plastered with information that "Morgellons is just a psychological illness". It is absolutely not, you can take samples of sufferers and analyze them and what do you get: the same fiber structure that was found in 1) air samples 2) products and 3) sputum samples. Our bodies are inundated with this stuff and there is real proof for this. My opinion is that these fibers have been put there on purpose, and the containing microorganisms are engineered to do *something* in the body.</p>
<p>The history of the fibers goes back to 1998 when the first samples (it fell down from the sky) were sent to Clifford Carnicom, who immediately kickstarted his research. After some time the first reports about the smaller fibers that are contained in products came out, together with all the reports about people who have fibers growing out of their body</p>

        <p>SEW YOURSELF A SIMPLE SINGLE LAYER FACE MASK. or go maskless if you have the balls lol</p>
<p>i reuse the elastics from the single use masks and sew them into my masks, i found they are the best elastics for masks</p>
