        <p>Everyone I know is all over Facebook and Instagram posting about how happy they are with the election results and I'm sitting here like...I'm a mom and a woman of color and I'm not happy at all. I have an overwhelming feeling of dread at these election results. And it makes me feel crazy for feeling this way. Coming to this sub makes me feel a little better.</p>

        <p>Yep. All my friends are getting off to “healing our country” and how Biden has dogs and Kamala made history blah blah blah. God I can’t wait for them to get what’s coming to them and for them to suffer from Biden’s policies. I will treat them with the same disdain they treated Trump and his supporters.</p>

<p>They're truly stupid enough to believe that they've just been liberated from literally Bad Mustache Man. I should know. Everyone, literally EVERYONE in my household outside of myself was part of the crowd you mentioned.</p>
<p>Of course, something tells me they're about to experience the same sort of "liberation" as the Baltic nations, the Romanians, Bulgarians, Hungarians, Czechs, Slovaks and so on. I'd be fine with leaving them to enjoy it, but the new abnormal is mandatory.</p>

        <p>Same. I feel like there’s so much blind optimism going around, where people are constantly talking about how the world is going to change for the better and everything is going to heal. It’s the same style of ignorant thinking that caused so many people to be pro-lockdown in the first place.</p>

        <p>Very true. So much ignorance and blind optimism. </p>
<p>People going on about how they can finally tell their kids “everything will be ok” and “character matters.” What on earth are these people talking about? Everyone is so delusional but I almost sometimes feel like I’m the delusional one for not going along.</p>

        <p>This is how I feel. I’m also not American, but Canadian so it still very much affects us up here.</p>
<p>I pointed out to my mom (who despises Trump and loves Biden) the hypocrisy of people not wearing masks/social distancing at the election party last night and she just left me on read.</p>
<p>I don’t like Trump but also don’t feel “relieved” like apparently the whole world does, and I almost feel guilty for feeling that way.</p>
<p>Seeing everyone posting about it and memes about Trump getting the boot is just driving me crazy.</p>

        <p>I’ve decided the better adjusted you were- the more mentally stable- the more you resist this paradigm. </p>
<p>When my anxiety was bad I would’ve latched onto this too. It replaces all your pressure to interact, find a discussion topic, etc. you can mold your entire
Existence around it.</p>
<p>What is <strong>alarming</strong> about that is how many people apparently have these issues. You never think a majority of those around you are so fragile. I wasn’t the minority then, I’m the minority now that I’m confident and proud of myself.</p>
<p>What a nightmare.</p>

        <p>This is a really interesting point. Based on my experiences for example.. I recently got a good job, good gf, pretty good setup for myself. Thank God for that cuz quarantine would have been way worse. Compared to my peers, all of us in our mid 20s, I am doing a lot better on paper (not to brag but I worked really hard so). The Obsession seems like a perfect thing for people to use as an excuse, and creepily, even a life's purpose. Most of the people they hate on are people doing basic fun things for themselves. Like going to a Halloween party, or going on a date. It's really sad that some of these people might just be missing something in their life. A lot of the doomers I know do indeed have anxiety, which is ironic bc quarantine should be the biggest threat to that...</p>
<p>Anyone I have seen not worship the virus is usually self confident, like you said. They have hobbies they are really into, or are popular outside the internet. Some of us here question authority and actively oppose quarantine, but a lot of the people that are moderate about the subject that I described really just have real shit they are about, and power to them! We really just need people to value their time it seems. So glad you are a more confident person now! I feel that!</p>

        <p>My girlfriend is currently working as a substitute teacher at a middle school in CA. The good news is that everyone's been safe, no one's gotten sick, and there's been no reported cases of covid.</p>
<p>The bad news? There's already been 2 students struggling with severe anxiety and depression who have threatened to run away, 1 of which was considering suicide.</p>

        <p>I'm happy about it overall. It'll at least get people who want it ASAP the opportunity to have it. And hopefully at that point we can say goodbye to this lockdown bullshit and masks can be optional again and by the latter half of 2021 we can get back to living our lives comfortably and normally.</p>
<p>That being said, i'm probably going to wait a bit before I take it. Even if it works, there's obviously been no long term effects data collected since they don't have long term results. I'm gonna give it a year minimum... Maybe 2. Once it's clear it is truly safe and doesn't have damaging side effects, then i'll get it.</p>

<p>I hope it becomes like the Iraq War where everyone was for it in the hysteria and then it started becoming cool to oppose it. All of the shame we got here, all the work we did to bring these things to the surface... will almost be for naught. These hypocrites need to "discover" this on their own apparently.

<p>It's not strange at all once you realize that "religion" isn't so much about deities or even the content of beliefs themselves, but an overarching narrative/explanation and sense of community with fellow believers.</p>

        <p>I went to the gym yesterday, and for the first time the towels were actually in the locker rooms and fitness floor instead of being held hostage at the front desk. I took this as a good sign, but as I was changing clothes, a snarky announcement came on over the intercom telling everyone to wear masks at all times except eating in the cafe or exercising. I just grabbed my water bottle and a small bag of nuts so that I could be actively eating or drinking at any given time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then someone wore a mask while doing yoga. It was only one person, but I kept thinking "please don't give them any ideas". Why do some people insist on going above and beyond? Why can't they just suffocate themselves on their own time? Why do I keep paying to be treated like this?</p>

        <p>This is indeed an option, and I'm pretty sure my gym also has an option to freeze your membership for a couple of months. It's just so frustrating. I go to the gym almost every day (and sometimes more than once on my days off), and it's what gets me going. I already have my own yoga area almost set up in my apartment, and I have some other equipment as well. I just don't have a pool, hot tub, or a lot of extra space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really thought the election would be a turning point in all of this. I am going to wait a bit longer to see how things go. I just hate the idea of being forced out because of people who go to non-essential things (like gyms) and then complain that it's not safe to be in the non-essential place and ruin it for everyone. :(</p>

        <p>Has anyone had any luck making friends this year? Are there any group meetups, or something like tinder for drinking buddies not dates, or a website with personals or ANYWHERE that new friends are being made? </p>
<p>I moved somewhat recently, my local friends are doomers, who either just had kids (pretty sure the kids have only seen their parents since birth) or moved back in with their parents a state over. I only can make it home once or twice a year.</p>

        <p>I made a friend through work but one isn't enough. I'm not very social and that was my goal this year. I was going to go to meetups and stuff, I was going to socialize more. And now this happens and any avenues for friend making have disappeared for who knows how long. I even checked my general area's meetup subreddit and it was comprised of posts by people looking to form groups getting downvoted and berated for spreading coronavirus.</p>

        <p>I made a ton of new friends in my local libertarian community this year. Old normal style.</p>
<p>Of course, it helps that I'm of that political persuasion and in a state with a relatively high number of these people. Still, regardless of your own political beliefs, the people most likely to be openly living in defiance of this stuff are probably those who are freedom-minded.</p>
<p>I've also thought many times of making something like a craigslist style website for lockdown/new normal skeptics, but I'm not sure I have the skills or bandwidth to do that properly at all. I'm a software developer, but not the web type. And also not necessarily looking to make myself a target. I'd love to see someone else take it up.</p>

        <p>I'm moving to a more rural part of my state.  I love my new home, and everyone around there is really relaxed.  No one cares if you wear masks in stores.  My landlord shook my hand when we met.  People are friendly and talkative. I feel better already and want to thank everyone here who suggested moving to more rural areas.  I would never have realized, and thought everywhere was the same as my city.</p>

        <p>Just found out about the death of an acquaintance  - he lived in the most heavily locked down part of my country, he worked in the mental health field and has suffered mental illness himself. Not even that old (mid 50s). Barely knew the guy but the time we did spend together was wonderful.</p>
<p>Huge virtual hugs to any of you out there who are suffering from mental health problems during the lockdown. Please hang in there, we want you, we need you, the fact that you still exist makes the world a better place.</p>

        <p>I go to the gym 2-3 times a week. The mask requirement at the gym is probably the stupidest requirement I have encountered yet. I wear a very light piece of underarmour-like cloth that surely doesn’t do anything to begin with... </p>
<p>But the dumbest part is that everyone is touching their masks all the time. Myself included! I take it off after tough sets because I need to breathe and take a drink. </p>

        <p>I met this interesting woman in her late 60s today at the store. She was a complete stranger, but she was dressed to the nines in a stunning red dress with heels and had a pretty barrette in her hair. I noticed that her hair was almost gone, but her beauty could be compared to Christy Brinkley or Farrah Faucet. Her conversation with me was the mundane very hopeful and weather related stuff. However, she seemed to be wanting to tell someone about her disappointment that Thanksgiving parties have limits to allowed attendance this year. After she left the store with her items, I said a prayer for her that her Thanksgiving will be ok this year for ladies like her. Beyond her physical beauty was her genuine personality and love of people.</p>

        <p>Agreed.  People need to take a stand and not let the fear narrative control their lives.  I was disappointed that my GF's relatives have all cancelled their Thanksgiving <em>and</em> Christmas festivities on account of its being "unsafe".  My eyes rolled so hard that you could probably hear it.</p>

        <p>Why do my coworkers (we all work from home) ask us every Friday "anyone have any big plans for the weekend?!" Same for any upcoming holidays. </p>
<p>What are they expecting us to say? Of course we're only allowed to talk about boring "covid-safe" activities. If any of us are doing anything ""risky"", we keep it to ourselves, or we'd be opening ourselves up to snide and fake-concerned comments. I get the feeling that they're <em>hoping</em> someone will say they're planning to celebrate Thanksgiving normally or whatever so they can make a show of handwringing and "ooh how are you going to do that safely??" Ugh! </p>
<p>Im a lot quieter in the chats now because I just don't want to share anything about my life with these people anymore. Big or small. </p>
<p>I'm tired of the WFH life. My morale is in the toilet. I want to go back to the office, but they won't be bringing us back until sometime next year. All of my coworkers are huge doomers, or at least pretend to be to virtue signal. I used to consider some of them my friends, but I've lost a lot of respect for them with how they've reacted to the covid hysteria. I just feel so disconnected from everybody. I'm dreaming about a different career lately.</p>

        <p>Went to the emergency room tonight. Was playing softball and playing third base, girl hit the ball right underneath my eye. Bloody nose but thankfully no broken bones. I could have my fiancé in the waiting room but they wouldn’t let him in the room with me, that freaked me out. I did concussion tests and they said I don’t have one but I’m going to take it easy anyways.</p>

        <p>I have been having to go to the dr a lot for imaging and tests before a surgery. I only have one dr. That allows my husband to go with me. </p>
<p>That being said, once I am in the rroom w/ my dr, nurse or tech...all of them have been cool. Not even kidding, they dont force me to wear a mask in the room. Its usually them who brings it up, too. I certainly don’t bec I just assume I have to. </p>
<p>That being said—these are basically well visits or scans of my leg, things like that. If I was being seen for “cold or flu” like symptoms I wouldn’t expect them to be so willy nilly. But I appreciate it nonetheless</p>

<p>Watch for the APA to start pushing the narrative that "distrust in government" and interest in "conspiracy theories" are symptomatic of some new mental illness requiring commitment "for the sufferer's own good."</p>

        <p>My thoughts as of right now, sponsored by Ezra Brooks...</p>
<p>Part of the luxury of having my government job was that it was low-key and allowed me to do research and analysis during all the downtime. Now I am home trying to do virtual learning with one kid and teach preschool to the other and in my nighttime I want to do all the research and analysis but I usually find myself catching up on work that I didn't get done during the day. I had been writing a memoir for years; that's been on hold. My backyard garden this year fell to neglect. The kids gave me enough free time to install a new dishwasher and somehow in the moments I stepped to the bathroom or performed whatever task they wrote all over the walls.</p>
<p>Feels like r=P/C but time is literally being stolen from me. I'm asked to do all these tasks at once (which I'm pretty good at, but whatever) and still have the time I need to inform my opinion and mindset, something that will derivatively be projected upon my children.</p>
<p>In short, yeah, it's pretty obvious that making people stay home all the time with an incredible workload of pressure and stress is a good way to keep them from research an analytics, a blinder to what's going on around them.</p>
<p>Love to all. Stay normal.</p>

        <p>My colleague came round yesterday to drop off some paperwork. I'm stood in my doorway and she's on the patio, we're about a metre apart talking when she starts coughing in my fucking direction but it's okay guys, she's masked. Didn't bother to turn away and cough into her fucking arm or use her hand because she's got her magical covid-be-gone, ill-fitted mask on. I would much rather she was maskless and coughed into her hand away from me and then used anti-bac to clean her hands. Masked people take the high ground but they're so ill-mannered.</p>

        <p>People seem to be capable of only understanding and following one rule at a time. Wears a mask but doesn't distance. Wears a mask that they keep touching but doesn't wash their hands. Wears a mask but coughs in someone's face. And these are the same people telling us we're killing grandma.</p>

        <p>just found out today that my sister's wedding got called off because my home country's going into lockdown. I feel so numb and tired its unbelievable. this was the first wedding from my house and now I can't even experience that. South Asian weddings are something you never want to miss. I wanted some sort of escape from the trauma of the lockdowns that occurred in the country I currently reside in, since my home country barely adhered to any lockdown measures. I feel no more hope.</p>

        <p>I’ve seen peak covid nonsense this week.  Went to a restaurant for lunch, and went to the restroom just before we left.  A male employee wearing the required gloves comes into the bathroom and heads to the urinal to pee.  I didn’t wait for him to finish to see what he did, but I’m betting he either washed his hands (gloved) or just went back out to serve food. If he was going to remove them and get new, why didn’t he just remove them beforehand?</p>

        <p>Alright guess I'm posting twice in a week. My state has new restrictions, no indoor or outdoor gatherings of more than 10 people and also not more than 3 households. Restaurants and bars close to indoor dining at 10, and no standing bar games can be played. Wedding receptions and funerals are limited to 50 people starting this Friday and starting December 11th the limit is 25. Of course no end date for any of this. </p>
<p>My main thing is the gatherings thing. I know this isn't enforceable but when is this going to end? I was looking forward to a gathering that is probably not going to happen now. I was looking forward to making friends and was hoping to actually start dating again after being single for years. I'm losing time, seriously I'm a really awkward person and I'm starting to genuinely worry I'll never find a husband.</p>

        <p>Just started pondering whether we could solve this by a two systems one area system. Where every house business and venue is designated as “normal” or “safe”. Everyone in the normal system can continue as normal and everyone in other system can follow rules. I suppose one big problem is it could work in large metros with plenty of choices, but not in a smaller town without at least two options in every category.</p>

        <p>And they would be separate, but equal, right?</p>
<p>Fuck that. I'm all for people running their businesses how the see fit, but you just KNOW that the "normal" venues would get the shaft as far as utility rates, inspections etc, are concerned.</p>

        <p>I think some places are kind of implied without being explicitly stated. For example my local hardware store is always sanitizing everything, has the stickers on the floor and plexiglass on the counter.... you know the full getup. It’s always full of old people and they’ll even kick your ass out if you don’t cover your nose with the mask. Then on the other hand, the local country music dance hall, no one has a mask and they look at you funny if you keep one on. I’ve ever heard a comment from a patron saying, “You wear that thing while yo mama’s cookin dinner too?”. Seems like a lot of unwritten rules these days.</p>

        <p>My friend and I have similar aged kids. We used to get together daily. Both of us are sahms and we typically chat daily through messenger.</p>
<p>Anyway, around halloween we went out to eat and did trick or treating at FAMILYS houses. We actually do keep covid in mind and do think it’s a big deal but life too must happen. She’s been a lot more locked down and that’s her right. She won’t see us because my son goes to preschool unmasked. She chose to homeschool her preschooler. </p>
<p>She also says they avoid eating out and going to stores. Well, her husband posted a bunch of pictures of him and his son (who was unmasked) in a store. I’m just realizing that she isn’t my friend. I thought we were but she is making exceptions for everyone else and going places she judged me doing last week or so. I think I was just a convenience friend since we are both sahms. Covid has really shown me ppls true colors.</p>

        <p>I am about to go into my second grocery store of the day because chicken breasts and chicken tenders were cleaned out of the store I primarily shop at. I was looking for the latter but would have gotten chicken breast too. I hope people aren’t starting to hoard again. Wonder if there are any loony rumors about Wolf wanting a shutdown. Those ha e been circulating since July or August though...</p>

        <p>Sadly, I have no doubt a few people have quietly 'cancelled' me out since I'm anti-lockdown. If it happens, ah well it probably isn't that great of a loss. I've always thought I was likely the better person than such other people are, since I don't let the fact someone may have a different political view stop me from talking to another person.</p>
<p>If someone is annoyingly petty over that and stupidly stops talking to me as a petty result, ah well nothing I can do about that. And I've VERY long had a NO POLITICAL discussion (period!) rule on all my social media pages, myself. I don't want to be bothered thinking about that stuff, that's for sure!</p>

        <p>No, always be honest on stuff like this. You did the right thing. The truth is that people who believe the official narrative are weak and ignorant. And no, it's not mean nor wrong to know that or to admit it. better to be alone than to be with people like that, because they will make you more like them overtime.</p>

        <p>My guess is that the vaccine is going to have some side effects. Name the side effects that 15 percent of the trial received and MAYBE I will try the vaccine. Maybe. Something tells me that they're not going to tell us potential side effects.</p>

        <p>Tell me about it, I wake up every day with a sigh now and I'm so tired but keep pushing on and doing my own thing regardless. There's a part of me that still has hope that everything will go back to normal again because without that I would have no more of a reason to live in a world like this, it's miserable and bleak all over now.

        <p>I think you did well, with those comments. Of course sadly there's nothing you can do (sadly to say),  to change the mind(s) of those who are dead set in their own detrimental thought processes. If doomers don't want to think for themself and realize the overreaction to COVID was worser than the virus itself, then that's their own problem none of us anti-lockdown people can solve.</p>

        <p>Anyone else recall noticing a few years ago Reddit exceptionally insistent that every one should get a flu shot? Meanwhile I’ve always guidance has always been only high risk and close contacts need it, and that it’s completely optional for everyone else, and I believe a lot of other countries follow that a lot closer than the US. (Personally I do get it most years as low risk, figuring even milder symptoms are worth it).</p>

        <p>You will create antibodies better if you act like normal, no distancing, lockdowns, and masks. You people are disgusting wearing those snot rags on your face all day. You won't get healthy doing that. That comment does not imply that masks work. When you breath the air goes around the sides of the mask and spreads just as easily as without a mask. If people are coughing or sneezing than it is better to use a tissue or just turn your head. Nobody ever went around sneezing right in peoples face anyway. The world has always has sickness and disease. We lived are lives and we were fine.</p>

        <p>Last I checked on this and the other 2 anti-lockdown subs, we have MORE than only Trump supporters posting here. I've seen Biden supporters post/commment, Jorgensen(Libertarian) supporters, etc. For the record, I voted Jorgensen.</p>
<p>And check out r/lockdowncriticalleft , if you don't believe me that even people on the left were against this crap.</p>
<p>Seriously, do NOT do a comment stereotyping all of us. What you unnecessarily did there would be like me going over to r/coronavirus , and doing a rude comment stereotyping everyone there. In fact, I don't care about that latter sub one bit anyway, so you'll never see me do that anyway.</p>
