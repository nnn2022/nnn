    <strong>Costco and Target Shopping Experience Today: 20% Unmasked</strong>
    <p><p>My husband and I went shopping at Costco today and 20% of the people were not masked, including us. I never wore one, but my husband finally stopped when he saw a few others were not doing so. He bravely walked i to the stores without one.</p>
<p>No one gave us the evil eye either. My husband wondered why. I speculated because the government said it was finally ok. While at Target, I talked with two sets of people and let them know you don‚Äôt need the mask anymore‚Ä¶they didn‚Äôt know. One lady asked me in the bathroom about it. Another person and her friend ripped theirs off as soon as they headed out the door so I let them know.</p>
<p>The elites and their useful idiots have some more lessons coming their way. Lawsuits from high powered lawyers have already started. Trust me more backlash is on its way because they are not done pushing their crap. People are üò§ and more and more people will take action..especially parents.</p></p>

<p>I really don't mean to be cynical but do you think the people who make the laws are going to rule against themselves?  There is no accountability.  These people just don't give a fuck.</p>

        <p>No worries. I would be thinking the exact same thing if I hadn‚Äôt already seen a few of them getting punished. For example, Liz Chaney recently lost her chair position in the Republican party. A number of RINOs have been censured by their states GOP which basically destroys any chance of re-election especially since they now have MAGA opponents. </p>
<p>Right now the punishment is a lose of power. For some it could be going to trial for crimes against humanity in the future. For others they will get away with it, but things are being made painful for them at the very least.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure a number of lawyers involved in these large lawsuits have no ties to the people they are suing. It just isn‚Äôt one lawyer, they are teaming up in groups up to 1000.</p>

        <p>People didn't give you the stink eye probably because you are older and people assume you are vaxxed. I'm young though fully vaccinated and you don't want to believe how many stick eyes I got on May 19th when NY dropped the mandate. Literally EVERYONE in the store wearing a mask thought I was antivax trash lol üòÇ. Also I told about 10 people today at work they didn't need a mask in the store and I was so happy to see them put it away</p>

        <p>I was getting a lot of stink eyes up until last week when everyone thought they had to wear a mask. I got yelled at, bullied, and nicely ‚Äútalked‚Äù too by store managers and customers alike. Because I refused to wear a mask the entire time. </p>
<p>Glad you told a bunch of people they don‚Äôt need to wear the mask anymore.</p>

        <p>I work at a grocery store... and I think people need to remember that the employees aren‚Äôt enforcing masks bc they genuinely think you should have to wear them... it‚Äôs literally part of our job to mention something to you about it. We are held accountable by our fellow employees and management. I feel like people coming into stores and getting mad at the store for asking them to wear a mask is just fighting a total wrong fight... it‚Äôs literally people vs people at that point.... and your statement is not heard by the people actually affecting the big picture.</p>

        <p>First, no one is saying they are being forced to ask customers about mask wearing, they are just doing it with no explanation. So how are we to know.</p>
<p>Second, that is very wrong on managements part to ask employees to police their customers. It can be dangerous.</p>
<p>Third, many people won‚Äôt give a shit about your job if you are harrassing them about a mask that a number of people can not wear for various reasons. But, none of you cared about that. All you thought about was yourselves only.</p>
<p>Fourth, people did contact those in charge who could make a difference including lawsuits. The people at the top are finally getting push back and punishment from other powerful people. Why? Because people finally stood up to it.</p>
<p>So, yeah‚Ä¶don‚Äôt cry people a river over it. You could have gathered in groups with backing and fought back on it.</p>

        <p>Do they need an explanation? If there is a mandate then it should be common sense at that point. </p>
<p>As a private business anyone has the right to refuse service to anyone. It can be dangerous, but if we don‚Äôt enforce it then we have customers complaining that people aren‚Äôt wearing masks as well. So it‚Äôs lose lose for the employees honestly.</p>
<p>Most people don‚Äôt see you as human being or respect your work place as an employee, and they come off as very selfish. They take for granted that going into stores is a privilege, not a right. Not all people are like this though thankfully. </p>
<p>I don‚Äôt want to fight anyone. I just want to give respect and be respected. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre so angry.</p>

        <p>Going into a store is not a privilege, it is a business that is offering a service so they can make a living.</p>
<p>And yes, an explanation would have been the proper thing to do. You want understanding, then you have to explain things. A store is not a dictatorship, it is simply a business. Businesses have crossed the line with going into politics.</p>
<p>And yes, it is a loose loose for the employees. But because your management is corrupt, they decided to enforce something illegal and inhuman on so many levels. You may think it was the right thing to do, but it wasn‚Äôt. </p>
<p>Me and others will fight anyone who tries to take our freedoms and right to breath away. The masks don‚Äôt work, it was always about control and power grab from those who already have power and money.</p>

        <p>So many people in the world aren‚Äôt gifted the privilege of being born in a country where you can just drive to get your groceries (especially non essential items for that matter). We are fortunate we get to do that. It is a privilege. </p>
<p>The management wants people to feel safe and secure while shopping in a health food store. </p>
<p>Well while you‚Äôre whining about not being able to breath I‚Äôll be breathing just fine wearing a mask 8 hours a day 5 days a week for over a year now (because I would lose my job if I didn‚Äôt) .</p>
<p>Ps I think people should not be forced to wear masks. Just asking you to think of others. And how the lines are blurred not so black and white when you think of others</p>

        <p>Most people don't give a shit about the pandemic, they just want to go about their lives and be left the fuck alone. There is a small minority of people who will cause a scene... its either "oh my God where is your mask, I'm dying!" Or "wearing a mask like a sheep? Fucking pussy"</p>
