    <strong>German news accidentally shows Covid21 on E-passport.</strong>

<p>I been posting about leaky vaccines yet those posts get deleted. Coincidence?  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>" The EU has taken on the mammoth task of creating the conditions for a European vaccination certificate. If this succeeds on June 1st, it will be a masterpiece. How far is Brussels and what still needs to happen? The most important facts in the WELT-Check.  </p>
<p>The EU Parliament wants to vote on the European vaccination certificate on Thursday. This document is intended to enable easier travel from the summer onwards. It could be a milestone in returning to ancient freedoms. Is this realistic? After the vaccination chaos, the EU is facing another practical test. WELT answers the most important questions.  "<br>

        <p>they'll say it's a variant, even though when viruses mutate they get weaker, not stronger. </p>
<p>And it'll probably target the vaccinated. There goes half of the population. And they'll blame the unvaccinated, creating division and possible civil war.</p>

        <p>civil war is already brewing in North America and EU, it is fucking crazy. They are trying to divide us as much as possible with any possible way, be it race, gender, religion, class, and such.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>edit: also variants are not necessarily weaker, it is just that more deadly ones die out faster as they do not find another host in time.</p>

        <p>It has to happen at this point. Just look at Europe's immigration. We are unarmed and facing ISIS "veterans".
Funny, earlier this week a popular political figure tweeted how we should consider ISIS veterans to be our new "war heroes", you know like those who defended us from the Soviet occupation. Modern leftism will die but it will anger a shit ton of people before it does.</p>

        <p>The most deadly virus strains kill off their hosts faster than the virus can spread widely. The most successful viruses for replication and survival don't kill the host (or like AIDS take a long time to kill the host), take a little while to manifest so people keep doing their normal routine while infectious, and create symptoms that facilitate the spread such as sneezing and coughing.</p>
<p>If the deadliest strains kill their hosts. The variants that survive in living hosts and can spread are the successful variants. These are less deadly.</p>

        <p>By this thinking, if a germ requires a mobile host to spread, its  virulence will, of necessity, decline. Like the older conventional  wisdom, the theory of virulence recognizes that many germs will evolve  less virulence as they circulate and adapt to the human population. But  Ewald’s theory also proposes that germs all have their own strategies to  spread, and some of those strategies allow the germ to maintain high  virulence <em>and</em> transmissibility.</p>
<p>Durability, Ewald says, is one such strategy. Variola virus, which  causes smallpox, is very durable in the external environment, and it can  have a high death rate of 10 to 40 percent. Ewald calls it and other  durable germs “sit-and-wait” pathogens. Some deadly infections are  spread from very sick hosts by vectors: fleas, lice, mosquitos, or  ticks. Others, such as cholera, are spread in water. Still others, such  as hospital-acquired staph infections, are spread by people taking care  of the sick or dying. This is what happened in the women’s hospitals of  the 19th century, when doctors spread puerperal or “childbed” fever from  one postpartum woman to another.</p>
<p>Compared to influenza viruses, coronaviruses are more stable and less  likely to evolve in response to pre-existing immunity. As a result,  <strong>experts believe safe and effective vaccines remain the best chance  for escaping the maze of Covid-19 infection. Regular boosters may be  necessary as the virus cycles, not because the virus is rapidly  evolving, but because human immunity may wane.</strong></p>
<p>Such an outcome would mark the end of this current pandemic. Yet  even then, experts believe, some version of the virus will continue to  circulate, perhaps as a common cold virus or an occasional deadly  outbreak among the unvaccinated, for many years, if not forever.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm the type to believe the world could secretly be run by glocialist goblins, but I have trouble believing they are that careless.  Unless they let things slip on purpose, so that people who pick up on it are thought to be crazy.</p>

        <h1>if they must go trough with it ... let them have their "vaccinated only" circles ... as long as we can have our "everyone welcome" circles</h1>
<p>------</p>
<p>i am a coward in physical life</p>
<p>i hate confrontations and to a certain degree i could consider myself addicted to social harmony</p>
<p>that is how i have spent the last 10 years to great parts on the internet writing and otherwise depicting my visions of how i wish human society could evolve</p>
<p>now about this so called vaccination passport</p>
<p>i have allready written about it partly when i wrote some days ago that i was partly relieved to read about the WHO to not fully support the introduction of the vaccination passport</p>
<p>my personal oppinion is that vaccines all in all are not a good thing, that they bring more damages than benefits and its the same attrocity like child-baptism to vaccinate a child or a mentally challenged person against its consent</p>
<p>but then ... if people really are dedicated to go trough with this, create a society where</p>
<p>only the ones who wear the mark of the monster can travel, shop and congregate ... why stand in their way</p>
<p>let them have it, let them have a go at it, let them fullfill their fantasy of segregation, their self-justified circle of the ones baptised by the pharmaceutical companies injecting a chemical cocktail in their bloodstream</p>
<p>just one meagre question i may ask ... let us who for sure never will want to join your</p>
<p>vaccinated only circles ... let us make our own circles</p>
<p>please do not block our lives completly so we have no chance to travel, no possibility to shop or congregate</p>
<p>please, if you absolutly must go trough with your chemical circle scheme ... let us who</p>
<p>trust more in our own cellular intelligence than into the intelligence of the brain of someone who cooks up a vaccine connoction in a laboratory ... let us who would any day</p>
<p>take on any virus and bacteria because they are our friends and not our enemies ...</p>
<p>let us create our own virus and bacteria friendly circles where everyone is allowed</p>
<p>to congregate, vaccinated or not</p>
<p>and then let us see</p>
<p>which circles succeed, which social networks in physical space manage to satisfy their</p>
<p>users and how we possibly can each one in its own belief systems continue to both follow our trust into what we want to trust:</p>
<p>the ones believing in vaccines trusting in pharmaceutical industry spending time in the vaccine only circles</p>
<p>the ones believing in the bodys ability to self-heal all challenges and not willing to bet</p>
<p>ones wellbeing on pharmaceutical industry, the ones who like to be friends with viruses and bacteria trusting that they have our human beings best interest in their program ... we would set up then our own circles where everyone would be welcome what ever they would choose to shoot into their venes ahem whatever substances they would choose to inform their cellular body intelligence with</p>
<p>mmmh...</p>
<p>additional to all of the above</p>
<p>i live in the geographical space what today is occupied by the nation state of switzerland, I was born in the town of st.gallen around 45 years ago.</p>
<p>as i wrote before of me being shy to engage myself in physical life confrontations,</p>
<p>i am very reluctanct to engage in local political non-digital activities</p>
<p>i tried it 20 years ago but i was not able to go trough with it</p>
<p>since about 3 months i stopped following the daily news from the region where i live</p>
<p>it just gave me too much pain to read all the time what or what not the federal council, these 7 people who are elected by the few hundred national representatives sitting in the</p>
<p>national parliamentary assembly ... what these 7 people abusing emergency law now more or less constantly since about a year ... would have had the graciousness to let us 8.4 million fellow people let do with each other ... wether we were allowed to meet together</p>
<p>to drink a hot or cold beverage in a public place or watch a movie on a big screen, wether or not we would be allowed to dance together</p>
<p>even to write this is surreal ... like ... what ... 7 people decide what 8.4 million people can do or can not do together</p>
<p>what is this , a horror movie, some sort of political nightmare ?</p>
<p>anyway ... i just could not take it anymore</p>
<p>some days ago then i wondered what my fellow people in switzerland would be up to</p>
<p>regarding the vaccine passport stuff</p>
<p>and it was a desaster</p>
<p>in one article i read from middle of march 2021 there was basicly all the political parties except for one going along with the idea of vaccine passports for the schengen - space , the wider political space where the european union and switzerland have agreements</p>
<p>for regarding border controls</p>
<p>and the one party opposing the idea of a vaccination passport is the party what is</p>
<p>traditionally the party what has values like not wanting to invite refugees into switzerland, rejecting people who ask for help, give less support to people who ask for</p>
<p>social wellfare finances ... the party who basicly is full of people i really do not want to be with because i do believe it being of utmost importance for the healing of the human psyche that we welcome refugees as much as we are able to, that we help anyone who asks for help, that we support anyone who ask for social wellfare finances</p>

        <p>mmmh... how to end this writeup here</p>
<p>ah ja</p>
<p>that is how:</p>
<p>i would like once more to propose a most simple way out of this madness what we human beings experience at this moment ... a way what could be described in three simple steps:</p>
<p>1 ) pharmaceutical and surgical quick fixes never work fully... they mostly weaken the natural immune systems self-healing capacities</p>
<p>anyone who is abusing emergency laws to divert people s attention away from their own self-healing capacities and towards the pharmaceutical /surgical medicine business makes itself a complice towards a dehumanising depopulation agenda what envisions the avarage citizen as complying with every chemical/pharmaceutical business furthering political regulation, feeding itselve voluntarily with health-deteriorating sterilising toxic chemicals</p>
<p>to insist on freedom of movement, freedom of assembly being most important for body autonomy</p>
<p>( to be able to choose at all times where to be with whom is an essential requirement for supporting ones body fitness wellness ) equates opposing global guidelines locking down/phasing out individual personal sovereign behaviour</p>
<p>=</p>
<p>lockdown, masks, vaccines</p>
<p>bad</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>free movement, free assembly, body autonomy</p>
<p>good</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>2 ) regional state and nation state dominating the local community ( village/town/city ) = bad</p>
<p>sollution: renewal of states constitutions so that all political hierarchies get dissolved and all political decision powers get shifted towards the local community, abdication of regional and nation state in favor of the local community receiving full absolute sovereignity</p>
<p>the (full) assembly of all children, youth and adults being permanent residents of the local community, each one with the very same weighted voting power, creating, maintaining and interpreting the laws what are valid within the territory of the local sovereign community</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>3 ) once the local community has become its own absolute sovereign, it might use the inherited material and financial wealth of the abdicated regional and nation state to buy agricultural and forest land from private owners ... with the intention to redistribute land towards everyone who does not have private wealth</p>
<p>a lifetime loan of 1000 m2 without tax duty without rent duty envisioned for every human being on earth so that everyone may be free of having to serve anyone else, so that everyone may be free to build its own house with its own hands and grow its own vegan foodstuffs</p>
<p>-------------------------------------</p>
<p>------------------</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>but how could we fullfill step 2, how could be possibly renew the constitutions of regional and nation states so that all political decision powers would reach the local sovereign community</p>
<p>possibly using concepts like:</p>
