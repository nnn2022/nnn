    <strong>The publicfreakouts subreddit glamourizes violence again</strong>
    <p><p>The amount of videos of people attacking others unprovoked because of masks is insane. And the comments all celebrate it. I don't understand. What is wrong with this people? Are they mentally ill?</p></p>

        <p>If people opened a history book they would be baffled at how Hitler rose to power and how the Germans started accepting and support violence against innocent people because of the propaganda that was put out . Have you seen that video of Canada where that young girl refused to put on a mask in public outside? The cops started beating her and bystanders were cheering. </p>
<p>This was a test and most people have proven that the old methods still work to this day.</p>

        <p>The first goal is intimidation. They want you to be afraid.</p>
<p>The second goal is normalization. They want this to be expected.</p>
<p>The third goal is motivation. They want their minions to go forth and do the will of the State voluntarily and without directing.</p>

        <p>It is very interesting to see. I love that everything these people are just gets confirmed over and over. They literally will give you everything wrong with them themselves just with a few questions you ask. They are to blind to even see it.</p>

        <p>That sub has a list of "provocations" where violence is in their minds fully justified or even "peaceful". Nothing is out of line when you're on "the right side of history".</p>

        <p>Those folks are weak and pathetic and have been bullied their entire lives and did nothing to stand up for themselves. I've discussed this extensively in other posts if you're interested in reading about what is going on. </p>
<p>These folks have deep-seated emotional issues as a result of being unable to stand up for themselves. They so desperately want to unleash their impotent rage on someone they perceive to be strong and/or successful, but they know that if they tried that they would get sent to the hospital.</p>
<p>Enter the COVID Era: now, there are folks who will do this for them, and quite successfully. The government and Big Business punishing self-sufficient and capable people is how they get their violent catharsis. </p>
<p>The immoral actions of those institutions are a proxy for the violence these folks wish they could commit against those that they perceive to be more capable than themselves. </p>
<p>You'll see them gloating online when someone who appears to be conservative gets beaten up (especially by the police,) and they will spam messages like "fuck around and find out" over and over again. </p>
<p>When they go out to the store, and a jacked biker is walking around with no mask? You'd best bet that the internet warrior will not be the one trying to force him to cover his face. </p>
<p>He will stand around furious that the biker would have the audacity to exist in his natural state and is capable of defending himself should someone try to physically confront him. </p>
<p>The internet warrior will seethe over how someone (that is not him) needs to stand up to this bad man and physically harm him for his transgressions against the weak and incapable. </p>
<p>They are a bunch of wusses - and we need to acknowledge that. They will vote time and time again to give power to institutions and individuals that will commit harm and oppress those that they disagree with. They are the greatest threat to our society right now.</p>

        <p>Remember when the recommendation to wear masks first came about? And they said it was to stop splatter from spit drops (which is the one thing masks actually might help with). People chose not to wear them because the chances someone spits in your mouth are so low and it seemed stupid.  Then the doomers started walking around saying 'BuT wHat if I wEre tO sPit iN yoUr mOuTh'. Like when has that ever happened...</p>
