    <strong>How is it possible that a generation that grew up with Dystopian worlds as a genre in film and literature doesn't recognize the similarities?</strong>
    <p><p>Books like The Hunger Games, dozens of other movies like Maze Runner. TV shows like Utopia Falls. Books like The Giver and again The Hunger Games.
Old classics of course: 1984, Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, ... </p>
<p>I just browsed through some book lists on dystopian topics and saw these recommendations for teenagers and tweens and I wonder how with so much stuff out there (I googled around, watched some YouTube videos, even the low quality stuff is eerie) depicting mass control, loss of freedom and the like, being hugely popular, too, how this generation is the one lapping it up the hardest. 
I don't understand.</p></p>

        <p>Yes!!! I was wondering the same exact thing. I graduated high school last year, and I remember all throughout middle and high school, we specifically read lots of dystopian novels for this very purpose. That a dystopia starts with a brainwashed, naive, gullible society that believes in the empty promises of the government, and then it happens and everyone is okay with it. I remember specifically my teacher saying, "Remember, dystopias never start by a government outright telling you their plans. That didn't happen in Nazi Germany, and it won't happen like that if we have another dystopian society like that. They will trick you. Don't forget it." Now I'm sure all those teachers are probably super pro-new normal.</p>

        <p>I figured there was some sort of weird normalization/desensitization that occured. They are still sitting on their comfy couches watching a lot of it happen through a screen. Then they go outside and deny it because nothing is on fire in their neighborhood. I dont know though I'm no psychologist.</p>

        <p>They just see themselves in a different dystopian story than we do.</p>
<p>Where "unvaccinated" people are the bad guys, that "white supremacists" etc are a majority of people, and even with all large corporations, all governments, all media, etc, they still are having a tough time defeating the hordes of racists and bigots, and that they need to use even more extreme methods, like the heros in movies got to use violence to dole out justice, they fantasize using violence to destroy anyone not wearing a mask etc.</p>

        <p>Critical Thinking university style is double speak. Or new speak. They use that word so you think it’s about thinking. It really about training people not to think for themselves and to only use NPR/NYT to do their thinking for them.</p>

        <p>Yes. I am a teacher and my students read The Giver. This book really touches upon a society that tries to control the population for the greater good. In order to erase pain and suffering, good memories and love are also destroyed. Have we learned nothing? Harrison Bergeron is also a great short story that warns against trying to make all people equal.</p>

        <p>It is the type of dystopia in media.</p>
<p>Ask yourself, what side causes the fictional dystopian society--right or left? It's invariably the right wing. This ingrains it into people's minds that we have to fear the right wing trying to impose a totalitarian Nazi-style regime on us. As a result, they gravitate toward the left wing, and swallow it down whole. </p>
<p>In short, a lot of people don't think an evil, tyrannical government can be left wing. So when "their" people are in power, their guard is down. They don't think the left wing could possibly want anything but sunshine and roses for them. The true irony is that the left wing <em>is</em> trying to create a dystopian society, and the right wing is largely controlled opposition.</p>

        <p>I think its a mix of the frog in the boiling water analogy mixed with a little of the "first, they came for the xxx, and I said nothing" mentality. </p>
<p>Slowly but surely, we are seeing more and more liberties be whittled away. And it isn't happenning to everyone equally at once. </p>
<p>That way "They" could play the sides against each other, and have the common people keep thinking that we, each other are the problems. The blacks are fine when its happening to the whites, bc its about time that white people got their comeuppance. White people turn a blind eye to the Black/indigenous cultures being undermined by outside forces, keeping them perpetually suckling from the State (on a national and international basis), turning blind eyes to injustices unless they are the flavor of the month. Women are happy when men get fucked over, bc fuck the "cis"tem that created that wage gap and treated them as second class citizens for all of human history. </p>
<p>The thing is, the people controlling the BLM movements, the "pussy hat" movements, the mask hysteria, all this progressive shit, are the Soros' and the Gates' of the world. Its just a bunch of old rich white men using the ignorant masses to serve their ideals and business interests.</p>
<p>More and more people are waking up, and its because of the authors of our past who gave us these warnings to prepare us for when history repeats itself.</p>

        <p>I would think that it being in movies makes people think it is just that -- something that only happens in the movies. Books and movies aren't necessarily designed to be parallels of reality. There might be an underlying theme to relate to, but I don't think anyone's ever thought "Hmm, the Hunger Games seems bad. I will look out for it happening in the future."</p>
<p>There's also an American stereotype to think that "My country is the best at everything" when that clearly hasn't been the case for a few decades now. I think that the stereotype still exists in the minds of most teenagers though. As a result, they may be more reluctant to notice flaws in their country because it would go against the stereotype that they know so well.</p>

        <p>People fall into two groups: Mappers and Stackers.</p>
<p>Stackers put 'facts' or 'ideas' in stacks. Each new idea is based on previous ideas. If they are presented with proof that a fact is false, the whole stack is damaged. They will resist that.</p>
<p>Mappers organize facts in large mental diagrams. Facts are related to other facts, but not dependent on them. If a fact is proven false, they can easily re-arrange the diagram. Mappers enjoy new facts.</p>
<p>Most people are stackers.</p>

        <p>Because they had to hyperbolise and exaggerate the dystopia for film... hunger games is a step beyond... some sort of “sport bad” leads to ultra competitiveness for survival mantra. </p>
<p>1984 on the other hand is more subtle as is brave new world.. </p>
<p>In fact one professor commented that he couldn’t actually teach brave new world anymore - because the concept was lost on kids that it’s a dystopia... they like the idea of free drugs - sex and think of it as some utopia. No competition - everyone in line and having these drug enduced parties. </p>
<p>Even the new series brave new world did a disservice as painting the dystopia with a notion that it could be termed a utopia. </p>
<p>All this leads people to misidentify and not understand the importance of actual freedom. They think they have freedom as long as there is no overt “violence”. They are happy in a “conformist” drug induced, free sex - devoid of real value of family and traditional values and freedoms.</p>
<p>None of the Hollywood “dystopias” are anywhere close of what a dystopia is really like.... and Hollywood has purposefully either miscategorised 1984 and brave new world or not emphasized the subtleness of what losing freedoms and integrity really means.</p>

        <p>Because those YA books weren't very good at making you realize how horrible the dystopia was, because all it took was the right plucky teenager to dismantle the system. Most of the modern generation of wokies see themselves as this plucky teen who will change the world, because that's how YA novels are written. I mean, they unironically refer to themselves as "The Resistance" for heaven's sake.</p>
<p>They also don't read the classics anymore, or are told they were from an era when the focus was the "narrow-minded fear of communism" and told to ignore it. The warnings are downplayed or demonized. In addition, when was the last time children were taught critical thinking skills? Standardized testing threw that out the window in the early 90s, and you can see the results of that clearly today.</p>

        <p>Most of the stories you showed us have holy end. They tell the story of a struggle but with positive end. They romanticise oppression.</p>
<p>What was close to real socialism was recent Chernobyl tv series, which showed quite real side of ever present saddens and state that didn’t care about people. Since my family lived in such socialist utopia this seems to align with what they were telling me.</p>
<p>Now when I think about it it was closer to lockdowns we have now. You were supposed to stay (close to) home, go work, back, get drunk.</p>

        <p>- the young ones are not free at all ... since thousands of years is it stupid adults who believe that they have the right to force onto children what they should have to eat, wear, do at what time of the day and night ... childhood in human species is like a prison</p>
<p>- previous generations have wrecked our environment so massively with dumping toxic nuclear radioactive garbage into the oceans, digging mining holes into earth many kilometres deep to rob the earth from minerals, metals, fossils just to waste it all by inefficient use of it, creating a throw away product cycle where products last not as long as they could would they have been engineered to last long ...  </p>
<p>so it is understandable that the young ones are not sure anymore if their own body is capable enough to do all the cleaning of ones inner house / body work with all the environment wrecked by the boomer generation</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>this insecurity wether the body is capable or not to take on this coronavirus and learn from it  ... is one reason why a youth / young one today is leaning towards giving in to the evil trickery of the boomers generation to cover up all the environmental wreckage done during the past 50 years as well as to just skip the whole reparation for colonialism and feudalism chapter ... what has not even yet been started really on the global awareness theater stage ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>basically ... what happens today is the ones who are sitting on wealth generated trough 2000 years of empire style feudalism, 500 years of church supported colonialism, who used the loot from all this abusive behaviour against their fellow human beings and nature to further go for the big hollowing out of earth taking all the gold, silver, copper, diamonds, oil, gas etc. they could grab during the last 50 years ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>and now when it seems that the young ones want this environmental wrecking to end and some reparations happening towards the indigenous people and the enslaved people abducted from africas ... brought to the americas against their wishes </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>now when the future voters are growing up knowing all these past atrocities   </p>
<p>the rich boomers go for the final kill</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>wipe out everyones memory by hooking them up to first half yearly then eventually monthly up to perhaps weekly doses of vaccines  </p>
<p>( because the vaccines can never fully cover all the mutations and the weaker people get by all the chemicals injected into them the less capable their immune system will be so they will rely more and more on more frequently updated new downloads coming from the pharmaceutical companies laboratories ... )</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>so ... what I am trying to say here ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>there is more to it than just the young ones being confused and giving in to this long prepared attack on every sort of freedom we ever had</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>there is more to it than the young ones not understanding how this series of lockdowns, threatening of quarantine, upstyling of vaccines as the ultimate sollution ... is the big kill attempt, the final countdown ... the end game ... of the very same generation what is not willing to do the necessary economic changes to wreck the environment more ... of the very same generation what was advocating for nuclear power generation even when it was long evident how toxic the leftovers are, how dangerous an accident at such a power plant is ... the very same generation who voted for politicians to get into office or stay in office who continued to use tax payers money to build an nuclear weapons arsenal with the potential to destroy, pulverise, blast to dust ... the planet several times over  </p>
<p>because of all the reluctance of the boomer generation to do the right thing</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>some part of the young generation mistakenly believes that these abusers of today might one day stop climate change and use tax money to repare social unfairness of the past several hundred years</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>please do understand me in the way I mean it ...  </p>
<p>I do not believe in taxes being coerced from anybody ... I do not believe that big governement is any good ... even if they would go 150 percent environmentally friendly and would use the coerced tax money to repair all the injustice what came from european people enslaving africans and stealing the land of indigenous people on turtle island</p>
<p>( a name for north america used by some indigenous groups ) </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>even if they would do what they never intended to do ... as they are just the evil fuckers which they show themselves now openly during the great vaccination rollout ... </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>it would not be the correct way</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>seen from my viewpoint ... the only correct way how to repair environmental damage and how to heal intergenerational social abuse trauma coming from transatlantic slave trade, theft of lands of indigenous people ...  </p>
<p>the only decent way this can ever work  </p>
<p>is voluntarily</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>with everyone who wants to be part of the positive change ... doing voluntarily its very own part to help it</p>

        <p>i am a coward in physical life</p>
<p>i hate confrontations and to a certain degree i could consider myself addicted to social harmony</p>
<p>that is how i have spent the last 10 years to great parts on the internet writing and otherwise depicting my visions of how i wish human society could evolve</p>
<p>now about this so called vaccination passport</p>
<p>i have allready written about it partly when i wrote some days ago that i was partly relieved to read about the WHO to not fully support the introduction of the vaccination passport</p>
<p>my personal oppinion is that vaccines all in all are not a good thing, that they bring more damages than benefits and its the same attrocity like child-baptism to vaccinate a child or a mentally challenged person against its consent</p>
<p>but then ... if people really are dedicated to go trough with this, create a society where<br>
only the ones who wear the mark of the monster can travel, shop and congregate ... why stand in their way</p>
<p>let them have it, let them have a go at it, let them fullfill their fantasy of segregation, their self-justified circle of the ones baptised by the pharmaceutical companies injecting a chemical cocktail in their bloodstream</p>
<p>just one meagre question i may ask ... let us who for sure never will want to join your<br>
vaccinated only circles ... let us make our own circles</p>
<p>please do not block our lives completly so we have no chance to travel, no possibility to shop or congregate</p>
<p>please, if you absolutly must go trough with your chemical circle scheme ... let us who<br>
trust more in our own cellular intelligence than into the intelligence of the brain of someone who cooks up a vaccine connoction in a laboratory ... let us who would any day<br>
take on any virus and bacteria because they are our friends and not our enemies ... <br>
let us create our own virus and bacteria friendly circles where everyone is allowed<br>
to congregate, vaccinated or not</p>
<p>and then let us see</p>
<p>which circles succeed, which social networks in physical space manage to satisfy their <br>
users and how we possibly can each one in its own belief systems continue to both follow our trust into what we want to trust:</p>
<p>the ones believing  in vaccines trusting in pharmaceutical industry spending time in the vaccine only circles</p>
<p>the ones believing in the bodys ability to self-heal all challenges and not willing to bet <br>
ones wellbeing on pharmaceutical industry, the ones who like to be friends with viruses and bacteria trusting that they have our human beings best interest in their program ... we would set up then our own circles where everyone would be welcome what ever they would choose to shoot into their venes ahem whatever substances they would choose to inform their cellular body intelligence with</p>

        <p>mmmh...</p>
<p>additional to all of the above</p>
<p>i live in the geographical space what today is occupied by the nation state of switzerland, i was born in the town of st.gallen around 45 years ago.</p>
<p>as i wrote before of me being shy to engage myself in physical life confrontations,<br>
i am very reluctanct to engage in local political non-digital activities</p>
<p>i tried it 20 years ago but i was not able to go trough with it</p>
<p>since about 3 months i stopped following the daily news from the region where i live<br>
it just gave me too much pain to read all the time what or what not the federal council, these 7 people who are elected by the few hundred national representatives sitting in the <br>
national parliamentary assembly ... what these 7 people abusing emergency law now more or less constantly since about a year ... would have had the graciousness to let us 8.4 million fellow people let do with each other ... wether we were allowed to meet together<br>
to drink a hot or cold beverage in a public place or watch a movie on a big screen, wether or not we would be allowed to dance together</p>
<p>even to write this is surreal ... like ... what ... 7 people decide what 8.4 million people can do or can not do together</p>
<p>what is this , a horror movie, some sort of political nightmare ?</p>
<p>anyway ... i just could not take it anymore</p>
<p>some days ago then i wondered what my fellow people in switzerland would be up to<br>
regarding the vaccine passport stuff</p>
<p>and it was a desaster</p>
<p>in one article i read from middle of march 2021 there was basicly all the political parties except for one going along with the idea of vaccine passports for the schengen - space , the wider political space where the european union and switzerland have agreements<br>
for regarding border controls</p>
<p>and the one party opposing the idea of a vaccination passport is the party what is<br>
traditionally the party what has values like not wanting to invite refugees into switzerland, rejecting people who ask for help, give less support to people who ask for <br>
social wellfare finances ... the party who basicly is full of people i really do not want to be with because i do believe it being of utmost importance for the healing of the human psyche that we welcome refugees as much as we are able to, that we help anyone who asks for help, that we support anyone who ask for social wellfare finances</p>
<p>mmmh... how to end this writeup here</p>
<p>ah ja</p>
<p>that is how:</p>

<p>i would like once more to propose a most simple way out of this madness what we human beings experience at this moment ... a way what could be described in three simple steps:</p>
<p>1 ) pharmaceutical and surgical quick fixes never work fully... they mostly weaken the natural immune systems self-healing capacitiesanyone who is abusing emergency laws to divert people s attention away from their own self-healing capacities and towards the pharmaceutical /surgical medicine business makes itself a complice towards a dehumanising depopulation agenda what envisions the avarage citizen as complying with every chemical/pharmaceutical business furthering political regulation, feeding itselve voluntarily with health-deteriorating sterilising toxic chemicalsto insist on freedom of movement, freedom of assembly being most important for body autonomy( to be able to choose at all times where to be with whom is an essential requirement for supporting ones body fitness wellness ) equates opposing global guidelines locking down/phasing out individual personal sovereign behaviour</p>
<p>------------------<br>
lockdown, masks, vaccines  </p>
<p>bad  </p>
<p>-----------------<br>
free movement, free assembly, body autonomy  </p>
<p>good  </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>2 ) regional state and nation state dominating the local community <br>
( village/town/city )   </p>
<p>= bad  </p>
<p>sollution: renewal of states constitutions so that all political hierarchies get dissolved and all political decision powers get shifted towards the local community, abdication of regional and nation state in favor of the local community receiving full absolute sovereignitythe (full) assembly of all children, youth and adults being permanent residents of the local community, each one with the very same weighted voting power, creating, maintaining and interpreting the laws what are valid within the territory of the local sovereign community  </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------  </p>
<p>3 ) once the local community has become its own absolute sovereign, it might use the inherited material and financial wealth of the abdicated regional and nation state to buy agricultural and forest land from private owners ... with the intention to redistribute land towards everyone who does not have private wealtha lifetime loan of 1000 m2 without tax duty without rent duty envisioned for every human being on earth so that everyone may be free of having to serve anyone else, so that everyone may be free to build its own house with its own hands and grow its own vegan foodstuffs</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>but how could we fullfill step 2, how could be possibly renew the constitutions of regional and nation states so that all political decision powers would reach the local sovereign community</p>
<p>possibly using concepts like:</p>
<p>----  </p>
<p>the local community, the village, the town, the city-district is its own absolute political sovereign. it receives/inherits all political decision powers from both the regional state as well as from the nation state</p>
<p>the local sovereign community creates, maintains and interpretes the local law, a set of rules what all inhabitants living here and now, permanent residents, are agreeing upon in an every resident including manner. this local law replaces all laws previously made on both regional state level as well as on nation state level</p>
<p>all local sovereign communities receive/inherit a share of the financial and material wealth of both the regional state as well as of the nation state, the size of the share corresponding to the number of communal residents</p>
<p>every local sovereign community at all times is able without conditions to leave/quit/exit both the regional state as well as the nation state  </p>

        <p>It's like they used the media to convince people that living in that world would make them courageous heroes.  Now the sick people that dreamed of a world full of death and chaos got a taste of it and don't want to let go.  They can call themselves heroes and leaders while at the same time silencing their opposition.</p>

<p>The least conscious and lowest sense of "I" people default to group consensus narratives no matter how contradictory they are.</p>
<p>Since they're already low on awareness, they literally can't fathom how subconscious programming is basically a free pass to control them since they've never had that locust to begin with.</p>

        <p>My knowledge of modern dystopian literature is limited to decadent Hollywood stuff I happened to be subjected to, so I may be rather wrong. Also, quite biased and partisan. From what I have seen, modern dystopian fiction - and old fiction too, to some extent - seems to converge to a depiction of a society based on a few extreme gimmicks. Very rigid societal systems, globe-engulfing catastrophes, total resource depletion, miraculous and disastrous technologies. A virus, whatever its lethality may be, seems to fit in this category. However, that's where similarities end to me. First unconscious presumption is equating the world "before" with our own world, and equating our own world with the default, "normal" way of thing, therefore categorizing the dystopian world as an aberration. We know, that the world didn't suddenly went bad or was overtaken by the bad guys in 2020, don't we? Second unconscious presumption is strange understanding of politics and revolutions. While the world revolution is commonly associated with violence, destruction, protests, it merely means a radical change of thinking and happens entirely within people's minds, not in a physical world. Protagonists in dystopias never seem to bother with creating a coherent ideological system in opposition to the current order. Instead, there seems to be already an existing "default" revolutionary idea, to which they can attach themselves easily. Quite often, the masses already essentially support the idea too, they just wait the hero to lead them for some reason. Pre-existing groups of "good guys", maybe even ancient ones, are perfectly suited to replace the "bad guys", whose motivation is usually vague and barely existent, outlandish and inapplicable to our world at best. Tyranny is easily recognizable, people go along with it until they just suddenly don't, the "rebels" committing morally questionable acts makes the confusion even greater.</p>

        <p>They do think they're in a dystopian nightmare, but that "unvaccinated" people are the bad guys, that "white supremacists" etc are a majority of people, and even with all large corporations, all governments, all media, etc, they still are having a tough time defeating the hordes of racists and bigots, and that they need to use even more extreme methods, like the heros in movies got to use violence to dole out justice, they fantasize using violence to destroy anyone not wearing a mask etc.</p>

        <p>I read 1984 back in high school 15 years ago roughly. At that time I could easily see we were already living in a dystopian society and that 99% of people just wanted to fit in or go with the flow instead of questioning anything. At that point I knew we really stood zero chances. K-rino said it best “You are a tool and the hidden hand is using you. Please don’t be delusional, the rulers of this world practice confusing you”</p>

        <p>These movies desensitized people toward a dystopian future. A lot of them have happy endings, too, and give the viewer a "hero complex" which leads them to believe someone will save them in the end.</p>
<p>There are no heroes.</p>
<p>People who actually read books like It Can't Happen Here, 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World, etc. usually get it.</p>
<p>Movies have all the programming with none of the thinking.</p>
<p>People also saw The Matrix and didn't realize it was a metaphor for the system we live in. (More now than ever.)</p>

        <p>That was the point of the movies, to desensitize people to those ruined societies. They are also a form of disclosure, how many times have we seen the Matrix being quoted in the past year?

        <p>Because the goal of this thing is destruction. They don't mind you being angry on Reddit. They don't mind you joining their (planned) protests. They want to destroy your government/monarchy and replace it with an anti-Christ theocracy. For that, they need you to be angry. The anti-government sentiment in this sort of sub is very useful to them. Look up the 7 Noahide Laws and you'll see what I mean.</p>

        <p>Whenever I have redpill discussions with my teenage niece, she sometimes makes a comparison with Hunger Games that goes over my head because I am not familiar with the story. I will describe why some phenomenon really occurs and she will say something like, "that's like District 13" and I have no idea what she means. It makes me want to read the books now so that I can do a better job at making these connections which helps when I explain these things.</p>

        <p>Do not discount using popular culture as a way to get younger people to start thinking critically. Though a lot of it is woke garbage, there are some redpill gems underneath the surface.</p>
<p>In Marvel's The Falcon and the Winter Soldier series, there is this side storyline where Falcon finds out that the U.S. government had performed experiments on Black soldiers telling them that they were getting tetanus shots when they were really getting experimental version of the super soldier serum. The serum had killed a lot of the test subjects. And the government wanted to kill the survivors in order to cover up the experiments. I know my nephew has been watching the show so I can't wait to tell him about how that storyline was based on the Tuskegee Experiment and relate that to modern day COVID vax hesitancy.</p>

        <p>I heard the phrase in a lecture about three different kinds of doubt by Dr. Habermas.</p>
<p>Essentially volitional doubt is the case that a person simply willfully refuses to believe in a thing no matter the evidence presented.  They are willfully doubtful of a concept.</p>

<p>I thought I've heard that about the methods used by KGB, abot how if you press down hard enough, people will not be able to think differently, no matter the evidence</p>

        <p>Because the generation didn't grow up to think for themselves, they grew up being told how to interpret those stories. And they have been told that what dystopia looks like is a mean orange man saying dumb shit on Twitter, or violent criminals being lawfully arrested, rather than making leaving your own home a crime.</p>
