    <strong>Have you already, or do you have plans on moving someplace less restrictive?</strong>
    <p><p>I currently live in one of the more restrictive states in the most restrictive county and have been considering moving elsewhere or at least taking a vacation there. I've heard about many people are escaping their California in large part because of the how the gov't has handled the pandemic. If you've been to both a highly restrictive and not-so restrictive state or municipality, what was the contrast like?</p></p>

        <p>Yeah 
I’m in Pa. Ironically enough, I was in Florida when all this started, moved back to Pa in March because I lost my job, have family here , and was genuinely scared (this whole “pandemic” has really, really woken me up to how toxic CNN and the mainstream news is). As soon as I’ve saved enough , I’m heading back to Florida. I really shouldn’t have left .</p>

        <p>I stayed in state but moved from the middle of a large city to more than 50 miles from the closest large city.  The biggest contrasts I have seen are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the city, people will look away if you even say hi to them.  Here people are having conversations and laughing in public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Store employees are way more friendly here, similar to 2019 levels.  They will make small talk and ask if they can help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People here still shake hands and hold doors open for other people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the city all buildings had giant signs saying MASKS REQUIRED, and they did enforce them.  Here the majority of buildings don't have mask signs or just say 'masks recommended' and even those don't really care.  For example: mask wearing is about 70% in Walmart here versus 99.5% in the city. (Our state supposedly requires masks everywhere inside.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>City buildings had 6 foot markings everywhere.  I've only seen them once here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I haven't heard anyone mention the word coronavirus here.  It doesn't even come up in conversation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I am really happy with my move.  It's pretty much like going back to February.</p>

        <p>I am considering moving to a less restrictive state. But I am also told there is a chance Biden might make mandates national, so I’m not sure what to do in the meantime.</p>

        <p>damn, that sounds blissful to me! I'm stuck in a small ass apartment in oregon. Our governor issued a statewide freeze and our county is going to be in lockdown for 4 weeks minimum. Just when I thought life was gradually returning to normal. BAM. We're about to enter lockdown 2.0. I had just joined a gym and my depression, laziness, desire to binge drink, all dissipated after my first workout. It was orgasmic! I guess it's back to withering away. Or I may just take a long vacation elsewhere where I can be freer.</p>
