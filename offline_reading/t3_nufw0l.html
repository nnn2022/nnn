    <strong>I feel like I’m going to die here, alone, with no one here to really love me</strong>
    <p><p>I’m going crazy! My parents are crazy people! I want to see my girlfriend again! Its been over 4 months since I have even SEEN her, and over a YEAR since I really got to spend any real time with her! I wanna go to my usual hangout place (as I’m in California, I loved going to the Americana and the Galleria. I know everyone has issues with California, but normally, I really love it here, so much to do when we aren’t in a f***kin cage) I wanna use my Disneyland or Universal annual pass to just go to a Theme Park randomly on a Friday and enjoy life! I wanna go to a convention and meet new friends again and sing karaoke and dress up and buy cool things. I wanna make memories again but what am I going to remember?! My parents hate me and see me as a failure, and I’m never allowed to get away from them anymore, even just to go out to eat somewhere fun. I’m scared that this is going to be my new life and It makes me wanna just curl up in bed and stop moving. I miss my life. I do LOVE Video games, but I also LOVE going out and enjoying my life. My birthday is coming up in October. Knowing how sad my birthday was last year, and the fact that this is going to be my 21st birthday, I really hate how everything is looking. I just don’t wanna be here anymore!</p></p>

        <p>You're 20 years old, so move out. Get a job if you don't have one (there are a lot of places hiring), and get a place with lots of roommates so you can afford it. Get involved in the freedom community. Peggy Hall of The Healthy American is in Orange County, so you could start your search for community with her organization.</p>

        <p>Sounds like a toxic situation. How are your finances? I'd definitely move out of California, go to college or work somewhere in an open state like Florida or Texas if you can. There are plenty of opportunities, and likely far cheaper cost of living than wherever you are in CA, not to mention many theme parks that are actually open. Tell your parents you are an adult who can make your own choices, if you want to leave the house and go somewhere it's your choice, not theirs. Especially if you want to see your gf.</p>

        <p>Best advice I can give you is, grab your girlfriend and move to Texas. And don’t even think about voting Democrat when you get here. It may not be quite what you’re used to, but we have fun restaurants and stuff to buy and everything you’re missing too.</p>
<p>“I’m scared this is going to be my new life.” Hate to break it to you, but it already is. We all know this isn’t liable to end soon in that state. And when it does, they’ll come up with some other “crisis”. Even if it means uprooting your entire life, please, please get out of there. That’s the only way you get your quality of life back.</p>

        <p>It sounds like more of your issues have to do with your living situation with your parents than anything else. California is stricter than other states but still allows for a lot of freedom and social interaction. Are you able to move out?</p>

        <p>The Disneyland thing is more of a creature comfort. I was really upset when I wrote this, I will say this in response to all the comments about moving out. I’m planning to, but due to an awful awful case of anxiety, its hard for me to actively work up the courage to just up and leave. Ive planned it out, and I know my breaking point, But something more metal is holding me back. Its a pain and I hate it. Before 2020 I was trying to help myself. I was gonna finally start building my life. I was gonna get a job, then move in with my Girlfriend of almost 6 years. Then the lockdowns hit, and my life was put on hold for over a year. I’m planning to get a job as soon as possible, and to submit my portfolio to the Pasadena Art Center, so I really am trying to get my life together, its just taking longer then I though.  Sorry about the childishness of the above post, complaining about Disneyland and Conventions... I just was emotional when I wrote that and had to get that off my chest. Thank you all for understanding, and for all the kind words</p>

<p>So "what you are allowed/able to do" is not a result of the pandemic. It is a result of your government's chosen response.</p>
