    <strong>The most frustrating part of all of this, in my opinion. Also, a shoutout to my grandmother.</strong>
    <p><p>TLDR: States/cities dangling the carrot in front of the faces of their citizens. Meaning, making a mask mandate that expires on <em>x</em> date, but repeatedly extending the mandate for another month or two. Over and over and over. Or governors making masks optional, but many mayors and businesses still opting to make it mandatory.</p>
<ul>
<li>So I've heavily been looking at moving from Maine to escape our mask mandates (mandatory for the entire state everywhere inside and outside, regardless of distancing capabilities, as of Nov. 4), amongst many other reasons. I'll probably make a post sometime soon about my experiences and information regarding trying to find a new place to live, but for now, I wanted to share a frustration I've had.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, what's been killing me as I research states and cities to move to is how it seems most places are constantly just dangling the carrot in front of the face of it's citizens. For example, many states' governors have made wearing a mask optional, and left the decision up to the mayors of their cities. So many times you'll heard about a state that doesn't require masks, but it's only halfway true, since almost every even halfway large city will still require them. Plus, that also doesn't include all the business that independently choose to make mask-wearing mandatory to enter their business.</p>
<p>For example, Florida is typically now viewed as open and not requiring masks. But unless you want to move to a city of, say, less than 50k residents, you're still going to have to wear a mask in most cities and deal with plenty of restrictions. This is the case in many other states that I've been looking at as well, that are also being touted as fairly open (relative to other states, that is).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Another example of dangling the carrot is states/cities that implement a mask mandate until <em>x</em> date. Then that <em>x</em> date starts to come around, and the government extends the mask mandate to <em>y</em> date, a month or two down the road. And keep doing this, over and over and over again. "Cmon everyone, not much further to go, just a little longer! ... Oh, nevermind, just a liiiittle longer guys!" Which is pretty much the scenario we've all been going through ever since this all started.</p>
</li>

<p>While I'm here, shoutout to my nearly 80 year old grandmother. She's incredibly active in her town, and is involved in many of the events and activities that occur, but refuses to ever wear a mask anywhere she goes. If she's forced to wear one to enter someplace, she won't go in. And with Maine recently enacting a mandate that forces everyone in the state to wear a mask anywhere and everywhere they go, she still holds strong to her disdain of masks and will not conform.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An uncle recently mentioned that she should really be more careful about it all, but I disagreed. It's her choice, firstly. Secondly, she's elderly and doesn't have <em>that</em> many days remaining. Let her live out her life how she pleases. Sure, she's nearly 80 and her side of the family has some heart issues, but she's very in-shape and excercises regularly. Odds are, she won't even catch it. And on the off-chance she does, there's a very slim chance she'll die. And that slim chance is further slimmed by the fact that the 70+ bracket for the virus' death rate is heavily influenced by those that are very, very old, have severe underlying conditions, and/or who are already sick/on their death beds. That's also disregarding how the numbers are fudged a bit, since death by <em>x</em> condition is often technically counted as a "Covid death". So keep kicking ass and "killing grandmas", grandma!</p></p>
