    <strong>CNN Reporter Tried to Sic the Police on FL Super Bowl Watchers for Not Wearing Masks - Ho Hum</strong>
    <p><p>Apparently CNN reporter Randi Kaye hasn't been to Florida very much because she whined all night about people not wearing masks and was surprised (gasp!) and frustrated (aww poor girl) that the police didn't do anything about it (because the police here are MAGA).</p>
<p>News Flash Randi, most of us do NOT wear masks in Florida and guess what? People are not dying in the suburbs like you and ol Joe claim.</p>
<p>The video within the article is hiliarious to watch - <strong>Randi is double-masked and literally SURROUNDED by 1000's of people all having fun WITHOUT masks</strong>. She's having a hissy hit and the CNN anchor is shocked at the 'disturbing images on the screen' but what CNN doesn't realize is the joke's on them - <strong>by showing people in Florida living life without masks they are showing their viewers that everything CNN says is a lie</strong>. People in Florida have been living like this since June of last year and Florida is thriving. #WakeUpAmerica and see the truth. </p>
<p>Take the #fakenews back with you when you leave.</p>
<p>#FloridaIsFREE</p>
<p>Edit: added section about video - after watching it again because it's so amusing</p>

        <p>This 'reporter' is the epitome of a 'snowflake' and I hate to use that latter term in quotes.</p>
<p>She forgot which state she is in. Florida, the land of the TRULY free, where CoVid-19 is not killing people left and right but actually LESS than in other states and MAINLY those with numerous other health issues who were always going to be in danger from this seasonal flu.</p>

        <p>For as much as these "listen to the science" these people are....they sure as fuck don't look at the scientific numbers showing that FL that has been open the whole time has less deaths per 100k people than CA does and they've been closed the whole time.</p>

        <p>Hahahahaha!!! Good thing she had a double mask to protect all those others, right? That’s the line “my mask protects you?” and hope CNN viewers think long and hard about it.</p>
