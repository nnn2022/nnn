    <strong>What is real, neo?</strong>
    <p><p>We've seen it in marketing for the last hundred years at least.. lies first accountability only when absolutely cornered. If you say it long enough people will believe it: diamonds are forever <em>only thats like a super recent trend if you look into it... ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/02/how-an-ad-campaign-invented-the-diamond-engagement-ring/385376/
 Cigarettes won't kill you slow and painfully..https://www.history.com/news/cigarette-ads-doctors-smoking-endorsement cannabis will.. radium..https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/03/how-we-realized-putting-radium-in-everything-was-not-the-answer/273780/
Yada yada.. for example..
Now we've still got sodium fluoride in tap water.. which is a bitch of a subject but according to the official consensus: https://www.espimetals.com/index.php/msds/720-Sodium%20Fluoride
It's toxic in the way that it accumulates over time so brushing your teeth with it twice a day is questionable tho I mean to say that's my non medical opinion of course.. 
We've all heard the lawyers rounding up victims on late night tv for recalled medicines https://prescriptiondrugs.procon.org/fda-approved-prescription-drugs-later-pulled-from-the-market/
 that have met every established criteria for "SAFE" in this country (USA still american still believe in freedom god-damn-it) 
And while I'm at it our president obviously has dementia https://youtu.be/aOsEHBc2nTM or some other debilitating mental disease past the point of reason. Does anyone believe this guy is fit to play a match of chess anymore? This is truly insane is it not? I'm about done with this rant but seriously I fucking love and believe in any one of you who has the courage to demand some reasonable answers right now.. </em>As much love as these cold digital characters can carry.</p></p>
