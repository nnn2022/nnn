    <strong>They say: if you don't wear a mask, the hospitals are going to be overfilled.</strong>
    <p><p>The truth: people who don't wear masks don't go to the hospital because they rely on their immune system to heal them completely.</p>
<p>The immune system is a perfect mechanism.</p>
<p>You can inhale cigarette smoke that contains more than 70 carcinogenic compounds, for 50 years in a row, and still live up to 90.</p>
<p>You can inhale polonium 210 (a radioactive compound in cigarettes) for 20 times a day, 50 years in a row. </p>
<p>Plus pollution, lack of exercise, eating shit all the time. </p>
<p>Our body is the most complex and perfect machine of the universe as well know it. It can fight anything and survive all kinds of abuses.</p>
<p>So going back to the initial topic, who is filling up places and beds? (and I quote a friend of mine who is a doctor and currently working in a hospital) </p>
<p>People who are terrified of the virus, who are perfectly healthy and yet they demand a place in the hospital at any costs. </p>
<p>People who are scared up to the moon, and think that they are going to die.</p>
<p>Who is filling up all the beds?</p>
<p>The crazy wackos who can believe the immune system can do its job and don't need no hospital?</p>
<p>Or the scared shitless healthy people who get a small cough and think they're going to die?</p>
<p>Who is filling up all the hospitals?</p></p>

        <p>In Ontario, most people wore them, and they still claim that the ICUs in the Toronto area are full.</p>
<p>I think they probably are full, but I also think that masks won't do a darn thing about that.</p>

        <p>LA is out of ICU beds and almost out of Oxygen supplies and might have to start rationing care. Do you think the people who died or are dying aren't real? Was the shortage of ventilators that are needed to help these people breathe while in the hospital fake? Were the trucks of dead bodies outside my home in NYC not real?</p>
<p>Are you that selfish that even if the mask has a possibility of helping to stop this its just too much for you to place a piece of fabric over your face while around other people?</p>
<p>What happened with the people who died from covid's immune systems why didn't the perfect system fix it? Should we just do nothing and let it solve itself by killing many more people? </p>
<p>Because they cant tell you this 100% works on something that is new and we are still researching and learning about, you choose to do nothing, instead of possibly trying to help your fellow man with something as simple as a mask. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Actually its worse than doing nothing. </p>
<p>This is horrendous, you should be ashamed.</p>

        <p>Actually, they aren't out of beds. That's a lie.</p>
<p>Vents also never had a shortage.</p>
<p>NYC gets overwhelmed in bad flu years, maybe they should prepare for those too, but they never do. Did you complain about it 2 years ago?</p>
<p>You swallowed the lie willingly, step back, look at the evidence, and make your decisions</p>

        <p>That’s no true though is it. Many people’s immune systems betray them. Ask anyone with an immune disorder. Someone with severe asthma, lupus, cystic fibrosis, cancer are you saying it’s their fault? Plenty of anti maskers and covid deniers have ended up in the hospital, some even dying.

<p>I mean you can't just go around living in a bubble of lies, running around breaking laws because they don't apply to you. Lol.

        <p>actually no, it is what is happening in italy.</p>
<p>Many healthy people who are scared they are going to die because they have a runny nose (and hey, it is winter time) are overfilling the hospitals, and if all this fear propaganda didnt been exist, this wouldnt have happened.</p>
<p>In a situation of danger, the government and the doctors would do everything in their powers to make you calm down. Like when you have cancer, doctors try everything they can to make you aware of the risks, but also try everything they can to give you a positive outlook and that you can do this and overcome this.</p>
<p>They are doing the complete opposite of this, trying to scare people to death.</p>
<p>The immune system is not a lie, it is not a conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>And there is tons of proof to confirm this claim.</p>
<p>More than there is on the proof that the vaccine will protect you. There is still no proof that the vaccine will 100% protect you. There is no proof that the mask will 100% protect you.</p>
