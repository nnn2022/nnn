    <strong>I am now a single issue voter.</strong>
    <p><p>I love Trump but if Biden came out and said “no more masks, it’s all bullshit” he would have my vote. I think Trump is our best chance at returning to any sense of “normal”. I am so sick of this shit it’s driving me crazy. As you all know the CDC released the real death from just China flu. When will the candidates start using that talking point?</p></p>

        <p>I heavily dislike trump and biden. I agree with more of bidens policies, but the thing is, with trump we are much more likely to return to normal. So I would like to vote for trump. It's sad that both candidates have so many flaws</p>

        <p>I agree. I think democrats are acting like mask Nazis because they think it’s anti trump. They don’t realize how many people would be on their side if they didn’t do that. Twitter is not the American voter. Even Reddit users who I used to respect have become these mask virtue signaling Nazis. They treat anti mask wearers like MLM salespeople and antivax. It’s really astonishing how much power the media has.</p>

        <p>Agree on all points. Biden is so lousy, what a lame candidate. But I would have happily held my nose and voted blue if the dems hadn’t <em>lost their freaking minds</em> over covid and throw freedom (omg, don’t call it “muh freedumbs” - do we say that about civil rights, women’s suffrage, the first amendment, reproductive rights?!?!) out the window in deference to absolute witless hysteria! Now who freaking knows when I’ll vote blue again. Talk about a bad taste in your mouth.</p>

        <p>Someone on here posted an idea that I liked about masks. For the times that you are feeling non-confrontational but still dont want to wear your mask (like me—I want to stand up for what is right and set a good example by not wearing my mask. But I have witnessed a pro-masker incident that was so ridiculous I don’t want to risk seeing or experiencing another knock down, drag out fight)</p>
<p>What the suggestion was, is to carry a surgical mask in your pocket or purse w/ a broken strap. Then, if you get hassled, take it out and show the person and say “sorry dude, my mask broke.” </p>
<p>Seems like a legit way to go maskless while not inciting mask-related violence.</p>

        <p>Welcome to politics. Trump can’t come out and say that or he’ll be accused of downplaying the virus. Biden can’t say it because it will show we did all this for nothing. It’s a weird game of chicken going on but in reality, Trump will likely be the one to help us return to normal. </p>
<p>This is a golden opportunity for the democrats and the left to take advantage of a situation and impose their agenda, which they said they should do. My bet is on Trump to get rid of this nonsense if he wins.</p>

Fauci and Birx, ya fired. 
States: open schools or forgo federal funding.

        <p>It seemed to me that all the democrats in the primary said whatever they thought the voters want. I think they got a lot wrong. They focused on superficial things, like identity politics. The economy and jobs would be better. Biden seems the most vacuous of all the candidates on that side. </p>
<p>I’ve been voting blue my whole life. I am terribly torn on the presidential vote. I want to call all the candidates in local races and make it specifically about the lockdown.</p>

        <p>&rt; Do you think if Trump wins (a huuuge “if” at this point, honestly) that the next day he’s gonna be like “fuck this shit, this is OVER. Fauci and Birx, ya fired. States: open schools or forgo federal funding. Businesses: we are offering covid lawsuit immunity to you so OPEN UP. And some serious phone calls to state governors like MI, IL, CA, NY about human rights violations and constitutional violations in theirs states.</p>
<p>That seriously gave me a hard on.  That would be just about the coolest thing ever.</p>

        <p>No idea what happens if Biden wins. If Trump wins, won’t the democratic governors still keep it locked down? I guess the republicans will lockdown the federal funds and states will be forced to open for survival? You would think they already considered that months ago.</p>

        <p>One thing that just astounded me was how bipartisan this whole issue became. Maybe it’s stereotyped as left vs right, but there are a lot of leftists on here, and my fellow conservatives have pretty badly disappointed me throughout all this. Many are willing to challenge the lockdowns but not much else. Maybe the unifying thread is libertarianism?</p>

        <p>I’m baffled, from a purely strategy angle, why trump has waited SO LONG to be forceful about how all this is BS. He was never going to “out hysteria” dems and Biden around covid. Why didn’t he lean into the freedom/sanity camp harder and sooner? Was he worried about losing elderly votes? </p>
<p>Plus he wanted to lock down NY and CT in the very beginning, but the states shot him down (as well they should have, constitutionally, but of course they went on to do much worse). </p>
<p>I’m voting against Biden. Not necessarily FOR Trump. He makes me very nervous, because he’s impulsive and unpredictable. He’s finally saying we need to open up, that covid isn’t the end of the world, that herd immunity is freaking real, etc... but it’s so little, so late in the game. I don’t feel ecstatic about the vote, even as a single issue vote.</p>

        <p>I understand your frustration but why throw your vote away during such an important election?   Trump has been outspoken against lockdowns.  We live in a country where states act somewhat autonomously and that’s a good thing.  It would have been disturbing if trump interfered at a state level like you wish.  I would have liked to see more talk on withholding federal aid unless they opened up but I don’t think there was.</p>

        <p>One of the federal government's primary jobs is to uphold the constitution. That includes if states are blatantly violating it. I believe states should have a level of autonomy too, but when you have places like California, New York, Pennsylvania, and Michigan ripping up the constitution and burning it, the feds must step in.</p>
<p>Trump has been outspoken against lockdowns, but what has he really done? It would be nice if he withheld funding for states that refuse to open, but considering he wants another stimulus bill I don't think that's going to happen. </p>
<p>Also, voting third party isn't throwing a vote away. I'm supporting the candidate that I believe in, even if they don't have a chance in winning. I couldn't respect myself if I didn't vote for the people I actually believe in, and instead voted for red team or blue team. To me throwing a vote away is being a Bernie Sanders supporter, knowing the DNC screwed him over, and voting for Joe Biden because "we just have to get Trump out of office." That's just voting for the negative. That's a wasted vote.</p>

        <p>I don’t know man, I feel like if lockdowns are an important topic for you then knowing that trump wants those to end and joe wants more extreme measures should be enough for you to realize you are voting for more than the lesser of two evils.  </p>

        <p>I feel the exact same way. Both sides suck and I hate how there’s so much division over who is “good.” My family acts like trump and all the republicans are going to save the day. When I question why they put so much faith in these people they get defensive and claim I don’t know enough. It’s so fucking exhausting.</p>

        <p>Same here, for this election. I'm voting Trump because he seems to be the better choice for ending the lockdowns.</p>
<p>I was a Democrat before coronavirus. Now though... seeing that they are pushing this lie that lockdowns are necessary... I honestly don't trust them at all anymore. I dont know where I fall politically anymore. Can I trust any of these politicians anymore? It doesn't feel like it... I've lost all faith in any form of government to be honest... same with media, I've lost faith in any news reporting. Now that I see the bs they have spun about covid, I question every news article I come across. Sigh.</p>

        <p>I see it as more strategic than that. I don't think Trump is going to save the day or anything. I think we are going to be in a similar situation come November 4th if he wins that we are in today. </p>
<p>Voting for Trump is just the beginning of our fight, just something we should do because it keeps Scott Atlas and herd immunity in play.</p>
<p>The way I see it is this, the Dems and the left have spent the last 4 years telling us that this guy is a racist monster, they've compared to him to Hitler, Mussolini, etc. Literally everything short of calling him the devil and then they tell us "hey, you better vote for Joe, because the world will end if Trump gets reelected" while simultaneously telling us "the world you knew and loved is gone, this is the new normal, get used to it and do what we say". So what's the logical person to do even if Trump never came out against lockdown and herd immunity was never discussed? </p>
<p>Well, the Dems and the left think they can have their cake and eat it too. They can't. If they think "OMG Drumpf gonna end it all" I say, yep and I'll be smiling as it burns. </p>
<p>They have convinced themselves they hold the moral high ground, always, and so we will always be portrayed as the villain. I say, let's give em what they really want. </p>
<p>I say vote for the candidate they hail as the most destructive and for President, that is Trump... But it doesn't stop there, I, a lifelong Democrat voter plan to vote Red down the whole ticket... Not because I agree with a bulk of their policies, but because the Republicans aren't scared crybullys and this is a war, not a battle.</p>

        <p>I agree. I’m pretty liberal on social issues and fiscally conservative. These mask mandates Trump everything in my book! I hope he comes out and abolishes face diapers in public’s places once and for all. This shouldn’t even be a political issue but democrats have made it that way. Even watching the townhall it was disgusting how they went out of their way to tell us how “socially distant” they are and everyone is FORCED to wear a face diaper. I’m fucking over it!</p>

        <p>So yesterday I was driving home from work and passed through a busy 4-lane intersection.  On one corner was a group of six Trump supporters—waving flags, jumping around, smiling, laughing, talking to each other...just looking hopeful, excited and happy.</p>
<p>On the opposite side of the intersection was one solitary older guy, slowly waving a Biden/Harris flag, his face obscured by a blue surgical mask despite being all alone, outside.</p>
<p>Um....yes.  This is why as a lifelong Democrat...I voted STRAIGHT republican.  Including Trump. 😳</p>

        <p>Yeah the candidate choices are definitely both pretty gnarly in their own ways, but this year, the very most important thing for me is lockdowns and masks. Hands down. I will be votong Trump</p>

        <p>I used to hate Trump. I knew the Russia thing was fake from the get go and the impeachment try was a scam...but still I didn't like the guy. Just felt like he was an bumbling idiot...</p>
<p>Then I started to watch the covid press breifings. I was so used to heating Trump clips on MSM and having them tell me what he's saying.</p>
<p>Listening to him live with full context, I was like..Hmm, this is pretty fair and spot on.</p>
<p>Then I went on to CNN to see what they were saying about what I just heard. I couldn't believe their takes. All focus on semantics and made up controversy. </p>
<p>I started to question what else had been like this. So I looked back and watched actual full press conferences and thought...wow, they are definitely sabotaging this guy </p>
<p>That is how I woke up</p>

        <p>I was originally a Democrat, but I will be voting all Republican this year. The lockdowns affect so many parts of our lives including employment, healthcare, and education. The turning point for me was when the Democrats hypocritically supported BLM protests despite the lack of social distancing. The strict lockdowns and authoritarian style of the Democratic governors also turned me off. They played politics with which businesses could stay open and which ones had to shut down. The Republican governors approached this with much more common sense.</p>
