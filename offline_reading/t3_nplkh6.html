        <p>Yup, 4G that causes infertility in mice has nothing to do with it. Various chemicals that cause infertility, that have been added as preservatives, packaging material or insecticide/pesticides, has nothing to do with it. Heck soy latte and mcdonalnd food has nothing to do with it. It's the damn sun.</p>

<p>how weird, the same eugenicists like bill gates are behind the man-made negative co-2 based climate change hoax agenda and the fakedemic of viruses without isolation and tests....</p>
<p>almost if it is a decades long AT LEAST interwoven agenda, that comes from many direction and tries to target the same goals.....</p>

        <p>&rt;but Climate Change</p>
<p>skeptical about climate change?</p>
<p>i am not skeptical, that climate change exists. of course climate change eixsts...</p>
<p>what i  am skeptical about is the idea, that man made co2 is increase the world's temperature by a significant factor.</p>
<p>what i'm skeptical about is the claim, that said theoretical climate change would be absolutely negative.</p>
<p>what i'm against are horror scenarios, that are made up by propaganda pieces of sh1t like al gore or bill i paralyze 490000 children in india for fun.</p>
<p>i am also against the use of said made up horror scenarios against the public to push criminal increases in living costs through co2 "taxes", reducing your freedom of movement through travel restrictions, ban of combustion engine cars, etc... etc...</p>
<p>what i am also against is geo engineering by spraying poison in the sky under the claim to "fight man made co-2 based, negative climate change"</p>
<p><a href="https://www.westernjournal.com/bill-gates-savior-complex-spirals-control-funds-sun-dimming-plan-save-human-race/">https://www.westernjournal.com/bill-gates-savior-complex-spirals-control-funds-sun-dimming-plan-save-human-race/</a></p>
<p>this is of course just the official spin of trying to get chemtrails more mainstream i guess.</p>
<p>have you even done any bit of research on that topic, or are you just going with what everyone around you believes?</p>
<p>did you know, that they have made insane bullshit predictions  for decades and decades?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCvVPPO1rnE&amp;list=PL25om63gd1VoP7m5VLuVcLOwKh-FB7Rxp&amp;index=10">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCvVPPO1rnE&amp;list=PL25om63gd1VoP7m5VLuVcLOwKh-FB7Rxp&amp;index=10</a></p>
<p>according to said predictions we are all frozen to death and  died of starvation in desert heat too.... those were the insane bullshit predictions for 2020 and earlier by the mafia behind this all.</p>
<p>are you aware, that  they manipulated data and just removed the medieval warm period from the data?</p>
<p><a href="https://realclimatescience.com/2018/12/erasing-the-medieval-warm-period/">https://realclimatescience.com/2018/12/erasing-the-medieval-warm-period/</a></p>
<p>they had an issue, because of course during that time no one had internal combustion engines, so can't blame those and even worse during the medieval warm period general wealth was experiences as a less harsh winter meant it was easier to get through and there was more yield on the fields due to the longer warmer summers and autumns.</p>
<p>are you aware of that?</p>
<p>are you also aware, that in earth's history vastly higher co2 concentrations were a thing than today without any negative impact?</p>
<p>have you looked at how the sun cycles correlate with the climate on earth?</p>
<p>have you looked at the cult  deliberated created around this myth with millions and millions put forth by monsters like george soros?</p>
<p>truthstream media made a great documentary about this cult around the man made climate change myth:</p>
<p><a href="https://odysee.com/@DotConnectorReports:e/The-Myth-of-Extinction-(Rebellion)-2019-Full-Documentary:b">https://odysee.com/@DotConnectorReports:e/The-Myth-of-Extinction-(Rebellion)-2019-Full-Documentary:b</a> (mirror not by the original creators, original version on vimeo or bitchute and i can't link bitchute on censoreddit)</p>
<p>here is a link to the creators's website:</p>
<p><a href="http://truthstreammedia.com/2019/11/18/new-documentary-the-myth-of-extinction/">http://truthstreammedia.com/2019/11/18/new-documentary-the-myth-of-extinction/</a></p>
<p>so again, have you actually done research yourself into the topic and have you thought about why they are pushing this so much and why they want to ad more theft (taxation) onto your products, onto your energy consumption, why they want to restrict travel and demonize co2 production.</p>
<p>just take a big step back and think about these things and just look at the cult around the man made negative, climate change hoax.</p>

<p>Which horror scenarios for example?</p>
<p>I only know of one thing that is being used for geo engineering and that are salts to make rain.</p>
<p><a href="https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/western-journalism/">I don't want to attack your sources, but...</a></p>
<p><a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/04/23/fact-check-bill-gates-not-trying-block-suns-rays/7310134002/">And Bill Gates never said he wants to do that. He mentioned the possibility but no one says that they actually want that.</a></p>
<p>How is blocking sunrays a way of trying to get chemtrails, which chemicals are posinonous to us humans and block the sun?I don't know any at least.</p>
<p>On what topic?</p>
<p>You linked a youtube video instead of a scientific article, sorry, but I don't watch some youtube videos made by people with no scientific background.</p>
<p><a href="https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/real-climate-science/">Even if your website was credible</a>, it doesn't show us the supposed medieval warm period that was "apparently" ereased.</p>
<p>We know why the earth warmed in the past. No one says it's only because of fossil fuels or combustion engines.</p>
<p><a href="https://skepticalscience.com/co2-higher-in-past.htm">https://skepticalscience.com/co2-higher-in-past.htm</a></p>
<p><a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/blog/2949/why-milankovitch-orbital-cycles-cant-explain-earths-current-warming/">What you mention are the Milankovitch (Orbital) Cycles. They are, however, not the reason currently.</a></p>
<p>Do show me that cult, sounds interesting indeed.</p>
<p>That documentary says it's about Extinction Rebellion. It's an extremist group what can I say? And... Bitchute, really?</p>
<p>I've also never heard of that group before.</p>
<p>Well, CO2 has been proven multiple times that it causes a greenhouse effect. So too much CO2 = Too much Heat. Sounds pretty reesonable really.</p>

        <p>part 2:</p>
<p>you linked twice to a website called "mediabiasfactcheck"</p>
<p>the first one was about the western-journal article.</p>
<p>if you actually look at the article, rather than looking at some website trying to throw dirt at the website, that the article is put on, then you can see, that it is an open source journalism article, meaning, that you can look at references for lots of things said.</p>
<p>you don't have to trust westernjournal, because the article links to reuters propaganda:</p>
<p><a href="https://news.trust.org/item/20201218140025-po1gu">https://news.trust.org/item/20201218140025-po1gu</a></p>
<p>to nature:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07533-4">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07533-4</a></p>
<p>daily mail:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-7350713/Bill-Gates-wants-spray-millions-tonnes-dust-stratosphere-stop-global-warming.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-7350713/Bill-Gates-wants-spray-millions-tonnes-dust-stratosphere-stop-global-warming.html</a></p>
<p>and more.</p>
<p>if you don't like the website, then you can find mirrors of the same story written by other people on other websites, that talk about how bill gates wants to dimn t the sun like mr burns or some james bond super villain.</p>
<p>do u see how trust in the website doesn't matter in that regard? the same way as you don't have to trust me, because i provide references for everything i say/write.</p>
<p>the other link you put up was for the </p>
<p>you link to the same website in regards to realcimatescience</p>
<p>i linked the article on tony heller's website and the video.</p>
<p>HOWEVER we again don't have to trust tony heller, because both the video and article are referenced, so you can actually look up the articles in the video yourself or click on the references in the article.</p>
<p>and in regards to:</p>
<p>&rt;have you looked at how the sun cycles correlate with the climate on earth?</p>
<p>i was not refering to to the milankovitch cycles, but i was mostly refering to the sun's changing activity throughout long periods of time.</p>
<p>more sun spot activity more energy output from the sun.</p>
<p>crazy idea, that the giant star in the sky has anything to do with the climate of this earth, right? ;) (sarcasm)</p>
<p>&rt;Do show me that cult, sounds interesting indeed.</p>
<p>That documentary says it's about Extinction Rebellion. It's an extremist group what can I say? And... Bitchute, really?</p>
<p>I've also never heard of that group before.</p>
<p>do you have something against mostly freespeech platforms like bitchute now?</p>
<p>you do know, that youtube massively censors creators and search results right?</p>
<p>also that documentary is not just about extinction rebellion, but about the cult beyond just that group.</p>
<p>&rt;Well, CO2 has been proven multiple times that it causes a greenhouse effect. So too much CO2 = Too much Heat. Sounds pretty reesonable really.</p>
<p>in that one sentence you made tons of assumptions.</p>
<p>so too much co2=too much heat.</p>
<p>what is too much heat? the medieval warm period was beneficial for humanity.</p>
<p>how much of ALL of the co2 thrown into the air is coming from humanity? how much is coming from vulcanos or the oceans?</p>
<p>you got programmed to believe, that the amount of co2 created by humans has a major negative influence and you never sat down and asked the fundamental questions about the assumptions made and follow up assumptions.</p>
<p>without asking those question, you get children who religious believe into the insane predictions and then you can use those groups of people to create chaos or demand change like co2 "taxes", etc...</p>
<p>how right were the predictions of the past? well they were completely wrong as i already showed you:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCvVPPO1rnE&amp;list=PL25om63gd1VoP7m5VLuVcLOwKh-FB7Rxp&amp;index=11">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCvVPPO1rnE&amp;list=PL25om63gd1VoP7m5VLuVcLOwKh-FB7Rxp&amp;index=11</a></p>
<p>again you don't have to trust tony heller, as you can look up these articles yourself, that are shown in the video.</p>
<p>they have been crying wolf for decades and decades and when the predictions completely failed as always, they just changed the predictions and targeted a new demographic.</p>
<p>i took quite some effort writing these responses, so i hope, that you go over the references. especially the video going over the "fact checkers" by corbettreport.</p>

        <p>It's a trash website what can I say</p>
<p>That was an experiment to show possibilities. Not a statement that it has to be used</p>
<p><a href="https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/">Daily Mail is also trash</a></p>
<p>Here is a quote from the western journal: "Now, apparently, he wants to save us from the sun."This is just a blatant lie. So you can guess what kind of website this is yourself.</p>
<p>Uh, no. The video doesn't link any article or study.</p>
<p>Oh you ment the suns activity. Okay. <a href="https://skepticalscience.com/acrim-pmod-sun-getting-hotter.htm">Well, the sun is actually having less activity currently</a> than the last couple years. So that doesn't quite work out.</p>
<p>Most of the time when I see Bitchute I think of right wing extremism and conspiracy theories and I was proven right on the second account.</p>
<p>YouTube has rules. It's that simple. But if that one guy you linked can upload, the other documentary could have been uploaded too no?</p>
<p>You use that word, cult, I don't think you know what it means.</p>
<p>Can you send me some graphs on the medieval warm period? Couldn't find anything. Too much heat is never good for humans.</p>
<p><a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2915/the-atmosphere-getting-a-handle-on-carbon-dioxide/">"The concentration of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere is currently at  nearly 412 parts per million (ppm) and rising. This represents a 47  percent increase since the beginning of the Industrial Age, when the  concentration was near 280 ppm, and an 11 percent increase since 2000,  when it was near 370 ppm."</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/climate-qa/doesnt-carbon-dioxide-atmosphere-come-natural-sources">During all the ice ages that have occurred over at least the past million years, these opposing branches of the carbon cycle have kept the atmospheric carbon dioxide level at or below 300 parts per million (ppm). Today, that level is close to 410 ppm. Not only is this the highest carbon dioxide has been during all of human civilization, it has reached these levels virtually instantaneously in geologic time frames. During ice age cycles of the past, a change this large would likely have taken thousands of years to occur.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://whatsyourimpact.org/greenhouse-gases/carbon-dioxide-emissions">"A minor amount carbon dioxide is created by volcanic eruptions, which accounts for 0.03% of natural emissions."</a></p>
<p>It has. And it's been proven, again. In the 1800s already </p>

<p>those were part of one of the first articles i linked to you.</p>
<p>this proves, that you either AGAIN don't understand what is written on websites, or it shows, that you deliberately don't read websites linked to you, or it shows, that you are a paid troll.</p>
<p>either way, it certainly doesn't make any more sense talking to you, as you ignore the references linked to you anyways.</p>

        <p>So, just as the planet is injected with a poison that some people have suggested could make you infertile (in an attempt to depopulate the planet?) they conveniently now state there could be a “fertility crisis” that is caused by global warming.</p>
<p>If I was a sceptic I would think that they are already planting the seed (punny) and coming up with their excuses to explain the “vaccine” caused fertility crisis and to blame it on global warming.</p>
<p>They inject you, they make you infertile, then they blame YOU for it via global warming.</p>
