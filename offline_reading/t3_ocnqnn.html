        <p>Damn the snowflakes. Too many people act like they are victims of some sort. Please! They don't know what victim means. I won't go into it here, but I went through some serious shit in my life...the worse kind of shit. The kind I wouldn't even wish on my worst enemy. Which, I believe, is why I don't get butt hurt easily. I'm like, "yeah..I've had worse punches than that sweet cheeks".</p>

        <p>It‚Äôs the same mods on a lot of subs, and it generally has me curious to wether they get paid to do this. What small amount of power those little men wield is still too much. Seriously though fuck those subs I‚Äôm less pissed about being banned and more upset that I cannot delete subs from my popular feed and before you say it I tried the desktop browser and entered some subs into filtered subs and when I try to exclude them it says sorry something went wrong on our end.</p>

        <p>Everybody that has gotten, or does get, any ban from unrelated subs like that, please report each of them as harassment to the Reddit admins.</p>
<p>After reporting a couple, I think that most ways of reporting them <em>probably</em> simply go back to the offending sub mods.</p>
<p>The way to be sure that a harassment report goes to reddit admins seems to be ONLY by doing it exactly this way (I'm sorry if I'm mistaken here, but this is the best I've got so far):</p>
<p>Use a web browser and go to:   https://new.reddit.com/message/messages/</p>
<p>It's critical to use 'new.' rather than just 'www.' or 'old.' so that the "permalink" feature on the message(s) is available, so that that link can be pasted into the report form.</p>
<p>Find the offensive message and capture the "permalink" - there should be about half a dozen features under each message, "permalink" being one of them.  In android, it's captured with long click and select "copy link", in windows it's like r-click and select "copy link", so do whatever you need to do in your web browser to copy the "permalink" into the clipboard.</p>
<p>With that link in the clipboard, open a new tab and go to:  https://reddit.com/report  I think you can follow this link and get to the right place.</p>
<p>Select the choices "I want to report spam or abuse", "this is abusive or harassing", "it's targeted harassment", "At me", and then paste the link in the spot for link.  I don't see any need for "additional information", but you do you.  Just keep in mind you'd be taking up a person's time to read that and we're the good guys here.</p>
<p>This is long to describe, but it's pretty quick and easy to do.</p>
<p>You'll get a "Help Center Report" message confirmation.  That's how you know for sure it went to reddit administration, and definitely not back to the perpetrating sub.</p>
<p>But please don't make another post here about it.  There's been a whole fucking lot of them already.  We know.</p>

        <p>Anytime I try that link, in any browser (I tried 3 different ones), it says "www.new.reddit.com normally uses encryption to protect your information. When Google Chrome tried to connect to www.new.reddit.com this time, the website sent back unusual and incorrect credentials. This may happen when an attacker is trying to pretend to be www.new.reddit.com, or a Wi-Fi sign-in screen has interrupted the connection. Your information is still secure because Google Chrome stopped the connection before any data was exchanged.
You cannot visit www.new.reddit.com right now because the website uses HSTS. Network errors and attacks are usually temporary, so this page will probably work later."</p>

        <p>Ok. Got it to load. The one I sent you was just the one that kept coming up in one of the browsers. On Duck Duck go it kept loading a 401 error. I waited a couple of minutes, tried it again and it worked. Maybe there was just a temporary error. I know in one browser it kept automatically switching to "www". But I got the report sent in. We have a TON of daily newcomers. I doubt many are going to see this message. Hopefully it can be posted for all to see when they join. Pinned to top.</p>
