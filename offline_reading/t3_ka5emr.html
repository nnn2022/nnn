        <p>Dude, the Jews weren't even asked to wear masks during the holocaust. Grow up a little. My friend just went to a concert in Taiwan after they lifted a way stricter lockdown than what we've enacted. And the whole point... no active covid cases currently.</p>
<p>I thought this sub was about figuring out ways to return to the old way of life after defeating what is causing the crisis, not bitching about the things that would help.</p>
<p>If you feel so victimized by wearing a mask that you would equate it to being a Jew in Nazi Germany, you are a "normal" I hope we never return to.</p>

        <p>I have a feeling you’re preaching to the wrong choir on this one. This sub is teaming with Nazi-like comparisons. It’s unfortunate and tells me most of the visitors aren’t serious but are just people who would complain about anything.</p>

        <p>Thankful there are still reasonable people here. It's hard to have discussions when people are so starkly black and white and use insane hyperbole on subs like this. Feel like it denigrates their message. I'm not endorsing totalitarianism and sure as shit want to safe-guard what freedoms we have, but it feels like they don't understand the situation that we're in.</p>

        <p>Dude: The comparison is apt, especially since Fauci's own data says "Masks are dangerous!" from looking at the data from the 1918 flu outbreak, where wearing masks too much actually lead to bacterial pneumonia outbreaks that were the reason so many people ended up dying.</p>

        <p>I can totally see where you're coming from, but weren't masks a tool to allow society to return to semi-normal? We do have a pandemic in the works, and as much as I'd like to shirk the mask and go to a concert again, that seems reckless.</p>
<p>The king of Sweden just admitted this week that their herd immunity strategy has failed, and from what we've seen from other countries (and now LA) this isn't a virus we can allow to spread unchecked due to rapidly overflowing covid wards. </p>
<p>I want to return. I do not like the supposed changes, but they were never meant to be permanent. It's only extended due to this idea that we're all going to get it so may as well reopen. It's what led to my Dad and GF's uncle getting it. Dad is fine, uncle has permanent lung damage.</p>
<p>As an aside, why do surgeons wear masks if they are as dangerous as you say?</p>
