        <p>Very pertinent.</p>
<p>I'm always impressed at how whenever I look at the posts in NNN, the conversation seems to be at the same place as my conversations in real life.</p>
<p>I spent nearly two hours yesterday arguing with someone about how "they didn't do it right" and "that's why we now have more restrictions".  </p>
<p>I explained exactly like that.  They said the same thing about Communism.  </p>
<p>But the person I was speaking to didn't understand.  He wasn't very familiar with history.  I tried to teach him about history, but he sees that as an attack and gets defensive.  He doesn't understand why something like a Charter is of critical importance.</p>
<p>Normally, I wouldn't mind someone not understanding of disagreeing.  But when it comes after a year of this bullshit.  A year after telling this person exactly how this will go down, and how volatile a situation we're in, and seeing how it turns out I was exactly correct.  Instead of admitting that and asking how they can learn more and understand what's happening; no, they double down and call you an idiot and say, "oh well, it's because we didn't do it good enough."</p>
<p>Goddammit.  I have lost all patience for these people.  Read a history book.  Please.  I can't barely take it anymore.  It is ridiculous.</p>

        <p>It's hard being on the outside seeing it all play out with no power to do anything or even reach those affected. It made me realize this must be how families of cult victims feel. </p>
<p>I even went as far as researching how to speak to cult victims and what happens with them once they finally do get out. It's a difficult and heartbreaking process. They lose so much of themselves.</p>
<p>During my research I came across an advocacy group that claimed the best tool they had to reach individuals who were still ensnared in cult life was anonymously mailed postcards with simple messages to help gently nudge their minds. Apparently the mailings must be anonymous because once they realize the message is coming from "an outsider" that is against their cult family they would completely shutdown to the message.</p>

        <p>The internet trains us to believe we know who we are talking to. Just by our usernames you and I, 50% of the people on Reddit will automatically disregard what we have to say. Online we are all specters.  </p>
<p>The internet also trains us to be hostile and emotional toward the "enemy". You can use this to your advantage; if you can stay patient and kind and unemotional, why then you must not be "the enemy", otherwise you would be hopping and screaming.</p>

        <p>As someone who was raised in a religious cult until I was 8, (homeschooled, only allowed to socialize with the 2 other kids who were also members, etc, etc) I can say the amount of stuff that triggers me from these people is staggering. The isolating of children is by far the worse. My partners friend just had a baby, but were only allowing people to visit if they wore a mask. I honestly had a small breakdown over that because it brought up so much stuff from my childhood that did irreparable damage. And now I see it being played out in mass amounts of kids.</p>

        <p>Friend, I have news for you: both Democrats and Republicans are authoritarian.</p>
<p>It's not Republicans out there marching and chanting to Defund the Police. In fact, the Republican controlled legislature in my state just railroaded through a bill protecting police funding and creating new and harsher punishments for disobeying the police.</p>
<p>If you think Republicans = right-leaning Libertarians you are mistaken.</p>

        <p>They're naive and think humans will always comply if you can convince them it's in their best interests. </p>
<p>We're not a hive mind, any "solution" that requires 100% participation is not a solution. </p>
<p>What's even more frustrating is that in a capitalist society, groups have the option to live this way with like-minded people. There are "intentional communities" all over the United States, but these people aren't satisfied to live in their perceived utopia unless they can force others to do it too. It's very evangelical.</p>

        <p>It's not even good on paper. On paper it's inherently confiscatory and therefore evil.  That whole Dictatorship of the Proletariat thing which is part of "Communism on paper" involves the nationalization of people's private property. If you don't want to participate in this nationalization you typically end up dead or in a gulag. </p>
<p>I don't see theoretical Communism as any more benevolent than what actually happens when Communist revolutionaries take power in history.</p>

        <p>I think there'ssomethingin common with lockdowns and socialism: they both completely ignore human psychological needs and behavior. </p>
<p>Saying: "This pandemic would be over if  only people followed the rules" is the rwquivalend of saying you could fly if there was no gravity.  If you make rules that people don't follow en masse, it isn't their fault, it's yours for coming up with unsustainable policies.</p>

        <p>Their ideas are unfalsifiable. If they don't work, you must have done something wrong; no place for the idea that it doesn't work. I go outside and see everyone wearing masks; we still have plenty of cases, enough to impose an arbitrary and unconstitutional curfew. People don't wake up; they don't read, they don't reasearch, they don't question. They fear and obey</p>

        <p>There are several countries in Europe with "socialist" programs (like Medicare for All) that do work, and work extremely well. The idea of someone deciding to feed their kids vs. getting Cancer treatment is inhumane and unheard of in many countries, but here in America, that's the American dream apparently.</p>

        <p>To be fair Marx communist ideal isn’t/wasn’t achievable even if desired with the tools we have/had. Communism may work if an algorithm is the dear leader and human greed has been taken out of the equation. What we had wasn’t real communism it was state capitalism. Since Marx utopia has no currency or concept of private ownership. And all communist regimes had limited private ownership of goods and services.</p>

        <p>I think both, that I misunderstood the term, but that "left" and "right" are identities that we carry.</p>
<p>Think about it - neither you nor I have ever ran for office as a party member, yet for some reason it's likely that we identify with a party (if you live in the US). We think of ourselves as "a Democrat" or "a Republican" even though we've never been a member of those parties e.g. gotten their support in running for office.</p>
