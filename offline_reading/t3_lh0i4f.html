<p>Welcome back to the edition where I try my damnedest to be civil in light of everything. Then provide my own case anyways, assuming someone will eventually take notice.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.commondreams.org/views/2021/01/14/insurrection-pandemic-and-censorship">https://www.commondreams.org/views/2021/01/14/insurrection-pandemic-and-censorship</a></p>
<p>About the source:</p>
<p>Common dreams has been going since 1997, independently creating articles on social justice, equality, etc. but not in the typical political way. The authors are funded by donations and typically work to spread news on how civil rights are working in whatever time we find ourselves in. Richard Heinberg comes from the post carbon institute, usually dedicated to writing articles and books on how to adapt to clean energy, but here he voices a rather candid opinion on where social media has gone.</p>
<p>And here’s my opinion, a long one:</p>
<p>I’m glad I found this article to demonstrate the way I felt about all this. Look, when I came to NNN, it’s as the title of the sub suggested, I’m against the idea of recontextualizing humanity’s progression on the notion of avoiding any and all harm and staying out of the way of politics. I was willing to understand that people would spend a good chunk in isolation before the government shapes up a much more effective plan for how life can carry on, but they haven’t, and outside independently operating governors, they wouldn’t. In fact, there’s a lot of news not reaching the public due to censorship. You can’t just ban people and remove their voices from the wider world because they asked a question.</p>
<p>There’s a certain point where people lose faith and trust in the greater powers controlling society. When they learn about suffering and abuse and lies based not off what they’re told, but what they’ve seen on their own. Memories of what they learned in the past being discarded to fit the new narrative. Being told they are utterly powerless. That’s why I’m in this sub. I’m not a QAnon, don’t know what that even means yet, I’m not a conservative, or republican, democrat, liberal, or whatever in between, I usually am not an anti-vaxxer, though given the current circumstances I’m not so sure anymore, I’m here so that my voice can be heard and that these different perspectives and data points in these links can be seen and processed. If that means having to be lumped in as a terrorist and conspirist, please, I’ve been treated as much worse.</p>
<p>There are so many angles to the current state of the world going unnoticed and hidden away, yes, they all typically follow the goal of proving that the isolation, faulty health measures, propaganda, and business sabotage needs to end, but if you wanted information on how being completely alone makes you into a buddhist monk and achieve inner peace, or that getting the virus will kill 20 people around you, or that the virus actually can’t be stopped despite all the masks and restraining orders you impose upon yourself but you should keep doing it anyways, believe me, you’d find a supporting claim for that in a heart-beat. “The virus is deadly, here’s the numbers, we don’t have numbers on anything else. Just virus.” Try finding a browser that isn’t google, and type in a question like, “policies of foreign countries” added over the past year, or “social media censorship”, “[cause of death]s in [region] of [year/month]” or heck, look up the conditions of various people before they were taken by covid “and nothing else”. Is there information? Who is the source? What is their bias? What were they documenting years earlier in their career? Are they being paid?</p>
<p>That’s my agenda anyways, and trust me, I have, and will keep finding, more word on political abuse of rights, oppression, insanity, and even progress. Those stories deserve a broader voice, as with culture throughout history, everything deserves a say in the matter. Anyways, I gotta shape up the other past few days of me falling into a pit of despair over seeing people celebrate selfish introversion. Trust me, I’ve forced myself alone for the past 8 years and will continue to do so, it’s not exactly hard.</p></p>
