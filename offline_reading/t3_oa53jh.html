    <strong>Corona more Dangerous if you believe in it - German Study finds</strong>
    <p><p>A german Dating Portal just did a Study on whether Corona-"believers" and Corona-"deniers" are a good match. The almost 1.000 participants were categorized into 3 categories. One being Corona-"believers" who follow the rules closely and consider it dangerous. The second being Corona-"skeptics" who are inbetween. The third being Corona-"deniers" who dont believe in it and barely follow the rules.</p>
<p>Interrestingly the study accidently found that there seems to be a strong correlation between believing corona is dangerous / following the rules and actually getting Corona.</p>
<p><strong>"4 in 10 Corona-"Believers", but only 0.9 in 10 Corona-"Deniers" had severe or even deadly Covid-19 cases in their social cirlces.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Corona-"Skeptics" reported 2.5 in 10 cases."</strong></p>
<p>Isnt that wierd...</p>

        <p>Agreed. Yet, very interresting correlation if you ask me. Surely, it can be interpreted in a number of ways and sample-size was small. But, its kinda funny when these things come up that I already saw within my peers, were those scared of it all "got it" at some in point in time (i.e. cold/flu + positive tests) where as those not scared didnt get it at all so far.</p>

        <p>Not religious myself, but I wholeheartly agree. Be healthy in your mind and heart is the most important aspect of health/life in general.</p>
<p>Most of todays sciences are microscopic and lack the macroscopic perspective. By looking to close at something, we miss the bigger picture.</p>

        <p>Could be that the belivers have overall poorer health:  Obesity, health conditions, don't eat healthy or exercise.  They follow the rules because they don't believe they are in control of their lives and don't take personal responsibility for their health, or they just have the bad luck of having health conditions beyond their control like Lupus.</p>
<p>Or maybe the believers are in higher risk environments, like healthcare.  A lot of confounding variables.  But the people I've seen who aren't belivers tend to take better care of themselves.</p>

        <p>All cells must detox as we recycle millions of cells daily, or else the organism would die. There is no catching an illness other than one's own habits.</p>
<p>The immune system does not stop any invader--this idea is to make us think there is always a war going on. When in fact, our immune system's job is to remove trash from our body; when this can not happen--cancer and other conditions arise.</p>
<p>To have the idea of contagion, you must first ask where the first of each infectious organism came from.</p>
<p>You then realize you do not catch sickness--it is from what you eat (nutritional deficiency, toxicity), toxins (emf, injections, modern medicine), drink, think, and feel.</p>

        <p>Lanka is awesome.</p>
<p>Im no doctor, so I really dont care to read through all the scientific papers and check them for errors and what not. But, its really fascinating how many people consider our modern medicin to know it all, when everyone who ever went to a doctor knows that we are very, very far from truly understanding human biology and diseases.</p>
<p>Its a shame we still treat those challenging conventional wisdom like back in the dark ages.</p>

        <p>This seems like a mix-up of cause and effect.</p>
<p>As in:</p>
<p>Believing in covid doesn't magically make your relatives more susceptible. But having relatives being affected makes you believe in it.</p>

        <p>A possible explanation.</p>
<p>Issue with your interpretation is that it would assume that everyone is a disbeliever in the first place and/or that there is a mechanism that makes believers become unbeliever if no covid case happens.</p>
<p>This is absolutely not the case within my peers. There has been close to 0 shifts in how Corona is perceived within my 100+ peers. Small sample-size, but Ive yet to see the claim that either side knows of a mechanism to convince the other. However Ive seen many, many comments on how others are unconvicable.</p>
<p>Also, Ive been 100% correct in my predictions on who of my peers has had/will have had covid (only those who are considering it a dangerous disease). Which again, no proof, but to me its very fascinating.</p>

        <p>I have yet another explanation:</p>
<p>People who don't believe in Covid also won't get themselves PCR-tested.
Like I guess that I may have had slight symptoms of something respiratory-related in the past 1 1/2 years but I didn't care because it felt no different to the many times I had something like that before.</p>
<p>Then there's also the placebo/nocebo-effect or psychological impact in general. There has been experiements where the split a bunch of people into two groups and have them eat chocolate. To one of them they said: "We included something that prevents getting headaches" and to the other they said: "We are not sure about one of the ingredients and want to see whether the people eating it get a headache".
Just that made a massive difference in reported headaches.</p>
<p>Interesting. I have no idea what most of my peers actually think. A lot of them avoid this topic entirely and I suppose it is in order to prevent conflict about it from the possibility of having opposing views.</p>
<p>However, for one of the cases I know that there has been a shift from believer to doubter. I suppose my impact on that was rather small as we usually both avoided that topic as well. But we had a lot of meta-discussions about biases, so I suppose she was well aware about her biases and forced herself to consume information that went against it, in order to not have to consider herself as biased and close-minded, which would have been against her core-values.</p>

        <p>Those that got caught into the COVID hysteria tend to exaggerate the conditions of those they know had the disease. They do it to reinforce their beliefs, to act herculean, and to add drama in a world that is naturally boring to them. People tell me they know someone who got COVID and was on the brink of death, and then when I do a bit of investigation and specifically ask what their symptoms were, they're usually forced to say it was just a cough or a mild fever. Celebrities and athletes have done this a lot to get the spotlight.</p>
