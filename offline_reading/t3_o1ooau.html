        <p>I have no idea where you got that from. Nothing has ever said that and as far as I'm aware the data doesn't back that up so im guessing its more of a personal feeling. Still, it's understandable to have fears about symptoms. But if your interested (which you aren't I know) here is what I know.
The least gratifying but probably most true answer as to why many of us feel fairly awful after our second vaccine shot is that the vaccine is doing what it is supposed to do; jar the body into creating antibodies like it would do if you were getting sick.</p>
<p>Dr. Katelyn Jetelina offers a range of reasons for the responses — with a focus on women’s health — besides the “vaccines are working” reasoning, which she says is “the strongest hypothesis.” Other reasons might include:</p>
<p>Stress and anxiety related to COVID-19 or getting vaccinated may be also linked (although, hopefully, this is followed by relief!). I, personally, hate when people say “oh you’re just stressed”, but stress is linked to health. Science on the relationship between stress and menstrual cycles, specifically, is less clear though.</p>
<p>Body temperature or disrupted sleep. We know the vaccine causes quite a few other immune responses (i.e. side effects), including fever or body aches (causing lack of sleep). Body temperature and lack of sleep have been scientifically linked to changes in menstrual cycles. So, if people are having vaccine side effects, it wouldn’t be that unusual for some women to notice cycle changes too.</p>
<p>Among a small study of 177 patients, 25% had menstrual volume changes: 20% had a lighter-than-usual period and 19% had a longer-than-usual cycle. While it’s possible that the COVID-19 vaccine could have a similar effect, it’s not known at this time. There has been no biological mechanisms proposed that would directly link the vaccine to menstrual volume.</p>
<p>Could be random. Correlation does not indicate causation. Individually, it may be a sign that something else is going on that just coincidentally showed up after vaccination. On a population level, it may be due to something we call “recall bias”. Basically, in epidemiology we notice that when participants have an “event” they’re more likely to notice and report smaller details. We see this in cancer studies all the time. Cancer patients are more hyperaware of all the events leading up to cancer (because it’s a life altering diagnosis) compared to someone who never got cancer. So, people getting the vaccine could be hyperaware of changes compared to people that didn’t get the vaccine. This can cause a perceived imbalance.</p>
<p>And Dr. Jetelina offers some of what she calls “invalid hypotheses” that are circulating:</p>
<p>Invalid theory #1: The vaccine is causing infertility. There is absolutely no data to support any impact on fertility or miscarriages from any COVID-19 vaccine. Here’s an older post of mine explaining the vaccine and infertility. But Dr. Heather Huddleston (a OBGYN at University of California San Francisco OBGYN who specializes in reproductive endocrinology) said it best:</p>
<p>“This is a nuisance, it’s troubling in that moment, but it’s not a representation of something that’s going to continue. It’s not a representation of any sort of permanent harm or damage. There is no reason to think there’s reason to be concerned over time, and there’s no reason to think that there’s any impact on fertility.”</p>
<p>Invalid theory #2: Spike protein is puncturing women’s reproductive organs. The spike on the actual antibody is incredibly, incredibly small. There is no biological way this tiny spike punctures the uterine lining and causes bleeding.</p>
<p>Invalid theory #3: Viral shedding from the vaccine impacting health among unvaccinated women. There is no viral shedding from a vaccine. Shedding cannot happen without a live piece of coronavirus. And none of our vaccines contain the virus. (JJ and AstraZeneca do have a live virus but this is an adenovirus and cannot replicate). The vaccines also can’t give COVID-19. So, a person’s choice to get vaccinated has no negative (just positive) impact on an unvaccinated person’s health.</p>

<p>As to the rest of your non sequitur post, I never said anything about any of that stuff so idc.  Nice copy paste though, I hope you're at least getting paid for it.</p>

        <p>Why the fuck should we take you serious when you can’t even spell VACCINE right? Do you and your wife a favor and get yourselves mental health evaluations. Demanding complete strangers get a medical pro cure to make YOU feel warm and cuddle inside is sick. It’s not healthy. It’s wrong. And you both need help!</p>
<p>And what do you have to say to the fully vaccinated people who still died of covid??  Jackass.</p>

        <p>Firstly, im sorry I spelled vaccine wrong a single time in that huge post. I realize it deligitimieses everything I have ever said. Secondly yes, it is maddening to see people die a completely preventable death. Lastly the VAST amount of deaths seen over the last month are unvaccinated people led to there death by misinformation. Unlike you im not a liar, so I will say it is possible to still get covid while vaccinated but that is rare and the vaccine has been shown to significantly decrease the viruses effectiveness and its symptoms.</p>
