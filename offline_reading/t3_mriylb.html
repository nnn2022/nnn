    <strong>what ... if we would offer the planet our apologies by giving back what is most precious to us</strong>
    <p><p>the human species has taken much too much out of the earth, this way weakening the planet and subsequently all species including our own</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>what if we would as a human species collectively seek a consensus that we want to reverse this taking out of her that many  minerals, metals and fossil resources and as a beginning step of reparation towards her</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>give back what is most precious to the human species</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>by tossing overboard all the gold and silver bars what we today so stupidly close away in deep vaults for nobodys use just to have a psychological backup for our economical exchange systems</p>
<p>what if we for once would not throw nuclear radioactive toxins into the oceans but would give back to the planet all the gold and silver bars</p>
<p>for example toss them overboard at the deepest know ocean place, the mariana trench</p>
<p>so that slowly slowly the planetary water masses could erode them and carry them in molecular quantities to wherever it could be of a strengthening supporting finely diluted healing elixir</p>
<p><strong>doing to our mother earth like she has allways done to us ... giving what we cherish most</strong></p>
<p>such a gentle geoengineering project what of course would need some deep philosophical considerations of anyone who at this moment owns some of these gold and silver bars as a sort of backup security</p>
<p>as well as from all of us to consider what other things we have taken from the planet which we could possibly give back to her so she might get stronger again and with her all her children, all human and animal beings, all plant species</p>
<p>something like ... offering nature some of the most precious we human beings cherish as a sign of our dedication to find a more humble place within the web of life</p></p>

        <p>I am entertaining this idea since several years ... especially the aspect of us not making good use of the gold and silver but just locking it away ... this way even occupying more space, using more resources, more stones and stuff to make concrete to construct heavily fortified vaults, spending massive amounts of time and energy inventing unbreakable locks on I don't know how many meters thick iron vault doors ...</p>
<p>its just so much waste what does not do any good to anyone but on the contrary makes people at this very moment destroy rainforest in south america to wash out perfectly well earth and kill all the trees and habitat for animals ... to find what ... some few grams of gold</p>

        <p>of course there are much more simpler ways how we could make a positive impact without needing collective consensus ... like ... us human beings choosing to buy no more products what travelled more than a hundred miles, choosing to buy no more products what were made by enslaving animals, heating our homes with hemp stalks instead of wood, buying plastics made from microalgae and striving for a political restructuring of power distribution towards the only real level ... the level of the local community</p>
<p>so that we could decide all the rules we would want to live with in the ( full ) assembly of all children, youth and adults who live in this local community, this village, this town, this city-district... every permanent resident no matter the age no matter place of birth having the very same weighted voting power</p>
<p>how could we possibly get there ? how could we renew our very basic contracts for our human society, the constitutions of the regional and nation states ?</p>
<p>possibly using concepts like:</p>
<p>-------------------------</p>
<p>the local community, the village, the town, the city-district is its own absolute political sovereign. it receives/inherits all political decision powers from both the regional state as well as from the nation state</p>
<p>the local sovereign community creates, maintains and interpretes the local law, a set of rules what all inhabitants living here and now, permanent residents, are agreeing upon in an every resident including manner. this local law replaces all laws previously made on both regional state level as well as on nation state level</p>
<p>all local sovereign communities receive/inherit a share of the financial and material wealth of both the regional state as well as of the nation state, the size of the share corresponding to the number of communal residents</p>
<p>every local sovereign community at all times is able without conditions to leave/quit/exit both the regional state as well as the nation state</p>

        <p>I think the Earth is and will be just fine, we're just an itch to her, a mild skin condition. I definitely agree that we should stop poisoning our environment, but that's so that we have a better place to live</p>
