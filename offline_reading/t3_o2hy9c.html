    <strong>Anyone remember back in March/April 2020 how scary the BBC website was?</strong>
    <p><p>Thankfully the rest of 2020 and 2021 weren't as bad but going to the BBC's website in March/April 2020 was one of the scariest experiences I have ever had, all the fear mongering + possible impending doom + apocalyptic reporting of the then-unknown covid-19... I can't even describe it.... Just constantly dark and foreboding, I could feel the heavy weight on my chest each day.... until June 2020 when the BLM riots happened and the media conveniently didn't condemn it as a superspreader, and even said that it "may have actually helped stopped the spread" which was what woke me up to the bullshit (similarly when Biden won the election and the celebrations on the streets), and then the rest of 2020 was much better afterwards, like June-December 2020 was amazing, except for March - April 2020. It was a unique feeling that I never had in 2019 or 2021.</p>
<p>But to anyone else who can recall how they felt back in early 2020, post down below your personal thoughts too.</p>
<p>Tbh 2021 has so far been a massive improvement, even better than 2019 (but thats probably because I'm in Texas, so I guess it varies based on location, who is more locked down and who isn't)</p></p>
