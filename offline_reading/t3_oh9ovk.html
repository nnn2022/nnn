    <strong>No one has ever said anything to me.</strong>
    <p><p>When this whole debacle kicked off last March, I knew right away it was bullshit. </p>
<p>First of all, I never get sick. I barely know what sick is. I lift weights, eat healthy, and have never taken any pharmaceuticals. Never gotten a flu shot, never gotten the flu. I get a runny nose when I go running outside sometimes. I sneeze for one night, and then I'm fine the next day. That is the extent of any sickness I ever have. Depression and anxiety are a laugh, just symptoms of not having your life in order and I've always known that. People are always trying to sell you a cure for a disease you don't even have, and people love to blame their own inadequacies on external factors, so they buy into it and munch up the pills just to not have to lift something heavy both literally and figuratively. </p>
<p>So when this whole thing started, I never bought into it. Just somebody trying to sell me something else, in some way. I have never worn a mask on the train, and I take a train every single day for 2 hours. </p>
<p>Nobody has ever told me shit, even in the height of the plandemic. </p>
<p>One time an Asian lady asked if I need mask, I just said no thank you. She stared, speechless for a moment. </p>
<p>And one time a fat guy asked me to move and stand away from him. I did not and he stayed shut. </p>
<p>At work now they are saying that if you upload your vaccine card, you can walk around with no mask. Such bullshit. Might as well make me wear a star of David around my arm. </p>
<p>I just don't wear a mask. Who knows whether I took the fauci ouchie or not? They're not allowed to ask for my medical history. If they want to be sensitive about everything, use their own tactics against them. </p>
<p>So I'm basically just mask free now. As long as you don't act like a huge pussy, nobody's going to mess with you in life. I hear stories about people getting into arguments about masks. Just be tough in your beliefs and nobody's going to fuck with you.</p></p>
