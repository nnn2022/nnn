    <strong>Thank you, NYS, for treating my daughters like lepers and trashing Thanksgiving</strong>
    <p><p>I just got a message from my mom about Thanksgiving, and I just want to light into Cuomo for his fucking paranoia.</p>
<p>For reference, my brother is special needs and lives in a group home with other autistic adults. Since this whole mess began, the state, in its infinite wisdom, has decided that they need to protect these individuals like fine china.</p>
<p>(After they killed off the nursong home residents, I'm not sure I want them to protect anything. That's a whole other rant.)</p>
<p>One of the conditions of letting my brother come home to see my parents and have Thanksgiving dinner is to make sure no one is infected. Since I work from home, I am safe.</p>
<p>My kids, though...</p>
<p>One is a junior in high school. Since she has in-person classes 2 days a week, even with the social distancing and mask mandates, she is somehow not "safe."</p>
<p>The other is working retail while in college. Since she is a "front-line worker," she is not safe.</p>
<p>That means they will not only miss out on their usual Thanksgiving (my ex-wife's family is enormous, so they decided to break up to their smaller homes and celebrate separately), they miss out on seeing their grandparents and uncles.</p>
<p>If this shit keeps up for Christmas, I may riot. Apparently, we can still do that without a mask.</p></p>

        <p>Man I wish I could help you. We don't have any of that shit in Oklahoma. 
All of this "social distancing" nonsense is splitting up families left and right</p>

        <p>My brother is super-honest. If they ask him, he'll answer truthfully, without knowing it may not be in his best interest to keep his mouth shut.</p>
<p>...and now I'm even angrier, as I know that it's the first thing they'll do when he gets home. He'll be like a second-hand narc for the state Kung-flu KGB.</p>

        <p>I do not know. Probably two weeks' quarantine, which with his level of autism will probably hurt him.</p>

        <p>Man I am so sorry. I live in the Peoples Republic of Cuomo as well and I have to catch myself everyday from getting so angry that it rules my life. I am here to riot and protest. Seriously, anywhere in the state besides the city, I will be there to protest that power hungry communist sympathizer.</p>
