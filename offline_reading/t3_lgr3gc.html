    <strong>Understanding Antivaxx</strong>
    <p><p>I'm not a anti vaxxer but I am pro choice and don't want people to be forced to vaccinate however let's not hate on antivaxxers and let's try to understand them by standing in their shoes.</p>
<p>When does someone become antivaxxer and why?</p>
<p>Just imagine you just have a baby and the baby is being vaccinated some days later, you see the damage being done to your baby or even lose your baby because of it, or just imagine losing someone close because of the vaccine, would you wanna warn others about it? I think you would. </p>
<p>If you hate anti vaxxers have you ever think about how it feels losing someone by vaccine and what do you think about people that lost someone close because of it do you still have respect for those people ? </p>
<p>Now think about why you would push the vaccine and think about if you still have respect for people damaged by vaccine or people that lost someone close because of vaccine for pushing it like it's safe</p>
<p>Now let's say you don't believe people can die because of vaccination or can be hurt badly, why do you think that?</p>
<p>Now keep asking yourself the question why you don't believe that can't happen if you think vaccination can't do any harm.</p>
<p>I'm not antivaxxer at all however I do believe it can cause some damage to individuals and I do believe it's possible you can die by vaccination so I do wanna understand the anti vaxxers. </p>
<p>Would you trust vaccination if government start to behave like dictators and even try to force it on everyone and use a lie to do it? </p>
<p>I won't, because vaccinations should never be forced that's not democratic at all and it becomes scary if governments start to act like dictators.</p></p>

        <p>True, I also think this vaccine is not really a vaccine and it's different.</p>
<p>I'm kinda curious, what is this gene therapy and how much is this different from the vaccines most people already got injected with?</p>

        <p>some people are theorizing that the mrna vaccines essentially create "docking stations" in the body.</p>
<p>so if everyone is vaccinated and everyone has these docking stations, in a few year special gene therapy might become highly efficient, eg to fight cancer or whatnot. </p>
<p>this somehow sounds cool, but keep in mind</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>this is experimental and can cause hella damage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this is essentially transforming humans into gene-modified beings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this whole process goes with extended data collection which can and surely will be abused</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>PS: i dont necessarily believe in this</p>

        <p>It sounds like you already understand why someone becomes an anti-vaxxer.</p>
<p>The term anti-vaxxer really represents a wide range of views. Some oppose all vaccines, believe they are inherently dangerous and perhaps largely useless. Some merely believe that too many vaccines are given to children at such a young age, that they should let their own immune system develop before vaccinating. Some oppose certain vaccines because of their contents or their usefullness and wish that they could chose which vaccines they get and not have them bundled up like they are nowadays. </p>
<p>What they all have in common is believing that no vaccine should ever be forced, that a parent has ultimate control over their child's health and that no child should be kept from school or other places because of it.</p>
<p>When my sister became pregnant, she was overwhelmed by the responsibility for her child's health and began reading everything she could find about the recommended and obligatory vaccines (from both sides of the argument), she attended lectures and spoke to as many people as possible about it. She said it wasn't an easy decision at all but in the end she decided against vaccinating her child.
I don't think she would call herself an anti-vaxxer, she would say that she made medical decisions for her son and that's her perogative and her responsibility.</p>

        <p>I'm proud of your sister, she has a good heart and it's good thing she did her research about vaccinations you never know if you really can trust it, it's like playing Russian roulette and I agree it's just different medical decisions and I wouldn't call it antivaxxer either I hate that word it's  like a label to shut someone up for different medical decisions.</p>

        <p>This is how people should converse with one another. We should respect each other’s approaches to what goes into OUR bodies, and what we choose to do with our lives. If, after doing actual research, you are for vaccines then who am I to ridicule you. And the same for me, after doing much research I am against putting most things from big pharma into my body. I have a right to choose comfortably without discrimination. If people want to discuss I am open- however I think everyone can say they are not open to unwarranted criticism. </p>
<p>Unfortunately a lot of people completely shut down anything opposing their way of life, even if it has nothing to do with them</p>
