        <p>I have spoken to a great deal of both voters throughout this election cycle. I must be honest, most are largely uneducated. Ask someone why they're voting Biden? "Bruh trump racist af tho... homophobic, transphobic, sexist, ect". Ask someone why they're voting Trump "He's the right man for the job and he loves this country!". Never a policy named on either side.</p>
<p>However - This has made me realize that I identify 1000% more with the Trump people. They're normal, easy going, not offended at anything, they love America, and most importantly they're KIND! God, Liberals I've met are always nasty and of course it comes from being unhappy with your life - hence Reddit being so pro lockdown. There's nothing to be gained by generalizing but if you don't believe me  - look at some videos of this summers protests. They all sort of have this "look" to them. Whatever it is, there's some collective consciousness at work that even manifests in psychical appearance. </p>
<p>While I certainly would not fit in with Trump voters (Misfit by nature), I'd pick their side anytime. It's not even close. They're just normal people. Most importantly - they want to be left the FUCK ALONE.</p>
<p>As crazy as it is to say, I honestly see this country as - Normal human beings vs. cult like animals.</p>

<p>HEIL!</p>
<p>Really though, these lockdowns are out of control. To my knowledge he is a millionaire which makes his actions even more despicable he puts so many people in pain with these restrictions. I do not recognize my state any longer. People here are completely buying it and actually support these measures.</p>

        <p>I'm not party affiliated- voted Hillary in 2016 and Trump in 2020. This year has pushed me toward the right. There were many reasons, but one thing I learned is that nothing will ever be enough for the Democrats, so I stopped giving them my vote.</p>

        <p>I did a complete 180 since March. A lot of what democrats were saying started making less sense to me and I allowed myself to hear ideas that were outside of the far left cult. It was like I had my blinders removed and I could finally look at things objectively. </p>
<p>I went from an extreme far left neoliberal to a slightly right leaning libertarian in the span of a few days. The riots and the "pandemic" helped me see that I was on the wrong side. I also learned the importance of protecting free speech and the exchange of different ideas. 
If it wasn't for the few dissenting opinions still allowed to exist on mainstream social media, I'd still believe all the lies I did at the beginning of the year.</p>

        <p>I used to be liberal and now I’m a slightly left leaning centrist. But I slowly changed throughout a couple years before this. There was no one moment where I instantly switched. I did the political compass test before and I was about 2 squares to the left from the centre line. I think you can guess if I was authoritarian or libertarian on the other scale. But I’ve been called a Trump supporter or even alt right for simply disagreeing with the mainstream narrative. If Trump supporters have the ability to have individual thought, then I guess I’m one. I didn’t even know I liked him that much, I’m not even American.</p>

        <p>I was in the middle. I did vote for Obama the first time, then Ron Paul the next time. I voted against Trump because he scared the shit out of me. I thought my gun nut friends and conspiracy theorist friends were too overboard. </p>
<p>Then 2020 hit and by April, I was pro gun, pro freedom, and believing "conspiracy theories". I still don't love Trump, but I feel different about him. I have some respect for him now. And I did not vote for Biden/Harris. When people complain about Trump blocking the $600 stimulus, I remind them that Obama did a very similar thing for the same reason, years ago. Congress is always hiding detrimental add on bills into the larger ones. Most Americans don't notice or care. </p>
<p>I was never full left or liberal. I just wanted to be left the fuck alone.</p>
