    <strong>IMPORTANT; To all the health care workers</strong>
    <p><p>I know there's many of us here and i have to warn all of you. There's people here in this very sub and others and also on other social medias who are trying to get informations from us just to get to our employers and get us fired.</p>
<p>They will try to be friendly and pretend to be on your side to find out in which hospital/clinic/center etc your work,specific post,view on vaccination and the virus and restrictions and if you believe in any conspiracy theory (they'll use it to discredit you and make you sound insane) your name and other personal informations such as documents you found at work that confirm everything we all know already.</p>
<p>Please DO NOT share anything ! Be careful about what you say and stay anonymous at all times. This is serious,these people know how to do great harm. They are professionals.</p>
<p>Even if you are not a health care worker,be careful. Always,always,always stay pacific ! That's how they ban and do censorship,they are trying to provoke you to be violent. They are trying to destroy us from within and you'll get arrested even as it happened here already.</p>
<p>I got many private messages and thought they were suspect so check their history,account age etc in doubts don't answer,block them and stay careful !</p></p>

        <p>I think he meant that the people that are finding these doctors personal information and reporting him for wrongthink to their employers are extremely petty not you posting a warning about it I think pretty much everyone on this sub agrees with you that that is unacceptable behavior you don't treat a fellow human being that has different opinions that way but some people will advocate for cancel culture and things like this but you won't find many doing it on this sub</p>

        <p>Troll post attempting to prevent healthcare workers sharing their stories here and silence the narrative. Please ignore it - noone is identifying you from an anonymous reddit post, that is pure paranoia.  We need more of you to share what you know.</p>

        <p>There's not only reddit,as i said they come and try to be friendly just to make you speak and they invite you on other platforms where you eventually relax your guard.Many coworkers got warned too.</p>
<p>Some people are so nice that they cannot imagine that malicious people are trying to manipulate them and i made the post for them.</p>
<p>Trust me i WILL keep speaking even if i have to lose my job over it and with the infornation i have,i will or simply quit if i'm asked to do something immoral. I might be alone in the end but once the pandora box is open,there's no going back.</p>
