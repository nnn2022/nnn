    <strong>Throwing the baby out with the bath water</strong>
    <p><p>is what it seems like we're doing to me.  A nasty virus came along, and with the help of egregious mishandling of said virus, it killed a significant amount of people.  Luckily it was, for the most part, <strong>the</strong> most vulnerable among us, instead of our children for example, who succumbed.  I don't diminish those lives, but people <strong>do</strong> die and they even get sick, and those things were happening before C-19 was even a twinkle in Anthony Fauci's eye.  </p>
<p>But <em>because</em> of that, we have upended our ways of life.  We have allowed small businesses to be destroyed.  We have set policies that have led to even more poverty in the world, leading to even more hungry desperate dying people.  We have restricted Church, putting the very small threat of a negligible virus far ahead of spiritual health.  And we have ignored mental health as well.</p>
<p>What we have done is overreact to a novel virus so much that nothing else seems to matter.  We no longer worry about other health concerns; no one in charge is suggesting that stress from worrying about the virus is a health issue, even though it most certainly is.  C-19 is so much in the forefront that families are fighting over it........ fighting because some think that the only thing that matters is to not catch this one particular virus, and others thinking that there is more to life than avoiding being sick.</p>
<p>There's a dirty baby (the VIRUS) and it needs to be cleaned (quarantine the sick, not the healthy; focus on therapeutics instead of useless masks; promote exercise and good eating habits and positive thinking etc.) and we have decided to not keep the baby, which is good, and instead throw it away because another virus, in a long long long list of viruses, has scared us into thinking that the good in life (the baby) is just not worth taking any risk for whatsoever.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on how to handle the bad, we have decided to just throw out everything.</p></p>
