    <strong>A Doomer Convert Story IRL</strong>
    <p><p>My SO is a public school teacher here in the People’s Republic of Newsomia, so most of his coworkers are what I like to call “normie leftists” in that they don’t have a lot of critical thought about their political leanings, just that they follow the popular progressivist Democrat party line. Today he gets a random call from a co-worker who has been very pro-distance learning, scared of covid, and pretty much wanted to be a good California Democrat who supports our governor. I could overhear part of the conversation and from what I gleaned it sounded like he was trying to shake down SO to capitulating to the pro-lockdown side. </p>
<p>When he got off the phone, I asked what that was all about (I was ready to grab the phone and give coworker a piece of my mind). Turns out, distance learning has been a huge failure for coworker and he recently learned some stats about secondary effects on people that were disturbing and eye opening to him and is now advocating for schools (and everything else) to completely open. I was shocked to say the least. And while I’m sure he’s still going to clean everything and might think masks are good, this is one person who I never thought would change course and he did. </p>
<p>So... it’s happening. Slowly. People are starting to finally smell the bullshit that we all were shouting about months ago.</p></p>
