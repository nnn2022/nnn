    <strong>Healthcare workers, are your jobs mandating the vaccine yet? My job search is not going anywhere due to forced vaccinations and I don't know what to do.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm a nurse and today I received 3 phone calls for jobs and every single one stated that I would need to be vaccinated for both the flu AND Covid before I could work, one even said I would need to have the vaccines before they would even interview me. This is on top of double masking, N95's, and all the other PPE they also mandate. No exemptions were allowed for ANY reason for the vaccinations. </p>
<p>I am very against forced mandated vaccines for everyone. I've been exposed to Covid dozens of times at work and most times I was only wearing a mesh mask at my job, once I had no mask on for an extended period with a Covid patient and I never got sick. This is all bullshit. </p>
<p>Healthcare workers against vaccines, what are you guys doing about this? Or what do you plan to do once the mandates reach your job?  Because I feel like I'm gonna either have to leave healthcare or be homeless in the woods. I do not want a vaccine that essentially does absolutely nothing.</p></p>

        <p>A friend of ours has a traveling icu nurse gig in Boston and wasn't required to be vaccinated. They just extended the 3mo offer through June.</p>
<p>What do people require as proof of vaccination? Can you just present a photoshopped card or one filled in by a friend?</p>
<p>Edit: the fact that you (you personally or others for whom this might be a sane excuse) can't claim exemption based on expecting or planned pregnancy is absolute lunacy, and should be illegal 6 ways from Sunday.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry you're going through that. But I will say, this is going to be the beginning. This will be a slow rollout, wherein it'll start with certain jobs and businesses mandating these vaccines (ex: medical jobs, airlines, cruise lines). Then it will branch out to others, and so will the "need" for the health passports. Soon most, if not all, jobs will require Covid vaccines and who know what other medical "necessities" they will force upon the populace.</p>

        <p>I’m a medical worker. The covid vaccines as well as the flu vaccines are not mandatory. They say they encourage it but it’s not mandatory. I would say about 1/4ish of the staff here declined it. </p>
<p>N95s are not mandatory. We get a surgical mask every day. Gloves are provided but not mandatory, washing your hands is acceptable instead. Goggles or a face shield are supposedly mandatory but half the people don’t bother with them. </p>

        <p>Can't you just lie? Seriously I did this in the UK. I was offered a vaccine ( Pfizer if it matters) and when I went in they asked me is this the first time. I told them it's actually the third as they can't organise anything properly. I said it was shameful they were  wasting this because they couldn't be bothered to fill in my records correctly. I told them I was perfectly happy to have it a third and fourth time as long as they filled in the record properly this time. They caved in and amended my records now I'm recorded as vaccinated.</p>

<p>Edit: they tried making the flu vaccine mandatory but that was a bust. I have never taken a flu vaccine.  Vitamin D made all the difference.</p>

        <p>If people have to take this "vaccine", be sure to take anti blood clotting medication, it's not prescription medication, you need to take it for 3 days, that's the time people have died or stroked out after taking the vaccine, some of these vaccines have dangerous side effects from stroke to heart failure.</p>
