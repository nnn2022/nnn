    <strong>Just got back from Nebraska......husker land has fallen.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm from SW Missouri......the amount of mask conditioning to the Husker folks despite statewide mask mandates stopping March 10th is alarming.</p>
<p>I guess some establishments have signs posted despite the order being lifted.  People put on their masks like good little sheep.  No employees in any places I went said a word to me.  Inside stores in some farm areas it was about 50\50 masks.  As for Lincoln and Omaha.....these progressive leftists make it their job to project the fascism in which they accuse those of. </p>
<p>Had some little guy tell me "MASKS REQUIRED".....Despite me being 20 feet from anyone and asymptomatic.  </p>
<p>I ignored him and went on my way.  He then went out of his way to jump in front of me spiderman style........waved his arms "IT'S ALL ABOUT YOU ISN'T IT!!!"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These fearful people are clearly lost.  There's no reasoning 
with them.  Truly media npc drones running around.</p>
<p>Stay safe out there folks!</p></p>

        <p>When I walk into a large store with 200+ people, I am truly astounded that I am the only person in the room with a pair of balls big enough to take my mask off, let alone question the mask narrative.  Every single time I am the only person.  Like, literally 199 people wearing masks and 1 person isn't.  Sincere ignorance will be the downfall of the American people.</p>
