    <p><p>Spent the day with a big group of friends I haven't seen in a while, and some new people.    No masks.   Hugged one or two (I'm not huggy) and shook hands.   Lots of fist-bumps (I've never been a fan of handshakes), lots of standing at normal distances chatting.    It sure was nice to spend a normal day with other people.   I recommend it.</p>
<p>(For the obscenity-spewing auto-lobotomized trolls out there, just hang tight, I'll post an update in a day or so when I'm ded along with everyone else.)</p></p>

        <p>I recently got my first hug since at least March from an adult (not my child), and it was the best thing ever. I shook the hand of her guy friend too. It's been almost two weeks since then, and we're all still alive and thriving. People have been tearing these kinds of interactions down, but it's so healthy for us mentally and even physically.</p>

        <p>I've been doing that roughly every week since March, with a bit of a gap in the middle. I get more hugs now than I did last year. I've not worn a mask once.</p>
<p>I'm alive, and almost happy. I just need the rest of the world to catch up so that I can start traveling outside the country again.</p>
<p>Though to be fair I've never been a big fan of bars and restaurants where most of the restrictions still are.</p>
<p>Choose to live normally, and you'll find others doing the same. It's great - highly recommend.</p>
