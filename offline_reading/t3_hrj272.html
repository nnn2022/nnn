        <p>Somebody literally told me that wearing masks expresses “solidarity with healthcare workers” </p>

        <p>I’m not a mask skeptic this is true. Masks likely provide some protection against spread. </p>
<p>My issue is there are places where it’s impractical like gyms, bars, restaurants, etc. I think if I’m with friends who are comfortable or if I’m at a place like those there is some level of assumed risk people need to consider. If you are uncomfortable going to a bar for example because people won’t be masked, don’t go. </p>
<p>The argument I hear is “what about workers?”....I do think they should be paid better, but we aren’t talking slave labor. It’s not like people are being forced to work at bars and restaurants.</p>

        <p>That's a reasonable response, thank you. I agree that a lot of places a mask isn't practical we just have a difference of opinion on what that should lead to.  I get frustrated with the people making science-denying statements that masks are 100% ineffective.  While not perfect there is overwhelming evidence that it significantly lowers risk and therefor if implemented can help us reopen more things sooner.</p>

        <p>For all these people saying "I care about others", have you ever sped?  Turned or changed lanes without using your turn signal?  Ever cut somebody off?  Ever run a red light?  Ever roll through a stop sign?  Ever driven with something in your trunk/on you roof that maybe wasn't secured as properly as it should have been because you just needed to get it home?  Ever put off fixing your brakes or replacing dry-rotted tires because "it'll probably be fine another month"?  Ever driven when you've probably had a little too much to drink?  Ever driven after smoking a bowl?  Ever driven when you were tired and feeling drowsy?  Ever talked on your cell phone while driving?  Ever texted while driving?  Ever looked at your phone for any reason while driving?  Ever eaten while driving?  Ever driven in bad weather, even when you didn't really need to leave the house?  Ever drive before your window defrosters have heated up and your windshield isn't perfectly clear yet?  Ever taken your eyes off the road to reach for something in the back seat for a second?  Ever forget to slow down in a construction zone?  Ever fail to move over a lane when you see a cop pull someone over ahead?  Ever forget to stop at a cross-walk?</p>
<p>I guarantee everyone who drives has been guilty of most of these in the past.  Hell, I've probably been guilty of all of them at least once.  Any of these can, to varying degrees, increase your odds of causing a car accident which could cause injury or death to another person.  A lot of these we'll do without thinking twice (like looking at our cell phone to check our GPS directions).  We do them because, right or wrong, we believe the risk of something terrible happening is extremely low and it's not worth being inconvenienced.  And the things I mentioned are all related to driving; I'm sure there are other ways that we increase the risk of inadvertently causing harm to someone that have nothing to do with getting behind the wheel.</p>
<p>So for all these virtue-signaling mask wearers proclaiming that they're doing their part to save lives and calling us selfish for pushing back, I'd like them to answer all of my questions above.  If they answer "yes" to any of those questions they're admitting they're only willing to do something they believe save lives when it's not too great an inconvenience to them.</p>

        <p>Well this looks like a pretty complete survey of dangerous and reckless driving habits: </p>
<ol>
<li>Have you ever sped? Yes, max of 130 km/h which was 30km/h over the posted limit at the time (80 mph/19mph over)</li>
<li>Turned or changed lanes with using your turn signal? No </li>
<li>Ever cut somebody off? Maybe, never intentionally</li>
<li>Ever run a red light? Yes, I got a $365 ticket for being 0.02s after the red</li>
<li>Ever roll through a stop sign? No</li>
<li>Ever driven with something in your trunk/roof that maybe wasn't secured as properly as it should have been because you just needed to get it home? No</li>
<li>Ever put off fixing your brakes or replacing dry-rotted tires because "it'll probably be fine another month"? No</li>
<li>Ever driven when you've probably had a little too much to drink? No</li>
<li>Ever driven after smoking a bowl? No</li>
<li>Ever driven when you were tired and feeling drowsy? No</li>
<li>Ever talked on your cell phone while driving? Yes, Handsfree (still dangerous)</li>
<li>Ever texted while driving? No</li>
<li>Ever looked at your phone for any reason while driving? Yes</li>
<li>Ever eaten while driving?  Yes</li>
<li>Ever driven in bad weather, even when you didn't really need to leave the house? No *I have driven in bad weather but never needlessly only answering second half of the question. </li>
<li>Ever drive before your window defrosters have heated up and your windshield isn't perfectly clear yet? No</li>
<li>Ever taken your eyes off the road to reach for something in the back seat for a second? No</li>
<li>Ever forget to slow down in a construction zone? No</li>
<li>Ever fail to move over a lane when you see a cop pull someone over ahead? No</li>
<li>Ever forget to stop at a cross-walk? Maybe? I'm not sure what this rule is or if we have it in my region, I have to stop at red lights, stop signs and flashing cross walks but not just every cross walk. </li>
</ol>
<p>I scored 6/20 giving myself a half point for each maybe. 7 if I give a full point for each maybe. Thanks for making it a nice round number of questions.</p>

        <p>In the US (or at least my state, not sure honestly) it's a law that you <em>have</em> to yield to pedestrians at all crosswalks.  Most of the time people don't seem to obey this law.</p>
<p>Also, kudos to you, sounds like you're a better driver than most, lol.</p>

        <p>That is not a law in my region, neither is 'not eating while driving' but I can agree that is dangerous.</p>
<p>I haven't been driving that long (6 years?) and got my license at 21 but I definitely was more dangerous in my first 2-3 years than I am now. I went through the survey with my partner and they scored 9.5 and said that I have a bad memory and should have said yes to some no's so change I'll score 9.5 (not the same 9.5).</p>

        <p>I'm not sure if eating while driving is illegal where I am, either.  It might fall under the "distracted driving" umbrella though.  I was actually surprised to find out that <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/eating-driving-80-car-accidents-study-shows-article-1.427796">80% of accidents are caused by eating while driving</a>.  That's the only source I can find on the statistic and it seems insanely high to me, but even if it's twice the actual percentage that's still way more accidents than I would have expected!</p>

        <p>The majority of people with coronavirus are asymptomatic. They can still spread the disease, and spreading that disease can still kill people. Do you test yourself daily? Otherwise it is literally impossible for you to know if you have it or not.</p>
<p>The tests themselves are even inaccurate enough that people who have tested negative have then passed on the disease to others.</p>
<p>Is it worth taking that risk?</p>

        <p>I will take that risk yes. For myself I would take it too, if I was at risk. Solidarity is not muzzling society and forcing everyone to stay home because a miniscule minority is vulnerable. They should take measures, not the majority. Solidarity is not expecting 95% of the people to limit their lives to protect you indefinitely.</p>
<p>People will die. Vaccination won't come in time and won't even protect sufficiently if it even succeeds. Tragedy but the government let it get this far. I am in no way responsible and the "you are responsible as you carry the virus". I am sorry but if I messed up as government and WHO, I would also try to shift blame to people just wanting a normal life.</p>

        <p>And then? After infection rates are down? A looming threat of lockdown and measures until vaccination?</p>
<p>See? This is the problem. I am not gullible. There is no long term plan. </p>
<p>Yes but unlike Lord Farquad:</p>
<p>1: I am not a lord or your lord and I have my own problems to worry about. Most of them created by the measures. </p>
<p>2: That I risk them is bullshit. They created the narrative that I am responsible for their viral threat. No if that were true we would think the same for the flu. It is ad hoc argumentation to guilt me into cooperation. It is the ultimate stretching of third party risk.</p>
<p>3: funny how I am Farquad here but nobody ever cares about african children dying, some of them even due to the measures. It seems only old people have value.</p>
<p>The problem is not that I am necessarily that selfish but that I can think independently.</p>

        <p>15th of July. Still no scientific evidence that asymptomatic are a source of contagion.     </p>
<p>And no, don't link me a random news report with a title saying "Asymptomatic are contagious!" cause when you read deep into those, they always end up explaining that it's actually the presymptomatic and that they are actually infectious as soon as symptoms begin.</p>

        <p>I've also read symptoms can begin very mildly and people write them off until they worsen or later get a positive result (e.g. light fatigue, light chills, slight sniffle written off as allergies). I hadn't read that you are only infections once symptoms begin though, I though you could still be infectious pre-symptomatic but that true asymptomatic was rare and probably low-to-none infectious risk.</p>

        <p>There is also no definitive scientific proof that asymptotic spread is not possible. Surely it’s best to be on the safe side and assume that it is possible? Moreover, it’s possible that someone could have mild symptoms and be contagious - https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2001899 - this article also states that some pre-symptomatic cases could be contagious meaning that people could spread the virus without knowing they have it. However I’m open to any other evidence you may have!</p>

        <p>We can't shape up our lives and society based on assumptions and claim it's for science. There are costs. Assuming all healthy people are potentially dangerous is incredibly toxic.     </p>
<p>And how long do we have to be on the safe side until it's evident that that's not a very significant way of transmission, if at all?     </p>
<p>If there was clear evidence or clear correlation in cases it would be known by know.  We're going 6 months strong into this. Some things are just hiding in plain sight.   <br>
But since this virus is "new" (unlike the other dozen of coronaviruses that are more or less the same), we have to pretend it's <em>tabula rasa</em>.</p>

        <p>The article I linked was not an article based on assumptions but an evaluation of scientific fact. I think it’s always important to have trust in the science. I understand that some articles could be inaccurate so I welcome anything you can find to oppose the article I shared. </p>
<p>In all honesty 6 months is quite a short period of time relatively. We still have a lot to learn for sure and our understanding of the virus will continue to develop. The fact that, already, evidence suggests pre-symptomatic spread and transmission of the virus from mild cases is something to be taken seriously. Seeing as an individual who is pre-symptomatic, asymptotic or who has a mild case might not be aware they are a vector for the virus, surely wearing a mask would help to reduce the chance that the individual would/could pass it on to another person. In many countries around the world social distancing and mask wearing early into the pandemic has contributed to slowing down the increase of cases as there are less cases now in such counties people are now able to return much closer to life as normal before the pandemic. Isn’t this something which everyone can get behind? </p>
<p>Again, I welcome any evidence or persuasion against what I have said. It’s always good to discuss different viewpoints.</p>

        <p>I don't know. What I understand from your link is that there were 2 people presymptomatic cause they developed very mild symptoms a few days later.  <br>
It doesn't report any other people infected from them. Please correct me if I missed something.     </p>
<p>I've got this one. 455 contacts traced from an asymptomatic. 0 contagion.   </p>

        <p>See if I got this straight, based on what I've seen the last five months:</p>
<p>You need to make a homemade mask.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter what it's made of or how it's constructed, it just has to be a homemade mask. That's enough, apparently, for it to work.</p>
<p>That homemade mask, no matter what it's made of or how it's made, doesn't protect the wearer from getting the virus. As you say, "It's not to protect you, it's to protect others just in case."</p>
<p>So the mask only works in one direction, that is, on the exhale where it apparently stops the virus dead in its tracks.</p>
<p>The mask you made at home, with no instruction into materials or construction, so no matter what it's made of or looks like, somehow knows to only stops the virus on the exhale. Remember, your words not mine, "It's not to protect you, it's to protect others just in case."</p>
<p>Now - try to follow me here, I know logic is tough for you libs - if the mask only works on the exhale, and it's to keep others from getting sick, then based on that logic non-sick people don't need to wear a mask, because, as you said, the mask won't stop the virus on the inhale. </p>
<p>And if I'm wearing a mask that stops the virus on the exhale, you should therefore be safe without a mask for when you inhale, because my homemade mask, of materials and construction of my choosing, is stopping me from spreading the virus.</p>
<p>And by that logic, if I wear my homemade mask, that I made with no instruction into appropriate materials or construction, inside-out, won't it then stop the virus on the inhale?</p>

        <p>Except protests. They can wear masks and it’s OK. But the rest of us can’t wear masks and go to a golf tournament or a baseball game.</p>
<p>I get that protesting is an important constitutional right, but allowing those to go on while people wear masks but not letting everything else happen with mask requirements js illogical. (And the protestors definitely weren’t standing and walking six feet apart.)</p>

If masks were the holy grail of public safety , as they have been held up to be by public officials and individuals like yourself , why are we still locking down ?
