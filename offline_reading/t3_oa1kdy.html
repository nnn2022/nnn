        <p>I’ve also noticed how people here [elite institution you have heard of], even though if there is anyone with the capacity to understand the pathogenesis of the disease and the course of its evolution, it is them (many work on the immune system daily and have done so for years) who show exactly zero interest in doing so. We are talking about people who have published dozens cutting-edge immunology papers, including on topics directly relevant to the intrcicacies of COVID pathogenesis, and some of them work on those in the context of COVID right now. And yet…</p>
<p>And they have apparently checked out many months ago, some never checked in to begin with — I had many baffling conversations with people I highly respect for their scientific capabilities all throughout 2020 that showed very weird lack of knowledge of the problem.</p>
<p>But it is really bad now — all the cognitive biases are on full display. “Science” has saved the day and “we”, as in “scientists”, i.e. our perceived in-group, have triumphed, so what could be wrong and how could there be a problem?</p>
<p>And then there is the class conflict aspect of it — most “scientists” right now are perfect examples of the PMC type, and this “solution” to the problem suits them very well — last year around that time everyone was in panic, stock markets were down, university endowments were in free fall, tuition money had stopped flowing in, etc. Now the stock market is up, endowments have recovered, students will be herded back to campuses in the Fall, and even if they have to be sent back in November, tuition will have been collected by then, so everything is good, right? Who dares spoil the party with objections and bleak progonostications about the long-term future?</p>
<p>I’ve literally had people say to me “I don’t want to listen about any doom and gloom”…
