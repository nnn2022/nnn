        <p>Speaking from "the left" -- he has a point!  The political takeover that is happening - and is happening around the globe - is a "fake progressive" agenda.</p>
<p>It is global centralization of power under the guise of sustainability and equality.</p>
<p>But the people advocating for this have no history of sustainability or equality in anything they've ever done. This whole movement, and everyone who supports it -- is doing the opposite of what they claim on the surface.</p>
<p>Traditionally, someone on the "left" would be tolerant and open minded to difference. But these people are aggressive and authoritarian. </p>
<p>I believe that was /u/Count_Calorie 's point... He just said it more succinctly. ;-)</p>

        <p>Genuine question: if you are aware that ‚Äòprogressivism‚Äô is actually the opposite of what it claims to be, why do you still identify as a left-winger? From what I read here, I would think your beliefs align more with libertarian right. </p>
<p>Also, my comment wasn‚Äôt so deep as you gave me credit for, lol. Lockdowns have been deliberately made into a partisan issue and so it happens that the majority of pro-lockdown people are leftists. And they do have a history of being authoritarian and intolerant while accusing the enemy of exactly what they‚Äôre doing...</p>

        <p>Your point about the majority of pro-lockdown people being leftists... That gets tricky. I mean, are Democrats "leftists?" They are some of the least progressive people. Democrats basically support a corporate agenda under the guise of equality &amp; sustainability... Similar to how Republicans support a corporate agenda under the guise of freedom and capitalism.</p>
<p>I probably fall in the safe overlap of sanity where left &amp; right meet. That's very different than "middle of the road", of course, because middle of the road means not changing anything.</p>
<p>Libertarian sounds great until it turns into the idea of allowing someone to hoard limitless wealth in the name of freedom. (Concentrated wealth inevitably undermines government, and if there is no government they become the equivalent.)</p>
<p>"Left" sounds great until what starts as people working together to pool resources for the betterment of all turns into a small number of state capitalists exploting people.</p>
<p>We do have some good things in our society which exist from shared funding. Our highways. The internet. Public utilities (anyone who has experienced privatization of utilities knows it always leads to fewer services that end up costing more.) I could go on and on.</p>
<p>Public schooling is a good example... But once again, what starts as a good idea then turns into a state propagandization network and next thing you know people are so dumb they go along with nonsense like "terror alerts" in 2001 and "covid fear" in 2021.</p>
<p>Some things are just true, regardless of what label you put on it. For example, the larger a government gets - the less say you have in that government.</p>
<p>But at the same time, smaller governments can suffer manipulation and overthrow from larger governments.</p>
<p>In the end, it all becomes very complex when you talk about ideals so I tend to stick to "what direction we should go in" -- because that's real. It starts where we are now and states where we should go next.</p>
<p>And in that case, corporations have too much power. (It's gone global at this point.) Too much wealth is in the hands of too few people, and they've taken control of governments worldwide.</p>
<p>These issues are the tip of the iceberg, really.</p>
<p>But you're right, there's incredible irony that the same Democrats that were skeptical about the PATRIOT act and terror alerts are willing to give up every right in the name of Covid fear.</p>
<p>But truth is, BOTH parties led us into fear-of-terror manipulation just like BOTH parties are using fear-of-covid manipulation.</p>
<p>The bottom line is -- as people, we are not represented at all by our politicians. They are salesmen peddling a global corporate agenda.</p>
<p>I don't know what that makes me. Doesn't matter. I'm just a guy! =)</p>
