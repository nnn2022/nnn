    <strong>Has anybody begun to consider</strong>
    <p><p>changing the avenue of focus, here? I see it acknowledged most every post. We know this is about much more than another corona virus. We know this is an attempt to institute authoritarianism across a unified international front. My larger point being that when the Reddit gods decide to shut this down under the auspices of dangerous rhetoric regarding the viral apocalypse, where will you go, what will you do next to combat global tyranny? Snarky memes about the asinine tactics of govt can be funny but less so when we are living in such times that threaten and compromise our entire culture of existence.</p></p>

        <p>There seems to be some gaining traction over voter reform, requiring voter ID and other measures to make voting more secure and transparent. This is a bright spot in this whole debacle because if we can obtain truly fair and secure elections, our votes will count. We can hope that these changes are implemented in the next election and that we can truly make our voices heard and elect people who reflect our beliefs. Take heart, this can be resolved.</p>

        <p>I think it's beyond that point. Despite the fraudulent election, our right givers &amp; takers acted far outside of their legislative purview and instituted these draconian measures while Trump was sitting. This issue is not an election matter. If we were voting on yay or nay for this shite, that would be another matter. America is afflicted, not excepted from this fanaticism raging across the world. My questions is what will you do or where will you go? Are there no demonstrations being organized from this platform? Don't get me wrong. I'm not advocating for something sinister. I don't want that to be misperceived. But more action apart from keyboard warring may be required when the former is removed.</p>
