    <strong>The mask doomers are so pro-mask because it is literally functioning as a form of auto-erotic asphyxiation for them. It doesn't make sense to be so attached to paraphernalia unless it is fulfilling a fetish.</strong>
    <p><p>This also partly explains the hysteria - madness due to oxygen deprivation. They will say they love masks because they saves lives or whatever, but prior to this episode of insanity, have you ever seen people who actually use masks (anyone in health care) so romantically sing the praises of masks? No, the masks were simply pieces of equipment, to be used in the right context, not a universal beacon of hope or whatever other media message that has been dictated. The masks are the doomers fetish object and/or their voodoo doll to ward off evil spirits.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, especially with the hyper-sexualization that has been going on the last couple decades. I'm flabberghasted how many users I check their history and it's all porno stuff. They even started calling pictures of food and other things "foodporn". </p>
<p>Also the normalization of hookup apps. </p>
<p>I'm not here to judge, but I can't ignore what I've been seeing either.</p>

        <p>Yes I remember these commercials, horrible. TV is shit and they are definitely pushing inappropriate material earlier and earlier onto our kids. On another sub I was in an argument with a self proclaimed leftist poly, pan, lgbtqabshf talking about masks and turns out dudes 15! I was so sad, especially after saying  all this and he’s just a boi ( don’t get this) trying to help but the he wished me and my family gets sick because we refuse to mask. This hypocrisy and shit needs to end and quick. He is proof they have an agenda that is to ruin our children make them all sexless faceless hive mind slaves, who will do anything for the party.</p>

        <p>I think the biggest factor is cognitive dissonance. In many (if not most) cases, the reason that people "wear the mask" is because they're afraid, either of the virus, or of "getting in trouble," or of being socially stigmatized / shamed, or even more benignly just of the extra attention they're apt to receive (or that they might <em>feel</em> like they're receiving) as a result of not conforming (e.g., being the only one without a mask in a particular store).  So they wear the mask. But the story they tell themselves is not "I'm wearing this because I'm a scared, conformist little bitch." That's not very flattering. So instead they convince themselves they're wearing the mask because they're virtuous, they're responsible, and they care about others' safety.  When they see someone else not conforming, on some deep level it triggers feelings of envy and inadequacy because they're seeing someone who isn't afraid.  Demonizing that person is a way of reinforcing the story they're telling themselves.</p>
<p>https://imgflip.com/i/42p7le</p>
<p>Another factor may be that it fulfills some collectivist impulse / desire for self-annihilation.  They don't particularly like their individual identity, and wearing a mask (especially when everyone else is also wearing a mask) partially frees them of that identity  and makes them simply a part of the herd.</p>

        <p>The first paragraph makes the most sense.</p>
<p>I admit I do fear getting in trouble with the police to an extent if they extend mask orders to that threshold. And I don't feel like I got a fair shake at life due to terrible luck, and in this case, bad luck with police sometimes. I also don't want to be kicked out of stores that have essentials I need, since I'm on a specific diet for my health.</p>
<p>So for me, it almost seems pointless trying to argue and debate while walking into a store without a mask. As long as I breathe ok in it, I don't mind placating the crazies just to make my day easier.</p>
<p>It sucks all around the situation we're all in. I hope rebelling against mask orders becomes a bigger thing.</p>

        <p>I carry a gun every day. At this point I <em>have</em> to wear the stupid goddamn face diaper to the store, because we now have ample video evidence of the psychotic and violent lengths the mask fetishists will go to impose them on the nonconformists. I don't want to go to prison for the rest of my life because somebody attacked me for "breaking the rules" and I was forced to shoot them. Doesn't matter the circumstances, doesn't matter how badly they hurt me first, in the current climate the white guy with a gun and no mask is going to prison forever <em>period</em>.</p>

        <p>That's part of why I kinda don't want a gun yet. I wouldn't even use it, or any weapon, until push really really really comes shove. So long as there remains infrastructure capable of enforcing legal consequences, I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't. The police don't particularly like me. I got in trouble when I was younger, never formally convicted of anything, but I'm probably on certain lists. If I try to defend myself, it would bite me in the ass. A firearm would only make it worse.</p>

        <p>Yeah going maskless in high-stress places like grocery stores really goes against the fundamental tenant of concealed carry, which is "don't draw attention and don't start shit". You're kinda signing on to be an unremarkable person who doesn't fight people over petty stuff, even if it means not always being able to stand up for yourself like you want to.</p>

        <p>While this might be a stretch for most, there is no doubt the most vocal maskers are getting a distinct type of pleasure by identifying with a side. Humans naturally get pleasure from being associated with something. Ironically, the most pro maskers are also typically the most anti religious. You're just replacing a burka with a mask.</p>

        <p>It's more the warding off evil spirits part. They take a quasi-religious approach to the whole thing (in part because they don't understand enough about health to look at it scientifically, even from the perspective of an intelligent non-expert who doesn't get all the jargon). They see things like masks protect other people, and don't grasp that (a) it's not proven to work like that outside controlled lab settings and (b) even if it turns out it works, it's a small reduction in transmission risk, because most people don't have the virus and the odds of getting it in casual, brief contact from someone who <em>does</em> but is still healthy enough to go to the store and doesn't have obvious symptoms is very low. (And c: complications beyond cold/flu symptoms are rare except in the highest-risk populations.) What they see, on a subconscious level, is magic: if you don't wear it you'll make other people sick and many of them will die, and if you do, everyone around you is magically protected from your disease. Someone on TV with a title said it protects others, so they think it's true, all the time, with no nuance or caveats.</p>

        <p>I think it’s more a religious thing.  The people pushing masks the hardest are these left wing types who typically claim to be non-religious.  But we know humans have an innate desire for religion.  So they have covid and “science” and they’re priests are people like Fauci.   Their God is Covid for giving unto them the things they desire:  pseudo-power, pseudo-intellectual prowess, free covid money, and an excuse to be weirdos.</p>

        <p>This is 100% true. There’s also elements of bondage/gagging fetish and medical/clinical fetish. Symptom of hypoxia is euphoria. Simply put, either wearing the mask or seeing others in it feels <em>really</em> good to a lot of people for some very, very wrong reasons. Yes I am kink shaming and judging big time, deal.</p>
