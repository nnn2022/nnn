    <strong>Stop wearing masks!</strong>
    <p><p>I walk into stores and I see everybody wearing masks. But when I don't wear one, 9 out of 10 times nobody confronts me about it. 1 out of 10 times I am in a store I am confronted by somebody. I will put a mask on in the case where it's an employee, because I don't want to create a scene, but I make a mental note to not go back to that place. </p>
<p>If I polled everyone in any given store in my neighborhood I bet at least 50% of them would be against masks, or at least indifferent about it, but they all wear them anyway because of the fear that they will be confronted by some Karen or canceled somehow on social media for not wearing a mask. </p>
<p>Enough is enough. Most people wear masks because they are afraid of Karens, not the actual virus. Get that through your head. Next time you reach for your mask when you go into Walmart think "Why am I doing this?" </p>
<p>It's because you're a pussy. </p>
<p>Also I have this idea for when I get confronted about not wearing a mask. When you post anything on facebook they put the cdc link in your post with the cookie cutter information on covid</p>
<p>Now what if someone made a concise fact sheet about covid, with the actual facts, that we could all print out a bunch of copies of to hand out to people who question us for not wearing masks. Because people need to become educated on the virus. The media hasn't done it's job. </p>
<p>Can someone make these fact sheets? I would be willing to help with formatting and do some of the writing but I would like some help on it and make sure theres demand for such a thing. Let me know guys.</p></p>

        <p>But let me tell you a little story...</p>
<p>I went to my local Harbor Freight a few days ago  to buy some tarps and bungee cords.</p>
<p>( I needed to repair the "Shelter Logic" structure I use to store my mowers and the kids' bikes during the winter. )</p>
<p>Oh. Look! Drill bits are on sale!  I'll grab some of them too. </p>
<p>I am not wearing a mask/face covering. Despite all the signage,  it is not a law, and I am not required to wear one under penalty of prosecution. </p>
<p>About two aisles in to the store, a gentleman (that is the last time I will use that term, but I always start out respectfully) approaches me with a box of paper surgical marks and says "Do you need a mask?"</p>
<p>I politely reply "No, I'm good." And begin to walk away. </p>
<p>I hear "I wasn't asking. You NEED a mask. If you are in MY store you NEED to wear a mask."</p>
<p>Me: "Fine. Whatever." And pull my neck-gaiter style out of my pocket and slip it over my head as I walk away.   Mind you,  I'm wearing a baseball hat and glasses so there are a couple of steps involved here. </p>
<p>I reach the end of the aisle and there is ANOTHER "gentleman" approaching me from the direction of the stock room. </p>
<p>I turn, Guy 1 is following me very closely. </p>
<p>Guy 2: "You NEED to wear a mask CORRECTLY. "</p>
<p>(I'm adjusting and positioning my neck gaiter.) "That means all the way up and covering your nose.</p>
<p>Me: "Yeah.  I get it. It's dumb. But I get it."</p>
<p>(Gaiter has slipped off my nose at this point. )</p>
<p>Guy 2: "Please put it on CORRECTLY,  completely covering your nose."</p>
<p>Me: "Yeah. I will."</p>
<p>Guy 1: "Now!"</p>
<p>I realize Guy  1 and Guy 2 have now triangulated the two aisle in front of me and there is a pallet of boxes behind me. </p>
<p>(DAMMIT! How did I let my Situational Awareness slip like that?)</p>
<p>Guy 2: "Now please.'</p>
<p>Guy 1: "I'm going to have to ask you to leave your gun in your vehicle."</p>
<p>(I'm open carrying.)</p>
<p>"You  are making a scene and I would prefer you didn't have a gun in MY store."</p>
<p>Me: "Nah. That's not how this works."</p>
<p>Guy 1: "I'm going to need you to leave."</p>
<p>Me: "Fine. Whatever. Your loss, not mine."</p>
<p>Guy 1: "Not mine at all,  now come on, I need you to leave."</p>
<p>I leave my cart in the middle of the aisle and begin casually walking toward the front door.</p>
<p>Guy 1: "You need to leave NOW! You are refusing to wear a mask. You are making a scene! AND you have a gun that I asked you not to have."</p>
<p>He then reaches out to "guide" me toward the front of the store. </p>
<p>I've had enough.</p>
<p>Me: "Don't you  DARE put your FUCKING HANDS ON ME!'</p>
<p>Guy 2: "Do you want me to call the police?"</p>
<p>Guy 1: "If he doesn't leave RIGHT NOW, yes."</p>
<p>Me (gaiter around my neck, smiling, laughing): "This is bullshit, but whatever,  you can bet your ass I won't be back."</p>
<p>Guy 1: "That's fine. I don't care. I want you out of MY store!"</p>
<p>Guy 1 and Guy 2 proceed to stand on sidewalk  and watch me walk away, both trying to look like Joe Badass.</p>
<p>Me, still annoyed at myself for letting my SA slip,  take a VERY indirect route back to my truck then drive away shaking my head at the absurdity of it all.</p>
<p>FWIW, I went to the Tractor Supply at the other end of the shopping center and bought what I needed, maskless, no questions asked.</p>

        <p>Damn bro. Yeah I've had to deal with these toxic mf's a bunch too. </p>
<p>You want me to stay 6 feet from you when you're shopping in walmart? Fine. But I also have to wear a mask? It's ridiculous. Most of the time nobody gives me shit when I'm in the hardware store. True Americans shop at hardware stores.</p>

        <p>The gas station chain I used to go to all the time strictly enforces masks so the hadji marts are getting more and more of my business. I'm happy to give them my business.

        <p>Sorry you had to deal with mask zealots.  The way they were talking to you was very disrespectful, they're not your master. I refuse to even mask up when told.  I just leave. THEY are the ones losing money when they tell you that you can't be in their store without a mask. I'll avoid harbor freight now that you've shared your story.

        <p>I’ve found that the best, and most effective, response is to say you can’t for medical reasons.  It’s a serious HIPAA violation for employees to question it. I believe it’s something like a $75k fine for the first time they question you, followed by $150k fine anytime after that. Either way, it hasn’t failed me yet.</p>

        <p>Wrong. According to the ADA, HIPAA applies to EVERYONE. Your employer, the businesses you buy things at, etc.</p>
<p>They are supposed to assume you have an exception if you are not wearing a mask, not confront you.</p>

        <p>I generally don't wear a mask, but carry a "face covering" in my pocket because I am not going to cause some young person to get jammed up or lose their job... Think the high school or college kid working as a host/hostess at a restaurant, etc... If they ask nicely I'll put it on, they are not virtue signaling, they are just trying to make their money.</p>

        <p>That’s reasonable. But I wonder is it really their job to do that? They can ask you and you could politely decline, and what else can their manager expect them to do?</p>

        <p>Not much I assume. </p>
<p>But I so no reason to be disrespectful to a young person just doing what they need to do to make some money. </p>
<p>They didn't make the policy.</p>
<p>It's not their fault. </p>
<p>I don't agree, but I can't teach my children to show respect if I don't model it. </p>
<p>You know the old saying: "Treat the janitor with the same respect you would treat the CEO."</p>
<p>Hell, IMHO, the janitor deserves MORE respect.</p>

        <p>I sort of disagree. These "young people" have free will and they don't need to jam you up over a mask. Just like the clerk doesn't have to ask a 40 year old for I.D. They choose to do these things. Humans have a choice. I worked at a gas station many years ago and they told me to card anybody who looked under 30. I didn't card anybody at all. Because I have free will and chose not to be a f*ggot. Same with these kids asking you to put a mask on. They don't have to say a word.</p>

<p>Right.  I believe in science and compassion.  I trust data and reliable experts and weed out the extremes on both sides.  Obviously I am the one detached from reality.  The people who shout, "The numbers are fake!" so that they don't have to sacrifice or worry are clearly the ones living in reality.</p>

        <p>The reason that people back away is not that you look "mean".  People don't want to walk up to someone who is not wearing a mask.  None of you are choosing not to wear masks for health reasons.  If that was the reason, or even a legitimate belief that masks don't work, you would make other efforts to avoid spreading the virus in case you were unknowingly contagious.</p>

        <p>Has anyone actually been given a citation though? In Michigan we had a similar "mandate" that supposedly was punishable with a 500 dollar fine. Not a single citation was ever issued. The threat was enough to get most people to obey though.</p>

        <p>Very beautiful and not many people.  The closest gas station/quick stop store is the next town over that will impose that outrageous disgraceful fee.  I have to go three towns further were there are several stores and regular shopping but I only go into these three stores due to this mask wearing crap.  Mask mandates in every friggin store though, no fines except gas station.   We have pig Cuomo running thr shit show so it’s all jacked up here with useless mandates.</p>

        <p>It’s impossible for me. I wish I could but in my country (Turkey) masks are mandatory EVERY PUBLIC PLACE. </p>
<p>If you don’t (and risk paying a fee) you are frowned upon and seen as the “stupid, conspiracy theorist” one. Every well-known political party is pro-mask and pro-lockdowns and there are few people think the same with us.</p>

        <p>I was standing behind this lady grabbing donuts at the local grocery store. Maybe 4 feet behind her just waiting. She turns around and says “since your not going to wear a mask you can take a step back”. I take 1 step back of about 3 inches and say nothing. She proceeds to grab 3 donuts and she is morbidly obese. I grab 12 donuts for my employees and get some emergen-c. I guess we saw who was more worried about their health</p>

        <p>I've only been confronted a handful of times. Instead of a fact sheet, I have a fake doctor's note ready to go. I got a local medical clinic's logo off their website, made up a couple of bad-sounding medical conditions ("lung polyps" and "bronchiectasis"), and used the name of my college crush as the doctor. Between that and the inhaler my asthmatic friend gave me, I'm batting close to 1.000.</p>

        <p>I got it 2 months ago. Had a headache and a runny nose for 2 days. I stayed home while I had it and for a few days after I was better. When I had to go to the store for dog food I wore a mask and socially distanced just in case. That's what should be done. If you have symptoms, you should stay away from people and wear a mask if you need to go out. But to force symptom free healthy individuals to wear masks 24/7 "just in case" is silly and ridiculous.</p>
<p>Seriously it wasn't that bad. Do your own research.</p>

        <p>I do do my own research, as I’m currently a nursing student who holds a cna license and my sister is currently an rn, while you yourself might not have experienced symptoms people who might be immunocompromised or even diabetic won’t, that’s why wearing a mask in public and properly is vital. You might have felt like it was the flu but the people in the hospitals don’t, the old folks I care for in the nursing home don’t. This purely isn’t about you but about other people, millions of other people who won’t just get a runny nose and a headache. Glad you at least respect to wear a mask when feeling symptoms, and I hope you also question the sources these “truth seekers” bring forth</p>

        <p>Well, you can't hold society hostage for an entire year to save the immunocompromised. These people
are going to get sick one way or another. </p>
<p>Asymptomatic spread is not a driver of infections. </p>
<p>People under 65 without preexisting conditions have a very minimal chance of serious symptoms. </p>
<p>Masks have not been proven effective. The research into them has been mixed. If you look at countries and regions that implemented strict mask mandates and compare to places that had low mask compliance or no mandates, you will see no correlation.</p>
<p>Also, I don't care about other peoples health plain and simple. If other people are unhealthy, not my fault. Not my fault some people have either bad genetics and/or poor health habits.</p>

        <p>I agree with the holding society hostage, we should isolate and strictly quarentine those who test positive and make sure they’re able to be sufficient for two weeks with food, shelter and entertainment. What makes this difficult is covid it’s self.</p>
<p>Covid has a weird incubation time where for a few days after you’re exposed do you begin to show symptoms, meaning you could potentially spread it during that period and not test positive which makes the timing of being able to isolate people tricky.</p>
<p>Masks are effective, just depends on what kind you wear. The cloth ones you buy at most department stores probably aren’t that trustworthy, but specifically made surgical and medical grade ones definitely are, otherwise doctors and nurses wouldn’t be wearing them for droplet or airborne protocol.</p>
<p>And regarding your last point, I just hope your neighbors and peers don’t have that same selfish mentality when it comes to your time of need</p>
