    <strong>What Countries &amp; States Would Refuse to Accept The Rules That The Victorian Government Has Enforced?</strong>
    <p><p>In Victoria, yes surprising I know, two old ladies were harassed on a park bench in Melbourne for being outside without masks by police, who snatched one of their phones without reason. They apparently needed 5 big, tough police officers to confront these old women. Now this more than anything has got me wondering where have Victorian police got their mindset at the moment where you're stealing phones off old ladies and interrogating them about what they are doing outside and at the same time thinking 'I'm a good person, I'm doing a good job, I'm protecting people and saving lives.' Because I know for a fact if I was a police officer (seriously considered becoming one at one point) I would think all this shit they are doing is insane and I would refuse to do a job where I harassed people for sitting on a park bench or arrested people for posting on Facebook. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And even worse, it seems most of my countrymen support this rubbish! Or at least the ones who do internet polls and go on Facebook. Even then though, I'm inundated with people at my job (petrol station manager in a small rural NSW town) complaining about 'those idiots in Victoria not doing the right thing' - and no they aren't talking about the idiots in government or dickhead police officers, they are talking about people not wearing masks or being outside for more than an hour. It really makes me wonder how far our government could go while our citizens still blamed the victims for 'doing the wrong thing'. I used to be heavily anti-cynical and believed that most people are good, but while I'm still anti-cynical, I'm really starting to doubt whether most people are well-meaning. I had doubts about the average person's intelligence before, but now I can't say these people are well-meaning but dumb, they are just straight up morons without an independent thought in their heads. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So, to restore my faith that most people still believe that all people should have basic rights and freedoms, virus or not, what countries out there have governments, police and general populace that would condemn the actions of the Victorian government and police? Do you live in or know of any states or countries that if their heads of government and police came up with the rules that Victoria has, their government workers and police officers would say 'fuck that' and refuse to enforce it?</p></p>

        <p>Arizonans were getting ready to show up to state government buildings with proverbial pitchforks if our governor hadn’t opened on May 15th like he did. We accepted the minuscule closures of bars, gyms, theaters &amp; waterparks for about a month but he started reopening those when lawsuits were threatened.</p>
<p>The litigiousness of US society often works in citizens favor when it comes to this stuff. Most of it’s unconstitutional and some judges are fucksticks but many of them will side with businesses when it comes to unlawful closures and government rolls over to avoid having to shell out money if they lose the lawsuit. </p>
<p>Sometimes the sue-happy nature of Americans bothers me but in this case it’s lawsuits forcing governors to rethink their draconian measures. Not working so well for places like California but a lot of red states that have attempted overplaying their hands have had suits won against them and things opened. </p>
<p>Additionally, in a sprawling state like Arizona or Nevada, enforcement of something like in Victoria would be impossible. They won’t launch drones because we would shoot them out of the sky with our still-legal guns and the states don’t want to pay for all the shot up drones. There aren’t enough police to even begin to police peoples movements when you’ve got actual crime being committed regularly throughout the city. It just wouldn’t be possible here without gun confiscation and that wouldn’t be possible whatsoever.</p>

        <p>Yeah we have that wild Wild West mentality out here. And our police pick their battles. Police deal with legitimate violent crime all around the US. The most they’re willing to do is issue a quick ticket like in CA with businesses going against current restrictions. Our cops already said they wouldn’t entertain citizen snitching about activity on private property. We don’t have the manpower in the police force to monitor shit beyond the half assed job they’ve done so far (and I’m grateful for this). There’s a reason they haven’t used drones anywhere in the US: cops don’t have the time to man them or worry about following up on what’s captured. Regular crime keeps them busy enough.</p>

        <p>There's definitely still actual crime going on in Melbourne. For example drug dealing is still going on as heroin addicts are still going to the legal injecting room to shoot up, which they are allowed to do after 8pm no questions asked while all other law-abiding citizens can't take a step out their front door.</p>

        <p>I live in NSW, in my area people ignored the rules we did have the first time and even the local police didn't care when there was large gatherings right in front of them. Everyone I know or meet is against it, and talks about how this virus isn't what the media and government pretends it is. People don't want anyone to get tested "in case Gladys pulls an Andrews". I'm sure there's doomers but they don't outnumber those who just want to live. </p>
<p>There were cases in America where a family had police turn up and force ankle monitors on them for not complying after one tested positive but had no symptoms - not singing a document that stated they had to get permission to go to hosptial for any reason, so understandable they wouldn't sign. People arrested for not wearing masks in many countries etc etc.</p>
<p>Victoria may be extreme, but it seems many countries have examples of extreme areas or extreme examples of awful shit happening. Also people begging for such extremes to happen. So yeah, perhaps around the world it could happen almost anywhere.</p>

        <p>As frustrated as I can be by the US response to the virus, there are reasons nothing like as extreme as the system of restrictions they have now has happened here imo.  I wouldn't say even in the Bay Area was it quite as strict and definitely not anywhere statewide imo.  It's not constitutional and they know it.  And we have had sheriffs refuse to enforce various restrictions.</p>

        <p>well I wouldn't necessarily go that far... there are a lot of complexities to that which are pretty off topic here... nonetheless, I am grateful that in this specific situation some sheriff departments have drawn the line at enforcing particular restrictions</p>

        <p>Fortunately for us rural Australians the stereotypical Aussie is based on us, dusty country bloke drinking beer and dealing with snakes in the outback. Unfortunately for us most Australians are not us, the vast majority live in the capital cities and the majority of us who don't still live on the coast. Melbourne in particular is full of latte-sipping hipsters. </p>
<p>A lot of us out here in rural Australia are getting fed up as the suicide rate in rural areas is far higher than the covid death rate, with next to no media coverage and very little assistance compared to the ridiculous measures we've had to put with for covid.</p>
