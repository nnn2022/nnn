        <p>While correlation does not equal causality one cannot help but ask ‚Äúare masks actually hurting?‚Äù With cases ‚Äúexploding‚Äù all over and with the CDC themselves reporting that the vast majority of new cases report mask usage ‚Äúalways or nearly always‚Äù, could the reason be as simple as masks are creating a reason for people to touch on or about their faces more than usual? I hypothesize this is so.</p>

        <p>There are already dozens and dozens of sources and clinical studies proving masks spread infection because you touch your face more, it‚Äôs dirty and harbors bacteria, plus it aerosols particles more than not wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>Not laziness. I live in a mask mandate state. I defy the order daily but keep the same paper mask in my pocket just in case they tell me I have to leave, or call the police on me. It's never happened. But I do carry the piece of crap for months on end, just in case. It's filthy lol and has "THIS IS STUPID" written in marker on it.</p>

        <p>The concept of masks causing increased risk of formite contact as well as still allowing virus particles to disseminate into the environment once the oh-so-precious droplets evaporate has been observed and documented for decades.</p>
<p>You don't even have to get into the filtration and fit characteristics to observe the improper usage by the general public, even (if not especially) the Doomers. Cloth masks have been shown to increase risk of illness compared to no masks or N95s. I can dig up that study for any interested, but it's pretty plainly laid out.</p>
<p>Investing in better air filtration to include UV scrubbers and disinfectant sprays in ventilation ducts are far more worthwhile pursuits than thinking any kind of face covering that isn't a N95+ or CBRN mask is going to somehow stop the spread. Not to mention the idea of "stopping" the spread is asinine and not grounded in reality.</p>

        <p>Ok, so here is an actual independant scientific study with full methodolgy from 2009, proving that masks are effective in reducing the transmission of numerous different viruses.</p>

<p>According to Table 4 when you look at the individual adults who came down with influenza-like illness, these are the results:</p>
<p>No masks: 16 out of 100, 16%</p>
<p>Surgical masks: 19 out of 94, 20%</p>
<p>P2 masks: 14 out of 92, 15%</p>
<p>So in other words, surgical masks results in 4% more sickness; the P2 masks are not even close to being significant differences to no mask at all especially in light of the horrendous setup of this study and the fact there were 8% less people.</p>

        <p>Yep, that group dealt specifically with Intention to Treat analysis, or the household that was already infected and waiting treatment. And within that cohort there was no significant difference.</p>
<p>If you go through the rest of the study, the main problem was 'adherence'. That when people did NOT use the masks properly or regularly, there wasn't any significant decrease in infection rates. AND less then 50% of the population didn't use masks properly or regularly.</p>
<p>When there was proper and regular use of P2 or surgical masks there was a 60%-80% drop in infection rates. (Presented in Results-Disscusion paragraph) .... which is why OP may question their effectiveness because enough people just aren't using them regularly, or properly.</p>

        <p>P2 mask, full compliance: 1/12 = 8.3% lab confirmed illness</p>
<p>Control without mask: 3/100 = 3% lab confirmed illness</p>
<p>Considering that a P2 mask is the same as the N95 mask which protects the wearer, it's remarkable that they were 3x as likely to get a virus per lab results than the people without a mask at all.</p>
<p>Since the current message from the CDC indicates that surgical masks are different than N95 masks, insomuch as the former allegedly protects others while the latter allegedly protects the wearer, something is radically wrong with the results of the fully compliant surgical mask group having a seemingly better outcome of 0% lab confirmed illness.</p>
<p>Of course, those were only 18 adults compared to the 100 in the control group. If a single one had been confirmed to have a virus in the lab, that would have gone to 6% or 2x as much as the control. That highlights the problem with such an extremely small sample size (n=18) for the comparison when extremely small variation can have exaggerated impact.</p>
<p>What's also interesting is that only 2.5% (1/39) of the non-compliant surgical mask users were lab-confirmed to have viruses. It seems that not wearing a mask in a non-control group made you less likely to get a virus than not wearing a mask in the actual control group. Fascinating. Moreover, the surgical mask group with varying degrees of compliance still resulted in 6/94 lab confirmed illness (6.3%) which is still 2x as much sickness as the actual controls.</p>
<p>And finally, the authors of the study discuss that people may have stopped using those masks because they got sick and realized it was pointless. This in turn would make it artificially appear that full compliance proved 100% effective which is clearly absurd in light of the CDC guidance on those masks:</p>
<p>"We emphasize that data in the Technical Appendix Table should be interpreted with caution as it is possible that adherence is modified once persons have symptoms. For example, adults who plan to comply may stop doing so after they become sick on day 1. If this is the case, the group of 'adherent users for 5 days' would select those who wanted to comply and did not get infected, leading to overestimation of the effect of adherent mask use."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2662657/bin/08-1167_Techapp-s1.pdf">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2662657/bin/08-1167_Techapp-s1.pdf</a></p>
<p>Even assuming that you look at "symptoms" instead of actual lab confirmed viruses, the control group still fared better than the masks with all ranges of compliance. For the control, 16% (16/100) showed illness. For the masks, 18.8% (35/186) showed illness. This study actually proves masks make you more likely to get sick, so thanks for the link.</p>
<p>I would be curious if you could find a pre-2020 study that doesn't contradict its own control group and actually controls the variables.</p>

        <p>No, that's my point. Such a conclusion by the authors cannot be drawn from the data in any meaningful way about that. Therefore, their statement is nonsense.</p>
<p>As for surgeons and nurses wearing masks during surgery, that has also proven to be irrelevant to infection rates: "No evidence was found to support the use of surgical face masks to reduce the frequency of surgical site infections."</p>

        <p>Key words: comply properly
When people COMPLY PROPERLY maybe masks work. The problem is people will not COMPLY PROPERLY so maybe these masks are causing more harm than good. Do you think it's healthy to wear a mask for the 68th time that you had to dig out of your ass pocket? Because that's what Joe Shmo's doing. Ms. Doe just dropped her mask on the street and put it on before going in the store. Who's that helping? The problem with all these studies are that none of them take into account human behavior. If your plan hinges on the fact that we need 100% PROPER COMPLIANCE for it to work, then it's not going to work in REALITY</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, I don't think these findings hold up in our current situation. They specifiy providing information on how to properly wear and fit the mask. How many people have been taught how to properly wear a mask and how many people actually uphold those standards? Is the average person sanitizing their hands before putting their mask on or are they digging it out of a sticky cupholder and slapping it on? I would bet any money they
 average person isn't properly utilizing their mask. I think we all know just how gross people can be. I remember some study that said 69% of men don't even wash their hands after taking a steaming dump and you think these people are wearing their masks properly?</p>

        <p>That's exactly the study finding, that when the masks are used regularly and properly there is a 60%-80% drop in infection rates.</p>
<p>The issue isn't that 'masks don't work', because they do. The problem is people just not being conscientious enough to use them properly. That's an individual taking on responsibility for community health.</p>
<p>Not an issue in various asain countries, because they've already been through a couple of pandemics and make a collective effort to reduce spreading it.</p>

        <p>Do you have a study done with reality taken into account? I want to know if masks actually work when used by the average person who does not and will not ever care to use them properly. We can shame and stare meanly at people but that doesn't mean they will wear masks correctly. This study is moot and does not apply to the REAL WORLD. </p>
<p>F.Y.I EVERYONE has been through COUNTLESS pandemics since the dawn of time and we're still here. Not just Asian countries</p>

        <p>Then there is this:</p>
<p>https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article</p>
<p>&rt;Although mechanistic studies support the potential effect of hand hygiene or face masks, evidence from 14 randomized controlled trials of these measures did not support a substantial effect on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza</p>
<p>Randomized controlled studies are the highest quality studies and this one did a review of 14 of them and found not enough of a significant impact. The science we have today are mostly crappy mechanistic or compute model studies.</p>

        <p>that is just one study. the vast majority show they are not effective. there are meta-analysis reviews by heath authorities (such as the who and cdc) with the same conclusion. masks are now political.</p>
