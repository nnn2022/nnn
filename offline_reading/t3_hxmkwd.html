    <strong>I have nothing - a high schoolers perspective</strong>
    <p><p>Hi everyone. I'm almost 17 (birthday is the 28th), class of 2021 and just can't cope with anything that's happening. First it was color guard canceling half of the season. Everything my group spent hundreds of hours on was gone, no awards, no recognition. Just wiped away. Then it was no school, online AP tests that feel like a big joke. Sleeping through my online classes, too tired and too bored to care. Impossible to connect with others over a screen. Couldn't focus, turned things in months late, managed to get straight As. It all feels like a big joke.</p>
<p>I had expectations. I wanted to take my favorite classes and do really well in them. I wanted to perform my last seasons in color guard and make them the best. I wanted to drive and meet up with friends and have fun. Apply to college and not worry if it's going to be open ever again. I miss feeling like a person.
This next marching season is basically cancelled. No live competitions at all. Practices are 90 minutes only, masks required, no standing together. Band camp was supposed to be sleep away camp in the Poconos, all of us having fun, got cancelled. No championships, no stadium. No recognition. This was the only thing I enjoyed about high school and it's robbed from me. Forgotten. Not to mention anything about indoor, which probably won't even happen with itchy fingers on triggers to end every event into 2021 or more. I waited 4 years and worked myself to the bone to perform in color guard. But what does it matter, right? </p>
<p>I'm sick of it. I'm so angry and sick and tired and just want to snap. Snap at everyone who doesn't listen, who refuses to understand, who thinks it's not a big deal. My high school and college years are being stolen from me. It's only a matter of time before school is cancelled, then indoor, then prom, then graduation. Not to mention no friends, no meeting a boyfriend, none of the teenage experience. I'll be even more irreversibly socially stunted. I shouldn't even be surprised. I'm just lying in my bed rotting away because there's no point in pretending to be positive and happy. Every little foothold of optimism no matter how tiny is ripped from me. The people on the streets don't look human, they're threatening, I hate only seeing their eyes. And more and more the feeling sets in that this will never change. It will only get worse. And if it does, some years from now, I will never get these things back. Senior night, graduation, championships, bus rides, performances, practices. They are lost forever.</p>
<p>I'm almost certain no one would care if I died. My parents act like they're sick of me and my mom doesn't permit me to be sad. I feel discarded. I can't cope. It hurts too much. The year I thought would be my year gets thrown out. Everything I've worked for comes to nothing. Whenever I really want something, whenever I try my hardest, I never get it. I don't plan on getting out of bed. Because they can't cancel rotting away in my bedroom alone.</p></p>

        <p>First of all, I am so sorry this happened to you. It is extremely devastating to miss out on these events in your life. I was not a good student like you seem to be. Still though, I understand your frustration and the very real pain this is causing. </p>
<p>Reading this makes me hopeful, you have so much more time left on this planet than I do, but you will be inheriting one of the worst economies ever. </p>
<p>Do not forget who did this to you. The WHO, the CDC, the many leaders who abdicated their responsibility to the constitution in the name of safetyism. It seems our world has been captured by Big Pharma and their many surrogates. </p>
<p>As this fades and whatever comes next, try not to hold on to the anger as rage (that's what I did with mine and it took a long time for me to deal with that), instead use this as fuel to work and destroy their sphere of influence. </p>
<p>A better world is one where Dr. Anthony Fauci is known to be the self-discrediting hack he is. Where men and women like Andrew Cuomo and Meghan Whitmer hold power over no one. </p>
<p>A better world is one in which China and the pharmaceutical industry cannot capture a global organization and task them with carrying their water. </p>
<p>Join us in the fight for a better world, it may seem hopeless today and I can't promise you that we will win... But I can promise you I won't stop fighting, please don't stop yourself.</p>

        <p>People spend years+ mourning over an ex girlfriend or maybe even a dead family member. We all lose chunks of our lives. It’s never fair, and yeah his and our sadness is valid for many reasons, but we should try to stay optimistic.</p>

        <p>Your feelings are perfectly normal for a person your age, my advice is get off  social media and internet and learn to love a new hobby that you can do during this clown world era we are living in, read some books, take up another instrument, hiking, biking, literally anything other than being online.</p>
<p>Also don't let your parents not let you not be emotional, my parents did that shit and it was real messed up</p>

        <p>I have a 16 year old in your situation. Outside of her required daily chores and reading, last semester I allowed her to flake on school and stay in bed. Sometimes you just need to curl up in a little ball and cry it out. So she got really depressed for awhile. It was sad to see but I’m depressed too so I understand. </p>
<p>Eventually she went from depressed to bored. She asked me for some money to start a new hobby (sewing/designing clothes). Usually I have her earn the money for this kind of thing, but this time I basically just threw money at her, because I knew that it was a hobby she could do indoors and it also has earning potential down the line. </p>
<p>Now she’s making lots of clothes and bags and yeah she’s still miserable (hobbies don’t solve everything), but she’s able to get out of her head for a little while each day, and that’s not nothing. </p>
<p>We’re all at our lowest point right now, and as long as you’re not contemplating hurting yourself my advice is stay in bed until you feel ready to try something new.  I get that what you love isn’t available but you’ll have to get curious about something else if you want to survive all this BS. </p>
<p>Also, you’re 17. Old enough to start soothing yourself. I’m sorry your mom hasn’t been there for you but you can take care of yourself at this age, and the more you help yourself (and not expect others to make you feel better), the better your life will be as a teenager and beyond. What can you do right now to make yourself feel better? A walk? Music? A book? You know yourself so you know the answer better than me. Don’t  give up on yourself just because the world has gone to hell. I know you’re better than that, and I know you’ll get through this.</p>

        <p>I was a high schooler who had their future robbed from them as well. Everything I ever dreamed of doing was taken from me. It was <em>unbelievably</em> painful, but in the end it spared me from a multitude of horrible things that I didn't know to watch out for (student loan debt, college brainwashing, basing self-worth on status/achievement, the list goes on). It was like someone stole my ticket to the Titanic. Devastating, but...</p>
<p>There's a good chance your life isn't going to look like what you thought it would. Mourn what you've lost (it's ok to mourn. Take as much time as you need). Do what you can to make it through every day. It's going to be difficult, but that's why we don't have to do it alone. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms+34%3A4-10&amp;version=NKJV">I wouldn't be writing this to you if we had to do it alone.</a></p>

        <p>First of all, dont listen to the "anti doomers" who say things are ruined forever and will never be good again. These people exist on either side. Its not true. There is a definite time limit to how long society can be shut down for, and right now we are testing that time limit. But it will not be forever. </p>
<p>You seem like a high achiever. I was a high achiever in high school too--AP student, swim team, language clubs, academic bowl team, etc. I cant speak for you, but in troubled times, especially if there isnt a lot of tangible adult support, I think we tend to cling to those things. Its the familiar, and things at which we excel, that help us cope. My dad died in high school and after a lot of dysfunctional coping, I graduated with a 4.8  gpa (weighted from AP) and had become a really solid competitive swimmer. Those things became my healthy coping. </p>
<p>Those things have been taken from you, along with the things you mentioned like color guard and competitions that you have been looking forward to for years. Regarding those things specifically, my advice is: if you have a teacher or counselor who you can contact sometime, try to rea ch out to them and tell them your feelings and concerns. It is very likely they will say they cant say how things will turn out. But they might also be able to give you an idea of what is being discussed from the faculty side of it. Hopefully there is someone on the students' side who knows how much these activities mean to everyone. Usually there is. </p>
<p>Considering how involved you are, there's really no substitute for that life and I wont pretend there is. I agree with other commenters who have said to find a hobby or rediscover one you used to have and maybe have set aside due to your high-achieverness in high school. I wanted to add some more options too though, that I had mentioned to another high schooler yesterday--</p>
<p>Depending on what your situation is for college, etc., you can start studying to take <a href="https://clep.collegeboard.org/exams">CLEP tests</a> for college credit. Not sure where they are doing test centers these days, but you literally just study for them, take the test (usually under $100) and its pass/fail. Looks like an AP test or something on your college transcript where it give you the credit hours but doesnt affect GPA, and they are much easier than AP tests, and most dont have a writing section. I took them for Developmental Psych and American Federal Government. Saved me probably $1000 and that amount of time in college to take classes I actually wanted/needed for my degrees. For you, I'd just say be careful because if you have tons of AP credits, you just want to be sure not to test out of more than half of the credits you need to graduate from an institution (not the easiest to do but for a determined person I guess itd be possible). I also want to mention these from the standpoint of, its almost like a "scholarship" but better because its saved you that big chunk of money, but it also saved you the time that you could use on a fun elective or even just have a lighter load for 1 or 2 semesters. Or graduate a year early like I did for my bachelors degree. </p>
<p>All this to say, it may feel like you are on hold, but you arent! It would have been very hard for me to push forward when I didnt feel like I was "competing" with my fellow students. But maybe if you frame it in the sense of making/saving money for college, you might feel more like working on it. </p>
<p>Also consider getting a job, perhaps as a contact tracer. Trying to keep working toward something and/or making some money right now makes a big difference. </p>
<p>Happy to answer questions about either of these things. Your life doesnt have to be at a standstill right now (I tell myself) :)</p>

        <p>I am so sorry you are feeling so low. You are not alone. Reading this tore into my already raw heart. I am a lot older than you and finding it very hard to cope so I can’t imagine how you must feel. I think back to when I was 17. All I can say is this too will pass. I agree with what some others here have said. Limit going on social media. I know that’s hard but I am convinced too much social media is not good for any of us tbh.  Try do something that you enjoy each day. Literally take each day as it comes. Get through each day and think about the next day and doing an enjoyable thing then. When I am stressed I cook. Try and find others you can meet up with. I live in a pretty remote area in the hi desert in California, although I am a Brit!  We are under another lockdown but my friends for the most part try to go on with our lives, we see each other. We watch movies together. We shop together. Sorry but no government is telling me who I can see and where I can go!!! I am pretty sure you will find others who feel as you do. Reach out!  Don’t expect everyone to want to do stuff, but it only takes one!! Good luck. Sending you a hug. Yes. A hug. Fuck social distancing!  And for what it’s worth, happy birthday for the 28th. You may not be able to celebrate exactly as you would like this birthday but I promise you, your next birthday will be fabulous. I know it!</p>

        <p>Just a year older than you. I understand your pain. It also seemed like I will have no prom and the activities  that follow so I was really depressed on missing out. Also I lost my last 2 months od school, the ones where you are like gods and just do stupid shit.But more and more people with authority started to see the truth and everything was eventually opened so I had prom, delayed and half-assed, but had the important bits. </p>
<p>To vent out your anger make some noise on social media. During lockdown I wrote couple posts on FB on how this all is bullshit, how much we are being lied to,cited statistics, even insulted health officials. And people liked them.</p>

        <p>My daughter is going into her senior year. Everything she enjoyed has been ruined. She spent $450 on a prom dress from her own money right before the lockdown and then prom was canceled last year. No choir concerts or competitions. No school events. No camps. No senior trip. They're trying to get sports back this year but with no crowd. Masks at school, plexiglass, sanitizers. It's awful. At least they get to go back in person as far as we know. My niece is supposed to be a freshman this year and they're starting their school year with elearning.</p>
<p>Almost all they do now is go party at people's houses and I just let her do whatever because she has nothing else anymore. As long as she doesn't drive under the influence or ride with people who aren't sober or get arrested. </p>
<p>I feel sorry for them because the next few years should be the most fun and carefree time in their lives and it's being taken away. I wish I knew what you could do, but I can't even tell my own daughter that because I don't know when this is going to end. We're just trying to go around the rules and do the most normal things that we can right now.</p>
<p>I don't know you but as a parent with a kid who is around the same age, I see what you're going through. You matter and I, some random mom on the internet, would care if you died because of this. You have every right to be sad and to mourn the loss of everything you were looking forward to and be angry at everything that has been taken from you.</p>

        <p>What timing, I was just thinking of this last night when looking at the latest from DCI and with BOA cancelling their season as well. Music programs were a huge part of my high school experience and transformed who I was before going to college. I thought back to all the achievements our team made and what it would be like if they were just indefinitely taken away. You can rebuild your career, but you can't get back those school years in your development.</p>
<p>Sounds like you are self-aware enough to be OK. But it does suck, to avoid a risk that is virtually 0 for young people.</p>
<p>EDIT -</p>
<p>It's especially hard at your age because 2 years out of 18 (and maybe &lt;10 of them actually "thinking" for yourself) is a huge portion of your life. But time will pass and this will go away, and this will seem like a small blip in hindsight. You will continue having ups and downs and so everything becomes less dramatic with experience. Hang in there, things get better as you get to college and beyond, despite everyone saying they miss their HS days.</p>

        <p>I’m so sorry for you. I feel terrible that you were deprived of all of those experiences. High school, graduation, and starting college are all coming of age experiences that deserve to be treasured. You are not shallow for mourning them.</p>
<p>I know it doesn’t sound like much, but as a person older than you, I’ve come to find that the sun will always rise after the darkest part of the night. I’d be lying if I said I knew what our world will look like in a year, but it will definitely be brighter with you in it. Please don’t give up. You have so much ahead of you to enjoy. It will return, although when, I can’t say. Your peers are the future and I don’t believe everyone will just roll over and accept this.</p>

        <p>I don't know what to say other than hang in there.  I had to miss some football in high school because of injury and that was super devastating and made me depressed even though it was a completely reasonable and normal outcome.
I can't imagine the sadness and anger of my season getting taken away for reasons that seemed unfair.</p>
<p>Anyways, hopefully things will become normal in time for you to do college because that should hold even better opportunities than high school.</p>
