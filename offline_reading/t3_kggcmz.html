    <strong>FOIs reveal that health/science institutions around the world have no record of SARS-COV-2 isolation/purification, anywhere, ever!!!</strong>
    <p><p>THEY WANTED THE GREAT RESET, THEY'RE GETTING THE GREAT AWAKENING...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fluoridefreepeel.ca/fois-reveal-that-health-science-institutions-around-the-world-have-no-record-of-sars-cov-2-isolation-purification/">https://www.fluoridefreepeel.ca/fois-reveal-that-health-science-institutions-around-the-world-have-no-record-of-sars-cov-2-isolation-purification/</a> </p>
<p>A colleague in New Zealand (<a href="https://thevirushoax.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/VIRUS/pages/44630017/University+of+Otago+s+Fake+Isolation+Process"><strong>Michael S.</strong></a>) and I (CM) have been submitting Freedom of Information requests to various institutions around the world seeking records that describe the isolation of a SARS-COV-2 virus from any unadulterated sample taken from a diseased patient. </p>
<p>Our requests have <strong>not</strong> been limited to records of isolation performed by the respective institution, or limited to records authored by the respective institution, rather they were open to any records describing “COVID-19 virus” isolation performed by anyone, ever, anywhere on the planet.</p>
<p>She emails almost every major research institution in the world and shows the emailed responses... Nobody can produce anything of as December 16th 2020, this fraud doesn't even exist in the first place. It seems it can't even be proved by any health department in the world that covid exists.</p>
<p>Some of us knew since April-May that this was a manufactured crisis, and here is the proof... Surely if covid did indeed exist, the world would of had an isolated or purified sample by now. It started in November 2019 in Wuhan, over a year later still no real sample of the "virus"?</p></p>

        <p>&rt;And yes, we are aware of the many publications wherein authors claim to have “isolated the virus”. We’ve looked at numerous such studies and have yet to see one where they actually did so </p>
<p>How would you know if they did or not? As private orgs, journals are rarely subject to FOI laws.</p>

        <p>Agreed on that. Sorry: SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated.</p>

<p><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0516_article">https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0516_article</a> </p>
<p>The purpose of the article was for a group of about 20 virologists to describe the state of the science of the isolation, purification and biological characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus, and to share this information with other scientists for their own research. A thorough and careful reading of this important paper reveals some shocking findings.</p>
<p>First, in the section titled “Whole Genome Sequencing,” we find that rather than having isolated the virus and sequencing the genome from end to end, that the CDC “designed 37 pairs of nested PCRs spanning the genome on the basis of the coronavirus reference sequence (GenBank accession no. NC045512).”</p>
<p><strong>To me, this computer-generation step constitutes scientific fraud.</strong> Here is an equivalency: A group of researchers claim to have found a unicorn because they found a piece of a hoof, a hair from a tail, and a snippet of a horn. They then add that information into a computer and program it to re-create the unicorn, and they then claim this computer re-creation is the real unicorn. Of course, they had never actually seen a unicorn so could not possibly have examined its genetic makeup to compare their samples with the actual unicorn’s hair, hooves and horn.</p>
<p>The researchers claim they decided which is the real genome of SARS-CoV-2 by “consensus,” sort of like a vote. Again, different computer programs will come up with different versions of the imaginary “unicorn,” so they come together as a group and decide which is the real  imaginary unicorn.</p>

        <p>I also read somewhere that the genome they are saying is sars cov2 is actually the genome for cov1 from the early 00’s. Either way it’s a simple cold</p>

        <p>'COV1 from the early 00's' was the O.G. SARS, a much, much deadlier virus.</p>

        <p>how much deadlier? what was the death toll? </p>
<p>did they change the rules for assigning c.o.d. like they did for the 'covid/sars2'?</p>
<p>did they use rt pcr lab technique ramped up to 47 cycles that doesn't even look for detect any virus  as a 'test'?</p>
