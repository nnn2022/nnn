    <strong>Immunicompromised person somewhat against vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>Update for those who read this: received by call my invite dor the vaccine. Not by my Primary care physician , but by a different doctor in the same physician's branch. 
The lady on the phone just said that 'I was put on the list', she didn't know my situation at all, and both my specialist were unaware of this. 
As for given information I got afterwards by my specialist of this vaccine to my situation, the most I got of info was 'it's best that you take it' and 'a viral infection could do serious damage cause of your conditions', but also that I didn't have to worry about about my immune system as long as I'm healthy by my new standards. 
Btw they are still discussing and sending me to new specialists, to to explain, inform and get as much intel as possible on the best treatment possible since there's little to none study's done on my somewhat unique case </p>
<p>This contrast is too enormous to be left unquestioned and followed blindly. </p>
<p>Original post:</p>
<p>So long story short - during first lockdown when nothing was allowed, I stayed at home to finnish my degree, no reason to outside (because dangerous!!!), afraid to see my friends, etc(like the believer I was). It was one of the most depressing times I have been through, staring at indoor walls all day. 
In that time I have been diagnosed with 2 chronic auto-immunes diseases(weeks apart), non-life threatening, just the possible chance at losing a life I call worhty.</p>
<p>In some way I blame the poor mental state I was in, I do not believe that physical and mental health are two separate things. But no one knows what triggered them. </p>
<p>My specialists are to this day still debating/looking into what medications for those conditions are best, without interfering with each other. Medications that are quite new, +/- 2years in the running, but have have been greatly researched beforehand. Unfortunately not yet combined with these 2 conditions together. As I see my doctors working their asses of to provided the best solutions so that I can live my life the way I have it now, and have lived it so far. 
I have trust in these medications and these doctors</p>
<p>As to the vaccine, which has not been tested before, they are now presenting it to people, as the testing fase. We know of certain immediate side-effects, but none in the long run, simply because we are not there yet. As it seems forced, graphs are being played with, reality is distorted. 
I have no trust in what seems to be a political disease. </p>
<p>The difference in approach to the medication/vaccin to my situation and corona is enormous, which is why to this day I stand somewhat opposed, both to the vaccine for me and for a healthy person.</p>
<p>My immune system is compromised, yet I am and feel healthy. If in the end, when the public testing is finished (in 2023, I think) the vaccine is ready, and if at that point Covid is still a huge problem, I will consider it, if proposed by my specialist.</p>
<p>The chance of the 2 'if's' happening seems rather small. But I am curious to what similar and fair reasoning minds think/sugest/propose</p></p>
