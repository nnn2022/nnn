    <strong>Anyone else here because of vaccine adverse effects? I was stupid enough to get both shots and my ears have been ringing non stop since the first shot. I've also had horrible nerve pain in my ears after the second shot.</strong>
    <p><p>The medical system gives no fucks about adverse reactions. I got permanent 24/7 tinnitus after the first shot and I got severe hyperacusis for 3 months after my second shot. A falling pencil felt like a stab in my ears. Sound would torture me and silence continues to torture me with tinnitus. The hyperacusis is bearable now but it's still really scary. Take at your own risk. Some people have had worse ear related long-term symptoms from the vaccine. They were Covid positive and the vaccine made it worse. No one will believe you or pay your bills for your adverse reactions and you will be called a stupid anti vaxxer for wishing they did more research before forcing you to take it. It’s your call, at your own risk. You’ll get the shot and no doctor will give a fuck about what comes after. I’ve been in a real dark place because of the vax. And I’ve taken both my shots so it’s fucked up they call us anti vaxxers when we are victims and willingly took the shots. They never believe you and tell you its all in your head, it’s so humiliating and messed up. I've had lots of vaccines all my life and none of them even poisoned me like this shit. Don't let any of your friends or family guilt you or take your choice. And definitely don't let the government force you to take an experimental vaccine</p></p>

        <p>Tinnitus is a common side effect.
I was not as lucky me get myocarditis and a blot clot in my leg as a bad reaction.
Have been advocating against this shit since I was hospitalised because of it</p>

        <p>I also have hyperacusis and its a nightmare. I would get nerve pain from people talking loudly or slamming tables. I feel really bad for your blood clot. Fuck the government for peddling this toxic waste. The most fucked up part is if you die in a crash and are covid positive, it's a covid death. But you die from the vaccine and they'll make an excuse to rule it out</p>

        <p>Oh man. I’m so sorry to hear that. I’ve known people who got hit hard by it. In fact more people than I know who were hospitalized from Covid, which is weird because they say side effects are more rare than hospitalization. I’ve known quite a few people who have had Covid, too. </p>
<p>There’s very few people I can talk to about it too. No one believes me and I started grabbing posts before they get censored. This stuff is weird. </p>
<p>Is there any treatment for myocarditis? There are docs out there who are specializing in vaccine damage, they might be able to help.</p>

        <p>Have been taking oral medication and have done a few anti inflammatory drips.
So far they have given some relief but it keeps coming back. Heart feels like it’s constantly pushing out of my chest and I struggle for breath most of the time.

        <p>Yeah. You gotta scrub out those bad proteins. See if you can get ivermectin for it. Charles Hoffe and some other docs have been treating people with vaccine damage. Don’t know the other names though off hand.</p>
<p>Not sure if it would help, but curcumin is an amazing, natural and safe anti-inflammatory. I used to do 3G a day for a few years for an auto immune issue I had. That and a few other things helped knock it out. </p>
<p>That is rough. Good luck and hopefully we can finally break the dam in this and get you and others proper care once this all gets out there.</p>

        <p>it’s interesting when they call those of us who don’t want the vaccine selfish. </p>
<p>if i’m so selfish, surely i would have something to gain from not taking the vaccine… i’ve seen them say we just decline the vax solely because we “want to own the libs.” like are you fucking kidding me? </p>
<p>what reason does anyone have for not wanting to take the vaccine besides being afraid of their health being compromised? i haven’t decided against it because i want to own fucking liberals. i’m a leftist and a feminist. is it selfish of me, then, to want to protect my own well being and prevent this happening to me??? </p>
<p>the companies won’t take liability, the government won’t take liability, health insurance companies will find a way out of it, and a lot of us don’t even <em>have</em> insurance because of big pharma scamming us to that effect too. </p>
<p>i’m just fucking pissed off reading this, because people like you are suffering and these absolutely asinine people (doctors, society, employers, the government) are pretending it isn’t happening. that’s what’s going to happen to the rest of us when we are eventually forced into taking it. </p>
<p>it’s not that i’m selfish because i just want to feel smart and “own liberals” (because seriously, what the fuck sense does that even make?) honestly, i’m just as confused as anybody else and i’m not the smartest person… but i <em>am</em> selfish about my health and i have every right to be. reading stories like yours, as sad as they are, remind me not to give in to this shit. </p>
<p>i’m really sorry that this happened to you, and i hope you get to feeling better or miraculously find a doctor who will actually help you. this is absolutely horrific and the fact that we are being forced to take these vaccines and then expected to handle all the side effects on our own afterwards is fucking disgusting. this is a crime against humanity.</p>

        <p>I'm trying to make a subreddit but it won't let me. They probably flag certain words now. I swear it's borderline illegal to talk about vaccine symptoms. The censorship is amazing. I just saw a post about some other guy who said that a lot of people who got bad adverse reactions in the studies were unblinded in the trial and they didn't count them in the statistics.</p>

        <p>I’m so sorry that you are going through all this BS. I don’t know what could help you from a medical standpoint but I hope you find relief soon. There is a supplement called NAC that has been said to help people with their tinnitus, it could be worth looking into: https://www.tinnitusformula.com/library/nac-for-tinnitus-and-your-health/</p>
<p>It’s harder to find lately for some reason but I’m pretty sure they still sell it on iHerb.</p>

        <p>People have called me selfish, too. I did countless hours of research on this and the big red flag was that it doesn’t stop transmission. I knew that months ago and kept asking people why media and the gov is telling people that it did. They would tell me, “because it stops the virus.”</p>
<p>I would reply, “no, it is 95% effective at preventing Covid-19 syndrome. They never said it stops you from getting SARS-CoV-2, the virus.” They would then go in a parrot loop.</p>
<p>Part of the reason I was hesitant was because I didn’t want to become an asymptomatic carrier, which I’m very health conscious and have a good chance to be. I’d rather take on the risk of getting symptoms because I’m more likely to survive it than others and would be responsible and isolate. I’d infect more people if I was more likely to be asymptomatic.</p>
<p>I guess that makes me selfish because I did my homework instead of cheating off a TV doctor.</p>

        <p>So sorry to hear that. I hope you feel better sooner rather than later. It's a fucked up situation for sure, one that I've also been guilted into by people I look up to. Such people have even claimed to have suffered a heavy flu and fever for two weeks immediately following, yet still say "At least it wasn't Covid" because they buy the propaganda without question. </p>
<p>But it's never been about Covid or personal safety, yours and thousands of others who have experienced the other side of the vaccine can attest to that. It's been political since the beginning.</p>

        <p>Don’t know what to say to you OP, they are so adamant that the vaccine is safe and effective that I doubt they’ll ever put any effort into helping those who have been damaged by it and rather you just be swept under a rug somewhere.  Although what your experiencing could be damage to the ear itself or neurological I don’t know if it could be repaired or heal itself.  You could try Ivermectin or other protease inhibitor if the damage is caused by lingering spike proteins in monocytes, but that’s a treatment you’d need to discuss with a willing medical practitioner.</p>

        <p>Really sorry to hear that. It's a common axiom among vaccine safety advocates that pharma itself is the biggest culprit in the rise of the antivaxx movement, because most of these people used to trust vaccines but got burned. Must be surreal, taking the shots and being considered antivaxx anyway. Hope it gets better for you</p>

        <p>I’m sorry OP :( Tinnitus is no fucking joke. I’ve had it for years due to some poor choices and a love for deep bass concerts, subwoofers, home audio etc. it’s absolutely a huge quality of life impact and I’m sorry you’re going through that. </p>
<p>A helpful bit of advice - check out white noise apps like rain rain. It can be a lifesaver on nights when you’re really suffering. Personally I just sleep with the tv on and have for about 10 years.</p>

        <p>I hope you get better! Don't forget, that the body has an amazing capability to detox, take it easy and focus on your healing.
Interestingly, I also know about 2 people who started to have ear-related issues after the second shot. They both have ear pain, feel very weak and extremely dizzy and can't do physical work since. According to the GP this is no urgent issue so they have to wait almost a month for an ophthalmologist... The funny part is that they took the shots because their nurses unofficially 'threatened' them that they might wont get their regular treatments if they don't get vxd. Madness.</p>
