    <strong>The "New Puritanism" And Corona - Let's Dig Deeper</strong>
    <p><p>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/j6c3h2/covid_will_pass_but_the_precedent_has_been_set/">this thread</a>, a really interesting side discussion started about the relationship between Corona-Fascism and other "isms". As a starting point, I'd like to use this comment I left this morning: </p>
<p>&rt;The  "New Puritanism" is a big tent - I would say it includes Green-ism,  Safety-ism, "Equalism", Militant Feminism, and "Communitarianism" as a  baseline. Most other "isms" (including Corona-Fascism) are offshoots or  variations of these main strains.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;It's  all a messianic movement which has grown up in the absence of faith -  faith that once was sublimated in one or all of: religion, the State,  our public institutions, humanity.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Nothing  exists in a vacuum, including mankind. As we have foolishly torn down  our old institutions of faith, other, more "personal", more extreme,  more fanatical versions have taken their place.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;All  faiths have the Godhead, Saints, Martyrs, Sinners, and "the Other" -  the root of all evil. In the current climate of fanaticism (partly  brought on because many of the faithful, deep down, have lingering  doubts about their "Gods"), those of us who resist the "isms" are  demons, monsters, not human. We must be destroyed. Hence the venom  directed against us from the pulpits of social media. Once we were  dragged to the scaffold - now we are doxxed, "cancelled", and torn to  pieces by the virtual mob.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;It is only a matter of time before the purges move once again from the virtual, to the real.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The  present Circus of Corona, combined hand in hand with the Cult of Green,  and the Cult of Western Guilt, resembles nothing as much as  Robespierre's absurd "Cult of the Supreme Being", which was another  ersatz replacement for the stripping away of older institutions and  beliefs.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<em>Virtue is the order of the day, Citizen - backed by Terror.</em><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;We all know how that worked out.</p>
<p>I'm hoping some of the previous contributors might like to continue the discussion. Any takers?</p></p>

        <p>I'll just say this...</p>
<p>This whole fiasco, and even before this, has proven that humans will become obsessive and fanatical over anything. Whether it's religion or science, sports or the arts, or specific entities like a significant other or a car or a fandom or whatever. Oh, and people are very easily manipulated, especially by the things they, in turn, obsess over.</p>

        <p>Very true.</p>
<p>What's interesting is that all the panaceas that were supposed to "fix" these traits, have all, in the long run, failed.</p>
<p>Better education, better living standards, more leisure, more input into decisions worked for a while, but only in a society, as John Adams stated, that was "moral and God-fearing".</p>
<p>Now that these moorings are gone, the brief, sunny period of liberty and plenty we enjoyed (and threw away) is ending.</p>
<p>I think we are headed back to a more high-tech version of Medieval feudalism - except our new overlords will have power over the serfs such as nobles and kings only dreamed of.</p>

        <p>How many of these proposed solutions were more manipulations from the offset? Even if some people had good intentions there are always others with maybe un-stated goals. Maybe they sometimes write what their goals were later in life, in books no-one will ever read anyway.</p>

        <p>I'll check it out.</p>
<p>I also see this virus-panic as part of the ongoing societal slide towards anarcho-tyranny. Look at what's been coming down since it started:</p>
<ul>
<li>BLM riots, looting, and property destruction get a pass. Other events, especially anti-lockdown protests, and participants are beaten and arrested.</li>
<li>Anti-maskers are threatened with jail. Meanwhile, we have emptied the jails of pedophiles, thieves, drug dealers, and gang members - "for their own safety".</li>
<li>Masks used to be a symbol of criminality and anarchy - now they are normalized.</li>
<li>Travel and movement are restricted - unless you are a celebrity, politician, or a member of the super-rich.</li>
<li>Knowingly giving someone AIDS is no longer a felony, but you can be locked up for "breaking quarantine/isolation", even if you aren't sick.</li>
<li>Governments use this scamdemic every day to make decisions that destroy our lives with no transparency or accountability, but you and I are watched by drones and subjected to digital surveillance aka "contact tracing".</li>
</ul>
<p>The end game here is to create a society so chaotic, so lawless, so dangerous, that the normies will beg for any tyrant that promises to "make it all better".</p>

        <p>The first step to communism is anarchy... Destroy to the system then promise utopia, promote the fourth industrial revolution and the " green " economic plans across the world as the only solution to this economic and climate " emergency " crisis we are in... They will unlock 20 Trillion USD + equivalent in pension fund money globally, there will be an intense flow of money and inflation in advanced economies which will boom the global economy for a few years, then economic reality of socialism and communism will start to appear once the sugar high from insane stimulus comes to an end...</p>
<p>Then comes the depopulation phase, once the system of maximum dependence on the state has been achieved. Can you imagine by 2030 with automation and general AI making up 20-25 % of the global workforce? The world will still turn and function but a shitload of people will be jobless and utterly dependent on governments.</p>
<p>Look into the deep state and their eugenics ideology, that is the prime reason for everything happening, the entire covid narrative is to usher in the era of government dependence and ultimately, depopulation...</p>

<p><a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/now-is-the-time-for-a-great-reset/">https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/now-is-the-time-for-a-great-reset/</a></p>
<p>Article written by Klaus schwab about the great reset of capitalism and the " green " industrial revolution, and how the government will be able to acquire public or private companies, putting government reps on public boards ( communism style ) and just str8 non sense. Klaus schwab is the founder of Davos and WEF, listed as top 50 most powerful men in the world in forbes. If he's pushing this shit with a bunch of billionaires, you know they are dead serious about it.</p>
<p>This is an interview with Mark Crispin Miller, Professor at NYU on propaganda and media studies. Hour and 42 minutes long, it's in my opinion the best talking context of what is currently going on, the purge on critical thinkers in US academia, eugenics and the green movement are tied together, covid hoax, so many subjects I believe he's exactly on the money... He knows and mentions literally everything, smoke some purple kush tonight and enjoy the whole conversation. He mentions the great reset article and so many others, I was shocked by this coming from a NYU Professor, but he's getting fired and on his way out, so he's going out Libertarian style...</p>

        <p>It's good that you brought economics into the discussion. It seldom gets the tie-in to current events it deserves.</p>
<p>Most people have zero understanding of basic economics, or the forces at play behind the scenes - and our masters like it that way.</p>
<p>In our previous "industrial revolutions" you could make the argument that after a period of initial turmoil and upheaval, everyone benefited.</p>
<p>- The move from nomadic hunting to static, agricultural societies freed up members of the collective to develop the seeds of art, religion, writing, science, and philosophy - which are impossibilities when the sole focus of the group is to avoid starvation.</p>
<p>- The move from agriculture to industry produced the chemicals, medicines, consumer products, and transportation modes that enabled us to exploit the world more efficiently, rapidly expand human knowledge and lifespan, and set the stage for ideas of personal liberty, human rights, and a middle class.</p>
<p>This, I would argue, reached its zenith in postwar America. Then things started to change.</p>
<p>- The move from industry to a computer based "information economy has caused the first cracks in the illusion of progress. "More efficient" has meant fewer jobs, and the creation of a government dependent underclass. It has meant the stagnation of real-world wages, and less time for leisure and reflection. It has created a bloated class of "intellectuals" who know and understand nothing - but are sure they know what is best for all of us.</p>
<p>- Now, as we transition to "Green" economies, the forces unleashed in the computer/information age economy phase will increase exponentially. Who will buy the goods the robots produce, if most people now have no job? Where will the tax base come from to keep our bloated entitlement programs afloat? How will we fund our already decaying infrastructure? What will we do with the massive class of "sans-culottes" we are creating?</p>
<p>At some point, one might expect someone to apply the brakes to this, but it isn't happening. Why?</p>
<p><em>Simple. Ask "Cui Bono?"</em></p>
<p>The answer is simple - the same transnational globalist classes that have benefited from every transformation we have undergone.</p>
<p>- In the past, it was to their benefit to have vast armies of labour. Now it isn't.</p>
<p>- In the past, it was to their benefit to ensure that the serfs had homes, wages, and leisure. Now it isn't.</p>
<p>- In the past, it was to their benefit to allow the illusion of democracy. Now it isn't.</p>
<p>It's time for the Great Reset. We will be marched there under the twin banners of Corona and Green - most of us cheering as we go.</p>
<p><em>We are obsolete. Obsolete things are disposed of. It's coming.</em></p>

        <p>I did a thread on the new propaganda methods going forward with the deep state... Leading the public into emergency mode was written by Dr Margaret Salamon, she introduces the concept of " emergency " mode and doesn't even try to hide that it's manipulation... It's a way to promote " change " through fear, they started it in 2016 with the climate change movement and the " green " deals.</p>
<p>The same kind of propaganda using " emergency " came with the covid hoax as well, they are using the same formula... Eugenics and the depopulation agenda, which is the principle ideology of the global deep state, wear the "green " mantle now. Eugenics and the climate change movement is the same group pulling the strings, exact same propaganda in the climate sphere as the covid sphere. Act now save lives, we're all in this together, stay alert stay safe, all these slogans to promote the " emergency " at hand.</p>
<p>Here is the thread I did on the propaganda subject, good read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/j3hkfo/leading_the_public_into_emergency_mode/">https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/j3hkfo/leading_the_public_into_emergency_mode/</a> </p>
<p>She writes: the goal of the climate movement must be to lead the public out of " normal " mode and into emergency mode. This has huge implications for the climate movement’s  communication style, advocacy and strategy. Because emergency mode is contagious, the best strategy is for climate activists and organizations to go into emergency mode themselves, and communicate about the climate emergency, the need for emergency mobilization, and the fact that they are in emergency mode,as clearly and emphatically as possible.</p>
<p>The crux of the strategy document, Leading the Public into Emergency Mode: A New Strategy for the Climate Movement, is that citizens must first face, then accept that there is a life-threatening emergency in order to go into the necessary emergency mode. Once triggered, this enables the deployment of “ a huge amount of resources toward solving the crisis ” which would quickly become the clear, top priority for society.</p>
