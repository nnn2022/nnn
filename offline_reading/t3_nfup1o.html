    <strong>Questions</strong>
    <p><p>Keep in mind as you read this I donâ€™t have regular tv.  Everything coming in is tightly controlled because propaganda irritates me.  Anyway I talked to my father yesterday.   News constantly.  Oddly not a peep about the virus or even the vaccine.  He voted for Trump last year.  Now heâ€™s calling him an insane criminal and started talking about everyone being so divided he is certain Civil War is coming.   I was THOROUGHLY expecting vaccine questions and or demands.  (For those curious,  Iâ€™m not certain of any political ideologies.  If I were guessing I would guess he votes as my grandfather tells him too.) He was deep into his mask though.  Wore it everywhere and has been self isolated for over a year.  (Like his father.) Iâ€™m not sure whatâ€™s going on but he was...  different than normal.  Itâ€™s like COVID disappeared overnight for him and something weirder showed up in its place.  I almost prefer the virtue signaling to the paranoia.  And the 180 on Biden is just plain odd.</p></p>

        <p>My father was all for Trump last year but got the vax this year. Now he wants me to get the Vax because he caught COVID this year but didn't have health complications as a result. This is the same man that introduced me to smoking, alcohol, pot and pornography (three of which I still struggle with to this day). If I haven't learned by now that he is not the best person to listen to, will I ever?</p>
<p>His friend who was as equally "Trump" as him before the election, doesn't want me to bring up the truth about the vaccine while I am staying with him. As far as I am concerned, they are all braindead sheep that will do whatever their TV tells them!</p>

        <p>Thatâ€™s the part that stumps me!  Him going on about the vaccine or whatever the tv is tossing at him is what I expected!  Itâ€™s his NORM.  Itâ€™s like heâ€™s on a new tv channel entirely and whoever is in charge of it is out to take all his money.  (Via...  civil war).   I listened but it was confusing?    </p>
<p>However I now consider myself lucky my father didnâ€™t introduce me to pornography.  ðŸ˜¬</p>

        <p>Clarification on this:  He was talking a lot about a civil war but his actual concern seemed to revolve around his money just disappearing.   It was weird.  To me civil war evokes fear of death not just lost access to my bank account.</p>
