    <strong>Holding opening up the economy at gunpoint in Singapore</strong>
    <p><p>I honestly could not care less whether it's Phase 2 or 3. Because it just means that I don't need to use Trace together at all. And honestly, the increases in Phase 3 are laughable at best you'll still have to wear a mask and social distance. And glad to see that enough people just don't roll over. It's nothing to be getting excited over, it's just that you have to carry a tracking device on your phone or personally like a collar. </p>
<p>I mean, honestly speaking, there isn't much to get excited over about Phase 3, it is modest at best, and I'm delaying it as much as possible. </p>
<p>But at the same time, this is ramping up the propaganda to put the blame squarely on the other, the people who are using their common sense realizing that this modicum of increase isn't worth the loss of privacy even before the vaccine comes out and turning people to the people who don't take up and hence spoil it for the rest of us. </p>

        <p>Yes, they always do that. And then I found a major discrepancy when they had cited two different numbers. 50.8% for chiding the public and 60% when they won some competition for innovation. It's like they can't even get their story straight.</p>
