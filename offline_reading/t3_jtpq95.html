        <p>1) The 20% funding boost is for those covered by Medicare, not the entire population. This certainly inspired a few to jump on the money train. However, it could not possibly be in numbers large enough to make a difference in the current numbers.</p>
<p>2) We had an increase in excess deaths. More people died recently than usual. The numbers are returning to normal for regions first hit.</p>
<p>3) You have stage 4 lung cancer. I stab you in one of your lungs. The doctors may have been able to save you but complications with your cancer and current lung capicity cause you to die. Should your death be counted as a murder or a cancer death?</p>

<p>Well <em>neither</em> if the guy tests positive for Covid. Because then it was obviously the Covid that killed him.</p>

        <p>You miss that some people were trying to say that perfectly healthy 69 year olds like my mother who died from CoVid-19 did NOT die from CoVid-19 simply because they were slightly overweight or had slightly high blood pressure or treated high blood pressure.</p>
<p>Sorry: If under any other circumstances you would have lived to 85 without catching CoVid-19, you died because of CoVid-19. End of discussion.</p>

        <p>Well my uncle of 75yrs with a history of cancers and strokes <em>also</em> got covid. And he was fine. It was like a cold for him.  </p>
<p>However - He has had 3 strokes. His last was in January. We have honestly been expecting him to go any time. And so has he!  He could have a stroke any day of the week.  </p>
<p>When he got Covid that chance didnt <em>go down</em>. He could still have a stroke any day of the week. But that wouldnt mean it was because of the Covid, because he wasnt affected by it much.</p>
<p>So that is something to keep in mind, considering how much of this has played out in seniors environments. These environments are fulll of, literally, people who are about to die. Many of these people are, regretfully, already on a trajectory towards death. If Covid breaks out in their home, and they get it .. they are still on that trajectory.</p>

        <p>You have no way to know that you're totally not made up dead Mom would have lived to 85 if she didn't catch a virus with a 99.5% survival rate for her age range. She could just as easily been one of the many who die every year of flu, meningitis, pneumonia, food poisoning, lightning strikes, carbon monoxide poisoning, died with no appearant cause during sleep, sudden and aggressive cancer, aneurysms, ect.

        <p>I wonder what else could have possibly caused excess deaths... The Rona ~~lockdown induced suicides, overdoses, untreated heart attacks and strokes, loneliness fading deaths, untreated cancer, ect~~ is the only possible explanation.</p>
<p>Also, comparing someone getting stabbed in the lungs with catching a mild disease under natural circumstances and being so far gone that they die of a normal natural causes is hilarious.</p>

        <p>Of course its not the only possible explanation. We agree that all those things contributed.</p>
<p>Regardless of the immediate cause of death, other things can complicate care and increase the probability of death. That doesn't strike me as "far fetched".</p>

<li>Because private insurance pays for non Medicare patients</li>
<li>Also an interesting correlation <a href="https://www.hfma.org/topics/news/2020/06/110-000-medicare-beneficiaries-were-hospitalized-for-covid-19-by.html">https://www.hfma.org/topics/news/2020/06/110-000-medicare-beneficiaries-were-hospitalized-for-covid-19-by.html</a></li>
<li>Have you broken down the numbers of your excess deaths. I did which I analyzed two age groups, and will be tackling the others. The Over 65 age group is actually on pace to be less than annual averages. The 15 and younger ae actually on pace to to exceed annual averages tremendously adding 6 thousand to the 30,000 annual cases where only a handful are COVID..Lots of excess deaths in this group without and qualification.</li>
<li>Terrible reasoning. If this was the case then virtually no one would die from cancer and the deaths would be attributed to the conditions they succumbed to..Garden variety Pneumonia is a common one. Big difference Between assigning a natural cause to an unnatural cause and virus's. However, using you're own analogy and "logic"..If someone dies of cancer, and then you stab them in the lungs, what did they die of?</li>

        <p>Yes, of course. 18% of the population is in Medicare. Most old. </p>
<p>Do you believe an amount of doctors and administrators purposefully marked deaths as "covid" when it was not in fact covid?</p>
<p>If so, do you believe that number was large? 10%? 20%? 50%?</p>
<p>If so, do you believe this was done accidentally (through bad testing) or purposefully (free money grab)?</p>
