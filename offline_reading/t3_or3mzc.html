<title>The NSW government is trying to scare people out of sharing images of the Sydney protest. They are putting together a task force of detectives to prosecute anyone with footage of the event. Please help me show them how many fucks I actually give. FUCK THE AUSTRALIAN MINISTERS AND PM!</title>

        <p>Here's the full announcement for those of you wanting to see what pro-establoshment corporate tears look like. </p>
<p>https://youtu.be/ZTSsTiZ0JBs</p>
<p>Seriously, fuck this lot. Trying to compare themselves to the working class who have lost everything and don't have enough to feed their families. "We're all in this together, it's hard for all of us, the government is the one who will need to pay our way out of this crisis!" </p>
<p>The shitty nerve of this guy. The government ministers have received pay rises over the last 18 months while the working class are being told that it's too dangerous to work and pay their bills. Their ivory tower and communist schemes are funded 100% by the taxpayers and they're soiling themselves over the idea of the bottom class taking a piece of the pie. </p>
<p>I won't be afraid or silenced. Their resident bootlickers have heeded the call by doxxing and reporting anyone who was at the protest. We are in the process of organising a crowdfund campaign to fight them in the courts. </p>
<p>Don't be discouraged. You aren't alone.</p>

        <p>Mate you're so obsessed with people who disagree with you that you're plastering me all over other threads. It seems to be all you can talk about. I'm almost flattened by the derangement syndrome. Me and my opinions are living in your head rent free and you're calling other people deranged. </p>
<p>The irony really is baffling. I only hope that one day your intolerant and divisive views don't land you in serious fuck-up.</p>

        <p>Mate, the government don't want to scare anyone out of sharing images of the protests, they actively want you to, they have asked people to, it helps them identify and convict the people who attended. You're doing exactly what they want.</p>
