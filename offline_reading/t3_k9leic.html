        <p>They want to stop the rally on 12th by any means necessary, it will have over 1 million patriots and twice the proud boys as the last march, they want to avoid this at all costs and know it will make the news, they probably dont have enough antifa members to cause havoc as well, I see them locking everything down by Friday for sure.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2020/12/07/the-december-12-maga-rally-will-take-place-at-freedom-plaza-after-all/">So there will be something this weekend</a>.  That should be amusing.  I saw a bunch of them on the Metro last time they had something (I was coming through on unrelated business), and they were waving their signs in the stations and getting a little bit too close to the trains as they were coming into the stations.  They tend to forget that the locals tend to see zillions of protesters in downtown DC, and they also tend to not care what you're protesting just as long as they can still get where they're going.</p>
