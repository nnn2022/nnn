    <strong>I feel less insane now!</strong>
    <p><p>I’m so happy to have found this sub, it felt like the right time to make my first real in-depth post on Reddit...</p>
<p>I’ve started to feel like I’m taking crazy pills, questioning if I am just one of like three people in the world who has concerns about this whole situation (concerns not regarding the sickness itself, obviously). </p>
<p>I tend to eschew conspiracy theories, but I am certainly a skeptic by nature. It’s troubling to me how quickly everyone just seems to be totally ok with seemingly blindly giving everything up without a single question raised or thought to the future. </p>
<p>I also know that while I am skeptical about all of this, the people who are scared are as scared as I am skeptical, so I continue to try to retain an open mind on all fronts as well as some empathy for those people. The information we have the easiest access to is so garbled and alarmist, that I can’t really blame people for being scared. And I don’t feel like it’s worth it for me to argue with someone who is in full-on panic mode.</p>
<p>I couldn’t sleep last night and my mind was racing about all of this so I began a running stream-of-consciousness style document. It’s basically a bullet point list of things that don’t make sense to me about all of this and the contradictions in messaging I see when I read between the lines of the news. I’ve been adding to it every time I have a “wtf” moment and it helps me feel a little less crazy once I get it out of my head. 
Curious to know if anyone would be interested in looking at it and discussing? It certainly would feel nice to actually have some kind of actual discussion about oh, I don’t know, anything at all instead of a reactionary scream-fest.</p></p>

        <p>The problem is going back and forth between the doomer media outlets and voices of reason like this.</p>
<p>It's refreshing to see that in many places IRL people are going back to the old normal as much as possible.</p>
<p>It's funny watching Covid extremists scurry away in fear.</p>

        <p>Yes. I have a couple friends that I’ve seen in person (some adhering strictly to rules, others not), and there seems to be a light at the end of the interaction from them like, “oh, that wasn’t so bad and I don’t appear to be dying!” </p>
<p>Pretending like human interaction through screens is normal (contradiction noted!) and just the same as IRL seems to be really hurting the situation too.</p>

        <p>There are many contradictions and the narratives dont make sense. You're not alone. I'd be interested in your discussion document that you mention.</p>
<p>The thing I'm most interested right now is the manipulation of the raw statistics by the media. And then I start wondering what else has been manipulated and to what purpose. Most of all, why?</p>

        <p>I keep saying “why do they consistently only total cases?”  That’s not the true scope of this. Illinois here 94%of people who got it aha e recovered. 155,000 is the number always reported. (And going up by 800-1000 a day). Holy crap  tomorrow the doom and gloom will be reported as 156,000 illinoisians have it. In truth 145,000 have recovered!!!  That story isn’t told.</p>

        <p>I'm thinking of making a post on one of these subs about my (unproven) theories behind the narrative the MSM and the democrats have come up with. There's just so many things that seem too coincidental to be ignored, even if you look at what led up to the hysteria.</p>

        <p>Dude, I'm the living proof you aren't insane. I have had COVID-19 for a week (two weeks... who knows... the symptoms are <em>super</em> mild), same with my wife. I've seriously had much worse common colds. This is, no exaggeration, the most shameful gaslighting in human history.</p>

        <p>I hope you get all the way better soon! I have a friend who had it in March. She told me the symptoms would come and go over the entire month, and that they mainly made her feel like she was dealing with a month-long hangover.</p>
