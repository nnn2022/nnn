        <p>I would say bring on the hypocrisy, so people can see it. But sadly, they cannot. </p>
<p>The person who wrote the playbook on globalist subversion could get on TV and tell every single person how they do it, who is helping them, and how they achieve there goals. The useful idiots would call him a conspiracy theorist and try and cancel him, not even realizing they are using the system they were just told existed. </p>

        <p>And it was supposed to be a big year for us.  I was going to get back into club DJing which is my real love in life and take my wife on adventures she hasn't been able to experience.  Not only COVID but because I'm 'essential' I have to stick close to home in case I'm needed suddenly.  And it's all a bunch of bullshit.  I've said that there was something larger going on with this all along and people thought i was full of shit.  Oh well at least I still have $3400 free coming.  Nothing like getting a nice little tax 'refund' from time to time.</p>

        <p>dude i totally feel you.  i love music and club/festival connections as well.  I moved my family out to nyc for some new life experiences and covid came, and actually we had a cool ass time becoming really close and partying with people in our bldg once may came and there was a sense that it was winding down.  by summer cases and deaths were way down but masking insanity was starting to take off.  by august nyc was super safe and yet i kept hearing fauc-dog talking about 2021, and goggles, so we made the call to move back to our way less interesting, and super super uptight west coast liberal town, which still has a giant piece of driftwood up its ass about masking and covid.  dont know if we will ever be able to spend the effort moving to new york again, though i hope we will.  this hysteria cost me a year of my life, not to mention whatever fear and anger hormones do to the body.  total insanity drawn out over an unimaginably long time.</p>

        <p>Unlike most of these useful idiots, I never supported lockdowns, not even as a New Yorker 45 minutes from NYC. In early April when NY was facing almost 1k deaths a day, I was going on hikes in the state parks and delivering for Instacart. The most I’ve ever stayed home for and not left at all was four days. How do people put up with these rules for so long? I was hanging out with my friends at the Jersey Shore right after Memorial Day weekend.</p>

        <p>Not to mention the fact Pelosi stalled a second stimmy for 8 months and Republicans wanted $2k. Dems and RINOs said no. Trump tried to intervene. Nope, only $600. Now Biden wants to pass another stimulus with $2k. I bet this one will get passed through like a breeze. (Let's not worry about national debt or inflation either!)</p>

        <p>The vaccine is rolling out incredibly slowly. They don't suspect it will be ready for the general population until spring. On top of that, not everyone is taking it. If it were about a vaccine, these governors would be 1. Mentioning it in their reopening plans and 2. Waiting until most people are vaccinated. </p>

        <p>Explain South Korea, Australia, NZ among others then. Lockdowns don't work when idiot Americans refuse to follow the rules. They were never properly enforced either and many US states have idiots in government who are more interested in Freedumb than reality. Literally on this very subreddit there are hundreds of posts of people detailing how they're going to break the lockdown rules and then you say lockdowns don't work. idiot.</p>

<li>
<p>Australia and New Zealand are islands. Incomparable. And South Korea never had a complete lock down. So that wasn't a good point. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For every place you point to that "locked down successfully", I can point to a place that locked down and wasn't successful, or a place that didn't lock down and is ok. (If lockdowns work so well, why are New York and other places that lock down heavy doing just as bad or worse as places that don't lock down at all?) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The almighty WHO says lockdowns should NOT be primary defense against Covid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many, MANY people on this sub follow all the lockdown rules but they just don't agree with it. I wear the stupid mask everywhere I go in public- my disagreement with protocols doesn't mean I'm the reason they aren't working when I am still following them all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A plan based on 100% compliance to work, WILL NEVER WORK. If we live in a society where murder happens, we are also going to have people break lockdown. Rules and laws will never be followed 100% of the time- so if the only way for it to "work" is if everyone has to follow it, it was a shit plan to begin with. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>No need to respond further because I won't respond, waste of time...</p>

        <p>I wish I knew, playing into the hands of the left and the medical deep state is what cost Trump the election (because of the covid enabled cheating).   My guess is it's because he's a germaphobe, he trusted doctors too much, and he cared only about the economy, not enough about the quality of life of the people.</p>

        <p>That’s what’s been so scary about this to me.</p>
<p>I’ve seen that programming in my own family.</p>
<p>Told them in January of last year to watch out for the virus. News in China was crazy. It hadn’t come here yet, but I knew it would given the infection rate and asymptomatic spread being reported.</p>
<p>News here was saying it was nbd, so they thought it was nbd.</p>
<p>I braced for the worst/bought a fucking hazmat suit early in February not knowing what the fuck this thing was because I know China lies about fucking everything. March came, lockdowns started, and my fucking boomer parents decided they’ll go pick up a sick family member from nyc, the worst god damn place to go.</p>
<p>I try to tell them to let them stay with me cause I’m younger and was hearing about the age difference already, but they’re like “news didn’t say it was bad, just that we had to stay inside with family, and it’s probably not covid, so we’re getting family”</p>
<p>Now, fucking months later after we’ve probably all been exposed, and the numbers are showing it really isn’t that bad for most people (certainly not as bad as I thought originally), they’re going off about needing to wear masks everywhere and pods and shit.</p>
<p>They aren’t dumb people, either, they’re just incapable of questioning whatever “official” guy is trotted out in their networks. It’s been terrifying to see how they trust distant “authorities” over what’s directly in front of them.</p>
<p>It’s not like they have a counter argument either; I could see them making valid counterarguments for wanting to play it safe, given their age, but they just shut down whenever I suggest it’s probably ok for other people to go out/these mask mandates are kind of stupid and not doing anything. They just can’t fucking process it/dismiss it, just like the big fucking warning they dismissed about being around sick people when this started.</p>

        <p>So how do you explain other countries going into lock down? Let’s face it, if the American Democratic Party is so powerful that their political efforts have the backing of over half the world’s nations (and these nations are willing to harm their economic growth in order to assist the Democrat’s motives), then no opponent has any chance of defeating them.</p>

        <p>Definitely. Covid gave the Democrats an ace against him, and they would have been spouting the same rhetoric no matter how well he handled the pandemic and no matter many (or few) people died. They were already screeching at him even before cases landed because of the border closure. If they didn’t have all of that then they would have only had the same tired old orange man bad talking points (which the public surely would have been tired of), or some other kind of outlandish manufactured outrage. Trump likely would have still had the economy on point and the left wouldn’t have been able to push for mail-in voting. I think Biden would still have gotten a ton of votes but there’s no doubt that it would have been an EC landslide for Trump. Democrats were probably giddy about covid knowing how they could use it against him, even though the situation would probably be largely the same under any of their leadership.</p>

        <p>Trump did win, mail-in votes are hard to prove and there is no paper audit in a lot of these contested areas. Trump over performed in most states except the swing states, Biden won the fewest counties ever for a “winner” of a presidential election and broke every statistical probability with his weird returns. It makes no sense, why do you think big tech censors the shit out of anyone who questions the results?</p>

        <p>Idk about all that. Despite a ton of blame being placed on Trump for every single US covid death, he still barely lost. I'm by no means a trump supporter, but the DNC clearly didn't learn their lesson with Hilary that no one actually wants these corrupt out of touch career politicians to lead the charge of "progressivism." Biden is as status quo as it possibly gets and the DNC nearly paid the price for that again. </p>
<p>On another note, there are many countries that didnt lockdown like Sweden and Japan. The US could have easily been one of them.</p>

        <p>No, it's absolutely not good, because it means this can happen again at any time. "Ruining the world for 1 year+" is now a viable move for political parties looking to get one up on their opponents. This could happen again at any time. We don't want the world to open, we want a promise that things like shutting down the healthcare system will never ever happen again. As it stands we live with the threat of this hanging over our heads forever.</p>

<p>The more I think about it the more I'm convinced that was their real problem with Trump, he wasn't interested in Middle Eastern wars.  He'd rather sit at home on Twitter making people mad rather than "spread Democracy" overseas.  And they couldn't stand it.</p>

<p>He ordered strikes on multiple middle eastern countries and nearly started another war by luring an Iranian diplomat to Iraq to be murdered. I know this is the wrong sub, but man, this hot take has no relation to reality.</p>

        <p>I’ll disagree with this.  The hatred of him by the left has pushed the whole nation to a precipice.  I don’t want to tread this close to whatever they have in mind again.  If that means Trump disappears into the abyss, so be it.</p>

        <p>I voted for Trump but he has zero strategy and no ability to hire anyone working for him. I'm all for rallying behind someone that was scammed out of an election, but he would be pretty much the worst commander in chief if a civil war were to actually break out. I'll die for liberty and freedom but I'm not dying for Trump.</p>

        <p>Yea, Trump is a symbol and reality doesn't back the symbolism up. To the one team he was their champion and to the other team he was pure evil. He was of course neither, he was kind of a shit president really. All he really symbolized was that America was on the brink of collapse</p>

        <p>I was never a Trump fan, but I knew this was a political issue from the start. Looking at the CDC data today, I saw that 90% of deaths attributed to “covid-related” issues were in those in the 55+ age range. It also made me wonder.. are all of our politicians in that age range as well? It’s no wonder they would lock down an entire country to save their own asses if they had “only” a 98% chance of living, they only care about themselves. Their paycheck is GUARANTEED, ours is not.</p>

They’re trying to set up Biden to be the hero even though we heard all summer that their would be shortages to start and then it would pick up in March and April.</p>

        <p>Whether you like Trump or hate him is irrelevant. The fact that there are people in power who are willing to destroy the country, ruin our children's future, let cities burn, steal our livelihoods and kill hundreds of thousands of people all just to stick it to a president they don't like is horrifying.</p>

        <p>I had a feeling that regardless of the outcome of the election things would start to go back to some kind of normal afterwards...ever since I saw AOC's now deleted tweet claiming that it was essential to remain in lockdown until after the election so Trump wouldn't have a chance to recover the economy to "make himself look good."

        <p>I have a theory that these governor's extremely coincidental flip flop on the covid bullshit is just for the show.  The media has been talking about the new "super strains" popping up in some areas.  They are going to "allow" us to return to some state of normalcy, then flip flop right back to it.  They will say, we tried to open up, we really really wanted to, but we just can't now.  I just don't believe that they are going to give this power up so easily.</p>
