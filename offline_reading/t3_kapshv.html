        <p>It's really catty to pit subs against each other. NNN seems to have the right mixture of memes, science, and activism to accomplish real things whereas most others don't.  Conspiracy theorists and hippies organize all the rallies in my area, I still go. We can't spend our time fighting would-be allies or policing the boundaries.</p>

        <p>I wasn't trying to pit anyone against anyone. I just thought it was odd they were making fun of us. I dont know who is a flat-earther because I dont read through everyone's posts. Ill delete this though, because I suppose you are correct. We all have a common goal.</p>

        <p>oh, I was talking about them but that's probably a good idea. I do agree that we want to prevent conspiracies from totally subverting the protests, but I'm not going to pick fights with the boomers who show up because they also believe in chemtrails</p>

        <p>Where are all these flat earth posts this guy is talking about? I don’t know why people always attack this sub in particular, I comment on all three of the anti-lockdown subs and there’s barely any difference. Why is this guy looking through everyone’s post history, anyways? Was he looking for a crazy person just so he could write us all off as conspiracy theorists? I feel like posts like these are just made to create division.</p>
