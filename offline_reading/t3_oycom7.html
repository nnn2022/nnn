    <strong>An NPC Loves Fear.</strong>
    <p><p>The reason some (turns out most) people automatically turn to the "experts" is because of one simple thing. Fear. That's entirely it. They buy into the fear. Manufactured or real, doesn't matter.</p>
<p>In an odd way, I feel like they are conditioned to fear, and expect and almost crave it. Like they want to see doom, and pandemonium, and crisis. They cheer it forward and present any new fearful headline of the day as a fresh cup of coffee.</p>
<p>The really interesting part, is they only like abstract fear. Like an earthquake overseas. Something that doesn't impact them directly, but they can latch onto. Not a fear that impacts them directly, but the presence of fear.</p>
<p>However, when the fear comes into real life, it amazingly turns into virtue. "How can I show I'm aware of the fear?" Masks? Stay at home? OK, no problem, "I'm a solution". Get a vaccine from a pharmaceutical company with a shady track record? "No problem, done, and can I get flair to show others I'm "good"?</p>
<p>It's like the kids who thrived on getting gold stars on homework reports for validation, turned to social media for new validation. "I know we should be scared, I'm scared too, but how can I show I'm scared", and also a gold star winner because authority said I should be sacred. I'm doing what I'm told so I'm the good guy, right? </p>
<p>It's giant babies grown into adults who lack any independent thought. They crave to be told what to do, regardless of who says it or if it's actually beneficial.</p>
<p>I guarantee you that if Fauci went on MSNBC and told the nation that if you stick a raw carrot up your asshole, you'll be helping us all... fucking Twitter would blow up with buttholes with carrots in them.</p>
<p>Unreal.</p></p>

        <p>Agreed 100 percent, OP. That comic with the dude with data being all "here are the reasons you don't need to be afraid" had it exactly right. I'm speaking from a LOT of experience on that one. And Lord help me, even though I and others have made similar observations, I literally laughed out loud at your last couple of lines, mainly because it's true.</p>
<p>Anyway, on a serious note, I like posting relevant quotes here, so let me end with a conversation with a wise fictional father and his son:</p>
<p>&rt;Those people in the forest. What did you see on them?<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I do not understand.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Fear. Deep rotting fear. They were infected by it. Did you see? Fear is a sickness. It will crawl into the soul of anyone who engages it. It has tainted your peace already. I did not raise you to see you live with fear. Strike it from your heart. Do not bring it into our village.</p>
