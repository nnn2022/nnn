    <strong>Holy crap</strong>
    <p><p>I had no idea people like this existed on reddit. Real logic and reason is not something I see often on here. The intelligence of everyone really shows through too. Its hard to find someone who does not call the other person a fucktard for disagreeing with them, and here I go and find an entire freaking subreddit. Finding this has really helped me stay logical and not succumb to the dooming and other similar nonsense. Way to go you guys!</p></p>

        <p>I was like that too. I literally don't know a single anti-lockdowner apart from myself, and thought I was kind of crazy for being the only one thinking this way, especially seeing how r/coronavirus behaves.      <br>
I finally found this along with r/LockdownSkepticism a month ago and I was so relieved that I'm not the only one who thinks this is an abhorrent approach.</p>

        <p>&rt; I had no idea people like this existed on reddit. </p>
<p>that is because reddit deleted a bunch of subreddits all questioning the lockdown insanity, criminal government actions, etc...</p>
<p>and reddit of course controls all messages and posts on bigger subreddits, so that a fake view of "everyone is in on it" gets created. the mainstream media does the same.</p>
<p>it would not be surprising if this subreddit gets deleted within the next month sadly.</p>
<p>reddit also shadowbans based on certain truth providing website links and what not.</p>
<p>don't think of reddit as "free speech zone" anymore. think of it as another completely controlled facebook like platform. the only difference is, that people HOPEFULLY are still anonymous mostly on it.</p>

<p>I think we'll be banned/shadowbanned very soon.</p>
<p>Also they are working on new generation of shadowbans, when they'll also throw bots who'll react to your posts making you think you are not banned, but your posts will not be visible to other people, just AI bots. More people will go bonkers. Talking to bots is the worst thing you can do for your mental health.</p>

        <p>I’ve been using this source a lot, and while it’s not exactly “anti everything” it explains the issues quite well. </p>
<p>First we  respond better  as a people to restrictions if they are voluntary, and we are informed of the IFR and can exit or enter a state of abnormality at our own discretion. </p>
<p>Imagine if the news was simply broadcasting the IFR and the multiple ways to manage risk including doing nothing, instead of just panic porn. </p>
<p>&rt; If we accept that a 1918-like pandemic necessitates a public health response, what criteria should we use to apply a menu of NPI that is ethical and efficacious? The historical record of past epidemics indicates that NPI work with the most benefit and least friction when they are voluntary, respect and rely on individual autonomy, and avoid the use of police powers. Furthermore, recent research indicates that the timing, duration, and choice of NPI play an important role in a community’s overall pandemic outcome.</p>
<p>&rt; Mandatory NPI were widely used across the United States in the 1918 influenza pandemic. In several instances, removed communities such as islands (including American Samoa) took advantage of their geographical isolation to restrict access and thus shield themselves entirely from pandemic influenza. However, these success stories were the exception, not the rule. Indeed, many communities applied mandatory NPI in less than systematic fashion, ultimately experiencing problems of noncompliance and NPI fatigue, especially when orders were enacted, rescinded, and reenacted two or more times.</p>
<p>&rt; Broadly speaking, humans have organized mandatory NPI, such as quarantine and isolation, to mitigate the spread of contagion since antiquity. Until fairly recently, the needs, rights or even health of the afflicted (and quarantined) were rarely a primary concern among those administering such health orders. It was only in the years following the civil rights movements of the 1950s and 1960s that principles such as patient autonomy and the protection of civil liberties became legal and ethical cornerstones of public health programs aimed at mitigating infectious disease. It is important to remember the context in which mandatory NPI were implemented in 1918—an era characterized by medical paternalism and strong state authority to intervene with legal immunity in the lives of ordinary citizens.</p>
<p>&rt; Even so, the 1918 experience offers many examples of the application of mandatory NPI that backfired, potentially inciting undue social conflict that worsened disease transmission and, according to today’s standards, would fall far short of ethical standards. In many cities, including San Francisco and Denver, local officials passed mask ordinances requiring individuals to wear layered-gauze masks in public, despite having no clear scientific proof of benefit, and authorizing the police to fine or arrest those who did not comply. These mandatory face mask laws proved to be bad policy. Many people wore the masks incorrectly, and some engaged in subterfuge to avoid wearing them. For others, the masks provided a false sense of security from the pandemic. There were even several instances where those who issued the mask order—including both San Francisco’s mayor and health commissioner—were seen at public events with the masks dangling across their necks and not properly fastened. Some citizens formed antimask leagues and placarded the streets with antimask manifestos. There also was pushback to mandatory school closures and social distancing measures in many American cities during the fall of 1918, especially when these NPI were deactivated only to be reactivated days or weeks later when citizens felt that daily life was returning to some semblance of normality. In the worst instances, mandatory NPI pushback put society at greater risk of infection, and the haphazard application of NPI eroded the public trust.</p>
<p>I ask, what makes anyone think this will work better than 102 years ago? This bioethics think tank is almost arguing it’s going to work “worse” with expanded civil rights.(imo a good thing).</p>
<p>The only thing I think you could argue is the masks might work so slightly better, and that’s honestly questionable. </p>
<p>Pre-April 2020 meta analysis: https://www.cochrane.org/CD006207/ARI_do-physical-measures-such-hand-washing-or-wearing-masks-stop-or-slow-down-spread-respiratory-viruses</p>
<p>&rt; Seven studies took place in the community, and two studies in healthcare workers. Compared with wearing no mask, wearing a mask may make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like illness (9 studies; 3507 people); and probably makes no difference in how many people have flu confirmed by a laboratory test (6 studies; 3005 people). Unwanted effects were rarely reported, but included discomfort.</p>
<p>So why are we somewhat compliant? Mass fear. Watch the news, or go on a news website. Every headline is bad. Have you seen a good headline for 8 months on the virus? Very rare. Maybe the death rate is down and hospital rate is down, but CASES ARE UP. Why? A combination of public health officials choosing fearful messages and also a desire for clicks and revenue.</p>
