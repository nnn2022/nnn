<title>Not sure if this fits here, but it's jarring to see the difference in media coverage between our former and current president. To be honest, the article isn't worth a read unless you're bored and want a good chuckle. It's essentially Biden fan fiction.</title>

<p>I am sure that Jonathan Evans was giggling like a school girl while typing up the above trash.</p>
<p>I think that maybe, he was sitting on his thumb and spinning. </p>
<p>I am sure Jonathan Evans had a three way with Obama and Biden and he was the middle part of the "H".</p>

        <p>I was in high school during Obama, And I wasn’t really politically aware at all until 2015, but I will say the first thing I thought when I saw that suit was “it’ll be the tan suit thing all over again,” even though I never heard a single person ever say anything about Obama stand suit (and as much as I despise Obama, he looked better in his tan suit then Biden looks in his… Not that I think any man ever should wear a tan suit at any time ever, because you just look like you are naked or in old Navy uniform)</p>
