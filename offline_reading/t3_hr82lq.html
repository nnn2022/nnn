        <p>I'm sorry to say but is this really a surprise. Bus drivers can't even enforce fares because of how people react. Was this really unforeseeable?  I do believe the state is partially to blame for shifting enforcement onto business owners despite the high probably that at least one event like this would happen. However, I'm very sorry for the victims.</p>

        <p>Agreed. I feel sorry for the victims, but I'm not surprised at all. I used to work as a bus driver (I now work elsewhere with the same transit agency), and during bus training, they emphasized to us that the fare is on the honor system, and that it's not our job to enforce the fare, as that's transit police's job. Similarly, state governments have put the burden on the stores, who should never be put in the position of enforcing state directives like that. It's really not in their interest to do so, and this is one reason why.</p>

        <p>Yep, this is exactly why these things that are not norms in western culture can’t be mandated all of a sudden.</p>

        <p>Agreed.  This should have been allowed to develop naturally, with governments making recommendations on this rather than mandates.  The people that would want to do it could do it, and the rest of us could go about live unmuzzled.</p>

        <p>The incident:</p>
<p>&rt; Michigan State Police said a masked man from Lansing, 77, and an unmasked man from Grand Ledge, Sean Ruis, 43, got into an altercation regarding wearing masks.</p>
<p>&rt; Police said the customer not wearing a mask was refused service by the store.</p>
<p>&rt; MSP said Ruis pulled out a knife and stabbed the 77-year-old Lansing man and then fled the scene in a car.</p>
<p>&rt; Police said a deputy with the Eaton County Sheriff’s Department located the suspect vehicle and conducted a traffic stop in Delta Township around 7:13 a.m.</p>
<p>&rt; MSP said Ruis immediately exited the vehicle and walked toward the deputy with a knife “in hand to attack the deputy.”</p>
<p>&rt; Police said the deputy, a 22-year veteran, attempted to increase distance by backing up and “subsequently shot and injured” Ruis who was taken to the hospital and died during surgery.</p>
<p>&rt; MSP said the deputy wasn’t injured.</p>
<p>&rt; A witness said he saw a female deputy chase Ruis when he stopped and got out of his car. The witness said the deputy yelled at Ruis and then he heard gunshots.</p>
<p>&rt; The stabbing victim, the 77-year-old man, was also taken to a local hospital for his injuries. Police say he is alive, but Quality Dairy CEO Ken Martin said in a phone interview that the victim is in critical condition.</p>
<p>&rt; A Michigan Department of Transportation spokesperson said Ruis was a transportation technician at MDOT and has been working there since 2008. Ruis had been expected to come to work Tuesday.</p>
<p>&rt; The Eaton County Sheriff’s Office said Ruis didn’t have any kind of criminal history in the county.</p>
<p>&rt; Both incidents remain under investigation.</p>
<p>I remember, maybe around May, a woman at Dollar Tree got hysterical because the worker refused to allow her into the store without a mask on. She pleaded at first, then began to throw a huge tantrum. My spouse and I wore masks to go in, and kind of stood away from the situation. I almost wanted to defend her, but she was just... I mean, I had sympathy for her, but at the same time, she was being unreasonably violent. It's the only incident I've witnessed similar to what's in this article.</p>
