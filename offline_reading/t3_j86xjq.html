    <strong>A 13 year old boy from my mom’s school ran away from an abusive home and is now living homeless.</strong>
    <p><p>I got news that not only did a 13 year old go homeless yesterday, but a good friend of my family’s also died of an overdose yesterday. He was only 19. </p>
<p>NO ONE i’ve been in contact with has been directly affected by this O Holy Ghost that goes by the name of Covid-19. I’m so fucking done with these lockdowns and the insufferable neckbeards that support them.</p>
<p>Half of me wants to just give up on this dystopian world and kill myself, the other half of me wants to break everyone out of this prison these disgusting fucks have forced my generation into.</p></p>

        <p>I feel so sorry for that 13 year old - I suppose that he wasn't able to access any support services at school because they're shut down now. Why does "90 year old dies of flu" tug at people's heartstrings but "13 year old boy homeless" doesn't?!</p>

        <p>i would suggest option B trying to wake more people up.</p>
<p>however you can also get a gun, if u live in a country, that didn't have enough false flags to ban guns yet.</p>
<p>so in case things get to bad you always would have that option to use for option A and of course it is a great tool for self defense.</p>
<p>also in regards to the 13 year old and given, that the pedophile gangster ring around the world, maybe there is a way to at least give him a place to sleep at your place? no idea what the stupid legislation is in that regard and no idea if you can find him, but at least he'd be safe from being  thrown in a truck and disappearing, which is very common, given the world wide working child trafficking networks run by monsters.</p>
