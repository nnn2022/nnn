    <strong>My response to a friend urging me to get vaxxed.</strong>
    <p><p>I tried to keep the tone pretty relatable to someone who sees things differently as I'm hoping to explain my perspective without devolving into endless link sharing/debate. Would love to hear any reactions y'all may have.</p>
<p>Hey bro, thanks for concern. This vaccine is effective at mitigating symptoms and likely somewhat in cutting incidence (jury still out), seemingly no change on spread after contraction. I do not doubt that people are getting sick and/or dying. But anecdotal evidence can only take us so far. I respect the knowledge of experts and people immersed in this, but they can easily lose sight of big picture by being so involved every day. Not to mention the top experts have changed course countless times throughout all this as it is so new and unfolding. We could also go down the rabbit hole of adverse vaccine reactions.</p>
<p>But you know as much as anyone that we make decisions based on data and probability. From everything I've seen, risk of severe illness and death is extremely low in our age bracket and with good health. I feel comfortable with this risk (similar to the relatively high risk of dying in a car crash on a road trip).</p>
<p>Which brings us to end game. This virus like all previous coronaviruses is highly mutable. We have never managed to eradicate these and I see no evidence that leads me to believe we will be able to with this one (even with all the vaccination and precautions possible). Vaccine efficacy wanes after 4-8 months or so, combine that with new variants and everyone is signing up for an indefinite vaccine subscription service taking ungodly amounts of money and delivering it through gov to massive pharma companies.</p>
<p>Alternatively there is compelling evidence (although rarely reported) for natural immunity after infection. This whole time my view is vaccinate/quarantine high risk groups and anyone else who wants/needs that, and let natural immunity build. Combine that with coronavirus virus' natural tendency to mutate towards being milder and over the course of time it becomes another flu.</p>
<p>I do not want to get sick or die, and don't want that for anyone I love, or anyone at all. I just don't realistically see another path that makes sense in the big picture.</p></p>

        <p>Donâ€™t compromise for anyone in this matrix. Your points were clear and concise; if they choose to not respect your decision and/or judge you for it - move on.</p>
