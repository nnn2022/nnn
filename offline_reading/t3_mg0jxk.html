    <strong>Any links to "reliable" covid mortality rates?</strong>
    <p><p>Hey everyone. Does anyone know any websites from so called "reliable/reputable/authoritative" sources showing the current covid mortality rates.</p>
<p>Google searches don't seem to bring up any easily accessible info. I used to quote the US CDC for mortality rates (but still got called a conspiracy theorist spreading misinformation... somehow... just by quoting possibly the most mainstream "reliable" source for the United States). Unless if I just cant find it anymore then it seems the CDC no longer posts a table of mortality rates by age after Biden took office (and now just has weird tables comparing deaths by race as a percentage of white people). </p>
<p>I just want a source that I can quote for "official" mortality rates for when I talk to people and they refuse to believe that there is a ~99.95% survival rate for most age groups.</p>
<p>TL;DR
Where can I find an authoritative mainstream source for constantly updated covid mortality rates?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p></p>

        <p>Don't look at COVID-19 mortality. Like you said, it depends a lot on how deaths are classified, and heavily politicized.</p>
<p>It's better to look at excess deaths. It's not as easy to fudge those numbers.</p>

        <p>Maybe I just can't find it, but I don't see a % survival rate or % death rate. Because they used to have that. While for common sense using folk we all know the survival rate is in the 99-99.99% range, other people won't believe it unless they see it written out for them (and even then most of them still deny it)</p>

        <p>We would need to know how many people in each age group have been infected. You’re right, there is no survival percentage listed.</p>
<p>I tell people less than 8000 people under the age of 40 have died in the USA.</p>
<p>People are still going to go....but but long Covid!</p>

        <p>Yeah it's ridiculous. Don't get me wrong - the numbers are not going to be accurate, but even with their pro-lockdown bias in reporting covid deaths the numbers are just screaming "this isn't that scary". On an anecdotal note I even know people above the age of 80 and 90 (family and family of friends) who got covid and survived. Don't know anyone who died yet though.</p>

        <p>My 74 year old cancer survivor father made it through. Almost everyone I know has had it at this point. </p>
<p>I don’t know anyone with “long” Covid either.</p>

        <p>BUT I SAW IT ON THE TV!!!! Most of the time when I see the media reporting on the "long term" effects of covid, if you listen to the full story the person in question had many other conditions as well. No possible correlation ;)</p>

        <p>There's really no such thing. Since the only published mortality rates use pcr to identify disease, we don't have access to the real data. I had a long conversation with a UK doc who I genuinely believe reported only authentic covid deaths, but that's not what the UK publishes, we don't have access to that raw data.</p>
