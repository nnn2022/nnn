    <strong>Open Letter to the WeenieBrigade.</strong>
    <p><p>I see you. I see you coming here, with your obvious 3month old accounts with no karma shillbaggery. Seemingly some kind of paid agents of deception behind them, or an obtuse genuine Moral Busybody or Nosy Ninny, preaching the virtues of that operating system(Modernas words, not mine) they want to transfect into my body. The cult of covid can seethe! Seethe hardddd!!!!!  Seethe soo hard your head explodes like that dude from Scanners!  </p>

<p>It makes me happy to think about how upset y'all are getting. Lmao! How about you worry about yourself for a change, instead of pretending to care about me. Which is obvious y'all don't really care. The beta weaklings out there just love exert their illegitimate flaccid power over others, which gives them a false sense of authority to overcome their own insecurities, and probably some kind euphoric high, telling others what to do, in a sick perverse way.   </p>
<p>Either, you paid the debt yourself, and bought and swallowed the govpill, with some kind of fucked up sense of distorted pride I might add, every little thing daddy government told you unquestioningly. Even more absurdly, you all, genuinely thinking you are some kind of legitimate moral busybodies positively helping society, with your morally superior attitudes and platitudes, blindly working towards the gREaTeRGOoD! cloaked in a false hope of restoring society back to it's previous fa√ßade.(which isn't happening btw) </p>
<p>Or you are some kind of paid agent of deception, lubricated with funds under 1.5 billion the US government spent on Covid19 mind control propaganda. I don't give a flying fuck. You sowed your fate when you took ol' Billy boys demon semen. I haven't. Quit thinking your going to <em>change my mind</em>. I'm not hesitant you dolts! I'm dug in hard. So hard, I will die on this hill. Fuck you, and the horse you rode in on. You seriously have to be a dense diluted bunch to think we can't see WTF is going on here. These little weenieloafs from the <em>weeniebrigade</em> are only fortifying my resolve into diamond hands, and hardening my stance into perpetuity ad infinum. The more y'all try to sell it, the less we want it. Period. Now, go eat your donut like a good weenieloaf, and don't forget to virtue signal on the gram while doing it! </p>
<p>I don't give a fuck who you are. You hear me now, huh? I am never bending knee to the likes of you or your ilk. The people who watch T.V.(the greatest weapon ever made) Covidian Cultist, or paid agents of deception can segunda deez nutz! Behold my field of fucks, for it is barren, and I have no more fucks to give because I'm left cleaning up a societal mess created by military-grade psy-ops, run through the T.V., funded by pharma and others, and wargame planned by NGO's(Rockerfeller Institute),and sanctified by fraudci. You people make me sick. Sicker than corona ever did. </p>
<p>I'm left trying to ameliorate the onus caused by the covid cultist insouciance for mine, and my NNN brethren's bodily autonomy, just cause those little weasels fraudci and xiden said so.....  Yeah, well, I don't think so.</p></p>
