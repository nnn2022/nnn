    <strong>This will only end when people allow it to end</strong>
    <p><p>Whenever people talk about what will be the conditions under which the pandemic will end, they mention such extreme conditions, and even when those are met the goalposts are always moved so that there’s always another thing we have to wait for. Near 0 covid deaths won’t happen. But hundreds of thousands of people die from the flu in each country every year and we were fine. When the pandemic ends it will have nothing to do with the virus or how many people are infected. It will be when we are told it’s allowed to end. When the media stops advertising it, when the government stops dictating that it’s still here. That’s not up to the virus, that’s up to our leaders.</p>
<p>For one a year I have known no one affected by covid and I have known no one who knows anyone affected by covid. I’m at university right now, and we are tested twice a week. We literally know that no one here has covid. Yet the pandemic exists. No in person classes, only permitted to socialise with 5 selected people, no events, in you bedroom 22 hours of the day. We have to pretend everyone is sick even though we literally know no one is. There is no virus, yet there is a pandemic. Why? Because they demand it exists.</p></p>

        <p>No. It will end when God decides it is time for it to end. It is time to endure and to repent.</p>
