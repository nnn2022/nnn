    <strong>Just here to find some evidence.</strong>
    <p><p>Hi guys, </p>
<p>I have been on this subreddit for many months and agreeing with the majority that is on here. </p>
<p>However I am now reaching a point where due to my work in healthcare I am expected to the the covid vaccine. Can anyone help me find any evidence of the trials that the covid vaccine skipped, or what the normal vaccine testing procedures are compare to the covid vaccine. </p>
<p>If i can find enough high quality evidence I will have a leg to stand on instead of being called a "conspiracy theorist". </p>
<p>Thanks so much in advance!!</p></p>

        <p>&rt; instead of being called a "conspiracy theorist"</p>
<p>I am a conspiracy theorist. If that's what it takes to not take the shot, then by all means, call me the king of conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p>I think what you should do is find evidence <em>that it's 100% safe</em>.</p>
<p>They can't. Because every healthcare professional should very well know that one can only say something of the effects of a vax after a certain amount of years.</p>
<p>Question <em>them</em> instead of let them question you. You feel fine, right? Why bother taking a vax then?</p>
<p>Also keep in mind: you can find another job. You can't however undo the shot.</p>

        <p>Well, if you live in the States like apparently most of people here, then all you need to know is that it is not an FDA approved drug. They have emergency authorization for distributing it, because they don't meet the FDA requirements, clearly.</p>

        <p>Its not so much that trials were skipped as they are still ongoing. People in the initial trials are still going to be monitored for the next few years</p>

        <p>Of course they were. There's a reason why there's no county on the planet where covid vaccines ha e regular approval. It's "emergency" based everywhere. It's still in what would normally be called trial stage</p>

        <p>All animal safety trials were skipped.  They did animal <em>efficacy</em> trials, but not the safety ones, which is where all previous coronavirus vaccines failed.</p>

        <p>You only get one body.</p>
<p>Mine is messed up right now because of a medication I was prescribed.  The side effects have made it so that I've been unable to walk normally for 3 months.   There is a possibility I may never recover.</p>
<p>The current shots provided by these pharma companies have some very severe side effects.   Look at the VAERS data for the past two months.   Almost 1,000 deaths.</p>
<p>There is no antidote.   If you get a side effect, you are stuck with the consequences.   You have to cover you medical bills, lost wages, and pain and suffering.  You.  No one else.</p>
<p>Ask your employer if they will cover all that for you.   If they will be responsible for any damage to your body.  And not just now, but long term.</p>
