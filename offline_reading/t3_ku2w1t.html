    <strong>It amazes me how many people say they’re “scared” but go out in public and demand everyone else wear a mask.</strong>
    <p><p>I live in a state with no mask mandate. Some stores have requirements but don’t really enforce it. I was at Ulta (a makeup store) earlier when someone asked me to wear a mask. I just ignored the woman and kept shopping. She then said I’m “putting people’s heath at risk.” I then asked if makeup was essential to her survival, then she left me alone. </p>
<p>This is what irritates me about people who are “scared” but continue to go out for so called “non-essential services.” That woman didn’t have to go out to the makeup store, but she did and went up to me to tell me to put a mask on. If you’re “scared” but continue to go out to these places while demanding everyone else wear a mask, you’re not really scared. The only way to really avoid COVID is it stay home, but they aren’t scared of it so they went out.</p></p>

        <p>That’s how we know it’s all about moral authority and trying to control others. If this was about fear of the virus, these Karen’s would run out of the building as soon as they see a maskless person instead of go up &amp; confront them and then follow them around the store heckling them for not wearing a mask. This is why people to go the mall, the beach, and restaurants and then take to take social media to complain about the crowds and how this will never end if people won’t stay home.</p>

        <p>It reminds also of the campaign last years where people were via the media to be made ashame of airplane travelling altogether because it was "bad for the climate." However many of those complaining most about this, were themselves among the rich and doing 4 vacations per year.</p>

        <p>It reminds me of a ditzy valley girl I went to high school with. In history, we had a man come in to talk about the Vietnam war because he fought in it, and talked about how they couldn't have deodorant, and this is how it went:</p>
<p>Girl: Wait, you couldn't wear deodorant?!</p>
<p>Veteran: Well, would you rather be wearing sweaty clothes, or a body bag?</p>
<p>Girl: Wait, what's a body bag?</p>
<p>This was also the girl that had never seen a rotary phone and that didn't know how to read a clock. <em>In high school.</em> </p>
<p>I'm really scared about the future since we have people like this in this generation.</p>

        <p>I hate masks, but I always thought we'd at least get close to the old normal - just with masks.</p>
<p>Instead, these life-saving amulets, the all-powerful masks, are so fucking useless that even with 100% of everyone wearing them indoors, and 80% wearing them outdoors (I'm in NYC) we're still half shut-down and cases are rising...</p>

        <p>The infection control nurse at my job told me straightforwardly: "masks aren't effective".</p>
<p>Background: I had been sitting with a coworker for several hours (more than 6 feet apart).  We were both wearing masks.  He ended up testing positive for COVID, and I was told I had to quarentine for 14 days due to being his "close contact".  When I mentioned we were wearing masks as required by our employer, the infection control nurse explained that masks haven't proven to be reliable. </p>
<p>So if they're not doing much health-wise, I see wearing them as a sign of obedience to the government or loyalty to a certain political party.</p>

        <p>There is no study that shows that cloth masks do much of anything. I think I read one study from 2018 or so that showed that in the best of circumstances, they could perhaps decrease infections by about 10% if symptomatic people wore them but even that was theoretical. The whole notion of hordes of evil anti-maskers just dying to give everyone covid is a myth, a fantasy propagated by people that don't understand why all these "perfect" restrictions aren't working. What is also a myth is that cloth masks stop covid 100%. Where did the myth even start that if everyone wore masks covid would be defeated? That's clearly not true and it never was true, but that lie is considered "science" by the vast majority of intelligent people.</p>

        <p>Ok but it's still a woman's prerogative if she wants to wear clothes to "titillate the male gaze." Are you trying to say she deserves harassment or unwanted attention for her clothing choices? Perhaps she's dressed with one male in mind.. Does that give every douche bag a free pass to bang her? I really hate this argument. Seriously. And a terrible analogy.</p>

        <p>&rt;Are you trying to say she deserves harassment or unwanted attention for her clothing choices?</p>
<p>She can't have it both ways.</p>
<p>&rt;Perhaps she's dressed with one male in mind..</p>
<p>In public?</p>
<p>&rt; Does that give every douche bag a free pass to bang her?</p>

        <p>She can absolutely have it both ways. In fact, she can wear whatever the fuck she wants. It's her choice. Isn't that what this entire anti lockdown shit is based on? Choice? </p>

        <p>It doesn't work that way. If a women dresses in a way that attracts attention from men, she will get attention from men. She can't then turn around and complain about it because the men in question are not up to her made up standard. Demand attention, then get upset you get attention from everyone, no just Prince Charming? LMAO!</p>

        <p>Mhm, this was always one of the things that have annoyed me the most throughout the past year or so.</p>
<p>If this virus is really so deadly and awful, then you should be staying inside. Not going out in public, putting countless others at risk, all so you can selfishly go get your "fire af Starbeez pumpkin spice latte". All while demanding that every other person and business be as terrified and paranoid of this weak as fuck virus as you are.</p>
<p>All when, if you're truly so terrified, you should be home anyways. In which case, it doesn't really matter what precautions others are or aren't taking. I know that's what I'd be doing if I was truly so spooked by a virus.</p>
<p>Just live your life, and I'll live mine. Win-win.</p>

        <p>It was kinda nice when we were doing the whole two weeks thing... all the doom and gloom types were actually staying the fuck home. I'd go to Walmart and it was just a bunch of chill old people and no one was bothering anyone about masks </p>
<p>Theres certain risks you just accept by participating in society. Communicable disease is one of those. It seems so delusional to me to expect anything else and I just resent being forced to participate in such delusion</p>

        <p>Love this! So annoying. I live in a small rural town in a state with no mask mandate. I’m a waitress at a very small restaurant and my boss tried mandating masks for the waitresses and we all refused. (She doesn’t believe in masks either. We just live in a small town, and you know small town talk. She was just trying to be a people pleaser.) But that was one of my main arguments. If these people are going to go dine-in in a restaurant then how worried are they, really?</p>

        <p>That's why my boss has always been really lax with the mask rules. He owns a gift shop. Literally nothing in that store is essential. If you're traveling and shopping for touristy knicknacks, I think you've already accepted the risk.</p>

        <p>Some of them don't even properly understand the virus. One Doomer I know thinks that it can waft in through the cracks in doors. That would require a symptomatic person to be standing very close to the house, and still, it might not even happen.</p>

I have some in-laws who are die hard Covidians, they constantly bitch about people not wearing masks and shit. Interestingly enough over the holidays one of their parents caught COVID. On Christmas Eve they decided to go to their parents house to “drop off gifts” and were gone for over 3 hours. A week later they and their spouse test positive for COVID. I swear one of them even said, “I don’t know how this could have happened, i WaS wEarInG mY mAsK.”</p>

        <p>My daughter shops at Ulta and they're maskholes in there so she does curbside pickup because it's a total pain in their rear, they're not set up for it at all. She's a huge pain in the ass too, does things like wait until the temp outside is as miserable as possible (especially over the Arizoba summer) park in the farthest curbside spot, ignore the people when they come out, wait until they come up to the window and maybe even have to knock on the window, then she cracks the window and she's like, "could you put that directly into the trunk like the website says" as if they're the biohazard, makes them wait while she pops the trunk. Then she backs out of the curbside spot into a regular spot, gets out and goes into Target while they're walking back in. She irritated one girl so bad she was ranting and waving her arms around like a crazy person. Fun part about that is, that girl is the prime maskhole,, "You'll have to put on a mask to be in this store."</p>

        <p>My standard response to "mask up Karens"
..What?!? I can't hear you....what?!....huh......? Or "its all good I had it already,....no prob....my 84 year old aunt did too....."</p>
<p>I love hearing the groans and humphs too....dudes are so insecure to even say anything. Theyre usually lefty dudes that don't know work or have never been socked in the jaw.</p>
<p>I'm usually in work gear or looking sharp with nice shoes and a good hat. When I'm on the "hood", none of the Arab clerks wear a mask and maybe 40% of the shoppers have anything on. Love it. Free the hood, they're the onea most affected by lockdowns.</p>

<p>Three groups of people: shamers, afraid, nnn - </p>

        <p>I don't believe the actual fearful exist, maybe they're just locked away so I don't encounter any. Society is full of "advocates for the less fortunate" SJW's who are constantly taking offense on behalf of others. The shamers are those people. The people changing the name of the "Redskins" while the high school mascot of the school on our local reservation is the Redskins and they're proud of it. People who claim that women should be able to wear a slutty outfit without gaining the attention of men, when their slutty friend really enjoys the attention she gets. These busybodies need to mind their own business. The more unpleasant you make it for the shamers, the less likely they are to bother the next person. If they do it, make them uncomfortable.</p>

        <p>I had a similar experience yesterday</p>
<p>I was minding my old business, doing some shopping. Then some old hag walks up to me and says "why aren't you wearing a mask? Everyone else has to." I just reply "that's absolutely none of your business" and she huffs and walks off.</p>
<p>What is it with these people? What makes them think that they have the right to harass people, even in spite of the many announcements/messages asking people to be respectful?</p>

        <p>This is the most frustrating thing about restrictions and guidelines. Governments are forcing us all to follow them in solidarity. They're making at risk people feel safe doing whatever they want with things like mask mandates and stupid stickers on the floor. If they really cared they'd create programs for the at risk and education while leaving the rest of us alone.</p>

        <p>I mean, yes, there are plenty of people who are hypocrites - the mask requirement is still real, whether or not its a legal mandate or not.</p>
<p>I don't confront people in person, because I try not to assume they are being unreasonable irresponsible adults.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, people are trying to 'live' in a new normal, no they should either stay inside and wait it out or they should make arrangements to live in a manner putting as few other people at risk as possible. The later is hard and expensive to do correctly...so really people should stop trying to live a new normal at all.</p>

        <p>She's not wrong though. By wearing the mask you're protecting others. It's been proven that it's even more preventative when you yourself wear it. How you ask? Because if you're a carrier you're not spreading it then. It's ridiculous that you don't care about other people.</p>

        <p>What proof? The data doesn’t bear out. Places with high compliance don’t have consistent data showing that compliance leads to lower transmission rates. The transmission rates have nothing to do with how well people wear the mask or not. And the “proof” that they have any effect is specious at best. It’s based on very specific lab conditions that aren’t able to be replicated in the real world. And even in those conditions, the ability to curb transmission is very minimal. Stop blaming people not wearing the mask for transmission rates, because the evidence doesn’t bear out.</p>
<p>And the idea that you protect others and not yourself is dumb as fuck. If it goes one way, it goes the other way. And so if you’re scared and genuinely think masks work, you wearing it should be enough to protect you.</p>
<p>And more and more actual evidence is coming out that people aren’t “carriers” for the disease. If you have symptoms, you can spread it and if you don’t you can’t. And it requires sustained close contact. So shopping in the supermarket or walking in a restaurant or browsing a makeup store will not cause transmission. </p>
<p>It’s ridiculous that YOU don’t care about people. Clearly you’re a selfish asshole if you’re trying to dictate how people should dress and act. Be a little more respectful and understanding of other people. No one owes you anything.</p>

        <p>First off. Sick leave? It's been almost a year. No amount of sick leave is going to pay my bills for that long. </p>
<p>Secondly yes you're right. I have a history of lung problems. I easily get pneumonia and bronchitis and have had to use an inhaler for it at times in the past. It was never fatal or even close, but it's something I am susceptible to. Doesn't matter. Have to wear the mask because apparently there is no way I'm smart enough to assess risk for myself.</p>

        <p>I am a sales consultant. There is no other option but to work with customers directly, and my customers wouldn't like the downgrade of service that would come with the change. </p>
<p>What I want is the ability to make choices about this virus and the risks there-in for myself. I don't want to have my government or anyone else choosing for me.</p>

<p>Yea. As stupid as that sounds, you are that stupid. That’s the future we have with your attitude. </p>
<p>Funny thing is, if I wear one it fogs up my glasses every time I breathe. How am I supposed to drive my car?  Good thing I stopped giving a damn back in April.</p>

        <p>I have PTSD. It takes about 10 seconds in a mask to start a full blown panic attack that causes me to relive my trauma. Every fucking day, multiple times a day. So yes, it is that fucking hard to put a piece of fucking cloth on my fucking face for less than a fucking hour.</p>
<p>It’s not just a piece of cloth, this is my life and well-being, tanked and destroyed for people who could choose to protect themselves and take control of their own lives and health. Fuck off.</p>

        <p>I have a similar issue, I was sexually assaulted repeatedly by a family member while my face was covered and the masks make me have the same feeling and enduce panic attacks. I have trained myself to wear one with a lot of holes in it when necessary (doctor's office, etc) and I consider it a point of pride to have overcome that challenge to some extent. Any comment about covering my face makes me defend that adolescent girl so I go from zero to 60 in less than a second. A loud, "Fuck you", is as likely a response as anything else I might say. I'm so pissed off in public about the sheep who are wearing it that anybody who makes eye contact usually immediately scurries away.  I had a guy in church put one on while we were having a conversation and I stopped mid-word and said, "Ok, bye, have a great week." And walked away. He has made a point to come talk to me every Sunday since, maskless. I forgive him but I won't soon forget that he thinks of me as a biohazard. Any mask compliance puts me at greater risk with my internal challenge so I feel pretty strongly about sheep too. If 20-25% of the people stopped, the middle 40% would give it up too. If 65% stopped, another 20% who feel silly would stop too and we'd be down to the same 15-20% of the population that's crazy about every other issue. They'd be easy to identify and avoid.</p>
