    <strong>Mobility reports and lockdown compliance</strong>
    <p><p>Just playing with data from Apple mobility reports, we can measure how people comply with lockdowns. What is very clear is that the second and third lockdowns always mean a much lower reduction of mobility. No city has the same reduction of mobility that was experienced in March.</p>
<p>I will use foot traffic as data.</p>
<p>New york: march -70%, october +30%, december -40%</p>
<p>Los Angeles: march -60%, october +20%, december -9%</p>
<p>London: march, - 80%, october 0%, december -64% (it is interesting to see that it was +5% a few days ago)</p>
<p>Toronto: march, -70%, october, 0%, december -40%</p>
<p>Buenos Aires: march, -90%, october, -60%, december -60%</p>
<p>Berlin: march, -90%, october, -30%, december, -60%.</p>
<p>Rio de Janeiro: march, -70%, october, -40%, december, -34%.</p>
<p>São Paulo (my city): march, -80%, ocotober, -40%, december, -47%.</p>
<p>I could go on and on. What can you infer from these numbers? That the law of diminishing returns of lockdowns is on anywhere in the world. Everywhere, the second lockdowns had a much smaller reduction of mobility.</p>
<p>This data has distortions, because, in cities like São Paulo and London, car traffic is much stronger.</p>
<p>How long can we expect to see people complying with lockdowns? Los Angeles is a city where the terror discourse of covid. How can they have almost the normal mobility within lockdown?</p>
<p>Who do you think?</p></p>
