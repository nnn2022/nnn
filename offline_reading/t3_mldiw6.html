        <p>I mean...it’s the ~~MSM~~ government that told them they should be scared. </p>
<p>I think a lot of people do want to go back to the way things used to be, but are either too scared of what the government/elite owned media has told them, too scared of fines/incarceration, or too scared to be labeled a “science denier” when questioning why a piece of cloth that has existed for thousands of years suddenly protects us from a virus that supposedly all would fit in a 12oz cola (https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210210-why-the-entire-coronavirus-would-fit-in-a-can-of-coca-cola). </p>
<p>Either way, I believe when a few people start standing up, more will follow.  Time for some dominoes...</p>

        <p>I kind of wish people wouldn’t downvote this - you’re simply following what the narrative told you, and you weren’t overly defensive or anything...</p>
<p>And that’s fine - you’re welcome to trust the peer reviewed journals you read, <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817">and I can trust the ones I have read</a>. </p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Maybe we should take a step back...  Can we stop pretending that piece of cloth is a life saving device, accepting the government is a benevolent entity that cares about your safety, and believing C19 is really dangerous if you’re under 60 years old?  </p>
<p>Was it scary a year ago? Absolutely. But we know so much more now - we have the vaccine (if that’s what makes you feel safe), and our treatment for bad cases of C19 is so much better now because we’ve had a year to learn about the virus.</p>

        <p>Big pharma is also the biggest lobbyists. They definitely want this thing to keep going. If me and you go get the vaccine, that’s more money to them. I heard fauci has stocks in moderna, do you think he wants this to end right now? Bill gates said he quadrupled his wealth with vaccines, you think he wants this to end? </p>
<p>Do you believe that people in power should be able to have conflicts of interest? If they didn’t mandate the masks, you wouldn’t even be reminded of the virus. They might help slightly but you see virologists with full on suits working with viruses because a mask isn’t going to prevent you from getting it. </p>
<p>Let’s not forget the fact the virus has a astronomically high survival rate in almost everyone on the planet. Why not shelter the vulnerable and let the young all get it? </p>
<p>It’s impossible to argue with you guys because the mask makes you guys all feel like superheroes. Yes it’s easy to wear them but vaccine passports are on the horizon. The vaccine is under emergency use, so how can we justify a passport for a vaccine that’s not approved for a virus with a 99% + survival rate in almost everyone? It’s just insane. </p>
<p>The passport also won’t stop with covid, it’ll progress to flu vaccine and all vaccines. New ones that come out, the boosters for the “variants” and so on. We’d be giving away the freedom of your own body. So how can YOU justify that?</p>

        <p>Where in this study is the efficacy of cloth masks in a public setting?  In a highly controlled laboratory environment, it conclusive that cloth masks are 50% effective </p>

<p>See - I too can poke holes in a random article posted online. Maybe our world is a little more complex than a one-size-fits-all theory and there are more variable in the world than can be replicated in a lab environment.

<p>See - I too can poke holes in studies. It’s because no study is going say with a 100% certainty that masks work or don’t in public because there are too many uncontrollable variables in a public setting. I’m not denying masks work. I’m denying they work well in a public setting where people don’t remotely follow actual guidelines that predicate the success of mask wearing. I also believe the damage being done to children’s development far outweigh the risks of not wearing a mask for C19 - but that’s a separate rant...</p>

        <p>It does say... the tread count for their masks that they tested were 600 thread count and they had multiple differant tests with differant layers. And found that even single layer cotton masks are comparable with r95 masks for the size of covid droplets. R95 being 99.9+-.1 and single layer cloth being 98.4+-.2</p>

        <p>I don't know if I'd go as far to say that they <em>loved</em> him. He was a libertarian before libertarianism was cool, he's almost like he was the GOP's very own Bernie Sanders especially in 2012 but of course the party ousted him. Reddit was always hard left tho, you'd be kidding yourselves if you think anyone in r/pol would have voted for him over Obama because yay socialism. You're right tho, you used to at least be able to <em>sort of</em> have a conversation from time to time but Reddit is full blown wojack NPC now.</p>

        <p>&rt;Obama because yay socialism</p>
<p>Obama on capitalism and socialism:</p>
<p>&rt;"It is important to remember that capitalism has been the greatest driver of prosperity and opportunity the world has ever seen."</p>
<p>&rt; "It is true that I am concerned about inequality, but no one questions the efficacy of a market economy in terms of producing wealth and innovation and keeping us competitive."</p>
<p>&rt;He decried equally "unregulated, unbridled, unethical capitalism" and "old-style command-and-control socialism" in favor of traditional American liberalism, "an inclusive market-based system."</p>
<p>Obama is a liberal. And while Americans have got their political terms twisted beyond belief, a liberal is still <strong>pro-capitalism</strong>. Quit making a fool out of yourself and educate yourself on basic political economics. Just because somebody wants a bigger or more interventionist government, it does not mean that they are in favor of abolishing private property and working towards communism.</p>

        <p>Obama is also a pathological liar who told what even the left-leaning  PolitiFact conceded as <a href="https://www.texaspolicy.com/brokenpromises/">2013 lie of the year</a>. I'm sorry but don't presume to con me in saying that Obama is a stout champion for capitalism as he signed into law what probably is the most socialist piece of shit legislation to date (the ACA). His mentor was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Marshall_Davis#Works">Frank Marshall Davis</a> (a communist) and he has ties to Bill Ayers, also a radical communist. He's also the only president in my liftetime that, quite literally, because of that garbage fucking law, cost me an entire tax refund. He also famously said "you didn't build that (business)" as well as "when you spread the wealth around, it's good for everybody." So you finding one time where he deceptively and fiendishly praises capitalism I instead return to you that he is a bold-faced liar that knows how blow smoke up asses and pander for votes. <a href="https://mises.org/wire/obama-hid-his-fathers-socialism-readers">More text regarding Obama's pro-socialist write-ups</a></p>

<p>I am not saying he is a libertarian, but there is some area between libertarians and Stalinists that Obama could be placed. One of the quotes I used shows that Obama is in favor of regulating capitalism, but ultimately views markets as superior over planned economies. He is a textbook neoliberal, visit r/neoliberal and see how they criticize politicians such as AOC, they wouldnt exactly identify themselves socialist or leftist.</p>
<p>&rt;he signed into law what probably is the most socialist piece of shit legislation to date (the ACA).</p>
<p>A law that the Republicans wanted to enact, until Obama decided to do it. Again, you seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding of what socialism is. I might misremember the part where the entire healthcare system was nationalized under that law. As far as I know, healthcare in the USA is still a ruthless business, far from socialism. Under socialism, pharmaceutical companies would not be able to extort people for insulin. I do wonder though, how has the ACA affected you exactly, and how is it socialist according to you?</p>
<p>&rt;His mentor was Frank Marshall Davis (a communist)</p>
<p>Nowhere does it state he is a communist. Nothing of his work screams "communist". If civil rights for black people = communist, you would probably be living under a communist government right about now. Even if that man was a devout communist, it would not necessarily make Obama a socialist. Under Obama, inequality did not get fixed in the US at all, and the onslaught of big corporations and banks on the lower classes continued, as it should under a <strong><em>neoliberal</em></strong>. </p>
<p>Politics comes in more than two flavors, to be frank you sound as crazy as the people calling all Republicans nazis. In reality the Democrat and Republican parties are just two slightly different shades of center/center-right politics, both with their own marginalized extreme wings. You should check out the policies of left wing parties in Europe or India, if you want to see real socialist policy proposals.</p>

        <p>They were only in love with him on a surface level.  In the end, it all amounted to, 'oh, I like Ron Paul, but I voted for Obama anyways'.  It's the same way most of them are with Bernie, either capitulating and voting for the DNC plant or not voting at all because they think being a political annoyance on the internet is good enough.</p>

        <p>I don't disagree with a university's right to require vaccines, but I disagree with the "right" to require a vaccine that was still in preliminary trials less than a year ago and not formally approved by the FDA.  I also disagree with how universities and other institutions are comparing COVID vaccination requirements to polio vaccination requirements when they actually go a lot further.  Nobody has a polio vaccine passport, and there's a lot of exemptions one can make for standard vaccines that still allows them to participate in society like normal human beings.</p>

        <p>I didn't realize that having an issue with the republican party and how they govern was casting stones. I have not personally attacked anyone on this thread. If you feel personally attacked that's on you.</p>
<p>Republicans are spineless and will not stand up for the liberties that we hold dear on this sub. Sorry not sorry if that offends you.</p>

        <p>Lol. We are currently talking about a republican, That's why. I hate democrats even more. Politicians in general are shit. Just come out and admit you feel personally attacked because I shit talked your preferred party. Maybe then you will be able to see the problem with that.</p>

        <p>I think you're just bad at reading. He's saying that the decision to get the vaccine should be left to the individual, as you would expect if you know anything about Rand Paul's politics.</p>

        <p>He's still urging people to get a highly experimental vaccine that we don't even know the long term side effects are. And believe me, I know about rand Paul's politics. And if you know his father, you know that rand is a fry cry from his father's greatness.</p>
<p>Not saying rand is shit, but at the end of the day he is a politician with an r next to his name. I don't trust anyone from the major parties as far as I can throw them.</p>

        <p>No, he's not. He said that you should get the vaccine if you think you need or want it. He's urging people to make the decision for themselves whether to get the vaccine.</p>
