    <strong>No New Normal Road Trip Results</strong>
    <p><p>I went on a road trip through 8 states in hopes to find normalcy for two weeks. Here are the state by state results.</p>
<p><strong>Minnesota</strong>: Don't plan to do any recreating without wearing a mask unless you are in a very rural area. Outside of the major metro you can get away with not wearing a mask, but you may need to argue.</p>
<p><strong>Iowa:</strong> Mask mandate was lifted. I just drove through, but stopped at a couple of gas stations. Many people wearing masks, but many also not. It seemed as though everything was open. Not much more detail.</p>
<p><strong>Missouri:</strong> We spent the night in Missouri. Mandates for masks are county by county. I stayed in a county without mandates. All hotels everywhere I went said that you needed to wear a mask, but we didn't. No hot breakfasts at hotels. Just crappy bags of stuff. </p>
<p>This was the first place that we went out to dinner. COVID didn't exist. Not a single staff member or patron was wearing a mask. You can sit where you want, etc. It was the first feeling of normal.</p>
<p>We went to church in Missouri. This was interesting. We were a bit late, so it had already started and everyone was seated. Maybe 5 out of the 60 people there were wearing masks, but the priest was one of them, which was weird. With about 5 minutes left an issue came up to my wife with a box of masks. He said that we had to wear them when we left. My wife said no. He cried that it is their rules, and she said we aren't from here. People came up to us after, including the priest to say hi and thank us for coming. Nobody seemed to be concerned but the one usher. They were all wearing masks however.</p>
<p><strong>Southern Illinois</strong>: These people were completely brainwashed. Half the people at the truck stop were not wearing masks, and it seemed normal. I went into a grocery store where they had signs posted every 3 feet about do not be in here without a mask. It reeked of sanitizer. I didn't wear one, and nobody said anything, and the cashier was nice. Everyone was staring at me. </p>
<p><strong>Tennessee</strong>: We stayed the night here as in a town called Murfreesboro. The hotel wasn't concerned, and had a small superbowl party (3 guys and a bunch of food). We were late, so we didn't get to partake. I went to a bar/restaurant to pickup food. Nobody wearing masks or social distancing. Half of the staff wore masks around their chin. I went to several other stops and it was pretty normal in this area, and all over Tennessee. I did not stop in a major city.</p>
<p><strong>Kentucky</strong>: Kentucky was pretty much normal. Some people wore masks, but most didn't. There were a few stores that required them. Two stores were in the same building, and only separated by a row of shelves that were 10 ft high with 20ft ceilings. One side required masks and were nazis, and the other side didn't require or wear them themselves. It appeared that everything was open, besides seasonal shutdowns. One gas station clerk was smoking a cig inside, and of course not wearing a mask while she was ringing me up. She was still in 1994 normal, which was a nice site.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> Just like many places, everything was open. Places said to wear masks, but many people didn't. We stopped for dinner at a nicer place just outside Atlanta. Everyone but us wore masks, but nobody said anything to us. I think most people don't believe masks help, but are too nice to not wear them. In Kroger I saw one other person not wearing one.</p>
<p><strong>Florida</strong>: We stayed in Cocoa Beach. Go there! This place was normal.  Almost nobody wearing masks. Everything was open and running as normal. I forgot all about COVID. Most of the tourists there were there to escape crazy tyrants as well. </p>
<p>We also stayed in Orlando as well. People here are nuts. I saw a lady at Walmart with a complete surgical outfit on, with her masks taped up around her nose, and a faceshield. She was complaining about people not have their masks pulled all the way up until she saw my naked face. She then completely lost her shit. Nobody said a word to me. This was the biggest Walmart I have ever seen with a couple thousand people there each time. I saw two other people there total out thousands the 3 times I went there not wearing a mask as well. Still nobody said anything to me at Walmart. I went to some other stores and people were so nice. Staff and customers.</p>
<p>Overall in Florida it is pretty much open, and people don't care what you are doing. The big parks and some of stores are still nuts. I would avoid the big cities. We were at a resort in Orlando, and the other people staying were similar to us and didn't follow the rules as well. I was only not let into 1 store, and I was lightly confronted 3 times. I always just said I can't wear one, and people left me alone.</p>
<p>Hop this helps.</p></p>

        <p>Democrat state: Paronoid and scared people with strict lockdowns 
Republican state: few if any lockdowns, much less paronoia and fear among the population. </p>
<p>I have yet to come across anyone who is Democrat and isn‚Äôt scared of covid. On the flip side I‚Äôve seen a mixed bag, some Republicans are freaking out over it and some think it‚Äôs a crock of shit. You keep hearing ‚Äúthis shouldn‚Äôt be a political issue‚Äù, but that‚Äôs exactly what it is. At least in the United States anyway.</p>

        <p>I am no longer a Democrat but I was in the beginning of this and at that point I was scared. After I left the Democratic Party i had absolutely no fear LOL it completely completely dissipated once I got away from those nut cases and the constant fear mongering</p>

        <p>Quit shilling this shit. The left is evil, full stop. If your eyes are open to the evil of the masking and lockdowning, then you need to open your eyes to the rest of the evil: racial quotas, "believe all women", negative personality characteristics being attached to white skin, censorship, etc.</p>

        <p>You are taking the most extreme beliefs and attributing it to an entire group.  That's a media scam that you fell for.  Just like all the right are not actually gun toting chew chomping redneck racists. 
Media feeds you a stereotype that breeds hate and then extremists on social media feed into it, but reality is not that simple.  People on the sub I linked also complain about that same stuff you complained about too.  Maybe widen your thought processes a bit.</p>

        <p>Right. I bet you believe that the reason the left pushed mail-in voting is to be safe. If you watched what the left has done to their states and cities, and don't believe it is political, you have some sort of mental disorder and I am sorry for you.</p>

        <p>Totally agree. It was super creepy how every followed the rules, but didn't really care if the one outlier didn't. It's even worse since a large percentage are from places like Cuba or Venezuela. They are just following the rules, and not thinking about what they are doing at all.</p>

        <p>Spot on. Most people are apathetic or got bullied into compliance. The doomerism isn't as fanatical as you might think it is. The only real doomers are the people who would you expect them to be.</p>

        <p>If you went to a Catholic Church, they might be in a similar situation as us. Our diocese made masks mandatory. Where we go, the priest must oblige but the people do not. We've also been reported when people in the neighborhood saw us exiting without masks, and our chaplaincy is now being fined for letting anyone in without masks.</p>

        <p>Yes, that is the way the Diocese where I live as well. However, so is the Orlando, and both the church we went to in Orlando, and the church we go to hear are not having it, and don't follow the rules. We had to leave the church we went to for years, because they following along with rules and narrative.</p>

        <p>I did a lot of research to find the right path and places. Just remember that if it says to wear a mask, don't do it. Most still haven't heard "We can't wear them" in the places where people always do, and will let you go. We took our 5 kids, and never wore one once.</p>

        <p>I wouldn‚Äôt think you would have a problem with any of the hotels. One smelled too much like sanitizer, and the guy was wearing gloves, and a mask, so I just said it smelled too strong of sanitizer, cancelled and went next door. Next door the guy wasn‚Äôt wearing a mask, and they were lax.</p>

        <p>Good findings!</p>
<p>As an Orlando resident, people here are quite compliant with the masks but don't really bother you about it. Outside of a few militant businesses and the attractions, it's pretty lax. It's not like Los Angeles or San Francisco where people screech at you like Pod People.</p>

        <p>Your description of Missouri is accurate. Lake of the Ozarks is booming these days, and is definitely a great way to experience ‚Äúnormal‚Äù just over the weekend they had Mardi Gras and the city council‚Äôs response was people have the right to do what they want. No masks required except for in some chain locations but most local places couldn‚Äôt care less, and the cops don‚Äôt enforce much. Not necessarily the safest place if you are concerned, but if not, the lake is a great place to be right now.</p>

        <p>LOL I think you and all the ppl downvoting me misunderstood what I meant. I said you need to manage your time because you mentioned being late twice in this story. Sorry man I wasn't calling you out as a person, good to hear you're doing well!</p>

        <p>Lol. For sure. I think most people and myself were thinking that a two week trip just to see what is normal is bad time management. But yes, you are correct. We are late to everything. The battle of getting 5 kids ready too early, and them messing everything up, or too late and being late all the time. We choose late.</p>
