        <p>Trump wasn't pretending the virus didn't exist. When he wanted to close the borders the democrats went wild calling him xenophobic and racist. When he wanted to hold china accountable again they attacked him. He knew it was released from a lab. He wanted them to pay for what they did. But I stead we had the mainstream media attacking him and misrepresenting clips of him talking out of context. When he was talking about alternative therapies before the vaccine came out the news stations literally reported that he was encouraging people to drink bleach, words which never came out of his mouth. </p>
<p>I don't like any politicians but this year has really opened my eyes to how the media works in tandem with corporate and political interests to deliberately mislead the population and they eat it up like a shit sandwich</p>

        <p>So President Trump used to say "it is what it is!" (check august 2020 AXIOS interview) or this also "we have to live with it, not shut down the country or there won't be a country to open up" and was absolutely destroyed and "fact checked" by the propaganda media for not doing enough and they even said in September 2020 that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/01/health/eua-coronavirus-vaccine-history/index.html">rushing a coronavirus vaccine was "colossally stupid"</a>.</p>
<p>Now President Biden tried to be the "savior" here and... looks like the last 2 months haven't been going well for him either.</p>
