    <strong>What is Florida really like now?</strong>
    <p><p>I live in the Pacific Northwest and I feel like I am in a bad movie. My governor is a tyrant and here to even question vaccines and masks gets you called a terrorist. People complain about unmasked people yet you never actually see them. </p>
<p>So I am thinking about moving to Florida. I just wonder is it actually better. Ideally this could be best answered by someone who has been on the west coast and in Florida recently. I unfortunately have only been as far as Idaho and it is less dystopian but still in the Boise area its pretty masked up.</p>
<p>Can you live in Florida without constant condemnation if you question the narrative? Are there horrible lines outside and iron curtain setups to get into stores (like Walmart). Do people there in general hate anti maskers? Can you eat in a restaurant without reservations and waiting hours to get in?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I guess I am trying to figure out if the old normal still exists there. South Dakota is too cold or I would consider it.</p>
<p>Anyone have any thoughts on this?</p>
<p>Is Florida the last holdout of normal life in this sea of dystopia?</p></p>

        <p>The politics of the governor are fine, so we aren't locked down. </p>
<p>The politics of the health department still suck, so they contact trace schools. </p>
<p>The politics of the corporations are bad too, so masks are needed in many stores.</p>

        <p>Well I went to Florida for Christmas, specifically an hour outside of Tampa. </p>
<p>Largely, you can walk into a store without a mask and also see others repeating that.</p>
<p>Everything is open, including bars, restaurants, amusement parks, and so on (although some amusement parks require masks). </p>
<p>Comparatively, now that I’m back home in Denver, there’s no indoor dining, and you’ll be the only person walking into a store without a mask. Amusement parks have been closed for a year, as have clubs. Bars are off and on.</p>

        <p>I’m in a Orlando right now but spent a few days at the beach too. The whole state is open. Theaters, parks, stores, restaurants etc. Over in Brevard co the stores say mask mandate but way more lax. I didn’t wear a mask the whole time I was there and there were a ton like me. A restaurant I went in, even the servers weren’t wearing them. </p>
<p>Now In Orlando, everybody wears them. Even outside (morons) I was the only one I saw in my hotel, at Target, the Outlets not wearing one. So some might be more uncomfortable with that. We did Disney so we definitely had to wear it there, even outside around nobody. That sucked. I won’t go back til they don’t require masks.</p>

        <p>I can't comment on Florida but I want to say you have my full support leaving WA state, or Oregon, but I'm gonna assume it's the latter. I left WA last July because the lockdowns and the deterioration of the downtown area made Seattle less enjoyable. All the places that kept me sane closed. And I didn't like the idea that people looked at you funny for not wearing a mask outside. </p>
<p>The West coast in general has a mountain of economic problems ahead that in my opinion are gonna be exacerbated by the response to Covid and other policies. Honestly the West Coast and NYC are probably places I'd suggest people leave. I know Inslee and Newsom keep tightening restrictions with no end in sight. I can't comment on Oregon but it's probably no better there.</p>
<p>It's pretty open in the SE in general compared to many places of the country. I've heard from several co-workers who know people that went to Florida recently and it seems life is relatively normal there.</p>

        <p>Objectively speaking, there are good reasons to relocate to Florida aside from Covid restrictions. With no personal income tax and low property taxes, state and local governments won’t bleed you dry in taxes.</p>

        <p>They don't even make you get your car inspected. It's the only state I lived in that didn't require it. </p>
<p>They did switch to a verified driver's license years ago. I was in the middle of a name change, so my new SSN card was in transit. It was a fucking nightmare because nothing I showed them was good enough because of the damn name change from getting married. But a lot of other states have the same thing.</p>

        <p>I’m visiting down there in a couple days. I recently asked what things are like on this sub. The answers I got, It’s seems like it’s better than a lot of places. Most things seem to be open, masks are somewhat required depending on where, but overall it’s pretty normal life.</p>

        <p>It depends on which part. Some cities like Miami have local ordinances with restrictions. There’s no state overall restrictions though so just depends on which city you’re talking about.</p>

        <p>I am in central florida. I still go into the grocery store and walmart and don't wear a mask. 9/10 or more have masks on, but once in a while you see a sane person without a mask, even mothers with small children without masks sometimes. No one has ever bothered me yet for not wearing one, though employees ask you to wear one when you walk in store in some places. I just smile at them and keep on moving.</p>
