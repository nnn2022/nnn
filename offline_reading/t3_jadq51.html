    <strong>A List of Things I am No Longer Doing</strong>
    <p><ul>
<li>Pretending I give a shit about passing the virus on to others. The truth is that I do not give a fraction of a shit. Not even the tiniest brown smudge of a skidmark. If anyone asks me if I care about other people getting sick, I respond with "No, not really."</li>
<li>Accepting hand sanitizer at stores. I will not be treated like some diseased sack of flesh upon entering your establishment with the intent to spend money. Sit down.</li>
<li>Participating in any Zoom call or virtual event except as required by my job. The virtual happy hour invites have disappeared (maybe because I'm such a miserable troll?) but it seems like every week I get an email to run a \~virtual race\~. The best one was where they'd give you a MASK for signing up. The glory! Praise be to our Lord Fauci. I revel in the opportunity to pay money to run on a public street which I could just do for free and receive a sacred face cloth for my efforts.</li>
<li>Explaining why I am wearing a mesh mask/no mask. I have issues. I'm getting help for these issues. These issues are also no one's business, least of all the cashier at Publix. I do not owe anyone an explanation for why it is hard for me to wear a mask. </li>
<li>Socializing where masks are required. I recently left a group setting where there were 3 of us indoors and we were required to wear masks (church group). I said I couldn't do this anymore and I got up and left. Their masks were large and stupid and looked like flappy bra cups strapped to their faces, and I couldn't get past the urge to punch them. </li>
<li>Patronizing any business that is overly combative with mask signage. I understand most businesses are required to post propaganda about masks, but it's clear some are going above and beyond to all but threaten anyone who does not comply. Well, get fucked.  I'd <em>almost</em> rather sit through a Zoom date than willfully spend money in an establishment that resents the fact that I walked in. If you're so scared, crawl back into the neckbeard nest from whence you came. </li>
</ul>

<p>No one gave a shit about this until March.  On February 28th, if you would have asked 99999/100000 people if they would wear a mask so a random grandma would not get the flu that neither of them have, there is literally no chance they would have done this.  None.  Maybe we should wear knee pads and helmets at all times too, so no one ever gets hurt ever.</p>

<p>1 study, out for peer review, said they found it in stool samples form Europe back in April of 2019. This shit has been around awhile.</p>

        <p>I'm fairly certain I got it after going to a gigantic tech conference in San Francisco late November 2019. Had the weirdest cough for like 2 months that just would not go away, it felt like my lungs were crackling whenever I took deep breaths.</p>

        <p>I had it when I was traveling in Asia back in late December, early January. I'm nearly 100% positive, although I lack proof via tests. All the symptoms were the same, and it was a relatively rough cold for me (I can't remember ever having that kind of cough or phlegm in my chest while breathing), but it by no means slowed me down. I came back to the US by the end the 2nd week of January. Just think of the thousands other Americans who likely had the same itinerary as me who would have came back with the virus.</p>
<p>Also, I was in Japan or South Korea when I started becoming symptomatic. It was very far from Wuhan. Given the delay in developing symptoms, time-wise, it would actually check out that I could have gotten the virus in an airport in America or at home in the Bay Area before I even left. (I was only in Japan for a few days, and it was my first stop. The asymptomatic period can be up to a week.)</p>

        <p>&rt;If anyone asks me if I care about other people getting sick, I respond with "No, not really."</p>
<p>To the extent that I could be bothered to give a legit response, I would point out that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I am not sick.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because I am asymptomatic, I am at lower risk of being contagious, as proven by the science showing that disease severity is correlated with viral shedding.  If I am healthy with no symptoms, I am very unlikely to be out here spreading this freely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are concerned with catching the disease from secret lepers waiting to infect you everywhere you go, what are you doing out here in public accosting me about it instead of staying home?  How can I can get you sick if you're in your house and I am not?  Isn't the fact that our paths have crossed in public an indication that, hey, you might not be "taking this as seriously" as you claim in the name of convenience and a desire for normal human functioning?  We are not so different.</p>

        <p>Exactly right there with you. 
Also
I will no longer wear anything that is actually a mask. I wear a headband/gaiter around my neck just in case some maniac starts yelling at me in a store. 
I will no longer hold any sort of conversation with someone in a muzzle. 
I will no longer watch/read/follow anything that promotes the muzzles.</p>

        <p>I wear noise cancelling headphones in public 99% of the time due to my misophonia, I've been doing this for years. I basically just ignore everyone in public. If you can't see my gigantic earphones on, I don't think you have anything intelligent to say to me anyways.</p>

        <p>I only ever use a neck gaiter, I've never worn a mask once since this whole thing started and I'm in CA. At least the neck gaiters look somewhat normal and not like I'm in some horrible medical nightmare. The masks, particularly some of them and the way people wear them, literally do look like muzzles, and these people walk around outside with them, often with sunglasses also, so you literally can't see any part of their face. It's so fucking depressing and dystopian, I'm so over it.</p>

        <p>This plandemic just further my resolve on not eating out. I am 100% against the idea of (somewhat) forced tipping. We are basically being told we need to pay the waiter's salary so the owner can pay them $2 an hour. It's insane and I won't be part of it. The prices are insane now anyways. Sit down and eat a burger and fries with a beer= $50 after tip, easily, even at Applebees. </p>
<p>Grab a burger, fries and beer at a hamburger stand and eat it on a picnic table outside= $20 max.</p>

        <p>You do realize that their wages would be priced in if there weren’t tips, right?  I mean you pay their wages either way. </p>
<p>Also, they aren’t exempt from minimum wage laws. Management would have to cover if they come in under whatever it is.</p>

        <p>Yes, was that not clear in my comment? I said I don't want to pay their wage for the restaurant owner. I don't like the system, therefore I refuse to participate. I still get food out, I just don't give sit down restaurants my business. I refuse to pay the waiter's salary.</p>

        <p>Deleted mine 7 years ago. If you want to know your true friends, it's a great test. Not counting family, probably 5 or 6 of my hundreds of "friends" even bothered to reach out once I left facebook. And I let people know I was deleting it too, I put up a post for about 2 weeks telling people to please email or text me after such and such date. And I gave my contact info.</p>

        <p>Oh same!! I logged out around May. The protest hypocrisy was my last straw. I was fearing for my sanity when everyone was claiming BLM protests didn't spread the virus, but any other group gathering of more than 10 did. I was actually hopeful it would prove Covid wasn't the boogeyman they had been saying, but that was hopelessly naive and squashed within a millisecond</p>

        <p>One other thing I noticed was that—for me at least—deleting the app and just going through internet on the rare occasion I wanted to check in had the added benefit of landing me on my personal updates, NOT on my newsfeed.  Don’t know if that would be the case for everyone, but it’s honestly been really nice to not instantly get roped into debate and doom the minute I log on.</p>

        <p>I'm right with you on this. I've been amazed at the shift in my life now that I'm not able to commute. My panic attacks, my rage attacks, even my frustration - these are not worth coddling someone else's fear. I will not cover my face, and I will avoid people who do as much as I can. I'm changing the businesses I deal with. Places I used to patronize weekly, daily, etc., will never see my money again. I'm not worried about dying, or anyone else. I've had close friends die of this virus and I've had more people die of suicide since the lockdown. I will never wear a mask. Whenever possible, I say, "I can't hear you clearly, and I cannot read your expression Please uncover your mouth so I can read your lips."</p>
<p>So I've stopped "caring" and started <em>caring</em>. I have a very small number of people who are actually important in my life. I care about that small number of people and I do whatever I can to help them be happy and satisfied. Granted, I've cut down that number due to politics and current beliefs.</p>
<p>I am in the bare minimum of online meetings - Discord RPGs are about my limit.</p>
<p>My feeling is that if you are sick, or if you are terrified of being sick, quarantine yourself. Your fear and your sickness should never override my liberty.</p>

        <p>This so much. In the UK footballers are fined and humiliated for wearing a fucking poppy on the football kit, but it’s absolutely fine to take the knee over and over and over again. That and the lack of atmosphere from grounds. The game just feels soulless, passionless, almost like a training match.</p>

        <p>I occasionally get pizza from a popular local place in the downtown where I live. The last two times I’ve picked up an order in the evening, the staff wasn’t wearing masks.

        <p>There's a pizza place I went to fairly recently where it looked like the staff pretty much went maskless despite the signs on the door (mandated by the state).</p>
<p>If it wasn't about 45 minutes away from me, I'd tell everyone I knew that thought like me to hit it up.</p>

        <p>A couple of bars have resorted to similar signage in my area. Fucktards are either reporting people for not wearing masks, or undercover liquor agents are going into them. A couple of bars in my area got their liquor licenses pulled.</p>
<p>It has completely turned me against the general idea of a liquor license, the government shouldn't be able to hold all this bullshit over their heads just because they serve alcohol.</p>

<p>I was able to move from a metro-area back to my rural hometown in June and its like night and day.  The only places you can even notice a difference are National businesses like Walmart, Chilis, Autozone etc.</p>
<p>I guarantee the Managers don't actually give a damn, they just don't want corporate giving them trouble for not following their procedures.</p>
<p>We've actually had quite a few cases too, its not like we aren't familiar with the virus.  We just accept the fact that its not worth destroying community trying to avoid the inevitable cases.</p>

        <p>I try not to go anywhere that is "open with restrictions" and have resorted to over shopping once or twice a month to avoid grocery stores as much as possible. I refuse to take part in anything that requires a time slot or masks or is capacity restricted unless I have to. My recreation has turned into only outdoors and driving in my car. Also I refuse to do business with any business that will not take cash or did not for a time due go Covid. Looking at you Dutch Bros. I may falter on some of my ideals but that last one is a total deal breaker.</p>

&rt;Same here. I will not comply with the mask guidelines to go to the effing hiking trails and walk in the woods in the fresh air, so instead I go to the neighborhood park and walk on a loop, where people leave me alone. I thank the powers that be every single day that I am not in a position where I am willing to try to force this absurdity on others.<br>

<p>The whole thing makes my blood boil honestly so I try not to think about it, these policies wouldn’t have been passed if they didn’t have massive media propaganda outlets pushing them. The real problem is the media, this lockdown is just a symptom of that. If it wasn’t lockdown they’d be pushing something else.</p>

        <p>China, I saw on a pbs program. They are claiming success with it. The app will alert you days later if someone you literally crossed paths in the street later becomes sick. So you can then quarantine yourself (more likely chinese authorities are then quarantining the people, but the show did not say it).</p>

        <p>I feel the same way as your first point. Yes, if I have symptoms of anything, I will stay home and self-isolate. If I don’t have symptoms of an illness, I’m going out and doing as I please. I don’t care about the microscopic chance that I’m feeling fine but will surely pass corona on to someone’s third cousin’s immune compromised father. </p>
<p>I reject pretty much all virtual event invites. We even stopped virtual happy hours at work for the most part because attendance fell off as the weeks went on. When I have tried to go to things away from work that are virtual, I find them to be a poor substitute for the real thing and quickly lose interest. </p>
<p>I hate the edgy signs about masks, and it seems like it’s done as nothing more than a ploy so businesses can cry for social media attention about how hard they have it so people feel bad for them and set up GoFundMes for servers who didn’t get tips. I don’t condone treating staff badly, but it’s clear sometimes it’s a money and pity grab.</p>

        <p>Eating out, I have always refused to wear a mask outdoors, doubly so while exercising. Pretending to care or that I have some sort of moral social obligation to care more about everyone around me than myself. Hiding the fact I'm a moderate, atheist, vegetarian, hippie who will be voting for Trump. Procrastinating my move out of this shit state I'm currently in (NM) to a state with some semblance of choice and freedom.

        <p>I've just stopped giving a fuck, you know? Like in the past, I tried to accept that deaths were bad and to be avoided, but I've gone totally down the 'why don't we just triage this shit since most of the people who die have had a good innings anyway.' </p>
<p>The only one that I'm doing that you're not anymore is a virtual happy hour because there are only two people in our group that have zoom premium. That's why most of them have disappeared, because zoom used to offer free calls on friday and saturday nights but has now stopped. Mine goes on for an average of about 7 hours so 40 mins doesn't cut it.</p>

        <p>Here's things I don't do and have never done:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't wear mask in school. In language class in college we need to see each other's faces, so wearing a mask isn't acceptable to me. If the law changed I would file a complaint. Call me a Karen, but I may actually qualify for a medical exempt and as a Nordic person I takes the name back.</li>
<li>I don't wear mask when going to the club with my college friends. Many of the people we knows are Hoh/Deaf and needs to read our lips.</li>
<li>I don't pretend to understand what masked people are saying. Especially not teachers.</li>
<li>I don't care about being an easy person as long I'm polite about it. It's okay to ask masked people to write things down if I can't hear what they're saying.</li>

        <p>I understand not patronizing businesses in the US, but if you live somewhere with a mask mandate, you should go out of your way to support them. They've suffered enough already and some of them are going overboard with the propaganda out of fear they'll be shut down.</p>
