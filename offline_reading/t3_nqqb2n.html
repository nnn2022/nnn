    <strong>The Movie "Abigail" on Amazon Prime is a based view of Hypochondria Fascism in a steampunk world. (Suggestions for Covid New Normal Related Entertainment Thread)</strong>
    <p><p>It's not the greatest film ever, and the voice dubbing - even though the cast speaks English - is worthy of a 70's ninja movie... Definitely more "Family Oriented" fantasy.</p>
<p>But the premise is so anti-new-normal it's amazing. I have no idea how they snuck this through Hollywood. The opening lines of the movie reveal that the world is locked down by a virus that has no symptoms, and can only be detected with special equipment. The infected are immediately isolated and killed...</p>
<p>I know there was that one other movie, Songbird...</p>
<p>Anyone else have any recommendations?</p></p>
