        <p>I FEEL YA ON THAT!!! Oh, I get it, you're just warning folks?</p>
<p>Every job around me (Colorado Springs, CO, USA) mandates masks even if the potential employee has a medical condition barring the use of them. "My options are decreasing mostly rapidly" (Sting) so I found myself with two children and no income. I found less than legit work, thankfully. Otherwise I'd have zero prospects.</p>

        <p>FAKE JOB ALERT IN CANADA! üö®üö®üö®
Be aware, I found them on Indeed and I found it very sketchy that‚Äôs why I was so cautious and I was right.
From what I understood, the job offer was a Customer‚Äôs Representative for Kingmark (Canada) but when I emailed ‚ÄúVanessa J‚Äù or ‚ÄúVanessa Jacobs‚Äù, the company name suddenly became Novator System.</p>
<p>I entertained ‚Äúher‚Äùemail even though I already knew the tea üçµ.  She let me sign some personal details that can be useful on unlocking someone‚Äôs personal bank account or for identity theft. Obviously, I did not give all the right info. The job offer has a 7-day screening period and I will be payed handsomely depending if I choose full-time or part-time. I chose full-time.</p>
<p>The explained task for this job was to buy softwares, online tools, stocks for the clients, etc. using ‚ÄúBitcoin wallet‚Äù and to communicate with them. They are going to give you an account to load with Bitcoin from a software that they are going to provide. Then they are going to e-transfer/ give you a cheque for the expenses which we obviously all know that cheques can bounce back. </p>
<p>Today was supposed to be my first day at work for training and this person immediately asked for my ID, front and back photo, which is very unusual if you are an employer. I lied and made a story that I am not at home and I don‚Äôt have my ID with me and asked if it‚Äôs okay if I send it later when I come home. The person declined and said they need it for employer record  purposes. I confronted the scammer and the guilty blocked me.
The entire conversation is included below.</p>
<p>PLEASE BE AWARE OF THESE SHAMS! 
I HOPE THE REST OF US CAN GET THROUGH ALL THE LOSES THAT WE HAD BECAUSE OF THIS GLOBAL TRAGEDY. BE ALERT, FOR PEOPLE ARE MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE VIRUS! üö®üö®üö®</p>
