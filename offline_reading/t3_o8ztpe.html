    <strong>A lot of the people on here and out protesting have had their lives ruined by the new normal. What do you expect them to do? Be happy about it? Shut up and take it?</strong>
    <p><p>Fucking fed up of seeing comments on other subs that dare to post videos of the anti-lockdown protests absolutely ripping into the people there and claiming it's a "super spreader" event. Let's ignore the fact that they wouldn't dare do the same for BLM for a moment and bring up the fact that probably most of the people at the protests have had their lives absolutely FUCKED because of this shit. Otherwise why would they be protesting? </p>
<p>Maybe they know someone who's committed suicide; maybe they've come close to doing it themselves because of the mental strain this fucking bullshit has had on them the past year. Maybe they had a business that has gone belly up and they're burning through their savings and can't put bread on the table for their family? Tough shit for them, I guess, right? Maybe they've had a bad reaction to the vaccine or someone they know has (or died after having it)? You fucking bastards like to claim you're so empathetic yet you can't even fucking consider what might drive someone to protest this shit in the first place.</p>
<p>I'd have a lot more fucking respect for you doomers if you were just fucking honest about why you love lockdowns, social distancing and face-diapers. It's not because you "trust the Science" or out of some altruistic, empathetic need to save the elderly and vulnerable. It's because you're asocial wankers who never had lives to begin with. You have lost nothing the past year; but you have gained plenty of Reddit karma and internet adulation for following the rules and shitting on anti-maskers.</p></p>

        <p>It apparently is not transmitted indoors as well considering that we have had someone with CoVid breathing in the face of their significant other since they sleep in the same bed and that second person DOES NOT catch CoVid or SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>It is ridiculous now. Either CoVid is damned hard to catch in the real world and is NOT an airborne virus or there is more to transmission indoors.</p>

<p>I got into it with people IRL and on comment boards about exactly this  ⬆️point starting May-June 2020 and haven’t let up. They have indeed proved their “empathy” goes as far as their tribe of wanking co-doomers, most of whom were probably white collar workers that weren’t affected because they could “work from home” or received fat compensation for sitting on their asses spreading doomism on their laptops.</p>

        <p>Wanna know the secret? Those calling others 'superspreaders' and keeping this whole covid19 Mask-LARPing BS going are getting PAID.</p>
<p>Yep PAID. And handsomely too by Covid19 benefit packages of all types. By keeping the fear going, by baby-birding on social media and claiming to government "We'll be homeless if you stop our Covid benefits! We could die! ,etc" they have every motivation to keep this going.</p>
<p>People who CANT AFFORD to stay home and be locked down and restricted, and who's lives and businesses have been gimped and destroyed (or will be hobbled for years, like after 2008 recession) DONT WANT TO STAY HOME. THEY WANT TO GET BACK TO WORK.</p>
<p>So I've come up with an answer to the "When will Canadians be done with this?" As "When they can no longer AFFORD to" and that's what it boils down to.</p>

        <p>I hope so too. She sold the place and moved back in with her mom. I'm still pissed off that this is what the new normal leads to and I wish I didn't comply so much back then.

        <p>The new voter base that's all it is and to distract from the fact we no longer need the population , pensions or money .
money is just a slice of worth the elite have very limited cash and its all in assets.
if the financial system collapses assets will be untouched where as dollars with no real value will plummet .
so when people make the argument that this is conspiracy why would they crash the economy its simple population reduction roll in the automation.</p>
<p>pay the young morons ubi and   kill off the older generation who remember the way it was  . Ww1,ww2 all the same .
truth is people believe governments and countries exist when they are just characters in a story .
the truman show is real but everyone is truman and only the guys behind the camera are in reality ,
 Sounds crazy right exactly .</p>
<p>Picture any micro environment work for example you have the grunts , the supervisors the managers the ceo and finally the shareholders. The supervisors know certain things that are underhanded  and as you go up complicity reveals more of the truth .</p>
<p>Why do you think so many powerful people are into kids and worse that's alot of leverage 
 believing in the devil and satanism ensures no religious conviction will martyr out the truth </p>
<p>A few people have however and that's the only clue we have to put this together , not so much the statements themselves but the aftermath .
all news and media in unison debunking and ridicule , bought experts   and judges and suspicious death . </p>
<p>Now in this situation i sound crazy, of course cognitive dissonance .</p>
<p>You can say </p>
<p>•No evidence </p>
<p>•Debunked by this expert</p>
<p>•Self policing by lazy thinking majority for reasons stated.</p>
<p>•Proven in court </p>
<p>•How would the whole world keep it a secret </p>
<p>•Even movies betray the conspiracy theorist a pariah and weirdo</p>
<p>They put truth in movies too so if i say this is what happening it sounds even more crazy </p>
<p>The whole world is owned  by a group</p>
<p>They only need to control the ceos ,judges ,media, scientists </p>
<p>You cannot win even as an expert in your field they can silence you one way or the other</p>
<p>And that is why trying to censor anti-vax or covid deniers is a slippery slope and you are the enemy .</p>

        <p>I wish we had some protests, at least England has some. Why am I having to follow all these people from England on Twitter. Maybe the South is free here and just decided they didn't give a shit, and most people down there are living normal? I haven't been able to travel down there. A friend in Florida seems to be living the same as always.  I tried to find some people against this stuff except one woman locally in a health food store I plan to give more business to. The "vulnerable" [me] got more screwed over by this whole mess. I'm planning to hang out in most redneck/hillbilly areas I can find to see some normalacy. I miss my old town, they have the lowest vaxx rate in the state.</p>

        <p>&rt;It's not because you "trust the Science" or out of some altruistic, empathetic need to save the elderly and vulnerable. It's because you're asocial wankers who never had lives to begin with. You have lost nothing the past year; but you have gained plenty of Reddit karma and internet adulation for following the rules and shitting on anti-maskers.</p>
