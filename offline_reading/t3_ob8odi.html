<title>You will never get sincere commiserations or condolences from a doomer for anything but a Covid death. Hell, they'll barely acknowledge the side effects of lockdowns and rushed "vaccines". They have insane tunnel vision.</title>

        <p>Estimated 9 million people die of hunger every year.  100% preventable, and food donations don't cause blood clots or myocarditis.  Perfectly illustrates the doomer hypocrisy that they don't mention this once.</p>
<p>9 millon and not a fucking thing done.  1 granny dies, and society must upend itself.</p>

        <p>Local subway was getting ready to toss bread at the end of the night. Friend and I asked if we could have it to take to the soup kitchen for bread/croutons. They said they arenâ€™t allowed to do that because of litigation fears. </p>
<p>How screwed up is our world when a food franchise throws out bread when so many people are going hungry. Grocery stores too. Itâ€™s shameful.</p>

        <p>A lot of their argument comes down to "those people chose to kill themselves", which conveniently ignores all the people who didn't choose to have their doctor's appointments cancelled, or their business closed, or their house taken away. And even though suicide is a "choice" (their words), doesn't it bother them at all that a significant proportion of our population is so afraid for their future that they are making that choice?</p>
