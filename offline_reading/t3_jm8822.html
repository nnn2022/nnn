    <strong>It's hard to believe, but the NWO actually are far more scared than we are</strong>
    <p><p>This is something I have recently been convinced of from the works of <a href="https://twitter.com/TomMontalk/with_replies">Tom Montalk</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/TomMontalk/with_replies">Matthew Stephen</a> and <a href="https://veilofreality.com/articles/">Bernhard Guenther</a>.</p>
<p>The operations of the NWO are surreptitious and clandestine. They prefer to stay in the shadows and take one little step at a time. They have been at it for hundreds if not thousands of years and they have never shown any hurry.</p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p>Something changed and they are now suddenly desperate to implement their wet dream of a global communist technocracy within the next year or so. This kind of haste is very uncharacteristic of them and it means only one thing:</p>
<h1>They are scared af and they know they are losing control.</h1>
<p>Otherwise they wouldn't risk being exposed. And getting exposed is exactly what's happening to them, because every day thousands of people are waking up to  conspiracy reality - way ahead of their time.</p>
<h1>Keep faith. Have trust in the Divine Plan. Ignore the shallow and the obvious. There IS order in this chaos.</h1></p>

        <p>That's true, they are dying. But more than that, 2020 is a very specific year. If their objective was only political/economical they'd have implemented their agendas in random years, whenever they were ready. Just like Hitler or Stalin did.</p>
<p>But choosing 2020 over all the other years, confirms us their hidden and deep religious connotations. Just like the Pizzagate scandal, the Hillary Clinton's cult of Moloch, the rituals with children on Jeffrey Epstein's Island, or the hidden messages in the dollar bills about the Twin Towers... they are a Satanic Cult, not just normal freemasonry (some of my uncles are freemasons, members of lodges in South America, and they tell us that there are a lot of branches and masonic groups deviated from the main values, Integrity, Friendship, Respect and Charity, which instead opted for power and power and power and power at any cost).</p>

        <p>On december 21 2020 there's gonna be a Great Conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn. Saturn will be just 0.1° next to Jupiter in the sky. This hasn't happened so close since 1623. </p>
<p>On the dollar bill you have the "Novus Ordo Seclorum" thing, the phrase is taken from a book of Virgil, "A new order of the ages, the return of Saturn's reign"</p>

        <p>I think the main issue is as mentioned that they are losing time, people are rioting and are standing up and are more awake then ever (which is good for us but of course bad for them)... one question that immediately comes to my mind is, will they be successful in implementing the great reset?</p>

        <p>I have to say that, if the armies are rolled out to shoot at the masses when economic and social meltdown really starts to happen to protect those leaders implementing the Great Reset, there might be a small (at least i hope so) chance that those militaries could turn against the national leaders that are pro NWO and overthrow them Ceaucescu like, if that happens in a few countries, it could trigger a domino effect, and the NWO elites would be definitevely dismantled. A lot of soldiers are very hesitant to shot at their own people and often relate to their problems. Sadly, i doubt it as institutions of various countries are all protecting them. Probably nothing short of a civil war can stop them, also this war needs to won.</p>

        <p>Hopefully, I think we need Jesus, he is the only one who can save us.</p>
<p>AlQaeda and Terrorism achieved two purposes: 1) Emotionally manipulate the whole population 2) Make an excuse for an absurd increment in the U.S. Army Budget. 0.7 trilion dollars on average since 2003. That money wasn't wasted, but destined to create thousands of U.S. military bases around the world. Under the excuse of "fighting terrorism".</p>
<p>In South America we've tried thousands of times to dismantle this corrupt elite, who has been governing us since 1850, with the first U.S. interventions... around 1930 communism flourished naturally in all South America, everyone was simply fucking tired of inequality and of the corrupt and imperialist elites, certainly communism would have helped us. Chile was the first time when communism won democratically without a single death, pure peace and love, and then U.S.A. started sabotaging food trucks, damaging electricity stations, and on 11 September 1973 the U.S.A. bombed Chile and put Augusto Pinochet in place... in the rest of South America was similar, dictatorships, drug cartels, far right terrorist armies... all of them funded by the U.S. it's very hard to win this, if not impossible.</p>
<p>I will leave you this following verse:</p>
<p><strong>Ephesians 6:12</strong>, KJV: "For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places."</p>
<p>We need Jesus a lot these days, he's the only one who can save us. He's always knocking, we need to let him in and fill us with his grace and power, always in his name.</p>

        <p>Wasn’t there some big astrological event or alignment that has recently began shifting? Idk much about the theory...something about a big event that will encourage the enlightenment of people — and then more people will “wake up”? (But not in the “woke” sense of the word, obvs. Lol)</p>

        <p>There were several important astrological events this year; Saturn-Pluto, Jupiter-Pluto, and Jupiter-Saturn conjunctions namely. I'm guessing it's the Jupiter-Saturn conjunction you are referring to. Not only is it once every 20 year event, it is also changing elements in a 200 year cycle. For the last 200 years every time these planets were conjunct it took place in an Earth sign (think material matters, money, infrastructure, etc.), Starting December 21st they will now occur in Air signs (technology, communication, travel, etc) every 20 years. We will be shifting away from the industrial focus of the last 200 years and enter a period of technological exploration.</p>

        <p>From the article I liked in my other comment: </p>
<p>"In December of 2020, we are in for the beginning of a new age, [as] Saturn and Jupiter will be aligning in the sign of Aquarius," astrologer Aaya Samadhi tells Bustle. "This alignment is so significant because it means we’ll continue to have these two planets come together in air signs until 2059." This alignment is in contrast to the intense Capricorn stellium that took place back in January (and kicked off the rise of global pandemic), during which Jupiter, Saturn, and several other significant points and planets were clustered together in rule-oriented Capricorn.</p>
<p>But the energy that these planets will express through an air sign like Aquarius differs greatly from the traditional and authoritative vibe they brought forth in Capricorn, which is the sign they resided in during the start of the year. "Air signs represent intellect and ideas, and Aquarius is the sign of innovation, technology, and revolution," Samadhi says. While this alignment is unarguably going to be intense, the Aquarian focus on collective well-being, logical thought, and innovative growth feels like a breath of fresh air — and it could deliver some much-needed glimmers of hope for the future.</p>
<p>"This great conjunction will spark the beginning of many new advancements in technology, medicine, and ideas — and we’ll also see a spotlight on more humanitarian issues, since Aquarius is the sign of the humanitarian," Samadhi says. "If you thought humanitarian issues came to the forefront in 2020, you can expect a lot more after the Saturn and Jupiter in Aquarius alignment this December."</p>

        <p>I have a deep problem with ideas about "divine plans".  Essentially, if you simply believe everything will work out for the best, why do any work?  Participation in creating a new paradigm is essential.  Whatever forces are in power will remain in power unless an alternative is created.  These things do not create themselves.  Be open to doing genuine outreach and perhaps make the new world manifest in yourself.</p>

        <p>They arent immortal. He means the agendas, bloodlines, dynasties, and secret groups that been carrying on for hundreds and thousands of years. </p>
<p>Currently when a nation wakes up and tries the become fully independent, they use americas military to invade and "bring freedom" to make countries get in line or to just destabilize them so they don't have power anymore, or force a color revolution and install a puppet. Recent examples are germany, iraq, syria, ect.</p>
<p>Its always the same lol</p>
<p>I think what they fear is the truth and many nations waking up at the same time, because they wouldn't be able to keep their grasp</p>

<p><strong>I'm a Christian, but IMO, let's leave religion out of this, god has nothing to do with this, he must be busy creating other universes, or whatever.

        <p>I agree on you, all religions are on the same boat with us. Buddhism, Muslims, Taoists... But, sadly not all my friend. </p>

<p>remember these verses from Ephesians 6:</p>
<p>"<strong>10</strong> Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. <strong>11</strong> Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes. <strong>12</strong> For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places."</p>
<p>Also Psalm 91:</p>
<p>"<strong>1</strong> Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most Highwill rest in the shadow of the Almighty.[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+91&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-15397a">a</a>] <strong>2</strong> I will say of the Lord, “He is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.” <strong>3</strong> Surely he will save you from the fowler’s snare and from the deadly pestilence. <strong>4</strong> He will cover you with his feathers,and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness will be your shield and rampart. <strong>5</strong> You will not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that flies by day, <strong>6</strong> nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness, nor the plague that destroys at midday. <strong>7</strong> A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you. <strong>8</strong> You will only observe with your eyes and see the punishment of the wicked."</p>

        <p>Holy fuck this sub has really started going off the rails...if there is any conspiracy happening it is the apparent infiltration of this and similar subs by what I would have to assume are committed Doomers attempting to discredit any subs questioning the lockdown "science"...or just very confused and historically ignorant conspiracy theorists desperate for some easily identified and convenient "cabal" of evil doers to explain all the scary and confusing events going on in the world! If you truly think that there are shadowy figures running the world behind the scenes with some organized and millenniums old plan then you should trust said people to handle this virus with all their collective experience and power to shape world events...lmao! It is exactly that there is no "plan" or capable leadership whether in politics, science or academia that makes it necessary to question the fear mongering and dangerous societal experimentations going on! The reason why I do not trust the government to handle really anything much less a deadly viral outbreak is the very fact that there are no real "experts" or "enlightened" political leaders...just a bunch of very human and very normal assholes like all of us with no fucking game plan or clue as to what the proper course of action may be in any given circumstance or any grasp on the chaotic and confusing world we all live in. This fantasy shit of having some secret knowledge and being more "woke" then others and seeing what "they" (whoever the fuck THEY are) are planning is the same arrogant and pathetic mentality of the "doomer" who "understands the science" while the rest of us idiots are just "sheeple"! If this type of ridiculous shit is what we are going to be discussing and the mods are allowing then count me out...Im looking to discuss the serious economic, societal and health consequences of the uniformed and panic driven response to Covid-19 not ridiculous conspiracy theories!</p>
