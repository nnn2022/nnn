<p>Starting early today for more of your daily depression.</p>

<p>About the source: it’s NY Times, what do you expect? That Nicholas Kristof guy seems to be having a hard time too, from his list of entries he seems to go between calling out moral injustices and having an internal struggle as to whether or not America can actually cooperate.</p>
<p>Fuck it, opinion time.</p>
<p>Well this one really goes without saying, you have cities like New York, Dubai, Hong Kong, Tokyo, London, etc. where it’s an urban environment and everyone is stacked like sardines, and then you have low pop rural villages that are turned into internment camps just the same by their corrupt governments, because everyone in the north and west is being told this is morally right, no one will bat an eye if we starve some of the most struggling people on the planet. Of course you had groups dedicated to feeding people there, providing healthcare, and volunteering to clean up the streets no one was paying money to get done, but now that’s a crime. Is it obvious I’m getting progressively more pissed?</p>
