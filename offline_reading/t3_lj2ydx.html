    <strong>Question on the virus.</strong>
    <p><p>So I’ve got a question for everyone here. I recently shifted from being a Republican to an independent because of conflicting views on covid. It seems like when the left is doing something to spread it the virus is real. But when the right is doing something similar then the virus is a hoax. The vaccine is bad if it’s mandatory. But it’s a travesty the front line workers aren’t being provided with it. So I was wondering if someone could clarify all of this? Because I’d really like to say I’m a proud Republican to my family again but I need to get our views on this thing straight first. So I thought this might help. Thank you in advance everyone!</p></p>

        <p>Stop with the left vs right - Republican vs Democrat illusion. They’re just different wings on the same bird. As long as you continue looking at things that way, you will continue to be misguided. You need to take it a step up and find out who is controlling them.</p>

        <p>Stop wanting to call yourself a proud republican and call yourself a proud American ffs.  Both parties pander to their base while enlarging the government, their power, and their bank accounts </p>
<p>You are on the right track searching for truth.  You will find it. And then you won’t be able to unlearn it</p>

        <p>I personally don’t feel it’s a travesty if front line workers aren’t the very first. The whole goal should be to protect the vulnerable and front line workers typically aren’t vulnerable. By vulnerable I mean the demographic that is impacted the most by the virus and that is the elderly. I’m not even sure the “vaccine” is necessary for the elderly because of its limited testing. </p>
<p>From what I see it’s not necessarily the travesty that front line workers aren’t being provided the vaccine but it’s the hypocrisy of the roll out / distribution. But take my POV with a grain of salt.</p>

        <p>Political affiliation is irrelevant - I know people from all walks of life with wide-ranging viewpoints.</p>
<p>Me: 
I lean Democrat, I don't think the virus is a hoax, I don't think masks are inherent evil, I don't think the vaccine is inherently bad.  I don't think the virus was planned.</p>
<p>I do think the virus is overblown and lockdowns are - at best - very misguided, if not outright unnecessary.  I do think masks probably have some positive impact but the degree of that is questionable.  I do think <em>forcing</em> people to take vaccines is bad; though <em>encouraging</em> it isn't.  I don't think the oligarchs planned this, but, being as wealthy and powerful as they are, they can turn virtually any situation into a net positive for them.</p>
