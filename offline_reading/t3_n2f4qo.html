        <p>I noticed this comment there:</p>
<p>"I am so sorry for the loss of your beloved mother. I had my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine recently and I absolutely detest anti-vaxxers and their willful head-in-the-sand ignorance. Even if I had suffered a horrible reaction and knew worse was yet to come (I had a sore arm and a headache for a little while) I would still be jumping to get the second dose of my vaccine. Vaccinations are so, so important. Especially in the face of something as vastly dangerous and terrible as covid.</p>
<p>Your mother sounds like she was a wonderful woman. She clearly raised a level-headed and intelligent daughter who obviously loved her very much, so she must have done a few things right. :) My heart hurts for your grief, and at the same time I am glad you can honor her memory by not lashing out in pain at the potential cause of her untimely death. It is absolutely a tragedy, and yet you are right: the benefit of vaccination outweighs the risk of (very rare) adverse effects, even when they happen at great personal cost. Because covid is objectively worse in terms of overall damage, and we cannot afford to let it run through us unchecked. Science is not perfect, but it is the best defense we have... And sometimes terrible things just happen to good people regardless of our very best intentions.</p>
<p>I wish you peace and healing, however you may find it. Thank you for sharing your mom's story. I hope people will take your message to heart."</p>
<p>I'm dumbfounded by this comment. How sheepish can you be? Covid is not that dangerous, at least not as much as the media likes to claim. Why risk a horrible reaction or death with an inability to sue the manufacturers for something that literally has a 99.7% survival rate? The person's mother would almost certainly be better off taking her chances against Covid.</p>

        <p>Here's another one to highlight</p>
<p>"I'm so sorry for your loss. About four years ago, I suffered blood clots from a birth control injection. The very rare form of stroke found in the same young women you spoke of: CVST (cerebral venous sinus thrombosis).</p>
<p>I wanted to let you know that I am sorry for your loss, but I am fully on your side. Yes, there are risks for medical issues and issues after a vaccination or injection of the sorts. Yes, it is easy to think it's too scary.</p>
<p>I almost died four years ago. I was hours away from having to go on an operating table from the swelling of my brain, and was told I wouldn't make it through the night. I'm incredibly lucky, and not many can say that.</p>
<p>I would go through it again for the high chance that it ensures myself, my family, and even those who could come in contact with me would be safe.</p>
<p>CVST, or the blood clotting issues that have formed from the vaccines, are extremely unfortunate. Not just unfortunate for you, but unfair. I'm so incredibly sorry for your loss and what happened to her.</p>
<p>On a side note, and I'm unsure if this will give you any comfort; when I was in the hospital with my stroke, I don't remember any pain. During the stroke, I only remember the known symptoms of a stroke before going unconscious. I was in the hospital for several days. I was in and out of consciousness on the third day.</p>
<p>I didn't feel any pain, and I am hopeful that your mother did not either. And though she was declared to be gone two days ago, I know she will always be with you. She sounds like an amazing woman, and I'm proud of you for standing up against the people who are using her, and others, as an excuse to avoid vaccinations.</p>
<p>Get your damn vaccines. If you're worried about dying, think about the others could could pass death on to if you're unvaccinated and spreading a virus."</p>
<p>How about no? Risking my own life for other people's health is not my responsibility, nor should it be.</p>

        <p>Almost died from a stroke from an unnessecary birth control injection, yet would do it again and have a high possibility of dying just because she wouldn't close her legs. </p>
<p>Genuinely mind boggling, you'd think this would be an epiphany moment to change your mind but  reinforces and you'd rather virtue signal injections instead. Don't worry if you have a stroke too, she will send you a comforting message on Reddit and say "you did the right thing, we're in the same boat now gurl."</p>

        <p>I don’t think a lot of Reddit is real. A lot of young developing minds spend hours on here. We already know about team Halo being paid by the WHO to make sick tiktoks about how fucking rad MRNA vaccines are. I think it’s safe to assume 90% of the bullshit on here is bots or paid puppets. Big pharma has the deepest pockets and the most evil intent, I’m starting to think big pharma is enemy #1, over big tech.</p>

        <p>you know what? no, she's not an idiot, if she's telling the truth. </p>
<p>she's a grieving woman trying to make sense of a terrible loss in her life. she's not being rational but who would be? </p>
<p>there's a way of dealing with shame and denial, where people repress everything but their brains keep trying to resolve the issue anyway. so it comes out in weird ways like projection or control issues. maybe by pushing the vaccine she's trying to resolve the contradiction and guilt of "i thought it was safe and it killed my mom". She's maybe feeling guilty about promoting the vaccine, or believing it was safe, so she's trying to do that again to get a different outcome this time.</p>

        <p>I heard a commercial on the radio today that said (exactly this:)“all of the adverse reactions you hear about probably won’t happen to you”. In my head I’m thinking “if you got a surgery done and the doctor said you ‘probably won’t die’, that would not be good enough for me”.  I think a lot of us don’t want the vaccine because for one, it’s so new that we don’t know the long term effects. Hell even the covid virus has been around longer and we know it’s not as bad as it was hyped to be.  Second, with the vaccine being constantly marketed to everyone, something just feels off; like we’re the test subjects.</p>

<p>"My condolences. There could be several reasons why anyone would have a severe adverse reaction to a vaccine but nope, nope, nope anti-vaxxers just do not listen. I am sure it was like this as well when the polio vaccine first came out and many thought that was evil or against God. History is just repeating itself like it always does. Again, my condolences.

        <p>I'm starting to think this is the only way people can get the word out. Think about it. If you post "my mom died from getting the vaccine, dont get the vaccine", you'd be called a science denier, banned, and your post would be deleted so no one would ever see it. </p>
<p>Maybe adding the "still get the vaccine" at the end of these posts is the only way they can get the word out without being censored and they're just hoping people will think for themselves and not get the vaccine if they read enough of these posts.</p>
<p>The situation reminds me of the "Brutus is an honorable man" speech from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.</p>

        <p>Anybody remember that movie Kung Pow? The masters trained this one idiot to fight wrong, as a joke. He would say, "Try my 'face on your fist' technique!" and other dumb shit, and get his ass kicked. It was funny though. But it belongs in movies. This is just pathetic. These morons are willing to die for the "huge benefit" of being vaccinated against a virus that claims mostly just old, sick, or obese people, when the vaccine can apparently take young, healthy, and fit people. If I gouged out my eyes I'd still be able to see better than these fools.</p>

        <p>They're not saying report it in that sense.  If it's logged in the VAERS database, it MIGHT eventually wake some people up when they see the recorded incidents are 100's x more than any past vaccines.</p>
