    <strong>The superintendent of my kid’s school district is recommending “100% virtual learning” for at least the first nine weeks of the school year.</strong>
    <p><p>I’m so pissed. My son will be in first grade. The superintendent referenced “rising case numbers” in her email to parents and stressed “prioritizing health and safety.” When really it feels like appeasing the doomer crowd. How am I supposed to plan for this? It all really just feels like a slap in the face to working parents and teachers who want to send kids back to school. Will I have to pay for full time daycare now? Quit my job? Hire a tutor? What about my other job as a substitute bus driver? If there’s no school, there’s no work for me. It seems like they’re preparing for another shutdown of “non-essential” businesses in the fall, which I definitely won’t be able to handle.</p>
<p>I’m just so angry. Why in the hell can’t people who are scared or at risk stay home and let the rest of us live.</p></p>

        <p>Funny enough, at least 50% of teachers surveyed said they feel comfortable returning. The district even offered “alternate day” schooling as an option. 60% of parents want to send students back. So I don’t understand why our superintendent came to this decision.</p>

        <p>My wife is a teacher. She just wants to get back into her classroom and teach. We are in much the same place as you, with a child going into 1st grade. There’s a chance my wife will be out of work and my daughter will be heartbroken at not being able to attend school.</p>

        <p>I 100% agree this is on the teachers and the teachers union. Screwing over our children so teachers can sit on their assess at home and get paid to not teach. It’s disgusting really.</p>

        <p>&rt;My son will be in first grade</p>
<p>So, your son is 6 or 7? Is virtual learning even effective for a child that young?</p>
<p>My niece is 9 and virtual learning was an absolute nightmare with her. We were already having some fights with her about homework, but her grades were great and she sincerely enjoyed school. Virtual learning was a flop because she cannot just sit there for an hour or two to complete assignments, and we are not teachers. She's also old enough to know that the whole thing is nonsense (her class had a virtual field trip to Disney World; do they really think these kids are stupid?).</p>
<p>I'm sincerely worried if her school reopens because she misses it so much, but I know she'll feel miserable if she returns with the restrictions that will likely be in place. And that's if they reopen five days a week.</p>

        <p>Yea he’s six and I could understand letting the kids go back with restrictions. Why can’t we phase opening with schools like we do with everything else? Which is why I feel like they’re setting us up for another shutdown in the fall. I sure hope not cause I will f*cking riot.</p>

        <p>You are right to be pissed. Ireland sent kids back to school sans mask and did a study that found <a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.21.2000903">No evidence of secondary transmission of COVID-19 from children attending school in Ireland, 2020</a>.</p>
<p>The people aren't just depriving our kids of a childhood, they're making them pay for expense of the deprivation with the unsustainable ballooning public debt. It's horseshit.</p>
