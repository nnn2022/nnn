        <p>“I have a history of having an over-reactive vagal response, and so with that if I have pain from anything—hangnail or if I stub my toe — I can just pass out,”</p>
<p>She passes out with a stubbed toe?</p>

        <p>If this happens to her all the time, why didn't she instantly recognise what was going on with her?  Why didn't she ask for help?  Why did she agree to go on stage in front of cameras and not chill out somewhere until she was sure she would be OK? I don't buy any of this.</p>

        <p>I actually have the condition she’s talking about.
Vasovegal syncope.</p>
<p>Or Fainting can be very confusing and frightening, sometimes you don’t even realize what is happening.</p>
<p>Mine is often triggered by being in a room with needles, I’ve fainted about a dozen times and about half of those were getting my blood drawn.</p>
<p>The first time i fainted it was because I had a loose tooth, other times I’ve fainted due to just thinking about pain, she said it <em>can</em> happen due to pain, but not that it always does. For me it’s pretty random but almost always is related to pain.</p>
<p>I still consider it possible she’s lying, but there isn’t anything ridiculous about what she’s claiming based on my experience with this exact condition, she just happened to faint at the worst possible time... I mean the pressure of being on camera could have caused her to faint, especially if she has strong feelings about lockdowns. I don’t see why they wouldn’t just use placebo/saline for these video shoots though.</p>
<p>Im very anti lockdowns FWIW.</p>

        <p>I don't have a hard time believing someone could have a fear of needles and pass out from getting one. </p>
<p>I do have a hard time believing someone who supposedly has a history of passing out from a hangnail would be the one getting a vaccine people are already skeptical about on television.</p>

        <p>That aspect does seem a bit odd. I've been scared of needles since being in hospital after surgery and having had no say in nurses constantly coming to do blood tests, and have fainted during a blood test once since then, but that's, um, part of why I don't want the vaccine.</p>
<p>I'm not sure the vaccine itself would've caused it within such a relatively short period though, so perhaps she just exaggerated how often she faints a little and it genuinely hadn't occurred to her getting the vaccine could trigger a faint. For me it was just the one time, after all, and it's not something I expect or worry about with blood tests, I just don't like being poked with needles.</p>
