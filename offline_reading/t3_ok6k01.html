    <strong>Hypocrites</strong>
    <p><p>Posted the majority of this in another thread on here, but I want to remind everyone..</p>
<p>These fucks were the same people walking around and spreading the flu, cold, mono, strep etc. not too long ago, coming into work sick, working out sick, doing groceries and going out in public living their lives, NOT washing their hands nor hand-sanitizing while sick. Bonus points if they blew their nose before shaking your hand or coughed/sneezed openly/incorrectly.</p>
<p>Remember that shit? Where was the fucking finger-pointing then??? People still die from the flu and will continue to do so, IT'S A PART OF LIFE</p>
<p>Furthermore,</p>
<p>NO ONE SEEMED TO GIVE A FUCK ABOUT OTHERS' HEALTH THEN</p>
<p>NO ONE DEMANDED LOCKDOWNS, SOCIAL DISTANCING, MASKS, OR VACCINE PASSPORTS THEN</p>
<p>NO ONE ASKED EVERYONE THEY KNEW IF THEY HAD GOTTEN THEIR FLU SHOT TO PROTECT FROM THE FLU THEN</p>
<p>NO ONE LIVED IN FEAR THEN</p>
<p>And NOW you call US "murderers"? That you couldn't care if the unvaccinated die? WHEN YOU HAVE THE SAME GODDAMN ABILITY TO SPREAD IT? As if you didn't WEREN'T killing grandma and people with comorbidities with the latest flu strain you caught in 2019 as well? Motherfucking vain virtue-signalling hypocrites forgot how to think critically, they value perceived safety and self-image over the freedom of choice and ABILITY to consent. What happened to "my body my choice"? WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU NOW?</p>
<p>No long-term studies. No actual information on the vaccine itself. Only lies, fear porn, outright government hypocrisy IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE, social media and $68 trillion swept right under your feet. There is no human decency anymore if you can't respect other people's ability to make a DECISION for THEMSELVES and CONSENT. That is what we have HISTORICALLY FOUGHT FOR THE ABILITY TO DO. WHY ARE YOU WILLINGLY UNDOING IT?</p>
<p>It's like there's been a literal on and off switch between 2019 and 2020. "A minute of hate" if you will. All these conditions existed BEFORE the news talked about it. And people weren't fear-mongering then. People weren't turning against co-workers, friends, and families then. People were willing to have a conversation and reason WITH others then.</p>
<p>PEOPLE WEREN'T PASSIVELY WISHING DEATH UPON PEOPLE FOR MAKING DIFFERENT DECISIONS THAN THEIRS THEN </p>
<p>HOW MANY MORE RESTRICTIONS WILL IT TAKE FOR YOU TO REALIZE THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT DOES NOT WANT TO RETURN TO NORMAL?</p>
<p>Fucking PATHETIC</p></p>

        <p>&rt;People still die from the flu and will continue to do so, IT'S A PART OF LIFE</p>
<p>Akshully, this has been deboonked in a FACT CHECK! The flu disappeared since covid appeared. 99% of it *poof* gone just like that.</p>
<p>&rt;That is what we have HISTORICALLY FOUGHT FOR THE ABILITY TO DO. WHY ARE YOU WILLINGLY UNDOING IT?</p>
<p>I will add that this is happening because:</p>
<ol>
<li>People are idiots</li>
<li>People don't know their history</li>
</ol>
<p>And it's so fucking sad.</p>
