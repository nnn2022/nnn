    <strong>Was just banned from CovidVaccinated</strong>
    <p><p>i've been frequenting that sub the last few days out of genuine interest.</p>
<p>someone <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/kqxy0s/vaccine_doubts/">posted a question</a> (not sure if anyone else can see the permalink) about doubts on safety, to which somebody else replied that "it" has been "well tested and studied".</p>
<p>i typed out the reply below, and was banned the second i clicked post. as soon as the page reloaded i had the notification.</p>
<p>i was very careful not to say anything that could be construed as "anti-vax" as i expected to be banned for that, and i am not "anti-vax" in general anyway.</p>
<p>i only wanted to put across what is, to me, a logical assessment of the risks on both sides of the covid vaccine, with particular emphasis on Pfizer.</p>
<p>i've read elsewhere that it's modded by bots, not sure if this is confirming that. seems like every negative comment is quickly downvoted or removed (looks like my comment is actually removed to others too, yet i can see it on my account). i guess something in my post flagged the autoban. which is weird because i only linked mainstream sites and nothing weird.</p>
<p>anyway thought i would share</p>
<p>&rt;saying it has been "well tested and studied" is very misleading. that doesn't mean i'm saying it's dangerous though.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;the virus has been identified for less than a year, and it usually takes up to 10 years or more for a traditional vaccine to be made, HOWEVER, a lot of the covid19 vaccines are using mRNA which has enabled quicker development.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;this kind of treatment has never been applied on a large scale for a virus like this before.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Pfizer, to mention one manufacturer, is the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.nl/pharmaceutical-company-reputation-rankings-2018-6?international=true&amp;r=US">least trusted</a> and most criminally charged (examples <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pfizer-lawsuit-idUSKCN10D1D8">1</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pfizer-settlement-sb-idUSTRE5813XB20090903">2</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pfizer-settlement-idUSBRE8760WM20120807">3</a>) pharmaceutical company in the world, and have, in many countries, been given <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-pfizer-vaccine-legal-indemnity-safety-ministers-b1765124.html">immunity from prosecution</a> from any harmful side effects.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;for me, taking a vaccine from that company in particular is like inviting a convicted sex offender to babysit your kids.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;bearing this in mind, the rates of hospitalisation for those under 65, and the fact that the vaccine has already been stated to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-9018547/Pfizer-CEO-not-certain-covid-shot-prevents-transmission.html">not reliably prevent spread</a>, the case for young and/or healthy people taking it is quite weak in a lot of people's opinion.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;not saying something one way or the other, but it's important to get a full picture of what's going on. like all things, it's important to weigh up the risk and decide for yourself if it's worth it.</p>

        <p>The only time the sheep show any courage is when they are confronted with someone questioning what they blindly believe. Facts, logic or any differing opinion immediately triggers a fit of rage. Sadly several generations of parents have let their children be conditioned by the public school system to look at the government as their loving mother and savior. Other than the short time that it took to develop the vaccine the blanket immunity given to the drug manufacturers is a serious red flag. What if something goes wrong with several batches and people become seriously ill or die, oh well we have immunity.</p>

        <p>very spooky and reminiscent of the fyre fest debacle. i rewatched that documentary recently with vaccination questions fresh in my mind-what happened with reasonable questions on social media regarding housing and where the festival was actually being held? they were ALL deleted or generic/canned non answers or outright lies. I think the fact that Pfizer and Moderna have immunity from any sort of harmful side effects is a strong indictment. If something is strongly encouraged for me to take, but there is little recourse for potential harmful effects of the thing, how does that not rouse some strong suspicion? this isn't a music fest or a badly developed video game, this is about the body, the very thing you live in everyday whether you like it or not!</p>

        <p>Just got this message from the mods regarding my ban</p>
<p>&rt;CovidVaccinated has experienced significant issues with brigading by members of /conspiracy and other sub-reddits devoted to COVID-19 conspiracies. In order to protect the users of our subreddit from harassment as well as bad faith posts, /CovidVaccinated is issuing automatic bans to users with post history on these subreddits. This is a direct response to multiple violations of Reddit Content Policy Rule 2 by members of these other subreddits.</p>

        <p>i think if you post in this sub, conspiracy, and probably many others, you are flagged and instabanned if you attempt to post anything in covidvaccinated</p>
<p>apparently it's because of Rule 2, which basically says if you don't agree with the general meaning of the sub you can be banned for being disruptive to the sub community</p>
