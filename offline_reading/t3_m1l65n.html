        <p>The majority of Christians are in the dark to what’s going on.  All the churches have been infiltrated by the enemy. Just look at all the televangelists. Any church that supports Israel is in on it. Millions of Christians will take the vaccine and the mark.</p>

<p>Are you Christian by chance? I’m not but I know some who are super against all of this. One of my good friends is a very devout Christian and he’s convinced it’s the mark of the beast. He tries to convert me a lot but I really don’t mind because I know he’s doing it out of the goodness of his heart because he thinks it will help me.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to hear your perspective if you’re involved in the community. If you feel like sharing of course</p>

        <p>I’m Christian, I was raised Catholic, I was atheist up until I was like 26? Then I got super into philosophy and Buddhism. I was Buddhist for about a year then I read the Bible after watching a BBC special that claimed Jesus went to India to study in his lost years from puberty until he started preaching at 33. I read my Bible through and through for the first time after that and everything clicked. Found a church and started studying. The mark will come later. Trump was doing some deals with Israel that are signs as to what’s coming. The third temple will be built, they wanted to sacrifice animals like before. All the wars in the Middle East, for oil, are wars of conquest. Look up the Greater Israel Project. They want all that land. The AntiChrist will claim to be from the line of David, but will be from Israel. The New World Order, will be a one world totalitarian communist government, with Israel leading the way. After World War 3, they will be the only “functioning democracy” left standing. They’ll look at the world and say “see, this is the mess you got yourselves into. You need a leader” they’ll be the Messiah. They reject Christ as the Messiah. Covid is paving the way. Cashless society, digital IDs, tracing software, cameras that recognize if you’re social distancing or not, if you’re gathering in large groups, I.e, protesting your oppressive government. There needs to be one big cataclysm next before the mark. World war 3, or Project Blue Beam. The world will be going to hell and aliens will come and show up as saviors. Those aliens are demons tho, from another dimension. There’s already talk of the Great Reset. THEN you will have to take the mark, to be given UBI, to have a job, to buy, sell, to be able to participate in society. People will be desperate for it, the vast majority of the population will be dead by then. You will be under constant surveillance from the government, social media, your phone, your tv. Everyone will be herded into the cities. All the good land is for the elites and they want to Keep easy surveillance on their slaves. Any little mishap, the slightest criticism of them, of the great leader who brought peace to the world (AntiChrist), any wrongthink (cancel culture), and your chip is turned off. You can’t get your groceries, you can’t pay your rent, you can’t post online. And just like 1984, you are erased, you never existed. They’ll come for you when no ones watching 
What happened to Joe? 
Who? 
You know Joe?
Shut up! They’ll get you next. 
You’ll be an unperson</p>

        <p>The consensus seems to be the Covid vaccine alters your DNA, you will no longer be a child of god, but a hybrid like the Nephilim or giants that were created when the fallen angels mated with human women. You are barred from entering Heaven and are the same as the demons or fallen angels. Taking the covid vaccine is a sure bet you’ll take the mark</p>

        <p>I think that's a bit far. God will not allow his children to be infected by a vaccine in such a way. I agree if you're dumb enough to fall for the lies you might be dumb enough to fall for other stuff but let's not got lost in fear. If you have to take a vaccine to go to work or church just take it. If the mark of the beast comes in our lifetime, cross that bridge when you come to it.</p>

        <p>My church closed before they legally had to. They've fallen for the lies. Even when it's been legal to re-open, they've refused, because it's "not a good look". I'm disgusted by it and only a very small handful of the Christians I know are asking any questions. Even one guy I know, despite being skeptical about lockdowns, has already had his vaccine.</p>

        <p>Damn that was interesting to read, I'm an atheist but I do think it's plausible that if gods, angels and demons did exist, they could be just aliens. People from the past didn't have a concept of the universe and technology, if they see some being coming down from the sky their only explanation is that it was a god or angel. If he did something unexplainable like cure someone or split the sea with an alien tech? for them it was magic and miracles.</p>

        <p>Have you heard of a man named Albert Pike by any chance?</p>
<p>He is best known for being an officer in the Civil War on the side of the Confederacy. But he was also a 33rd degree Freemason who was extensively learned in history and religion, and supposedly dabbled in esoteric and occult practices.</p>
<p>The part relevant to this discussion, is that he accurately predicted the specific circumstances and outcomes of the First and Second world wars, multiple decades before they actually happened. He then predicted a Third world war between Zionists and Islamists that would supposedly lead to the destruction of both, as well as exhausting most resources of the other nations around the world. </p>
<p>The resulting upheaval would lead to a significant social revolution that would supposedly eliminate both atheist materialist thought, and Christian spiritual thought.</p>
<p>Not sure if that is what you were referencing, some of it parallels, other parts contradict, what you said. But it's interesting speculation nonetheless.</p>

        <p>The shot isn’t the mark. They’re still talking about digital currencies and wallets, social credit scores like China, covid passports, they’re testing the chips already in lots of countries. There’s a video on YouTube some guy gets the chip and uses it to get something from a vending machine. I’m still not sure what the purpose of the vaccines is, test compliance? There could be severe side effects that we’ll see in the coming months. Maybe kill off a good portion of the population, who knows.</p>

        <p>The vaccination record is the mark. There's a reason the message now is "get any vaccine, immediately". The idea is to create confusion <em>eventually</em>.. "I got the J&amp;J, well I got the first dose of Moderna and then the J&amp;J... Does that cover the new variants?? Did you hear that AstraZeneca covers those??" etc etc</p>
<p>That confusion as to who has taken what, and how efficient that particular batch was, is what will lead to these records being necessary. And people will accept.</p>
<p>Look at it this way - restrictions are relaxing because people are en masse taking the vaccine. These are the people who <em>were always going to</em>.</p>
<p>Fast forward to May. We're at 35% vaccinated. Insert new variant that is stronger and more transmittable. Shut down businesses, blame people who didn't get initial vaccines. People who otherwise wouldn't have taken vaccine now get latest vaccine to re open business, further encouraging others who are resistant to do the same.</p>
<p>Repeat as necessary until you have a majority willing to accept whatever insane measures are proposed to "resume normal".</p>
<p>It will turn into a "if you can't beat them, join them" for most people eventually, with <em>maybe</em> 5% of the population actually staying true and holding out. Hopefully the rapture happens before then.</p>

        <p>It isn’t a vaccine, it just lessens the symptoms of you contract the virus... in other words, a treatment. So the purpose is $$$. </p>
<p>If we’re going to take Revelation literally then there is a lot of stuff that needs to happen before the actual end times.</p>
<p>I’m not getting the “vaccine” but I would definitely be more worried about microchips and digital “currency”.</p>

        <p>to those of you who are Christians, or who are entertaining Christian views in some capacity, you should be aware, there is language that suggests <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/k5x9or/we_are_about_to_witness_the_largest_propaganda/gehw00c/?context=3">the true mark may not even be a physical marking on your body at all</a>, and may instead be something more generic that signifies allegiance to the system. I don't know the truth of these things, and neither do you, but please investigate Jesus and look into the Gospels to see what he says. Might sound extreme right now, but I'm telling you the truth, we're not going to escape this shit without knowing Jesus, no matter how intently we try to pay attention. I tried paying attention before I knew Jesus. I paid a whole lot of attention. It led straight to the enemy.</p>

        <p>The vaccine passport probably and most likely isn't the "mark" but it's kind of a case of boiling the frog. It's definitely in the ballpark of that concept, it's the boiling of the frog, flirting dangerously close with dystopia and the concept of the mark. Basically, it might not be the mark, but it's opening the door to progress into that territory, for sure.</p>

        <p>I'm mostly with you, but my point is: you have to admit that it's playing with fire, the whole vaccine passport thing. Even if it's not the mark itself, it's still a completely dystopian precedent, and opens the doors for all sorts of other tyrannies and evils, including the eventual coming of the mark. Like the guy below me said: it's not a wise thing to do. So sure, taking the vaccine for the purpose of the passport probably won't condemn you, but it's just not wise in my view. It's playing along with those playing with fire. At some point you have to take a stand. This is where I'm taking mine.</p>
<p>(edit: the irony is that I'd even be open to the vaccine if they weren't trying to make it mandatory and after it was out of the experimental stage, but them trying to make it mandatory is what instantly sets off my "bullshit detector" and renders it a conspiracy in my eyes)</p>

        <p>Yeah I’m with you too. The way I look at it, the apocalypse is inevitable and will result in a good thing. If the dominos are already falling, you can fight it, run from it, but as Thanos said “destiny arrives just the same.” Only thing that matters is making sure we are right with God and make the right choices when the the important decisions come around.</p>

        <p>You do know that the Bible doesn't say that, right? The Bible only says that the false prophet is the one who'd mandate that all people receive the mark under penalty of death. That doesn't mean that the mark cannot exist without either the beast or the false prophet. </p>
<p>Whatever you ultimately believe, a Christian who reads the Bible and believes what it says should never take anything in their body that's associated with the ability to make transactions and I thought that the UK's minister's Freudian slip would have settled the matter.</p>

        <p>This is what the Bible says: </p>
<p>15 And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.</p>
<p>16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:</p>
<p>17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</p>
<p>18 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.</p>

<p>Gosh, no idea who DVed you to oblivion, but I certainly didn't do that to a fellow believer. We may disagree, but I won't DV you.</p>
<p>It says that he will cause you to receive it, not he will 'create it and cause you to receive it.' The mark will be there beforehand, and only the false prophet will force people to receive it.</p>
<p>This is my theory: There's no standardised way to determine who got jabbed and documents and apps can be forged/hacked. The solution would be to implement on-person vax ID like this:  <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-55548670">Covid: Swansea Uni develops 'world's first' vaccine smart patch - BBC News</a> which we already know is a repackaged version of this  <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2019/storing-vaccine-history-skin-1218">Storing medical information below the skin’s surface | MIT News | Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>.</p>

        <p>Im not exactly saying it’s the mark or not - what I’m saying is it’s weird how you get the entire world to take something they don’t know what will do to them with the idea of “at least it will allow me to live “normally”.”</p>

        <p>I believe when the time for the mark comes, it will be very obvious to all what is happening. The third temple needs to be rebuilt first, a seven year treaty with Israel, broken halfway through. The Antichrist will desecrate the temple and set up his image. And that’s when the mark will be required.</p>
<p>But yeah, you can see how easy it is to get the mob to comply. A lot of people will go along with it. Imagine seeing all the die hard atheists deciding to worship a man as their god.</p>

        <p>Not if you’ve actually read endtimes prophecy and have more then a general knowledge. Then you know this isnt the mark of the beast. It might be a precursor, it might set precedent and be a trial run, but getting the vaccine will not cost you your immortal soul like the mark will.</p>

        <p>The bible says the mark is put either on the hand or the forehead. To me that seems to be a fairly simple metaphor for the mark being something intangible, like a lie or a perversion, that the sinners either truly believe in(in the forehead) or simply go through the motions of(on the hand).</p>
<p>Given that revelation is a transcription of John the Baptist's dream, it seems fair to interpret things a little metaphorically. For example, a beast with seven heads might be an organization that sits on seven hills. For a random possibility.</p>

        <p>I have begun to think of the mark of the beast in a more literal sense of the word beast. We are being treated like beasts or animals. Dirty, must be muzzled, must get our shots, in order to be able to move about. We are being treated much more like cattle than human beings currently.</p>
