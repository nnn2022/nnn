    <strong>Science behind "my mask protects you, your mask protects me"</strong>
    <p><p>Serious question. Can someone please explain this idea (with references preferably)? It just doesn't make any sense to me that a mask DOESN'T protect the wearer at all, and that it only protects others.</p></p>

        <p>Hospital healthcare provider here: masks are intended to protect both parties... which is why it's so infuriating that this myth keeps getting spread around. I literally cannot believe the shit that has come out of the mouths of Anthony Fauci and Theresa Tam. First they blatantly lie to the public with the advice that no one should wear masks, then this second lie.</p>
<p>Anyone with a 1/4 of a brain who isn't a healthcare provider should have easily questioned why healthy nurses and doctors are donning masks in the presence of COVID infected patients.</p>

        <p>Think about how that mask is fit and it’s construction...sure it may marginally help, but it’s not a respirator.</p>

        <p>Air filtration occurs in both directions. Thats why hospital workers wear them for seeing infectious patient for decades, for TB etc</p>

        <p>Okay, so then wouldn't it be a medical modality for the wearer? They don't put them on patients. So it protects hospital staff, right? Wouldn't that disprove "my mask protects you?"</p>

        <p>because viruses are every where, if you are shedding virus its on your skin, on your clothes ,hair . everywhere. Whether a mask catches some virus particles is moot. EVERYTHING is contaminated. Masks will certainly catch something but most people have poorly fitted substandard junk. The mask itself will catch virus and then be contaminated and so shouldn't be reused but how many people do that. The thing that was supposed to protect you now has virus on it and when you touch it the mask infects you. Every thing you pass by could possibly now be infected from dust shedding from your clothes and skin whether or not you breathed on it. There is no realistic way to safe guard from a virus especially if you believe any of the scare stories about how long they might survive or travel. In any group of people the virus will travel so far that it will be basically impossible to say who passed on the virus. So masks will definitely help a little but its just not enough, either its a REAL quarantine or life may as well continue as normal. </p>

<p>this study is interesting for health care facilities, does it talk about masks? well they are mentioned TWICE. there is a lot that required to be done and masks are not the be all and end all. There is a real reason why WHO said that masks and lock downs dont work.</p>
