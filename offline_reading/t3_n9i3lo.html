        <p>People have been taking video of empty hospitals for over a year now. Some of them get arrested. In Brazil, some politicians who oppose the Covid-19 restrictions did it themselves.</p>
<p>All over the world we're being lied to because a financial collapse is coming and the shutdowns are how governments are preparing for it.</p>
<p>Forced business closure and experiments with UBI allow them to test their plans to paper their way through it as the global debt crisis unfolds.</p>
<p>The virus is a distraction to bring on fear, so trillions upon trillions can be printed with no one asking questions.</p>
<p>It also gets people used to being locked down, which is how they'll deal with mass protests when it finally unwinds.  Declare a virus, order everyone indoors, and arrest anyone who disobeys.</p>
<p>People are so gullible when scared they can even order people to police their own neighborhoods and they'll do it.</p>
<p>Global governments are cooperating with each other for their own benefit and tangentially for ours. Remember, when this thing hits  it will be unprecedented instability and supply chain interruptions that could leave millions starving. Total and complete unrest. World war.</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>
<p>Nothing is about Covid-19. It's all about preparing for a financial collapse and global capitulation. A restart of the financial system, and authoritarian control over society is their chosen way to maintain order when it happens.</p>
<p>Did you notice the timing? Flu season happens to be when financial markets fail, historically. September, October, etc. The timing is perfect.</p>
<p>Sometime between this coming Sept/Oct and definitely within a decade from now --- this bubble will burst, and when it does it will be a period of time unlike we've ever lived through.</p>
<p>It will make this miserable 2020 seem like good times... And all we can do is cross our fingers that the powers that be take action to maintain stability for themselves in a way that benefits them.</p>
<p>But anything is possible. Again, we are facing conditions that could lead to World War 3. They know this, and are cooperating. That's why this thing is global. No one in power wants that kind of war.</p>
<p>Protests will erupt as soon as people go hungry and realize the financial collapse is due to a small number of people exploiting workers all these years for their own benefit.  That is why we are being divided in every way possible. Race, economics, Covid-19, etc.</p>
<p>They can't afford for us to unite all at once and hold them accountable for what they have done and what they are doing... So they keep us divided and scared.</p>
<p>Fear short circuits logic and reason, and division separates us from having the only kind of power that can threaten concentrated wealth.</p>
