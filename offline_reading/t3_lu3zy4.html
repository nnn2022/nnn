    <strong>Good News: Eric Peters' Neighbor Takes Off Her Face Diaper!</strong>

<p>Since this psyop began almost a year ago, Eric Peters has been a leading opponent of the death cult. There's some good news in his latest Diaper Report:</p>
<p><strong>Diaper Report 2/27/21</strong></p>
<p>By eric -February 27, 202121596</p>
<p>After days of clouds and rain, the sight of a little sunshine is restorative. Affirmation that it will stop raining, eventually. That the gloom is not forever.</p>
<p>I thought I’d share some cloud-parting sunshine with you from the front lines of the war against weaponized hypochondria.</p>
<p>The phone range and I picked it up. My nice neighbor lady was on the line. Her voice was up tempo as she related how she had shed the Face Diaper she is sick of wearing and won’t anymore. Even for the sake of her friend, who is riddled with fear of sickness and threatened to refuse to visit with her or shop with her unless she put the loathsome, degrading vestment on.</p>
<p>My neighbor lady told me she told this friend she would love to see her and go shopping with her and that she is welcome to wear her “mask” – as these things are styled – if she wishes to but that she will not and that’s it. If it makes her uncomfortable, she will have to deal with it. The friend backed down and the two went shopping – and dining – without my friend even going-through-the-motions of feigning agreement with sickness psychosis as by perfunctorily and partially putting the vestment on to enter a restaurant before taking it off at the table – a species of kabuki so ridiculous that the general willingness to perform it speaks volumes about the beaten-down spirits of those who perform it.</p>
<p>She could barely contain her enthusiasm as she told me how good it felt to not have that muzzle over her face. To feel like a human being rather than made to feel like a leper. I have heard the same story from several others who’ve shed the vestment, having reached the end of their willingness to be shamed into the wearing of it. Uniformly, they describe the weight lifted; the sense of oppressiveness vitiated and – most of all – that they feel normal again.</p>
<p>My neighbor friend is a woman in her early 70s – exactly the profile most easily shamed and pressured into wearing the vestment, being physically among the least able to back down a religious bully. My friend wore the vestment for awhile for this reason and also because she wanted to see people – even if she could not see their faces. Like many older people, she is retired (and also a widow) and sickness psychosis has deprived these people of social contact to such a degree that serious depression has become a far greater threat to their lives than “the virus.”</p></p>
