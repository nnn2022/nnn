    <strong>Does anyone else have family members pressuring them to get the vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>Why aren't they just happy that they are vaxxed? Why do they have to push it on everyone else?</p>
<p>They say I am putting them in danger. Mother fucker if the vaccines work like you say you will be fine!!!.</p>
<p>I am sick of this push to demonize anyone who is even hesitant to get the vaxx.</p>
<p>I am usually a passive person but I am going to have to tell my family to stop the shit soon. </p>
<p>It's not even about the science. </p>
<p>It's the idea that good people get the vaccine and bad people don't. It's us vs them. </p>
<p>They are just so full of the shit the media and government has been pumping into them they can't see it.</p></p>

        <p>I’m on the fence about getting the vaccine for various reasons, and my family are quite concerned about it. I keep telling them that I don’t get the flu jab and that’s one of the reasons I’m not sure I want this one, but I think the media has scared them into thinking it’s a big mistake.</p>
<p>I also work with people every day and the most common point being made is that we all need to get it to protect others, and I’m like.. that’s not how it works at all. The vaccine is (in theory) to protect you the individual. It doesn’t stop you getting COVID or passing it onto others.</p>
<p>As you said it’s becoming very ‘us and them’ and I really hate where this is headed</p>

        <p>It’s an opportunity to practice compassion. Do not argue, stand in your truth with confidence and happiness. Change the subject when it’s brought up, bring up stories “light hearted subjects” bring them back to the present moment. Lead by example by being true to yourself and also respect them for being true to themselves. </p>
<p>You can start by saying them pressuring you is making you feel uncomfortable- let’s talk about something else. If they continue you can say, it seems you might need to take some space from me, as I seem to be a trigger for you, maybe you need to take some space from me? </p>

        <p>My parents are both vaxxed. I've recently been admitting to  more conservative/right leaning sentiments than my lefty parents are used to. They've kinda started questioning me on everything now.<br>
My vaxx invitation letter arrived a few days ago and I only opened it to see if it said literally anything about how to tell them I'm not getting vaxxed not to bother sending repeat invites. I left the letter on my desk and my parents asked if i made an appointment yet. <br>
They were not too bad about it but they were kinda baffled when i said i'm not planning on responding to it anytime soon.</p>

        <p>Completely agree with you OP! I have 2 sisters. One is like-minded like us, and the other is a hard core Vaxx pusher. She and her SO had been so vocal how stupid my like minded sister and I are and how selfish we are for not vaccinating and that we are putting our kids in danger, blah blah blah... After she had my niece (vaxx-pusher), she informed us that she would be getting all of her baby shots and that she'd love for my son and our other sister's daughter to meet their new cousin. We told her that is fine, but that we would feel safer waiting until baby girl's vaccines were done shedding, to protect our kids. The look on her face. 💁🏽‍♀️🤣</p>
