    <strong>This subreddit has a lot of potential to bring attention to the new normal but not without credibility (unpopular opinion)</strong>
    <p><p>The new normal, from what I’ve gathered is authoritarian powers emerging in some of the most democratic countries in the world. The CCP is obviously behind it. This has been discussed since 2020 about covid-19 being utilized in a way to implement these ideologies with the help of far left governments. </p>
<p>But posting facts and information without linking to credible sources makes us all look like, dare I say, tin foil hat wearing psychopaths. </p>
<p>There is a lot of credible information out there that will help your statements, facts, etc. Information that has been censored, doctors and other medical professionals who have been censored and then had their licenses and credibility taken away. </p>
<p>Of course being a conspiracy theorist is a compliment for being free thinking, people who are against lockdowns, masks, vaccines, and other measures but are already in the negative light because apparently, “we” are the anti-science ones. I know we aren’t because there have been endless studies, endless intellectuals speaking out against the very same arguments we are. </p>
<p>We can make fun of the other side all we want, but the world is at a critical point. People need credible information. This sub will not change anyone’s mind or encourage people to see the other side of the story if they see stream of memes meant to make fun of people who have been literally brainwashed by mainstream media and CCP agenda. </p>
<p>I hope you don’t take this the wrong way, but if possible just please provide links to sources when you can.</p></p>

        <p>This argument is always coming up, that we need to show others how serious we are. There's nearly 70,000 people here now. Some of us make serious posts and some of us don't. But most outsiders don't read any of it and will always see us as nut jobs, whatever we post.</p>

        <p>Preaching to the choir here IMO, most serious posts have legit sources here from what I can see.</p>
<p>Most of the ones that don't are humor posts, opinions or memes and are marked as such.</p>

        <p>That’s true but I’ve seen way to many posts that make bold statements about covid that lacks any supportive evidence and it makes me wonder what the goal of this subreddit is.</p>

        <p>I’ve made a few posts with credible info , I get what you’re saying and agree. However, at this point I come here to vent and be around like minded people. I am in nyc surrounded with mentally unstable lunatics who want me dead because I am not vaccinated and don’t wear a mask outside. I appreciate people who genuinely try to educate others about all of this but it’s not going to be me at this point. I have tried A LOT over the months. It’s exhausting and making me mentally and physically stressed and sick. I can’t believe I’m saying this but I don’t care about them anymore. If they think I am a “conspiracy theorist” I think they are dumb and too brainwashed to think. It’s like speaking to someone wearing headphones. I’m done with it. Good luck to others who are still trying though.</p>

        <p>Because the new normal falls under science, health, political, and geopolitical disciplines, it would be anything written or said by respected authors in those fields of study. Say, academic journals, webinars, etc. </p>
<p>There is no lack of them out there, and they are being rampantly censored on social media due to having an opposing narrative to covid-19 thats being regurgitated by MSM. So a lot of these videos with critical views of covid are being moved to alternative sites like not hire, rumble, etc. </p>
<p>It’s frightening how incessant censorship is on any dissenting voices towards covid-19, regardless of the persons credibility so not a lot of people are going to see it</p>

        <p>Good points.</p>
<p>It's hard sometimes to know what is legit though.</p>
<p>We have seen many stories that are originally buried by mainstream media only to have them change their tune a week later.</p>
<p>The blood clots were denied at first for example.</p>
