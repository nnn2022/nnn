    <strong>It feels great</strong>
    <p><p>This is my first post and I'm happy I found this sub! </p>
<p>I'm in the US, but didn't want to leave a lot of details about myself or my locale, I pushed back against our health department. They have been issuing strongly worded quarantine letters to almost everyone that is a 'close contact' and it's bullshit. They make it sound like orders but they're not. They are recommendations worded like orders to make everyone think they're under house arrest. Finally it happened to me. I had an attorney ready to go and he sent them a letter asking them to clarify if it's an order or a recommendation. I guess we'll see where it goes from here. Tired of all of these counties, cities, states, schools issuing these without checking the law first. They're illegal! Unless the health officer issues a legal quarantine order, these are just pissy worded letters meant to scare people. They're duping the public. They have no transparency and have destroyed what little trust was there.</p></p>
