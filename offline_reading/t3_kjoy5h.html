    <strong>This Sub is Heavily Shilled</strong>
    <p><p>Beware of the paid shills whose mission is fear mongering by making claims that not wearing the muzzle in stores results in severe consequences. </p>
<p>I have NEVER, NOT EVEN ONCE worn the muzzle and I've been to 4 different states including California. </p>
<p>I've been encouraging people to at least try it once to believe me that nothing will happen and no one will harass them for not wearing the muzzle. But these shills keep scaring people. They have a clear mission; to keep the muzzle alive. </p>
<p>I'm urging everybody to at least try it once to believe me no one is going to shoot you. If enough people stop wearing the muzzle we can live a normal life again. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/k84j9c/this_is_how_we_can_go_back_to_normal/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">There is NO OTHER WAY IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO NORMAL.</a></p></p>

        <p>Agreed. I never wear a mask, and I can count on half a hand the number of times it's been an actual problem. And not like this crap where people are getting recorded in stores. I just mean that the business basically turned me away, and I obliged. I just ask them if they discriminate against medical exemptions. They never have an answer, and I just tell them thanks anyway, I'll go shop at [establishment x], they don't discriminate over there.</p>

        <p>Good for you but I wore my mask under my nose in the dollar store and kept getting followed by an old lady who told me to my mask was on wrong the entire time. If you look at local gym Yelp pages from where I live, it’s full of reviews of pictures of people “wearing there mask improperly”.</p>

        <p>Yeah that was true in my state until our governor passed a mandate saying any business who doesn’t enforce the mask wearing is subject to close: the mandate even stated they should call the cops and push trespassing charges, if they don’t, no more business...pretty r-worded, so most people just do the below the nose thing, I try to go to only small places that aren’t run by nazis now.</p>

        <p>So I manage a reasturant in IL. The owner of our business has asked that we inforce mask wearing guidelines in the reastuarnt.  I've gotten into a few situations where guests are standing in the front of our restaurant yelling at me (or sometimes our HS student workers) telling me its not a law, and that I am a sheep. We have signs posted on every entrance letting our guests know that while moving through the restaurant mask wearing is mandatory.  Im not saying where i necessarily stand on the issue personally, but what is it that people hope to accomplish by intentionally not following the rule?  They are disrupting our (already heavily disrupted) business, making our staff uncomfortable and disrupting our guests who understand we are all trying to get through this.  There are potential health code fines for not following the current protocols, and our business is not in a place where we can risk any kind of penalties from the government.  I guess my frustration is that I understand you disagree with the situation, but it shouldn't be the business you're angry at, go March into city hall without your mask and caus a scene there.... Thanks for reading my rant.  Stay safe and healthy!</p>

        <p>If your business is open to the public then it is actually against the law for you to require your customers to wear a mask or be subject to any kind of medical intervention. You do not get to just make up rules because you own the business. Your health department has tricked you into breaking the law, and if you’re not already bankrupted from the lockdown “orders” you certainly will be from the discrimination suits.</p>

        <p>This line of thinking is so gross to me.  We are trying to make it through these incredibly hard times, and trying and navigate waters none of us have been in, and the response is that people will sue us so we lose our business? So these people do not actually care for business owners, and people who are affected?  You would sue us into bankruptcy because we are being told to operate in a certain way by our local municipalities?  American patriots!  Most business i know of (including ours) are attempting to offer ways of ordering (pickup, curbside) for people who will not wear masks.  These issues are far more complicated then you are making it out to be its not back and white.  If you have a problem with mask mandates be angry at those imposing them, not the people who are trying to stay aflot and make sure our business safe so we can keep our communities employed,and keep food on our tables.</p>

        <p>My “line of thinking” is irrelevant to your ability to adhere to the laws in your state. As a business owner in California I understand the pressure and complications and risks to businesses. I also wish no misfortune on your or anyone else’s business, but I’m perfectly capable off seeing the cause and effect of where this is taking us. “Hard times” do not make it okay for you to beak the law, and just because you are being “told” to operate a certain way does not absolve your responsibility to behave lawfully towards the public. A public facing business cannot require patrons to wear masks any more than it can require them to wear turbans or yamakas, and you can expect similar penalties for either. Thousands of businesses across the country think their health department’s “guidance” gives them a green light to violate laws and regulations currently on the books, and it will be a sad day when the wheel of justice eventually grinds its way to their doorstep.</p>

        <p>And to clarify what I mean by making g my staff uncomfortable.  Its not just because they aren't wearing a mask,  its that a 16-22 year old is now put in a position where they have to tell a full grown adult they can't enter, while the full grown adult knows very well they can't and are just trying to prove their point.  It just seems like these acts of defiance are directed at the wrong people.</p>

        <p>Well technically it is NOT law. It's a mandate. Laws are legislated usually with the publics consent or the bill is introduced by a member of the public which then becomes law. All mandates are issued by officials with no public debate which immediately makes it repugnant to the constitution in the US at least. The middle ground you're looking for is a sign clarifying that, while you are cooperating with the mandate, if you cannot were a mask due to a medical exemption we will assume that is the case and will not prevent you from entering our establishment. Please keep your distance at the request of other patrons and our staff. Thank you. That should solve the problem and increase your business.</p>

        <p>Have you worn a mask your entire life? In 2009, when the swine flu outbreak occurred did you stay indoors, wear a mask, socially distance? In 2015, when flu deaths were at their highest in the UK did you run outside yellow bloody murder to everyone caring to carry on living? I highly doubt you did. Stop jacking off your ego by thinking you’re “saving lives” this time around when the same shit that has happened for decades is happening now. You get your primary value from thinking you’re being an obedient, society-driven individual doing the work of an angel when in actuality you are nothing more than a person with no ability to critically think, research, ask questions, <em>see</em> literal evidence in front of you that this is being blown way out of proportion. Because it is there, you are just refusing to see because that would mean that you have been lied to by the people who are supposedly so goddamn invested in whether you live or not. Go ask the nurses and doctors making fucking dancing videos to do their due diligence and lock yourself up in your house forever if that’s what you want. But stop acting like you’re doing anything more than inflating your precious ego by repeating what the sacred news channel told you to say and to think.</p>
