    <strong>I hate online events</strong>
    <p><p>I know that they were around before covid but now people act like they can completely replace in person events and they can't. People who are introverts say things like, "I feel sorry for you extroverts because I'm loving this hahaha." Well I have news for you, I'm the biggest fucking introvert. I am as introverted as they come but I have enough sense to tell you that online anything can never replace in person stuff. Online events are boring! There's no experience, it's like watching a Youtube video. Sure it might be okay in the moment but it's not memorable! I want to dress up nicely, drive far distances, and feel the excitement of going to see whatever event I'm going to in person!! Could you imagine going to an online concert? Meeting your favorite celebrity over a fucking zoom call? Virtual weddings and parties? I know some of you have already experienced these things and I have one question for you guys.. How are those fun? What's the point? And no, getting dressed up to sit in front of a computer monitor is not going to make it anymore of an experience or fun. What is actually going on in the heads of people who think these things can replace having an actual experience!?!?</p></p>

        <p>What I mean is that we do not take care of the spiritual side of our existence. Sure, having technology has massively improved our quality of life, but it will never ever be able to replace the real life interactions we've relied on for the entire existence of humanity.</p>

        <p>yeah, im an introvert also and tbh the first lockdown was fine especially the novelty of wfh but now its starting to hit. I still need a small amount of socialization once in a while but now its really to much. I cant even imagine what it must be like for extroverts.</p>

<p>the work from home adds to it also , it just feels ive been living the same day for the past 2 months and theres no end in sight with their bullshit. they even admitted vaccines wont change shit</p>

        <p>Well aware of that. I have major social anxiety, and personally, I force myself to go out from time to time. Sometimes I just need it! I also like to drink socially as it eases my social anxiety. It sucks that some people are too scared to do these things anymore..</p>

        <p>Absolutely no sense. I went to a store the other day and asked the cashier to wrap my items because they were offering free gift wrap. After scanning all of my items, bagging them, and handing them to me she says, "no, I actually can't wrap them because of covid, but I can give you the gift wrap and you can do it yourself!" I know it's not the cashiers fault but my god how silly! No sense I'm telling you lol</p>

        <p>I have social anxiety and I feel the whole new normal is torture for people like you and me. Being isolated has made made my anxiety worse since I have less opportunities to interact with people and many of them are filled with stressors like wondering if I’m standing too close or whether I need to be wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>My office had a casual zoom meeting right before Thanksgiving.  I logged on, expecting to hear people's holiday plans.  For the first 5 minutes it was nothing but the most dire doomer talk I have ever heard.  One of my coworkers (who I used to like) said, "If I kill someone, how will I live with that for the rest of my life?"</p>
<p>I logged off.</p>

        <p>I was a doomsayer (is that the right word for it?) at the beginning of all of this. I was scared about catching the virus and passing it on to vulnerable people, I went out and started panic buying (which I really regret), I was freaking out because the country was low on ventilators and ppe. I look back and feel embarrassed of how I acted. Now I feel like I'm seeing right through everything and everyone around me has just lost all of their common sense. I went to a store the other day that was offering free gift wrap. I asked the cashier if she could wrap my items for me. After touching all of my items, bagging them, and handing them to me she says, "no we're actually not allowed to because of covid, but I can give you the gift wrap and you can wrap it yourself!" I know it's not her fault but this is what I'm talking about! Aboslutely no sense, at all!</p>

        <p>Same. I was ready for some serious devastation, while the masses were super complacent. My expectation at the time was 100x more dire than what doomers think will happen. Since none of that happened, by my standards this pandemic was a nothing burger.</p>

        <p>I'm an "essential worker" and I was getting mad at people for coming into our store with their families. Our work printed off papers to hand to the police in case we got questioned about why we were out (never happened). I sat in the office and cried to my boss about how hopeless I felt, and I have an amazing boss. He comforted me with facts, and told me that there was no way anyone would conform with this crap past a couple of months..and at the time I didn't believe it but he was mostly right. At least in my state most people are out like it's normal again. I have nightmares every night normally but during those few months I would wake up most mornings in a panic attack. Yup, crazy times...crazy times..</p>

        <p>That <em>might</em> be better than this half-assed version. A few days with nobody picking up trash, nobody fixing problems with the Internet service providers, nobody delivering mail, etc. and everybody who's begging for a lockdown would beg for it to be lifted. Maybe they'd think twice about doing it again.</p>

        <p>If social distancing isn't necessary when you're wearing a mask, then why can't we just reopen in full while requiring masks? That's a standard I'm willing to follow. I'm not really a fan of this complete overhaul of life. Seems kinda deliberate tbh.</p>

        <p>Earlier this year, I got shanghaied into an online group that does those sorts of things.  The meetings I've been to have been boring and depressing: I just sit there while ONE person talks and talks and talks about shit that is of NO interest to me whatsoever. </p>
<p>Next time someone in that group says, "Let's do another ZOOM meeting, that would be awesome!", I'll reply "Maybe for you, but not for me. No thanks. Bye!"</p>
<p>Back in June, I was forced to "attend" a ZOOM birthday party.  What fun--NOT!</p>

        <p>Like many here, I’m an introvert. Very much so. And it’s a problem. I’d like to not be, and at the beginning of the year I was taking steps to fix it. And then lockdowns screwed that up.</p>
<p>And the problem is, lockdowns play into exactly what I like... which is bad. It reinforces my own bad habits.</p>
<p>The only saving grace, really, is that I’ve been on military orders for half the year, and while there are restrictions, in practical terms, when you’re at work or hanging out off duty, we act like normal people. Especially since we all live together anyway.</p>
<p>Also, I want to echo the sentiments I saw in another comment: “without human interaction we aren’t really alive”.</p>

        <p>Few things in life make me feel as alive and human as when I am out enjoying live music and dancing with my fellow man, enjoying art made by our fellow man.  The other day a woman at work accidentally ran into me and instinctively held my arm when she apologized, it feel so wonderful to have a physical connection with another human being.  I always hated shaking hands with people but now I dream of it.  My quality of life is far lower due to the loss of human connection in it.</p>

        <p>I find online conferences to be far more stressful and exhausting than RL meetings - and I'm 100% an introvert misanthrope loner. BUT: in a RL setting, sometimes this person talks, sometimes another and there is always a certain "flux" of attention. Sometimes the attention is on you yourself, then on another person - and you instinctively know where the focus of attention is at a specific point of time. But at online conferences, the little video camera is always focused on you, and you're watched every single minute. I think you instinctively get very self-conscious over the fact that you always see yourself in one of those little windows. There never is a moment for you to relax as you know that the focus is currently on the other person speaking.</p>
<p>For private things ... a musician's Youtube channel I follow recently announced a virtual concert at "dreamstage". Dremastage live stream concerts and sells tickets to this virtual concert. But ... uh ... I mean, that's still just a live stream into an empty studio? I totally support supporting artists via Patreon, but honestly, I don't really feel like buying a "ticket" for a """virtual concert""", i.e. a live stream. And chatting in the group chat of some live stream is definitely NOT the same as the non-verbal and "spiritual" interaction with a live audience - who are supposed to shut up and listen to the music at actual concerts.</p>
<p>It's all total bullshit. All just a bunch of euphemisms: "Home Office" makes it sound cozy and comfy: relaxing on your recliner with a cup of tea and being lazy with fully pay ... but in reality, you just have more work and are imprisoned in "home office", have MORE work and are supposed to be on-call 24/7. And "virtual concerts" are just livestreams you have to pay for.</p>

        <p>I agree with you 100% ! I hate the fact their trying to make things like convenstions "virtual" I'm sorry but I'm not going on camera to show of my cosplay that I've worked hard on my cosplays are met to be enjoyed in person.  The point of  consis to enjoy the experience and to take pics with other cosplayers or have people take pics with you and other crap! I would even be happy if they at least make the con an outdoor event because at least you can interact with fellow peers.</p>

        <p>Before the lockdown I did loads of things online which I really enjoyed (some even worked better online than in person) but obviously this is only true for certain activities. So I know that there are virtual things which can absolutely work....my problem is that people are insisting that EVERY SINGLE THING is equally good online as IRL, when that is clearly not true. If they just acknowledged the differences I would feel much better about it...instead they're all acting brainwashed saying how wonderful our zoom &lt;whatever&rt; is going to be.</p>

Hanging out with friends before internet-in-your-pocket, hell, even before texting, was a completely different world. These young people have NO idea what they are missing. And now? Jesus, if this goes on long enough, some children might never experience the world pre-2020, which was already a hollow shell of a much fuller, less-electronically-mediated social reality before then.</p>
<p>When I was young and the Internet was just starting to reach the mainstream (mid-90s), I used to fantasize about being able to interact with the entire world from the comfort of my computer - see everything, be 'plugged in' to live happenings, etc. (My imagination didn't even scratch the surface of what we actually have access to now - livestreaming, MMOs, reddit, twitter, etc)</p>
<p>Well, if I had any doubts that threshold had been crossed, they are ALL GONE NOW post-lockdown. We're all in the 'disembodied voyeur' bubble now.</p>
<p>And my verdict on that kind of 'life': it fucking sucks and it's trash. Take me back. Nuke all the technology. And they have the nerve to keep saying that this shit "connects" us. No, it doesn't, not even close. For all I know ya'll are a bunch of GPT-3 bots.</p>

        <p>I'm at the age where many of my close friends have moved away. Maybe because of that, I've greatly enjoyed the group zoom calls we've done on people's birthdays or whatever, because I'm interacting with people I wouldn't see in real life anyway. I have continued to see a close group of about 5 friends in real life during the pandemic (down from the 20-plus person patties we would have on a weekly basis), and small socially distanced birthday parties for the nieces and nephews in my life. As for concerts and stuff, I've gone a year without attending a concert before, and I can do it again. I also recently got a VR headset, and there are interactive ways of meeting and watching movies or concerts or whatever with others. My brother and I watched the Mandalorian together in VR a few weeks ago, and it was very fun.</p>

        <p>I completely understand if it's people you can't usually see in person. I too have used video calls for that purpose. Technology is wonderful that way. As far as concerts go, I was really just giving an example of something that can never, in my opinion, be replaced. I've never attended a concert in my life, but if I do it's going to be in person.</p>

        <p>That's great for you, but vr headsets are expensive at 299 dollars.</p>
<p>&rt;and there are interactive ways of meeting and watching movies or concerts or whatever with others. </p>
<p>Not a total replacement</p>

        <p>Agreed on both counts. I was lucky to receive my Quest 2 as a gift.</p>
