    <strong>How the Grinch Stole Mardi Gras</strong>
    <p><p>How the Grinch stole Mardi Gras</p>
<p>Every Who Dat down in Who Datville liked Mardi Gras a lot.
But the Grinch on Louisiana Avenue did not!</p>
<p>The Grinch hated Mardi Gras! The whole Mardi Gras season!
Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason.</p>
<p>It could be, perhaps, her custom shoes were too tight.
It could be her head wasn't screwed on just right.</p>
<p>But I think that the most likely reason of all
May have been that her heart was ten sizes too small.</p>
<p>But, whatever the reason, her heart or her shoes,
She stood there on Mardi Gras Eve hating all of their views.</p>
<p>For she knew every Who Dat uptown to the quarter
must be partying ignoring her executive orders.</p>
<p>"And they're hanging their decorations," she snarled with a sneer.
"Tomorrow is Mardi Gras! It's practically here!"</p>
<p>Then she growled, with her Grinch fingers nervously drumming,
"I must find some way to keep Mardi Gras from coming!</p>
<p>For, tomorrow, I know all the Who Dat ‘s near and far
Will wake bright and early. They'll rush for their Bars!</p>
<p>And then! Oh, the noise! Oh, the noise! Noise! Noise! Noise!
There's one thing I hate! All the NOISE! NOISE! NOISE! NOISE!</p>
<p>They'll stand close together, and spread their disease
They'll stand not sit, and do as they please</p>
<p>"And they'll sing! And they'll sing! And they'll SING! SING! SING! SING!"
And the more the Grinch thought of this Who Dat Mardi Gras Sing,
The more the Grinch thought, "I must stop the whole thing!</p>
<p>Why for 37 months I’ve put up with it now!
I must stop Mardi Gras from coming! But how?"</p>
<p>Then she got an idea! An awful idea!
The Grinch got a wonderful, awful idea!</p>
<p>"I know just what to do!" The Grinch laughed in her throat.
“I'll shut it all down! There will be no more floats!</p>
<p>I’ll shut it all down! I know they will misbehave 
This pre emptive punishment, my career it will save. </p>
<p>The Data not the date even with restrictions in place
I’ll say it’s for the safety and seal Mardi Gras fate. </p>
<p>In the quarter at dawn, all the Who Dats still a-bed,
All the Who Dats still a-snooze, she laughed while she read.</p>
<p>I’ll Shut down their bars! Their restaurants! Their fun!
Doubling my restrictions so they will know I have won. </p>
<p>On the second floor, buried deep in City Hall
She issued her orders for one and for all.</p>
<p>"Pooh-pooh to the Who Dats!" she was grinchily humming.
"They're finding out now that Mardi Gras not coming!</p>
<p>They're just waking up! I know just what they'll do!
Their mouths will hang open a minute or two
Then the Who Dats down in Who Datville will all cry boo-hoo!</p>
<p>That's a noise," grinned the Grinch, "that I simply must hear!"
She paused, and the Grinch put a hand to her ear.</p>
<p>And she did hear a sound , she swears it was so
It started in low, then it started to grow.</p>
<p>But this sound wasn't sad!
Why, this sound sounded glad!</p>
<p>Every Who Dat in WhoDatville, the tall and the small,
Were singing and drinking with no parades at all!</p>
<p>She hadn't stopped Mardi Gras from coming! It came!
Somehow or other, it came just the same!</p>
<p>And the Grinch, with her grinch teeth clinched tight as a fist,
She Stood totally puzzled. "How is it like this ?</p>
<p>It came without ladders! I took away their needs!
It came without floats, bourbon street, and their beads!"</p>
<p>She puzzled and puzzled till her puzzler was sore.
Then the Grinch thought of something she hadn't before.</p>
<p>Maybe Mardi Gras, she thought, isn’t dictated by my door.
Maybe Mardi Gras, perhaps, means a little bit more!</p>
<p>So what happened next? Well, in Who Datville they say
The Grinch never learned until her election day!</p>
<p>So to all the Who Dats and to especially the Grinch,
our spirit won’t be crushed not even by one inch</p>
<p>This year maybe different but Mardi Gras will always be
No grinch can steal it just as long as we have we.</p></p>

        <p>Yes...I feel that it won’t be until late summer before she lets off the gas. The rest of the country will be wide open and we will be in a phase 3.675 to protect from variants.</p>
