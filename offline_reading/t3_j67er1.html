    <strong>Corona Is Part Of Their "Revolution" - But Where Will It Lead? Could It Backfire?</strong>
    <p><p>For at least three decades, the powers that be have pumped up the bread and circuses to distract the proles from rising inequality, falling real wages, consolidation of power by the politically connected, and the cancer-like growth of the authoritarian surveillance state. Sports, reality TV, the internet, social media, consumption and consumerism - they have all been co-opted to keep the population tame and preserve an illusion of "life is good". A couch potato glued to the Idiot Box on Sundays  cheering on "muh team", or gorging on PornHub, is a citizen not asking questions.</p>
<p>Our masters have tried to use the 'Rona as yet another distraction, and as a vehicle to further advance their collectivist agendas, under the ever-popular banners of "keeping us safe" and "caring about your fellow man".</p>
<p>Have they misplayed this one?</p>
<p>A citizen sitting at home not working, and cut off from the social life he is used to, is a citizen with lots of time on his hands to <em>think</em>. And ask questions. And to start asking "<em>What the actual fuck is going on around here???</em>"</p>
<p>And perhaps to have an epiphany - that won't end well for our masters...</p>
<p>What say you?</p>

        <p>Even though I'm still working they took away everything that makes life enjoyable short of working and killing myself. So I've had way too much time to think the problem is they've taken away my social interactions so I can't discuss these theories with others. All the coffee shops that my buddy and I used to frequent is to go only. I miss late night talks over coffee. This is depressing as fuck.</p>

        <p>How can they distract the faceless masses (pun intended) with bread and circuses when the circus is banned and they canâ€™t afford bread?</p>

        <p>Our only hope is that you're right and people wake up. Not looking promising though.</p>
