    <strong>The easiest way to make a Doomer lose their mind.</strong>
    <p><p>Say "I'd rather Covid than take the vaccine" or "I'll take my chances with Covid."
Seriously, they will go crazy when you say this. It's hilarious.</p></p>

        <p>That's perfectly fine it's your choice but please educate yourself on the long term and permanent effects of Covid including lung and organ damage and cognitive problems.  Then compare them to the risks of taking the vaccine.  </p>
<p>If you refuse to get vaccinated then do not judge those who do and until the virus is under control you should follow preventative guide lines to prevent spreading it to others who haven't yet been vaccinated but wish to be.  Consider not only yourself but the risk you put others at and when you do eventually get Covid don't complain about it or expect the world to revolve around you if you need medical attention or have complications or end up infecting a friend or family member. </p>
<p>It's that simple. </p>
<p>So sit down and shut up and you do you without trying to seek attention by trying to intentionally annoy people.</p>
