        <p>I think there’s a lot of CCP subversion of their government. They recently tried to label what’s happening to the Uyghurs genocide but suddenly stopped. There are similar efforts in a lot of other Western countries but not as strong.</p>

        <p>If I was a western country leader I would urge my industry leaders to pull out their factories from China until China stops the genocide. I’m sure Mexico,Central America and South America will play... it’s not like the US hasn’t propped up governments there before.</p>
<p>If companies don’t comply I will raise domestic taxes on the goods they make over in China and because these people only love money they will listen to me.</p>
<p>Next thing is Canada needs new military equipment. We can’t rely on the US to fight our battles.</p>

        <p>I wish they would put those extra taxes on Chinese goods too.</p>
<p>As for Canada, I think they’re at a similar stage as New Zealand. The US is still in okay shape, Trump put Biden between a cock and a hard place before he left office in that area at least.</p>

        <p>Title is a bit of a click-bait.  As pointed by others, you're required to be vaxxed, if you work at certain government-run facilities.  Fines are between $300-$1,000 if you don't.</p>
<p>That aside, still a shitty move.  Imagine having to quit or be fired, from a well-paid job, because you won't take that chemical potion.</p>
<p>Also, how the fuck is this not against Nuremberg code?  Their actions amount to coercion, albeit, they are not putting a gun to their heads.</p>

        <p>Can anyone comment on the legality of this?</p>
<p>As I understand it - in the US - these "gene therapies" are licensed for emergency use.</p>
<p>Does NZ have some medical regulator or laws designed to protect people from poorly tested drugs? Or being coerced into taking poorly tested drugs? Or protect them from Governments who lie to them, telling them the drugs are extensively tested.</p>

        <p>New Zealand used it's normal standard medical approval regime (Medsafe) that it uses for all medication to be administered in New Zealand. Because of it's Covid status it could afford to take it's time to do this. In that regard it was not for "emergency use". </p>
<p>This isn't a law but a health order and it is only for frontline border workers of which most of them have already been vaccinated. The Ministry of Health put in a deadline of May 1st for all frontline workers to be vaccinated and this is the paperwork that enforces that deadline.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Bill of Rights specifically says that people can refuse medical treatment and most of the people that refused were redeployed but 9 lost their jobs. I'm sure they will challenge that decision in court and it will be decided there.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure if there is or isn't tbh but it wasn't under consideration in the first place. I know there is a process that can go through the ministry for individual cases (eg a kid has a rare form of cancer and needs a special drug that hasn't already been approved and is not in NZ. The minister can grant use of that in exceptional circumstances) but that is different to this case with Pfizer.</p>

        <p>This is not a law. It is a health order issued by the ministry of health. It is the essentially the paperwork for making it mandatory for all border workers to have a vaccine. The ministry issued a deadline of the 1st of May for all border workers to be vaccinated and this is what enforces that. Since at least 97% of these workers have already had the vaccine and the rest were to get their 1st shot before the 1st of May it doesn't affect many people.  Of those hundred or so that wouldn't get a shot those that could be redeployed have been redeployed and from those that couldn't 9 have had their contract terminated. You do not get fined or imprisoned for not getting one, you just can't stay in a job that possibly comes into contact with infected people daily. This had to be done under a health order because border workers don't have terminology for being vaccinated in their employment contracts like, for examples nurses. The headline is a bit dramatic.</p>
