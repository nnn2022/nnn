<p>now you are just making shit up.</p>
<p>i don't accept any form of so called 'government' currently existing as legitimate. the only legimate function of 'government' is to protect my God given rights to life, liberty and private property. </p>
<p>show me a gov anywhere that does that and i will support that one.</p>
<p>and i certainly reject and do not support any 'state'</p>
<p>all states are founded lies, funded by theft and upheld by violence and wholesale and retail murder.</p>
<p>how many 'mindless' volumes does that speak?</p>

        <p>Look man, it’s easy enough to say these things. But one question, do you regularly use seatbelts and headlights? These are also forms of government control. When seatbelts first came in, there were plenty of sheep who accepted them, but a few independent thinkers and real men were courageous enough to stand up to this form of tyranny. Now, fast forward a few decades, and look where we are. I feel that if we do not rectify this problem now, we are doomed to go down the same route with masks, lockdowns, etc. Its a genuine concern of mine and one of my greatest fears.</p>

        <p>i've already commented on seat belts, your headlight thing is a stretch, even horse a buggies used them with out need of any fucking 'laws' or dictates. as i said it's the same as the ''do you wear pants?' bullshit</p>
<p>the same with the model T, headlight and windshields, neither of which were mandated by gov into existense</p>
<p>people use head lights because they desire to see in the dark....</p>
<p>traffic control is just that, control. cases abound that traffic light cause congestion.</p>
<p>i don't jump in front of moving buses or run in traffic either, is that a form of gov control because the gov declares it to be illegal?</p>
<p>suicide is 'illegal', is that what prevents me from offing myself?</p>
<p>just because the government took over things does not mean they didn't exist previously and privately</p>
<p>i won't even wear a fucking 'mask'</p>
<p>i have already and frequently called for action in the form of self defense, literally putting these all these tyrants in their rightful place, which is BELOW me who they claim to 'serve' though i did not ask them to.</p>
<p>they all need to be tarred and feathered (if that will suffice) and outcast from lawful society.</p>
<p>your post is a shitty way (ineffective)  to make the point you are attempting to make.</p>

        <p>I'm pretty sure people use headlights so that they don't drive into a wall or the lights just come on automatically or they don't want people pulling out in front of them, not because the government tells them to and cares about them and wants them to be safe.</p>

        <p>The thing is, that’s exactly the type of thing the government says about face diapers, that they are some sort of magical shield against getting corona virus. They are wrong. They are both forms of population control, both of which make it extremely easy to tell the sheep from the men. You can’t condemn one and mindlessly accept the other.

        <p>I guess this user has a point. Ultimately the only real difference between a law requiring the use of headlights at night and a law requiring a person to wear a facemask are the levels of popular support. But there's nothing wrong with that. </p>
<p>I don't think there's anything wrong with admitting that there's a difference between laws which enforce generally accepted social norms (like using your headlights), and laws that make a judgment on a matter that to many remains largely unsettled. </p>
<p>Do masks really work? If so, to what degree? Does their effectiveness justify the level of intrusion they impose on the wearer?  Is it really fair to compare the obvious desirability of using your headlights at night to the unsettled science surrounding the use of cloth facemasks for protection against viruses? You be the judge... Or should you be the judge? Should the government make the decision for you?</p>
