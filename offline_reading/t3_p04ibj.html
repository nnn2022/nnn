    <strong>Larry Sanger (Wikipedia Co-Founder): The Astonishing Hubris of a Global Experimental Vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>&rt;It is an objective, indisputable fact: never in  the history of the world has there been a global push to administer an  experimental medicine to all of humanity, billions of us, at the same  time.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I want you to stop and reflect on that. Imagine the hubris it  required both to carry out this plan and to propagandize the world to  carry it out.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“Hubris?” you ask. “What do you mean?”<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The Covid vaccines are experimental. The FDA has not approved them.  Most vaccines require years to test and approve, in no small part  because we want to make sure they don’t have dangerous long-term side  effects, which they can have; the CDC has published <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/concerns-history.html">a list of problems</a> with selected <em>approved</em> vaccines. Many experimental vaccines never make it out of the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/vaccine-development-barriers-coronavirus/">experimental phase</a>. CNN <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/01/health/eua-coronavirus-vaccine-history/index.html">made similar points</a>  back when Trump was, wrongheadedly (I thought so at the time) pushing  for rapid approval of the Covid vaccines. Of course, the mercurial news  organization hastened to forget all that when the Biden administration  decided rapid vaccine deployment was a good idea. They shouldn’t have:  for all the good they certainly have done, physicians warn us that  vaccines <a href="https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/vaccine-side-effects-and-adverse-events">can be dangerous</a> for some, and experimental vaccines are, naturally, even more so.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;It is an objective, indisputable fact: never in the  history of the world has there been a global push to administer an  experimental medicine to all of humanity, billions of us, at the same  time.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Again, my point is simple and absolutely factual. Again:<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<em>experimental vaccine</em><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<em>billions of people</em> (over <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations">two billion</a>)<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<em>at the same time</em><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;You have to be willing to trust the welfare of <em>billions of people</em>  not just to the honesty of our leaders and scientists—because things  can go wrong for decent people. You must also trust their competence—and  not just that, because competent people can make surprising,  unforeseeable mistakes. You must also trust that we avoided the worst,  that we dodged a bullet, and that they actually <em>succeeded</em> in making a <a href="https://undercurrents723949620.wordpress.com/2021/05/22/how-many-have-died-from-covid-vaccines/">more or less</a> safe vaccine.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Of course, maybe they did. I sure hope so. But what if we discover  some horrifically high incidence of catastrophic side-effects that do  not show up for two or five or ten years? Scientists tell us that that  is possible. It is unfortunately possible that more people will die from  these experimental vaccines than would have died from a virus that  kills fewer than 1% of those who contract it.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Do not misunderstand me. I am not claiming that is happening. I am  not even saying that it is terribly likely. I am saying it is <em>possible,</em> because these are experimental vaccines.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Frankly, the hubris required for carrying out this plan, and for  taking the lead in propagandizing the world to carry it out, is  jaw-dropping and scary to me. If a world leader is willing to take such  gambles with all of humanity, what else are they prepared to do? I  really wonder. If suddenly you became a president or top medical system  leader or media organization owner, would <em>you</em> want to take an  action that, if you were wrong, might spell the death of millions?  First, do no harm. We haven’t heard that old medical byword very much  recently.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;My family received our childhood vaccinations, by the way, with no  issues. I am not an anti-vaxxer. I am an  anti-global-all-at-once-experimental-vaxxer. There is a big difference.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;This is not even to touch the question whether these experimental vaccines should be <em>mandated,</em>  i.e., if you should lose your basic civil rights if you fail to be  vaccinated. Maybe I will write about that question, definitely a  non-medical question, separately another time. There is indeed much,  much more to say.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;But my present point is simple: <em>experimental vaccine—billions of people—at the same time.</em> It utterly boggles the mind that so many otherwise reasonable people have been influenced to think this is a good idea.</p>
