        <p>Indeed </p>
<p>All vaccines injure and kill people. They spend anywhere from 7 to 55 years trying to make that list as small as possible using animal trials, multiple  clinical trials, reformulating, more trials etc.</p>
<p>Even with all that death and injury still occur. </p>
<p>This is why Reagan removed the ability to sue the drug companies for damages, that responsibility now resides with that tax payer.</p>
<p>These took less than a year. Skipped the animal trials. No long term clinical trials to then reformulate to then go through more rounds of clinical trials to ensure safety and efficacy.</p>
<p>Who knows what is going to happen. Isreal went all in on Phizer, quickly got it into their population, and are now actively pursuing investigation into widespread heart failure.</p>
<p>You couldn't pay me to get this injected into me.</p>
<p>Ask me in 10 years when the homo sapien animal trials are finished.</p>

        <p>What's really frustrating is they'll say "let's give them information so they are empowered" but have you ever talked to a doctor outside of a clinical setting? By far, in my experience, the profession mostly likely to completely dismiss anything and not answer questions. Physicists have a saying that if you can't explain it to a random person at a bar you don't understand it yourself. Programmers advocate open source code and peer review (at least the good ones). But question medical dogma? No sir.</p>
<p>But the entire medical education system is designed to produce that mentality...</p>

        <p>I'm (un)lucky enough to have a couple of doctors for friends, and they are absolutely the dumbest people outside of their specialty, and even there, it's 99% static knowledge from school. Doctors are no more likely to be smart <em>or</em> good than the general population.</p>

        <p>You know what's even more incredible? More than a BILLION shots have been given throughout the world and the percentage of serious complications is barely even a blip on the screen. A total non-issue. Particularly when compared to contracting Covid. </p>
<p>Now if you think computer chips or some nonsense are being implanted I'm not sure what to say. But a certain point, I'd like to think that EVIDENCE runs through the minds of those who live in a world of conspiracy. Maybe not though. At least not in this sub.

        <p>Your fear and overwhelming desire to be told what to do are what is keeping this nonsense going. If people like you realized that the government and big pharma not only doesn't care about you, but actually hates you and is actively trying to harm you, then we'd be done with this utter BS. </p>
<p>The federal government has never had your best interest in mind. That should be abundantly clear to everyone.  Pharma only makes money when you're sick. Drug companies and the government have spent the majority of the last century proving themselves to be dangerous liars, but fools like you immediately come to heel when they tell you to.</p>

        <p>Can you even think about what you are arguing for before you accuse us of shit? Please explain how me not getting a vaccination has any impact on you whatsoever. If you are in an at-risk category then cool, go get your vaccine. You will have 95% immunity against a virus that you were already unlikely to get, and in the insanely unlikely instance that you catch it you will experience a significantly reduced viral load and face a 0.0005% chance of sever complications resulting in hospitalization. If we are using hospitalization as the metric for when to enforce covid-restrictions, then there is absolutely no reason for me to get vaccinated. I have a miniscule risk of hospitalization if I catch it and there is a non-existent risk of me spreading it to someone and causing a hospitalization. Therefore me not getting vaccinated has little to no impact on me, and absolutely zero impact on you and the general public. So why the fuck do you people get a giant boner for forcing vaccinations on people who do not want to participate in history's quickest vaccine rollout when we are well aware of the dangers of rushed vaccines after the swine flu vaccine disaster.</p>
