    <strong>A doctor explained to me, off the record, that although viruses always mutate to become less lethal but more contagious, this won't be the case for the jabbed population - they will die.</strong>
    <p><p>He explained if a person who's had the jab has to fight off C19 or a variant, then jab is going to dominate that response 100%. If the person had natural immunity and then got the jab, the jab still dominates the response 100%, and is the only response. As soon as there's a variant that evades the jab, it will run unimpeded through the body while the immune response is firing at 110% attempting to fight it with no luck. </p>
<p>Whereas the body would develop a response in real time and eventually healthy individuals would recover, jabbed individuals will only have the jab to fight it - no natural response can be offered. So you're only as good as your latest booster.</p>
<p>He speculates that the jabbed populace has signed up for a forced continuity program for life, with multiple boosters per year to stay up to date with the latest strains. </p>
<p>And all this while the unjabbed will be fighting weaker and weaker variations with greater and greater natural immunity. </p>
<p>Makes the choice pretty damn clear. Has anyone seen anything written up on this theory? He's a heart surgeon in NYC, and he's expecting a long winter ahead.</p></p>

        <p>So if this is true. this is why England is seeing more fully vaccinated people die from the delta variant right? Meanwhile in the US they are desperately trying to convince us that ONLY unvaccinated people are dying…..even though at least 1 state has announced that multiple fully vaccinated people have died…..</p>

        <p>Question. Do you personally know anyone that's died from covid?  Because I don't. Not saying nobody has, but the closest for me is my parent's friend's mother, 80 something years old with terminal breast cancer died in hospice care, of course it was covid.. but I mean people who wouldn't have passed within say a month anyway catching covid and dying. </p>
<p>I know a lot of people who would have said something if someone they knew died and I haven't heard anything.  People getting mildly sick,  sure but no deaths. I see that death count high score the media likes to show and think how is it possible that nobody in my group or their groups have passed from covid?</p>

        <p>I also don't know anyone who died of it, and no one who knows someone who did... On the other hand I do know people who died within 1 week of receiving the second shot and others who of course independently of the vx developed heart issues and other long lasting side effects. The media shows us what they want us to believe.</p>

        <p>I know several people who've gotten covid, but have been fine overall. Nobody has died or even had to go to the hospital due to it. Not to say it can't happen, but yeah.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I know a handful of people who've been hospitalized from the shot or have gotten extremely ill from it.</p>

        <p>I know a ton of people who’ve gotten it, but only one that died and one that almost died. Both of those two were somewhat unhealthy but relatively young (50 something for almost died, 60 something that died). </p>
<p>I agree it’s being exaggerated but people have definitely passed from covid.</p>

        <p>I don't doubt that people have, but the reports say over 600,000. I really want to see the total average deaths in the US for 2016 - 2020, curious if 2020 saw a big jump or if the people would have died anyway. I saw some numbers from the UK and 2020 actually had fewer average deaths overall</p>

        <p>600K+ is such an obvious lie. All you have to do is look at the massive DROP in reported deaths from pretty much all common causes. Magically, this virus has almost totally wiped out deaths from heart failure, cancer, diabetes, influenza, etc...</p>
<p>They are counting anything and everything as "covid death". Even people that fully recovered months before.</p>
<p>Now they're counting people dying from the "vaccines" as covid deaths as well. </p>
<p>Realistically, the number is much closer to 60K in America.</p>

        <p>I know someone who died of covid. He was a pretty great person so it's shitty, but he was in his 40s, not obese, but overweight, and african-american so there's the potential for low vitamin d levels.  I also know two others that definitely had it, my step-brother and a person I work with. Covid is real, but the amount of cases and deaths are being greatly exaggerated by the media and our governments. For what reason? Can't say.</p>

        <p>I know of people that died from it. But, they died in states very early on when they were placing everyone on ventilators. So I suspect that they probably wouldn't have died with other preventative treatments, but we're unnecessarily put on vents and killed.</p>

        <p>I know one man,morbidly obese and he was found in the bed with the phone in one hand, possibly calling for help. He died of lung embolia.The  Emergency ambulance has denied to take him to the hospital after his problems with breathing because it was not severe enough to them.  He died because of lack of treatment, doctors in my country didn't even try to cure people. Drink tea and take some paracetamol and this is the result. This man could live a little longer with a help of some early treatment (ivermectin, aspirin, dexametason and so on). He was obese but he could live another few years.
Edit: I'm an oncology nurse and all of our patients got through covid with no major problems.</p>

        <p>People are dying. I don’t know if the numbers are exaggerated, but people are dying. My grandfather who was healthy and my great grandmother both passed from it. One thing that seems suspect to me though is that if someone in a household catches covid, the other members only have a 12% chance of catching it too. Seems rather odd since this virus was able to travel across the whole world. Makes me wonder if this isn’t some series of chemical attacks rather than a contagious virus. Maybe only 12% of the time were 2 members of a household together at the time of dispersal. Just a thought</p>

        <p>I don’t anyone who has died of covid and I know ONE person who has had it. My mother’s best friend, she is a 75 and survived ovarian cancer 2 years ago (and now has really bad damage from radiation that was causing problems and last I heard was getting a colostomy). She lives with her daughters family &amp; one of the teenage grandchildren allegedly got it first &amp; gave it mom and grandma. All 3 had fatigue and cold symptoms for a few days. That was it. My moms friends worst symptom was a bad headache! I question if they even had covid. The daughter got the rapid test. Also another member of the household works at the prison and never got sick. I know covid is real but they are definitely padding the numbers</p>

        <p>I'd believe it for NYC or NJ, again as I stated in other comments- they were putting people on ventilators that had no business being on them. I'd be interested in knowing if those people died early on in the pandemic or later.</p>

        <p>correct, most people i know died before June 2020, that was when NYC had the majority of cases. </p>
<p>I barely know anyone who got it after the summer of 2020, it was not common then at all except for a minute in december.</p>

        <p>Describe to me the nature of these relationships. You pulled an even number (and an increment like 10) which seems highly unlikely. If you want people to believe you, give some backing to it. Genuinely have not experienced this in my own life so I genuinely want to hear someone else's experience. I want to believe you but I need a reason to because I've seen a lot of people claim shit that never happened on this site</p>

        <p>I dont know where you live or how bad covid was for you. But if you think there werent a ton of dead 60yr old people in NYC between march and may, you are crazy. Dont forget, we were only the second big city with an outbreak after Milan. All the doctors were venting because thats what the chinese fuckers told them to do. There was no plasma treatments or steroids in use. </p>
<p>Whatever dont believe me. Listen to the Joe Rogan ivermectin episode from a couple weeks ago. The dr was talking about all the people he had die in the hospital. Its not a myth that people in their 60s died. what the fuck is wrong with people</p>

        <p>Probably- and this is just speculation on my part, we are looking at apples and oranges in England.  Which would you rather be, a vaccinated 80 year old with a 10% chance of vaccine failure, or a health 20 year old who never took a vaccine? The odds of dying at 80 with Covid are so much higher that even with a 90% reduction, you are still more likely to die than an unvaccinated 20 year old.  These data came from a period in time when every older person had priority.  The there is likely a massive age gap between "the vaccinated" and "the unvaccinated". </p>
<p>As for the US: propaganda is as propaganda does.  The public health mentality just looks at lives saved. It is dumbly agnostic to what life is saved.  So, if 1000 kids die from vaccine complications but 1,000,000 80 year olds live an extra 6 months in the nursing home, it was totally worth it, in their view.</p>

        <p>In Australia they closed down society because of someone in their 90s dying, someone that has literally reached beyond the average life expectancy. That life is apparently worth more than the millions of children who have their entire lives ahead of them and are having that chance taken away.</p>

        <p>Funny enough, if you look at the age distribution of Covid death and you overlay it with the age distribution of all death, they are remarkably similar.  It's almost as if weakened people have been dying because of the challenge of a viral illness since the beginning of time.</p>

        <p>Yeah, this actually corroborates what I was saying.  So I think I'll leave it unedited.  According to these data, 70% of the under 50 crowd is unvaccinated.  10% of the over 50 crowd was unvaccinated.   Moreover, you would expect to see about a 1/3 (&rt;50), 2/3 (&lt;50) split but here you are seeing a 1/10 (&rt;50), 9/10 (&lt;50)  split, this means that we are under representing older folks who are likely vaccinated.  So, let's do some quick math.... to bring the sample up to a normal distribution, you would another 40,000 people over 50.  Those people aren't there, because they are all vaccinated and immune.  But, if you gross it up, you'll end up with a death rate of more like 0.5%. In the over 50 crowd.  And if they were unvaccinated, it would be about 5%.  And the vaccine failure rate is 10%, so 0.5% from 5% is about right.  Obviously back of the napkin math.  But it roughly proves that my speculation was correct.  Thanks for your help.</p>

        <p>The most annoying part about that is that it’s the vaccinated people who are driving the evolutionary response by the virus to mutate to vaccine resistant versions. Meanwhile it’s the unvaccinated who are blamed, demonstrating a complete lack of understanding of evolutionary biology. </p>
<p>If you have a new bird species introduced to a region that has a highly specialized ability to spot white rabbits with 90% accuracy, for the most part, only the rabbits without white fur would be able to escape and mate and pass on their black fur genes. </p>
<p>It’s putting evolutionary pressure on the virus in a specific direction. The unvaccinated population is not likely to pressure the virus randomly to evade the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Doctors have to be extra careful of what they say because if they get sued they can lose their practice and their livelihood.</p>
<p>I am still pissed at a doctor in Indianapolis who misread my dad's chart and gave him blood thinners for a clot when he had a long history of ulcers. He nearly killed him with internal bleeding. Another doctor caught it and they got him stabilized. The other doctror told us what happened but said that if we chose to sue he would not testify. </p>
<p>Maybe he was lying and would have been forced to either way but we're not lawyers so we didn't know and let it go.</p>

        <p>Doctors protect their own; nearly always.</p>
<p>The issue is we expect doctors to make life/death decisions with 100.00% accuracy and it just isn't possible.</p>
<p>Most doctors shield each other from being sued if the mistake was easy to make or rarely made. The only time they don't shield each other is usually a pattern forming or a really stupid fuck up that no doctor should ever make.</p>

        <p>I fear that the only way for everyone to finally wake up and for those responsible to get punished for their crimes is for that to happen. If their conspiracy doesn't properly come to light that way then idk how it'll happen and when and by that time it might be too late for most of us who are awake.</p>

        <p>yes. because their body cant adapt at all. the only thing they have to fight covid is the jab, zero natural antibodies. so the variants can infect a jabbed person and if the jab has zero effect on it, ur body naturally cant fight it at all.</p>

        <p>The interesting par tis I wonder if this also stifles the body from other disease responses, as well.  Our bodies are a fine tuned symphony.  When you start messing with it, you open the door to all kinds of things that you never intended to happen.</p>

        <p>The only personal experience I have is my 83 year old dad and my 77 year old mother got the jab on their doctors suggestion and against my better judgement.  Dad got sick and had to be rushed to the hospital two weeks later due to dizziness and exhaustion. Mom went from being a chill pretty spry person to pretty toxic and gets tired way too easy.  And she's been in the hospital for gut problems as well.  Their appetites have also changed and instead of being up past 7 it's not unusual for them to be in bed by 5 and not up till 8.  </p>
<p>This new information scares me because as much as I've accepted that they're pretty close of their lives I really didn't want to expedite the process.  </p>
<p>One of my neighbors who is a prick I admit but he and I get along well enough because I can be one too and he's always out walking his dog and keeps himself fit enough for a 72 year old got the jab 10 days ago.  Day before yesterday he had a stroke and it doesn't look good for him.  </p>
<p>We opted out of it because my wife has Crohns and she has enough big pharma running around in her.  I'm not keen on putting anymore chemicals in her because I've seen her in the ICU three times from the one condition.  I'm not taking it because I don't trust big pharma one little bit.  Never have and never will.  I'll barely take a tylenol for a headache that is probably going to go away in a few hours.  </p>
<p>Anybody remember how they were saying that our over use of antibiotecs was causing and abundance of resistant bacteria a few years back?  </p>
<p>https://www.rchsd.org/health-articles/the-danger-of-antibiotic-overuse/</p>
<p>Hmm... same concept. Granted antibiotics don't work against viruses. But to me there's huge merit in what the good doctor is saying.  </p>
<p>I honestly think the world is setting itself up for another wave of COVID that's going to kill off a whole lot more people than it did the first run.  </p>
<p>I suppose there's a bright side though.  More jobs available and property is going to get cheap.  I live in a pretty much retirement community.  If this does what I fear I'm not going to have many neighbors but a shitload of empty houses around me.</p>

        <p>Yes, this is almost exactly what Geert Vanden Bossche has been saying. This was I think one of his earliest interviews back in March 2021:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJZxiNxYLpc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJZxiNxYLpc</a></p>
<p>He has given quite a few interviews and has made a few videos on his youtube channel. </p>
<p>He was saying that the mass vaccination campaign will put immune pressure on the virus and force it to mutate to become stronger and to evade vaccine induced immunity. So his first point is that the mass vaccination campaign will spawn these new variants. </p>
<p>His second point was basically what this guy was saying... was that the vaccines override your natural immunity and you fight the virus with the vaccine antibodies. That's all well and good, until the virus mutates and now you're fighting a variant with a mutation to the spike protein and the vaccines don't work. He was saying the same thing that basically the vaccinated are left defenseless whereas if you don't take the vaccine, you still have your natural immune system that can fight it. So while the vaccinated are initially better protected than the unvaccinated, as soon as the virus mutates to evade vaccine immunity, you're then left completely unprotected. </p>
<p>The only aspect where they seem to differ is that Geert Vanden Bossche thinks the virus will mutate to become more contagious and more deadly... and this doctor seems to think it will mutate to become more contagious but less deadly. The argument for it becoming more deadly is that the only way the virus can become more contagious is if it make people more sick (so they transmit higher viral loads) and that will result in more deaths. A lot of people dismiss this argument because they say that it's not in the best interests of the virus to kill the host. And I agree that viruses like Ebola run into that problem when you have a death rate of like 80%. But we are so far away from that kind of death rate. We know the current death rate is small... like maybe 0.1% of infections or something like that. If the virus became 1% or 2% lethal, it wouldn't run into the problem of killing the hosts too quickly. There would still be plenty of people to spread the virus. So yes, a virus that is super deadly (killing 80%+ of those it infects), and kills super quickly (within hours or a couple days) makes it difficult for the virus to spread... but we're nowhere near that now. </p>
<p>If the virus is actually mutating to become less deadly, that's one piece of good news in a sea of bad news. I think it's a little early to say whether these new variants, and any future variants, are deadlier to the unvaccinated. But it was never that deadly to begin with... so even if it's twice as deadly, a young and healthy person would still be very unlikely to die.</p>

        <p>Regarding deadlier viruses becoming a thing, it is possible where hosts are asymptomic to the strain. In this case if we vaccinate billions that reduce the symtoms in so that the host stop dying but still spread the disease then the virus may be able to mutate to a deadlier variant and still spread en masse. You could read about marek’s disease in chickens where this scenario seem to have played out. This could also be an issue eventually with these vaccine campaigns.</p>

        <p>The optimistic note about the Marek's disease is that the disease is a form of herpes, so it's constantly shedding for life. So a much greater vector for spreading mutations. But yep, that's my fear too. That the vaccinated will end up breeding a more infectious and deadly version of covid that kills those not vaccinated.</p>

        <p>You know that vaccines simply make your Body produce the correct antibodies before you contract the real virus.
So when it comes, your Body will be able to naturally(!) fight them off. </p>
<p>There is nothing being overriden. </p>
<p>vaccinated and unvaccinated people are susceptible to mutations because they don't have the right antibodies yet.</p>
<p>So you can choose between being immune to at least 1 strain OR none</p>

        <p>Except that these vaccines don't target the nucleus of the virus. They force the body to produce a protein located on the outside spike of that nucleus, which will then force the immune system to create an immune response against that protein.</p>
<p>From what I'm led to understand, people who are infected also develop an immune response to that protein (since that's the body's initial exposure), and if the infection is mild or asymptomatic, that might be all the response that's needed. But a more severe infection requires the body to respond to the nucleus of the virus as well.</p>

        <p>Yes the mRNA vaccines make your Body produce the Spike Protein in large quantities so that your immune Systems springs into action.
It develops an immune Response to the Protein and its production.</p>
<p>Can you point me to a source that describes the Response to the nucleus of the virus? 
I dont know how that works yet.</p>
<p>But still, I was questioning the Hypothesis that the vaccine somehow overwrites my natural immune Response.
I haven't seen a good explanation for that!</p>

        <p>My view is perhaps the opposite, sort of...</p>
<p>I think there may well be merit in the argument, that the jabbed will just automatically keep firing the same bullets that don't work. That's a discussion over my head. On a more basic level my concern is 'leaky vaccine syndrome'.</p>
<p>That means when you subject the virus to pressure from vaccines it will attempt to get past them (via selection, no actual thought involved). The vaccines are "leaky" in that they just reduce the symptoms which reduces both transmission and infection without actually stopping either of them.</p>
<p>The result is more dangerous variants can develop and spread, because why not? With reduced symptoms people will still socialize and work, go shopping etc. But when these variants hit those WITHOUT any vaccine then some of the variants could be extremely dangerous for them.</p>
<p>We could see the same as in the past when Europeans arrived somewhere far, far away and killed huge numbers of locals who had no resistance to the germs they bought. We're literally doing the same thing, giving people vaccines to reduce symptoms and then (allegedly) we're going to let THOSE people travel?</p>
<p>While normal people, who would stay at home if they were sick, we're going to stop those normal people from travelling? Like everything else with this, it's totally fucking backwards.</p>

        <p>This is what I have been saying... the vaxed are going to have to keep getting jabbed or die...  Like a drug dealer giving the first hit away for free, big pharma now has these people dependent for life.  Funded by our tax money, the first couple doses were "free" and now all these vaxed folks are going to have to pay $$$ every six months (now they are saying monthly!) to keep themselves alive.</p>
<p>There is no money in cures, but there is a ton of money in life long "therapies".  And all these politicians / msm / doctors, etc. that have been complicit in getting people jabbed are all in big pharma's pocket.  I would be interested if anyone is getting huge kickbacks from all this.</p>

        <p>This is a well-known phenomenon and officially called:</p>
<p>"The original antigenic sin"</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_antigenic_sin</p>
<p>Your description of this is spot on. The narrower the spectrum of inoculation, the narrower the response and the more helpless the immune system will be against different strains. That's why the older vaccines produced far better and far broader responses, because manufacturing was worse, hence the antigens had more small differences.</p>
<p>Two questions: what happens to a monoculture of crops that are all genetically exactly alike when a predator meets them? </p>
<p>What will happen now if the entire planet is vaccinated against one and only one strain with a terribly narrow variance and nature will confront them with a strain that can evade one, and therefore evade all the immune systems?</p>

        <p>See I still don't think that it is any sort of vaccine in the shots. I don't think its a weakened virus. I never did. There has apparently been some question as to whether it was ever even isolated. If it hasn't been isolated, how could it have been made in a lab? Or only the WIV has it? Etc. Etc. So many contradictions that there's nothing you can believe at face value.</p>
<p>Some people say it does actually have a weakened virus or spike protein in it causing cytokine storms. That's what's causing the auto immune issues. A group of researchers out of South America(?) Had it tested and proclaim that its full of graphene oxide, which could potentially cause all the side effects.</p>
<p>But graphene oxide can be naturally expelled from the body. So that's why you need a booster. Or you need a booster for the reasons OP states.</p>
<p>Like I believe you and your doctor friend, or at least believe that that is what you believe, but this is ALL completely screwed up. Knowing that, we do the best with the info we have. Thanks for sharing info. It all boils down to what's actually in it.</p>

        <p>That’s what I’ve been telling everyone. I’m not anti vaccine for vaccines that have existed for decades and have millions of dollars and years of research poured into them like the meningitis vaccine or Measles vaccine which only need to be used once and you’ve built immunity for it, However in regards to the Covid vaccine, which isn’t even FDA approved, it’s experimental and clinical trials end in 3-5 years, it’s something I highly advise against. Especially considering we have an immune system for the very reason of fighting against viruses/common colds. Once we build reliance of vaccines, we can only expect a further decline in natural health. It’s sad that I don’t see doctors advising basic remedies like exercises, weight loss, and the consumption of healthy foods. Rather than incentivizing an experimental vaccine with unhealthy foods and alcohol. The world really is upside down nowadays.</p>

<p>That's for boosting vitamin C to stave off scurvy, it's an old wilderness survival trick and it tastes like ass.  Also, if you're starving you can eat the soft inner bark of most pines and spruce, it tastes like double ass but it'll keep you alive.</p>
<p>It's something they used to teach in school(at least here in Canada) prior to the 00's, especially in rural and rural-urban areas where the landlines of civilization could be easily cut off.</p>

        <p>I havent seen it written up, but I have heard that it will camouflage the virus from your immune system and, thus, your immune system wont respond.  They did not mention that the boosters would be effective in combatting the latest strains.</p>
<p>My understanding is that most people who think long this line, think the vaccine is pretty useless versus the virus.</p>

What is more likely going to happen is that the epitope is mutating (when they said the spike protein was stable and wouldn’t mutate) so it just isn’t triggering an immune response at all.  There are some concerns about ADE but we don’t have much evidence of that, yet at least.</p>

        <p>I agree with you on this. Every globalist loves a good subscriber model to basically extract more money out of you for work that has already been done, that you have already paid for. </p>
<p>I think that the vaccines and the fascist structure rising up around them are a subscriber model for 'life' and 'society'.</p>

        <p>Do you think this was done on purpose? I'm confused as to why the powers that be would want to kill off the gullible and easily manipulated leaving only those that disagree, dislike, and disavow everything they say. It seems more likely that they would want to save the population that will do whatever they are told and kill off the nay sayers.</p>

        <p>Doesn't make any sense what so ever.   The J&amp;J vaccine was dead or weakened Covid-19, basically a traditional  vaccine. </p>
<p>the M-RNA   was essentially a partial virus.   it went into some of your cells and took over their DNA replication process and forced your cells to create partial viruses ,  the spike protein parts. and your body makes T-cells and White blood cells to kill it. </p>
<p>There's nothing about that process  that would completely turn off your immune system. </p>
<p>Name the doctor or link a source.   this is like all the fake news about trump from "anonymous sources said" </p>
<p>If your under 50,  with out being obese, diabetic, or having lung issues I'd say skip the vaccine, but not because of your BS reason.  </p>
<p>This is B.S.    The reason some vaccinated are dying is that they are obese, with a lot of other health issues and instead of working on their health they ate more and didn't exercise at all.</p>

        <p>If they isolated the virus, why would they not use dead parts of the virus to create the vaccines? Instead they opted for an experimental mRNA solution which codes the sequence of the viral spike protein so that your cells create an artificial spike instead. Sounds to me like they did this because they didn't have an isolated virus available.</p>
<p>Just because they have the sequence doesn't mean they have isolated the virus. The fact that Reuters fact checks exist on this topic suggest to me that they have not in fact isolated the virus.</p>
<p>At this point I find it difficult to verify.</p>

<p>The chickenpox vaccine for example is actual living chickenpox Virus that's been weakened,  like they heat it to where it almost dies and then bring the temp back down.</p>

<p>Scientists have separated the virus from other organic matter and looked at it under microscope.  <br>
I have the feeling we are using that term differently.<br>

        <p>All of the vaccines work in the same way.  They take genetic material in to your cells and get your cells to create the spike protein.  The Phizer/Moderna vaccines use lipid nanoparticle shells to carry the genetic material in to your cells, and the Astrazenica/J&amp;J  use adenovirus vectors, and so they will have some unique problems depending on which vector type they use, but the problems with the spike protein will be the same across all.  This includes the narrowly focussed immunity being discussed here</p>

        <p>Yes, but actually No.    2 of the vaccines are inactive viruses ,  and 2 are Mrna.       The inactive  virus  comes in contact with your immune system (T-cells and White blood cells) that create anti bodies to fight it and viola you have some resistance to it. </p>
<p>the MRNA style  has RNA that is delivered into some of your cells, your cells create proteins , then your immune system reacts to those , creates anti-bodies and viola  , resistance. </p>
<p>Neither case would explain why a slight mutation in the strain is going to cause death for those who got the vaccine,  but those who avoided the vaccine will be fine.</p>

<li>Viral evolution toward more contagiousness and less lethality, when it happens is a change to the virus - and has nothing to do with the nature of the person getting it.</li>
<li>Vaccination doesn't affect the immune systems response to other antigens.  (If it worked the way OP is implying, any vaccination would trigger this for everything.)</li>
<li>No other vaccination works the way that OP is implying.  For example, the flu vaccine prevents about 60% of flu cases, but those who are vaccinated again the flu but get it anyway don't all die (and are less likely to die than those who are not vaccinated.)</li>

        <p>Unfortunately the censorship is so rampant the majority of doctors cannot say much of anything if it is against the narrative right? That should make sense to you otherwise they will lose their livelihood. My doctor has also explained to me since I am a healthy individual NOT to take part in this experimental injection as he is not. If your doctor explained this to you, would you believe them and look at the actual science or are you just so lib brainwashed that CNN and CDC/WHO are the only things you trust</p>

        <p>Mine also did the same. If your doctor tried to explain actual science to you, would you be resistant and only trust the TV?</p>
