    <strong>What even is the point anymore? They already won lol</strong>
    <p><p>Just a discussion post but what even is the point anymore? I remember a year ago when this covid bs started and I was the first one who thought it was something super serious and on the same level as the Spanish flu so I started saving up canned food and got my flu shot. I remember when I got the flu shot everyone in my family thought I was crazy and my mom, was especially the one who called me out on it (everyone in my family has the pfizer shot now). Now that I have discovered that the virus has only killed 26 people in my province in my age group 20-29 (since Jan 2020) link:<a href="https://covid-19.ontario.ca/data">https://covid-19.ontario.ca/data</a> (im 22 and healthy af) I seriously don't know why I should get a Vaccine which was barely in development for a year, not even FDA approved and no long term affects have been yet to discover. But basically, you are legit considered Hitler if you don't get the vaccine. More people in that age group died from suicide or drug overdose but you know, that doesn't put fear in peoples heart so lets not talk about that. People wont be friends with you, potential relationships tend to go extinct depending on your vaccine status and you are not welcome in many places depending on your vaccine status and what you believe in related to Covid.</p>
<p>What i have learned in this pandemic though is that</p>
<ol>
<li>Scientists and people in medicine are basically gods and prophets, you cannot argue and question them at all otherwise you are either a dumb ass  or stupid. Science is basically the new religion.</li>
<li>Media is extremely powerful and most people don't wish to think for themselves. Instead of getting their story from two independent sources and figuring out bias from each one, they would rather see something go along with what they believe in (confirmation bias)</li>
<li>If you say anything against covid or vaccines you are automatically a right wing nazi trump supporter (im brown lol)</li>
<li>For someone who works in the banking sector and is a business student the economic crisis that is currently looming and the amount of money that was printed in March of last year should be a MAJOR concern. I cannot stress this enough how fked our country is, we had a national deficit of 354 billion for 2020-2021.</li>
<li>CBC, CNN, The Washington post, CTV, Reddit, Twitter= Liberal                                                            ; Fox News, Facebook, The daily wire= Conservative                                                                                               All made to create a division between races  not realizing that the true enemy are the rich, the corrupt politicians and the elites.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ps. I think ima get my vaccine cuz its pointless, when the cases start going up in October the non vaccines people are going to be blamed and shit is gonna go bad. Imagine every single news outlet blaming the non vaccine people for the outbreak, lol like RIP.</p></p>

        <p>Dude it‚Äôs not hopeless, there‚Äôs way more reasonable people out there than you think. If you just look at social media you‚Äôre going to think everyone is a fear mongering bastard but in real life people tend to have much more reasonable opinions. Most of my friends are skeptical even the ones in health care at this point. The pendulum will swing back in some time but it‚Äôs gonna be messy for sure. Stand your ground man</p>

        <p>All the more reason not to get it! That‚Äôs the problem, every person giving in is another brick in the wall of their prison they‚Äôre creating for us!</p>
<p>Besides, everyone surrendering their body to be penetrated by the State will only have to surrender to further shots which, I am 100% convinced now, will kill you.</p>

        <p>I pretty much agree with you that there is some malevolence with these vaccines but im curious as to what made you so sure they are designed to kill us. Yes there has been an increasingly high number of VAERS cases caused because of these vaccines (some estimates up to 50,000 in the US alone), but considering that hundreds of millions of people have already got vaxxed around the world, in your opinion what made you 100% convinced? Genuinely curious as to other peoples reasoning.</p>

        <p>I think the first two shots have been a mix of placebo and mRNA, either one or the other or both. We have yet to see the effects of Antibody Dependancy Enhancement with upcoming flu seasons. I am beginning to understand the mechanisms involved. The info is out there.</p>
<p>Further the clotting issues. This is only going to get worse as the placebo to mRNA injection ratios get slimmer and disappear. Of course I‚Äôd love to be proved wrong here, but absolutely nada about this whole agenda is good, only evil and destructive.</p>

        <p>I finally walked away from the Democrats, in disgust 8-9 years ago.
<em>Forever Independent</em></p>
<p>I realized what they had become and I had been disillusioned with the lies, deceit and hypocrisy for DECADES.</p>
<p>I think it‚Äôs harder for those who are FINALLY seeing with the glasses on. ‚ÄúThey Live‚Äù  üï∂ </p>
<p>It‚Äôs on full display now, they can‚Äôt hide this or easily cover it up.  Of course they are all in this together.
They‚Äôre one big team, it‚Äôs been obvious for years and years.</p>
<p>If you start to examine and pull back the layers, you‚Äôll see many things have been rotten in Denmark for many, many, many years.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll never accept this.
This battle is even bigger than what they are currently trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>Did you vote for this horrific totalitarian fascist government?</p>
<p>Joe Biden is the worst President of my lifetime.</p>
<p>Many here voted for this!  Imagine that?</p>

        <p>Unfortunately you are right, they have won. And it's because there's far too many stupid people who have allowed them too and they still exist In mass.</p>
<p>Let's play smart here, let them push it, take their jab, let all those sheep see what happens when this goes too far. Then eventually, hopefully they will fight back with us.</p>
<p>For now, in my country at least, it's futile. Fighting the passports is just a waste of energy since 90% have already took it, support it or just don't care enough to speak out against it.</p>
