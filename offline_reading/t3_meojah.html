    <strong>I don't know how much longer I can go on</strong>
    <p><p>It really just feels like there is no end to this. The news and the government clearly want to find any kind of new Covid variant to scare us. Everyone I know has masked up, complied and did everything they were told to do.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I've not been able to see a friend, go somewhere public without a mask or tell someone how I am really feeling. I only tell people a portion of what I am feeling because I know how they will react to how I truly feel about the restrictions. My state is going to be one of those states that is either the last to reopen or close to it. Even when they reopen apparently businesses can still require you to wear a mask and distance. Yet my life and my feelings are invalid because if I want to take care of myself mentally it would apparently be selfish by putting others at risk. At least according to the CDC and Fraudci.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I really have lost myself during this whole thing. I spent a year complying and all what it did was destroy my mental health. Yet because I was a good sheep and complied I will have people telling me I did a great job. How is it great when I wake up and tell myself I don't want to be here anymore? Due to the fact I potentially kept someone safe for isolating and not spreading my germs at a local store where someone could have came in contact with those same germs from me and died.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Normally I would rant on other subreddits that deal with more mental stuff. In this case though I have found out that even in subreddits that deal with depression and mental health they will either ban or take your posts down if you say the restrictions caused you to have mental problems. It's sad they don't recognize what the restrictions are doing to people and instead call you an "anti masker".  Everyday I just wake up and wish for things to be over. I fear the government has it's hold on the people so much that they are going to accept the restrictions as part of our lives going forward.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>We have lost so much already. We lost some lives to covid, but we also lose a lot of lives due to suicide. It's increased so much during the pandemic yet all what people really care about is Covid cases. Yet we are monsters for wanting a normal life so people can live a happier life. I refuse to accept suicide as I want to live a happy life with my girlfriend and marry her at some point. However the longer this has been going on the more I just want to escape...</p></p>
