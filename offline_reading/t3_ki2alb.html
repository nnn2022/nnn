    <strong>Repeated use of the phrase “Dark Winter”</strong>
    <p><p>Another Redditor recently posted about the “Dark Winter” bioterror preparedness program that happened back in 2001 and simulated a pandemic. This post is not about that program, but about how that exact phrase “Dark Winter” is suddenly ubiquitous in the media.</p>
<p>I encourage you all to look up how frequently this term is being used. It’s quite stunning. Some would point to Joe Biden’s use of this phrase in a debate. However, I’ve set forth below a list of examples of the recent use of this phrase that go far beyond Biden’s reference. I could have literally listed dozens more. </p>
<p>Like “Build Back Better”, this suddenly emerged as a ubiquitous phrase.</p>
<p>Of course, repeating a phrase incessantly is classic brainwashing. </p>
<p>Any thoughts on the “Dark Winter”? What are they preparing us for?</p>

        <p>I do believe these things will happen in time, but not as quickly as we think.  All the globalist plans roll out slowly and they tell us if you watch carefully. This slow roll allows for the absorption and intergration over time. This coming decade will be the most important to be a part of, but it is just starting, and they don't need to rush to break us because it's already happening at its own pace. </p>
<p>I have friends like many in this sub who were hard core truthers who are throwing in the towel because they want things to go back to the way they were, they'll take the vaccine if it means they can hug their parents.  I try to tell them the tyranny won't end because you get poked.. but then they begin to blame the anti maskers for making this cold virus continue.. I have lost them and they see me as the enemy now.. again, they are slowly breaking us, they don't need to expedite anything.</p>

        <p>I think that is an accurate assessment indeed!</p>
<p>Yes some are breaking, I'm sorry about your friends. And some are waking.</p>
<p>I have the sense, there is something coming, a rogue element if you will, that might shake things up in our favour.</p>
<p>But yes, the next decade could be very challenging 😕</p>

        <p>I broke the other way around. Believed in this bullshit for months. I wouldn't consider myself a <em>full-on</em> antimasker, and I definitely wasn't at all in the beginning. I was concerned with the negative effects of quarantine (domestic violence, child rape, and starvation have all risen rapidly) but I still thought that, if there wasn't a choice, then at least the quarantine would solve the virus issue. But I realize how the government is playing us now.</p>

        <p>I think ‘dark winter’ with all the cyber attack propaganda, it’s a clear message that there will be mass power outages. Why exactly, only the upper echelon know..</p>
<p>My guess is more panic, more destruction, more confusion, more misdirection.</p>
<p>Blame the Russians or whatever other ‘enemy’ they want to start a cyber war with. Also, if people can’t communicate over the internet, it will be much harder to communicate and share information of what’s going on.</p>
<p>But honestly who knows, maybe nothing will happen, and it will just be shit miserable winter like the past year. </p>
<p>Either way, it’s going to be shit. That’s a given.</p>

        <p>At CyberPolygon in July, Klaus Schwab warns that a comprehensive cyber attack will bring a complete halt to the power supply, transportation, hospitals.
He says covid 19 will pale in comparison</p>
<p>A bit suspicious considering the recent news of a massive and comprehensive cyberattack against the US government, which the MSM is increasingly pinning on Russia.</p>
<p>This is what I believe the Dark Winter is.</p>

        <p>I was really worried about this, but I think it would have happened by now if it was going to. I might be wrong, but we just passed the darkest day in the Northern hemisphere and the planetary conjunction that the conspiracy people were all worried about (I’m not dissing on them btw, I’m kinda one of them lol) and nothing happened. The internet and power grid didn’t go down.</p>
