    <strong>Noticed a pattern in studies testing oxygen levels and mask wearing</strong>
    <p><p>After seeing some vids of people passing out whilst wearing a mask some Youtuber doing exercises whilst wearing a mask and having his oxygen levels monitored. I decided to look up some studies that say there are no issues with wearing a mask and oxygen levels. Guess what pattern I saw?</p>
<p>All these tests are done over very, very short periods time with only a few participants. So yeah, if someone tells you masks don't interfere with oxygen uptake they might refer to studies that have tested this for 5-10 minutes only.</p>
<p>I've not found a single study that has tested oxygen levels for longer periods of time. Many people that work in retail or an office wear a mask 6-8 hours per day with a few breaks only.</p>
<p>I don't wanna assume malice but when all these studies only test oxygen levels less than hour with a very small number of participants I tend to not take those results very seriously.</p></p>

        <p>I had to renew my OSHA certification late summer 2019. They spent over an hour about “loose fitting face masks”. They do nothing more than give a false sense of security. Silica is/was going to be the new crisis. Their studies (they never told the details of their study. As far as timeframes and methods) showed you’re more at risk of hypoxia and the mask does nothing to prevent silica from cut/drilled concrete dust entering your lungs. Not even n95. They required a pulmonary function test and a tight fitting face mask to even be in the same building as someone drilling or cutting concrete. You can see a silica particle btw. </p>
<p>Maybe you could look into OSHA medical studies on loose fitting face masks. I think it’s mostly public info.</p>

        <p><strong>American Journal of Infection Control:</strong></p>
<p>“Wearing an N95 for an entire 12-hour shift had statistically significant negative effects on some physiologic measures and subjective symptoms. Over time, nurses’ CO2 levels became significantly elevated, from a statistical standpoint, compared with beginning-of-shift baseline measures; perceived exertion; perceived shortness of air; and complaints of headache, lightheadedness, and difficulty communicating also increased over time. CO2 levels increased from a baseline average of 32.4 at the beginning of the shift to 41.0 at the end of each shift [26.5% increase].”</p>
<p>“Wearing an N95 with surgical mask overlay had statistically significant negative effects over and above those associated with wearing only an N95. CO2 levels, nausea, and complaints of visual challenges increased significantly more when nurses were wearing the N95 and mask than when only wearing an N95.”</p>
