    <strong>Why wouldn't you wear a mask?</strong>
    <p><p>I am just curious, why wouldn't you wear a mask?</p>
<p>Wouldn't you want to have that safeguard just in case COVID is a threat? Little is known of the long term effects of COVID, so why would you want to put that to chance? Plus, wearing a mask is a very simple, easy thing to do. It takes very little effort to protect yourself and others. Best case scenario, your mask protects you from COVID, worst case scenario, you wear a mask for no reason. I'm afraid I just don't understand, the positives of wearing a mask outweigh the negatives.</p>
<p>Plus, wearing masks has been proven to protect others around you, not just yourself. I feel like you would want to show people the proper respect for their health and safety, regardless of the severity of the disease. Maybe COVID isn't dangerous to you or them, but maybe that person has contact with someone is is numerable, and you not wearing a mask has put them at risk. </p>
<p>I also don't understand the arguments of masks being suppressive and dehumanizing. The mask does not inhibit your ability to communicate, breathe, or think. It is a minor inconvenience at worst, and wearing it is, again, a health precaution.  It's like saying a seatbelt is a submissive device that suppresses the human spirit.  The only difference is that if you don't wear a seatbelt, it's only your life that gets affected, when if you don't wear a mask, it's other people that may have to bear the consequences for your decision.</p>
<p>I was hoping someone could shed some light on this, and tell me why I am wrong. Civil discourse only please.</p></p>

        <p>If that is so, then how do they differ? You aren't adding anything relevant to the conversation,  you're not giving me any reasoning. BTW, I am not left leaning, I consider myself a moderate. That shouldn't be important to anyone, but apparently it is.</p>

        <p>Sweden's population density is much less that the United State's. COVID spreads very quickly through high density areas, so it makes sense that Sweden has less COVID deaths.</p>
<p>Let's also not forget that the proportion of deaths to population in Sweden is much higher compared to other European countries, and the United States. Plus, Sweden has universal healthcare, and statistically, less people have underlying conditions that can lead to complications if COVID is contracted.</p>
<p>Here is a small article explaining this:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/heres-what-happened-in-sweden-and-you-cant-compare-it-to-u-s#Can-Swedens-approach-work-in-the-U.S.?">https://www.healthline.com/health-news/heres-what-happened-in-sweden-and-you-cant-compare-it-to-u-s#Can-Swedens-approach-work-in-the-U.S.?</a></p>
<p>Comparing Sweden to the United States is like comparing a rural farm with a city, it just doesn't make sense. Have any other facts/reasoning? I would be curious to hear more.</p>

        <p>I posted this article in a previous response, but here you go:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/06/11/fact-check-n-95-filters-not-too-large-stop-covid-19-particles/5343537002/">https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/06/11/fact-check-n-95-filters-not-too-large-stop-covid-19-particles/5343537002/</a></p>
<p>To summarize, virus particles are almost never floating aimlessly, they are almost always attached to other particles that are big enough to get caught in the mask. Plus, viruses particles have a very erratic movement pattern, meaning that they would get consistency caught by the mask, even if they were free floating, and not attached to other larger particles.</p>
<p>COVID is not special in this regard, other viruses follow these same rules, which is why masks are(and have been) used in the medical industry for decades, as they significantly lower the chances of ANY foreign biological material from escaping.</p>
<p>Plus, their is a standard. The name of the N95 mask denotes that the mask can constantly block 95% of foreign biological material. Most masks also follow this naming convention.</p>
<p>N95 masks or not, viruses follow the same rules regardless of the blocking material. One thing is clear, while other methods of blocking particles may not be as effective as others, most blocking materials significantly lower the risk of transmission. It is certainty better than nothing. </p>
<p>I have yet to be convinced, some sources would help your case. If you have any more insight I would be more than happy to hear it.</p>

        <p>'genuinely curious' You bots need to improve yourselves, repetitive language gives you away.  Changes havent occured these last months, Covid isnt special, Covid hasnt changed, cloth or even other kinds of masks did not become magic this year. And on top of that data on outcomes clearly shows they have no effect</p>

<p>Also, correct me if I am wrong, but isn't asking questions the entire point of not just this sub-reddit, but reddit in general? Perhaps I am getting too meta with my argument, but it is a question I am asking just the same.</p>

        <p>Yes, you are sooooo meta. I will say again to you, you cant read, all you want is for Fauci or NYT to tell you what to think, and no they did not and will not ever say the things you want me to prove, therefore to you it is not 'proof'. Go and look at sites that have the data, country by country. Look. See. Think. It'll hurt, but eventually you'll kick one of your tiny brain cells into gear, and half of one is all you'll need. But you wont because thats not why your here.</p>

        <p>Pal, I'm so sorry for you, but there are literally thousands of studies before this that show masks do not work. This is your game you can go play it by yourself. Nothing has changed, the virus has not changed size, (got yourselves your own conspiracy theory there eh?) masks are not suddenly made of magic, its the same type of masks and the same cloth. Data shows no increased deaths in places that had no mask use</p>

        <p>I simply cannot breathe properly in a mask.  You going to call me an ambulance if I pass out?  Doubt it.   End of story.  They have not been proven to be effective.  The air you exhale is exhaled out the front and sides of a mask.  Unless you have a military grade mustard gas mask you are not protectied from coronavirus.</p>

        <p>So here is my understanding:</p>
<p>Vape particles are smaller than COVID(Or any virus particles for that matter). Therefore, it is completely reasonable for water vapor to escape masks, the virus particles are caught in the mask and are not released into the environment. </p>
<p>Here is some more info on this, specially on N95 masks:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/06/11/fact-check-n-95-filters-not-too-large-stop-covid-19-particles/5343537002/">https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/06/11/fact-check-n-95-filters-not-too-large-stop-covid-19-particles/5343537002/</a></p>
<p>Plus, the man in the video is using the masks incorrectly. It is not tight around his face, and has many openings. Perhaps that is a stretch,  but I think it is important to point out.</p>
<p>I don't think testing if 'Vape Aerosols' can escape masks are an accurate way of determining if masks can block pathogens. Do you have any other sources you want me to look at? I'd be curious to see them.</p>
<p>They key to masks being effective is using them correctly. Using them correctly is key.</p>
<p>Plus, I doubt that you have problems breathing in them. No studies have shown that this is the case, I can provide sources if you want. Perhaps you shouldn't be out and about if your respiratory system is compromised, as it may be more susceptible to COVID.</p>

        <p>I appreciate your argument and believe you are absolutely correct that they can collect water vapour.  I disagree that the masks I see people are wearing are being worn properly and are airtight by any means.<br>
Personally, I have an issue breathing in them when worn properly and you could show me 800 studies to the contrary.</p>

        <p>That is your personal experience, and that is fair and valid, masks can be uncomfortable for some. I just ask that you distance yourself from others if you are not comfortable with mask wearing.  </p>
<p>And yes, masks are often worn improperly, that much is true. It still reduces the risk of COVID transmission, so where is the problem? A condom worn incorrectly still provides better protection than nothing(This analogy is a stretch, I know).</p>
<p>Again, it's hard to argue with personal experiences. I only ask that you don't potentially put other people at risk(Not implying that you have any infections diseases, including COVID).</p>

        <p>I have to wear a mask at work and at times where I believe I need to(transit, grocery stores, and in contested public areas)and  I am following all the protocols including social distancing.  If I had flu like symptoms, then I have no problem wearing a mask  Even though I remove my mask when it makes sense to me,  I am cognisant that someone in my vicinity may be diabetic or have a immune disorder.  I have had many colds before and can say with confidence that the harshest environment for catching them is on packed public transit full of sick people.<br>
I will not wear a mask when alone in a park, while driving or when I am not around anyone.
I hate wearing them and I am not anti vax for things like hep, measles, etc. but againt the fear and the mask being conditioning to get the covid vacinne.  I am not interested in the covid vacinne at all.</p>

        <p>In my opinion, I think your outlook is completely valid. I do not think wearing a mask is necessary when you are alone outside or driving, I think that is overkill. I also understand the discomfort, I think most people find masks to be uncomfortable, myself included.</p>
<p>My understanding of the COVID vaccine is very limited, although I would say that I would not want to receive it until it has undergone the rigorous testing that other vaccines must undergo. At that point, it would be just as safe as every other vaccine.</p>
<p>Could you shed some more light on mask conditioning for me? What is the purpose? How would a powerful entity(Government, corporations, ect.) benefit from mask conditioning?</p>

        <p>Because first it’s the mask, then it’s mandatory, then it’s the vaccine, then it’s the mandatory digital health passport, the it’s the vaccine boosters 4x/year “for your safety”, the it’s the don’t leave your house until the light is green.</p>
<p>I don’t know if you are noticing this but there isn’t an end to it. It all starts with the mask.</p>

        <p>I simply don't see the correlation between public safety government suppression. What you are saying is completely valid, without proper checks this pandemic could potentially act as a method for the government to suppress the people.</p>
<p>But I do not see how masks can lead to this outcome, and I think this outcome is unlikely. I also don't think that masks will be the straw that breaks the camel's back when it comes to human rights, although that is just my opinion.</p>
<p>If you have any more insight on this matter I would be curious to hear about it.</p>

        <p>All right, I'll bite. Your entire argument rests on the premise that most of what you've heard in the news is accurate or if not, then it's an honest mistake. This isn't true. Covid is just the same seasonal cold the world has been living through just fine for thousands of years. Maybe a little wheezier in this round. It only got a fancy scary name and a global crisis because the news is deliberately selling it to you that way.
 Which is to say every argument for or against the mask stuff that tries to build its logic on viral particles and invisible carriers and whatnot is missing the point. You were lied to from the beginning. Those frightening 6 figure death tolls have already been admitted in published reports to be absolute nonsense conjured up by running a notoriously inconclusive viral test on the corpses of people who died from numerous other causes. Doctors and nurses have admitted being offered kickbacks to over report infections and deaths.
All this information is out there if you look past all the crap and controlled opposition (does anyone REALLY think covid was engineered by the lizard men to hide the ill effects of 5g cell towers? Absolutely not).
When someone drops by to say masks are for morons, what they mean in short is, you've clearly drunk the koolaid before posting and we can't enlighten you unless you spit it out. Also we still aren't wearing the damn mask.</p>

        <p>For me, it comes down to not at all being afraid of this virus, and believing that if someone is that terrified of this (weak as fuck) virus, then they can feel free to stay home and/or take all the precautions necessary to make them feel safe, as opposed to them or government forcing everyone in their city/state/country to wear them.</p>
<p>And it's not like I never wear one. I'm asked to for work, so I do. If an employee of a business I'm in asks me to wear a mask, I'll put one on as to not be a bother and cause an issue.</p>
<p>&rt;but maybe that person has contact with someone is is numerable, and you not wearing a mask has put them at risk. </p>
<p><em>maybe</em>. This entire pandemic is essentially built on a "maybe", and that's probably what annoys me most. If a person has contact with someone vulnerable, then that person needs to take that personal responsibility of doing what they can to keep that vulnerable person safe. In addition, that vulnerable person needs to also take personal responsibility for themselves and keep safe (assuming they're even concerned about the virus in the first place).</p>
<p>&rt;The mask does not inhibit your ability to communicate, breathe, or think. </p>
<p>As a bartender, I highly beg to differ.</p>
<p>As far as your seatbelt example, I don't think you can equate them to masks. As far as a practical examle, if I do wear a seatbelt happen to get into a crash, I likely won't die or be severly injured. If I don't wear a seatbelt and happen get into a crash, I'll likely die or get severly injured. Regardless if I wear a mask or not, if I happen to catch the virus, the odds are heavily in my favor that I won't die or be severaly injured. Or be anything other than minorly inconvenienced. So if this virus was cancer spreading through the air (like many people seem to think it is), then yeah, I'd wear a mask. I'd also stay the hell home though. Seatbelts and masks in general just aren't the same things and are used in totally different ways.</p>
<p>Speaking of seatbelts, there are a ton of people who die from car-related incidents, yet no one ever seems concerned about driving a car. You have a way higher chance of being harmed by going to the store to pick up a massive jug of hand sanitizer than you do of catching this virus and being even midly harmed from it. So can we lower the speed limit to 15mph to lower the chances of car-related deaths? And/or limit the amount of cars on the road in order to cater to those who are terrified of driving?</p>

        <p>Now take that number and multiply by 6%, which is the number of deaths from COVID. I believe you are talking about deaths with COVID, like the 88 year old with heart and renal failure, afib, diabetes, and Parkinson's. Cause of death? COVID. Sure it is. Or the completely made up deaths like the guy who died in a motorcycle accident.</p>
<p>If I were on death's door, I might have reason to be concerned, but I might have reason to be concerned about all the things putting me there in the first place. I'm more afraid of the flu than I am of COVID because it has a greater likelihood of killing me. To be clear, I am not at all afraid of the flu. Life has risk. This is just another one, and not at all special. As pandemics go, it is a bottom tier one, barely worthy of taking any precautions, per the CDC's own (pre-2020) guidelines. Certainly not wearing masks, which they didn't even mention at all because it was universally agreed they did not help.</p>
<p>Yet what is the largest age group increase for excess deaths? 25-44. Why? Not COVID. Lockdown. Suicide, homicide, overdoses. Our response to this has been catastrophic and will harm society for generations.</p>
<p>Long COVID? Not a serious talking point. It has been 8 months. That is not long-term.</p>

        <p>I like to go up to random strangers, sniff their hair, then put it in my mouth. Masks prohibit me from living my truth as a hair sniffer/ snacker.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, put some effort into reading older posts/ comments in this sub before asking the same damn question so many others are asking, along with the repetitive rhetorical propaganda.</p>

        <p>I am deeply sorry that masks prevent you from living your dream. My heart weeps for you, oh lost soul in the night.</p>
<p>To address your comment, I have read some of the other posts, and I figured it would be insightful to ask my own question. I also find replying and interacting to users on my own post is easier, at least for me.</p>

        <p>Why should I have to pay if someone had a bad diet along with smoking or drug use that caused them to be more susceptible and I have to wear a mask to protect them??. Another reason, no one ever asked what the older population wanted, did they really want economic collapse, a country more divided then ever?, increased suicides in young people? In exchange for them staying at home all day. My 3rd reason, masks can create a snowball effect, first it's no mask no entry and just like that no vaccine no entry, seriously??</p>

        <p>I am just curious, why wouldn't you stop forcing your fear of coronavirus on to others?</p>
<p>Wouldn't you want to have lived life to
the fullest just in case early death from an accident or terminal cancer or murder? Little is known of the long term effects of mask wearing in everyday life, so why would you want to put that to chance? Plus, surviving coronavirus is a very simple, easy thing to do. It takes very little effort to stay healthy and improve your immune system through diet and exercise. Best case scenario, you have an amazing life full of enriching experiences and relationships, worst case scenario, you end up sick with a 99.6%+ chance of survival. I'm afraid I just don't understand, the positives of living life to the fullest outweigh the negatives.</p>
<p>Plus, minding your own business has been proven to maintain the peace and dignity of others around you, not just yourself. I feel like you would want to show people the proper respect for their bodily autonomy and privacy, regardless of the severity of the disease. Maybe not minding your own business isn't dangerous to you or them, but maybe that person has contact with someone who is a litigious sonnofabitch and you not giving them the benefit of the doubt has put them at risk for being avenged.</p>
<p>I also don't understand the arguments of coronavirus being worse than restructuring society to its detriment with no end date in sight. Not even long-term covid contributes to increases in child abuse, human trafficking, or global poverty and starvation the way coronavirus restrictions do. Coronavirus is a minor inconvenience for most, and improving your immune system through diet and exercise, is a health precaution. It's like saying a person making their own decisions is a subversive device that suppresses the human spirit. The only difference is that if you mind your own face, it's only your face that gets affected, when if you don't mind your own face, it's other people that may have to bare the bullshit coming out of your mouth.</p>
<p>I was hoping someone could shed some light on this, and tell me why I am wrong. Civil discourse only please.</p>
