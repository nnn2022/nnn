        <p>Man, I know the sentiment around here is more often than not "you get what you deserve"... but this is truly heartbreaking to read. I can feel this person's pain, suffering, and desperation vividly reading their posts.</p>
<p>Honestly, I've personally come to realize that, just like cancel and PC culture, the minority is loudest. The majority of everyday people haven't had the veil lifted and have been indoctrinated daily to never question authority and follow the rules. Everyone I know that has been vaccinated did so hesitantly and begrudgingly just to do 'their part' and because the government, media, our leaders, public figures, etc. have all been pushing this as the right thing to do and how well get back to normal.</p>
<p>I think we as a community in this subreddit need to practice more empathy towards our fellow peers. I get shitting on the kovidkarens but we need to focus on holding our governments and representatives accountable for the damage that is being done to our peers, neighbors, and families.</p>
<p>FUCK EVERY HEALTH ORGANIZATION, PUBLIC OFFICIAL, OR ANYONE WHO IS USING THEIR STATUS TO PUSH THIS UNIT 731 STYLE EXPERIMENT ON THE ENTIRE HUMAN RACE</p>

        <p>It's sad that our peers often than not look upon us with such disgust. My friend of 10 years parents told him he can only hang out with vaccinated people, his parents barred him from going out with me. I remember humble and fond moments having dinner at his house, his parents liked me too and were generous to me. I can't believe they devalued me into a non human (a dirty unvaccinated dangerous person) and pushed their son to blackball me. All this over a vaccine, we are the victims of these heartless mislead people, just as in Nazi Germany the masses are turning against people like us, ratting us out, banning us, acting like we're crazy (and this is just the beginning).</p>

        <p>Covid has shown people’s true colors. People who were always nice to me and I got along great with and would count as friends, suddenly condemning the unvaxxed and wishing death on them and calling them plague rats. Great way to advertise they have no mind of their own.</p>

        <p>Your friend's parents probably have reasons for not wanting to interact with you. Maybe there is someone with a compromised immune system whom they want to protect. You all play the victim so hard its exhausting. Nobody calls you a "dirty, unvaccinated dangerous person" but yourself. Lmao.</p>

        <p>I hold no anger/malice towards people who have been vaccinated. Only those in the government/positions of power who keep pushing the dam jab. Especially those who know better. It may be just a matter of time until the script is completely flipped and it's the vaccinated who will need our help and sympathy. They have been fooled and taken in by whatever atrocity this is. Everyday gives me hope that we are getting closer to that. Now they are considering health warnings but even better the word is getting out more and more about ivermectin. I think the people in charge of this mess just thought if they could scare us enough we'd all just line up and take it. Unfortunately the roll out took so long we all started seeing the results of it ourselves and changed our minds.</p>

        <p>Most of them do it with the illusion that they will get their freedoms back and get to travel. The truth is, most people (I would even say an overwhelming majority, like 80%) don't bother to get into the nitty gritty of the risks associated with covid (whether it be lockdowns, the statistics, the vaccine, or general info).</p>
<p>If I am in govt psyops, I would have perfected the public manipulation playbook by now. That's why it is so important that we need to be emphatic to those who unassumingly took the vaccine. </p>

        <p>hehe, this kinds of sums up humans and why all this can happen. We are capable of empathy when someone is obviously suffering and helpless, but when we feel they are being hostile toward us, we can't be empathetic. Their hostility is just another expression of pain, but we have to step aside from our own egos to see that.</p>

        <p>As you say, most folks getting vaccinated are doing what they think is the right thing. And most people - who choose not to get vaccinated - have friends and family members who have taken the shots.  I'd think most would not take a "serves you right" type of attitude towards those that got injured after being vaccinated.  It's not keeping me up nights, but I have loved ones that have taken this stuff and I worry from time to time about their health going forward.  It's just downright cruel to taunt someone who got really messed up because of taking any of these shots.</p>

        <p>I kinda flip back and forth on this. I really really want to be empathetic, but then I consider that these people have zero empathy for the millions who have suffered from lockdowns, the hundreds of thousands suffering vaccine side effects, etc.  You are right though, it isn't their fault, they've been completely brainwashed by authorities that, in a society that wasn't so rotten, we should all be able to trust.  They are victims just as we are. What a truly despicable and evil time we live in.</p>

        <p>No. This is war. And they've chosen their side. I have no empathy for strangers, friends, or even FAMILY that could quite possibly rat me out to the government if this fucking jab becomes mandatory and they know I haven't taken it. And trust me. They will make it mandatory. They're moving the Overton Window slowly, but surely.</p>
<p>We said this thing was man made in a lab. And we were called conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p>We said that people will die from the vaccine. And we were called conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p>We said that society will slowly start to segregate the vaxxed from the non-vaxxed. And we were called conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p>We said that they will introduce vaccine passports. And we were called conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p>We said that one day the government will have the vaxxed snitching on the non-vaxxed. And now Biden is asking for that.</p>
<p>Now we're saying that this shit will be mandatory one day like they're doing in the Philippines. And they're STILL calling us conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p>Fuck these people. Every time the things we say come true, they act like they knew all along. Fuck these pieces of shits.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately our fellow peers are part of the problem. Everyone who “begrudgingly” is getting vaccinated because they are being directed to, not because they want to, are forfeiting their birth right to body autonomy. Their concessions are the reason why the government is having a much easier time stripping us of our rights and freedoms while simultaneously conditioning people to think they’re “selfish” for having questions about a new vaccine and indoctrinating children.</p>

        <p>As a vaccine injured person I agree and the attitude of "you deserved it" because I trusted  mainstream medical advice is very demotivating. Many people who are advocates of better vaccine oversight and responsibility are vaccine injured or know someone who is vaccine injured. </p>
<p>Being told by one side that I deserved my illness, and being told I'm a liar or hypochondriac on the other is terrible, because what then? For what? I agree, obviously, that vaccines can be dangerous.</p>

There is a massive difference between getting short stints of sunlight, during certain times of the day, and before going out checking the UV index on your phone vs getting pissed and falling asleep outside. It’s always somebody else’s fault.</p>

<p>For me, I'm super light so I make sure I wear it at first, but gradually develop a tan, and then I can go without it and not get burnt. </p>
<p>But there are people who wear it all of the time and not get one ounce of sun.</p>

        <p>Vitamin D prevents sunburn. Either take supplements, or preferable eat organ meats. Raw liver and brain from grass fed animals are the best sources of vitamin D.</p>

        <p>I'd recommend (based on the recommendation of multiple doctors I've heard speak on the subject) 10,000 IU a day of a d3 gelcap as a minimum. Some recommend up to 50, 000IU a day for a short time to raise your levels quicker.
 Personally I do 20,000iu a day in winter and 10, 000 during summer since I go outside a good bit. My pregnant wife has been taking 20,000IU most days, doesn't get too much sun working an office job and her most recent blood test had her levels at 50 ng/ml. Which is a good number. We use the NOW foods 5,000iu gel caps you can get on Amazon for $11 a bottle.</p>

        <p>Vit. D3 is fat soluble so levels build up slowly over time. Toxicity happens from sustained high dose supplementation (like taking 50,000-100,000iu a day, and still months would be required to od), basically no single does can do it and if I remember correctly it's very rare. I believe only a handful of people have been actually been diagnosed with vitamin D toxicity ever. 
Obviously your best bet is to have your levels checked again after 3-6 months of taking Vit. D daily to make sure the one you are taking is working.
Chances are you won't overshoot and some doctors argue levels around 80 nm /dl are ideal anyways. </p>
<p>If you want more specific advice for you, I'd have you take 50,000IU a day for a week, and then 20,000 a day for two months at least. At which point you could stay there, or if you're worried about that dosage (I wouldn't be) you can then drop down to 10,000IU. Also give the 5000IU Now Foods brand on Amazon a try if you can. It's only $12 for the bottle and I know it works based on my wife's blood tests. </p>
<p>Just fyi the first symptom of Vit. D toxicity is persistent nausea that should easily clear up by discontinuing the supplement. I'd be shocked if you ever experience that though.</p>

        <p>Yep, I was suffering from a relapse into alcoholism back during the holidays and ended up getting COVID late November. I even drank vodka on the two evenings that the virus was at its worst. I was feeling pretty ill the first 2 nights; extreme fatigue, light fever... then just general malaise for a few days afterwards. In less than a week I was back to normal.</p>
<p>Tested positive for antibodies a month later.</p>
<p>One thing I've always done for years is take vitamin D, among other recommended supplements. I truly believe this is what made COVID so easy on me, despite my terrible health at the time due to heavy drinking. I honestly believed I'd be a goner if I got sick from it.</p>

        <p>Husband and I are both smokers. We…. Think… we might have had it initially last March, but hard to say, just seemed like a mild cold for me, and my husband has ridiculous seasonal allergies that always pop up at that time of year. Honestly we aren’t even super careful and basically never got sick, and not extremely sick for sure</p>

        <p>This might be the most terrifying one I’ve seen yet.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, my mom scaremongered so much about mad cow disease that I actually stopped eating beef for like 12 years and became a vegetarian for 7 years. </p>
<p>I’m not worried about it anymore and happily eat beef again (in fact it’s one of my favorite foods) but the thought of the vaccine causing anything similar is more than enough for me to avoid it.</p>

<p>You know what ended up being the cause of Mad Cow disease?</p>
<p>Cows who were exposed to phosmet, an insecticide against warble flies. It something which was added to the necks of the cattle and its MoA was to cause severe neural damage. It was used in Great Britain, Norther Ireland and Switzerland at such high concentrations and this is where almost all Mad Cow cases occurred. </p>
<p>If phosmet was officially declared as the cause of Mad Cow, then the compensation claims against the British government would be through the roof as well as against the meat supplier, and the insecticide maker.</p>

        <p>It was.  The UK allowed the use of brain matter as a protein supplement for cattle feed, until it was actually banned.  Within 3 years of testing cattle for BSE post-slaughter after banning that practice it wasn't found in animals anymore.  Phosmet was still in use until a few years ago until they discovered that it caused serious issues with bees, and was in use in Canada until the fall of 2020.  All the BSE cases in Canada were because of feed imported from the UK, that was contaminated with rendered brain in the feed as a supplement.</p>

        <p>the covid vaccine seems to be going the route that finasteride and SSRI's/benzo's have gone. they fuck people up badly with tons of side effects, but then doctors and medical experts have no idea exactly how to treat you or fix you. some even claiming "its all in your head".</p>

<p>The most common side effects are probably changes to menstrual cycles and chest pain. Lots of brain fog, headaches, nausea, vertigo and stuff like that too.</p>

        <p>Oh man...this sounds like prion disease (mad cow).  In the John Hopkins "SPARS Pandemic 2025 - 2027" document, they war-gamed what the country would most likely go through - especially as far as trying to communicate with the masses  - about a pandemic and the ensuing vaccines.  They outlined a scenario from the very beginnings of a world wide pandemic to the end wherein all kinds of people died after getting a new type of vaccine, and health/government types had to step down from their jobs, people suing the government, etc., etc.   One of the things the war-game scenario talked about was the vaccine causing prion disease in a certain segment of the population.  Ugh.  This is way beyond awful at this point.</p>

        <p>&rt;Can vaccines cause encephalopathy? While it’s a rare occurrence, vaccines are sometimes associated with encephalopathy. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program recognizes the MMR vaccine as a possible cause of encephalopathy. They also recognize vaccines used against pertussis such as the DTP or DTaP for this injury. Children are more likely than adults to develop this condition from a vaccine. When they do, they may have symptoms such as: Fever Seizures Muscle weakness Irritability Decreased attention span Headaches Fatigue General body pains If any of these symptoms appear, bring them immediately to a healthcare provider for evaluation and treatment. Symptoms are usually minor and don’t last long. However, in rare instances encephalopathy can be devastatingly severe and life-altering. Some children and adults with this condition require long-term care.</p>

        <p>Man these Vax testimonies are more terrifying than any horror movie, I can barely read something like this without feeling such tremendous dread in my soul I start to get nauseous. This is so sad, dude states he is basically getting CTE, which is what concussions cause in NFL Players with many head hits.

        <p>I’m keeping a folder of these screenshots. It’s crazy how many women have had insane period problems since getting vaccinated. Apparently some post menopausal women even got a period after getting vaccinated??? Madness 🤡</p>

        <p>So they gave you a botched jab job, and as a coping mechanism for the depression that gave you you are now taking antidepressants? Stop taking their poison!</p>
<p>As a cure the doctor wants to puncture your brain, even though nothing is visible on the scan? Stop listenen to and going to these quacks. They don't know anything and cannot solve health puzzles themselves, they will twist up your body's Rubik's cube a bit and leave you with the mess when they cannot get to into a better or the previous position.</p>

        <p>For the world's largest human experiment of all history, you would need (at the very minimum) three <strong>Control Groups</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>placebos (saline solutions)</li>
<li>weak dosages</li>
<li>full dosage</li>
</ul>
<p>And in 2022 they will start enforcing "top-ups", where a new variant will be shown as a threat, and we'll all have to take it. 
And the final finishing blow will be in 2023, where "three times the charm" mantra will kick in with another variant. </p>

        <p>The human body is incredibly complex and everyone's just a little bit different. Some feel nothing from the vaccine...a friend of mine didn't even feel the usual symptoms from the second dose and I felt like shit for two days. Others end up with serious complications. The actual virus swings both directions too - I've seen stories of healthy people ending up in the ICU on a ventilator while others get the sniffles or nothing at all.</p>
<p>As with any medicine it's important to weigh the risks. For some, the vaccine seems to do more harm than good and that choice should be respected. On the other hand, those who wish to take the vaccine anyway are to be too.</p>

        <p>Can anyone smarter than I please find that last commenter and let he/she know that Ivermectin works for "long Covid" syndrome? Any virus can cause long term exhaustion and fatigue, but all the panic porn doesn't help. Fatigue is also a symptom of depression...but taking Ivermectin at the very least takes care of the human body while healing, as does Vit D.</p>

        <p>Seriously, feeling sorry for those who feel terrible after vax because they naively thought that they were doing right thing and now regret it. Not feeling sorry for those who feel sick but still recommend to take it. Like, you cannot move because of some neurology symptoms but still think that it was a good decision? Saw a video from my country where a young man just did this. Bedridden for weeks but still pro covid vax. Just say that it was a mistake that will cost you a lot.  Misery loves company but it shouldn't be this way.</p>

        <p>This doesn't sound like Prion disease. This sounds like the rumor going around where someone got vaccinated and then said, "They've killed God. I can't feel God anymore. My soul is dead." It's reminiscent of that video of the guy talking about FunVax. You know the one where they kept saying it was Bill Gates so that other people could say it wasn't Bill Gates, and no one could focus on the actual topic at hand. The topic being that they've developed something that will kill the part of your brain that believes in God.</p>

        <p>You don't believe rigerous peer reviewed studies that show the vaccine is safe but if some random person behind a username online is saying that their brain is being eaten away, it has to be true. Like cmon, even a 5 year old could tell that this is 100% bs.</p>

        <p>Studies that followed the recipients for like two months, you mean?  Don't you believe  claims about deaths or severe health problems from the vaccines, till now? How about long term safety? Has anybody study that?  How could they, since the vaccines received eua, not even a year ago. And there are studies that express concern for potential future health problems.</p>

        <p>This is very similar to what Bret Weinstein hypothesized on the Joe Rogan Podcast... basically the spike protein is proven to be able to break the blood-brain barrier, which essentially allows the brain to become toxified with all sorts of things that are naturally (or not) in the body but not supposed to be in the brain. That's why both long haulers and some vaccine recipients experience the brain fog symptoms. It's not the virus, it is the spike protein... add to that the spike protein is likely to cause cell death... Yikes.</p>

        <p>The reality of the situation is that you have to pick between the lesser of two 'evils'. I myself know 2 people who had reactions to pfizer, one who could not move her legs the next day, legs were paralyzed (since subsided), and another who had an inflamed heart.</p>
<p>I took both Pfizer vaccines and didnt have any serious reaction. I took it because im diabetic and when I get sick I get really sick (for example, if my brother has a cold and I catch it, I get it much worse).</p>
<p>I dont blame people for being cautious, as for me I wasnt 100% sure on taking it and I still have my worries, for example, what if this vaccine messes me up in 5 years time? </p>
<p>But then you see the other side... the covid side.... I know a lot of people think its blown way out of proportion, but in my opinion it really isnt. Ive had a friend who caught covid, who then passed it on to their parents, to have one of their parents pass away from it. I know friends and their parents who had to spend a month in ICU. In the UK, the longest sufferer was in ICU for 14 months, a diabetic. He later refused treatment and died because he didnt want to live like that anymore. There are young people all dealing with long covid, people getting lung transplants, etc. I know people who have had covid, and say they want to take the vaccine because covid kicked their ass.</p>
