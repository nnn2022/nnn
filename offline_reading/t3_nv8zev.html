    <strong>Pros and Cons of quitting or waiting to be discriminated against for medical status (i.e. fired)?</strong>
    <p><p>Unless you're part of a group lawsuit like the nurses in Texas, isn't it better to keep your job and make them fire you? At least in the United States?</p>
<p>The company I work for plans to make the shots mandatory if any of them receive FDA approval, but there will also be health and religious exceptions. I'm also not convinced that we'll see approval so I'm holding off on doing anything for now, making this a somewhat hypothetical question, but I'm curious. </p>
<p>Better to quit and make a statement? Or keep the job and make them fire you, thus forcing the company to discriminate against you based on medical status (a HIPPA violation)? Seems better to have the option for a wrongful termination suit, but am I missing anything from this argument?</p>
<p>I'd rather be able to have the option to stand up for my rights legally than simply leave. On the other hand, the easier path is to find another job without these requirements, but I don't like the idea of being forced out. What do you all think? If you're in a similar situation, how are you planning to handle it (or what choice have you already had to make)?</p></p>

        <p>This brings up a good point: better to be employed and force the employer to discriminate than to not even be let in the door. At minimum it forces them to reveal their hypocrisy.</p>

        <p>Definitely do this.  I recommend during everything perfectly at your job for the next little while.  Make friends with people.  Make them like you.  </p>
<p>Then, if you get fired, take it with dignity, but make sure everyone knows why you got fired.</p>

        <p>If and when they try and make it mandatory. I would consult my doctor. And a lawyer if necessary. </p>
<p>But I wouldn't give the the satisfaction of just quitting. They wouldn't be phased in the least most likely. I would make them nut up and fire me. Almost like calling their bluff.</p>

        <p>That's what I was thinking: that it is a bluff. They announced it will "probably" be mandated to get a much compliance as possible now, but then nothing will happen because no FDA approval.</p>

        <p>Hears the thing. This is why I'll consult my doctor and a lawyer if my company makes it mandatory. I'll talk to my cardiologist about this cause of my stint and other factors. I won't do anything without his say so. And a lawyer to see if the company will be held liable in case something happens to me cause of the vaccine. This is the reason I don't think companies will make it mandatory unless they can have immunity from lawsuits if something goes wrong. </p>
<p>If this was the flu shot it wouldn't be that big of a deal. But this covid vaccine is a whole different story.  We are the Guinea pigs for this thing.</p>

        <p>I dont know anything about the law, but playing devil's advocate, hoping to win a medical descrimination lawsuit in this environment seems sketchy, and it seems some employers can get around that by fabricating other reasons for firing. </p>
<p>If you quit you can just give a reason you wanted to find a better job or better working environment. </p>
<p>Them firing you immediately makes you look guilty to future employers no matter what.</p>

        <p>Don't quit, then you can't get unemployment for sure if you don't have another job right away.  It'll be just a maybe if you get fired for not taking the vaccine, but that is only if they list it as the reason.  Larger companies rarely give an official stated reason for firing, only unofficial talks that they document in case you sue.</p>
<p>There may also be a future class action lawsuit of some type, which you may want to be part of.  It's easier to prove you were fired for a reason rather than prove you were forced to quit for a reason.</p>
<p>In all reality, I doubt they'll fire you unless you are a medical professional or work somewhere else that vaccine requirements are common.  It's still risky on their part at this point.  You'll notice that a lot of these companies aren't hiring anyone not vaccinated, but they also aren't firing unvaccinated people who currently work there.</p>

        <p>That's kind of what I was wondering and is helpful to hear plus a good reminder about the "reason for leaving" element. There's too much question of legal liability still up in the air for me to make any move before it's necessary, and I may not need to do anything. No one seems to want to be stuck with the liability not potato. </p>
<p>They might just ask me to not use on-site facilities, but I like working from home, so that's more of a win than a downside. I certainly could have it worse, but trying to prepare myself as a precaution. Thanks!</p>

        <p>Except we've been explicitly told at work that we'll never know if the people we work with are vaccinated or not because there will be religious and medical exemptions. There will literally be people who are unvaccinated in the same setting, just with an "approved" exemption. This obviously isn't about "endangering" or there wouldn't be exemptions.</p>

        <p>I've been given permission by my supervisor to work remotely indefinitely given my role, despite most other coworkers returning to the workplace soon. I do not have to be physically around anyone at work, so there's no concern about me being in contact with customers or coworkers. There's literally no reason to get jabbed except my own health, and I already have natural antibodies from surviving the sickness. </p>
<p>So no, to reiterate, there is no "endangering" involved at my workplace.</p>
