    <strong>If you've been vaccinated, you're not allowed to enter!</strong>
    <p><p>The vaccinated are more dangerous at this point. It's going to become obvious before too long. If you were fucking retarded enough to take that shit in your arm, you can not come in my house. You are not only a brainwashed sheep, you are a toxic cesspool of mutating viral material. 
I experienced the opposite when my kids friends couldn't come over because we are well read and truth seekers who didn't shoot up the juice. 
So yeah, fuck you. If you're vaxxed. Stay the fuck away.</p></p>

        <p>Although I think your post is a bit on the strong side I definitely see where this could end up. After studying the occult and the elite for a few years it seems likely that this little ritual is destined to lead to a further division in society.</p>
<p>Now we all know the elite are all about bloodines. Many of them are interrelated in fact I have heard it said that almost all of the US presidents are related to the British Royal family in some way although I can not prove that. Anyway, it seems to me that this ritual is creating an elite class and a prolitariat genetically. I assume that no elite class are taking any form of vaccine and obviously we have seen a number of obvious fakes. There will no longer be just an occult spiritual differentiation. There will be a physical one. Think of it like the mud bloods in Harry Potter and the pure bloods. Far be it from me to rejoice in this abomination. It makes me very sorry for those that have not taken the time to understand that symbolically and physically this could have profound effects on the future of humanity.</p>

        <p>I didn't advocate inviting them to your home... and yes, as they are indoctrinated they DO represent a serious health risk.  I get the OP's sentiment; I just see the submission playing right into the hands of the handlers dividing and distracting us.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, I don't really give a damn about the handlers. I almost admire them for the altogether amazing job they've done. What I cannot admire or understand is people who prop up their amazing, destructive, cataclysmic regime <em>in exchange for a fucking donut.</em> The golly-gee-whiz-just-doin-my-job folks are objectively worse and more sinister for being not only insane, murderous, thoughtless drones, but, crucially, for being <em>artless retards</em> who can be bought so easily. I almost understand the depopulation scheme, at this point. <em>I'm almost sympathetic, in fact.</em></p>

        <p>This thinking is just a different route to authoritarianism, only an individual can decide what is in their best interest. If you believe they are misinformed all you can do is try to inform them. I know it seems impossible but starting off with anger and fear will not work and puts you in the same camp as the worst doomers.</p>

        <p>Well, I'm sorry to hear that. We are all humans and all have the same basic needs and desires, to have fun, to love and take care of our families. You should be very sceptical of any narrative that tries to put us against each other because there is only a nearing zero portion of humanity who benefits from it. Certainly not you or the people you are directing your anger at.</p>

It's as easy as that. </p>
<p>I have spent the past 25 years traveling the world. I have been to 57 countries. I have lived in 12 and have studied 17 languages.

        <p>I was told years ago by an ex friend that she didn't let unvaccinated kids play with her kids. I started asking her if she and her parents and her husband's parents were all up to date on their adult boosters and shots. I asked her if she takes her kids shopping with her around strangers or lets them go to the playground. I asked her if she asked strangers to provide proof of vaccination everywhere she goes with her kids. She just started stuttering. She worked at one of those indoor children's playground/learning centers. They don't ask for vaccines before they let kids in. It's so ABSURD and they refuse to realize it. This must be her wet dream. She probably finally feels validated.</p>

        <p>Please take the vax shedding with a grain of salt. At this point there is very little evidence of it and it's almost reverse doomerism leading to more division and fear. That is what the psychopaths want, for us to be afraid of and mad at our neighbors and family. Keep cool and don't give these fuckers any freebies. Just keep on 😁.</p>
