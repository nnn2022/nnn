    <strong>Newsweek Opinion: My Son Took His Own Life. It Was the Lockdown That Got Him</strong>
    <p><p>&rt; There's a huge tradeoff to the endless government lockdowns that we just don't talk about enough. Email messages, phone calls, Facetime, and video conferencing simply cannot replace physical human connection, the sharing of a meal, the touch of hand, a hug or kiss. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-mental-health-burnout-lonely-depressed-money-stress#millennials-are-experiencing-a-health-shock-largely-fueled-by-a-decline-in-mental-health-1">Business Insider</a> reviewed the mental-health state of millennials and found that they have higher rates of depression than other generations. And the country's COVID-19 crisis <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/millennial-mental-health-coronavirus-pandemic-quarantine-2020-5">only exacerbated the issue</a>. About a quarter of Americans as a whole and 49% of those who were already lonely reported a deterioration in mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak and resulting social isolation. And for young Americans, things were even more dire: In August, <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/mental-health-statistics-covid-19-generation-z-millennials-suicide-substance-abuse/">the CDC foun</a>d that one in four Americans between the ages of 18 and 24 had considered suicide in the previous thirty days. </p>

        <p>It's really sad just how badly lockdowns effect younger people and just about everyone honestly... Wish there were more posts and stats on this, maybe even the braindead doomers would get it</p>

        <p>No matter what stats you give them, they’ll still find a way to defend this, unfortunately. There’s no reasoning with doomers. They’re too far gone at this point.</p>

        <p>I know we usually say they're "too far gone", but actually, I'm not sure. Recently, I've seen plenty of doomers even on /r/coronavirus finally changing their viewpoints and saying that the world overreacted (mostly on the daily discussion threads, which are the sane threads on that subreddit), and it's been a breath of fresh air, even if it took them nearly a year to finally figure it out, at least better late than never, right? Sure, there are still the extreme doomers, but it seems like their viewpoints are becoming less popular over time.</p>

        <p>The reason that it's impossible to convince them of any ACTUAL science is because their limbic systems shut down their critical thinking faculties when the 24/7 MSM fear propaganda and psyop began in Q1 2020. It literally requires supernatural intervention to get them out of this state.</p>
