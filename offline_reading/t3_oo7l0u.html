        <p>At the outset we were told 20 million may die. We were told people were dying in the streets in China. Our "Media" and "Government" locked us in our homes and made us afraid to touch door knobs, and convinced us that anyone of any age might die from Covid. Even today they try to convince us that kids under 17 may die and need to be vaccinated - even though the science shows they have a 99.998% survival rate.</p>
<p>They needed to create the fear and "crisis" that would get everyone on board for testing to find the coronavirus - the virus that causes the common cold. And then - by blaming that common cold for "covid deaths" when in previous years they would have been listed under the 4+ other comorbidities that the patient suffered - they could create the "crisis" they needed to institute all kinds of political and societal changes. Changes that are mostly made by decree, not by any legislative or democratic process.</p>
<p>You could have created the same "Pandemic" in any other year if you tested everyone who went to a hospital or died for a coronavirus, and then attributed the cause of death to that coronavirus. All it took was the fear and panic to get that ball rolling - as well as an aging population that was going to increase yearly deaths due to their age.</p>
<p>We never tested everyone at a hospital for coronavirus before 2020 because it is a crazy idea and not scientific at all. Only panic and fear could convince doctors and hospitals and "health care professionals" and "scientists" to test everyone for the virus that causes the common cold, and then attribute "Deaths For Any Reason" to that cold, rather than the 4+ other more obvious reasons.</p>
