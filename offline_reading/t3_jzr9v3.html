<p>Portuguese Court Rules PCR Tests “Unreliable” &amp; Quarantines “Unlawful” Important legal decision faces total media blackout in Western world</p>
<p><strong>An appeals court in Portugal has ruled that the PCR process is <em>not</em> a reliable test</strong> for Sars-Cov-2, and therefore any enforced quarantine based on those test results is unlawful.</p>
<p>Further, the ruling suggested that any forced quarantine applied to healthy people could be a violation of their fundamental right to liberty.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the judges ruled that a single positive PCR test cannot be used as an effective diagnosis of infection.</p>
<p>The specifics of the case concern four tourists entering the country from Germany – all of whom are anonymous in the transcript of the case – who were quarantined by the regional health authority. Of the four, only one had tested positive for the virus, whilst the other three were deemed simply of “high infection risk” based on proximity to the positive individual. All four had, in the previous 72 hours, tested negative for the virus before departing from Germany.</p>
<p>In their ruling, judges Margarida Ramos de Almeida and Ana Paramés referred to several scientific studies. Most notably this study by Jaafar et al., which found that – <strong>when running PCR tests with 35 cycles or more – the accuracy dropped to 3%, meaning <em>up to 97%</em> of positive results could be false positives.</strong></p>
<p>The ruling goes on to conclude that, based on the science they read, any PCR test using over 25 cycles is totally unreliable. Governments and private labs have been very tight-lipped about the exact number of cycles they run when <strong>PCR testing, but it is known to sometimes be as high as 45</strong>. Even fearmonger-in-chief Anthony Fauci has publicly stated anything over 35 is totally unusable.</p>

<p>There’s also a good write up on it on Great Game India, 
https://greatgameindia.com/portuguese-court-pcr-tests-unreliable/</p>
<p>plus a Portuguese professor sent a long email about the case to Lockdown Sceptics.
https://lockdownsceptics.org/2020/11/16/latest-news-195/#portuguese-appeals-court-deems-pcr-tests-unreliable</p>
<p>The media reaction to this case has been entirely predictable – they have not mentioned it. At all. Anywhere. Ever.</p>
<p>The ruling was published on November 11th, and has been referenced by many alt-news sites since…but the <strong>mainstream outlets are maintaining a complete blackout on it.</strong></p>
<p>The reddit Covid19 board actually removed the post, because it was “not a reliable source”, despite relying on the official court documents:</p>
<p>Lookout for a forced and disingenuous “fact-check” on this issue from HealthFeedback or some other “non-partisan” outlet in the near future. But until they find some poor shlub to lend their name to it, the media blackout will continue.</p>
<p>Whatever they say, <strong>this is a victory</strong> for common sense over authoritarianism and hysteria.</p></p>

        <p>You cannot post this in any of the coronavirus subs, not even the regional ones, because the admins have the claws sunk deep into them and require all such subs to operate in a pro-vaccine, pro-lockdown mode.</p>

        <p>No, labs are not 'tight-lipped' about this. When Mom and I got tested for CoVid-19 after my father was hospitalized and died from it in May, it said right on the results how many cycles they were doing: 35.</p>
<p>Now Johns Hopkins Hospital, where my test was done, has lowered it to 30 after data came back on how inaccurate the tests were at 35.</p>
<p>Though the test was accurate for Mom and I because we started showing symptoms.</p>
