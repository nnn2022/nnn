    <strong>Lack of enthusiasm for the holidays</strong>
    <p><p>Is anyone just burnt out on trying to drop what they're doing and pretend everything is normal for holiday celebrations?</p>
<p>I'm getting almost no time off work, and I'm just not in the mood. I'm spent. We're forced to isolate for months on end, and all of a sudden we're supposed to feel cheery and want to see family? (My doomer family is doomerish, but they still want to see me). It's tough.</p>
<p>To be clear, I'm not depressed. I just hate this process. It's painful to have to adapt my life to not having social interaction, and it's painful again to somehow change that, and it's further painful at a higher level to be okay with being tugged around and told how to adapt my life -- I want to control my life, not you.</p>
<p>The world is in an abusive relationship with me. I'm telling it 'fuck you, I'm keeping you at a distance and only dealing with you when I have to or want to'. I can't change that the world controls major aspects of my life these days, but I can assert control within what I am allowed to do.</p>
<p>It's interesting how my views on normalcy has gone from "we need to do whatever we can to maintain it" to "normalcy is an insult to my intelligence".</p>
<p>I half want to tell my family - "want to see me? then lift the lockdowns."</p></p>

        <p>Ive been describing this as an abusive relationship since the beginning.  I couldn't be around any pro lockdown doomers right now, I just don't have the energy to argue with zealots.</p>

        <p>The reason for the winter holidays are largely religious or cultural in nature. Focus on that instead of the traditional gifts and consumerism.</p>

        <p>I'm not jaded about the consumerist nature of the holidays. I'm tired of being pulled/pushed around.</p>

        <p>Yes, this exactly.  I’ve found that going back to what I’ve always done has eased this a bit.  I do miss seeing the religious family i had grown to take for granted.  I look forward to worshipping with them again soon.</p>

        <p>Agree with you. However, they’ve stopped the church service from happening where I live, replacing it with an outdoor service, which then they cancelled. </p>
<p>Finished work on 23rd, normally I’d be feeling excited and restful, this year I was just depressed.</p>
