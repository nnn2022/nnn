        <p>Exactly! What the fuck ever happened to being able to talk freely. Why are mods creeping through my history anyway? That's not their  job, afaik their job is to keep people from breaking rules.</p>
<p>My post was simply offering support to someone who may be having an adverse reaction like my FIL. My advice actually may have helped him if it got through because my FIL had a somewhat similar experience.</p>
<p>I personally was willing to take the risk of the vaccine. I don't believe I am at any grave risk but I also was not too afraid of the vaccine. I accepted the risk to get back to pre covid days as I hate living like this, if you call this living.</p>
<p>I understand that some people may not agree with this and feel the risk of this new vaccine is something they choose to accept. That is their choice and they should be entitled to make their own decision.</p>

        <p>The thing is that if you want the vaccine, take it. I'm cool with that. It's people that try and force others to take, that's the problem.</p>

        <p>agree 1000%, if you don't want it, how does that affect my life?  I can even understand the reasoning. </p>
<p>It's a personal medical choice, I would feel bad if I pushed someone to get it and they had a bad reaction. It's also none of my God damn business or anyone else's.</p>

        <p>Yup, I honestly don't care who gets vaccinated. It's insane to me that I an suppose to be the vaccine police and because I don't believe in forcing vaccine I must have some global anti vaccine position and can't offer support. I'm fucking vaccinated lol.</p>
<p>I stumbled upon that subreddit, same as this one. The person was asking for advice. I told my story and only said to trust their bodies and go to hospital if they felt they should. Never even bashed the vaccine.</p>
<p>I dont believe in forcing people with vaccines but believe people should have a choice. I personally got it as I believe Canada is prob gonna have a vaccine checklist and I want to be able to travel, go to casinos, clubs etc. </p>
<p>I was a bit nervous to even take it after my FIL experience but for me I didn't even notice it. </p>
<p>TBH, to have to keep living like this, I honestly didn't really care what happened to me. I am so sick of lockdowns and the ridiculous rules that make no sense. </p>
<p>The risk of taking it for my to be able to travel and go back to normalize were worth it to me. </p>
<p>Whether it is safe or not, time will tell. Maybe nothing will happen or maybe in 1 year all my hair will fall out. I honestly don't care, the last 2 years were hell for me as I imagine most of you so if this helps me be able to acceptably take off a mask and talk to people again, so be it.</p>

        <p>In Canada now, the astrozenica vaccine has been available for a while. </p>
<p>I was not willing to take the risk on that as I have heard a lot of stories of countries banning it. I have also heard that it causes blood clots ( I don't know it that is true or to what degree).</p>
<p>The Phizer vaccine had a better reputation tho still has a risk that I was personally willing to accept.</p>
<p>Like the flu shot, I don't give a fuck who chooses to take it. I was willing to take it. Some are not. It's a personal choice </p>
<p>What the hell has happened where we must have agendas and take sides to offer support in this pandemic? We have all lost over 1% of our life locked down, this has been difficult for everyone.</p>
<p>That's the end of my rant, some insane mods here.</p>

        <p>We follow truth over facts now. Why is it so hard for these extremists to understand. You can only speak to the agenda. Don’t ride the line. Don’t try to have a well rounded view. Stop trying to see both sides of the argument. Just take the vaccine, post your selfie, pay your taxes, and shut the fuck up. Slow Joe and the Hoe with take care of the rest.

        <p>Well now they're saying WE the unvaccinated are health threats to the public since our bodies, ALLEGEDLY, allow the virus to thrive and grow, and mutate, placing even vaccinated individuals at risk.   We, too, are at risk and they're "trying their best" (NOT) to save us from ourselves.  In the meantime, they're doing their best to scrub the net of of people detailing their personal vaccine reactions, and credentialed medical professionals sounding the warning alarms with dissenting testimonies.</p>
<p>This should not be a Republican vs Democrat issue when ALL OF US are clearly being misled.</p>

        <p>I agree, I took down this post because the mod ended up reporting me for anti vaccination, brigading on NNN and moderator harrassment.</p>
<p>lol how can I be anti vaccination, I support free choice.</p>
<p>And I dont get why others not getting vaccinated affects me. If this works I should be less likely to get covid and if I do more likely to survive it. Why should others force it on you?</p>

<p>I can think that the vaccine is a individual choice and it shouldn't be forced, a lot of the pandemic rules are hypocritel, pointless and also be able to offer support to someone without being accused of having a global "agenda".</p>

        <p>I don’t understand how folks are pro life if they won’t help these kids as much as possible. You’d figure that if they really did care about the children, they’d provide them with access to quality healthcare and education, higher wages for their parents, etc....</p>
<p>It only seems they’re pro birth, and once the kid is born they could give a shit.</p>

        <p>Well, hard to provide for the baby when it is dead....</p>
<p>You are grouping every pro life person into one category, the category that doesn't give a shit about them when they are born. </p>
<p>I have two kids I raise as best I can so obviously I give a shit because me and my wife decided not to end their life and instead give them a family. </p>
<p>Do you think every single person who is pro life  are the same and think the same? Some of us just believe life begins at conception and is precious and should not be slaughtered before they even had a chance at life because some dude or girl didn't have a rubber. Or it feels better without one and they had a baby.</p>
<p>Adoption and birth control are things readily available in a lot of cases. </p>
<p>I am OK with abortions in rape cases, incest, health problems. But they are the far minority.</p>
<p>The irony is we couldn't have this conversation if you were aborted.</p>

        <p>I’m glad you’re in a position to give your children a good life. There’s a lot of folks out there not as well off as you or I. They’re the ones I’m referring to. Dude bounces after he found out she was pregnant. In a bad relationship that bringing a child into would only put them in danger as well. Folks that know they just can’t afford another mouth to feed on the wages they’re making. Those are the ones that primarily use these services. Better educations and easier access to healthcare would actually decrease the need for the very poorest to use this service. </p>
<p>To assume I know what these women are going through when making a decision like this disingenuous. For you to assume it, is as well. Then blocking access to the resources these kids need to have a better chance at life is crewel. You say pro life. The policies show pro birth.</p>

        <p>I dont know if your correct on who uses the services without statistics.</p>
<p>I dont have to use crack to know it is wrong. I am not doubting the girls have a tough decision. Deciding if you are ready to have a child at any age is a tough decision.</p>
<p>I am not also not making policies or blocking their access to resources. I also am not standing outside abortion centers pointing dead fetus (which look like a little person after 2 months). </p>
<p>I generally keep my opinion to myself about the topic for the most part as it is just one man's thoughts on a very complex topic if which there are millions of arguments for and against.</p>
<p>You mentioned pro life in your other comment and I gave my personal opinion. I am entitled to mine as you are to yours and we obviously are not gonna change each other's minds. That's OK, we don't have to and we can still co exist, just like people who choose to get the vaccine and people that don't.</p>

        <p>no, my wife booked it for me. I have a 75 YO father so I qualified early in Canada to get it.</p>
<p>I understand it's rushed and can be described as experimental in the sense we don't know long term affects. I took it knowing the risks of blood clots etc.</p>
<p>It may have been the wrong decision, time will tell. I feel normal so far and was not particularly worried about covid. I am just sick of the way we have been living for the last  year I would take anything to end this sooner.</p>
<p>I weighed the risk and was ok taking it. I respect people who decided otherwise.</p>
<p>It is creepy seeing American politicians offering lotteries and fast food to persuade people to take it tho.</p>

        <p>i feel you 100% bro and completely respect your right not to take it. </p>
<p>If it wasn't for my kids, I would left Toronto a while ago and moved somewhere small and warm on the beach.</p>
<p>It is insane times. And I do agree this has all been blown out of proportion. The data the government of Ontario has provided show that most of the deaths were 60 and older and the vast majority were 80 and older. Not that isn't sad but like say, how many were covid deaths and how many were just 80 YOs who couldn't survive a strong flu? </p>
<p>I took this post down because the mod who I was posting about who banned me from covid support asked for medical proof my father in law was in the hospital (creepy thing to ask for) and reported me for my apparently anti vaccination, brigading on NNN and moderator harrassment. Prob gonna lose this account for having a different viewpoint. Seriously an insane world.</p>
<p>I'm vaccinated and posted how I believe people should have the right to choose. GL!</p>
