    <strong>Any good sources that refute "long Covid"?</strong>
    <p><p>Today while I was on the bus, there was this woman talking about how she still hasn't recovered from covid and experiences daily back pain as well as nausea.</p>
<p>Now, one could reasonably argue that those are very common symptoms that could be caused by a multitude of issues that aren't covid.</p>
<p>And odds are that she instantly assumed it must be the Rona's aftermath and didn't bother going to the doctor to investigate other possibilities.</p>
<p>But that alone isn't good enough. Do you guys happen to have any sources on the subject?</p></p>

        <p>Yes. It got renamed the same as the flu did. Its common name is 'post viral fatigue'.</p>

        <p>"Long Covid" definitely falls into the "Assertions made without evidence, can be dismissed without evidence" category.</p>

        <p>Use the same stats to show that short covid is hyperbolized. PCR tests etc</p>

        <p>Non specific chronic illnesses are great for people wanting payouts or disability benefits.</p>
<p>I'm sure long covid does exist, but as no test exists to prove it, I am sure many are abusing it.</p>

        <p>Okay so I am as one of you as it gets but please don't discount that there could be some type of chronic covid injury. I speak about this with first-hand knowledge. For the last year my knees, hips, and lower back have been in tremendous pain. It's this aching pain that comes and goes in its intensity and frequency. Before I was sick I never had joint pain of any type. I'm a young healthy man (or was) and I truly believe this is a result of being sick with the human engineered virus that we often talk in terms of bio weapon.</p>
<p>It is disingenuous for us to think that any injury that is chronic is made up and then talk about the CCP engineering a weapon. I know that if I was to create a virus I would want maximum impact immediately and then anyone who survived to be disabled. We already know they have taken SARS-COV-1 and spliced in some HIV and added a few other awful bits so there is no telling how this is going to affect us forever.</p>
<p>I'm not crazy and this pain is not in my head. I really would hate it if this dub turned against the idea that this could be real.</p>
<p>Edit: I just want to add I think "long covid" is a stupid fucking name.</p>

        <p>Hope you can get that sorted dude. I've had chronic health issues for years from meds I was forced on as a teen and no one believed me and my symptoms were disabling and didn't make sense. Healing has been slow, but it has been possible. Hopefully you'll figure out what your body needs. HMU if u ever want hippie mind-over-matter chats about health</p>
