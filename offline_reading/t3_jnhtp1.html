    <strong>Today's the day we Americans take our country back and defend against the onslaught of tyranny</strong>
    <p><p>For my brothers and sisters around the world, outside the U.S. You all know what this day means, not only for the U.S. but for the world. This will be one of the last bastions of freedom, in a world so corrupt and ensnared in the clutches of communism as it has seeped into our media, our governments, our lives. </p>
<p>I've been blessed to have traveled and lived outside the United States and have been to every continent save Antarctica. What I can tell you about people around the world is that we're all the same. We all have the same ambitions to fulfill our dreams of a better tomorrow. Regardless of which nation, creed, race, sex we are born, we all desire freedom. </p>
<p>This new normal is anything but freedom. It's Slavery. We will fight against it. I will fight for my country, I will fight for you and your freedoms. Love and Light of the one infinite creator to you all. </p>
<p>" Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!" -Patrick Henry</p></p>

        <p>It's sad because Trump is a bad choice too - he disregards the environment, and supports hunting endangered species etc etc the list goes on, but just like 4 years ago the other choice is just as bad! Basically Americans are voting on lockdown rather than using their chance to get a president with any sort of sense.</p>

        <p>Basically. I voted Trump due to lockdown but he sucks overall - doesn't support lockdown though. </p>
<p>Haven't heard about his support in hunting endangered species though. Any source ? Not doubtful just curious.</p>

        <p>I remember something from a few years ago where his family members were hunting endangered animals in Africa. I don’t like that, but he’s anti lockdown so I still support him</p>

        <p>What is everyone doing within their bubble (Even if your bubble only contains yourself) What steps are you taking to ensure your freedoms?</p>
<p>I for example live in Canada which has limited free speech and very strict gun control.</p>
<p>I have invested in a bug out bag for long term survival if my country goes full lockdown, introduces UBI, covidpass's or, mandatory vaccines.</p>
<p>We are in a fight against tyranny, the globalists are very close to their end goal, complete and total control of land, assets, money and, people. The amount of sleeping sheep is absolutely and utterly terrifying, you can't speak out because you'll be attacked for being a conspiracy theorist and an enemy to all people for not conforming to the "new normal" ie, wearing masks, social distancing, having differing opinions.</p>
<p>What do we do? Do those who are awake stay silent? Do we fight back with sticks and stones? The Great Reset is on its way, we are so close to losing all of our freedoms that is our God given right, we are so close to seeing evil prevail. What must be done? Good people must stand up to this tyranny, we must stand up for those who can't, we must speak up for those who can't, we must fight. we HAVE to fight.</p>
<p>Who do we fight though? There is no visible enemy, its all behind closed doors. Just know friends that there are silent freedom fighters ready to come out from hiding to fight back against socialism, fascism, globalism and, corrupt governments.</p>
<p>We cannot push it onto future generations, we must deal with it now. This is our fight. We didn't build this system, we were born into it, we inherited it. It wasn't fair to us, but it would be worse for us to be aware and still pass it onto future generations. That would make us complicit and just as evil as the puppeteers.</p>

        <p>I'm uncomfortable posting too many details on a public forum but I'll say we plan to stay in our home as long as possible, whatever that entails.</p>
<p>If we're forced to leave we have family to hook up with and figure it all out on the go but have nowhere concrete to congregate long term.</p>
<p>We will go down fighting and as a parent that's a terrifying but necessary decision to make.</p>

        <p>Use Google maps, look at your city. How many points of entry are there. Figure out where you think military checkpoints might be, have a plan to get out of the city as safely and quickly as you can. I've done it for my city and I have multiple routes of escape. </p>

<p>A time will come where we can no longer stay home and be submissive. I understand right now we are waiting for the time to come, the time for us to rise up will be soon. I won't tell you to stay safe, I will tell you to stay strong.</p>

<p>At least you have family that won't rat you out to the new abnormal "health" Gestapo, whether out of malice or thinking that it's "for your own good." I'm not so fortunate, sadly.</p>

It'd be basically with what I can carry on my back, but I actually do have a viable plan to escape to a (somewhat more) free state instead of the "new normal" police state I'm looking down the barrel of.</p>

        <p>IMO the most important thing at stake here is federalism. I have no comments on Trump's other policies atm but his choice of federalism and state's rights to address the plandemic is a literal life saver. It is the reason I wanna leave my shit state of MA and go to Georgia, where you are relatively much freer to interact. </p>
<p>Say what you will about Trump or democracy, but the best part about him is that he is not a NWO puppet like Biden, same reason Bernie could never be the dem nominee. If Biden is president, it would be the death of state's rights and mandates for everything. I am really terrified.</p>

        <p>Being opressed = victimhood. Victims either lose, or are saved by the Higher Power. Unless you can see a higher power than can save Trump... he will lose. </p>
<p>People are downvoting me because they think I WANT him to lose, but I am just trying to speak the truth. Trump is trying to win an argument in a subreddit where he is not the mod. This is impossible and it doesn't matter that this is unfair. In fact, this is impossible BECAUSE this setup is unfair. </p>
<p>Trump censorship is real, which means he will not be able to get his point across to the nation, which will mean that he will lose. Honestly, I was hoping that Trump will win the battle against CNN. He has supporters who can meme, and CNN has no real lucid viewers. Trump is the future of political populism, and CNN is an old establishment of a pre-internet era. Well, the irony is that CNN will outlive him. Sadly.</p>

        <p>I apologize for the cuck comment, but you should really do your homework. DT may be a narcissistic chauvinist that spouts off whatever he wants with no filter, but he wasn't bought and paid for by China.   </p>
<p>Please do your own research and hopefully you'll come to the same conclusion so many others have. I retract my cuck statement.</p>

        <p>Sure.</p>
<p>However, China has many smart managers working for CCP, who built a spectacular economy, going from a third world country into challenging the US. You can't say they are all idiots out there. The Chinese know what they are doing.</p>
<p>Also, the US is not in it's best shape. Races don't get along, states don't get along, republicans and democrats don't get along, there are riots and looters in the streets, economy is -40% YOY, there are homeless junkies, human poop and needles everywhere, etc etc...</p>
<p>I can very well see the US losing this round to China. Just like Russia went from a superpower to a failed state in the 1990s, the US will get worse before it gets better. China's only problem right now is that US situation is so bad it is hurting Chinese exports. Think about it.</p>

        <p>I really hope you take a hard look at the life you lead up to 2019. I used to live in China, in Shanxi province in the city of Taiyuan. Trust me, the Chinese in leadership are smart, conniving, and deceitful. The remainder of the Chinese populace have been subjugated to propaganda for their entire lives. You do NOT want China to win, or say goodbye to your liberties. You will be told when to sleep, when to eat, when to stay inside cause the boogeyman is outside, when you can go out, when to shit, what to eat, what you can say, and where you can go.   </p>
<p>You honestly don't think that same control isn't being enacted throughout the world right now. Covid Health Pass? Immunization passports? Detention Centers in NZ? What the actual fuck is this shit? You don't see this happening? You don't see Jacinda Arden of NZ saying that people will go to these centers and stay for 14 days unless they're tested with PCR tests? And what if they don't test? They will stay for another 14 days. Her own fucking words out of her own mouth.</p>
<p>NWO is no fucking joke and this is the year they start implementing their plans. It will be a change over the next decade where our liberties will be stripped away and we clasp the collar around our own necks because we voted for it.  </p>
<p>btw here's a fun place to start. page 18 is the scenario we're currently in. If you don't want the Elite to win then please educate yourself, nobody else will do it for you. </p>

        <p>&rt;You do NOT want China to win</p>
<p>I see you are confusing what you 'want to happen' with 'what will actually happen'. I am only talking about the latter. This is not a make-a-wish foundation.</p>
<p>&rt;or say goodbye to your liberties</p>
<p>Civil liberties is what lead to this situation in the first place. You probably consider Biden as an anti-american candidate. Well, the fact that the anti-american candidate is running and winning, proves that the US is a country with many civil liberties, but you see the obvious problem with it.</p>
<p>China would not allow an anti-chinese politician to run in the elections, let alone win it.</p>
<p>&rt;NWO is no fucking joke and this is the year they start implementing their plans</p>
<p>And Donald Trump will not stop them.</p>
