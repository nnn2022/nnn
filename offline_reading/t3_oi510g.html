    <strong>This Sub Needs To Talk More About This "Inevitable" Cyber Scamedemic That They're Preparing. They're Already Having "Simulations" About It, Just Like Event 201.</strong>
    <p><p>Before any of you call this a "conspiracy" theory, it's not. According to the WEF, COVID-19 was known as an anticipated risk, and so is its digital equivalent.</p>
<p>&rt;What’s more, “A cyber attack with COVID-like characteristics would spread faster and farther than any biological virus. Its reproductive rate would be around 10 times greater than what we’ve experienced with the coronavirus.” In his welcoming remarks at Cyber Polygon 2020, WEF Founder Klaus Schwab warned about a coming “cyber pandemic” that would be worse than the current global crisis.</p>
<p>&rt;“We all know, but still pay insufficient attention to, the frightening scenario of a comprehensive cyber attack, which would bring a complete halt to the power supply, transportation, hospital services, our society as a whole,” he said.</p>
<p>&rt;“The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison to a major cyber attack.”</p>
<p>&rt;Schwab added, “It is important to use the COVID-19 crisis as a timely opportunity to reflect on the lessons of cybersecurity community to draw and improve our unpreparedness for a potential cyber pandemic.”</p>
<p>&rt;As the digital world encroaches on our physical and biological worlds, an effective cyber attack could compromise anything connected to the internet, including:</p>
<p>&rt;Medical devices that keep people alive</p>
<p>&rt;The Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem of connected devices that run smart homes (i.e. cameras, microphones, sensors, etc.)</p>
<p>&rt;The Internet of Bodies (IoB) ecosystem of digitally-connected humans</p>
<p>&rt;Global financial systems</p>
<p>&rt;Energy grids</p>
<p>&rt;Water treatment facilities</p>
<p>&rt;Government IT systems</p>
<p>&rt;Military and defense infrastructure</p>
<p>&rt;And more</p>
<p>&rt;Currently, “The only way to stop the exponential propagation of a COVID-like cyber attack threat,” according to the WEF, “is to fully disconnect the millions of vulnerable devices from one another and from the internet.”</p>
<p>&rt;But, “A single day without the internet would cost our economies more than $50 billion, and that’s before considering economic and societal damages should these devices be linked to essential services, such as transports or healthcare.”</p>
<p>&rt;“The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison to a major cyber attack” — Klaus Schwab</p>
<p>&rt;Needless to say, a cyber pandemic would wreak havoc on nearly all aspects of society.</p>
<p>&rt;However, the devil is in the details, and the solutions recommended for a cyber pandemic could be far more detrimental to individual liberty than the cyber attack itself.</p>
<p>&rt;“It is important to use the COVID-19 crisis as a timely opportunity to reflect on the lessons of cybersecurity community to draw and improve our unpreparedness for a potential cyber pandemic” — Klaus Schwab</p>
<p>https://sociable.co/technology/prepping-cyber-pandemic-cyber-polygon-stage-supply-chain-attack-simulation/ I quoted many things from the link and you MUST check it out. It says it all.</p>
<p>(I highly recommend you watch the videos). It's all said exactly by the main head guy of the World economic forum. And you all most remember, these are the same evil psychopaths who "simulated" this plandemic way before it was a pandemic. It's known as Event 201 and the elite aren't even hiding it anymore. They are basically saying their whole agenda openly indirectly.</p>
<p>Basically this means we all are fucked. Internet will be gone for awhile, supply chain will fuck up, basic necessities such as water lines and all that will be affected. Bank accounts can be drained and your technological investments may be worth nothing. Most likely, there can also be a black out. It can be anything and these psychopaths are doing another simulation for this event on July 9th. (it's currently going on) Scary times are ahead of us. No wonder why many are calling this upcoming winter, "The Dark Winter." Stock yourselves up and keep safe and mainly keep your mental health in check. They want you to go crazy.</p>
<p>Now from a new source because this "simulation" is currently taking place.</p>
<p>&rt;HARRISBURG, Pa. (WHTM) — The World Economic Forum kicked off its annual Cyber Polygon exercise Friday, which gives companies and governments the opportunity to participate in a simulation of a
“Cyber Pandemic”.</p>
<p>&rt;“It is inevitable that some larger attack is going to occur one day,” John Sancenito said.</p>
<p>&rt;The focus of the live drill this year is a targeted supply chain attack on a corporation. If a scenario like this happened in real life, it could impact our daily lives by shutting down water treatment facilities, the power grid, or the internet.</p>
<p>&rt;“What would you do if you can’t access your bank accounts, the internet, or your cell phone suddenly stopped working? These are the kinds of things people really do need to think through because one day we may be facing a crisis like that,” Sancenito said.</p>
<p>https://www.abc27.com/investigators/prepping-for-a-cyber-pandemic-worldwide-drill-underway/</p>
<p>These guys are basically saying it's "inevitable" and will happen. Basically this means this plandemic was nothing infront of it.</p></p>

        <p>There's nothing I can do about it, so that's why I don't fret about it.</p>
<p>In some ways I believe it may have a beneficial effect, as people would lose their distractions and would be forced to wake up.</p>
<p>At this point, it is <strong>electronics and electricity that is keeping them enslaved</strong>, and maybe you should consider a cyberattack a benevolent act.</p>
<p>A new Windows 11 being rolled out, the biggest spyware program in the world, is going to facilitate the monitoring and identification of everyone on the internet.</p>
<p>Now I will amass many downvotes on this, but I don't care.</p>
<p>I've watched my country Canada remain pacified by Netflix, online computer games and funded by government $2000+ monthly deposited into their account to do so.</p>
<p>Best thing to do right now is have all these people suddenly be staring blankly at the wall, with nothing to 'do' or distract them. They might be actually forced to think for once in many years..</p>
<p>It would free them.</p>
<p>Don't fear it. Instead prepare for it, and welcome it.</p>

        <p>Agreed!  But they can’t even think for themselves, they will crumble when we are off grid.  Tech, msm and a crappy school system has turned their brains to shit now.  I’m so grateful I grew up before the internet and phone corruption.</p>

<p>One of the endings actually involves the player working for ARC for a bunch of missions, with the finale being a number of cyberattacks using REVELATION (More or less a virus that bricks the system, then spreads to other connections) and trying to run it on as many remote systems as possible in an attempt to destroy the internet before a rival hacker can stop you or federal agents eventually trace your connection and pull the plug. (The other ending involves you working as the rival hacker and attempting to stop ARC.)</p>

        <p>It...annoys me... that this could even be a thing today. I would expect important networks to have backups and contingency plans and maybe even .. you know.. disconnect them from the www?

        <p>No. The “Dark Winter” Biden mentioned is two things: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Dark_Winter">Operation Dark Winter</a>, a simulated bio-terrorist attack, and a literal reference to a winter without power. Many people thought the real pandemic/grid down year would be last year, but we’re seeing from the evidence that it seems to be this one.</p>

<p>&rt;Operation Dark Winter was the code name for a senior-level bio-terrorist attack simulation conducted on June 22–23, 2001. It was designed to carry out a mock version of a covert and widespread smallpox attack on the United States. Tara O'Toole and Thomas Inglesby of the Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian Biodefense Strategies (CCBS) / Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), and Randy Larsen and Mark DeMier of Analytic Services were the principal designers, authors, and controllers of the Dark Winter project.</p>
