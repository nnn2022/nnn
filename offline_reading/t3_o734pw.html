    <strong>Long term side effects/ ADE / Cytokine storm chances 1 dose vs 2</strong>
    <p><p>Does anyone have any research or opinion on whether it will make much of a difference in the future wrt to long term effects or the doomsday scenario of mass vaccine deaths if someone has taken one dose of Pfizer but skipped the second? Asking for a loved one.</p></p>

        <p>Both doses are .3 supposedly. Hard to tell if the 2nd dose being worse is actually true or some wide spread delusion like masks stopping viruses. Maybe there is something extra in the 2nd dose being kept secret?</p>

        <p>Good question, I've been trying to research this to find out exactly how fucked I am. At a broad level, I think the only thing you can say is that you're significantly better off than if you had 2 doses, but obviously not as good as if you'd never taken the poison in the first place.</p>
<p>The thing with the second dose is that the risks are 3 fold: not only is LNP exposure and spike damage cumulative, but after your body has already been primed from the first dose you're more likely to have the S1 cleaved off and float freely due to action of t-cells, and we know these S1s aren't good. Also your body will mount a higher response attacking any spike-presenting cells, which means the risk of microclots increases sharply with the second dose.</p>
<p>Since you only had one dose, while some of this happened and the damage cannot be undone, it's nowhere near as bad as what would have happened with the second dose. And we know this empirically from the fact that most cases of heart inflammation are only after the second dose. </p>
<p>I also don't think there's going to be a doomdsay drop dead event even for those who took 2 doses, it's going to be a more of a slow burn where people have higher risks of developing allergies, autoimmune or clotting disorders over time, or they'll just have slightly shorter lifespan due to the damage done to vascular system from the vaccine. They might even develop alzheimers early on if some of the LNP/mrna got into the brain.</p>
<p>For those who took 1 dose, much better off in terms of prospects and if you treat your body like a temple for the rest of your life it probably will not be a major issue. And over time if the damage was minor enough it will probably never present an issue for day-to-day life. But keep in mind that the damage, even if minor, is still present so you have much less slack in terms of unhealthy habits. </p>
<p>Another risk is increased potential for inflammation and allergies. Your goal should be to cut down inflammation as much as possible for the next 2 years at least to prevent your immune system from going haywire and resulting in chronic conditions. The LNPs that are part of these vaccines cause a very very strong immune response, and that too they overshot the amount needed by a factor of 2 or 3 so from even just one dose your immune system will be on a hair trigger for the next year, and you are at increased risk of developing new allergies. Avoid things like pollen or other common allergens. Switch to an anti-inflammatory diet and increase your uptake of omega-3 and curcumin extract (bcm-95 is preferable). Make sure you are getting 2.5g at least of quality omega-3 (EPA+DHA) as that is what is needed to suppress immune activity. Again, it is important to do this as soon as possible since once the body's homeostasis is disrupted and it settles into a new state, the longer that state is maintained the harder it's going to be to alter it via natural methods (and definitely avoid OTC drugs or NSAIDs for the mean time, since your goal isn't to reduce the inflammation itself but to downregulate that entire pathway). Also generally take things like vitamin D/zinc.</p>
<p>Oh also very important: wear a mask this upcoming flu season. The last thing you want to do is to introduce another virus when your immune system is already hyperactive. I predict we're going to see a spike in this fall's flu severity, not due to ADE or other such things but just because the body will react more violently with an already primed and hyperactive immune system.</p>

        <p>LNPs (lipid nanoparticles) are a broad class of compounds. The specific ones used by pfizer/moderna are proprietary, I think they bought the tech from Acuitas. Because it's proprietary, I don't know of any studies with the specific LNPs they used, but it will surely be cleared out of your body eventually. There's https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/9/1/65 which is a literature review that actually mentions acuitas's LNPs. I skimmed it and tried to find some other sources mentioning specific half-life but couldn't find any concrete numbers, or maybe I'm not looking hard enough. If I had to make a guess I'd say the half-life should likely be less than a week, so it'll be cleared fully from the body in about a month? But I'm just a layperson so take that estimate with a grain of salt, although I doubt it's going to be <em>longer</em> than that.</p>
<p>The only actual distribution studies I recall seeing are from animal studies and that too only looking at the expression of the mrna rather than LNP itself (mrna is more unstable and will become unviable much faster), and that too in rats. And their study is very questionable since the way they measured mrna expression was by measuring expression of luciferase (makes things glow) one-shot instead of dissecting the animal and measuring each part.</p>
<p>Robert Malone explains this better than I could in a recent interview he did: https://brandnewtube.com/watch/reiner-fuellmich-with-mrna-technology-inventor-dr-robert-malone-9-7-21_W1B1HuEqQg866pt.html timestamp 44:53</p>
<p>(and here's the study from pfizer he mentioned that was obtained via FOIA, https://www.docdroid.net/xq0Z8B0/pfizer-report-japanese-government-pdf)</p>
<p>You might also be interested in reading through these two links that go more into LNP:</p>
<p>https://news.mit.edu/2020/rna-vaccines-explained-covid-19-1211
https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/drug-delivery/Without-lipid-shells-mRNA-vaccines/99/i8</p>
<p>Some key quotes:</p>
<p>&rt;Even some of the LNPs that worked well in animals proved too toxic for the repeated dosing required of many siRNA therapies. “The biggest issue was trying to find the right balance between systems that were effective but also safe and tolerable,” says Marian Gindy, executive director of pharmaceutical sciences at Merck &amp; Co., who led the RNA formulation team from 2008 until Merck ended its siRNA programs in 2013. “And I would say that is still the biggest challenge in this area.”</p>
<p>&rt;LNPs that looked good in the lab often floundered in the clinic, however. The first versions of ionizable lipids were still toxic. And early formulations of the nanoparticles didn’t degrade fast enough, causing them to accumulate after repeated injections. Protiva found that one of its experimental LNP therapies caused a more severe immune reaction in humans than it had in the lab, and the company pinned pegylated lipids as a major factor.</p>
<p>&rt;But PEG also has liabilities. It prevents LNPs from binding to proteins that help shuttle them into cells. Because PEG extends particles’ life span in the body, the immune system has more time to spot the particles and start mounting an antibody response. And although PEG is found in many cosmetic, drug, and food products, scientists hypothesize that some people could develop antibodies to PEG and that giving those individuals an injection of PEG-coated nanoparticles could trigger an anaphylactic reaction.</p>
<p>And indeed, the specific LNPs used by pfizer/moderna are PEGlynated. This is probably the first time this specific delivery mechanism has been tested widely in humans.</p>

        <p>It's not really something based on literature, just more of a intuitive hunch.</p>
<p>My reasoning is that when the body's biochemical processes have been disrupted, you don't want to add in another unknown thing into the mix. Or in other words, NSAIDs are more of a short-term crutch to address inflammation, when you should focusing on repairing the underlying pathways in the first place so your body can downregulate things on its own. </p>
<p>Though NSAIDs are relatively well studied, the body's biochemical process are very intricate and complex and I simply don't trust that selectively targeting one enzyme isn't going to mess something else up. Or in other words, when you're perfectly healthy taking NSAIDs once in a while is probably fine since your body can very quickly go back to the equilibrium it had before and temporarily inhibiting cox-1/cox-2 probably isn't much of an issue. But when your body's equilibrium has already been disrupted by god knows what and the pathways have been messed up, who knows what inhibiting a targeted enzyme is going to do?</p>
<p>Also more practically speaking you can't take NSAIDs every day or you'll damage other parts of your body as well (another byproduct of the fact that the body's biochemical processes are complex, and you can't ever be sure that independently altering one thing doesn't inadvertently affect something else).</p>
<p>Supplements are "safer" in that you're not targeting one enzyme in particular, and the body already has robust mechanisms in place to handle food we eat so that it's a lot harder to do any damage. But still don't go overboard on those, just stick to maybe 2 or 3 ones you feel are helping the most and get the rest from food instead.</p>

        <p>If the body is in constantly inflammation during this period( cleaning up spike protein ), doesn’t we want to make sure the minimum damage is done during the period by using NSAID for short term damage control and switch back to body healing by itself after the period . It is just how I picture it.</p>

        <p>That's also a fair point, and I don't want to give medical advice so you should see what works best for you. It's not really a hard and fast rule, so if you have very severe inflammation then yeah it's probably beneficial to use the NSAID in the short-term to address that.</p>
<p>I just wouldn't take NSAIDs every day since even for a healthy person that leads to bad long-term effects. If you want to take NSAIDs for short-term, you could try reducing the dosage or spacing it out (e.g. once every 3 days).</p>

        <p>I think for my situation, which is mostly neuro inflammation,I am sticking with ibuprofen since aspirin cannot cross blood-brain barrier (correct me if I am wrong). For a short term, and see if it helps.  I think OTC ones should be relatively in dose</p>
