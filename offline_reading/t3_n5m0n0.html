    <strong>When the history of this time period is talked about, it is unlikely that they will bring up that it was during an American election year.</strong>
    <p><p>The fact that this was so politicized will probably not end up in the history books. The fact that a US Presidential election was going on totally changed how things were dealt with. Any response or precised lack of response was used as a weapon against political opponents.</p></p>

        <p>At this point, it has nothing to do with politics, but before the election I think doomers did use it as an excuse to go after Trump. I don’t really care about Trump either way, for context. But it did happen imo. </p>
<p>It really sucks that we’re in this situation now because people hated the BaD OrAnGe MaN so much that they were willing to destroy society over it.</p>

        <p>Lol I am not a fan either. They’re all turds swirling around in a giant toilet (all politicians I mean, or almost all of them). But this ronus was definitely utilized by the people against Trump as a way to get him out of office. That’s all I’m saying</p>
