    <p><p>I can't speak for everyone on here but believe it or not I am fine with you wearing a face-diaper, staying the fuck away from me and taking an experimental jab. I think you're a fucking clown but I support your dumb-ass decision to waste the best years of your life "fighting" a virus with a 99.9% survival rate by binge-watching Netflix and slathering yourself in hand sanitizer. You have the freedom to do that. I won't fucking stop you. I probably should as I'm just indulging your mental breakdown and downward spiral but fuck it. You didn't step in to help me when the lockdowns fucked with my mental health so I'll just return the favour. You're on your own.</p>
<p>You can fucking self-isolate for as long as you like. We are technologically advanced enough for you to comfortably do that. Order all the GrubHub you can fucking eat. Work from fucking home and deepen the gigantic ass-crater in your swivel chair until the whole thing fucking gives way. It's a sad, pathetic fucking existence but hey: GO FOR IT. This should have been a choice all along and that's what it should be from here on out. I don't have high hopes for the winter and I think we're just gonna slide right back into another lockdown and further restrictions because of some miraculous "variant" that circumvents the vaccine and only targets the vaccinated but for the time being I'm going to be slightly optimistic.</p>
<p>Everyone on here wants one thing: control of their life back. I do not enjoy having my freedom and bodily autonomy held and crushed by the government like a mobster's balls in a vice. You are backing us into a fucking corner here like animals and you're fucking shocked when we lash out in retaliation.</p>
<p>The facts are this:</p>
<p>Lockdowns are unsustainable; another one will kill the fucking economy and any small businesses left standing right now. You wanna see real carnage? FUCKING BRACE YOURSELF IF ANOTHER LOCKDOWN HAPPENS.</p>
<p>Gran (who, by the way, HAS HAD THE FUCKING VACCINE so should be safe) will eventually die and you won't be there for her when she does if this goes on any longer. Let her live whatever's left of her life in fucking peace, surrounded by her friends and family. This is beyond cruel and is straight up elder abuse now.</p>
<p>Children are having their childhoods destroyed and their futures are disintegrating right before their eyes. Do not vaccinate them, there is no fucking need, it is more risky to give them the jab than it is to let them get the virus. FUCKING FACT.</p>
<p>The unvaccinated should not be treated any differently. If you are vaccinated you should feel and be safe. Otherwise what is the fucking point in getting vaccinated in the first place? Like I said, wear a fucking chin-cushion if you want, be my fucking guest, just don't expect anyone else to do the same.</p>
<p>Got it? Good. Let's get back to fucking normal, shall we?</p></p>

        <p>To be reviewed in September with vaccine passports to be required. It’s certainly not going back to normal for anyone who does not get the jab. That will quickly spread to everywhere forcing everyone to have the vaccine or not go out. It’s clever by the government, they’re making it look like we’re opening up but sadly it’s not gonna be much better than what we have now just another means to push the agenda to the next stage. Lockdown by Winter I reckon.</p>

<p>And it’s this bullshit that makes me laugh. No, fuck off, if you end the legal requirement there is no expectation otherwise you yourself are breaking the law by forcing somebody to do something against their will. </p>
<p>It is "expected and recommended" people wear face coverings in crowded indoor settings unless they are exempt.</p>

        <p>the thing i don't get on this sub; not leaving the house DOES effect my life.  even (some) antivaxers have their reasons to doubt statistics.  but wearing a mask literally doesn't impact your life at all?  in what way is that not living?  i think some people forget that anxiety is a fucking condition just as much as covid is.  call people stupid for hiding from it, but don't call them stupid for wearing a mask, if that's the only thing that gives them security in living a normal life.  people have their reasons for being scared of the virus, and i assure you, some of them are far better than the 'this is a dystopian it's so tragic i have to put a piece of cloth over my face :(' attitude some people have on this sub.</p>

        <p>&rt; i think some people forget that anxiety is a fucking condition just as much as covid is.</p>
<p>Being forced to wear a mask and take an experimental vaccine gives me anxiety.</p>

<p>That's exactly what it is, well done.</p>
<p>&rt; stop acting like your inability to follow simple advice and use your brain is as serious as an actual mental condition.</p>
<p>Ah, so because my anxiety doesn't line up with your beliefs or your anxiety, my anxiety can go fuck itself?</p>
<p>The virus has a 99.9% survival rate for the overwhelming majority of the population. YOU suck it up and stop expecting others to cater to your, as you called it, "mental condition".</p>

<p>Riiiiighht, the widespread psychological damage of hypochondriac idiots was caused by me flashing my pearly whites at a stranger rather than the government telling everyone to act sick until they say otherwise.</p>

        <p>Yo I honestly feel for you and get where you're coming from. If you want to wear a mask that's fine, the OP is coming from a place of pain and anger and is lashing out. All we ask is that you don't judge us for not following covid restrictions. The whole "judge people who wear masks" thing is because you guys ostracize the fuck out of us for not wearing a mask or getting vaccinated</p>
