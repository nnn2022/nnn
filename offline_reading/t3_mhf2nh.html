    <strong>Any San Antonio locals here? How is it right now?</strong>
    <p><p>In terms of forced mask wearing and such. Considering moving to Texas. If I could I wouldn't live in the city, but I'm worried about being able to find a job, so not ruling the city out just yet.</p></p>

        <p>In the bigger cities in Texas (Dallas, San Antonio, Austin, Houston) you really can’t tell a difference between themselves and California, for example. Which is sad because they were once nice cities. Not much has changed in terms of mask culture — everyone is wearing them voluntarily and businesses all requiring them. Though, you may want to look in the more rural sides of San Antonio, as the culture is totally different.</p>

        <p>Yeah, that's pretty much how I figured it to be. It's the same where I am now. Rural is red, cities blue. Saw another post on here about someone in San Antonio saying they were able to go to the movies normally, so figured I'd at least see if anything's looking up there. Like if the culture there is pretty chill about non-maskers or something. Where I live now is rural and that's why I haven't been able to find a job. Type of town where it's industrial type jobs only, heavy lifting and construction. I have just gotten my college degree. So that's my current dilemma with where to live. Feels like I have to sacrifice normality just to be able to work somewhere besides a grocery store.</p>

        <p>Can't speak for SA, but in the Austin area things aren't too bad as long as you stay out of the central part of the city. HEB doesn't make a fuss when you walk in without a mask. Same with Home Depot and Walmart. Smaller places are hit or miss but generally the further out you go, the more relaxed it is.</p>

        <p>Oh, that's interesting to hear! That's basically what I'm going for at this point. I just want to live my life without people hassling me.</p>

        <p>I've worked a couple of times in San Antonio recently and I heard they were masks NAZI'S down there but everywhere I went I didn't wear a mask and no one fucked with me. I'm from Austin and still live in the area in Round Rock. Round Rock is pretty chill about masks except Costco and Half Priced Books. Round Rock has a pretty high mask compliance ironically. Austin is hit or miss on the outskirts and absolute hell in downtown central. Brace yourself for the large homeless encampments under nearly every bridge and over pass though when your cruising the ATX.</p>

        <p>Not from there. But I have been to Sea World numerous times and San Antonio is a great city. Love it.</p>

        <p>It looks really cool there. I'm very drawn to the hill country areas around there.</p>
