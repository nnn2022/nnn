    <strong>Seeing people celebrate the harassment of a Church is disturbing</strong>
    <p><p>I live in Edmonton so this has been in the news constantly.</p>
<p>It's honestly quite disturbing to see people celebrate the harassment of GraceLife church as if it was solely responsible for the Covid outbreak.</p>
<p>Edmonton is a city with a huge Ukrainian/Polish population and the province was essentially built on very traditionalist Christian/Catholic values from a shitload of immigrants moving out west. We are basically here today and thriving because our grandparents and great grandparents busted their asses for six days a week, then went to church on the seventh to unwind. There are churches fucking everywhere here.</p>
<p>Not only was this church not doing anything morally wrong, nothing suggests that they were responsible for any sort of covid outbreak beyond the accidental "whoops, there were probably 2 or 3 people here who caught the WuFlu." </p>
<p>This incident has now become a vessel for anyone even remotely clinging to their edgy atheist phase, to hurl insults at the church and at religion in general - a religion that A) built the province and B) generally provides people with a pretty good moral code to live by. </p>
<p>This church has not killed anyone and mathematically has contributed very little to the spread of C-19 in Alberta, a province that has a laughably low death total of just 2,000 in the past year. And it has triggered the angsty teenage atheist inside 50% of the population to write the most insane, disrespectful things on social media that you would otherwise never write about <em>any</em> place of worship.</p>
<p>I'm not a practicing catholic, nor are my parents, but I feel almost a wave of second hand anger for my grandparents. In some ways I'm almost glad my grandma wasn't alive to see this.</p></p>

        <p>Central Albertan currently living in Calgary now. Although growing up I never was religious, this man who stood up and took a stand against this authoritarianism currently gripping the world has me supporting him and his cause 100%. This shouldn't be a left vs right, religious vs non-religious issue. People should realize what is at stake and stand up to this tyranny in any way we can before it is too late. I just hope enough wake up to realize in time.</p>

        <p>It is even more interesting to think that police and public health officials are breaking the law going in a church while it is active. /<em>Criminal Code Section 176-(2).</em></p>
<p>The fact people are ok with anyone, included Alberta Health breaking the law like this is absurd to the highest degree. I should stress no where in Canada law are mask, social distancing are any other outrageous lockdown measure accepted. In fact most of restrictions in Canada go against out own Charter of Rights and Freedoms and our Bill of Rights.</p>

        <p>Churches, or most churches, not only give a moral code to live by but also do a great deal of good in their local communities. The church I attend has a benevolence fund that is set aside for people who fall on hard times. People come to the church with water and light bills that are overdue or simply need $20 for groceries. </p>
<p>Atheists hate to admit how much benefit churches provide in local communities, as well as abroad. Samaritan’s Purse does a great deal of good in the world. They went into Libya during Ebola, an actual deadly disease. They also responded to covid in New York, until the state ran them out once they felt they weren’t need any longer. </p>
<p>Plenty of criticism to go around in the realm of religion, but to ignore the good that is accomplished through local churches is just ridiculous.</p>

        <p>That pastor made me WANT to go to church! My mother is Methodist and they follow all the covid rules, and would never send cops away. They don't do much for their community and I never really understood why anyone was religous. I was actually crying as I watched that (Pregnant lol!) Recently it seems like the conservative/religous people are the ones with their heads on right.</p>

        <p>Statheists are the most fervent believers of all. At least when a religious person comes to my door and rails on about the punishment I will receive for failing to abide their code I can just shut the door in their face and that's that.

        <p>I can’t begin to tell you how happy and absolutely euphoric some of the older folks at my congregation were when we were able to open up again. And after a year of recording video with my pastor, I can tell how much he needed to preach in front of a live crowd again. </p>

        <p>OP, I am not familiar with Canadian history, but wasn't Canada in part migrated to for religious freedom like America? I mean, religious freedom, at least here in America, is a hallmark in which we were settled and founded on. Can the same be said about Canada or am I missing something?</p>

        <p>I'm in Edmonton too. Grace Life is a household name now, its been in the news so much.  I was amazed AHS actually fenced it in  like its been condemned.  Just another scapegoat, I guess. Finger pointing is rampant lately.</p>
