        <p>I love how the article starts off by talking about Sweden's COVID "experiment". The "experiment" being literally staying sane and normal and doing what we have done for every single pandemic in history. These authors/"journalists" can fuck right off.</p>

        <p>Yeah. Sweden is not the experiment. It's the rest of the world that's the experiment. Because never in any pandemic were people forced to wear masks, not visit relatives, not allowed to do community gatherings, and kept from travelling far from home.</p>

        <p>The "experiment" being literally staying sane and normal and doing what we have done for every single pandemic in history." I study history a lot but I can't comment on this specific topic, however, as a Swedish guy I can tell you that if anything we're the exception. At this point some other countries have changed their minds and opened up more but at the beginning we were literally the only country to opt for this approach, so your point of us doing what's normal is pretty mute.</p>
<p>You also need to keep in mind that a lot of things go into determining how successful a country's approach is in mitigating spread of disease. It's not only about the official measures in place, it also has a lot to do with culture. I've been to a few places in the US and generally speaking people are much less closed off and more open to social interaction. In Sweden our default is to just stay the f away from other people, that combined with Sweden in general being a much more hemogonistic society where EVERYONE keeps distance when told to do so and our lower population density it's not weird that we're relatively well off now.</p>
<p>Also, stop talking for me. I'm so sick of every American who's anti-lockdown using my country as an example without even understanding the situation here. If you want to make a anti-lockdown argument that's well researched, I aplaud you, I'm not against people being anti-lockdown at all, I'm just against you using my country's situation to prove your point when you don't actually understand it.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry you don't like your country being used, but your arguments against it are not great either.  Swedish people being a bit antisocial is in no way the same as 'everyone stay in your house and don't see another soul while we shutdown all bars, restaurants and cafes'.  I'm sorry, but it just isn't and it's silly to compare the two.  I saw pictures from back in April of packed bars in Stockholm.  From the same perspective as you, you have no idea what it was like living under a lockdown for months because you never had one, but it is not the same as what Swedes do 'naturally'.</p>
<p>Yes, there are a ton of things that determine the outcomes and my personal opinion is that literally nothing any country did made any difference to the mortality outcome, but then that is why Sweden is used as the example, because at least the restrictions were relatively relaxed.  If nothing any country does makes a difference, why do anything at all? Compare Sweden to Quebec, that had harsh lockdowns, closed down everything, has an even lower population density than Sweden and yet had a worse mortality rate. </p>
<p>I mean, Tegnell is right there participating in debates on the anti-lockdown side in international media, so don't be upset that we then use the same arguments the architect of the Swedish strategy is using.  He and Giesecke have literally said the same thing the person you replied to said, that they consider what they did normal and the other countries the experiment, so why don't you go yell at them as well?</p>

        <p>Let's assume my perspective is warped. Even then the notion of sweden doing the same thing as everyone else is just flat out wrong. Nobody's really had the same response as us. So yeah, when literally everyone other than us use a different approach that's usually somewhat similar I think it's safe to call us the experiment. I went a bit off track but this was the core of my argument.</p>

        <p>So, having a normal standard approach with new measures such as restricting crowd sizes and indoor gatherings and enacting social distancing is the "experiment"/"gamble"  </p>
<p>But nations deciding to shut down the entirety of society, entire supply chains, entire industries decimated and then printing money like mad while also denying care to many younger people with years of life ahead of them (lack of cancer treatments, chemotherapy paused in many cases), no safeguarding of children, millions of children not educated, millions of jobs lost, all banking on the idea that a magical vaccine will come in months, instead of years or a decade... That is somehow not the gamble. Oh and deaths and hospitalisations are basically fact and the vaccines are "non-sterilising", they just reduce symptoms, we will still have cases. So again, we will be in a similar situation after the vaccine.  </p>
<p>How is option 2, western nations deciding to copy China and playing right into their disinformation campaign not the gamble and having standard protocols with proportionate new measures is the gamble??  </p>
<p>I seriously don't get how you cannot see that.</p>

        <p>You very clearly don't know much about Sweden. For a very long time we ranked #5 in terms of death per capita in the entire world. We are now about #5. When Norway and finland had hundreds of deaths we had thousands, even when correcting for population A LOT more died in Sweden, as in like, 5000 in Sweden vs 250-300 in Norway, so even when adjusting for population we had 10x the amounts of deaths. </p>
<p>Everyone pretends like Sweden's this big success, and whilst yes, recently we had VERY few cases, we are now seeing a surge in cases, once again. <strong>Sweden was absolutely shit on for most of this year until our cases became low and then everyone used us as an example of success without lockdown</strong>. Stop using data when it suits you and ignore it when it doesn't. Seeing as we're having a surge of cases I suggest you wait 2 weeks and then come back and tell me my country's doing great.</p>
<p>Also, what do you mean by the " western nations deciding to copy China and playing right into their disinformation campaign"" part?</p>

<p>hhahahahaha, see you in 2022 bro when your type will still be saying "just wait two weeks" as you have been saying since May. I remember when people of your stripe called Georgia "human sacrifice" in the Atlantic, meanwhile places like Georgia, South Dakota and FLorida still do much better than New York on the whole.  </p>
<p>You're destroying entire nations and regions. Many Nobel Laureates and professors from places like Oxford have pointd out all the folly going on.  </p>
<p>You are literally screaming over positive PCR tests that may only be picking up viral fragments after several cycles, the death curve is FLAT in Sweden, it's flat almost everywhere. It's over!  </p>
<p>It's just a 'casedemic' at this point like the H1n1 panic spoken of in Der Spiegels in depth analysis.  </p>
<p>But seriously HAHAHAA, I'm sorry if you were trolling. I can't believe you went with the "just wait in two weeks!" so you people are a joke a this point.  </p>
<p>I just hope you lose your job and livelihood and ability to support yourself before others around you when the government have stopped printing money, 1000s are applying for the same shit job and austerity and tightening up kicks in.  </p>
<p>Good luck out their boyo!</p>

        <p>2 weeks came early! Already after a few days you can see a huge peak slighly bigger than the first one in June: <a href="https://gyazo.com/5ce126fc666bfb9dfd359dc612863f31">https://gyazo.com/5ce126fc666bfb9dfd359dc612863f31</a>. And don't tell me "Case surge, not death surge" because we both know it takes several weeks to die from Covid. Also, stop being under the illusion that the only bad thing that can happen as a result of Covid is death. Plenty of people deal with kidney, lung damage, and long term symptoms even after the infection itself is gone. If you want to talk about jobs then maybe stop pretending everyone is fine after their infection, plenty of people can't walk normally or run for months due to their fuck up lungs.    </p>

        <p>Point taken, but while we in the UK don't have the low population density, we generally at least think of ourselves as a 'personal space' sort of culture, and during lockdown we became a 'veer dramatically away from anyone who gets near' one. It'd be possible to argue the north -I live there- being less like that is causing more issues now, but I think it was just a question of time for covid to hit us more than anything. France is lower population density, but has a population who have insisted on continuing to faire la bise -the cheek kissing- through this, and are at a similar place to us. I could see that Sweden might be a special case, but, it's a virus, and I'm not sure a lot of the impact isn't sheer good/bad luck, no matter what anyone does or doesn't do.</p>

        <p>I don't know why this is being downvoted. As much as I appreciate Sweden's response to this, I think the argument is really old and overused, kind of like the idea that "communists should go to Venezuela to see what real communism is like". Both arguments seem to take the good or bad things about each country and elevate them so highly as to make those the only defining characteristics of both countries.</p>
<p>To add upon the point you made that Swedes do not get as close to each other as those in other countries might, I live in a really sparsely-populated state in the U.S., and while our state has effectively mandated mask wearing, we still stand as an outlier among the rest of the states during this pandemic. I believe the worst case scenario we've had in our country thus far is about a thousand cases state-wide out of a population of 1.3 million, and even then, it was localized mostly within one urban county.</p>
<p>I think one of the biggest reasons that our state is such an outlier is because of how sparsely-populated our state is and how we, too, don't like getting in people's faces when we talk. That's just a part of how our state operates. That's not to say that those who get in the faces of others when they talk, for instance, are inhumane for doing so. They're just more confrontational than us, and all that means with regards to this virus is that they might spread this virus quicker than we will just by going about their daily routine.</p>
<p>I still think these lockdowns and forced mask mandates where I am are pretty overexaggerated, but I agree that things like culture and geography play a pretty big part in determining how far this virus, or, really, anything, spreads.</p>

        <p>I'm personally not decided on if I'm pro or anti lockdown, I just came to this sub to get the perspective of the anti-lockdown side of the argument. It shouldn't surprise me but this is a very "group think-y" sub, even when compared to the rest of Reddit. </p>
<p>Sadly <em>some</em> people on the right such as on here don't see the hypocrisy of how they act. They complain about how the left doesn't care about facts, only feelings, but then they procceed to do the exact same thing. They complain about the left being offended, then they get offended when anyone disagrees. They complain that the left are in an echo chamber, then they create their own. </p>
<p>I'd be perfectly happy if people responded the way you did if they disagree, but instead it's a lot of scripted lines that they memorized as part of their argument, and very little actual free thinking, which is incredibly ironic.</p>

        <p>I understand that. I'm usually sympathetic towards those who hate these lockdowns and want them gone already, because I'm one of those people. I certainly don't think it's helping us, however, when people start bringing the same tired statements about the Chinese Communist Party, and the analogies between now and Orwell's 1984, and how we're all participating in "wrongthink". It's so old and overused at this point. I appreciate the enthusiasm and I understand what it's referencing, but it really doesn't help eliminate the stereotype that we're all a bunch of crackpot conspiracy theorists when we use the same language as them.</p>
<p>I mainly have come to enjoy and appreciate the perspective of those within this subreddit because it dares to suggest that the lockdowns and mask wearing is unnecessary. I agree and think they've done a lot of harm, but I think the situation is a lot more temporary than people make it out to be. If there is some "new world order" emerging, I don't see it; the most I've ever seen is pushing forward the idea of a "new normal", which I am vehemently opposed to.</p>
<p>I mostly joined this subreddit because the majority of Reddit seemed to go along with complete shutdown compliance and mask-wearing the second it became normalized by the CDC and WHO, among other organizations. What I specifically came here to avoid, however, was the same tired old freakouts from Reddit and the language used therein. All this talk about how we should "wear our damn masks" and "socially distance" and "quarantine" and how we're "killing grandma" makes me sicker than this virus ever will. What I didn't come here for was to be dissuaded from one pretentious, predictable way of talking and introduced to another. That just makes me feel like I'm playing into the hands of my ideological opponents on this matter, or giving them more ammo to dismiss my position as the ramblings of some lunatic.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to say is that I enjoy someone who can speak for themselves, someone who strives to be original even if their viewpoints aren't, and the sort of language and terminology used by some on here is used in a similar manner to how the pro-lockdown crowd on Reddit uses its terminology. I think you'll find, however, that there are a lot of people on here like me who aren't interested in reiterating the same statements about "groupthink" and "dystopia" and just happen to hold the position that these lockdowns are more destructive than the virus ever will be.</p>
