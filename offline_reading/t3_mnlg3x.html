    <strong>I don’t want the vaccine and my family is judging me because I don’t want it.</strong>
    <p><p>My mom called me this morning and told me that I had an appointment today to get the vaccine and I told her that I wasn’t ready to get it and I wasn’t sure how I felt about it. While we were talking on the phone she said “ well it may not be 100% safe but I’m willing to try anything to prevent getting corona “ why are you willing to take something that’s not 100% safe ? And then my grandmother called me and asked me why I didn’t want to get the vaccine and I told her that I I wasn’t ready to get it yet.  I really don’t want to get it because I believe that the vaccine is rushed and there hasn’t been enough testing done on the vaccine before it was released. I also heard stories of people dying after getting vaccinated and some people had allergic reactions.</p></p>

        <p>You can show them VAERS data to see reported incidences of death ano other side effects.    https://vaers.hhs.gov/data.html</p>
<p>It is your body.   No one else has to live with the consequences of what is done to it.   If your body is damaged, there is no recourse.  No undo.  In the case of these mRNA shots, you can't even sue anyone.   </p>
<p>My body was damaged from 3 pills of Cipro in December of last year.   4 months later, I am just now starting to be able to walk normally again.   I may never fully recover.</p>
<p>Covid has a 99.95% survival rate for people under the age of 70.  I have no idea what the chances are for damage from the mRNA shots - I don't think anyone does.</p>
<p>Make your choice.</p>

        <p>Did you read the part of the disclaimer that says “VAERS reports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness.”? And do you know why that’s significant?</p>

        <p>Like the disclaimer about how the cdc counts covid deaths? 
Presumed covid=covid death (no test required)
Died within 28 days of positive test=covid death(even if it was car wreck or anything else)</p>

        <p>What is incredibly irritating is that somehow your choice to get the vaccine has become everyone else's business. Never before has your vaccination choices become something that was up for public discussion. It's your body and your individual and personal health, and what you decide to do is NOBODYS fucking business!!! Its not up for discussion, period! Everything about this has me absolutely at my wits end with people, its like they want you to explode at them. If one more person asks me "Are you getting the vaccine?" I swear to God I might start attacking people. Just like the rest of my medical history and information...its NONE of your business and PLEASE fuck right off!!!</p>

        <p>Part of life involves being judged for your decisions and being okay with that, even from friends or family.  People won't always like the decisions you make, and will try to coerce you through argument, force, or guilt.  Listen to reason, weigh arguments, fight force, shun guilt.  In the end it's your decision (as long as you're old enough, my 3yo eats his vegetables whether he wants to or not).</p>

        <p>First and foremost, unless you have some contractual obligations that defines you MUST do as they say regarding your body, tell them to go kick rocks.</p>
<p>It doesn't mean to be disrespectful, but simply being firm on your stance, that you appreciate their concerns, however, you will not take the vaccine at this time, and that any future discussions are off the table. Keep it simple, terse and to the point.</p>

        <p>&rt; why are you willing to take something that’s not 100% safe ?</p>
<p>Because adults realize they have to make decisions based on risk versus benefit. </p>
<p>Essentially nothing is 100% safe. Getting in the car and driving down the street comes with a real (albeit small) safety risk. People choose to do it because they feel the benefit outweighs the risk. </p>
<p>So presumably your mother decided that the benefits of getting vaccinated (reduced risk of being harmed by the virus, being able to live more normally, etc) outweighed the risks of doing so (short-term pain / discomfort, potential serious side effects that are extremely rare).</p>

        <p>It's a misconception that the vaccine was rushed.</p>
<p>It was not rushed, it was prioritized. It went through all necessary testing, just compared to normal medicine it didn't have to wait endlessly between phases but could go from one to the next and got all the resources it needs to get tested as fast as possible.</p>
<p>it is an emergency response to an emergency situation.</p>
