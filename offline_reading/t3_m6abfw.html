        <p>It’s not far fetched to draw 2 conclusions from these numbers. First, is that masks don’t result in better outcomes. And second, lockdowns and other Covid restrictions in general don’t result in better outcomes.</p>

        <p>Does it have to be the lowest for it to have been a better outcome though? The Dakotas never had restrictions and have a way higher death rate than a state with 50x their population. No covid restrictictions definitely resulted in worse outcomes</p>

        <p>New york had an explosion of cases/deaths before the rest of the country even had a few. They didn’t lockdown fast enough and started reopening after only a month. So yes...lack of restrictions made it worse. Not to mention millions of people in new york and california ignored the restrictions anyway.</p>

        <p>Another point to consider Florida has 4.4 million residents age 65 and older. California has less that 2 million</p>
<p>If masks, lockdowns, and social distancing worked, California should have far fewer COVID-19 deaths than Florida.</p>

        <p>I checked and CA actually has 3.6 million people over 65 however that’s still equivalent to 1.98 million compared to 4.4 million in Florida based on Florida’s population. That means Florida has 2.2 times as many elderly people per capita than CA. </p>
<p>Given the vast majority of deaths are in people over 65, Florida should be expected to have almost twice as many deaths per capita compared to CA assuming equal covid responses. </p>
<p>The fact they’ve ended up with almost the same numbers is downright astounding, and probably means Florida did a great job of protecting its elderly while letting the virus run through all the younger people, exactly the definition of focused protection, via heterogeneity.</p>

        <p>&rt; The database includes cases and deaths that have been identified by public health officials as probable coronavirus patients, which means they did not have confirmed tests for coronavirus infection but were evaluated using criteria developed by national and local governments.</p>
<p>Moreover, there’s a fair chance that the number of cases and deaths have been overstated as they are adding “probable” coronavirus cases and deaths rather than only using confirmed cases and deaths.</p>

I know this isn’t true bc I saw near 100% compliance in public places I went. People screamed for the mandate, then screamed about lack of compliance/enforcement.

        <p>I realized that mask mandates don't really correlate to death rates, instead should correlate to infection rates. The claim isn't that masks are stopping deaths, but that they are supposed to stop the spread.   </p>
<p>When you look at the top 25 top states with the lowest number of infection rates, there is a very real correlation. 92% of the states with the lowest infection rates have mask mandates and covid restrictions. The only states that do not are Florida and Alaska (which has an extremely low population and population density), but they are the exception, not the rule. The top fourteen states with the lowest infection rates all have mandates and restrictions.   </p>
<p>For the bottom 25 states, with the highest number of infection rates, only 11 states have mask mandates and restrictions - 44%. Only 3 out of the 10 states(30%)  with the highest infection rates in the country have mask mandates and restrictions.  </p>
<p>So yeah, it does seem like mask mandates and covid restrictions do slow the spread of covid-19 after all.   </p>

        <p>The problem is that you can't accurately compare case rates between states because testing rates and methodologies vary wildly from state to state. You take 2 states like Washington and Utah. Utah has a testing rate nearly double Washington's, so Utah's cases are much higher, but is that because the virus is actually spreading more, or is it because Utah is just detecting more due to more testing? If you look at the case counts in Utah <a href="https://coronavirus.utah.gov/case-counts/">https://coronavirus.utah.gov/case-counts/</a>, there is an obvious correlation between positive tests and total tests performed. And what is considered a "case" isn't a consistent metric either. Is it a false positive? Is it even laboratory confirmed or just assumed? To jump to conclusions about cases based on case number data is very problematic, and then to compare those conclusions to other states compounds the problem. And then to assign causes like mask wearing to those already weak conclusions is very troubling. You are making conclusions based on very bad assumptions.</p>

        <p>easy.  mask mandates doesn't mean people actually will wear masks.  you need to look at mask wearing rates.  for example SD never had a mandate and ND did, but the mask wearing rate was equal and so was the death rate.  you could look at the data and say "the mandate does not correlate with reduced death rate" which is accurate, but it speaks nothing to the effectiveness of masks.  second, not every state experienced the same initial viral load.  new york, being an international hub of travel, will invariably get more deaths per capita than some flyover state because way way way more viral particles were introduced into those regions.  in order for the numbers in this "scientific publication" to mean anything they need to be normalized to the viral load that each state experienced.  if new york experienced 100 times the virion particles per capita as wyoming, for example, then looking at death rate between the two states is not an apples-apples comparison.</p>
<p>masks don't offer immunity, but they do provide a physical barrier for viral particles to be dispersed which is the means by which the virus spreads.  it doesn't take a rocket surgeon to recognize how dampening the means of viral spread will reduce infection rates, all else equal.</p>
<p>in countries where people cared about their fellow countrymen (NZ) or were forced to care (CHINA) they were able to stamp out the virus with robust mask-wearing, social distancing, and tracking of spread.  in countries where citizens don't care about their fellow countrymen, the virus is still killing hundreds to thousands per day.  countries have shown the ability to stop the spread and masks are a part of that equation.  not the silver bullet by any means, but certainly an element.  america never had a chance at stopping the spread because there's too many self-rightous assholes here.  if everyone was on board with giving a fuck in america we could've prevented 10s if not 100s of thousands of deaths.  but we can't even be arsed to wear a lil cloth over our mouths, something that the succesful countries didn't seem to have a problem with doing.  </p>
<p>at the end of the day mask usage is an easy cost-benefit win.  the cost is incredibly low and benefit is a high probability at marginally reducing transmission, which has large-scale effects.</p>
<p>edit: to those that have responded please be patient and i will reply.  mods have put me on a timer so i must now wait 15 minutes between making comments.  i thought this sub would be a good place to have unrestricted conversation where we could speak freely but that does not appear to be the case unfortunately.  please do not downvote me just because my post makes you feel uncomfortable as this will increase my timer -- i'm simply trying to have a conversation and have no ill-intent.</p>

        <p>I agree with the first half of your comment about mandates vs. actual mask wearing. We can’t make assumptions based solely on the mandate stats. You mentioned NZ and China being able to stomp out the disease quick because mask wearing, but literally everywhere I go I see masked people, I’m almost always the only one not wearing a mask. I disagree with the idea that no one wears a mask in the USA, and THAT is the reason why we still ha e the virus around.</p>

        <p>few things -- your personal experience is not representative of all of the united states.   early in the pandemic the mask-wearing rate was something like 40% on average, with about 50% wearing them in urban/suburban areas and 20% in rural.  this is empirical information.  this trend was persistent for several months as the virus was downplayed and we were yet to feel the consequences of our actions (or inactions) despite seeing what was happening to other countries hit hard early on.  mask usage has gone up since then, but to counter with another anecdote, i was at a bar last weekend in a state with above average death rate -- i was drinking outside with my partner who has received the vaccine -- the bar inside was PACKED with people who were there for hours.  no one was wearing a mask.  considering our case numbers, kiwis and chinese folk alike would be APALLED at this type of behavior.  this is the type of behavior that lets our country be a major incubation site for the virus and it has been consistent throughout the pandemic.  it really is a case of bad apples spoiling the batch.  we needed to ALL be one board with fighting the virus, yet our leadership turned it into a divisive political issue.  truly sad.  literally thousands and thousands of lives could have been saved if we weren't such trash people.</p>
<p>second -- please re-read my original comment.  i did not say NZ and china were able to stomp out the disease quick "because of mask wearing".  i said it was a FACTOR.  THERE IS NO SILVER BULLET AND EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS.  i specifically hedged the claim, by introducing other FACTORS like social distancing and contact tracing -- all measures which have been absolute disasters in the US because we're all a bunch of self-interested clowns.  all mitigating measures took forever to take off due to atrocious planning by our officials and by that time the virus had already ravaged the country.</p>
<p>the countries that succeeded in combating the virus listened to their scientists and acted quickly and decisively with a centralized plan.  they were the first countries to adopt widespread mask usage among other mitigating measures.  meanwhile in the states we were debating whether or not the virus was even real, downplayed it, etc etc.  we've utterly failed as a country to do what we could to fight the virus and so now are relying strictly on the vaccine to save us.  i hope it works out.  unfortunately, our refusal to change our collective behavior, leading to massive spread of the virus, has increased the chances of a variant being generated that could render all of our current vaccines useless and we'll be back to square one.</p>

        <p>I haven't seen those mask-wearing stats before, and I assume they are self-reported. Do you have a link to that?</p>
<p>50% in urban areas does not seem right to me. I have never seen an unmasked person in a business to date and I live in a large metro area.</p>

<p>Masks are not low cost, high benefit. An entire society of people wearing masks for an entire year has serious social effects, and a very marginal benefit in terms of prevention. If your policy requires literally everyone to do exactly as you say by force for an entire year in order to work, it’s probably not a very good policy</p>

        <p>&rt; NZ is a small island of a few million people that can easily close its borders. China LIED about its numbers, fooled the WHO, and jailed dissenters.</p>
<p>the US permitted travel between US and China for a month after first hearing of the outbreak and even after implementing the travel ban (that was NOT opposed by gov officials as the former pres claims) still permitted US citizens to travel to and fro china for months.  at the same time there were ZERO screening procedures in place for international travelers.  this complete and utter failure from our officials helped to plant the seed of infection all across our country that has since ravaged us.  sure it might have overall easier for NZ to deal with the spread, but they did act quickly and decisively -- they did what needed to be done, informed by their scientific community.  the same cannot be said for the US -- it was a disaster.  i don't see any objective reason why you would disagree.</p>
<p>and you can say china is lying all you want but that doesn't make it true. china has done WAY better than the US by any objective measure.  if telling yourself that china is lying makes you feel better than by all means carry on, but that doesn't make the lie that you tell yourself true i'm sorry to say.  let me know if you ever want to come back to reality and i'll be happy to discuss potential reasons WHY china has done better.  but if you want to live in fictional world then i don't see how we can have a conversation.</p>
<p>&rt; Masks are not low cost, high benefit</p>
<p>i didn't say masks have "high benefit".  i said they have "high probability at <em>marginally</em> reducing transmission, which has large-scale effects."  marginally reducing viral load upon coughing has significant downstream effects including reducing possibility of infection as well as reducing severity of infection if infection occurs.  </p>
<p>i didn't say masks have ZERO cost.  but it is low.  do you have any empirical evidence to suggest that people wearing specifically a mask has "serious social effects" or is this conjecture from anti-maskers?  please show me a study that proves this and i'd happy to change my mind.  i wouldn't be surprised if there were statistically significant effects on mask wearing, but what is the net effect?  how many lives does mask-wearing cost?  does this outweigh the lives that could be saved if masks are worn?  i assume you believe masks have saved zero lives so i understand why you think the cost-benefit analysis doesn't work out.  but i think if you looked at the data out there objectively you'd reconsider your position.</p>
<p>&rt; If your policy requires literally everyone to do exactly as you say by force for an entire year in order to work, it’s probably not a very good policy</p>
<p>this is the kind of statement that confirms i'm dealing with someone who has a very distorted sense of logic.  it's truly meaningless.  try applying it to literally any other policy that requires people to "do as you say by force for an entire year in order to work" like the policy of ensuring drivers are licensed, or the policy that murder is illegal.  the fact that you could type out such a statement and think it makes sense is extremely troubling to me and i suggest you bow out now as you clearly are not capable of having a rational discussion.</p>

        <p>What would have been your approach to Covid if you were in control? Seems like 
A) You would have acted quickly &amp; decisively as you say and shut down travel, and ostensibly shut down all illegal border crossings from Mexico and Canada. The latter Trump campaigned on and was called a white supremecist for it, but if you’d have been willing to do it good for you. I agree we should have acted more decisively on travel
B) You’d have mandated mask wearing I assume - would people have to wear them outside? Would you impose fines? How long would the mandate last? 
C) You would have mandated lockdowns - who would be allowed to work? People have to have food, electricity, and have their basic needs met. Some parts of the economy have to be operating or else people die </p>
<p>When you consider these questions, you realize the only logical outcomes are to allow the virus to spread or to impose utter tyranny - which would you do?</p>
<p>Btw it’s an irrefutable point that the CCP lied about its numbers. Are you discrediting the stories of dissenters disappearing? Do you honestly think I’m a country of 1.4 bn people the virus started spreading then magically stopped? The virus spread to the world as a result of China’s ineptitude and corruption, making their response <em>the worst</em> when it came to Covid</p>

        <p>&rt; The latter Trump campaigned on and was called a white supremecist for it, but if you’d have been willing to do it good for you.</p>
<p>we're talking about the pandemic response, my friend.  not general illegal immigration policy -- but i do appreciate you attempting to detract from the point -- this signals to me that you're not actually interested in having a discussion so thank you for outing yourself.  and yes i would have shut down ALL travel from china immediately.  as far as trump's response to china travel, even though he CLAIMS he went against recommendations about restricting travel, this is a lie (can we really be surprised trump lies?)</p>
<p>"Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, who was coordinator of the task force at the time and announced the travel restrictions, said Trump made the decision in late January after accepting the “uniform recommendation of the career public health officials here at HHS.”'</p>
<p>and of course, this relatively weak action still permitted US citizens to freely travel to and from china for months as i've stated in previous comment.  the only people it banned were non-citizens.  how many deaths in the US can be traced back to this initial misstep, i wonder?</p>
<p>i can go through a list of all the things that would've done with 20-20 hindsight and construct a perfect pandemic response, but that's unfair as i already know how things played out.  the things i WOULDN'T have done is denigrate scientists who have spent their entire lives studying epidemiology.  i wouldn't have downplayed the seriousness of a virus that had ALREADY completely ravaged entire countries before our very eyes.  i wouldn't have driven a political wedge into a very real issue with very real consequences that REQUIRES us to work together.</p>
<p>&rt; When you consider these questions, you realize the only logical outcomes are to allow the virus to spread or to impose utter tyranny - which would you do?</p>
<p>no, those are not the only two options.  what a complete and utterly false premise.  i honestly worry about your sense of logic if you truly believe the quoted statement above.  there are countries that objectively did better than us without being outright tyrannical.  i also don't even entirely blame our government.  our people are awful too.  no american president would have fared well in responding to the pandemic, but at pretty much every point trump was doing the wrong thing (downplay, snake oil cures, political divisiveness, signal dangerous behavior, etc)</p>
<p>the best thing you can do in situations like this is to defer to the experts.  there are people who have been spending their entire lives preparing for moments like this.  new zealand did exactly that and they're way better off compared to us.  some people don't like the new zealand comparison because it admittedly is not an apples-apples situation.  maybe consider germany's response -- large population, major economic hub, major site of international travel -- they have a death rate that is HALF of what we have in the states.  did that happen from chance?  or did they respond better?  i don't remember hearing much about angela merkel screeching about how the virus is a conservative hoax.  i do remember hearing about how they had an exquisite contact tracing program.  if we had the death rate of germany we would've prevented 250 THOUSAND deaths.  a quarter of a million.</p>

        <p>There’s a huge problem with our “expert” class. If you followed the so called experts (e.g. Fauci, CDC, WHO) you would have at one point or another believed the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/who/status/1217043229427761152?lang=en">no person to person transmission of Covid </a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fauci-doesnt-regret-advising-against-masks-early-in-pandemic-2020-7">Don’t wear a mask</a></li>
<li>You should wear a mask</li>
<li>You should wear two masks</li>
<li>You need to maintain 6 feet of distance</li>
<li>Actually <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/03/15/977564878/cdc-looks-at-whether-3-feet-instead-of-6-is-safe-for-schools-social-distancing">3 feet</a> is fine</li>
<li>“2 weeks to slow the spread”</li>
<li>Wear masks until 2022</li>
<li>Make sure to wipe down surfaces </li>
<li>Actually the virus <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00251-4">doesn’t really stay on surfaces</a></li>
<li>We’ll have <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/12/15/946714505/fauci-predicts-u-s-could-see-signs-of-herd-immunity-by-late-march-or-early-april">herd immunity by April</a></li>
<li>Here immunity by <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/wgntv.com/news/fauci-predicts-open-season-on-vaccines-by-april-possible-herd-immunity-by-late-summer/amp/">late summer </a></li>
<li>People <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-doesnt-trust-trump-vaccines-1537331%3famp=1">shouldn’t trust Trump’s vaccine </a></li>
<li>Everyone needs to take the vaccine </li>
</ul>
<p>Our experts have been as indecisive, incompetent, and politically motivated as it’s possible to be. We deserve better experts </p>
<p>As far as a comparison with Europe, there are issues with making regional comparisons by death count. Different regions <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/52311014">count differently </a>. They also have different populations (more obesity in US, differences in age,...). The US also has a federalist approach and some states do better than others</p>
<p>Let’s assume you’re correct and Germany + other countries did better in terms of numbers. Even in that case, my top concern is people being free. The US is supposed to be the standard bearer in terms of individual rights, and I really hope it remains that way after Covid</p>

        <p>Nobody put you on a timer, when subreddits that don't normally hit the front page suddenly do, people begin getting restricted. This happens in all subreddits, not exclusive to our own. This is a reddit policy that we can't override.</p>

        <p>Lmfao i love how this is the correct response but it got downvoted to shit because this subreddit hates anyone with a brain who can apply thought to the question at hand. Literally every post on this subreddit has a few people disagreeing with OP and they ALWAYS get downvoted to hell. So much for being the subreddit of conversation and whatever other bullshit yall spew</p>
