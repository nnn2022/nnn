    <strong>How likely do you think they'll actually be able to restrict one's ability to work, buy, and sell without vaccine passports?</strong>
    <p><p>It's been a concern of mine because I have tried to make myself be happy by being grateful for what I have; but that just lead to a fear of everything I'm grateful for being taken away. I want to continue being able to live by just buying food instead of having to hunt every meal. I'm afraid that soon, all I'll have left is violence.</p></p>

        <p>It depends on how many people wake up and when. </p>
<p>If the majority believe that vaccine passports are a necessity, they will not be too difficult to implement.</p>

        <p>Without a QR code proving your vaccination status or negative pcr test result you will not be able to work, go to school, enter government buildings, go to the grocery store, exit the country, go to the gym, use public transportation, buy gas, use atm’s, conduct financial transactions, get a taxi, use Uber eats, or enter shopping malls, stores restaurants or movie theatres.. </p>
<p>The negative Pcr option will be slowly phased out and soon vaccination will be the only way to participate in society. </p>
<p>Not only that but if you commit any thoughtcrimes, such as making Facebook posts which circulate misinformation, attend unauthorized protests, display disruptive behavior or refuse to abide by the sanitary restrictions, your health pass may be suspended pending further investigation. </p>
<p>For minor thoughtcrimes your health pass will restrict you to financial transactions 5k and under, restrict you from exciting the country or flying, from buying gas more than once every 3 days, from going to sporting events and from being more than 100km from your residence. </p>
<p>For level 2 thoughtcrimes, you will be restricted to 50km from your residence, financial transaction under 1k, banned from public transportation and your health pass will allow you to enter only government buildings, grocery stores, hospitals and pharmacies. </p>
<p>If you commit a level 3 thoughtcrime you will be restricted to 30$ per day in purchases and if your health pass is scanned by law enforcement and you are found outside of your residence you will be subject to arrest. </p>
<p>Also, the government will start selling your health pass data to Zukerberg and Bezoz. They will track your every activity and pound you with advertisements. </p>
<p>In fact before flashing your health pass you will need to watch a YouTube style advert. Soon the facial detectors in the iPhone 15’s forward camera will pause the advert unless your eyes are open and directed towards the screen. Checkout lines will be full of zombies watching their mandatory Pfizer/BLM/Biden re-election advertisement, if they avert their gaze or close their eyes the ad will pause and they will not be able to scan their health pass to complete their purchase. </p>
<p>Also you won’t be able to turn your car on without scanning your health pass!</p>

        <p>Quite easily. Health departments could mandate that every business verify proof of vaccination before permitting entrance into their facility, similar to how bars currently have to verify someone is old enough to enter. </p>
<p>If a bar has too many instances of minors getting in, they lose their license and get shut down. They will do the same thing for businesses permitting unvaccinated people if we keep going down this road.</p>
<p>They might attach vaccination status to a preexisting document like a driver's license, or they could make a new one. Like driver's licenses, they would likely be scannable to ensure they aren't forgeries. The framework and legal powers are already there (at least in the US) to make this a thing very soon.</p>

        <p>You school look at some news articles about the Real ID debacle, specifically in Minnesota. I believe our DMV wasted over 140 million dollars on IDs. Now you are expected to link a health passport?!?! Not going to happen. Plus, if you are under 16, you don’t have an ID. </p>
<p>Who would pay for the new ID? I sure as shit won’t go wait in line. Reason IDs are good for 8 years is because the government can’t handle the capacity from a yearly ID.</p>

        <p>Well, that's just an example of how it could work. There are alot of different ways they could do it, with varying degrees of success. </p>
<p>I agree with you though - if they can't require an ID to cast a vote once every four years because so many people apparently don't have access to them, they're going to have a hard time getting people to have a brand new form of ID just to go to Walmart. </p>
<p>I hope you're right, and I hope that the nightmare of implementing it will keep it from happening.</p>

        <p>It is just not going to happen (in the US at least). While a gray area, many small to medium size companies will not take the HIPPA/ADA violation risk. Sure most companies will encourage it (like mine is already), but they cannot force it. </p>
<p>Also, think.... why are companies encouraging vaccination? To get their employees back in the office to be productive. Well, restrictions loosening and many getting the vaccine, this will die out. </p>
<p>Also, the logistics and cost for stores, restaurants, etc. to implement some sort of program (whether electronic or manual) would be too much. What if someone’s phone is dead. Will you deny entrance? What if they don’t have a cell phone? How can you guarantee their QR code the pull up is actually then? Is it the business’s job to check for fraud? </p>
<p>If the US had not rolled out license requirements to vote once every 4 years, they will not require this to purchase. </p>
<p>Now, I can see some private schools not requiring vaccination for students. You will see those schools have enrollment boosts and be successful whole public schools will continue to suffer. In Minnesota where I live, many private schools opened in fall and this spring. Imagine the advantage over public schools essentially being home schooled by their parents who are trying to work. We will see this affect for a long time. </p>
<p>Universities are starting to require it (Duke, Ivy leagues, etc.), but many less public universities because they know their enrollment will suffer and cause major budget issues. </p>
<p>The last thing America needs is forced segregation.</p>
