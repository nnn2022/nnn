        <p>In March, the news told me that I would have friends and relatives who died of COVID-19 by now. I freaked out about my dad. My aunt went to the hospital with it for a day and we were all freaked out. My coworker’s cousin died. </p>
<p>And then.......my aunt fully recovered within 2 weeks and started working out with a personal trainer. My dad, who has been working 80 hours a week as an essential worker through it all, hasn’t even coughed. My coworker’s life went on. Literally no one I know personally died. </p>
<p>My ex coworker’s pregnant grand daughter and daughter tested positive and they are freaking out. But the grand daughter has no symptoms and the daughter thought she just had seasonal allergies. </p>
<p>The virus is real and worse than the flu, but it’s not to the extreme levels that CNN keeps trying to push. It’s not worth destroying our world in hysteria over. I can’t believe that it’s considered controversial to say that I believe prolonged and repeated lockdowns will do more harm than the coronavirus.</p>

<p>Weird because I was thinking along the lines of, if we are going through such extreme measures for this threat, will we be able to understand to what extent we can further the response for a  threat of greater potential, if all solutions are being exhausted for the  less serious threat? </p>
<p>Also if spurious correlations such as "lockdowns/cases/deaths" continue to be counted as evidence for the less serious threat,  doesn't this set the precedent for the use of the same type of solutions in greater force, or more extreme solutions for a greater threat , that have the potential doing exponentially more harm then good? </p>
<p>So figuratively speaking, if we would cut our head off for a headache, then what is appropriate for a headache, ear ache and stiff shoulder, to cut our whole torso off?</p>

        <p>If it was real a few of your neighbors would drop dead on the sidewalk, you would hear constant sirens of emergency vehicles and everything would be closed and the national guard would be delivering food to your house.
Just ask everyone you see if they know anyone that had it and if they are ok. 
Some do get very sick but people of all ages have always gotten sick for one reason or another.</p>
