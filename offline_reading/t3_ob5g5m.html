    <strong>‘Huge red flag’: Medical researchers bury data showing 82% miscarriage rate in vaccinated women</strong>
    <p><p>I don't know why anyone would get jabbed, especially a pregnant woman. </p>

        <p>Lol at reading the paper. "Pregnant persons". If you want to talk about red flags, a medical journal unable to say the words "pregnant women" is a gigantic red flag of their bias, and immediately I am extremely skeptical of how they are going to try and report their data..</p>

        <p><em>Results: A total of 35,691 v-safe participants 16 to 54 years of age identified as pregnant. Injection-site pain was reported more frequently among pregnant persons than among nonpregnant women, whereas headache, myalgia, chills, and fever were reported less frequently. Among 3958 participants enrolled in the v-safe pregnancy registry, 827 had a completed pregnancy, of which 115 (13.9%) resulted in a pregnancy loss and 712 (86.1%) resulted in a live birth (mostly among participants with vaccination in the third trimester). Adverse neonatal outcomes included preterm birth (in 9.4%) and small size for gestational age (in 3.2%); no neonatal deaths were reported. Although not directly comparable, calculated proportions of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in persons vaccinated against Covid-19 who had a completed pregnancy were similar to incidences reported in studies involving pregnant women that were conducted before the Covid-19 pandemic. Among 221 pregnancy-related adverse events reported to the VAERS, the most frequently reported event was spontaneous abortion (46 cases).</em></p>

        <p>FYI - The headline is not even close to being accurate.  Please review the discussion linked below and then delete this post unless you have a reasoned rebuttal to the analysis.  The lifesitenews folks are just plain wrong and don't have a clue what they are looking at.  Error and disinformation needs to be corrected, not continued.  </p>

        <p>Since it is so clear, then it should be easy to point out and explain.  Please do.  </p>
<p>Or how about reading the article yourself and reading the comments in the other parallel discussion and then explaining how I am wrong.</p>
<p>If 82% of the 3958 pregnancies studied resulted in miscarriage, then why had only 827 of those pregnancies ended during the two month study period, of which only 104 were miscarriages.  Shouldn't the number of miscarriages be a lot closer 3000?  The fact that 3131 of the women were still pregnant at the end of the study should hopefully clue you in to the fact they didn't miscarry.</p>

        <p>Yeah, they were just earlier in their pregnant when the study started. Essentially, this is incomplete as the only ones they have birth data on are women who were later in pregnancy when they got the jab. I’ll be more interested in the results when those who got the jab in first/second trimester complete the pregnancy.</p>

        <p>Still waiting.  tumbleweed4life, your credibility is taking a real hit here.  Its okay to admit an error, especially when it was an honest mistake caused by misunderstanding a complicated medical study.  Your silence is telling.  The fact that lifesitenews has pulled its article to reevaluate should also give you pause.  Did you ever read the underlying article from the NEJM. It is here if you care to inform yourself:</p>

        <p>I am not going to argue with you. If you want to turn a blind eye to the truth, it is your choice.  You trying to manipulate me by imposing a false narrative of my "credibility" means nothing to me, because the truth is the truth, and whatever lies you want to tell don't change that no matter how many times you repeat them. </p>
<p>Do the math. This is a <strong><em>direct</em></strong> quote from the report:</p>
<p>"A total of 96 of 104 spontaneous abortions (92.3%) occurred before 13 weeks of gestation (Table 4)."</p>
<p>Also, an article being taken off a website means nothing. Censorship is real and it is everywhere.</p>

        <p>Tumbleweed, I don't think you read the study or looked at the data. The analysis of the article you shared is incorrect. They are only looking at data of completed pregnancies. If you look at table 3 you can see how many pregnancies actually existed (3126). This is the number in which the researchers are comparing the miscarriages. It's unlikely that a journalist or a random person on reddit is going to better understand a study than the researchers conducting it. This is why you should ALWAYS look at the study yourself and not just believe an article (that has actually been taken down).</p>
<p>Looking at the real data:<br>
3126  pregnant women were vaccinated in the study. 1,132 of those women were vaccinated in the first trimester. There were 96 miscarriages in the first trimester. That's a little over 8% of women vaccinated in the first trimester had a miscarriage in the first trimester. The other thousands of women were STILL PREGNANT and not included in the COMPLETED PREGNANCIES shown in table four. You need to look at table three to understand table four. <br>

        <p>Before believing random posts or articles, you need to always look at the study yourself and determine if the information shared is correct. In this case, the 82% miscarriage rate is NOT accurate. You can read the discussions above and READ THE STUDY YOURSELF - don't believe me. Just like you should not believe everything the government or CDC says, don't believe every article or reddit post you read. =)</p>

        <p>It's more than liberals man...
Grow up..
Let go of the politics. This is about a norwellian / dystopian Society that has been manipulated mainly by the mainstream media...
And I don't mean seeing bc, CNN are fox a huge amount of the people making these decisions are under 40 years old a huge amount of those people don't watch any of those TV shows...
You can't trust either side...
I can almost guarantee you that if the oompa loompa had won in 2020 we still would be dealing with a bad attempt at a mRNA vaccine...
If he had been against it then he shouldn't have rushed anything through think about the people behind the scenes that actually run our government until the administration's what they need to do fight against those people liberal and conservative...</p>
