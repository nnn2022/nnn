    <strong>Okay it‚Äôs time for the big guns</strong>
    <p><p>These are the 3 main reasons why I don‚Äôt believe this is a conspiracy </p>
<ol>
<li>Conspiracy: This would involve such ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù countries like the US, Russia, China, North Korea, Afghanistan, Iraq and more cooperating. If any of these countries wanted to show themselves as a country of truth why don‚Äôt you say that the others are lying. Also the lowball approximation of 150,000 hospitals and several worldwide organizations and lots of other medical adjacent jobs </li>
<li>The virus: it has a 2% death rate. If the goal  is to kill/scare people wouldn‚Äôt you want a more deadly/scary number meaning either A they found a virus in the wild and just built around that B they made it and didn‚Äôt have the death go more than 2% or C it‚Äôs just a virus </li>
<li>The vaccine: so they wanted to kill young people (shouldn‚Äôt the virus have done that) but I calculated a .003 death rate. Which is less deadly than COVID if you say 6 billion have it and only 1/10 of deaths connect to it .005 which is also making some extremely lowball guesses 
Those are the reasons this isn‚Äôt a conspiracy</li>
</ol></p>

<li>China 2 deaths in the last 8,000 cases, Singapore 32 deaths in 62k cases</li>
<li>It doesn't have a death rate of 2%, only a fool would think that. The WHO says there are three ranges of nations: 0.09%, 0.23% and 0.5%</li>
<li>You have no idea the death rate for the vaccine. BBC reported their own host as having died of "a short illness" at 44. Doctor in BC says his patients got severe adverse reactions, health authority said there is no evidence that vaccine cause injury and it will not be investigated. Many other deaths were called "natural" and yet they died very young shortly after taking the vaccine.</li>
</ol>
<p>Continuing point 3: average age of covid death is as old or older than life expectancy. From the vaccine, we are seeing far younger victims. Each vaccine victim's loss of years could equal 40 covid victims.</p>

        <p>I dont think it was a conspiracy either.</p>
<p>Heres how I think this all went down;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The covid virus was being studied in the lab in wuhan, partially paid for by US organizations. Something went wrong and it "escaped".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The CCP freaks out first, does all manner of authoritarian containment protocols while lying to the rest of the world so as to try to not look incompetent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It spreads to other countries, like Iran, Italy, and Spain, etc. These countries were not prepared because of china's misrepresentation. Rest of the world panics. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now many countries are trying to lock down, stop travel, and are trying to scare their population into compliance because they truly don't have a clue what this virus is like. They see estimation of millions of deaths per country and they believe it. And as one by one, their countries become infected, the panic only gets worse, as do the lockdown measures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Half a year in, the governments are realizing that their actions, mandates, and policies have been largely ineffective in stopping the spread none-the-less containing it. Countries like the US have created cash incentives for hospitals to report any and all deaths as covid. The policy of putting sick people into nursing homes was disasterous. Now the governments have to face the fact that they were either INEPT or IMPOTENT. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Actually, there is a third option; continue to play up the virus in order to justify all the lockdowns and mandates and stimulus, etc. That way, they look more like caring protectors instead of the useless impulsive busy bodies they are. </p>
<ol>
<li>As for the vaccine, well, it isnt just politicians that cant let a good catastrophe go to waste. The pharmaceutical companies know that they can make a vaccine that reduces symptoms easily with only somewhat rare side effects. They know that if they wait for case counts to start dropping (early 2021) they can claim the virus (that was starting to slow down due to natural immunity anyway) is going away due to their product, purchased by governments by the tunes of billions.</li>
</ol>
<p>FINAL POINT. </p>
<p>Please show any source from within the last half a year that claims the virus has a %2 mortality rate. I guarantee you wont find one.</p>

        <p>Australia locked down initially, closed international borders except for returning Australians who are made to quarantine in a quarantine hotel for 14 days and until tested negative and we‚Äôve kept Covid out.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre all back to living mostly normally and have been for almost a year now.</p>
<p>Every now and then you get an outbreak from a returned traveller (Melbourne is experiencing this right now) but we act quick and get on top of it.</p>
<p>It is possible to control. You just need the majority to comply... too many individualistic assholes in most other counties have acted selfishly and never allowed containment/quarantine/lockdown measures to work.</p>

        <p>You are just getting started. The rest if the world has already dealt with the inevitable, and your country has put it off via extreme and repeating lockdowns. Your best bet is that the vaccines are as reliable as they claim, but who knows. </p>
<p>So yes, you can lock people down, force people to stay in their homes, close businesses, etc until it goes away...until it comes back. Then do it again. And again. And again. </p>
<p>You steal a year of life from the young and healthy to give a year of life to the old and at risk. If THAT isnt selfish, I dont know what is.</p>

        <p>Mate, I live here. I‚Äôve been going about my normal life for the last year. We‚Äôve had one snap three day lockdown in my major city throughout the entire time. </p>

        <p>So you think that it only takes a couple of weeks of good solid lockdown and BOOM, everything is fine? Like America just locked down wrong?</p>
<p>Or maybe....the USA has ten times the international traffic of your island nation? Thereby making tracking an international viruses entry much harder? (https://www.citypopulation.de/en/world/bymap/airtrafficpassengers/)</p>
<p>Maybe government effectiveness and speed is better in a country with a population smaller than Texas, and only a bit bigger than the New York Metro Area. </p>
<p>Maybe the Australian medical system hasn't been given financial incentive to report every cough as a case and every death as covid.</p>

<p>You claimed that the youth of our country had a year of their lives taken from them without any idea of what has gone on here.</p>
<p>Yes, I think the US, and much of the rest of the world, could have contained this virus if they had have acted in early February when they knew what was happening.</p>
<p>The WHO released a tonne of material from mid Jan onwards suggesting countries implement strict travel control measures and no country listened.</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt get me wrong, we acted late as well, we were just better prepared and implemented more serious actions, targeting control through contact tracing. We got lucky and it worked.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I just assumed that if you had effective lockdowns, it must have been more than the years worth we have dealt with. My mistake. Not a goalpost shift. An assumption, and a wrong one. </p>
<p>And yeah, the kids here are not alright. You certainly did get lucky. We will see if that holds true into the future. But until we no longer have to worry about "outbreaks" neither country is out of the woods. But I bet we have more natural immunity now than New Zealanders and Australians have.   If the goal is heard immunity, I think we are winning that race.</p>

        <p>For your sake, I hope you are right. Or else the road ahead of your country is a long one. </p>
<p>Despite our differences in views on this, I can understand where you are coming from. Its easy to mock No-New-Normal members when you haven't been forced to live in lockdown for a year and a half. I dont think most people here would mind a couple weeks of full quarantine if we knew it would work, but we tried that (all non-essential business closed, no private gatherings, mask mandates, etc for 2 months), and while it worked for you, it didnt for us. And yet they continued it on and on, and it continued to fail. Then Texas and Florida open back up, and despite all the media screaming in terror...they are not much worse off.</p>
<p>You have to be able to imagine how that felt for us.</p>

        <p>Thats total REPORTED cases compared to total deaths WITH covid (largely). Assuming (as experts have) that a large percentage of infections are asymptomatic and unreported, and also in consideration of the fact that country reporting of fatalities DUE to covid are all over the board (due to a non-standardized process and definitions), we can assume that these numbers are wildly off or at best incredibly inaccurate.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the fatality rate varies WILDLY based on age and pre-existing conditions. Over the age of 85, the mortality rate is much higher than 2%. In locations with notorious vitamin D deficiencies, the mortality rate is higher. In the case of young healthy populations, the rate is much MUCH lower. </p>
<p>One unreliable data point does not an argument make.</p>

        <p>What about total deaths year on year. What‚Äôs caused all the extra deaths in 2020?</p>

        <p>Oh, I certainly think that covid has killed a LOT of people. And it is sad. But in my state, the total number of people younger than 20 that have died from covid is 3.</p>
<p>And it just so happens that the total number of people younger than 20 who died from Influenza in 2019....is also 3.</p>
<p>This disease is a danger to the elderly and the immune compromised. Those people should be hard quarantined and vaccinated. The rest of us? Our risk is incredibly low. As long as "the curve" remains low (you remember the curve? 2 weeks to flatten the curve?) The rest of us should be free to live our lives.</p>

        <p>The reason they haven't got a lot of deaths from a deadlier type of virus is because there is no new virus at all. It is the flu rebranded. 
If this was a new virus purposely released, they would have made it more deadly.</p>

        <p>THOSE are your big guns? If they claimed a high death rate (it is a LOT lower than 2% btw but I am not here to educate you on that) they would need to produce a lot of bodies. Are they getting their narrative through and goals achieved without the bodies? Yes.</p>

        <ol>
<li>
<p>China knew they had a dangerous virus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>China stopped internal travel to stop the spread of their dangerous virus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>China chose to allow infected Chinese to travel into western nations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Number 3 was a deliberate decision to weaponise the virus and constitutes the greatest biowarfare attack in human history.  Low death rate or not the harm from the Chinese virus has been immense.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs a crime but hardly a conspiracy because all those facts are public knowledge.</p>
