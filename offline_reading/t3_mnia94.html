    <strong>Is there hope for Canada to ever be free, or is it an authoritarian dystopia?</strong>
    <p><p>The news I see about Canada all tends to skew in the direction of describing draconian lockdown restrictions (comparable to the most extreme US states), and the quarantine hotels and church closures are eerily like what we see with Mainland Chinese policy.</p>
<p>Is Canada actually that bad off in terms of freedom, or is there hope for it?</p></p>

        <p>I'm here and it is as bad as you are hearing.  It is so frustrating to hear the US either being open, or at least moving towards open and us going in the other direction.  Our gyms have been closed for most of the last year with no signs of reopening.  No indoor dining for 300+ days in the last year.  No salons.  Businesses going out of business like crazy - even some that had been around for decades.  </p>
<p>We just yesterday started yet another 'stay at home' order across Ontario.  Constant media campaigns telling us to wear our masks, stay indoors.  Emergency alerts sent out over phones yesterday telling us the same.  </p>
<p>Medical officers of health have been given full power to do as they please and they see the only option as complete lockdown.  When unelected people are now running the show you are in a real bad position!</p>

        <p>Canada is a joke.</p>
<p>We've had a provincial curfew in Quebec set at 8pm for the past three and a half months.  Last month the curfew was graciously extended to 9:30pm.  This week, back to 8pm.</p>
<p>Very strict lockdowns.  Most stores are closed.  All restaurants and bars.  Most children are at home doing online learning. </p>
<p>And yet, numbers keep going up.</p>
<p>In Canada, strict lockdown, numbers keep going up.</p>
<p>In Florida, no lockdown, numbers keep going down.</p>
<p>Not sure why this is front page news.  Not sure why every Canadian isn't saying this to each other right now.</p>
<p>Most Canadians default to being nice in the face of conflicting information.  Unfortunately in this case, this is naive, like a lamb to the slaughter.</p>
<p>I have a few friends who are really pissed off about this.  And then I have a ton of friends who are still repeating the tired and broken talking points about "saving lives" and "killing grandma".</p>
<p>"Oh no!  But what about the variants!?!?"</p>
<p>"You should spend a day in the ICU.  Oh, those nurses making TikTok videos were just blowing off some steam."</p>
<p>The level of cognitive dissonance is staggering.</p>
<p>We're being led by a bunch of Marxist pussies here in Canada.</p>

        <p>It turns out the Quebecois are not as rebellious as they claim to be.</p>
<p>In any case, it feels like half the province works for the freaking government.  So of course they're getting their full salary.  What do they care if they destroy hundreds of thousands of lives?</p>

        <p>I'm in Nova Scotia... It's weird here. We've had indoor dining - at 50 percent capacity since June or so. Our gyms are open, same with retail. In June we were "allowed" to "bubble" with one other family... Shortly after that we were "allowed" to "bubble" with two other families.... </p>
<p>Ever since then we've had restrictions on home gatherings with either your household plus 10 or your household plus guests equalling no more than 10... Depending on the amount of cases.... We've also on and off opened up a "bubble" with our neighboring pronounced in Atlantic Canada... Equally low population density as us. Mask mandate since August... You get bullied and have the cops called if you go anywhere in public indoors without a mask.</p>
<p>I see people alone in thier cars with masks on a daily basis.</p>
<p>People think this is JUST GREAT!! If you mention being unhappy about it all.. they say how dare you.... Everyone acts like we are superheroes for doing better than the rest of Canada.</p>
<p>Our housing market is FUCKED because people are moving here from all over Canada in droves... But this isn't going to last a long time they say.</p>
<p>Everyone here is so fucking complacent it makes me sick. Yes we have low cases and more freedoms than the rest of Canada, but we are so cucked its not even funny.</p>

        <p>I’ve honestly considered it! I’ve never done something like that before so I don’t know how to go about it, but I think there is decent ground to claim refugee status on the ground of religious persecution among other things. I doubt Canadians would be high on the priority list though.</p>

        <p>Canada has been going down this road for quite some time. As with other countries, the negative trends and developments were out of sight, because nothing majorly went wrong: the economy was strong, there was no war, there was no direct and unfiltered crisis. Power could be exercised in the shadows. Hence pseudo-crisis like racism, climate change, sexism (and just for the record: I do not deny the existence of any of these or believe that there is no problem or that the current situation is in any way good. Just like the Corona hysteria: it is not a fundamental crisis that becomes worse and worse with every passing day) kept people busy and certain political tactics and ideas took root.</p>
<p>Now the chicken comes home to roost. Why are you surprised that a prime minister, who used the current year as a reason for his cabinet structure and bent over backwards to please the social media mob, shows his totalitarian leanings in his response to the crisis? Why are you surprised that Ontario, which created extrajudicial structures like their "human rights tribunal" and believes shaping its people behavior instead of representing it, becomes the worst offender when it comes to repression and violence against its people in its response to the virus? (same goes for NZ and AU. Both countries showed extraordinary harsh responses to disobedience and NZ introduced those "facilities" for quarantine rather quickly, didn't they?)</p>
<p>The writing was on the wall, but the damn screen in front of each of us binds our perception and energy. Way too many people are blinkered by social media, entertainment, unnecessary bullshit and the little mental space that is not occupied by a constant diet of celebrity nonsense, context-free and consequent-free information, false political promises and manufactured world views, is filled with fear, fear and more fear, because as human beings, we are powerless to take our eyes and minds off potentially dangerous things.</p>
<p>What can be observed in Canada has happened and happens all over the free, partly-free and non-free world. Protestors in the Netherlands, which used to be a liberal, peaceful, consensus-oriented country, were beaten by police as if they demanded the reintroduction of Nazism. The same in Belgium. France is now basically a big open-air prison. Germany's government extends its power more and more and consolidates it on a federal level. We know how that can end. Britbongland is completely lost, while everyday crime is still on the rise, police uses drones to catch people hiking in remote and rural parts of the country (only beat by NZ, where they used helicopters to find hikers and punish them for not complying with social distancing in the middle of fucking nowhere), and the public health institutions proved that downplaying and hiding adverse effects of the vaccines are acceptable "for the greater good". Sweden, which did not lock down, because it was illegal for the government to do so, slowly changes its laws. And for the US: you have yet to experience what a runaway security budget can do. The country is one dead black person away from tearing itself apart and this time, there is a buffoon in office who will not stop it.</p>
<p>Is there hope? Maybe. One reason the west dominated for so long was its ability to reinvent itself several times. Maybe it is time to push the traditional parties out of some parts of the system, beginning on a local level, and force the issue by dragging them before one court after another. Push for more transparency for public policy and do not treat past crimes as the past. The belief, that a government that committed a crime in the past, will not do it again, is part of the artificial feel-good world view that gets pushed into people's brains when they are young. Maybe time to change the myths around that as well.</p>
<p>Edit: oops, I didn't plan for it to become that long and angry. Sry.</p>
