        <p>Growing up poor, I've noticed little to no allergies in kids who grew up playing with sticks, rocks and dirt, while sheltered types, upper class, etc, were the ones who had common health issues, such as food allergies.</p>

        <p>Yeah, we used to call them "inside kids". The inside kids were always the ones with asthma, allergic to everything, etc. Us outside kids were never sick and allergies were unheard of.</p>

        <p>This is why many people don't like anecdotal evidence. The hygiene hypothesis (exposure to germs,=no allergies), is just a hypothesis. No one really knows exactly what causes these allergies. Until a real cause is found where it's consistently and predictably present and all cases, everybody will just guess and stab in the dark and there will be lots of hypotheses. That's how we as a society learn. That's science.</p>
<p>For example, I'm an old person, about 50 years old. I react to wheat and have had since the early 2,000s. I grew up middle class in the Midwest playing in the dirt with my brothers.</p>

        <p>We are also eating sterile food. That could be a contributor to the increase in allergy. Everything is cooked, pasturised, bleached, microwaved. Babies are fed similac instead of breast milk.</p>

        <p>Now, the formula is a good point. Early immune development happens from passing through the vagina (c-sections bypass this) and breast milk.</p>

        <p>And the sterile food. Maybe it's all a one-two punch. </p>
<p>And there are other factors that dysregulate gut bacteria, which throws things off at the surface where did is absorbed. I haven't read the rest of the thread. I'm sure others have mentioned that.</p>

        <p>I disagree, I grew up playing outside plenty and I still have very bad hayfever and a food allergy tied to this hayfever, for me and many others it is genetic and mine was passed to me by my mum. It is very well established that exposing yourself to things you are allergic to actually makes the allergy worse not better</p>

        <p>The only thing to "get", dude, is this is seriously how your average voting, working, child-bearing adults actually think. They are so stupid, being stupid would move them up a fucking peg. They thrive off contradiction as explanation and are constantly 2-3 steps removed from the actual causal process of how they're being manipulated 24/7.

        <p>Nope they look at you like wow that guys an literally risking his whole family and the people he randomly encounters on the off chance that this pandemic is a global set up. That's not only taking a huge gamble with your life, while the odds aren't really in your favor. Just because you don't like the way it feels. It's also just plain selfish and something you will regret a lot if you do lose that bet and you do infect your nan. Or someone who isn't as phisicaly fit as you are.</p>

        <p>That's quite a good argument you are making their. It almost convinced me. But I have a counter argument took me a while to come up with because the argument you made was so well thought-out. Allright so if we entertain the idea that it's a possibility that this global epidemic is real. Than what you are doing is gambling with people's life's and before you say well they were weak and we're going to die anyway. How are you going to explain to little suzan from around the corner that you killed her grandmother, because you were willing to risk life's because you believed in the change their wasn't a global pandemic. In my opinion if there is a chance that this pandemic is true, then I am not willing to risk other people's life's because I don't want to wear a mask (because it's uncomfortable).</p>

        <p>Good point and again love how open to discussions this subreddit is. I haven't had one demeaning comment yet. I've really misjudged you guys and galls. But to be fair the chances of her being hospitalized because of the common cold are a lot slimmer. But if in both cases they were hospitalized the old woman would've had a much higher chance of getting treatment back when the hospitals weren't filled to the brim with covid patients. So I think those are two quite good reasons why it's much more dangerous for Suzana grandmother right now if you don't put on a mask</p>

        <p>Probably unrelated but I've actually developed several new allergies over the past few months to eggs, lettuce and mushrooms. Well, I already sort of had them but they've become much worse. And despite being a hard-core sceptic I've pretty much followed the lockdowns to the letter (not msks though, they're fucking stupid), as I'm pretty introverted anyway.</p>

        <p>What if it isn’t unrelated? Chronic stress causes inflammation in your body. Allergies cause the same thing. Wouldn’t it make sense to have a more severe allergic reaction after the stress of the past 9 months of 24/7 Covid, isolation, and restrictions?</p>

        <p>You are not the only one of your generation that experienced this. Unfortunately, it is also your generation that perhaps, albeit unknowingly, promoted the allergic culture that exists today. Ask any baby boomer, especially an older sibling (who would be more likely to remember), what their household dietary restrictions were - the answer, across all household incomes, is typically that there were no restrictions: babies were given honey, peanut butter and nuts in general, and all other foods that are considered to be 'allergenic.'  </p>
<p>But when your generation started having kids of their own, they likely followed the national dietary guidelines that were busy being plastered all over the schools and doctors offices: babies shouldn't eat peanuts or honey until they are at least 3; feed them a diet based on healthy grains and sugar, etc. </p>
<p>Other than that, PTSD most definitely existed, it was just called a number of other terms (shell shock, combat fatigue...).</p>

        <p>I totally believe you, it was the generation that sent the kids to school and let them do the raising and eventual ruining, I am damn glad my wife and I were DINKS with zero interest in kids.. And yes PTSD was a thing forever but in people who went thru REAL trauma like warfare or true personal attack but these days kids get PTSD because they are called names online! It seems like they have gotten so paper skinned its pathetically laughable.</p>

        <p>I’m a parent of a child with a food allergy. To be fair, these tend to develop within the first two years of life, so I’m not sure you can blame this on lack of exposure to pathogens; the second part of this is more accurate for allergies to inhaled triggers such as pollen, dust, and pet dander. You might be able to argue that vaccines and antibiotic use in young infants may contribute to food allergies, but there’s a lot of stuff in our environment that could also be contributing to the development of food allergies.</p>

        <p>Hygiène hypothesis is the answer. I don't want to get too munch in details but there's a therapy that involves voluntarily infecting yourself with safe to human worms in order to modulate your immune sysytem. Too much sanitization, over vaccination and antibiotics are the reason behind the rise of autoimmune diseases.</p>

        <p>Didn’t help me, I was born with both in the early 80’s and haven’t grown out of them. Grew up solidly middle class. </p>
<p>I will say that there is either a marked increase or more awareness of their existence. Growing up, most normal food items like bread, crackers, or pasta for me was expensive and only through mail order or hope the health food store can get it. It also tasted like the box it came in. Now, I can have a gluten-free pizza delivered to my house from Dominos or Papa Johns and nearly every grocery store carries somewhat decent bread and pasta. </p>
<p>I also think there is a link between food (especially gluten) and autism. I have no scientific data to back this up other than stories from parents going back 15-20 years that some kids can’t digest wheat gluten and might be part of the reason there has been a boom in product availability and variety.</p>

        <p>Part of it, is that parents follow up on, and take their kids to the doctor more, for more minor issues now (versus when I was a kid). When I was growing up (and I was a farm kid) I had seasonal allergies of some sort (probably just hay fever). My parents gave me over the counter allergy pills occasionally, but it was otherwise pretty much ignored. I was fine. I seemed to outgrow it (haven’t had issues since my 20s) and/or have less exposure in city/suburban life. I think my experience was fairly typical...parents didn’t react to minor sniffles and sneezing etc so much (severe reactions- of course-different story). Sometimes they would just decide a food “doesn’t agree with me”- if they are unwell after eating it, and then avoid the food- Rather then get allergy tests. Same with behavioral issues- when I was growing up there were always multiple kids (usually boys) who were kind of disruptive in class, hyper, etc. They were never diagnosed with “issues” and most grew up fine as far as I know. Same with general quirkiness. No one ever thought it was a disorder to be medically/psychologically treated. These days, every parent thinks their kid has sensory issues, ADD, whatever. I think in some ways increased diagnosis is GOOD (don’t get me wrong) so that kids can get help early. In other cases though (milder ones) I am a bit skeptical, TBH, and think we probably intervene a bit too much.</p>

<p>Hey, got my first car ever, a 2020 AWD SXT. Best decision of my life. I had only driven in economy class rentals before, and my parent's average Mazda. I was so shocked at the handling of the SXT, and how fast it goes from 0-60. Like BLOWN away going from a Camry lol. </p>
<p>I feel stupid bc I can't even imagine how the better models ride, esp the Hellcat or the demon. Has anyone driven the SXT and compared it to their experiences in better models? Is it a world's difference? Should I make a friend with one and test ride it? Thanks!</p>

        <p>Yes thank you, I worked really hard to get that. Sorry I make way more money than you and unlike other people with money I don't spend my time yelling at poor people to stay inside. I personally know someone who was abused. I have had to take her to the police station. It is also very fucking personal as a woman. You clearly have no concept of real world problems as a shut in. And domestic abuse is skyrocketing bc locking down comfortably is a privilege and that is a fact that all these mainstream sources report. Again, not my opinion, literally being reported. Saying "you didnt care before" is false and is a fucking sick way to justify current suffering.</p>

        <p>You should volunteer with an abuse prevention organization. If you spent as much time on that as you do here you might make a real difference for someone. 
Although, you might be one of the abusers considering how often you verbally abuse people in your comments.</p>

        <p>You have no fucking idea how much charity and activism I do. You have no idea how much I contribute. Reddit helps me feel heard and better informs me to speak up against quarantine and it's helped me make my friends change their mind and stop promoting a multi billion dollar Iraq War style fear campaign that is plunging millions of people into suffering while spend your time minimizing abuse victims' pain and promoting lazy heroism and yelling a poor people for wanting to see their families. I am dedicated to this cause with my life and I will fight for the suffering. </p>
<p>You will be remembered the same as the people who promoted slavery, Nazism, the Vietnam War, the Korean War, the Drug War, the anti gay movement, and the Iraq War all of which were popular to promote at the time as all your opinions come from billionaires and social media. Every comment I went ham on was literally in the last night and I barely commented last week, and it was in response to sick comments like accusing me of being fat or some stupid shit, or minimizing suicide and abuse and I have every right to get mad for the people I know suffering. You are an abusive sick loser. Get a life and get a real job or hobby that actually helps people and leave vulnerable people alone. I have a real job I need to focus on now and I will stop responding to privileged classist ableist sexist apathetic monsters like you. Good day.</p>

        <p>Yeah, you're right. That wasn't fair and I apologise. That was a very hurtful thing to say and I regret saying it. I assumed something about you that I shouldn't have.
That being said you put some pretty heavy labels on me. You surmised from the very few things I said that I'm pro slavery, anti gay, a loser, I'd be remembered as a Nazi, I mean seriously, you said a lot of hateful things while making yourself out to be some kind of revolutionary.</p>

        <p>Don't say someone is aggressive when you start an aggressive conversation. I didn't say you are those things, I said every time those things happened, the majority of people supported the wrong side and called you crazy for disagreeing. And you are on the wrong side like they are.</p>
<p>I am very hateful. I am a relatively lucky person and seeing the innocent people in my life suffer from these human rights tragedies gets me fucking hateful. I was bullied for being gay before it was cool, not like I expect you to care. But everyone thought I was crazy and followed the majority of opinion. Ten years later it became cool to support gays. I know how public opinion changes with the seasons and I get fucking mad. All the pain I went through bc it wasn't trendy to care. Then people suffering now from the same style propaganda that hurts the most vulnerable, are also ignored. Yeah I am fucking mad. I don't want to respond to this anymore.</p>
