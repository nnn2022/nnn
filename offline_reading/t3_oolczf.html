    <strong>I'm vaccinated. I didn't really want to be. But here am.</strong>
    <p><p>Just posting here to say I'm vaccinated and
didn't want to beâ€¦ I was pretty much forced
to by my University. I decided it wasn't a hill I
was willing to die on, and just got it anyways.
My main issue is I'm at absolutely no risk of
suffering COVID, and I've most likely had it
anyways considering I worked in a restaurant
throughout quarantine. It's also bullshit that
universities require a non-FDA approved
vaccine that is new and relatively (compared
to other vaccines) untested. I live in a pretty
liberal state and everybody ain't dead yet so
at least there's that. That being said, fuck
your vaccine passports, fuck universities
requiring this shit, and fuck the new normal.
Don't worry, I'Il still post dumbasses being
dumbasses because it fun to argue with the
other mongrels on this site.</p></p>
