    <strong>help us, Robert Pattinson!</strong>
    <p><p>lol okay so, Robert Pattinson is filming “Batman” and has tested positive for the ‘Rona: <a href="https://archive.vn/m6YCU">https://archive.vn/m6YCU</a></p>
<p>he might not be the hero we want, but he's the hero we need.</p>
<p>now, i’m not usually delighted when people get sick, but Robert Pattinson is a special kind of sexy asshole (like, the kind of sexy asshole who goes on my top five people i would bang if the opportunity ever came up because my husband and i have an agreement that we get five celebrity fucks, which will never ever happen) who loves talking shit about the movies in which he stars and has an incredibly dark, twisted, self-deprecating sense of humor that really gets my rocks off.</p>
<p>he’s the guy who’s always making fun of himself and talking shit about Twilight (he was the super-sexy vampire, Edward Cullen. please don’t make me talk about Twilight, lol, i’ve avoided it for like, ten years): <a href="https://archive.vn/pWeAD">https://archive.vn/pWeAD</a></p>
<p>SO i’m really hoping that Pattinson comes out of (legitimate) quarantine and in his delightfully dry British way tells everyone to bugger off because it’s a fucking joke and he’s perfectly fine and everyone’s overreacted and it’s time to end the madness. just really roll the Doomers here and mock them. i absolutely expect him to make fun of himself and tell everyone to fuck off.</p>
<p>you see, Pattinson is not a tool - unlike Tom Hanks or Alyssa Milano or Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson - Pattinson has no fucks left to give, and still doesn’t give a fuck. he’s literally beholden to no one. no one expects Batman to be very good. no one expected him to be that good in Tenet (fan-fucking-tastic film, btdubs, do recommend getting the full experience in a movie theater). Pattinson can say and do what he wants because he isn’t wholly owned by a corporation. even when he was in a popular franchise with rabid fans, he didn’t care. </p>
<p>he’s amazing. he’s not going to make some teary, staged YouTube confessional a la the Rock, making everyone feel bad for leaving their homes. he’s not going to concoct some tragic “post-covid-19 long hauler” sob story like Alyssa Milano, he’s not going to guilt trip everyone like Tom Hanks. the Doomers will lose their minds. </p>
<p>he’s our last hope for a straight shooter. (everyone sort of blew off Novak Djokovic, and my new conspiracy theory is that he defaulted from the U.S. Open this summer because he didn’t take the ‘Rona seriously enough for everyone. he’s not the bad guy! it was an honest mistake! everyone is ragging on him because he didn’t freak out after he got cover-19! HE ORGANIZED A TENNIS TOURNAMENT HE’S A WARLOCK BURN HIM AT THE STAKE. ugh, gag me with a spoon, spare me. more info here: <a href="https://archive.vn/dRvki">https://archive.vn/dRvki</a>)</p>
<p>Pattinson is going to come out of self isolation, get the fuck back to work, and keep nailing hot models in his free time. he’s a true patriot, taxpayer, gentleman, and scholar. i wish him the best of luck. godspeed.</p></p>

        <p>Please be right about this. We need someone high profile, who appeals to the right audience, to toss the pebble in the water and start the ripple effect.</p>
<p>Your post was a fun read.</p>

        <p>Honestly the sob story the Rock did was fucking hilarious, how hard he tried to say 'we all tested positive' like its some cancer diagnosis or something. I haven't heard of Pattison before this but the movie has me interested and i cant wait to see this play out.</p>
