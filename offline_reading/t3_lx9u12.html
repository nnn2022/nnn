    <strong>Some Covid "long-haulers" feeling better after first vaccine shot</strong>
    <p><p>So, at the following article:  <a href="https://www.wpxi.com/news/top-stories/long-term-covid-19-side-effects-could-go-away-after-first-vaccine-doctors-say/RYHEOCFIQNAOBDD6GFRGICKUZI/">Long-term COVID-19 side effects could go away after first vaccine, doctors say (wpxi.com)</a> , they're saying fatigue/brain fog is being relieved. From what I've found, long covid has symptoms similar to ME/CFS, PVFS, and anxiety. This isn't meant to be a pro or anti vaccine post, but it's making me think maybe for some long haulers, their symptoms were really related to anxiety but for them, the vaccine made them feel "relieved". Just something I've been thinking.</p></p>

        <p>Give them a saline shot and tell them it's the vaccine and they'd be magically cured also.  It's psychosomatic. Mental illness.</p>

        <p>I mean it‚Äôs common knowledge that anxiety, stress, and worry do a great number of damage to the immune system and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if all the fear-mongering successfully contributed to that.  </p>
<p>Also, the placebo effect is a very real phenomenon and the vaccine, like you said, gives comfort in a visual and physical way.  It seemed sketch to me that a vaccine, which would affect the virus, also causes these long-term effects to heal despite them being claimed to be occurring post-infection.  The mind is a powerful thing and I think you were spot on with what you said.</p>

        <p>Interestingly, so does Ivermectin.</p>
<p>Now which one would I choose ü§î</p>
<p>Focus on not getting COVID by vitamin D and good nutrition. Early treatment with Ivermectin if you develop illness.</p>

        <p>There's some B.S. if I've ever seen it.   The purpose of the v is to INTERFERE WITH THE FUNCTION OF FURINS - specifically those used by the virus.  HOWEVER - FURINS ARE UTILIZED BY EVERY HUMAN BODILY SYSTEM.  And as scientists mentioned during the development of the V the trouble is that most of these injections which interfere with FURIN ACTIVITY... Are non specific... ie they interfere with EVERY SYSTEM OF THE BODY ON A CELLULAR LEVEL.  Anyways... </p>
<p>I am compiling reports of injury following the V to spread awareness. Continually updated and reposted as frequently as it's deleted.</p>
<p>As you read just picture a parent flying a kite with his child, an old couple hiking, or a man in a wheelchair playing fetch with his dog. "Side Effects May Include"..... <a href="https://prezi.com/i/rgn8osphb_re">prezi.com/i/rgn8osphb_re</a></p>
