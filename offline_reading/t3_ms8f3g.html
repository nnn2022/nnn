    <strong>University's Random Mandatory Testing</strong>
    <p><p>I am attending a college in the US, and they have a system of randomly selecting students for mandatory covid testing. I applied for religious exemption, on the basis that my beliefs in self-determination and bodily autonomy are analogous to more traditional religious beliefs. I didn't get denied right away and got a meeting with someone from the dean of students. I really liked the person I met with and they were understanding, but said ultimately the decision isn't up to them and they just pass our conversation up to someone else.</p>
<p>Well, now my request has been denied and I still need to schedule a test or I "may face further disciplinary action". I really don't know what to do about this, it seems outrageous that I should have to get tested when I don't want to simply because the university said so, but is it worth getting expelled over, probably not.</p></p>

        <p>Yes, it is worth gettimg expelled over, you must fight this. You are young but you are on the front lines, and this is a war. You must be brave enough to show these people they cant get away with this. It is both a matter of personal bodily autonomy and the good of society. They are using these test results to keep everyone locked down.  It is never wrong to do the right thing.</p>

        <p>The thing is that I’m sure I technically agreed to this somewhere when I decided to attend this year, in some contract or something. I feel like I should have been more attentive then and not attended this year because of this practice. But now it seems pretty late to make a big thing of it, especially since there’s less than a month left. Idk man</p>

        <p>Tell them a lawyer will be able to find the reason. You have to push back against these guys and make them sweat, they arent gods and there is literally no scientific reason for them to be doing this. Even if you feel you cant go thru with it all the way, keep pushing and pushing</p>

        <p>Yeah I guess the thing to do is push it to the limits. Even if by the end I end up getting the test I can at least make it difficult for them to get me to, and also talk to as many people as I can who are involved about it.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't tell them how you feel. You did that already. Just ask them for a reasoned explanation for the denial and tell them that once you get their explanation, you will decide what you will do. At least, that's what I'd do. Telling them how you feel will just give them more that they can try to refute. If it appears that you have 5 reasons for your position, and they can attack 3 of them, they will think they win. A smaller number of your best reasons is better.</p>

        <p>It’s random because it’s “prevalence testing”. I guess going with the whole asymptomatic narrative, or maybe assuming that people with symptoms won’t necessarily voluntarily get tested</p>

        <p>Yes but what they are doing is not prevalence testing, it wont work as that, and it certainly cant be argued that it is being done to protect the health of the students either</p>

        <p>Can you elaborate on that? I feel like it could be argued that it protects the health of the students because, if they do it enough they will catch some people who haven’t developed symptoms yet and maybe go on to infect some people. I certainly don’t think that very small benefit outweighs the idea of requiring random people without symptoms to get tested, but they could still claim it protects our health that way.</p>

        <p>I'll try to find some concise sources for you, but there are a lot of reasons. Previously they used more than PCR tests to diagnose disease (like symptoms or close contact with someone who had it) because otherwise a positive doesnt mean mean you have the disease. (look up Kary Mullis incentor of the PCR test).  Also randomly testing a few people and forcing positives isnt going to stop an outbreak after a disease is endemic.</p>

        <p>OP, this is where you have to decide, to stand on principle or cave in to these c0ck suckers.  Me? I wouldn't take it. Find another university or college that respects your rights, vote with your dollars. Remember, you chose them, they didn't choose you. So you are not bound to them in any way. They are just being bullies and are attempting to use you to pad their numbers. </p>
<p>This is the tough part, but in the end, you have to weigh what is in your best interest both in the long and short term. If you stand on principle, you can look back in 20 years and be glad you weren't pushed around. Your children and spouse will appreciate and admire that their parent isn't a coward. Good luck to you!</p>

        <p>Yes this. The key is remembering that they dont want to test you for the virus, they want to test your submission or not. Just scheduling and rescheduling will be submission enough for them I bet.</p>
