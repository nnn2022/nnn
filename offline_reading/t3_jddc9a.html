    <strong>What are some questions to ask truly brainwashed people to make them think?</strong>
    <p><p>My mum is doing the whole mask thing as a virtue signal on social media, but my dad is truly brainwashed. He spends most of the day consuming propaganda, when he's in the office he is viewing Tweets from pro-restrictions celebrity worshippers and in any other room will be watching news channels or listening to the radio which has these shitty government adverts every brake about wearing masks for the "Greater Good".</p>
<p>Yesterday, I asked him how many daily deaths we needed to go back to normal. That made him stop and think, are there any other questions that can do this?</p></p>

        <p>That should be an argument for why mandatory masks wouldn't work and why they should be voluntarily instead. Less errors means less spreading.</p>

        <p>Are you happy that millions of young people have had their lives ruined, without being able to do anything? Often even being blamed for being "uncaring" or "irresponsible", as those who will kill "gran"? As if they are the only ones who don't wear masks and don't do social distancing?</p>
<p>How have we coped all these years with the flu? The common cold? Have people not died from other coronaviruses in the past? Are the deaths of older people who caught the flu from a relative less important than Covid? Why was there no such disgust and disbelief back then?</p>
<p>What about the suicides, the cancer deaths, the millions who will die of poverty and starvation in poor countries that have been blocked off because of economic shutdowns and no commerce for fear of Covid spreading?</p>

        <p>Because millions of people are losing their livelihoods, poverty kills too. Our tunnel vision with covid has led to increase in these poverty related deaths (starvation, suicide, overdose, etc) and that’s not to mention how other people aren’t able to access medical care, that also leads to a soar in deaths because of that (see how cancer referrals are scary low right now, a disease that needs to be caught early.) on top of all the added deaths caused by government intervention, we’ve also greatly reduced our quality of life to try to fight this virus.</p>

        <p>Ok, but how is the cure worse than the disease? Social distancing isnt a cure. Masks aren't a cure. They are measures being taken to help slow the spread of this virus while we try to develop a cure.</p>

        <p>Why was it never recommended to wear masks during flu season at any other point in modern history?</p>
<p>Do they have any guilt over the fact that they could have been one link in a chain of transmission of the flu, which may have killed someone?</p>
<p>How is it that the flu returns each year during flu season? Why, even with a vaccine, has the flu not been eliminated?</p>
<p>Can they explain how masks actually work, specifically how they protect others but not the wearer? If this is the case, how does one actually prevent getting the virus?</p>
<p>Can they detail how to structure a lockdown in a perfect world, and expand on how to actually keep everyone at home for 6 weeks? Can they explain how first responders, healthcare workers, and other essential industries would be sustained? Can they explain how people would access food and other essential services?</p>

        <p>You can ask them "after living a life of freedom and prosperity made possible by the brave actions of our grandfathers and long lost brothers who died defeating the Nazis" does it seem in anyway selfish to destroy the economy, small businesses, peoples life's work, and my children's childhood because all of a sudden you have been presented with a &lt;1% risk of getting sick at the grocery store.</p>

        <p>Interesting question.
I ask people when they first heard about the virus because often it was when Wuhan were locking down, the "falling man" video circulated, Chinese doctors were "collapsed" in the corridors and they were disinfecting the streets. I then try and make them consider whether they saw anything of that scale here? Usually the answer is no. I then sort of press them, asking why did China have to spread such misinformation? If the virus was so lethal, surely the truth would have been enough? I guess my take on this is that people have forgotten the origins of their fear. You have to be careful with this though, as mentioning China means people can disregard you as a conspiracy theorist quite quickly.</p>

        <p>I hate to disagree but the mind-thrill mentality is more likely nurture vrs a genetic component. Our society is designed to make people obedient, not free-thinkers. Pretty much most of early life choices are about getting individuals to conform their beliefs to a set dogma. Be that religion, education, media, consumer choices etc. </p>
<p>IQ, which is a genetic factor, for sure, but I firmly believe nurture is how we turned humans into automotons</p>

        <p>Talked with my mom about the ridiculousness of all the measures and she would sheepishly try to defend them. I then proposed to show her CDC papers and documents that state they have not isolated the virus, never even seen the damn thing and yet they some how know who is infected by it. She flat out refused and told me nothing I say would change her mind.</p>
<p>She told me to drop it. I did but not before telling her I was giving her one more chance to get right with the situation because whatever they do from this point on, she is contributing to it. I got the standard eye roll but it doesn't make what I was saying any less true. We just have to wait and watch it finally dawn on them. It will because TPTB are not going to stop. They will never be satisfied even with full compliance. That's what doomers don't understand....</p>

        <p>You can actually culture the virus in cells, and see it under a microscope, if you want. The PCR tests amplify its genome, which is also a psysical particle. </p>
<p>There's no doubt that it is real, the only problem we're having is how the epidemics is handled. Denying facts won't get you anywhere.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry this is completely incorrect. You cannot culture the virus in the cells. You can culture bacteria but viruses are not bacteria.</p>
<p>Viruses are actually nuclei ejected out of cells trying to cleanse itself. When you see those pictures of viruses the objects that look like spikes are the debris which is being ejected.</p>
<p>As far as the corona virus it has not been isolated. It clearly states that in this document titled:</p>
<p><strong>CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel</strong> page 39 they have not isolated the virus :</p>
<p>"<em>The analytical sensitivity of the rRT-PCR assays contained in the CDC 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019- nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel were determined in Limit of Detection studies.</em> <strong><em>Since no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently available</em></strong>*, <em>assays designed for detection of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length RNA (N gene; GenBank accession: MN908947.2) of known titer (RNA copies/μL) spiked into a diluent consisting of a suspension of human A549 cells and viral transport medium (VTM) to mimic clinical specimen. Samples were extracted using the QIAGEN EZ1 Advanced XL instrument and EZ1 DSP Virus Kit (Cat# 62724) and manually with the QIAGEN DSP Viral RNA Mini Kit (Cat# 61904). Real-Time RT-PCR assays were performed using the ThemoFisher Scientific TaqPathTM 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix, CG (Cat# A15299) on the Applied BiosystemsTM 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument according to the CDC 2019-nCoV Real- Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel instructions for use</em>*. "</p>
<p>This is further corroborated by Dr Tom Cowan in his <a href="https://blog.nomorefakenews.com/2020/10/19/dr-tom-cowan-explores-the-covid-virus-invented-out-of-sheer-nonsense/">article</a> titled:</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tom Cowan explores the COVID virus invented out of sheer nonsense</strong></p>
<p><em>“First, in the section titled ‘Whole Genome Sequencing,’ we find that rather than having isolated the virus and sequencing the genome from end to end, they found 37 base pairs from unpurified samples using PCR probes. This means they actually looked at 37 out of the approximately 30,000 of the base pairs that are claimed to be the genome of the intact virus. They then took these 37 segments and put them into a computer program, which filled in the rest of the base pairs.”</em></p>
<p><em>In other words, the sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was done by assumption and arbitrary inference. If this is science, a penguin is a spaceship.</em></p>
<p>The PCR test is NOT designed to diagnose viral infections of any sort. It's inventor Kary Mullis states that in many interviews available on various video platforms. The PCR doesn't amplify it's genome it amplifies the debris, but not just viral debris but all types of genetic debris. There are numerous epidemiologist that have criticized the PCR threshold they currently use which is set at 45 I believe which is far too high according to them. The test is wildly inaccurate  (see NFL and College coaches for false negatives) yet it is still being used for this purpose.</p>
