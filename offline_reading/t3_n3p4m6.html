    <strong>I wonder what the history books are going to say about this pandemic</strong>
    <p><p>We look back at the cold war duck and cover drills they did at school, and find it ridiculous. As  if the children would be protected by their wooden desks. When I was in high school we had a school shooter drill, where they funneled all of us into a room in the center of the building surrounded by windows with only 1 way out (like fish in a barrel). But this time, I'm wondering if this whole event will be portrayed seen for the scam that it is 50 years from now.</p>
<p>It should be obvious, given the counterintuitive and absurd methods that we use to avoid the damn thing. We can take off our masks at restaurants and the virus will ignore us because we're eating? Airplanes are packed, yet the government convinced us that the filled up planes are safer than sitting in a park? Swimming with a mask on, double masking, making kids wear masks when running. Oh and not to mention the police who arrest people at churches and parks, who are clearly not social distancing when clumped up shoulder to shoulder to stomp on people.</p>
<p>Public figures faking their vaccines on live tv, with no attempt to cover up the obvious lie? Anthony Hopkins who had the nurse empty the contents of the vaccine into a bin. The health minister of Belgium getting a shot with no needle. The media using old footage of the aftermath of a gas leak in India and pretended it was the result of Covid. And not to mention the people on r/covidvaccinated despite every single  post being about some negative reaction, are still somehow convincing themselves that the shot is nothing but a good thing. The fact that doctors say you are in danger from the unvaccinated despite being immune? That should be a major fucking red flag.</p>
<p>Honestly I'm really just venting, but I'm kind of pessimistic about how history will  perceive this event. All of the deception seems so easy to spot, and yet people keep falling for the same shit over and over again. Honestly, I'm not a smart guy, I've always assumed I'm the idiotic one among my friends and family. But everyone around me who has no right to be this stupid is somehow convinced by the main stream medias extremely clumsy and pathetic attempts at deceiving us.</p>
<p>I don't know, rant over, thanks for listening for anybody that even cares to read lol.</p></p>

        <p>There is and has been so much hypocrisy.  And there have been so many things that "the experts" have gotten wrong.  I think it was okay to tolerate some of that in the first few months; we seemingly <em>didn't</em> know what this thing was.  But after 14 months or so we are being told that it's fine to not wear a mask if you're eating, but you <strong>must</strong> wear one if you're not, in exactly the same place...... well, that stretches credulity too far.  And that's only one of many many examples.  Yet people continue to say, 'well, we know more now than we did then'.  And my favorite:  'why do we even have leadership if we're not going to follow it?'</p>
<p>Good post.</p>

        <p>I remember one of my high school teachers saying if there is a school shooting you better RUN out of the building. The people who stay inside do not survive. She even told us not to tell anyone but I’m glad some teachers still have common fucking sense. It does make me wonder what’s to come out of this.</p>

        <p>Well, when every one has kids post vaccination and then there is major issues with conceving or still births for their children because of the population control agenda..  they will just play it off like "oh just a mistake by our forefathers, gosh they were so ignorant.".. Sorry you can't have grandkids.. We didn't know 🤷 guess we don't need to teach history anymore</p>
