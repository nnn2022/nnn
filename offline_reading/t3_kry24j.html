    <strong>I had to stop my mother and brother from calling the police on some kids</strong>
    <p><p>Holy shit. I went on a walk with my brother and mother around the town. We passed a park with maybe 5 or so kids which were no older than ten and they actually discussed phoning the police. These were just random kids minding their own business playing on swings and they actually wanted some cops to take them away.</p>
<p>Obviously I told them not to because they’re just in a park buy they wouldn’t stop saying that it was illegal and they could infect older people and similar bullshit. I was absolutely dumbfounded as these kids some of which were actual toddlers might be arrested for hanging out with friends. Eventually after heated debate they gave up on the idea but they kept trying to justify it as if it had to be done, like everything that was illegal MUST be prosecuted NO MATTER WHAT. I can’t believe how brainwashed they are</p></p>

        <p>I feel like people are getting worse. Much worse.</p>
<p>I went out to a diner earlier. One that was closed until recently when my town re-opened indoor dining. The place was comfy, and I liked going there because the staff appeared to be anti-lockdown/masks/new normal. One of the few places I've gone to that has been even a bit lax on restrictions. But today, I overheard the owner and one of the waitresses talking to some guy, and they basically berated people for "not following the rules", and peppered in a "I sure hope the vaccines come out faster so we can end it soon". These people would wear masks practically under their chins, had signs about "FREE (my state)" on their door, and seemed to not care if people walked around inside without masks. </p>
<p>I felt absolutely crushed when this happened. I'm not sure if people are just being complete and utter hypocrites or if the fear mongering is getting so intense that more people are buying it, even skeptics. I have no idea what to think or feel anymore. Things are just fucking insane, and I am not seeing improvement...</p>

        <p>I've been surprised by this a few times. People who seem like they are skeptical of lockdowns are actually pro-lockdown when you talk to them. You have to be careful what you say. I ended up getting into arguments with a few of these people, because I assumed they felt the same way I did. </p>
<p>Like, one guy I knew this summer didn't wear a mask at work and would go out to eat. He berated me later on for going to a bar and told me I should be wearing a mask when I shop. He was a complete hypocrite. It was the weirdest thing.</p>

        <p>This only works if you’re exposed to it 24/7. Feet them to turn the TV, get them to take off the mask, get them to remember what it’s like being human again. Easier said than done I know. Best to you!</p>

        <p>I have to act like COVID is a big deal sometimes if a customer or coworker brings it up, because it’s just easier for me to not discuss it at that particular time.</p>
<p>That could possibly be what you overheard but obviously you’d know better than I. Either way, it’s important to support these small businesses with actual money and not the fake online platitudes you’ll find in some other subs.</p>

        <p>I know it's easier, but there are consequences to pretending everyone is fine with this bullshit, and we're witnessing them. This will all keep getting worse asomg as everyone plays along. I don't know your situation, if there are other factors, whatever, and I won't diminish the significance of those either, but as much as people can, they need to share their anger at what is going on.</p>

        <p>I agree. It’s more a matter of not having time to break down WHY I’m angry that I have to meet my customers out front of my store(that’s literally the rule, it’s so dumb), but I’d say 90% of our regulars would fit right into this sub.

        <p>I take walks sometimes on my lunch.  I go through a park along the water and used to see a lot of unmasked people.  I went out today and pretty much everyone’s as wearing a mask.  I don’t wear one outside and got a few dirty looks, but nothing like what you’re talking about.</p>

        <p>This may sound fucked up but I don't even know if I get dirty looks when I don't wear a mask because I legit don't even notice and acknowledge people with masks on as human. To my brain it would be like noticing if a deer is staring at me in some way. I just don't even notice even if I'm looking right at them.</p>

        <p>Damn that’s horrible... I’m definitely thankful my entire family is wide awake to all the bs that’s been going on since day one. I’ve prepared them for this for years and always told them one day a switch will be flipped and one day life as you know it will be over. Covid was that switch and they’ve thanked me countless times since all this happened for waking them up.</p>

        <p>You're lucky. I been talking about this stuff for 15 years and now its happening and my stupid family is still stupid.</p>
<p>My sister was even waking up. Sent me a couple podcasts etc. The next week i see on her fb about being excited for the fucking vaccine.</p>
<p>I think it's the 'winning team' mentality. They wanna be on the team. So they just go with what the tv says. Pathetic.</p>

        <p>What I think is bad. With where I live, no one seems to care about the people around them anymore. Everyone seems drastically selfish in terms of self preservation at the very least. Everyone just seems panicked and constantly stressed, ready to do anything for themselves. Its extremely tense to go anywhere in public anymore.</p>
