    <strong>Development Timeline of the EU Vaccine Passport aka the GREEN PASS - links to EU commission reports.</strong>
    <p><p>Sep 2017 </p>
<p>Jean-Claude Junckers State of the Union speech.</p>
<p><strong>East to West: Europe must breathe with both lungs. Otherwise our continent will struggle for air.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>In a Union of equals, there can be no second class citizens.</strong> It is unacceptable that in 2017 there are still children dying of diseases that should long have been eradicated in Europe. Children in Romania or Italy must have the same access to measles vaccines as children in other European countries. No ifs, no buts. This is why we are working with all Member States to support national vaccination efforts. Avoidable deaths must not occur in Europe.</p>
