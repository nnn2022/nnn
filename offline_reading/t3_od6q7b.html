    <strong>Have you noticed any differences in behavior of the vaxxed?</strong>
    <p><p>My family members seem to me like they are on low dose of valium since vaccination. </p>
<p>Also few days after they took the shot i developed weird throat irritation and occasional chest pains that doesnt go away even after three weeks. Never had anything like this. Could this be COVID or spike-proteins?</p></p>

        <p>I've noticed a dullness about people in general, like walking down the street there's less of a "soul" on people, the same way it's missing on hardcore drug people. Many just seem invisible. Can't say if it's the vaxx or the brainwashing</p>

        <p>I like the notion about souls after a near-death experience. You see those without when they resort to becoming demons when you'd done nothing wrong. It's given a rather unsettling image into the idea of being the undead vs the dead. Right now it feels like I'm walking in an ocean of 50/50. Because my life got rather fucking strange after that near-death...</p>
<p>It's when they have faith in the system and focus only on things and not people. It was just designed that way. To stop people from knowing a truth so they go off blindly and create this machine like life so many are accustomed to.</p>

        <p>Vaxxed people can't stop talking about it. They ask the same question over and over. "Did you get your shot ?". And they make fun of you when you say "no", meaning you are a threat for the society.</p>

        <p>Ever seen The Kingsman? Where, through cellular devices, someone was able to manipulate the rage within people. Culling the planet through rage alone. Simplistic compared to the reality that people really haven't a clue how evil people can be until they're pushed or stressed.</p>
<p>That's why American society to me seems like a ticking time bomb. One little lie told on the media would tare it all to shreds. Because people have grown too comfortable and haven't any idea about their instincts that've been manipulated overtime. So many things that are seemingly harmless actually change the way you think and behave overtime.</p>

        <p>My dad has worked hard his whole life and is still swinging an axe at 70.</p>
<p>Two things immediately happened when he got vaccinated.</p>
<p>1) He's been tired constantly since he was vaccinated back in March.</p>
<p>My dad and I spend a lot of time together every day, so I saw the energy loss happen first hand. </p>
<p>2) I lost a significant amount of hearing in one ear.  I've seen several doctors and even had an MRI.  No clue what caused it.</p>
<p>The (albeit remote) possibility of his spike protein shedding somehow causing my hearing loss didn't occur to me until recently.  I'm curious to see if anyone else thinks this is as rediculous as I want to believe it is. </p>
<p>I guess what gave me this idea was a post I saw recently about a girl who went blind after getting vaccinated.</p>

        <p>I hear that. I'm hoping that similar things I am experiencing have mental explanations. The mind really is as powerful, as it is sensitive.  </p>

        <p>I went to a shop yesterday, it is a small gourmet/butcher store. I think it may have been a bad idea spike protein wise, most were unmasked. I was there to buy some meat for dinner. Some people were out on the street, and around 8 in the store, I didn't get close to anyone though a lady held a door open for me. I am wearing masks due to having COPD and severe disabilities--yes I know, but now it's for spike proteins too, and maybe it won't protect me, I am rethinking everything. </p>
<p>The people seem odd to me, like they don't laugh or smile as much,  even all the unmasked just seemed muted. I feel like there is less of a soul on people too like greener skies. Sometimes I see someone with light in their eyes and wonder if they are unvaxxed. This one woman had light in her eyes at the store and I could tell they were making her wear a mask though she was wearing it down.</p>
<p>I had a startle, wonder if God was trying to warn me, saw a sign in a window of some brand of something that said SPIKE. LOL, in large letters. I try to listen to stuff like that. Had a dream this morning of a spider biting me on the finger, and that feels like a double warning.</p>
<p>I just did business, bought the meat and got out.  I walked down the middle of the road to avoid people--we were parked a ways down. </p>
<p>I am not visiting or seeing anyone in person because I am afraid of the spike proteins, and think maybe this store was even too busy, but I have to live and get things I need and husband was worn out.</p>

        <p>I have seen it in a few [I have no contact with people in person but there is one woman I know from a group I am in, who from Facebook she seems to be in full blown mania. I used to be in a group for depression that had some bipolar people in it and she seems to be fitting the bill. [Im not bipolar in my case] According to her Facebook, she went on a 10 state vacation, helicopter ride, hikes, parties, fancy dinners and is now at home having a dinner and barbecue today. She is younger. Some of the oldsters literally have disappeared.</p>

        <p>You‚Äôre most likely being effected by the spike protein shedding you were exposed to. I would look into taking ivermectin if I were you, I‚Äôve heard it can help with shedding issues</p>

        <p>Ivermectin is harder to get from doctors, but the animal version of the medication is the same and much easier to get a hold of. I am not a doctor and won‚Äôt give medical advice ( though I‚Äôve seen plenty of doctors who would), I am just speaking from personal experience.</p>
