    <strong>Chickens</strong>
    <p><p>Legend has it that Joseph Stalin gathered his henchmen and asked for a live chicken, in order to make a point to his commissars. While clutching the chicken, he proceeded to pluck out all of its feathers. At this point, he told his henchmen to watch what happens next. Stalin took out some breadcrumbs, placed the chicken on the floor, and walked away with some breadcrumbs in his hand. The fear-crazed chicken hobbled toward Stalin and clung to his trousers. The dictator threw some breadcrumbs to the bird, who followed him around the room. Stalin turned to his commissars and stated the lesson of his horrific event: “This is the way to rule the people. Did you see how that chicken followed me for food, even though I had caused it such torture? People are like that chicken. If you inflict inordinate pain on them they will follow you for food the rest of their lives.”</p></p>
