        <p>I'm laughing from my quarenteen hole 5k miles from home.So I've traveled about 8k miles since this pandemic started.5k by plane 3k by car.I've had to go to multiple major cities.One or two hot spots.Only observed the mask mandate where other people were.And only quarenteened once where it was forced.For the test to fly I was negative.</p>
<p>I intend to travel  5k miles again in a few months and tack on 5k more at the begining of 2021.Observing restitctions where I'm forced to.</p>
<p>Some people are teachers,nurses,or fire fighters.It's what they do for a work and it's their calling.Traveling is the same for me...and I'd still be doing it if their was bodies in the streets.</p>

        <p>That sub is marginally less cucked than it was when I used to be a member in another Reddit-life. </p>
<p>They are the most fearful and least intrepid group of global travelers in history and most of them know so little about how to make money while traveling that they go home in shame after about 6 months. </p>
<p>They have no capacity for independent thought whatsoever and it's a miracle that these "free thinkers" even managed to push back against this garbage. A couple of years back, they'd have been all for a permanent travel ban to prevent Covid.</p>

        <p>I've never done consulting, written an ebook, or hung out with other nomads abroad. It feels very incestuous.</p>
<p>It's not actually a great life. Lots of loneliness. It's probably great if you have a partner but most don't. This should probably be a requirement for mental health.</p>
<p>Also, low paying job when you're a nomad just seems stupid. Then you can't even afford the requisite $1,500+ (in non-Covid) times to stay independently in an apartment in Europe.</p>

        <p>I avoid anyone who starts with "I'm a digital nomad". I am OK with people who suddenly realize mid-conversation after mentioning they're a programmer, a business owner, whatever (but something concrete not "blogger" or "entrepreneur" - that's as bad as "digital nomad") that they are, in fact, a digital nomad. </p>
<p>Though most people seem to prefer "location independent professional" now because the digital nomad scene is full of such low quality human beings. </p>
<p>I've been on the road for 20 years-ish now. I'm spending $1,500+ on an apartment in fucking Manila at the moment... the only reason we're not back in Europe is that we need to get married, and that means my soon to be ex-wife needs to get the paperwork done on her end and Covid is in the way.</p>

<p>Yeah, it's hard to know where the money is coming from with most of these these people. They lie and tell you some narrative that only an idiot would believe. Great video that explains this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKh-K_pHg7w</p>
<p>&rt; "location independent professional"</p>
<p>I've heard this term before. I'm going to start using it.</p>
<p>That's a long time! There are some advantages in traveling during Covid times. I contacted over 20 Airbnb's attempting to negotiate a deal. It was at the beginning of the pandemic so most thought tourism would come back in a few months. But I eventually found someone. I was in NL but returned to the US because being in Europe since January was killing my mood.</p>

        <p>We actually got a decent deal on this place, to be fair. It is Airbnb (I actually prefer not to use them but the difference in the Phils between Airbnb and <a href="https://booking.com">booking.com</a> etc. is so big that I can't justify paying for my prejudice) and given that we're trapped in the house 24 hours a day running the A/C 24/7 plus a bunch of other stuff means we're costing the landlord an insane amount in electricity. He's a pretty good guy about it too - though he's probably seething on the inside. </p>
<p>I never set out with the intention of wandering the world, I took an expat contract and when it expired I tried to set up a bricks and mortar business which didn't go so well (came very close to making me filthy rich before collapsing into a pile of nothing, mind you) and then I started freelancing and haven't really looked back. I am nearing the end of the road now, though, I do want to head back towards home... but only once my partner is able to come with me.</p>
