<title>I thought my school might not be too bad. This was sent out yesterday. I wish I could take the year off, but I never wanted to or had any gap year plan, so here I am a week before school starts.</title>

<p>These posts from college kids are sad. But also show the devastating effects of... public school, I guess? They are too scared to do anything else. Find your courage, ya’ll! You’re going to need it.</p>

        <p>To hell with the scholarship. Strike while the iron is hot! (The hot iron is not the inane and bubble-overpriced university system.) There are going to be neat opportunities coming on the other side of this insanity, and I cannot see how any of them have anything to do with a bachelors degree. Even in STEM / IT stuff, which is radically over-saturated. The Marxists seem to be going full-woke where being good at something would be bad, and the reactionaries are all going meat-and-potatoes tradesman. There's going to be a UBI coming at some point, so the question is: if you are not going to be okay with the UBI, how are you going to separate UBI-paid house-bound internet slaves from their money? There will be many ways to do it. Find one that will be fun for you and shoot for it. </p>

<p>EDIT: This is not a time for cowardice in action. If you have an inclination, go at it with all of your might. The same thing with your disinclination to being complicit with this insanity at this level. (And paying very good money for it.)</p>

        <p>I spent a good chunk of the four years worrying about how I was going to make money. Instead of just being out there making it (and learning how to invest sensibly and EARLY).</p>
<p>Many of my classes at my flagship state university were taught by TAs. Some with quite limited English (it was literally hard to understand the materials).</p>
<p>I made $27,000/year my first real professional job out of school... that was 2013 so whatever that is in today’s dollars. </p>
<p>I now make literally 5-6x that working for myself in an industry that doesn’t require a degree. And I work for myself.</p>
<p>I wish I had spent those years traveling and meeting all kinds of people and growing into myself and my confidence. I wish I had <em>read</em> more (and more deeply) and studied/memorized less. I wish I’d had more adventures instead of being chained to college and internships.</p>
<p>I had a full tuition scholarship but still ended up with $25k of debt because my part time job didn’t cover dorms and living expenses, nor the unpaid internships they told me I had to take to “make it.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t worth it. If your degree is going to be “undecided” or liberals arts anything, REALLY stop and think about it.</p>

        <p>Maybe the schools have just upped the excuses they can use to do things more easily than before, like kick out trouble makers, is what I suspect because I STOPPED  believing in the sincerity of public health like back in the 1970's. I know certain corporations "own" schools too and have their agendas.</p>
<p>If I were college freshman age right now, knowing what I know, I would move wherever I needed to for an OUTDOOR job in which nobody bothers with face diapers. I would work off the back of a garbage truck and I am female. So many ways to learn more in the world than one could sitting in class. Maybe somewhere in the US, Red Cross volunteers are badly needed, like from the hurricane. </p>
<p>I want you to know that the most important thing college does for most people is NETWORKING. You have a chance to create a strong network of professional associations, and use job placement services your whole life. The security theater is effectively flummoxing how students form social bonds. I would seriously consider giving college the finger and finding a Habitat for Humanity or other volunteer work to build those connections and learn something useful, maybe take an online course or two, if time, to work slowly toward a degree needed for a "career". Whatever, just don't accrue student debt you will regret.</p>
<p>These days I am teaching myself chemistry with some old college thrift store texts.</p>

        <p>Well, then you have to make the best of it, I guess. That is scary, but wow, look at all the tips we get from online sources on navigating these violations of our constitution. I think a lot about the population just entering college this year. That is why I caught your post. Take it one day at a time and realize every day reveals to you what you need to know to survive, so don't be nervous. Sit back and watch and think for yourself at every step and you will get your education, believe me.</p>

        <p>I've heard other people mention scholarships as a reason to go even when they don't want to. I'll admit I  don't know the rules, but I'd be surprised if there aren't a million reasons to allow deferrals right now.</p>
