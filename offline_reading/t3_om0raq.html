        <p>The sad thing is that you're probably the only one who bothered to read the pamphlet.  It's crazy and depressing how easily the globalists manipulated the masses.</p>

<p>Picture #2: It's not a news flash that the older you get the higher the risk to die, as that is that way to EVERYTHING since the beginning of time.</p>
<p>Picture #3: No, it says "high risk of complications and death", not "high risk of death". And they also compare the risk of the virus vs the risk of vaccination and the fact that the risk with the virus vastly higher than the risk with the vaccine. </p>
<p>Picture #4: It prevents you from getting sick, as in it also means you don't die from it, or get long term damages etc.</p>
<p>Picture #5a: Again, in other words it also stop death, long term damages etc from happening as you don't get sick from the virus. Which also means you not letting the virus copy itself in your body risking it to mutate into a new strain thats deadlier, more contagious and/or more resistant.</p>
<p>Picture #5b: If you need vax passport depends on national/local restrictions, and if you mean vax passport to travel to another country, that will be dependent if that country have as a national/local restrictions.</p>

        <p>I go back to this: Why take a vaccine that at best is 50% effective (and maybe the other 50% can injure or kill you?) while the virus itself has a .1% death rate among the under 65 and healthy?</p>
