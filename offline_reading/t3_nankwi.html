    <strong>My father is getting vaccinated next week and I am literally terrified</strong>
    <p><p>He has already had the virus but now wants to get the vaccine so he can travel normally (travels a lot for work so I get it), but I am terrified for him because my family has a history of heart problems and he is fat as fuck. I don't even know what to do or think I am literally so afraid something is going to happen and I can't talk him out of it. Just makes me so fucking angry, am still hoping he changes his mind ...</p></p>

        <p>Would you really behave this way with your own father?  I'd fight tooth and nail to stop mine from getting a vaccine I thought would kill him.  It's his choice, but is still impacts him, his wife, his kids, his grandchildren, and he should be reminded of such, repeatedly, before making a stupid mistake.</p>

        <p>I would behave this way, and I did, with my own father. Me pushing him not to get the injection would be equivalent to him trying to push me to get it, because he thinks it would save me and my family. I give him and my family advice, but in the end it's their choice and we're just all going to have to live with the consequences.</p>

        <p>Different philosophies I suppose.  I would expect a family member to exert (an appropriate amount of) pressure for anything they thought would impact their health or those around them.  (This applies to friends as well.)  I would expect my parents to pressure me to get vaccinated if they thought it would keep me alive to take care of my children, etc.  For me, if you care about someone, you care enough to push them to make better decisions.  The extreme example is the once-trendy intervention concept, "you're screwing up your life, we're here to make you get your shit together."</p>
<p>Everyone is capable of making bad decisions, sometimes catastrophically so.  Those nearby who can help, should.</p>

        <p>Oh, lookie here. An "idealist" that thinks it's okay to shove their morality on others, to the point of obsession. </p>
<p>/u/Pi3_14159265358979 is absolutely right, and it's pathetic and sad people in this sub are downvoting him. Hypocrites. If it was opposite, and his dad was trying to force him to get vaccinated, everyone here would be foaming at the mouth. But nah, let's try to be moral crusaders, just on the <em>opposite</em> end instead of just allowing adults to make their own decisions for their health, even if it comes at a cost. Why? Because <strong>that's</strong> freedom, not the oppressive "LOL BUT ITS FOR THEIR SAFETY" trash I see you peddling, portlander.</p>

        <p>Parents should absolutely encourage their kids to do what they think is best for them.  It's what parenting is about.  Force is a more nuanced term when applied to kids of various ages, of course.  The argument reduced to the absurd would go "your friend doesn't want to wear a seatbelt while driving drunk home from a party, do you let them because it's their choice, or try to convince them they're making bad decisions?"  We all make bad decisions, and that is our right, but with those we care about, we also try to help them make better decisions, as is our right.  </p>
<p>To wit, this is my approach to life, and it's my choice, so by your logic you should let me make it and back the fuck off, or you're just a simple hypocrite.</p>

<p>There's a difference between stating your piece to someone, and hounding them to death. You seem to be implying the latter is fine as long as it's "moral". You're really no better than the opposition in that case. People should have more freedom to make their own decisions, and their mommies, daddies, kids, the government, church, whoever; should keep their noses out of their personal business.</p>

        <p>I weigh the risk of bad outcome, severity of outcome, my personal connection with the person, authority over them and use that to determine the amount of force to exert.  What do you do?  (edit: also, odds of successful persuasion)</p>

        <p>You're right, of course, but again. His father is an adult, so it's up to him to make his own bed. A lot of people are stubborn and stupid, and they're just going to do what they want.

<p>My parents had it 3 months ago, both well into their 70s and neither in tip top health. Both overweight, both on blood pressure meds, Mom is at least pre-diabetic... co-morbidities, if you will.</p>

        <p>Both of my older parents got it with no issues whatsoever. Millions of people haven gotten this vaccine with no problems. I hate the way that the vaccine is being pushed, and I think being hesitant to get a new vaccine like this is reasonable, but I think some of the fear is a bit over the top.</p>

<p>I'm in a similar place. There's no benefit to this subreddit going to extremes either. We don't have to exaggerate, especially considering not one of us, anonymous on Reddit or face-to-face, owes anyone an explanation for anything related to this. We're all doing the best we can, and some of us will be wrong. In a couple of years, hopefully we can all be honest with ourselves about being wrong, or we can be ready to help "the other side" who were wrong.</p>

        <p>No one is going to extremes in this thread. Getting immediate bad side effects is a big possibility from these vaccines. It is like playing russian rulete. Maybe they will be fine maybe they won’t. We still don’t know if a year down the road that there won’t be side effects that show up all of a sudden. Everyone should be scared as hell of this vaccine. The Human population is being used as lab rats.</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry, that's a very tough situation to be in. Is there no way you can convince him of just watching a few videos or reading a few articles that show how dangerous these vaccines can be? I can link you some information if you'd like?</p>

        <p>Make amends with him, if the worst would happen. Of course, try to talk him out of it, but after that, have peace that it is his own decision. Each soul decides for him or herself. </p>
<p>It really is not worth it, taking the experimental gene therapy for an alleged pandemic of an alleged virus that has never even been isolated. But if people want to be stubborn, they will be stubborn.</p>

<p>Short and Sweet 'sourced proof'(i hope) that the PCR test is bunk</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------</p>
<p><a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/labmed/sections/virology/COVID-19%20Ct%20values_YNHH%20Aug.%202020%20_395430_36854_v1.pdf">https://medicine.yale.edu/labmed/sections/virology/COVID-19%20Ct%20values_YNHH%20Aug.%202020%20_395430_36854_v1.pdf</a></p>
<p>This is proof for you. Every single slide has some element of proof that Ct being used is commonly over 40.</p>
<p>Here at this link, pg 4, fig 1 is very strong evidence that anything over 38 is pure noise: <a href="https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/ncov/main/2020/09/cycle-threshold-values-sars-cov2-pcr.pdf?la=en">https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/ncov/main/2020/09/cycle-threshold-values-sars-cov2-pcr.pdf?la=en</a></p>
<p>You are now backed into a corner. All you can do is demand more sources to verify Ct count, which WHO\CDC conspired NOT to collect outside special samples like we see in the two articles above, or refuse to accept what I have shown you. You have no rhetorical or scientific or logical escape from this.</p>
<p>Something to consider for everyone avoiding the vaccine</p>
<p>It is becoming increasingly apparent that the spike protein itself is toxic, not only does it have potential for prion disease, but also general neurotoxicity: </p>
<p><a href="https://carterheavyindustries.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/covid19-rna-based-vaccines-and-the-risk-of-prion-disease-1503.pdf">https://carterheavyindustries.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/covid19-rna-based-vaccines-and-the-risk-of-prion-disease-1503.pdf</a></p>
<p><a href="https://sdnn70.com/en/the-spike-proteins-of-covid-19-have-a-strong-neurotoxic-effect-with-severe-consequences/?fbclid=IwAR1gy4-5PJ35zMWJLTSC_N_GFKayr2YgGyAjcd9xI1ytcPs9tXWz-R06_ck">https://sdnn70.com/en/the-spike-proteins-of-covid-19-have-a-strong-neurotoxic-effect-with-severe-consequences/?fbclid=IwAR1gy4-5PJ35zMWJLTSC_N_GFKayr2YgGyAjcd9xI1ytcPs9tXWz-R06_ck</a></p>
<p>If you haven't been vaccinated but spend any time around those that have, you will be exposed to high amounts of this spike protein. It is not a coincidence that many women spending time around vaccinated women are also having period issues. </p>
<p>It is also not a coincidence that many people are becoming ill and developing covid symptoms after being vaccinated because what so many fail to realize is that <strong>many of the symptoms of covid are not due to the virus in it's totality, but due to the spike protein itself. Therefore, it would follow that reprogramming all cells in the body to generate this spike protein continually would lead to higher rates of disease, not just for those vaccinated, but to those spending time around them as well.</strong> </p>
<p>I speak from personal experience, my girlfriend that I live with got her first moderna shot a few weeks ago. Despite working in retail since last september, she never got symptomatic covid until after she got her shot. She got a full body rash 7 days from the shot, and 3 days after that was "the sickest i've been in 7 years". A few days after the worst of her sickness (high fever and cough) she developed a major rash at the injection site that wasn't there previously. </p>
<p>I never get sick, never get the flu, and never have worse than a cough or sore throat. But since she got vaccinated and then developed all the symptoms of covid, I have had a fever myself the past few days that won't seem to break. </p>
<p>I know I've had covid before because I was slightly ill and feeling down with a cough and sore throat last fall. </p>
<p>I think one of the biggest lies is that covid immunity wanes. <strong>It doesn't, but if the spike protein itself is being continually manufactured and attacking the body of the vaccinated person and the people living with/around them, we will see increases in "covid" as a result of this.</strong></p>
<p>It seems quite an ironic twist of fate. The doomers treat all of us that just want life to continue as it was before as walking biological bombs, just for they themselves to get "vaccinated" and become walking biological bombs themselves!</p>

        <p>Which is hilarious, suggesting CDC data is mostly fake, but trust the CDC in all they do, but you're right.  And it may not work, but it's one possible approach for someone you want to convince.  Another would be the compiled list of "x healthy person died y days after vaccination" that someone in here was compiling, because for most people, emotional anecdotes are more compelling than statistically meaningful data.</p>

        <p>A few things to think about:</p>
<p>1) If your father is overweight, has heart issues, and I assume is a bit older, he may be one of the people for which it is a good idea. Those are the ones Covid gets. </p>
<p>2) The bad outcomes rate is at very worst, no worse than  Covid itself.   Yes, one is self-inflicted, but the odds are still way in your favor. </p>
<p>3) The possibility of longer term issues is just that, a possibility.  Again it's just the same as the fear of the virus.   We don't know what will happen in the future in either case.  If you ever roll your eyes at people afraid of Covid because "yeah the survival rate is high, but we don't know how it will affect people in the future".  Well, same thing. </p>
<p>4) and in the end, what most of us are fighting for is the right to make a decision.  Respect other people's.</p>
<p>edit:  Fear is the real pandemic.</p>
