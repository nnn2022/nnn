    <strong>Seeing the Positive</strong>
    <p><p>Hello all. With governments around the world once again ramping up restrictions, and as we inch ever closer to the 1 year mark of intermittent COVID lockdowns around the world, it can seem like any momentum we may have had has been snatched off us. It can seem like all hope is lost, that the inevitable tyranny that was the norm throughout human history is returning, and worse, that blind followers are cheering it on. In times like these, it is easy to lose faith in humanity as a whole; to even become a misanthrope.</p>
<p>But if we zoom out a little, there are many positives to be seen. Firstly, and most importantly in my opinion,  whoever behind the scenes is "pulling the strings" or orchestrating these lockdowns, has significantly overplayed their hand with this pandemic. Many, many people have "woken up" to how biased the media is; trust is at an all time low. I have read posts of lifelong Democrats who would previously roll their eyes at Republicans claiming "fake news" who now are beginning to understand the bias of the media in pushing one-sided coverage on a variety of issues. Many independents and moderate republicans have gone from generally trusting of the media to what the establishment would flat-out call "conspiracy theorists" over the past 10 months. The change is stark; you can see people of all walks of life realising that the game is rigged: the illusion of liberty in the West has been shattered for a significant number of people. When they say there will be no "going back to normal" they are right, people are different now, they see things differently, and things are approaching fever pitch.</p>
<p><em>Everything was more stable 15 years ago, I felt safer. Things felt less "dark". ...Aren't things better when things are more stable? Why is all of this "red-pilling" a good thing?</em> Because, unfortunately, people only come to uncomfortable truths when things get painful. People will take the easy path, and for most, that was staying "plugged in", blue-pilled and blissfully ignorant. The truth is, for any real change to happen, something like this <em>needed</em> to occur. People needed to be jolted awake in order to be made aware, and with the powers that be overplaying their hand to such an extent as they have, the change has occurred far too rapidly, and it's far too obvious for most reasonably rational-minded people to ignore any more. THIS is the positive of the pandemic, of the lockdowns, of the suffering. Because suffering brings growth, and we needed growth, we needed awareness, otherwise we would have been frogs slowly boiled alive by ever creeping social controls, surveillance, and loss of freedoms. </p>
<p>15 years ago you would have been laughed out of the room by most people for talking of a globalist "Great Reset". Positive change is happening at a rapid pace in the ideological zeitgeist, if only we zoom out from our current misery to see the big picture can we see all the positives. Every time they enforce another lockdown, attempt to force another vaccine on people, lie through their teeth like a telescreen spouting fake statistics, more and more people roll their eyes, more people wake up, the pressure builds and the cracks in the facade widen. You can see signs of this everywhere, if you switch off the news and the front page of reddit. Things are changing. It's not where you are at that matters, it's where you are headed.</p>
<p>Strive on diligently. Don't give up.</p></p>

        <p>15 years ago you were reading the morning paper. Of course you feel less safe now because there are bits of information that you could only dream about learning, and now we can find out the answer so fast that we do not need to analyze ehy the answer is what it is.</p>
<p>So, I liked the energy and the spirit of the post. Clearly done by someone who cares. But the whole idea that there are strings to pull or that everything is a setup makes you appear like a solipsist.</p>
