    <strong>So, what's the plan?</strong>
    <p><p>I've been on this sub for a while now and I agree with most of the things shared here, but I'm not seeing any real solutions to this massive mess we're in.</p>
<p>How does one stand up to government tyranny? Is it worth losing your job, education, access to public facilities by refusing the vaccine? When does this end and how can we make it end?</p>
<p>It seems like the choice is between complying or being excluded from society.</p>
<p>Now, I am in no way supportive of the vaccine and I'm completely against making it mandatory, but it's not like the government cares about what I (or many of you) have to say! They don't care if we resist or disobey - they will simply continue with their agenda.</p>
<p>Please help me understand what it is we're trying to achieve by not complying, because it seems like we're only delaying the inevitable.</p></p>

        <p>One way to help is to send and share these messages. Once we are the majority we can make the 
 Government change. We just need to keep spreading ours messages and get enough people. I’ll already sent this subreddit to some of my peers and they all agree with me. If we don’t act nothing will happen.</p>

        <p>Don't you think that it's an unattainable goal? I mean it feels like most people have already picked their side and I doubt that many are willing to change their minds in fear of being seen as a "conspiracy theorist" or an "antivaxxer"</p>

        <p>I don’t think so. I believe there are many people in the center who are still figuring this thing out. After all, covid was unprecedented and many people are concerned and confused as to where this might lead. I’m sure only the extremists are going to be seen as “antivaxx”. For me, I only care for the safety of my family and peers and that’s not any kind pf conspiracy theory.</p>

        <p>I hope you're right, but it already feels like any criticism or scepticism of the vaccine is labelled antivax due to the media brainwashing and people on both sides are becoming more divided. It's looking very ugly right now and I don't see a scenario where both sides calmly debate one another to come to an agreement.</p>

        <p>Do you truly believe that such a movement could make a difference? Here in the UK we already had an official petition to outlaw discrimination based on vaccination status and the government responded with a big "fuck you".</p>

        <p>Time for action, no use we rely on any gov anymore we the team here start a blockchain website which is decentralized and unstoppable and can’t take down and we spread the awareness and because it is unstoppable there will be huge crowd and we will out reach and MSM and once the count reaches beyond the number with authentic request we can write official letters to embassy and government offices and say why this is not ethical, in a democracy words of thousands of people need to be heard and if not take down the damn government, on a sad note I live in Indonesia and government here is mandated vaccine and my office is a police for us</p>

        <p>I think the delay is the fight. Our current president said he was a uniter of people. He said he would work on both sides of the aisle. I personally don't want him to take the credit for vaccinating all Americans. It's kind of petty, but I think one simple thing I can do is hold out. The administration can't hold out forever. This will end poorly, but until those previously infected with coof are taken into consideration I think this will remain necessary.</p>
<p>This whole period of time has been one-sided. Time yields more information, and time is something that the white house doesn't have in abundance. They can keep attacking rights. They can keep being divisive. We can continue to look at all sides and make the best decision for ourselves. This is our right. The answers will come in due time. We just need to be patient.</p>

        <p>I will deal with that when it comes. However, I don't live in France. To fire me for not vaccinating but complying with recommended health measures in order to work is discrimination, and I would willfully take that on.</p>
<p>There hasn't been much stir in the US about removing public services or healthcare for unvaccinated person's. To do so is a violation of human rights and freedoms according to the US Constitution and Bill of Rights. I am not worried on that front, either.</p>
<p>Another side to that coin is the economic ecosystem that exists around us. If I am denied employment, services, and healthcare I will no longer patronize the businesses that I would normally patronize. As I assume I would not be the only person in this situation I believe that would reduce the number of workers available to make money for businesses. Also, income for healthcare providers, and public services would be driven down. This would likely inflate the cost to customers who have complied with the vaccination requirement. Everything would be upside down. I find it unlikely that imprisonment and refusal of service will come to this country.</p>

        <p>You have a point, I hope it all works out without any of the scary Nazi dystopia shit. The only thing I'm worried about is access to education here in the UK. I'm getting my first shot tomorrow just so I don't become a second class citizen, as it's believed that universities will require students to be vaccinated to participate in in-person teaching.</p>
