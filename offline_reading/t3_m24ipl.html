        <p>They are doing asymptomatic testing of kids, again.  Not sure if those are counting towards case counts.</p>

        <p>I think that's it. I even heard Dr. Williams say on TV that the numbers would go up a little due to that. I wonder how many are false positives, though. I would normally say quite a few, but they did the same type of testing in Ottawa and only found one positive, so I dunno.</p>

        <p>Asymptomatic cases are bullshit.  They are either cold positives, like the PCR detecting some previous contact with the virus but the person is no longer infectious, or are bullshit anyway because asymptomatic transmission has never been shown to be a thing.  We should not be subjecting kids with no symptoms to testing.  When it was the swab test last year, it was basically child abuse. Actually it still is.</p>

        <p>I did read on some Ontario page that the PCR test could pick up viral matter as old as three months, which was concerning because that could lead to fraudulent data. </p>
<p>I don't think kids should ever have something stuck up their nose like that. My Mom said that she never would have made my sister and I get it, unless we really wanted to, and I can't see any reason why we would've. She said she would've just kept us home for 14 days, if necessary.</p>

        <p>I'd like to know in all this time what kid, teacher or family member has gotten seriously ill or even mildly sick.  I would say the asymptomatic testing is the evil fear mongering influence of the teachers' union but unfortunately it seems to be a product of the ontario govt as well.  Rotten, all of them.</p>

        <p>I heard of one educational worker who died in the GTA, quite a long time back. I don't know if they were a teacher or not. I don't think any kids died. The kid who was sickest that I heard of was my sister's boyfriend's son, who had a really sore throat and a bad cough, but he didn't have to go to the hospital.</p>

        <p>It’s literally written on their website that they don’t test for covid before labelling something a covid death https://www.ontario.ca/page/how-ontario-is-responding-covid-19#foot-7</p>
