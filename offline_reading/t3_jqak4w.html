        <p>There’s no way they can justify this and continue to shame people. I have no problem with people celebrating Biden winning, just as I have no problem with BLM protests, anti lockdown protests, or Trump rallies. But if the media wants to demonize certain things and not others that’s what I have a problem with.</p>

        <p>Of course they can—they’re democrats, and we’ve always been at war with EastAsia, and Oceana is our ally in that fight.</p>

        <p>Looks like everyone is wearing a mask though. Similar to all the BLM protests in New York City. Almost everyone had a mask and there was basically no increase in cases within the city.</p>

        <p>Well my simple friend, you see you don’t actually breath out only viruses. You breath out vapor, little droplets of liquid, that hold the virus. It’s like when it’s brrrrrr cold out and your breath condenses. That cloud you see isn’t millions of viruses putting on a jacket to warm up (silly!) it’s the moisture in your breath condensing. </p>
<p>So, the mask stops the droplets and aerosolled breath, which holds the virus.</p>

        <p>No, most of those are inside. Studies show that outdoor transmission rates are SIGNIFICANTLY lower.  And because not everyone at a stadium will be outside the entire time, a more limited amount of people would make sense. </p>
<p>Masks are not 100%
Outside is not 100%
Social distancing is not 100%</p>
<p>But you take parts of those and combine them and you’ll be pretty damn safe. So outside with a mask? Yeah... you’re generally fine. Outside and standing far apart from eachother? Yeah... you’re generally fine.</p>

        <p>I really couldn’t care less about football games or stadium architecture. </p>
<p>But outdoor classes? Sure. Maybe shift the year so classes are held in the summer. Gets cold in the north in the winter. Snow and all that. </p>
<p>If everyone wore masks then yeah sure, have outdoor concerts. The probably is that due to people like you, they don’t wear masks. So because you act like children, you have to be treated like children. Now no one gets to have fun because you have some selfish delusion that by you refusing masks that you’re some brave patriot when in reality you’re just throwing a temper tantrum.</p>

        <p>Hi, I'm smarter than you. I also am a "coastal elite" who holds a pretty prominent job in the media from which you gather all your "expertise" on immunology and epidemiology. I also live in a state and city with a mandatory mask order which has been in place for over six months. I wear a mask every day, everywhere I go in public. Cases are still rising in my state. </p>
<p>You aren't smart. You aren't "the adult in the room". You're a moron who doesn't think for themself and, worse, thinks they can mandate what others can and cannot do. You are everything wrong not only with this country, but the world at large. You are people like me's cross to bear. You are a leech, a fool, a sanctimonious imbecile and I hope, dearly, that someday you will wake up and think critically.</p>

        <p>See, the difference is that because for whatever bizarre reason you people think masks don’t do anything, that anyone advocating for them is “virtue signalling” or being “sanctimonious” or anything else silly like that. </p>
<p>However the truth is that I, and the vast majority of scientifically minded people, see the benefit of masks provide and want to do our part to help our community as a whole by wearing them.</p>
<p>You guys one the other hand want to help your community by... I don’t know... putting a bizarre emphasis on your right to not wear a mask in some deluded guise of “freedom and muh rights”. I mean sure, but why? Even if it’s true that gOvErNmEnT bAd, why fight it? Why not just say “well, it’s not 100% preventative but it helps a bit and I think we should listen to the experts and wear masks”.</p>
<p>Instead it’s this weird pseudo-anarchist “FRRREEEEEDOM! THE GOVERNMENT CANT TELL ME WHAT TO DO!!!”  It’s a strange hill to die on (no pun intended.) put your energy elsewhere. You guys have no grey area: the government telling you to put on a mask is the same as the government telling you to “hail comrade”... you think you’re fighting against a government that’s going to throw you into a gulag. </p>
<p>You’re also the same people extremely angry about shutdowns etc. How can you both be against lockdowns AND masks at the same time? Choose one guys. To have wanton blind expression of “Freedom (TM)” is not productive at all.</p>

        <p>I participated in LA BLM protests. How much masks were worn depended on the area and type of protest: people would mask consistently at a stationary rally in a hipster neighborhood, but at the big marches people would typically start off wearing masks and then discard them as the day wore on. Also, some people spontaneously hugged me at those protests. It helped to restore my faith in humanity.</p>

        <p>These rats are trying to impose their own values onto you. They hate visiting their family on thanksgiving/Christmas, so clearly those are Superfluous holidays that you can live without. They hate going out to restaurants/bars/clubs, so those Nonessential activities will be Canceled for the next 2-3 business years. </p>
<p>But Biden winning? They have been waiting for this moment their entire lives!!! It’s finally His Turn!!!! So when cases inevitably go up in a few weeks (virus gonna virus), they’ll shriek at you how it’s ABSOLUTLEY IMPERATIVE you DON’T travel for thanksgiving this year. <strong>These people EXPECT you to sacrifice your thanksgiving and Christmas so they can celebrate right now.</strong> Disgusting</p>

        <p>I agree with what you said but I would only question the spike of actual cases. I don’t think this virus is as infectious as portrayed and given the media favour to the left, even if there was a spike they wouldn’t tell you about it. Was there a spike after BLM? I didn’t remember anything like it. </p>
<p>So it’s a pretty stupid paradox cause either cases are not spiking and it should make us think or cases are spiking but media is not mentioning when left wants to party which also should make us think. </p>
<p>And just in case I don’t like right just as much but at least they are not hypocrite :)</p>

        <p>Honestly it does sound like you're scared. No doubt you've been sick many times before in your life? At yet now you are so committed to surrounding yourself with bubble wrap.
What does other people have to do with your mum though? Go get a test and if you're negative then go see her. You're grasping at straws a bit.</p>

        <p>Yeah I've had a chest infection before where I was literally drowning in my own goo. I'm 100% sure I never want to experience that again and am totally cool with wearing a mask if it means I don't wake up drowning at 3am again. That experience IS terrifying. I am more angry that I can't go into certain places because some jerk is coughing with his mask down and angry that I can't do activities because a few people don't care enough about me to take precautions because of their freeeeedoms and now our cases are so high right now. It's so individualistic it makes me sad. We could be a community, but it's everyone for themselves out there.</p>
<p>But it's not about just me... It's about protecting the vulnerable so they are less likely to get sick and die. Like your family. Like my family. My mom can't go out. She has been stuck in a house for months because the people around her area refuse to wear masks. She is literally forced to give up what makes her happy and sane for fear of severe medical consequences. If everyone wore masks and gave a crap she could do more, you know? I'm willing to inconvenience myself to help others and it sounds an awful lot like people like you aren't willing to do the same. </p>
<p>And the tests have false negatives. I'd be a lot more confident with a negative test, but when, again, she will probably literally die if she gets this due to her thousand health issues, it's not really something she wants to risk. The chance of it happening are slim IF we wear masks and get tested and I do understand that. But if I'm wrong I just killed my mom and that does scare her. So I can't hug my mom for many more months to come.</p>

        <p>I am so fucking sick of this line about "community ". When I was trying to kill myself repeatedly this spring due to social isolation, people like you weren't checking up on me and offering me kind words. People like you were calling complete lack of human contact an "inconvenience", lying about us so you could make fun of us on social media, and saying you could not "in good conscience" have anything to do with "reckless" people like me. I didn't have family or an existing "pod" to quarantine with, I <em>needed</em> to make new friends to hang out with, and was consistently shamed for trying by people like you. But guess what? I found my people. A <em>real</em> community. And we party, we have a good time and we let people make their own decisions about whether to mask instead of assuming they're privileged fucks and pulling guilt trips on them.</p>

        <p>You just assumed a lot about me that isn't true. I have no friends here.  I just started a new job - my dream job - five weeks before the state shut down. I lost both of my jobs, all of my income, and all of my social outlets in the span of a week only a few months after moving to a new area. I spent a very long time in a very bad headspace, similar to yours from the sound of it. It. Sucked. A. Fuckton. I handled it poorly and lost my two friends that lived in other cities. I did eventually get one of my jobs back, but that took a while and I'm still working from home with almost zero contact with people. Shoot even my family is an iffy thing. My mom can't think clearly so she says a lot of absolutely terrible things to me.  I do have a partner and frankly I'm not sure I'd be in the same spot right now without him. So I do get where you are coming from. Before my partner I've lived with pretty crippling social isolation for years. 9/10 on the mental pain scale. </p>
<p>I do want to take a minute to say I'm really truly sorry to hear how this has been rough on you. There is a lot of suffering this year that I wish on nobody. </p>
<p>I found a good therapist, got some help and some medication adjustments. I spent hours and days and weeks trying to find friends online. I even threw a virtual party that one person showed up to. It sucks. But I keep trying to find things online to do with people. You can still connect remotely. It's not easier than in person, but it is possible. I'm still pretty damn miserable,  though. I want to go out and explore and do things. I also care about not getting other people sick. My suffering does not give me leave to stop caring about the wellbeing of others. It's not either or. </p>
<p>I'm happy you found people who care for you. I'm hoping mine are coming soon. You aren't limited to doing things in person with them and I do hope you consider doing some things virtually. It also costs you nothing to mask up if you are hanging out in person.</p>

        <p>I almost killed myself because I was in a new city with limited social interaction. I talked to people on the phone every day and it didn’t help. Virtual is bullshit. It is not social interaction. But of course, depressed and suicidal peoples lives don’t matter, only people who die from covid. I should have just sucked it up and gleefully embraced the technocratic dystopia of conducting all interaction through social media, put up a profile picture of me wearing a mask, and liked it. I might go throw up now.</p>

        <p>“I’m angry that I can’t do activities because a few people don’t care enough about me to take precautions.” </p>
<p>It’s NO ones obligation to wear a mask to “protect” people like you. </p>
<p>YOU are the ONLY one responsible for your health. </p>
<p>NO ONE ELSE. period. </p>
<p>That whole line is so pathetic. Oh this person isn’t wearing their mask so I’m too afraid to go outside :( 
Like how much of your real actual life are you going to miss out on with this mindset? </p>
<p>Id rather to all the things I love and take a RISK - because that’s what you do everyday of your life without even realizing it - rather than die isolated, alone, scared, etc. </p>
<p>Have you ever gotten in a car? Do you think about getting into a car accident every-time you drive anywhere? Life has risks - yes even outside of the big bad coronavirus. Deal with it.</p>

<p>That's why I try my best to protect myself. I wish people like you actually cared if I get hurt or not. I like having a community that gives a crap about my wellbeing. But because people like you will not extend even the simplest courtesy to your fellow people, you endanger so many vulnerable lives and make mine harder for trying to do what I consider right. </p>
<p>So go ahead and tell me that it's okay if people like my mom die because you want to take a risk with your own safety. It's not just your safety. The more cases in the community, the more likely it is that vulnerable people will get hurt.</p>
<p>Why is it always about me? Really what is so bad with giving a crap about my coworker who has cancer or my neighbor who has an autoimmune disorder? My aunt who is 75 with Parkinsons and is homebound. Her brother is totally okay taking risks with his personal safety, but he lives with her and is her caregiver. It's not just about me. Don't you get that I'm trying to protect you, too? It's not about one individual. This is bigger than that. It's about all of us.</p>
<p>You make me sad.</p>

        <p>Agreed. These people take the idea of an individualistic society to a radical and extreme degree. They don't even realize that they are working against their own interests because if people would have just locked down in the first place we might be able to interact normally by now, look at New Zealand. These are also people that truly don't understand basic sanitation science. They don't understand that wearing a mask prevents outgoing disease, not incoming meaning that in an interaction both people need to wear a mask for protection to function.</p>
<p>It makes me sad.</p>

<p>The truth is if media never spoke about it we would never ever hear about coronavirus and NOTICE IT. You allowing yourself to be in fear makes you vulnerable and sensitive to that threat. More youre scared of something more likely you’re gonna attract it to your life. Every friend of mine who is as paranoid as you keeps getting sick since all this happened. They don’t have Covid but they get flu and other shit every damn month. I haven’t been sick since 2018 and I’m not your book example of a healthy lifestyle BUT I’m not scared and I know this threat is just a staged problem. Start living your life and start attracting good things thinking about it all the time won’t do you any good!!! I’m saying that just so you will have lighter life and mind in peace!</p>

        <p>Yes and pulling masks down to shout and chant</p>
<p>But no these are never super spreader events. Gotta worry about small gatherings and kids birthday parties. </p>
<p>In all honestly I don’t know what the majority of those celebrating think, maybe they are not hypocrites. However i think it’s hypocritical the media totally ignores covid for some events while shaming others.</p>

        <p>I have noticed this blatant hypocrisy when it comes to mass gatherings. In the US  anti lockdown protesters were condemned as selfish disease spreaders but BLM protests were not. Surely in a real pandemic people would not be selective in attacking mass gatherings if they can spread disease.</p>

Yesterday, this very same woman who relentlessly shamed people for gathering in public posted a breathless cheer about how many people were celebrating in the streets.  No self-awareness at all.</p>
