    <strong>IF WE THE PEOPLE AREN'T GOING BACK TO NORMAL IN 2021, THERE NEVER WILL BE ANY NORMAL FOR THE NEXT GENERATIONS TO COME.</strong>
    <p><p>Don't you think it will happen in 2022 or ever after</p>
<p>The next revolution that will come  is manufactured and every dissident will be to blame. They write their own history, they will have some names to blame, some countries to take as an example or savior. Who knows what will happen.</p>
<p>In the end its just the story they will tell to the next generations they led in this planned future that matters. Those who come next won't worry about the changes we see today, its not the 'end of the world' but it sure is your new world order, the end of our society and humanity as we know it.</p>
<p>Those who come next will probably just like us, not know any better and just go with the flow. Don't you think you'll ever go back to normal, they're shaping the futureMost of us on here know everyone already accepted the future</p>

        <p>We have to go back to normal. They say that due to lock down carbon footprint has gone down 7% and un is already bullshitting we have to keep that rate for 10 years to avoid climate catastrophe. </p>
<p>They don't want this to end. 2 weeks, 2 months, new strain, vaccine, then climate, then this, then that. Come on, why is it not obvious?! </p>
<p>They should be sued, collectively in a court of law of highest order for the human rights abuses and forced to pay compensation to every man, woman and child that has suffered from their policies in any way.</p>

        <p>I truly believe it goes hand in hand. Look up progressive terms like doughnut economics, carbon taxes, refusing to build housing to reduce CO2 emissions and God knows what else. 
I think climate change is just a Troyan horse they use to swindle even more money from people and gain more control.</p>

        <p>Of course it's a trojan horse. Its easy for them to blame climate change because it's believable. The real deal is control of everything by the state. Covid and climate change are the trojan horses they'll use to usher in their "great fraud"</p>
<p>They're trying to use Covid to trigger widespread economic collapse.</p>

        <p>Correct. The left has been building the foundation for socialism for decades. This is the ignition point they’ve been dreaming of. There will be no return to normal. The economy will not recover. Your community will not recover. This is the end of western civilization as we previously knew it.</p>

        <p>This while the 15 biggest boats pollute as much as every single car on the world, but it is you and your freedom who is to be blamed! :)</p>
<p>Or the top 100 coorporations polluting for around 70% of global population. </p>
<p>But who do you think has enough money to buy our governments and change laws to their desires?</p>
<p>All they are doing in conditioning the people to live like a bunch of poor slaves. We will have just enough to survive and go to work. The generation before mine could sustain a whole family and buy a house with one person working a casual job. And I know you'll tell me it is what it is. Thats how conditioning works.</p>

        <p>They're not willing to follow or enforce their own laws, and a lot of places around the world have had their courts shut down since last May making legal recourse impossible. </p>
<p>Like, the only real option we might have is protesting or violence and I don't see the latter as being particularly effective and I don't even know if the former will even work with how vehemently the media is supporting everything going on.</p>

        <p>I envy Floridians.</p>
<p>I'm in Canada. My entire family has adopted the doomer mentality except my wife (thank god) and my mother.</p>
<p>But what good does that do us when nobody wants to gather? Nobody is willing to entertain a discussion that questions the narritive. We went over to my brother's place for Christmas and I almost ruined dinner by pointing out that politicians don't follow thier own rules.... We were only "allowed" 10 guests. My mother opted to stay home because she was bitter my brother told her that my step sister couldnt come.... We just can't have ONE EXTRA PERSON right? I pointed out that it's all arbitrary because we LITERALLY just visited them...</p>
<p>I'm trying to be hopeful. I'm trying to wake people up around me... But sometimes it just feels so hopeless.</p>

        <p>I remember seeing preachers on street corners in years past and thinking they were crazy. Not so much anymore. Perhaps they, too, are simply trying to wake people up, despite the vast majority of the people that hear them rejecting their message and giving it no further thought.</p>
<p>It’s important that you make your voice heard in some way, but don’t make it the main focus of your life. Going against the grain is hard enough without being ridiculed by almost everyone you meet. People with eyes to see will understand.</p>
<p>I get your frustration. Many of my family and friends either don’t want to hear my warnings or don’t believe them. If you focus your energy on changing your own circumstances, then they will have an example to follow, if and when they choose to do so. But you can’t make that choice for them, as painful as it is to accept.</p>

        <p>This is great advice. Something I've already been trying to live by..</p>
<p>I can't fight with every Wal Mart greeter. I can't fight with the 16 year old kid at the grocery store. I know the guy at that has station has to tell me to wear the stupid thing... I'm not willing to cause a scene and get the cops involved for something that's easy enough to do. </p>
<p>I ordered a bunch of masks online and they came the other day.</p>

<li>FEAR is the real virus</li>
<li>this is a psy-op</li>
<li>it's not about safety it's about compliance</li>

<li>F*CK your new normal</li>

<p>And a few others... You get the point.</p>
<p>I'm going to put them on only when I am asked to do so. If it makes one person think .. itl be worth the cost.</p>

        <p>You don't actually have to comply, just explain to the security at the stores you go to that you are a high-risk individual who can't wear a mask and they'll leave you alone. </p>
<p>Don't argue with anyone who gives you shit for not wearing a mask, but DON'T comply to them either. Just go maskless and tune them out/sidestep them when they start. Do not *ever* verbally engage with one of them in public. </p>
<p>The vast majority of people have already made up their minds to either wholly embrace the goings-on or to comply out of fear. Do not be the latter, that's a much more dangerous position to be in.</p>
<p>Just walking around maskless will do much more to convince people to rebel than convincing yourself you're helping out the very people who have chosen to go along with everything with your compliance, you're not. You're reinforcing their assumptions and notions about what's going on by complying. You're only making the problem worse by doing that.</p>

        <p>I have a really bad feeling that a French Revolution style revolt may happen in some regions of the world in the coming year. The regions that it may happen in are California, New York, and the UK. The French Revolution is a good example of what happens when the government (King Louis XVI in that case) upsets almost their entire population.</p>

        <p>If the status quo continues then the regions of the world which don't have these restrictions will win out; over the long haul lockdown will mean very low marriage and birth rates, so the people and regions that embrace and impose it will literally be dying societies filled with mentally disturbed and increasingly dysfunctional people. The threat will naturally diminish over time. And that's assuming there isn't a popular uprising or revolution that ends it beforehand, a possibility I think you rule out too easily. In any case a social order as authoritarian as "hard lockdown" is simply not sustainable. One way or another it will end.</p>

<p>Also do you know of a country that isn't affected by the politics? And yes lockdown as we know them now will end, they will change and keep changing. It was quarantines first, whatever they call it. Don't think it wil lead us into something close to 'normal' any time soon</p>

        <p>Look dude, first of all you are probably assuming I am American. I’m belgian and live in Belgium.
English is my third language.</p>
<p>I don’t know what makes you think that all the goverments all over the world are trying to fake a pandemic. Now first of all, tell my why they would do that. And also explain to me how they would go on about doing that. Are they hiring actors to act like they are sick in filled hospitals? Are the nurses also actors? The doctors? I’m really curious how this all works in your mind. Please enlighten me.</p>
<p>I’m assuming you also think there is some world government that is making this happen? Then also please explain to me why new zealand and Australia are pretty much back to normal after hard lockdowns?</p>

        <p>Lol when the fuck did I advocate for anything? The flu deserves no attention which is all this is. I take down the caution tape at the park, I never wear a mask unless in a store and laugh at people who try to fear monger this bullshit.</p>

        <p>Look dude I don’t know if you realize but the flu doesn’t cause hospitals to be at full capacity at the peak of a epidemic. It doesn’t wipe out half the population of a retirement home. Covid does. It’s a bit different. That’s why lockdown, quarantine and wearing masks is not required to combat the flu because it is under control. Covid is not. You can keep living in your little rainbow world safe space. But you should really consider putting on your big boy pants and face the hard reality of these times.</p>

        <p>I’ve notice a pretty consistent trend with the fear mongering and doomers on Reddit. All of them are into video games which to me suggests they don’t really go out and experience the real world often enough. The hospitals are “at capacity” because they fired most of the staff bc “elective” procedures were cancelled.</p>

        <p>Nice personal attack while dodging all my arguments. Makes you seem very intelligent. And yes, the reason hospitals all around the globe are at capacity is because the staff is fired. Good thinking.</p>
