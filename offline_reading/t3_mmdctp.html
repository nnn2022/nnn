    <strong>Is new technology part of what's feeding hysteria?</strong>
    <p><p>If you have had the misfortune of turning the news on lately there is a constant drum beat of how the <a href="https://youtu.be/T4RXM7TIQ3w">new strains</a> are the new thing everybody needs to be worried about.</p>
<p>If you take everything that is reported at face value, the new strains are a brand new reason for everyone to stay afraid (supposedly they are more contagious, deadlier and target younger populations).</p>
<p>However, like we have seen happen with many of the worst case scenario prediction, doomsday is eventually found to be avoided a month or two later and then the media goes on to focus on a different reason to be afraid.</p>
<p>I can't remember the specifics but much of the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-fast-can-scientists-find-the-new-coronavirus-strains/">technology available</a> since the beginning of the covid was not available at any time before and I have a personal theory based on my own experience in testing complicated systems.  Often when you have a newfound ability to analyze some particular type of data, there is the risk of <a href="https://www.statisticshowto.com/observer-bias/">observer bias</a> that will incorrectly steer the findings towards validating a pre-conceived notion.</p>
<p>In other words, to what degree have flu epidemics and their strains been analyzed like we are now doing with covid?  Were new flu strains also being identified being evaluated as causes of concern preemptively back then too?</p>
<p>When you are worried about the worst case scenarios (as the scientists should be), it is very easy to find what appears to be evidence but it actually is just anomalous behavior that had always been there but was never observed.</p></p>

        <p>I've long thought this.  People automatically believing the 'news', developing an opinion, then herd mentality takes over.  For some reason most people have decided to stop thinking for themselves and allow their opinions to be fed to them instead of formulating their own.  Anybody that doesn't follow the herd is branded as a heretic.</p>

        <p>Yeah, this is a problem but I'm peeling it back a couple layers and just talking about the actual studies being published by scientists and researchers.</p>
<p>Science is constantly changing and it just seems na√Øve to expect that all of this rapidly emerging science is rock solid the first time it is studied in a climate of panic.</p>

        <p>I'm honestly not.  Look at the last 10 years of social media.  Trends develop and die so quickly.  That's why I've kind of ignored the whole thing.  People in this country have the attention span of hyperactive gnats on meth.  Ignore the 'issue' and it will die quickly.  Thing is people on 'our' side keep picking fights with people on 'their' side and they become entrenched.  The country is opening back up slowly but surely and I don't see bodybags piling up anywhere.   Still waiting for the god awful spike from the Rangers game to happen you know where the cases jump by .0000001 percent and it's the end of the world all over again.  I'll just yawn and continue to live my life maskless and un vaccinated.  Thanking whatever higher power there is that I live in the sticks in the middle of nowhere TX.</p>

        <p>I really think so. Without it, people wouldn't have taken the lockdowns as much as they did because there would be much less "You can work from home." And there would be no way schools could be closed so long if those programs to have "class" at home didn't exist. The virtue-signalers couldn't tell you "If you don't want to wear a muzzle, just buy things online and stop being a plague rat!" Places couldn't tell you to text them when you arrive. It would be a lot harder to convince people not to go out because not everything can be done online like it can now. You couldn't film people without face diapers to shame them. </p>
<p>Another thing is that I think that as technology continues to evolve, humanity continues to <em>de</em>volve. Social media and just living your life online creates shallow people who can't think for themselves and who only go along with the majority opinion and never question anything. It's made people bigger wusses and more lazy because they don't have to do anything. I believe that for that reason, we have more snowflakes. It would never be like this in the 50s, or even a few decades ago. Bosses would just say "You're not coming to work because you're scared of a virus? Then you're fired. You want to wear a mask to work because there's a virus? I won't have you scaring people in my business."</p>
<p>As a kid, we joked about how in the future we'd have robots in our homes that would do everything for us and that's basically true now. I think technology is at a point where it really doesn't need to get better because it would just make us worse as people.</p>

        <p>I actually specifically was talking about medical research technology specifically but I realize I didn't make that clear.  You bring up an excellent point though, this would have never been possible without remote working technology.  You can't just shut down society.  Well, turns out people had no problems doing that as long as it was shutting down the part of society as long as it mostly affects people outside your socioeconomic class.</p>

        <p>I think it's also the Kevin Bacon effect. I know someone who knows someone who knows someone who got the new strain and they are (pick the outcome that sounds scariest here.) But they are always six degrees from Kevin Bacon on their actual knowledge of what happened.</p>

        <p>Perhaps that's part of the problem as well but the specific problem I was trying to get at is with the researchers and scientists who are all in a mad dash to get their research covered in the media.</p>
<p>Also, there is an additional layer to the problem as well since what the media reports is often an exaggeration or misinterpretation of the actual study findings because the sensationalist headlines get advertising dollars.</p>

        <p>I have always figured strain mutation would be a problem just like it is with the flu vaccine that often only gets only ~50% effectiveness. 
They are already talking about booster shots for people's 2 doses.  I call it the subscription plan.  I'm just curious how long they will let the first round of vaccines be valid for.</p>

        <p>I'm curious about this too. I saw a bunch of comments about the NYS passport where people were saying theirs popped up as expired or about to expire. The claim has been three months of immunity whether natural or vax acquired. That doesn't account for double mutant strains lol.</p>
