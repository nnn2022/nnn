    <strong>Good news for musicians but still not sustainable</strong>
    <p><p>Here's a nonprofit I support in theory. They're advocating for a bill in early stages in Congress that would provide up to 15 billion to arts venues to keep them afloat. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CIbSqQZJwyb/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet">https://www.instagram.com/tv/CIbSqQZJwyb/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet</a></p>
<p>The downside, however, is that this will only keep the established players in business. Imagine starting a new band now. Plus the way this looks, the club owners and their landlords are going to get the lion's share of the profits, unless they somehow reopen (don't count of Chuck Schumer in video to push for that!).</p>
<p>Maybe the newest artists coming up will get big on TikTok and make their future income off of digital ad revenue and livestreams. It saddens me as an orchestral musician who's currently laid off, but it seems like this is happening already and maybe this is just how it's meant to be.</p>
<p>Bottom line - maybe we just have to let it all burn and wait for the green shoots to grow back in a strange new world.</p>
<p>Musicians are welcome to discuss further at my discord channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=QUFFLUhqazQ5cFU5WXlQdnNtMDRORW5yYXJreTJEOF9Kd3xBQ3Jtc0ttdzhYdGhvUGhqdWU1VDc3M3ZLSkxIMEM3SDA2LXpEN19lQWVKMkRMTF9sMlVlVVBneF9rSWpMMVBBY0tFREdhcUpucTVKVThyT2RlbnVsOFFscFZpc2JpVVpzSUxuNkVrdVdxWFBEMi1SSGFkQi1qSQ%3D%3D&amp;v=KMdTKN3fqNw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2FXMXpayXMUW&amp;event=video_description">https://discord.gg/XMXpayXMUW</a></p></p>

        <p>From one musician to another, the government can not fix this, and I will never take their blood money. I’m engaging in new career prospects right now, that’s the only thing I can do in good faith. I feel like every musician I know is complicit in this charade. Just making their Instagram videos and starting online lessons, like everything’s normal. I don’t shame them, but it personally makes me sick and I want nothing to do with it.</p>
