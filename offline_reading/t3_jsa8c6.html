    <strong>"There is nothing that you can do about this."</strong>
    <p><p>I am constantly being told that.
I hate it.</p>
<p>After freaking out more (the cycle is rapid), i am being told that I need to change my medication, because I'm so worried and anxious over all that's falling apart. It takes over my every thought. </p>
<p>I freak out, I'm furious, I'm confused, I'm trapped. But ultimately I am told "There is nothing that you can do about this. There is nothing anyone can do."</p>
<p>Nothing that anyone can do.</p>
<p>I'm absolutely going crazy sitting home all alone, surrounded with propaganda all over tv, internet, radio, stores, highway signs, knowing of the suicides, job losses, inability to live...</p>
<p>All that is in my head all the time I can't get away from it! But if I had the right medication, I would be able to handle this better...?</p>
<p>I can't do this for 2 more years, or 2 months, or 2 days.</p>
<p>I'm thinking of moving to a non-mask state. I feel like if I'm not surrounded by it all the time, I'd be able to live.</p>
<p>Right now I feel like I'm living,  just to die another day. That's all. Work online, be home, die another day. That all.</p></p>

        <p>This is why I don’t bother with therapy. They can’t fix the problem and it’s only going to make me more depressed if someone tells me I need to accept the situation.</p>

        <p>I'm jealous that you even have the option to move to a better place.
Right now I'm stuck in England and I'm not allowed to leave the country or even the house really. </p>
<p>But fuck that shit. Who the fuck do they think they are, telling me what to do? I'm going out tonight for a long drive to spend the evening with some friends, without masks, hugging each other, zero distancing. The msm and elite wankers can stick their fake pandemic up their ass.</p>

<p>Just remember you are right. You are right to be angry. Let yourself be angry. No, we don't have to get used to this and we never should. Ever. And tell anyone who tells you that to fuck off and never come around with that bullshit again.</p>

        <p>&rt;Right now I feel like I'm living, just to die another day. That's all. Work online, be home, die another day. That all.</p>
<p>I feel you on that. The days dragged on and life was on pause since March. Late October until now were the exceptions. I started going to bars and dance clubs that had just opened in late Oct. Life was returning to some sort of normalcy. I also joined a gym last week after an 8-month hiatus and have been killing it making great progress on the 20% strength loss and rebuilding muscle. I swear, my past three workouts felt orgasmic afterward! I lost 15 lbs during the first 3 weeks of lockdown, which is unprecedented for me. I've regained my appetite and have been bulking up nicely. I also went indoor bouldering with a friend. But last Thursday, our governor (Kate Brown of OR) decided to lock our state down starting this Wednesday for a minimum of 2 weeks. The county I live in will be in lockdown for a min of 4 weeks! So no more gym,  and no more dancing at dance clubs. These are the 2 things that keep me fairly emotionally stable, healthy, social, and excited to be alive. Now it's back to lame Zoom dance events, binge drinking, becoming malnourished, slothfulness, and feeling like I'm merely occupying space and time like a soulless blob. I'm tempted to at take a vacation someplace less restrictive to feel alive again instead of feeling like a flower withering away...</p>
