    <strong>January 31, 2021. The End of Lockdowns. Globally. Forever.</strong>
    <p><p>We've had it. <strong>This needs to end.</strong></p>
<p>We need to take a stand against lockdowns. Not one business, one family, one person, one protest. Everyone. Everywhere. Simultaneously.</p>
<p>We can't let politicians tell us when this ends. <strong><em>We</em></strong> <strong>decide when this ends.</strong></p>
<p>On January 31, 2021, I pledge to begin living my life completely normally in all respects:</p>
<ul>
<li>I will visit my family.</li>
<li>I will go the gym.</li>
<li>I will go out for dinner.</li>
<li>I will leave my house past curfew.</li>
<li>I will travel to exotic and wonderful places.</li>
<li>I will open my business to customers.</li>
<li>I will go to church.</li>
<li>I will see a baseball game.</li>
<li>I will see a concert.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This isn't about masks.</strong> Some people out there are still afraid -- if someone (<em>not</em> the government) asks me nicely to wear a mask around them, I will.</p>
<p><strong>This isn't about vaccines.</strong> If someone wants to take a vaccine, great. I might take one too. It's a personal choice. I hope the vulnerable get the vaccines they need.</p>
<p><strong>This isn't about covid-19 denial.</strong> Almost 2 million people globally have died of or with COVID-19. But <em>59 million</em> people died of other things, and <em>59 million more will die this year.</em> Life must go on.</p>
<p><strong><em>Frequently Asked Questions</em></strong></p>
<p>---------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Why January 31? Why not right now?</strong></p>
<p>We need time to get the message out. By February, we'll be approaching one year of lockdowns. That's more than 1% of a typical person's <em>entire life</em> in lockdown. That's:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>7.8 billion person-years</strong> in lockdown globally</li>
<li><strong>4,161</strong> person-years of lockdown <em>per single COVID death</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why are you forcing people out of lockdown?</strong></p>
<p>No one is forcing anyone to do anything. If you wish to remain in lockdown, you may do so indefinitely.</p>
<p><strong>Are you an anti-vaxxer?</strong></p>
<p>I'm up-to-date on all of my vaccines; thank you for your concern. I will take the COVID vaccine when it's ready.</p>
<p><strong>Why aren't you listening to doctors?</strong></p>
<p>A medical license allows doctors to treat disease, not put billions of healthy people under house arrest.</p>
<p><strong>Why aren't you following the science?</strong></p>
<p>I am following the scientists at Harvard, Oxford, and Stanford who advocate against lockdowns: <a href="https://gbdeclaration.org/">https://gbdeclaration.org/</a>  </p>
<p><strong>Do you want my grandma to die?</strong></p>
<p>Nothing is stopping vulnerable populations from continuing to isolate, at their own discretion.</p>
<p><strong>Don't you care about hospitals being overwhelmed?</strong></p>
<p>We're approaching week 52 of 2 weeks to slow the spread. Those weeks, however you count them, were supposed to be for hospitals to prepare. They've had enough time. Excess hospital capacity built early in the pandemic was disassembled, having gone unused.</p>
<p><strong>We should at least be doing</strong> <strong><em>something</em></strong>, right?</p>
<p>Maybe, if "something" were completely free and without negative consequences. Forced lockdowns are not that. They are going to cause, among other harms:</p>
<ul>
<li>A tsunami of undetected and untreated cancer</li>
<li>A mental health crisis driving a barrage of suicides and drug overdoses</li>
<li>Global poverty and famine the staggering effects of which will be difficult to calculate</li>
<li>Undeserved mass worship of authority, paving the way for dictators of all sorts</li>
<li>Delays in the development of vaccines, treatments, and cures for every other human ailment </li>
</ul>
<p>January 31, 2021. Life begins again.</p></p>
