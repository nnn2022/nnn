    <strong>What info/proof would be enough for you?</strong>
    <p><p>Question for those of you who don't think covid is a big deal -
do you believe that a pandemic of this supposed magnitude is a real possibility?</p>
<p>If so, what evidence would it take for you to believe that it was actually happening?</p>
<p>E.g. family member dying, you yourself getting sick, actually seeing it all around you, a politician you trust saying it was real, a trustworthy friend saying it was real, doing an actual scientific study yourself, etc.</p></p>

        <p>Simple, I’d actually be scared. I was really nervous at first but the more inconsistencies and inane security theatre that pervaded, the less I was worried. </p>
<p>It’s telling that in my country’s most recent lockdown, the government ran an ad campaign essentially telling us that we need to be more scared of it. What kind of deadly existential threat, viral or otherwise, needs it’s own PR campaign and fan club?</p>
