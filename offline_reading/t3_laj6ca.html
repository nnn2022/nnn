    <strong>My anxiety has turned crippling</strong>
    <p><p>Tomorrow morning I’m going to the car dealer for an oil change. As (un)usual, masks &amp; social distancing “required.” These lockdowns have filled me with anxiety to the point where I look for every excuse in the book to avoid going into an indoor public place. My mom yells at me every day for this, like, “please go get it! You do nothing all day!” It’s not COVID I’m anxious about, it’s how totalitarian my society has become regarding masks. I go inside any place maskless, I can expect violent confrontations, bullying, &amp; abuse. And I’ll probably be brutalized by police &amp; flogged while civilians cheer me on.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, &amp; because of flight rules in Canada (no travel to the Caribbean/Mexico), I can’t escape to anywhere free. Money? Impossible to make; literally impossible to find a job. And even if I did find a job, because I’m a straight white male who does not openly &amp; loudly agree with every tenet of leftist philosophy, everybody already considers me a far-right extreme racist, sexist, misogynist, &amp; a rapist by default. I have a target on my back 24/7, &amp; I feel like a piece of meat surrounded by 8 billion hungry, angry piranhas. Friends/girls? No one is open to meeting anyone new; it’s all about who you know, &amp; I don’t know anyone. I feel like my only escape from my situation is through death/suicide. I tried to kill myself a week ago. I’m so overwhelmed by anxiety about tyrannical, evil drones of the elite agenda that I can’t even leave my own neighbourhood. Doing anything feels like a huge struggle/chore. I’ve been struggling to get out of bed for the last few days. I would feel a little better if I wasn’t so burnt out &amp; overwhelmed that I can’t lie anymore.</p>
<p>My mom yells at me all the time for not trying to participate in this fucked up system, but I don’t want to participate in a system that oppresses me &amp; forces me to suppress my true self basically every waking hour &amp; works me to death just to be homeless. Everybody talks about life being beautiful &amp; good, but all I see, now &amp; going forward, is misery, suffering, &amp; struggle. I don’t know how much more I can take.</p>
<p>I know you guys tell me to be strong &amp; I appreciate that, but for the first time in my life, I feel truly broken. I think watching my dad, who I used to deem a beacon of rationality, free thinking, acceptance, &amp; love, demand I mask up while walking alone outside combined with the travel bans &amp; “stay at home orders” JUST as I was starting to venture outside of my neighbourhood &amp; start meeting new people on a daily basis did it.</p>
<p>Congratulations Doug Ford, Justin Trudeau, Theresa Tam, the WEF, the CCP &amp; the entire elite cabal behind this. You did it. You broke me. Well played.</p></p>

        <p>I hear ya, and I know it’s damn hard to get motivated when you’re depressed. But start with small stuff, make your bed clean up a little. Do anything that you can claim as getting something done for the day that’ll help. Gotta start small so you don’t get overwhelmed. And talk to someone, a professional if that’s what you need.</p>

        <p>All told, I think it’s just the realization that it’s been a year. COVID first became a thing in my house at the end of January 2020, when my parents told me “you can’t go to the gym.” So everybody talks about shut downs beginning in March, but really, I just crossed the 1-year threshold of dealing with this bullshit.</p>
<p>And honestly, it’s hitting my mind: “FUCK. IT’S BEEN A YEAR.”</p>

        <p>I wholeheartedly agree with this. Your brain runs off "DPOs"—Duration Path Outcomes. I'm having a hard time, as well, as we all are, I'm sure. But just by knowing that this is a biological issue, and by being able to understand it, it can help you to approach it creatively. </p>
<p>Right now, in the world, we don't know the duration of this insanity. We're unsure of the path. Will the outcome create a world that disgusts us, that makes us feel crazy watching everyone's behavior? That continues to limit our liberty?</p>
<p>Create your own DPOs. To work out, I do a deck of cards. Shuffle the deck, then go through it, alternating push-ups, sit-ups, squats, pull-ups; designate different face cards with different activities. </p>
<p>You're not crazy.</p>

        <p>That almost sounds exactly like me. I live in America so our travel restrictions aren't as bad. I do still have a job but I'm forced to play along with the covid theater the whole time. Because of my religion I would never commit suicide but I may not survive this much longer anyways. My depression is making it so hard to even force myself to eat that most days I only eat one small meal a day. You need to find ways to rebel against the authoritarians, no matter how small it is rebel. Even just letting my nose poke out makes me feel empowered. I get feeling scared about being attacked for it, that's why I keep a taser and a knife on me at all times. Than if even just having your nose poke out is to big of a step you can wear a nasal cannula and have the tube go into a backpack to make it look like you have a medical exemption. If Canada has medical confidentiality laws than stores and what not wont even be allowed to ask you about it.</p>

        <p>I used to rebel. Now I feel too anxious to even do that. I know there’s a medical exemption rule in Canada &amp; they can’t ask you, but I’m still obsessively thinking about what would happen if I walked in maskless.</p>
<p>Fantasies of dealership employees yelling at me &amp; chanting “SHAME” in my face, even as I tell them I’m medically exempt (given what I’ve been going through since this shit started I might as well be) are dancing in my head.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I get it. I'm scared most of the time. Just tonight at work I saw so many people double layering masks. Just made me sick. I thought at least some of them were just playing along to stay out of trouble but no, they actually believe this nonsense enough to wear two masks. I feel mose alone than ever before. Good luck. I'm not sure if i have enough hope left to encourage anyone else anymore.</p>

        <p>God damn man just wear a mask. What is the worse that could happen to you? I agree with the premise of this sub, but some of you are literally going batshit crazy over a mask, calm down, all these rants are giving me the impression that some of you are mentally ill. Folks are arguing with their families etc. You won't achieve anything by doing that. It's your right to not wear a mask in public but not when entering a business, at that point, it's their discretion. Don't make a scene!</p>
