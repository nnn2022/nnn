    <strong>Any EU resident or knowledgeable person, need your help</strong>
    <p><p>I have a trip planned to Italy in September and just saw that if i don't download and use the Green Pass, even if i test negative prior, i would still have to self isolate/quarantine for 10 days upon arrival and am required to test again after that's up. But if i have the green pass and test negative, no isolation is necessary.</p>
<p>Without getting into how obviously ridiculous that is, has anyone recent traveled to the EU where they experienced this? I also saw that this requirement is in place until 30th of July, is that true? If so, i should be fine in September. Haven't seen my boyfriend in over a year and since he can't come to US I'm going to him</p></p>

        <p>Usually, when they say something is in place until a specified date, that means they'll have a meeting to decide whether to extend it shortly before that date.</p>
<p>Our 2-3 week lockdown starting at the end of November was extended up until may that way and we still have mask-mandates for shopping.</p>
<p>So you can't really do anything but to hope it's actually true this time and check again when that date is reached.</p>

        <p>where are you going to in italy? my cousin was in lignano and venice a few weeks ago. he had to show a negative test or vax card when crossing the border but nothing else while he was in italy. restaurants don't require masks or anything. hotel didn't ask for anything too. afaik it is different in some regions in italy but those two seem to be very normal.</p>
<p>of course it can change until september but for now if you have a negative test or a vax card you should be good to go and won't go in isolation.  i have to try it myself in august but i believe what he said.</p>
