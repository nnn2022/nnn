    <strong>sad and depressed...</strong>
    <p><p>I discovered my passion for traveling when I took my first trip ever to Paris in late 2018. Nothing made me feel more alive than traveling for the very first time. It was a wonderful trip that I decided this is what I wanted to do with my life....nothing else. Fast forward to now and it looks like my dream of going back to Europe is dead cause I'm never EVER taking this experimental jab....even if it costs me my ultimate dream. I'm 24 and still believe that it is my destiny to return to Europe someday....but I'm feeling quite hopeless right now. Time is running out and unless a miracle happens and the house of cards comes tumbling down......my life will be rendered useless. Nothing matters</p></p>

        <p>You’re not alone, there are lots of us out here that feel the same… they’re coming nowhere near me either with that poison… we all need to resist and make sure that they know that there are enough of us that haven’t fallen for their lies! Keep strong better days are coming, I know it.</p>

        <p>I know how you feel, and I’ve been processing this loss of freedom since March 2020 when I saw the writing on the wall. Truth be told I started traveling extensively in 2017 because I knew there wouldn’t be that much time left to explore the world in that way. Call it a gut feeling, or spending too much time on r/con. Anyway, the opportunity in this moment is to look inside and find the magic of being a human. None of us need to physically travel somewhere to feel the deep love we have inside of ourselves. This is a spiritual awakening for humanity, should you choose to accept. It sucks to think of not traveling, but there are far more important things in jeopardy right now— for instance the lives of everyone we love. This is a war for human freedom, we are all being called upon to face the future with courage. Unflinchingly! As max Igan would say. Okay, rant over. I feel you. It’s fucking terrible what’s happening. But we must fight with all we’ve got.</p>

        <p>OP, I feel your pain. I love traveling! I have been to Puerto Rico, Viet Nam, Japan, Hong Kong and Canada; these countries are all beautiful. My ultimate goal was to visit Ireland and sad to say, this won't be happening because of this scam. Now come to find out, they mandating nonsense over there as well and it is as if they want their citizenry under permanent martial law. I love the Irish culture, its history and its people, but unfortunately, that old Irish grit that has been wiped away because of this alleged "virus."</p>
<p>Yes, this is depressing, and it sounds like there is no hope; I agree with you. However, as long as there at least one person on that island resisting this, it gives me hope. I think in time this will resolve itself and the question is when will it resolve itself?</p>

        <p>My unvaccinated ass just got back from a trip to Turkey. Had to test to get there and get back to the US but had a great time in between. Lots of people wore masks outside and the hotel staff had to but almost no one made us except for a few indoor places, so we just left. There are a lot of outdoor things to do, Greek ruins, beautiful beaches, delicious food and lots of history if you’re into it. I kind of resigned myself to that being my last overseas trip for a while. Really kind people as well and happy to have tourists.</p>

        <p>Don’t lose hope. We don’t really know how this is going to pan out in the long term. Hopefully the storm will eventually pass and we can get back to travelling.</p>
<p>I’m from Australia, where our borders have been closed since March 2020. It isn’t looking likely that they’ll reopen until at least next year. This has been very disheartening for me, as an avid traveller like yourself, but I try to hold on to hope.</p>
<p>Maybe you could try doing some local travel for now- camping/glamping and reconnecting with nature.</p>
<p>Focus on other things and stack the money away, so that when you’re finally able to travel, you’ll have tons of savings- even if it’s in like 10 years.</p>
<p>Hang in there!</p>

        <p>Don't worry, they'll eventually let people travel without  the vaccine. You just gotta hunker down for a few years, travel around your own country and wait it out for now. You got this!!!</p>

        <p>Yeah I feel you. This is one of the worst times to be alive in history. Not that I'm saying we have it worse than many historical peoples, but never before has freedom been so attainable, and dangled in front of us (by our parents and grandparents generations) and destroyed. It is enough to make you want to burn it all down. The world is becoming neo-fascist (basically anyone who believes in medical apartheid based on vaccination status is the literal definition of a fascist), not only is the great reset, it is the great de-enlightenment of the masses. They are reverting to blind fanaticism and dogmatic belief in what they are told by 'scientific' authorities. It's depressing as fuck but also... maybe could be an opportunity once the dominos start to fall (one would hope).</p>

        <p>I’m facing the possibility of never going back to my favorite place in the world, the place where literally all my best times and memories have been over the past 10 years, and it kills me. I can’t even watch movies or read a book anymore because everything just feels so absolutely pointless. It’s like just waiting to die, fucking sucks man. So not Europe, different place but I know how bad it feels. All I do is go to work and sit on my couch waiting to go to bed anymore</p>
