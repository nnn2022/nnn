    <strong>Can you guys give me solid info against the vaccines? I entirely reject the vax and all my friends want to know why.</strong>
    <p><p>It’d be really nice to have information and sources on tab rather than having to scavenge the internet for it whenever they ask me and then result with no information because it’s all censored. I see a ton of stuff here and if you guys could drop some articles and studies and whatnot, that’d be sooo appreciated!!</p></p>

        <ol>
<li>
<p>mRNA vaccines have been in development for years now and have failed at animal trails every time.  Why? Because ALL of the animals died.  All of them.  They didn’t die immediately, they died over the course of 6 months from things like Paralyisis, Blood clots, heart attacks, seizures etc.  They conveniently skipped animal trails this time because “emergency protocols”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All vaccine companies have complete 100% liability protection from any lawsuits no matter what happens to you.  As such, life insurance policies are also voided if you die from any of these vaccines as they are experimental and what we are witnessing IS the human trails which end in 2024.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Astra-Zeneca among other vaccines have been largely funded by well known eugenicists like Bill Gates, who talks openly about his depopulation agenda and whose father was a huge eugenicist and in favour of reducing the population of earth to an easily controllable slave race of 500 million (see the Georgia Guidestones, New World Order, Great Reset etc.) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you ignore all of this and go purely on what the media and vaccine companies say, the vaccine doesn’t protect you from getting Covid, it doesn’t protect you from transmitting Covid, it doesn’t let you take your mask off, it doesn’t let you stop social distancing, it doesn’t let you go to concerts or have any restaurants opening up, it literally is just suppose to make symptoms less bad for a virus that already has a 99.9% survival rate, so what the fuck are you taking it for?? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The article has been since taken down, but as of March 19th in the UK there had been some 44,000+ adverse reactions to the Covid vaccines REPORTED to the vaccine injury reporting system.  These included but we’re not limited to, paralysis, deaths, strokes, seizures, skin peeling off, Aids or aids like symptoms, extreme re-infections of Covid that resulted in hospitalisations or death, and a few cases of people literally dying from bleeding out of their eyes.  I shit you not.  And the kicker? They expect that less than 1% of actual adverse reactions are reported to this system.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If any of this isn’t enough for your friends, send them to r/Covidvaccinated where people proudly flaunt how their parents died from the vaxx but still push people to get it because “my dead mom was a huge believer in vaccines and she wouldn’t want her death from one to put people off of getting it” </p>
<p>Absolute complete and total psychosis and insanity</p>

        <p>Here's my reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Me and my closest family are healthy and don't need it.</li>
<li>Parents already got vaccinated or had covid.</li>
<li>I'm guessing that one of the five times I had cold or flu like symptoms over the last year was covid, so I'm good.</li>
<li>I owe those who kept us locked up under house arrest for a year nothing.</li>
<li>The vaccine passport propaganda is good enough reason to resist it outright.</li>

        <p>I was offered it very early and many times. I said I thought it was too early for me to get it and many at risk people could use it before I should. Now that theyre open to everybody I guess you could spin it that many 3rd world countries are still lacking and theres plenty of at risk people there that could use it.
