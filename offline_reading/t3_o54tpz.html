    <p><p>&rt;ADVICE NEEDED: How to convince my friend to get the vaccine, are very anti vaxx due to the "long term effects" it might have</p>
<p>&rt;I am trying to seek advice on how to convince my friend to get the vaccine, she is extremely anti vaccination because she says that they do not know "long term effects" the vaccine might have. I feel quite hopeless as I am not a doctor and have not done much research into this, however I have tried to tell her that it is far better than the alternative which is being in the middle of an epidemic like there is in India at the moment. Any advice, articles or help you could give would be GREATLY appreciated.</p>
<p>Love how they put long term effects in air quotes.  Also like how they cite their own lack of research into the topic, it adds that layer of credibility that you like to see in a person.</p></p>
