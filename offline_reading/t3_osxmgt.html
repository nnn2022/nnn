    <strong>I’ve had it.</strong>
    <p><p>I’m going to state this first: I’m not anti-vax. I believe in body autonomy though. The right for a person to govern what happens to their body without external influence or coercion.</p>
<p>If someone wants the vaccine, fine. If someone doesn’t, in my opinion that should also fine. </p>
<p>I’m tired of absolutism when it comes to getting vaccinated and I’m even more tired of unvaccinated people being vilianized.</p>
<p>I have an autoimmune disorder and this is what it says on the cdc.gov website:</p>
<p>“People with autoimmune conditions may receive a COVID-19 vaccine. However, they should be aware that no data are currently available on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines for people with autoimmune conditions.”</p>
<p>Why on earth would I want to inject something into my body when there is no data on the safety of the substance?! If you think about this in any other situation, people would say the concern is reasonable.</p></p>

        <p>I honestly wonder if they’d have higher rates of vaccination if they’d stop shoving it down everyone’s throat. </p>
<p>I know people who are on the fence that are seriously sketched out by how aggressive the government and media are being. They read headlines like “There are now two America’s: The Vaccinated and Unvaccinated” and see people like “NBA legend” Charles Barkley say “The only people who are not vaccinated are just a-holes” and all of his fans cheer him on for saying that. </p>
<p>They want higher vaccination rates? Stop calling people who haven’t gotten the vaccine a-holes and plastering that message all over the media. </p>
<p>If they put out the vaccines and said: “There it is. Have it if you want.” I honestly would be slightly less put off by the idea. Now I just hate the mainstream media and our government even more for dividing people on the topic of medicine and medical practices.</p>

        <p>The other nonsense they try to come up with is that I'm "anti-vax".  Lately I reply with "I'm pro-vax because I'm pro-vaccine safety protocols. If anything, you're anti-vax for doing great harm to the integrity of vaccines by encouraging the use of unapproved vaccines that do not have long-term safety data.  Newer vaccines (nothing to do with Covid) will suffer reputational damage based on your ignorance of how vaccine safety protocols have worked throughout the entire history of vaccines, up until this year.</p>

        <p>I’ve read so many people saying “well they’re just choosing to die then” when talking about people who won’t get the vaccine. My very first reason for not getting the vaccine was because I already had covid. Still very much alive. Now since everything is so fucking whack I have a long list of reasons why I won’t get vaccinated. Strange times we are living in that’s for sure.</p>

        <p>Oh yeah, I get you.  This has been a game of "what's the ulterior motive?" all along.  Useful idiots don't know this. They think once everybody's vaccinated, we magically get on with our lives....all they have to do is get that last 10% to 15% of the population vaccinated...and magically everything is OK again.  Of course, there's ulterior motives at play.  I'm just playing a straight bat back to them.  Call me an asshole, wish me dead...it's making me even more averse to taking these "vaccines".</p>

        <p>I think they’re going to continue pushing the shame and blame game… But why? </p>
<p>Honestly, I feel like they have nothing to work with. They have vaccines made by pharma giants that aren’t the miracle they made them out to be. The virus is still transmissible, you can technically still get sick with covid, you can even be fully vaccinated and still die from covid. Plus, people are having adverse reactions to the vaccines every single day.</p>
<p>I think their product (the vaccine) is over-hyped and severely lacks necessary safety data.</p>

        <p>It’s like someone begging you for a date. Even if you might have been interested in the person, the level of desperation makes it seem unattractive.</p>
<p>I can’t help but think those leading the vaccination campaigns are left-leaning, because they rely on groupthink consensus (getting celebrities and influencers onboard), bribery (free donuts), and insulting those who are “hesitant” as “Trumpers” (note that Trump himself is vaccinated and hesitancy is high among racial minorities). They need to rethink their playbook.</p>

        <p>Haha someone begging for a date is a good analogy. </p>
<p>I think they’d possibly have more luck if they didn’t push their agenda so aggressively. I also think they need to be transparent if they’re going to win certain people’s trust and be willing to show the good, the bad, and the ugly and then let people make up their own minds. I guess that wouldn’t be a good strategy for them when profits are involved though.</p>
<p>Also the censorship is super weird and sketchy. I was part of two private Facebook groups that were not anti-vax. They were groups for people to talk about their experiences receiving the vaccines. The groups were both shut down. Private groups with thousands of members where people are just talking about their experiences: Gone.</p>

        <p>Clearly there’s a concerted effort to present the CCP Virus as a fair bit more deadly than it is, in fact. </p>
<p>The point is the sewing of division, this country is being subverted and will only begin to heal when the cancers of Western Society at large have been purged. In a way I’m fine with the dissolution, perhaps it will become destabilized enough to affect some real change.</p>

        <p>IMAO it's better to make oneself an inhospitable host as possible before an infection.  Support the immune system and keep it well regulated and alert.  Add in things known to abend viral replication (cough Zn+ionophores cough) and just remember, an infection with SARS-CoV-2 is not an auto-death sentence.

        <p>I used to work at Walgreens and they pushed flu shots so hard. They’d have district-wide store competitions and whichever store beat their flu shot record from the previous year would win iPads for their employees. </p>
<p>The managers would also be on the employees all the time about who hadn’t gotten their flu shot yet. We’d all take turns making announcements over the loud speaker about going to the pharmacy to get your shot. </p>
<p>We had to ask every customer at the register if they’d gotten their shot yet.</p>
<p>Ugh it creeped me out then and still creeps me out now.</p>
<p>Don’t believe anyone who says vaccines aren’t a very profitable industry. Flu shots were a 1.6 billion dollar industry back in 2015. <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2015/10/19/the-16-billion-business-of-flu.html">Source</a></p>

And even if that wasn’t case- since when do they give a fuck about people? I’ve found that you’ve got to be your own advocate in the healthcare system, or you just get pilled on with shit you didn’t ask for and end up in debt by the time they (maybe) help/figure out what is wrong with you.</p>

        <p>The standard clown answer is 'oh well if you are medically exempt then you can be exempted from the vax pass requirement'. But hang on a minute. The virus doesn't care about the difference between CAN'T be jabbed and WON'T be jabbed. Allowing that distinction proves that it is actually about punishing different beliefs rather than public health.</p>

        <p>Lots of things going against the insurance of the vaccine. Been that way since the beginning- yet people praise this emergency vaccine for “softening the curb”. Of course it works! The only reason why delta is an issue is cause of the unvaxxed, right? Yet you can still contract/spread Covid 19 while being vaxxed. Seriously- people are so scared of dying they will take anything that tells them they won’t.</p>

        <p>Yeah, one of the biggest reasons I am here is the coercion and hate. FWIW I am jabbed myself but if someone else doesn't want the jab then 'no thanks' should be THE END OF THE MATTER. No jab no job policies and a discriminatory 2 tier segregated society are FUCKING TERRIBLE outcomes and anyone who has been terrified into supporting this evil nonsense has become deranged through fear and psyops.

        <p>Same here, not anti Vax but this vaccine was very quick and convenient, side effects are only starting to show and that's only so far, god know what will happen down the line in a few years. No vaccine like this has been blind trialed without impunity like this.</p>

        <p>Exactly. We’re finding out the side-effects in real time. Cases of myocarditis, blood clots, and Guillain-Barré syndrome. No idea why no one seems to care about the individuals suffering from those disease (or those who have unfortunately passed as a result of an adverse reaction to the vaccine). It’s like one person’s life seems to matter more than another’s.</p>

        <p>I don’t think you should need to clarify you aren’t anti-vaxx, my friend. I also have an autoimmune that causes a ton of inflammation internally and externally. I don’t want to get something that might cause more inflammation inside of me. But I agree, people should just choose what makes them feel comfortable and then mind their own busienss</p>

        <p>Yeah I guess I’m becoming conditioned now to say I’m not anti-vax out of fear that people will whip out the pitch forks if I mention I’m not vaccinated. </p>
<p>People are downright mean to others that are unvaccinated when they don’t even know their side, which is incredibly sad.</p>
<p>Charles Barkley made headlines today for saying “The only people who are not vaccinated are just a-holes.” That one quote was covered by CNBC, Fox News, Yahoo!, and many more… What kind of a screwed up message is the media sending to the masses when people are labeled as a-holes for not getting a vaccine that’s still being used for emergency use only!! How is that acceptable?! My mind is blown over how ridiculous this is.</p>

        <p>Then you shouldn’t get the vaccine my dude B)</p>
<p>If you feel pressured: don’t.</p>
<p>If you have an auto immune disease, then it’s precisely becuase of people like you that everyone needs to get vaccinated.</p>
