    <strong>No New World Order??</strong>
    <p><p>Does it not sit right with ANYONE: that theres a sort of wave of unanimous approval; for the governments conclusions about masks, and vaccines? Like in a “perfect” version of communism: the zeitgeist of blue collar “workers” would be so tired/ exhausted/ disorganized: that they would come to entirely embracing the will of “big brother?” So wholeheartedly; that they would blindly follow his impositions (without question) . So much so: that they would start to causally self govern. They would absorb propagandized info from the “source” and enact it into this unassailable, and universal, “policy.” The “people” (at large) would anthropomorphize the message, and would evlove into the mouthpiece for the governments’ word (and memorandum), We would inundate, and perpetuate a moratorium organically, by turning our focus inwards: and would eventually start “self policing” our fellow brethren. (“Two legs good: Four legs bad” ring any bells??) </p>
<p>When cornered: humans have this ugly propensity to blame, and judge. To demean, and tattle out of fear - before actually applying individual discourse, and skepticism (or even any form of analytical discourse) . People innately yearn for, and crave; “atta boys”... we want to be reassured that were indeed “doing a good job” (or at very least: “the right thing”). We want that validation SO bad, that we’ll even develop our own  personalized justifications (inside of our own heads) to force things to “make sense.” So we feel as if we are congruent with popular opinion.</p>
<p>Practice “social distancing”. “Stay home. Save lives” “Mask up, save lives” and the universal PUSH towards 100% vaccination. The universal narrative that: “There is an ominous force out there. It solely consists of a terribly maligned, and nefarious design. Its a completely novel threat, but absolute: in its virulence. Its this unnamed, unregulated “enemy,” thats absolutely terminal. A “faceless” stranger, that is (potentially) hiding around EVERY single left turn you make. The full scope of your “waking moments” are potentially filled with this ever-impending threat. Its aim is absolute, and inescapable. And it (most likely) lives inside of EVERY SINGLE PERSON YOU COME IN CONTACT WITH!” 
“Better be safe.... better be cautious!! better try and anesthetize yourself as much as humanly possible, and stay the fuck away from EVERYONE!”
But!!!
by effectively doing so: youre facilitating “solidarity”... youre all “in this together,” just: (six feet apart).</p>
<p>I realize that this idea is entirely too polarizing to be able to question its validity, because: people are scared. Everyone has a grandma, and a loved one with some version of a compromised immune system. Everyone has something (or someone) that they cant imagine losing.
And i personally am not a virologist, or a biological physicist... im not studying stem cells, or a member of mensa. Im not a doctor, or even a person that would consider himself, of: “above average intelligence”</p>
<p>But just looking at that message (as objectively as is: “subjectively possible”). Stepping away from what the news says. And that i know the name Fauci: and that its’ supposed to mean something. Trying to quiet the numerous examples ive seen, played out in the countless movies ive watched; on virus’s, and plagues, and zombies, and infection... trying to silence all of the reading ive done on brainwash, and mind control. Conspiracies about the “masons”, or the “illuminati”. Examples of “run of the mill,” mob mentality, and the “hive mind”. Trying to quell my innate nature of “questioning” authority. To try and go as 3rd person, unbiased, objective view, from the outside in: as entirely possible. In an attempt to “zoom” ALL THE WAY OUT.
Looking at those isolated statements (from an authoritarian impetus (for “suggested” guidelines): broadcasted loudly, and repeatedly on the “world stage”)</p>
<p>“Stay home. Keep away from each other. And adorn yourself with as much of a barrier as you can possibly wear: against your fellow human:” seems very suspiciously; like the “kid gloves” version of “mind control.”
(AND IT WAS SO!!) 
How the message thats being sent out: divides us, and promises security IN that very division. How the message is (without saying it outright) love one another. Take care of each other. Ban together for this righteous cause. (But for fucks sake: watch your ass!! Cause Jim could have IT!! I know Jim’s a good guy... and hes always been a great neighbor... but FUCK JIM!! You gonna put your ENTIRE family at risk for fucking JIM????? Because its either YOU: or HIM... do you even KNOW how much Jim ACTUALLY washes his hands??? Can you say for SURE if Jim would do the right thing, if it came right down to it??? Would Jim take care of YOU: if you came down with a cough??? Why should you put your LIFE on the LINE to care about fucking JIM??? He wouldnt!! And neither should you!!!! Eye for an eye JIM!!! .... FUCKER!!!!....)..... “man... i KNEW i always hated Jim” (self righteous cunt!!)</p>
<p>Now i know that theres article upon article: lauding the effectiveness of wearing a mask. As well as theres an equal number of contrarian viewpoints. Ive seen very convincing points/discussions/explanations  on either side. Ive tried as hard as possible to reallllllly, actually be open minded about this ENTIRE thing: as logically as i possibly can muster. 
Im not an anti vaxxer (and really think that the perspective that makes the MOST sense: is that the government(s) have SO much on their fucking plates: that they just dont simply have the time: to orchestrate this “master plan” of seeding our drinking water with fentanyl..). To pacify our nature to rebel.. (And i guess i just hope thats the truth!!). </p>
<p>But i guess the thing that just doesnt “sit right” with me: is the discourse that i posited to myself (inside of my own head) in response to this overwhelming feeling of unease.
I asked myself:
“When was the last time the GOVERNMENT: did something that you saw/ experienced; that was super “intrinsically rewarding” and noble. When was the last time the government did something for you?? Something that was SO awesome: that you had the thought; “maaaan... the government really cares!!! Theyre really actually concerned about MY well being!!” The last time the government told you something: where it really made YOU feel: like theyve got shit “under control”... that you can sleep easy: cause big bro has your fuckin back?? When was the last time that YOU looked at all those white haired, crooked descendants of money, and power, and slavery, and privilege, and thought: “man... mitch mcconnel has my “best interests” in mind!! I TRUST that hes gonna make the RIGHT decision!!!”</p>
<p>But because the stakes are so high, and the consequences so severe: the presence of this virus so novel, and the outcome so unsure: people are just desperately falling in line with “the word” as its broadcast. Uniformly, and on repeat. </p>
<p>The same gov that elected a big orange reality television personality to the “leader of the free world” position... (because he had a clever slogan: “Youre Fired!” - OBVIOUSLY he was the change we needed to “fix” America) 
wherein his first couple days: fired the lead virologist that provides counsel to “the house”, and the emissary that goes between the cdc, and the “office of the pres” (in the event that a worldwide “outbreak” occurs): and just left both positions vacant... the same cdc that had done countless clinical trials (blind, and double blind laboratory “controlled” and “uncontrolled” studies) on the efficacy of a facemask... that concluded in black and white (on their own website: in the “how to make your own face mask” section) concluded with: “there is no conclusive evidence to support that wearing a face mask in a controlled, or uncontrolled environment will prevent the transmission of airborne viral aggregates...” etc. how they “flip flopped” 4!!! Different times on what their best advice was regarding mask usage... in the same wake of destruction of the president using his “presidential veto power” (more times BY FAR than ALL of the other presidents COMBINED) to systematically cater the law: to support his own opinion (or at the very least: eliminate conflicting opposition).</p>
<p>I guess thats what scares me most... is that in the first couple weeks of this business: i saw a shift. People were home from work. They were (obviously) frightened, and unsure. Because whats so unique about this virus is: no matter if youre 5 years old, or age 87: this is the FIRST time that something QUITE like this has ever happened to us.... so that: NO ONE really knows quite how to “handle it”. 
But when they very first decided to shut this WHOLE mother down. People were frightened, and unsure. People all of the sudden had all of this time. All of the sudden didnt NEED to be anywhere, or keep to a schedule. All of the sudden: were just allowed to stop. And breathe. And think. And Just BE...
I was in Salt Lake.
And i saw people going outside.. playing with their families... saw people riding bikes (in small groups) saw people being active, and friendly. People being kind, and enveloping. Inclusive, and inviting. People (in my experience) in the face of a worldwide crisis: defaulted to purely “human”... to automatically employing “humanity” (almost as if it were a “coping mechanism”).... the gov decided to open all of the “parks” and wave entry fees: so folks could go outside. And it was absolutely, and unabashedly beautiful: how for that “moment in time” we all banded together in a way, and faced the uncertainty: with solidarity, and humanity.... i saw (what seemed like) an entire family: decided to come quarantine together: and i saw them walking down the middle of an emtpy street, outside: a line of ten people (aged 5, up to 65) all linked, hand in hand... just going on a family walk (like i was watching the actual brady bunch: in between “takes”)</p>
<p>And what fucks me up, is:
It only really took 2 weeks until we went back to fighting, and arguing. Yelling in traffic, and speeding around residential neighborhoods (even tho there wasnt really anywhere to go) only two weeks before people went back to choosing sides, and biting each others heads off... 2 weeks until it was decided that listening to the government was the “right thing” to do... that if we sat down when we were told, and stood up when we were aloud: that the government would somehow “fix” all this stuff for us: so we could go right back to sucking the “american dreams” big ole cock... 9-5, monday through fri, so we can “earn” that weekend (where we get so “fucked up” that we dont have to think about the “trap” they have us in)... dont have to face the fact that our entire lives are controlled, and regulated... and we say “thank you sir, may i have another” because its just what you do.... what EVERYONE does... 
that it only took 2 weeks (that as long as you and i live: it will never be QUITE like that again: with the entire world on “pause”) to run out of things to do.... 2 weeks to use up the entirety of our humanity. 2 weeks until we started yearning for the familiarity of the “trap.” For the comforts of confine... the safety: of predictability...for the 10,000 page Manual that tells us “what to do.” How to act. What to think. How to feel. How to be.  (That) Gives us the “infinite” option: to “choose” a completely “unique” template (and all of the traits and pre selected mannerisms that go with it)
The illusion of choice, and free will... (by giving us so many “options”... that it no longer FEELS like “multiple choice,” but that we were “gifted” a personalized “free write” essay question (with no “wrong answer”)
And its “working” SO well: that 2 weeks is all we could “handle:” being totally left to our own devices. Left with no guidance, but our own humanness, and causal recompense... our own personal accountability. Our own TRUE selves.
2 weeks
And now: its mask up or fuck you
Tinder bios starting with acronyms as a substitute for personality
ACAB or fuck you
LGBTQ rights or FUCK you
BLM or FUCK YOU
Im poly (but ethically) pansexual (because i dont like categories) sex positive because im not judgemental, and gender fluid (because im afraid to offend ANYONE: by BEING something different)... were now LEFT or RIGHT: and that predicates an entire “persona” thats supposed to substitute for your entire “value structure”: and were so adamant about “social justice” without actually having to be either: “social”, or “virtuous”... without actually having to “sacrifice” for our beliefs... we dont have to have “skin in the game” anymore: because everyone else (skin included) is a potential “carrier”</p>
<p>The truth is: (i fear)
“We have bigger homes, but smaller families. More conveniences, but less time.
We have more degrees, but less “sense:” more knowledge, but less judgement. More experts, but more problems.
More medicines: but less healthiness..
Weve been all the way to the moon and back: but have trouble crossing the street to meet the new neighbors.
Weve built more computers to hold more information, to produce more copies than ever, but have less communication.
We have become long on quantity, but short on quality.
These are times of “fast food” but slow digestion: tall man, but short on character.
Steep profits, but shallow relationships.
Its a time when there is much in the window, but nothing in the room....” (- The XIV Dalai Lama)</p>
<p>And im terrified that (whoever “THEY” are: that “they” are winning.... if not that “they”: have already won)</p></p>
