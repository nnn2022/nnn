    <strong>"This won't end until everyone is masked up."</strong>
    <p><p>Means this will never end. "The mandatory 25 mph speed limit will end when you selfish pricks stop driving 30 like you were before." It's not a big deal but they freak the fuck out like you are driving 100 through a school zone while drunk texting. Cry bullies. This whole thing is like a big "hold your breath the longest" contest. It could end if everyone just agreed to not hold their breath anymore, but the ones who are secretly having fun have to shame and gaslight everyone into believing that the reason they can't breathe is because not enough people are holding their breath.</p>

<p>Who else has heard "the reason our shitty long term plan failed is because the Kulaks messed it up, they should be punished too" before?</p></p>

        <p>This will most likely not end, only worsen, unless massive amounts of people stand up against it on all fronts.</p>
<p>This isn't simply a democrat agenda to thwart Trump, although they are promoting this. This is in fact part of the globalist agenda 2030. It's the beginnings of communism on our land and around the world.</p>
<p>What you're seeing now is a massive psyop to create a compliant slave populous that will not only persecute people not obeying the system, but eventually in the not too distant future will turn in dissenters to be shipped to encampments and eventually executed.</p>
<p>The mask is nothing more than the symbol used to gauge how soon they can move forward with the next steps toward a future where freedom is non existent and everyone is owned by their technocratic overlords.</p>

        <p>Pretty much nailed it although I would argue it isn't really about communism. It goes deeper than that. This is about human slavery by a massive coalition including shadow governments, dark occultists, all the way up to non-human entities. This shit goes deep. Way deeper than the idea of communism</p>

        <p>I'd say it's the age old grab for power and the insane lust of trying to control. The same game has been going on long before dawn of history. Now just with more advanced technology.</p>

        <p>The holding your breath analogy is a great one. I completely agree. I wish everyone would just stop obeying. So many people I know donâ€™t think we should be wearing masks and distancing but THEY STILL DO IT! All because they want to follow the rules and be good citizens. Stop!! Honestly, what could the gov do if everyone stopped following their arbitrary rules?</p>

        <p>If they're worried about people harassing them, remember being ignored is the hell these bullies really fear, that's why they try to force the public to pay attention to them by making an ass of themselves. Just don't join in and make an ass of themselves too.</p>
<p>That's of course ignoring the assaults some of the more pathetic bullies stoop to.</p>

        <p>These videos on the internet of some anti-masker being bullied and assaulted - I think there's been a deliberate effort to spread them around in order to make people fearful and ensure compliance. Maybe even some of the videos are fake.</p>
