    <strong>I found the likely solution for the first and ongoing lockdown with no end in sight</strong>
    <p><p>No sane government would continue to oppress it's people especially when all data indicates that it's wrong.</p>
<p>No sane person would do that.</p>
<p>Now, the important question is: what motivates people to do anything?</p>
<p>If you said, the prospect of fear or pleasure, you are right.</p>
<p>Given that fear is a better motivator than pleasure, I assume fear.</p>
<p>Therefore the governments' leaders must be in fear.</p>
<p>Now you could say, they were in fear of a virus.</p>
<p>But this fear would have left rather sooner than later given the overwhelming proof of this virus' unimportance.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is another fear.</p>
<p>I assume it is the same fear every single politician and every judge has, and that is unique to them.</p>
<p>It is the fear of loss.</p>
<p>People often say that the governments are run by special interests, and that is accurate.</p>
<p>People say that those special interests make politicians act by giving them presents.</p>
<p>I doubt that.</p>
<p>I assume <em>blackmail</em>.</p>
<p>But not the kind of blackmail you might assume as in "if you don't do that, we will move our company and jobs to a foreign country".</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Targeted blackmail.</p>
<p>As in "we found incriminating information about you and will publish it if you don't do what we want".</p>
<p>Google with its video data and face recognition technology.</p>
<p>Other AI companies.</p>
<p>People can and will find incriminating information.</p>
<p>Politicians know they will be outcast, maybe even go to jail if incriminating information about them went public. Or information about their relatives/family.</p>
<p>The same applies to judges.</p>
<p>This is how they are kept in line.</p>
<p>So if you get the chance to talk to a politician in charge.</p>
<p>Do not accuse him. Do not insult him.</p>
<p>Ask him with a concerned face in a fatherly manner:</p>
<p><strong>Are you being blackmailed?</strong></p></p>
