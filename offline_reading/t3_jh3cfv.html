    <strong>Every test is positive, even if you didn't take one.</strong>
    <p><p>My uncle had a friend who he and his family left church to get tested for corona because they all felt sick. The line they were in was taking forever, already feeling sick and having to stand there waiting they decided to leave to rest instead. No tests were done on any family member and no updates were given to anyone. Well, the church sends out a message to everyone saying he and his family tested positive.</p>
<p>How fucking bold is that!?
Nothing is said after they leave and no record of tests even being taken yet it's already "confirmed" they all have corona. Either whoever made that decision truly believes everything is corona or they know they will not be contested, in which case if it was the latter they would be right. Despite being pushed to by my uncle and others, they don't want to speak out about being falsely labeled as corona positive because hoards of the self righteous will attack them for spreading "lies" and being selfish people who don't want to quarantine. Their livelyhoods could be at risk if they say anything. We all know the strong opinions of maskers who love to throw around labels like murderer and psychopath, as well as wishing death. Overall you're not treated too kindly if you don't blindly follow with the rest. </p>
<p>I'd still contest because the amount of rage i'd have to keep inside would be worse than taking it on and it can invite other people to speak out as well, but with a family to take care of and having to face the mob in person I can see the hesitance and maybe I wouldn't be as brave as I think I would.</p>
<p>I keep getting told after the election this will fade away quickly but I really don't believe it. Time will tell and hopefully it will prove me wrong.</p></p>

        <p>I've heard very similar stories in the UK. </p>
<p>I don't think this virus is related to your election because the same stupid lock downs are happening all around the world. I'd be totally amazed if the UK lock down finished after the US election</p>

        <p>Agreed, this is why I don't see everything being reversed in just 10 days from now. How can the US make the whole world forget something like this, let alone cause it? This is way bigger than the usual pre-election controversies.</p>

        <p>Ties in with them pushing testing.  The stimulus talk is being held up on the testing and tracing, last I heard anyways.  Why are they pushing it so hard?  They want tons more testing, so they can show cases, to keep everyone afraid, to shut down more.  I am sick of it!</p>
