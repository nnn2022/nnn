    <strong>Is it even worth investing in normal life things anymore?</strong>
    <p><p>I feel really demotivated with recent news to keep doing “normal life things” when obviously it’s all falling apart. Why even pay off debt? Why even invest in a future with investments or assets? Why even build a career if we won’t be allowed to work there in the future or they may escalate into concentration camps for unvaxxed or freezing bank accounts? </p>
<p>Anyone else struggling with this?</p></p>

        <p>Invest in things that cannot be taken away. Sunrises. Long walks. Read. Write. Invest in your health. Take up running. Become an ultra runner - because doing that will teach you that pain and suffering can be fun!  </p>
<p>Play some aggressive, angry rock music and drive around with your windows down and feel the wind on your face. This whole ride lasts just for a moment. It’s not about what you build, but what you experience.</p>
<p>Fuck this whole corrupt system and just live. Hold the middle finger up to the authoritarians and resist with everything you’ve got. </p>
<p>Maybe THAT is the experience you came to this world to have. Don’t ever despair. I am 100% convinced that-in the end-everything is perfectly fine and there is no need to worry. I’m convinced of that beyond a shadow of a doubt. This is a drama, and a damn fine one at that. Enjoy the show.</p>

        <p>Yes. I’ve planned my whole life. I paid off all my debts including cars and college  except for about 1/4 of my mortgage. I delayed gratification. I am mid thirties and have a substantial nest egg saved for retirement. And now for what? While my friends bought lake houses and boats we did staycations. Now I regret everything. All this fiat currency for a crash? We built our dream home but for what? We cook all of our meals and do our own yard work. We clean our own home. I’ve been teased for being extremely frugal. Now it feels all in vein. I work long hours and make a good living but I ponder quitting a great career because I’m wondering if working 10-12 hours a day is worth it anymore. No matter what, I will not take that shot, so am I going to lose everything? I received no stimulus, pay tons in taxes and have no children. I get nothing in return. All of this for my own government to tell me to take a shot or else?</p>

        <p>Your life choices have taught you patience, perseverance and the value of hard work. They can't take that away from you.
I worry too about losing everything just because I'm not getting the shot. If that's what it comes to, then so be it.</p>

        <p>Thanks. I hear you. It just sucks because I grew up in poverty with no family. I struggled so much to do the right thing and it just feels unfair. I know life’s not fair but I was stupid because I believed hard work was all it took. And it worked for years. I just try to count the blessings I still have. But sitting in front of this computer all day morning until night has been more challenging than ever. Watching the government shutdown small businesses, print money like there’s no tomorrow, and then tell me I’m not doing my part?</p>

        <p>You're right. It's not fair to work your butt off, and still be subject to the whims of societal idiocy.
I made so many mistakes in my younger years. Ruined my life and had to build it back up from nothing. Now I have a house, cars, investments, etc., and I'm asking those same questions. I have to keep reminding myself that knowledge cannot be taken away. I've found hobbies that are teaching me useful skills, and I'm focusing on that (got into prepping and gardening) . It doesn't change the overall situation, but it does relieve my stress and hopefully leaves me better off in the end.</p>

        <p>Sounds like we have a lot of similarities. I too messed up while I was young. Fell into the same habits of my parents but was able to crawl out and make something of myself. I also took up those same hobbies! Gardening is quite peaceful and prepping gives me a sense of security, whether real or not. I also took up learning Spanish and hunting. Seems like people that HAD to use critical thinking and earn what they have are the same ones that want the right to continue to make their own decisions.</p>

        <p>That is awesome! And I agree, seems we have a lot in common.
I've been into shooting for years. Haven't been able to take up hunting yet. That's next on my list.
My family is split down the middle, half grew up in poverty and the other half in wealth. There is a clear difference in perspective between the two halves. Those influenced by wealth support government interference, and those who had to fight for every penny earned want to be left alone to make their own decisions.</p>

        <p>I feel the exact same. I feel like I can’t make any future plans. Why plan a vacation in six months, who knows if we will be able to travel? Why bother trying to get promoted at a job I’ll have to leave over vaccine mandates? I know someone who just became a real estate agent and he’s working nonstop to build his brand and deep inside all I can think is how naive he is to think there will be any housing market left a year from now. I hope I’m just being terribly cynical and negative, I really do.</p>

        <p>Because if you aren’t getting better, you are getting worse. Your mental and physical health are of the utmost importance. Even if you are pessimistic about your future at your current job, continue to develop or build new skills. The world WILL keep turning and it’s up to you to navigate for yourself.</p>

        <p>I have been investing in my 401k, paying off debts and building a decent nest egg for the last few years. It's slow going but this year I'm really seeing progress.
The last few weeks have made me reconsider everything. I'm wondering if I should empty my bank account and 401k, and hide the cash. They could very well start freezing nonvaxxers accounts. Or the market crashes and my savings will be gone.
My job recently mandated the clot shot. That means my time there is limited. There are jobs aplenty, but how many of those will soon require the death jab?</p>
<p>Basically I hear you dude/dudette. Everything right now feels like the calm before a hurricane hits. What comes could be minor, entertaining at worst. Or it could destroy everything. It's the not knowing that bothers me most.</p>

        <p>Same. I just wish I knew what was going to happen.</p>
<p>Also agree on your point with jobs. We can leave our current job due to the shot, but who’s to say most employers won’t require it soon? </p>

        <p>You can do what I’ve seen this old guy do where I live, he walks around smiling all the time with signs on his back pack that simply say things like “SAY NO TO MANDATED VACCINES.” </p>
<p>The people who swallow every word of mainstream thought will never approach the man out of fear he is one of the “plagued” ones but he probably has a very small number of confrontations with people over the signs on his back. If anything, he is probably encountering and learning who the true sane ones are, seeing as we both live in a Democrat/liberal stronghold where they have been known to publicly shame and go after the business and employment of people displaying “wrongthink.” Next time I see the man I want to go give him a hug and tell him how much I appreciate him. He has even encouraged me to do the same thing. I don’t work for anybody and I don’t make friends out of liberals/establishment loyalists so I don’t have much to worry about.</p>
<p>But in all seriousness, seek some new friends. The time you waste on those “fake” friends is energy and time you can be investing in finding your true tribe.</p>

        <p>100% Struggling. The thought running through my head is what is the point? But scripture reminds me to have hope. </p>
<p>"But let us who are of the day be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet the hope of salvation. For God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us, that whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with Him. Therefore comfort each other and edify one another, just as you also are doing." 1 Thessalonians 5:8-11</p>

        <p>I personally don't think it will get to this point everywhere. I feel like we're just riding out the storm for when these vaccinations show us they aren't the solution.</p>
<p>So I take solace in having some short term preparedness in place. Just like having 3 days of supplies to manage power outages from a hurricane, you can have supplies on hand to manage a 3 month job loss or lockdown or some event.</p>
<p>Paying off debt is important, because even in economic collapse you will still owe that money, and it will become very hard to pay off. I think being financially stable puts you in a "less bad" position if things start to fall apart. </p>
<p>Perhaps you could use the potential of an unstable future as a motivator.</p>

        <p>I totally feel you on this. I'm currently in the midst of a job search, and it seems extraordinarily difficult to figure out something I can see myself doing long term.</p>
<p>None of the jobs are truly grabbing my interest because it all feels like theres no point. </p>
<p>Im definitely confused and a bit directionless right now, but I'm continuing to trust myself and my convictions, as I watch it all unfold.</p>

        <p>There is crazy shit going on for sure. But not doing any of things will make you a slave to society and the government, now and in the future. Staying debt free means are are not beholden to anyone. Means you have more money, means you can do what you need to do when you need to do it. If you don’t invest for the future, then you will not have a future. If you roll over now, than you will be in the same place in 10 -20-30 yrs. and there will be a future... the world will not disappear.  Find a career or a company with like minded people. Many people see the writing on the wall, surround  yourself with those that have your back. Take your concern, and find solutions to them, that’s how you stay free. Start creating the box you want to live in.</p>

        <p>I stopped saving above an emergency fund and we kitted out the house. There is very little point in money when inflation is going to destroy currency anyway. If we are stuck at home because we refuse to show a vaccine pass might as well kit out the home enjoy the time you have in luxury in my opinion.</p>

        <p>That is the most likely outcome of all this, but don’t despair—knowing that in advance does give you the advantage of having time to prepare. Pay back your debts because it’s right to give back to others what they are due, not for your own selfish gain. Invest in precious metals and a strategically located home on plenty of land because it’ll help you to barter, grow food, and survive in the future. Build relationships with people both in your neighborhood and at work; these people will remember your kindness and help you when the going gets tough. </p>
<p>There still is a point in action, though action now may look a little different from what it once did.</p>

        <p>I’m actually just glad I spent a decent amount of money and time being a crazy hoe in my early 20s, travelling overseas, going on dates with guys that look like anime characters, getting all manner of beauty treatments, going to occasional outrageous events and parties, dropping serious cash on shopping sprees in Japan. I mean I busted a lot of my savings doing so and almost got abducted at one point but how things have turned out I don’t regret it in the least. Maybe I’m an idiot but I had a great time. Honestly if not for doing the most like this what is the point of living??? I didn’t come into this existence just to be “safe” and sensible and do all the “right” things.</p>

        <p>I'm still working off debt so that it can't be held over me, but my future life plans now are just to be able to live off the grid. That's all I am focusing and studying on now. I'm miserable as fuck wondering when work will force masks again or mandate the jab. Wondering if I'll have to start homeschooling my kid soon. I'd love to do it, but I have to work. It's all shit and I hate it. I'm honestly surprised I'm not depressed.</p>

<p>OP I became a realtor this past year. It's an investment of over 2 grand over time but if you're working full time you can donit in 6 months and the payoff if worth it if you can sell just one house.</p>
<p>Download Unity and follow free courses online and make a video game! Or an animated video!</p>
<p>Then write a book about said game/video.</p>
<p>Then write a book about how you became a realtor, developer, and writer all at once.</p>
<p>I should probably follow my own advice lol</p>

        <p>I really stopped giving a shit about it all. It's clear America is a doomed country and nobody can do anything to stop the satanic pedophiles that are causing the doom. Fuck society, it's a nightmare. Tech has destroyed life as much as it improved it.</p>
<p>Maybe it's just depression, who knows. The vax companies can probably hook you up with something for that though</p>

        <p>Invest in your faith if you believe in a creator and you will be forged in fire and come out on a higher plane.</p>
<p>No one can destroy the spirit unless we allow them to. The spirit only grows and thrives when put through fire and this is a spiritual war. It is absolutely a spiritual war. </p>
<p>Chaos is part of the plan. People protesting the vaccine is part of the plan and i don't say that because i think they shouldn't protest. Of course they should.</p>
<p>The issue is that they don't want you to awaken that fire inside, the spiritual fire which is unquenchable.
They want to dissipate all your energy. They want you to absolutely yearn for freedom and make that physical freedom the only goal. By doing so, they take a part of you ransom. </p>
<p>Under the communist regime, people suffered extreme persecution for over half a century. All of them wanted freedom and rightly so but the ones who  magnified the inner self, the spirit, kept their freedom intact throughout.</p>

        <p>Just as this was ramping up last year a beautiful young woman close to my family was murdered. Since she spent so much time at our house I feel her all the time encouraging me not to give up. I get the strong feeling that very special people are here right now to make the world better. We are all fucking warriors and we know it. Let’s ride together and show what we’re made of! You know what try putting on the song Livin on a Prayer by Bon Jovi and sing the heck out of it… guaranteed to make u feel better! “Woah we’re half way there… woah… livin on a prayer… take my hand and we’ll make it I swear… woah livin on a prayer:)</p>
