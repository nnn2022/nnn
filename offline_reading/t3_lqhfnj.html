    <strong>So let me get this straight.</strong>
    <p><p>Doctors are lying to you? All forms of government(even ones from other countries) are lying to you? Friends are lying to you? Nurses are lying to you? The majority of the public is lying to you? Scientists are lying to you? All the media is lying to you? But you’ll believe some article from something like goatmilknews747472.com or a meme made by u/frieddickpickles87 is telling the truth? Guys, what’s the point of life if you put no trust in anyone or anything? No offense that seems like a shitty and sad life to live :/</p></p>

        <p>Everyone is telling the truth, you are just not listenning.</p>
<p>You've been told that masks don't work, mutliple times, by doctors and  by the government. You are being told right now vaccine is not efficient and will not lead to deconfinement. You are being told right now that this is forever, and this is the new normal.</p>
<p>No one is really lying dude. Yes, people put spotlights on different things, and emphazise different things, but most people most of the time says the truth, including the government. You just need to listen closer.</p>

        <p>If no lies are involved are you able to answer my questions below? </p>
<p>Why is no one talking about the lockdown costs and the suffering they cause? Why no news stories ever cover anything that would cast a shadow of a doubt over them? I thought media thrived on controversy and yet, nobody is talking about any of this. And there is a lot to talk about.</p>
<p>If you have a good answer for why the death and suffering of hundreds of thousands - most likely millions - of people is not newsworthy, I'll stop believing that the media and governments are lying.</p>

        <p>OP, the issue here is that the government (all forms), the media, the nurses, the doctors and even friends are lying by omission. In other words, they are not being completely honest, and leaving out the finer details.</p>
<p>It is the equivalent of me telling you, yes, there is pandemic, and it will possibly kill you. However, but I leave out important facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>it affects people who are mostly elderly because of their age, and </li>
<li>affects people who have severe compromised immune systems (HIV folks, diabetics, people with cancer, etc.)</li>
<li>you have a 99.9% survival rate, and at most you'll get a the sniffles or cold</li>
<li>if you're healthy and strong, it is less likely to affect you</li>
</ul>
<p>A lie by omission is still a lie!</p>

        <p>I wouldn't put it that way.<br>
I'd say people come to different conclusions and develop different opinions based on the experiences they made up until that point in their lives.<br>
I would define lying as deliberately saying something that differs from what someone thinks is the truth.<br>
So when someone thinks that their perception is equivalent to reality and makes a statement that contradicts my perception, then I wouldn't consider that as lying.<br>
I'd say that's simply having different perspectives about the same issue.</p>
<p>When it comes to believing into things people say, I usually tend to assign likelihoods to how close what they say could be to reality. I almost never assign a likelihood of 100% to anything anyone says. That usually only happens when my own perception led to the same conclusion and I've never heard anyone contradict with that statement. For example: "Sunlight is warm".</p>
<p>When it comes to things that I personally can neither confirm nor disprove, I always tend to assign a much lower likelihood to the statement reflecting reality.</p>
<p>In cases like that you'll often see me asking questions like: "How did you come to that conclusion?" in order to find out if there's a way for me to personally confirm their statement that I've been overlooking thus far. Oftentimes people just refer to external sources to back their claims. This usually doesn't alter my likeliness evaluation all that much.</p>
<p>When it comes to microbiology, I think that a lot of what is being treated as facts are mere interpretations of what someone has observed and then taking that interpretation as a premise for further interpretations and theories where the origin eventually gets lost.</p>
<p>So what I'm saying is that I'm seeing contradictions, missing pieces and unconfirmed premises when it comes to reenacting the thought process between what was actually observed and the suggested course of action as a result of that observation.</p>
<p>The people whom I trust the most are the ones who label their thoughts, believes and opinions as what they are rather than trying to convince me that their thoughts, believes and opinions are the one and only truth.</p>
