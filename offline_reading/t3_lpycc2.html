<p>So...</p>
<p><strong>what you should do with this information?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Send these links to pressure politicians and policy makers on social media</li>
<li>Send these links to <em>unelected</em> public officials (Fauci and his state and county equivalents)</li>
<li>Send these links to mainstream media organizations as story ideas - right, left, center, big, small, and social media influencers</li>
<li>Use it when people say 500,000 Americans or 100,000 UK have died from Corona</li>
<li>Use it when people say that restrauants, gyms, and entertainment needs to remain closed or at reduced capacity</li>
<li>Use Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to demand Covid data and policy discussions from state, local, and national officials</li>
<li>Use Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to see if foreign agents influenced lockdown policy decisions (see the FBI director's quote in the Tablet Mag article)</li>
<li>Use it to show the world that the narrative has been intentionally manipulated</li>
<li>Encourage media organizations to use Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to demand Covid data and policy discussions</li>
<li>Don't use your energy to try to change doomer's minds.  Post the links as a response and walk away.</li>
<li>Do use your energy to put pressure on public officials and people with large audiences</li>
<li>Demand that public officials show us not only data but their models, methodologies, and assumptions</li>
<li>Use social media to put pressure on media organizations to report these things to the general public</li>
<li>"Sunlight is the best disinfectant" - Supreme court justice Louis Brandeis</li>
<li><strong>Don't ask once, don't post these links just once.  Hammer on them over and over and over.  Don't stop until things are back to normal.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Cracks are appearing in the narrative.  Use this information and these techniques to obliterate it so we can win our lives back!</p></p>

<p>(1) Never use airlines, bus, etc. so long as they mandate masks.</p>
<p>(2) Avoid paying giant corporations whenever you can. Support small, local business. </p>
<p>(3) Take up outdoor, unmasked hobbies. Refuse to go to indoor places that require masks. </p>
<p>(4) Gather privately with like-minded individuals whenever and however you can. </p>
<p>(5) In the USA: flee the blue states. Never vote Democrat or RINO,</p>

        <p>Fantastic list.  Much appreciated.  Unfortunately, there are too many Clownsheep© that only watch MSM and listen to Democrat lawmakers.  It's like they don't even care if they know they are wrong; they just don't want to admit it.</p>
<p>My other, always point is:  If you are fedup run for a position on your local council, school board, any political position you can find.  We have to start getting these positions back bc as we've seen through the lockdowns even a Commisioner or mayor can overrule a Governor or President.....CRAAAAAZZZZYYY</p>

        <p>Sorry but if someone sends me the „Dr Birx says all deaths of people with covid are counted as covid deaths” I’m gonna laugh that woman was literally working for Donald Trump, the man who claimed covid was a „hoax” - and while we can disagree whether authoritarian rules that are meant to „save” us from covid are not neccesarily needed, we can all agree that covid exists and kills people.</p>
<p>Second - real clear politics is a website biased towards… you guessed it, Donald Trump, it’s even in their wikipedia article.</p>
<p>So sorry but if a website that is biased towards a liar who thinks covid doesn’t exist uses a statement from a woman working for a liar who thinks covid doesn’t exist, and that statement is aligned with the liar’s agenda and has <em>no</em> actual backing whatsoever then I think you shouldn’t send anyone this link as it’s just pure lies.</p>
<p>Before someone gets angry for labeling trump as a liar - you can be republican or democrat and you can have diffrent views on diffrent things but- trump has said about (unverified) 20 000 lies during his term in office (there’s even an art installation that involves all of them, although I’m not sure whether it’s even remotely accurate). I’m talking about information that you can google and it comes up as false, I’m talking about him saying that injecting yourself with detergent will help cure covid… Let’s face it, no matter what god you believe in or whether you think masks should be mandatory or not, you can’t say that trump isn’t a liar and you can’t say calling him a liar is an offence.</p>

        <p>It ain't much better in MA. The silver lining is that cops here give zero fucks. Zero. I've been going maskless on buses and subway for about a month now and no transit cop has ever said anything. In fact, last week one of them even scanned his own subway pass to open the turnstile for me when he saw I was rushing to get a train. I have my own pass, but I appreciate the gesture all the same.</p>

        <p>Cops might not, but a ton of businesses do, some even say outright "we're required by law* [sic] to demand this of you."</p>
<p>The ridiculous amount of people with masks on alone outdoors <em>in spacious suburbs</em> is the thing that baffles me, "public mask mandate" or not. Not a single known case of outdoor COVID outside of 2020's arson mobs, yet at least half the people are muzzled. And it's not just because of winter, they did it in a relatively warm November, too. </p>

        <p>Businesses are required to post the signs, sure. But enforcement is another issue. Walking into Walmart with a mask and then taking it off inside hasn't raised any eyebrows. A few stores had places ask "sir do you have a mask?" I've politely told them "I don't, sorry" and kept walking. A few places are willing to escalate, but they're rare.</p>

        <p>It's more than signs. I've had a hostess demand I cover my nose with a mask at a restaurant; I've had a dental assistant freak out like a complete psycho about the same thing with <em>literally nobody else inside</em> except them and the dentist in full filtered N95's and face shields -- despite her being in the room working in my wide open mouth for a full half-hour a few minutes later. Oh, and I had called ahead and supposedly been cleared about my sinus issues where masks are only tolerable when I'm nose-dicking. </p>
<p>The restaurant relented, but the dentist's assistant did not, with an "apology" that was basically "Sorry, but not really sorry, because gLoBaL pAnDeMiC." </p>
<p>I'm over 6 feet tall and a big dude who's well over 200 pounds, so I'm not sure what it is about me that is such a Karen magnet for getting hassled. Oddly, no non-medical personnel bother me at all if I substitute a face shield. I'm not sure if it's because they think I'm extra-hardcore, or because it's what places like Costco want for people with exceptions, or if it makes me look crazy enough they don't want any trouble. </p>
<p>I'd definitely go bareface in protest if I knew where there'd be another, say, 10-20 people doing it.</p>

        <p>That’s what I’m saying. So many people are so stupid that they would rather wear a mask and not be around anyone then they would look at the facts and say hmm... all deaths as long as you have covid count as a covid death. So if I had covid and got hit by a car, I died to covid? I didn’t know covid knew how to drive. It’s so stupid. People are scared of dying to a new cold that has a 99.98% survival rate. It’s so damn stupid.</p>
