    <strong>Mods and visitors from offmychest accept the "new normal" blindly</strong>
    <p><p>You might know "r/offmychest". A subreddit that has those rules for itself:</p>
<ol>
<li>We are good to each other.</li>
<li>No oppressive attitudes and language.</li>
<li>We stay on-topic.</li>
<li>We reject harmful behaviors.</li>
<li>We cooperate to build this community.</li>
</ol>
<p>I wrote this there:</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>There IS no danger</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I feel utterly helpless when seeing so many people sucked into the narrative that we had a pandemic.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;It makes me crazy beyond all measure that <strong>most</strong> people believe the narrative to a t and support the measures against the people.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>Most</strong> people are immune to scientists proving that there IS NO DANGER.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;If there was a majority of people sabotaging the measures wherever possible, I wouldn't be so concerned, but what does concern me is that a majority plays along willingly, even restrict themselves more voluntarily.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;And by majority I am talking about the people on the streets, not a distorted view by the internet.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;People wear masks even when they don't have to.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;No amount of valid data will convince them, they are controlled by the media and the state, who work together.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;It is one thing to know that most states of the world are out to destroy businesses with ruthless intent, but it's on a different level to assume that this was done with good intentions.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;There is a single benefit I see in this: people who wear masks in public when they don't have to would never make good friends, because they are opportunists who would snitch whenever they have the option to. They neither have a backbone nor friends who have a backbone.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Whenever I see people without masks, I immediately know that they are likely to become good friends.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;You can see the ones who obey as depicted in "They live", but this time you don't need glasses.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;EDIT: A PCR test can neither detect infection nor the presence of pathogens capable of replication.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;For this reason alone, it is not a legal basis for measures. "The Senate Administration declared that in connection with the law, it must be a "reproductive agent (virus, bacterium, fungus, parasite) or other biological transmissible agent that can cause an infection or communicable disease in humans" in order to be called a "pathogen".<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;In response to the deputy's question as to whether "a so-called PCR test is capable of distinguishing between a 'replicable' and a 'nonreplicable' virus", the Senate Administration answered with a "no".<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;What a PCR test finds also says nothing about whether "another biological transmissible agent that can cause infection or transmissible disease in humans" is present.</p>
<p>All replies were abusive.</p>
<p>I reported them for almost all of their rules, the comments stayed.</p>
<p>Instead</p>
<ol>
<li>My post was removed:</li>
</ol>
<p>&rt;<strong>Sorry, this post has been removed by the moderators of</strong> r/offmychest**.**Moderators remove posts from feeds for a variety of reasons, including keeping communities safe, civil, and true to their purpose.</p>

        <p>Well maybe it planted some seeds in someone there. I've tried to talk to people myself but none of these people want to listen to reason, they love their chains and hysteria. It feels so strange to get insulted by people you are trying to save walking right into an elaborate trap that is only going to get worse if the masses allow it. You have a better chance of finding bigfoot than you do of getting convid-19.</p>

        <p>That sub sucks. They used to autoban you just for posting or commenting on certain subs. Back when the donald was all over r/all back in 2016 I commented on one of the stupid posts there, then I immediately got the message saying "You have now been banned from r /offmychest"</p>

        <p>I’d send a message to the mods like they said you can. Tell them they’re being hypocrites, and maybe empower them to allow free thinking on their sub. </p>
<p>People are so spineless these days they can’t hear or talk to anyone that disagrees w them. As a moderator, they have the power to change that and bring folks together, expanding human consciousness. They’re missing out imo. </p>
<p>Good on ya for saying something. Hopefully some folks w critical thinking saw your post</p>
