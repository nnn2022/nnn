    <strong>"More than 20,000 people were forced to undergo sterilization under California’s decades-long eugenics program." New York Times (but you can trust us now, why would we hurt you? We only want what's best for you.)</strong>

<p><em>Under the influence of a movement known as eugenics, whose supporters believed that those with physical disabilities, psychiatric disorders and other conditions were “genetically defective,” more than 60,000 people across the United States were forcibly sterilized by state-run programs throughout the 20th century.</em></p>
<p><em>Even after California repealed its eugenics law in 1979, it continued to sterilize women in prison, sometimes without ensuring that their consent was lawfully obtained,</em> <a href="http://www.auditor.ca.gov/pdfs/reports/2013-120.pdf"><em>according to a 2014 state report</em></a> <em>that followed an exposé by the</em> <a href="https://revealnews.org/article/female-inmates-sterilized-in-california-prisons-without-approval/"><em>Center for Investigative Reporting</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p><em>Now, under a budget passed by the Legislature and awaiting the governor’s approval, California is prepared to spend $7.5 million to find and pay an estimated 600 surviving victims of coerced sterilization, both under the eugenics law and in prison. Because not all of those victims are likely to be found, the ones that are may end up receiving about $25,000 each.</em></p></p>
