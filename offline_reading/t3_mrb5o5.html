        <p>Divide and conquer. By forcing people to wear masks you naturally divide them into those that obey blindly and those that do not, similar to wearing a prison outfit, a star of David, the wrong gang or team colors, wrong skin color, being a witch...</p>
<p>As we all know this difference gives people a sense of entitlement to treat the "subhumans" inhumanely, including murder.</p>
<p>People who marginalize others for not wearing a mask are the ones who in the past joined the mobs that killed people for no other reason than being different. I'm sure accusing their victims of spreading disease was a common justification for their despicable behavior.</p>
<p>It's why I argue that discrimination against vaccination is racism. On a biological level this is correct, but on a cultural level in the west it has become a taboo to discriminate based on race, gender, sexuality... Those in power must be really pleased they have something new to control people with.</p>

        <p>3 steps to get out of the madness...</p>
<p>1 ) pharmaceutical and surgical quick fixes never work fully... they mostly weaken the natural immune systems self-healing capacities<br>
anyone who is abusing emergency laws to divert people s attention away from their own self-healing capacities and towards the pharmaceutical /surgical medicine business makes itself a complice towards a dehumanising depopulation agenda what envisions the avarage citizen as complying with every chemical/pharmaceutical business furthering political regulation, feeding itselve voluntarily with health-deteriorating sterilising toxic chemicals</p>
<p>to insist on freedom of movement, freedom of assembly being most important for body autonomy<br>
( to be able to choose at all times where to be with whom is an essential requirement for supporting ones body fitness wellness ) equates opposing global guidelines locking down/phasing out individual personal sovereign behaviour</p>
<p>=</p>
<p>lockdown, masks, vaccines<br>
bad<br>
----</p>
<p>free movement, free assembly, body autonomy<br>
good</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
2 ) regional state and nation state dominating the local community ( village/town/city ) = bad</p>
<p>sollution: renewal of states constitutions so that all political hierarchies get dissolved and all political decision powers get shifted towards the local community, abdication of regional and nation state in favor of the local community receiving full absolute sovereignity<br>
the (full) assembly of all children, youth and adults being permanent residents of the local community, each one with the very same weighted voting power, creating, maintaining and interpreting the laws what are valid within the territory of the local sovereign community<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
3 ) once the local community has become its own absolute sovereign, it might use the inherited material and financial wealth of the abdicated regional and nation state to buy agricultural and forest land from private owners ... with the intention to redistribute land towards everyone who does not have private wealth<br>
a lifetime loan of 1000 m2 without tax duty without rent duty envisioned for every human being on earth so that everyone may be free of having to serve anyone else, so that everyone may be free to build its own house with its own hands and grow its own vegan foodstuffs</p>

        <p>i have a masters degree in behavior analysis and literally every single thing they've done because of this "pandemic" is a tactic for behavior-change procedures : using seperation/fear to cause stress so that people will do anything to be back around people and so that their bodies are more susceptible to illness, reinforcing mask-wearing behavior and vaccinations with the ability to do previously normal activities, removing the ability to rejoin society as a punishment for not complying......</p>
