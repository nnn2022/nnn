    <strong>Anyone ever tried googling/duckduckgoing the PURPOSE off a vaccine passport?</strong>
    <p><p>I tried it, i can find what it does or what you can do with it and cetra  but  the purpose never seems to be mentioned.
 Try it just for fun and post your findings in comments if you want to. 
You don't have to agree with what you find off course,cause from the moment they admitted you can still transfer the virus after the shot, there absolutely is non.</p></p>

        <p>OK, this is not from any MSM source.  This is just me using my logic and pattern prediction, coupled with various stated goals given in the past.</p>
<p>First order of effect is "contact tracing".  Anyone that thinks that a VaxPass is just a "read only" event is sadly mistaken.  When you use your VaxPass, a record is created.. person X is at location Y at time Z.  This way, according to the narrative, If you come up positive, they can look at everything you have done, and "alert" the people you were around.</p>
<p>That's the reasoning.</p>
<p>Now, I tend to think that it's going to go far, far beyond that, because politicians are not known for letting a good crisis go to waste.</p>
<p>Lets say, you have to get 1/2 shots now.  But they authorize a booster.  Now you have to get the booster if you want to continue getting the "benefits".  Say next year, a new issue comes up... or "climate change" measures restricts your travel... the government is going to know who is actually moving around, quite easily now.</p>
<p>If they can get it implemented fully, it probably won't just be done for admission to places.  Imagine the checking being at the checkout as well.  Now the government can have a list of what all you are buying... which is especially important if you are buying "more than your fair share"... such as, say, buying food for a friend or relative that cannot legally buy for themselves due to the vax status.  Or just buying "more ammo" than they feel is necessary to have.</p>
<p>Do you really need the government involving themselves in your private decisions?</p>
<p>Lets say you tend to go to the same bar/restaurant once a week to meet up with friends.  One of those friends suddenly becomes a "person of interest" to the gov... and now they know who all this person meets with on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Let me state that I'm not a religious person by any stretch of the imagination, and I've been listening to people predict the end of the world for a long, long time, and just laughing it off.  I'm personally starting to get a bit suspicious that we may actually have something to worry about now.  I really don't like where this pattern is going.</p>

        <p>Tbh i haven‚Äôt found one either but it‚Äôs somewhere along the line of ‚Äúhealth and safety‚Äù</p>
<p>For me it‚Äôs just more control. They want to control you and know everything you do. Remember what WEF said: you will own nothing, you will have no privacy, and you will be happy</p>

        <p>Yes i agree completely i think its only about control and pushing people to Vax up but you would think that somewhere along the line there should be some official comment or article about "yes you can still transfer covid but for this and this reason you will still need a passport"</p>
