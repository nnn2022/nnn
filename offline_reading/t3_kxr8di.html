        <p>Curious what the consensus is about when the tipping point will be for most people? </p>
<p>How many personal freedoms do they have to lose before they stop complying or will they ever?</p>
<p>Mine personally came and went with face masks. No government has the right to tell you what you can or can't wear in public, beyond a basic indecent exposure law.</p>

        <p>It's really simple actually, no contact = no virus spreading, therefore 2 weeks lockdown = 2 weeks of no virus spreading = a virus free country. But of course, a virus to you idiots needs to have some big government conspiracy behind it, when really all of the governments actions have just been panicked reactions to the idiots they can't control for just two weeks.</p>

        <p>I don’t get any handouts, asshole. I’ve been saving money for college since I was 12 and I have a really good paying job for my age. It would be even better pay if the restaurant I work at could be fully open, but sadly you idiots made the restrictions necessary, and that made my job less profitable. So no, it’s not “fuck the government” it’s fuck <strong>you</strong>. </p>
<p>If it weren’t for you assholes, we could be like New Zealand right now, fully open and back to normal, but because you’re too fragile and selfish to deal with some short term inconvenience, you dragged it out to a year or more for <em>everyone</em>- a massive slap to the face of those who did their part to try and leave this in the past.</p>

        <p>no dear because I'm 'essential' I don't get that option.  I'd have LOVED the option of sitting home for two weeks on 65% pay debating online with people like you.  hell if I test positive I get 65% pay for 2 weeks minimum.  I'll take it.  Don't really NEED the money but it's nice to have.  But, sadly, instead I'm on day 27 now of I don't know how many more in a row of being 'essential'.  Next 'argument' please?  Oh and here's the kicker.  Since I'm so 'essential' I have to be there every day BUT make sure I don't go over 40 so they don't have to pay me overtime.  THANK you and yours for panicking and making my every waking hour a walking nightmare.  I'd love to have the energy to make love to my wife or play with my dogs.  Instead here I sit arguing with panicked sheep for entertainment because my body clock is all jacked up from going to work at 4:00 in the morning but having to leave at no later than 7:00 in the morning so I don't go into overtime just so you can get a can of peas or a box of cat litter.  God forbid the giant corporation doesn't make another $5 so you and yours can eat a good home cooked meal while I squeezed 8 hours worth of work and training new people into 3 so you can prance down the aisle wearing your mask proudly and feeling SO superior to everyone because you're following the trend and buying into the bullshit.  Just and FYI.  Every retail worker you meet probably hates you on sight.  I know everybody in my store hates the mask and hates you militant maskers.  Not just dislikes.  Actively hates.  Every time we get a militant masker in our store we all roll our eyes and laugh at them internally because we've been on the front line since this shit started.  Out of 140 average employees we've had exactly 4 infected.  Oh my god this disease is SO infectious.  It's worse than Captain Tripps.</p>

        <p>I'm talking about back in March, I'm sorry that your current situation is so dire, believe me, I am, but what I'm arguing is that we would be normal by now if we had just done the hard part at the very beginning. I'm also pretty damn sure everything you're complaining about there is your employer, not the government... Anyways, arguing with you isn't worth my time so I'll cap this off here.</p>

        <p>Why? because you're not 'winning' the argument?  We're not in a sub where you can summon all of your 'friends' to gang bang me?  I've shot holes in all of your theories and so you're going to just quit and run?  LOL.  And I don't consider my situation 'dire'.  It's a bitch ya.  But that's life and circumstances.   But you people CAUSED it.  And keep causing it with your panicky, chicken little, follow the crowd, mentality. Do you not realize that people like me laugh at and mock you?  You people are seriously a laughingstock.  'ermagawd ermagawd new disease we might die.  Shut down the country foweve.  Must not die pwease gawd don't let the bad people make me die'.  So I have to change my life because you people are a bunch of dumb, dangerous, panicky, animals, that couldn't form an opinion on their own if they were given the premise of black is the opposite of white and would have to wait for some 'expert' on CNN or Facebook to back that thought up?  OOOOOkaaay spunky.  Well anyway farewell to you. It's been amusing to shoot your nonsensical ramblings to hell.  I do hope you don't catch COVID and die although that is a possibility.  But I also hope that some day you grow all the way up and learn to think for yourself.</p>

        <p>I was trying to be respectful and agree to disagree, but by god, man, you don't need to be so demeaning. When you think so little of people, that's how you make enemies. I actually started to see things from your perspective for a second there but then you proved that you think nothing of me, so why should I even try? Just a word of advice, maybe don't assume that anyone who's not anti-mask is a government sheep who just eats up all the shit from the news, because while I do agree with a lot of what the government has to say (i'm canadian btw) I don't just mindlessly agree and I'm actually firmly against the guidelines put in place in Ontario as of yesterday. I have a mind of my own, I make my own opinions. </p>

<p>Looking earlier in this conversation I realize I wasn't really respecting you earlier, and I apologize for that, I was letting my emotions get the better of me.</p>

        <p>correct.. which is why I got a bit defensive.  Want to start over with this debate?  I apologize as well.  Look man you have your opinion I have mine. That's cool.  To me that makes the world go around as far as I see it.  I like cheap American beer.  So maybe you like expensive craft beers.  But for me to mock you for liking them or you to mock me for liking mine doesn't really produced fruit.  So leave it alone.</p>
<p>Here's my real position.  </p>
<p>If a person really thinks COVID is that dangerous by all means wear a mask AND gloves in public.  If they think that keeps them safer then by all means do it.  I have no issue with that.  </p>
<p>What I DO have an issue with is being told that I have to, being abused, harassed, and generally treated as sub human, because no amount of shouting, posting 'facts' that I don't believe, or any other action, is going to convince me that no matter what steps I take I'm not going to be exposed to it.  </p>
<p>Different opinions and that's cool.  But, at the end of the day, your personal safety is your business.  It's not up to me to make you safe.  If you or your mask crowd thinks you should wear them and gear up to stay safe by all means do so.  I don't think it helps but whatever makes you feel good is cool.  But don't think for one second I'm going to like you or yours making me do something I don't want to do, am uncomfortable with, and can actually cause serious health problems for me.  </p>
<p>You see me in a grocery store without a mask?  By all means avoid me like the plague.  If I happen to wander into your 'danger zone' ask me to step away politely and I will.  </p>
<p>Come at me and try to shame me for not wearing one?  You'll probably go to sleep involuntarily.  </p>
<p>To me the most militant maskers need to live the example, stay at home, use curbside, and leave the rest of the world alone to figure it out.</p>
<p>Okay I work at a grocery store.  I watch people.  I'm an observer of people so let me tell you what I see.  Here comes soccer mom with her herd of brats.  They have 'masks' but they're not really wearing them.  They're handling everything their little grubby hands can reach.  If they've got COVID they're spreading it through the store and anybody that touches what they touched and then rub their nose just shoved a dose of it right up there.  </p>
<p>Along comes farmer brown and he's wearing his mask but no gloves.  Okay (have you noticed that very few people wear gloves) he hates it but thinks that he has to or he can't shop there.  We don't really care to be honest.  Both mom and Farmer Brown go to their respective vehicles and take off their masks.  The FIRST thing most people do is wipe their faces.  Just sit in a parking lot and watch someday.  They scratch the itch from the mask, rub their nose, and wipe across their mouth. If they have it then it's all over their hands.  So mom goes to Sonic and orders food.  Hands her debit card to the car hop.  Farmer Brown goes to the convenience store for a six pack and a pack of Red Man and uses the keypad.  So far mom has potentially given COVID to the car hop, the staff, their families, and friends. Farmer brown has potentially given COVID to everybody who touches the counter and the keypad for the next 3 to 5 hours.  </p>
<p>You maskers are need to differentiate between potential and actual and realize that this is a virus.  There is no running or hiding from it.  No matter what you do unless you seal yourself in a plastic bubble for a couple of years you're going to be exposed to it.  Sorry.  i didn't do that.  Nor do I think it's my responsibility to worry about your health.  I could die tomorrow and neither you nor the world would little note nor long remember me.  So could you. For our families and friends it would be a tragedy.  In the big picture it's just a number.  </p>
<p>Sounds cold and harsh but that's reality my friend.  I choose to just move along and live. If COVID, my heart condition, a drunk driver, a meteor, or sudden liver failure gets me, well okay.  It's just moving on to the next plane anyway and my wife looks STUNNING in black.  Might replace me at the funeral.  I'm sure there will be a line of willing applicants.  And, while I take it somewhat seriously that it exists, I personally feel it's overblown and has been manipulated into scaring a large portion of the populace into compliance of something that I can't put my finger on.</p>
<p>I don't think it's truly left wing or right wing.  I think it goes deeper than that.</p>
<p>Of course that's just my opinion.  I could be wrong.  And I don't care.  </p>
<p>I'm just going to live my life the way I want.  If a store says I can't come in without a mask I won't.  No big deal their competition is right down the street.  I won't make a scene.  I'll put one on or walk away.  If you see me without a mask then just avoid me.  There or online.  What's the point of even arguing about it because, as I said, these arguments bear no fruit.</p>

        <p>I’ve actually pondered my thoughts quite a bit and I’ve realized that I was thinking about this all the wrong way. Sure, lockdowns would help some, but I was naive to think that a 2 week lockdown would eradicate the virus. I think the main problem that is being dealt with right now was the fact that the government wasn’t fast enough to take action. Borders should have been closed long before they were but sadly, that can’t be fixed. That’s not to say I don’t think that anti maskers are somewhat harmful, because I do, and honestly my main problem with them is that they put me at risk because as we know, masks protect the people around you from your virus, not yourself from other peoples virus. At the end of the day, I think it’s the governments fault for not closing the borders soon enough, and everything that has happened from then until now has just been a failed attempt at correcting past mistakes, making it a problem of the citizens.</p>

Most retail grocery stores now offer curbside service and mandate that their employees wear masks (just an fyi I've never seen one curbside person fully sterilize before they took groceries out but I digress).  You and your kind have the ability to hide in your holes and wait it out while me and my kind say 'fuck it if it gets me it gets me' and go live life.  Now tell me oh WISE one who is being selfish here?  I'm okay with you wearing your mask or your hazmat suit in public.  I'll chuckle at you of course but I'll leave you alone.  But you and your kind are trying to FORCE people like me to acquiesce to your point of view.  You're screaming, harassing, and generally acting like a bunch of spoiled children that aren't getting their way towards people who just want to live their lives.  </p>
<p>Now don't get me wrong.  Militant anti maskers annoy me just as much as people like you do.  If a store, club, or any other place of public gathering, tells me I can't come in without a mask. Cool.  I have three choices.  A) don't come in, B) leave or C) put a mask on. That's pretty simple as far as I'm concerned  There is no reason to make a scene out of the situation.  They have the same options I and they have that I just laid out for you.  </p>
<p>Okay you don't care about being banned from this sub.  Then let me ask you.  Why are you here spouting your stuff?  Does it make you feel like some kind of internet 'hero' going into a sub that you know your opinions won't be welcome in and spouting thoughts that are contrary to the vibe?  Do you think that you, singly, in all your righteous indignation are going to change one single mind in this sub?  Or are you just looking to show your 'friends' what a righteous warrior you are.</p>
<p>Personally I think you're a parody because you obviously want to be told what to do and when.  You do not want to think for yourself and you're following the crowd so you can be popular.</p>
<p>Trust me I'm a student of human behavior and I've seen this nonsense way too many times in my life.  The 'cool kids' that think 'this is the way to go' suck the 'not so cool kids' into following the herd.  Next thing that's the norm and if you're not doing it you're not 'cool'.  People like me sit back and laugh at people like you because you don't think for yourself. We don't care about being popular or accepted.  The funniest thing is.  We're usually the ones that start the trend.  </p>
<p>Hell I was all about the mask at first until I realized that the mortality rate was 1% or less (ya got that info from a buddy at CDC early on and went 'oh.. okay.. fuck this shit').  Granted the numbers 'look' horrific.  But in reality they're really not when you consider the total population of the world.  It's sad individually and I do empathize with people who lose loved ones. But coming from someone who held his best friends hand when he died of leukemia when they were both 15 and now that's a pretty treatable disease, who grew up in fear of cancer and now THAT is usually a pretty treatable disease, dealt with the SARS scare, the swine flu scare, Legionarries disease scare, antrax scare, and on and on and on.  The massive over reaction to COVID is not only inconvenient to me it is annoying.  Because people like YOU are running around screaming 'the sky is falling' when in reality it is not. </p>
<p>Here's the thing spunky.  I know you and your side don't want to hear it but it's the truth.  COVID is a 'virus'.  Now do you want to know how many virus have been 'cured'?  ZERO.  Vaccines have been developed to help immunity bolster but 'cured'?  ZERO.  Virus mutates and wants to stay alive.  So sooner or later regardless of your mask, your clean habits, your shot, you're going to be exposed to it in one form or fashion and it's going to be up to your immune system or mine to see if life jumps up and plucks a healthy one out of the herd.  No matter what you do you will ingest virus particles of this particular disease.  I wish you good luck that you don't become a statistic and I mean that whole heartedly but your fear does not give you the right to tell me how to life my life nor criticize me for it.</p>
<p>Good day sir.</p>
