    <strong>Covid is a rich man's utopia system</strong>
    <p><p>I think covid is a rich people system and this is why.</p>
<p>All small businesses are getting shutdown and becomes bankrupt a lot of people loses their job and can't even work but big businesses like corporations or government jobs will still be active so the people rely on corporations and governments to work.</p>
<p>And all those people that didn't lose their job because they work for a corporation or government they feel like nothing is wrong because they are getting good government support meanwhile a lot of small and mid class businesses are getting bankrupt.</p>
<p>Now all the people that lost their jobs or even family because of the isolation are getting pissed off the longer it goes on, while the people that chose to work for corporations or government because they have no other choice profits from this and so they defend the system at all cost.</p>
<p>Because of them defending it at all cost they will do everything to get this propoganda alive for their profit and pushes a government agenda because they don't want to lose their corporate job or government job and when people has to rely on government they will do anything to keep the job even if it's lying to the public.</p>
<p>Now with all that money corporations and governments has profited by a virus hoax they bought a lot of vaccines and now they are giving it to the public or else the spending was for nothing so the big bosses in corporations and governments tell their employees to push this agenda and the employees go along with it.</p>
<p>But to push a vaccine you need a fake virus so they created a fake and to create a fake virus you need to fund the media big money for fear and push new laws so you have to listen to people like Fauci, Tedros, Gates, Biden, Clinton, Hollywood Celebrities and many more rich politicians/celebrities/investors/bankers etc .</p>
<p>While the middle class and low class are fighting for freedom and fight to get their jobs back, the higher classes are pushing the lies to give excuses this is all okay and this is all for our safety.</p>
<p>While the middle and low class is being suppressed some of them fall for the lies and might join the corporations/Government side to help push the agenda while also a lot of them tries to get back to normal</p>
<p>The governments and corporations keeps going to profit from a virus hoax and takes away all middle class and lower class freedom all for safety but it's not actually safety because they make people feel suicidal and when people are in state of fear or are feeling suicidal they are easier to control but also easier to get mad.</p>
<p>This won't stop until the majority of the low class and middle class stand up against corporations and governments.</p>
<p>But that's exactly what government want a revolution that way they have a excuse to make vaccination mandatory and they will keep going till the divide becomes so big it starts a civil war. </p>
<p>They create laws but don't have to follow all this laws it's a rich man's paradise while they make it harder for the middle class and lower class to live.</p></p>
