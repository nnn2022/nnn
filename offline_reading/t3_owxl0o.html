    <strong>I feel like a cornered animal</strong>
    <p><p>I'm at a point where the level of frustration I'm feeling with the current situation is so overwhelming, and the lack of an endgame so glaring, it's making me physically sick with rage. I live in Ontario, Canada, and we suffered through one of the longest-running restriction regimes in the world. Unlike the US and UK, we didn't get a breather. Now, just as we move through to the last phase of the bullshit not-really-reopening, they are beginning to talk of new lockdowns this fall. This is so patently absurd, I'm totally <em>floored</em> that they even dare utter the suggestion.</p>
<p>I fully expect they will collapse the economy to depths that make the Great Depression look like a cakewalk. The money printer has been pegged for the last 18 months, government debt is exploding. How long before we have hyperinflation? I think a new lockdown after people have been vaccinated in massive numbers will do it. Confidence will be lost completely. Millions more will be impoverished and lose everything, in Canada and around the world. The suffering inflicted on children is probably what makes me the most angry. The level of selfishness it must take to unapologetically steal their futures is absolutely fucking shocking.</p>
<p>Lots of people would say it's out of our hands, that it's the virus, but it's not. PEOPLE are doing this, it's not the fucking virus, it's PEOPLE. It's us and our government. We can choose to approach this in a way that minimizes harm without destroying our society. That's not what's happening, and I can't understand why. What the fuck is wrong with this fucking society? Worst of all, I seem to be one of the few who has this attitude around here. Most are docile, masked all the time, completely brainwashed by their curated Facebook news feeds, incapable of considering (let alone producing) an independent thought. They think covid is the black death and the government is justified in their actions. They will never resist.</p>
<p>I've grown to truly despise the way society works here in the past year and I just need to get out. I'm able to go to the US, as I have attained citizenship there years ago. I was thinking of going to Florida, but it's a huge leap of faith, and it would require completely uprooting and leaving behind relationships. I don't know where to go there, don't know about job prospects, and not sure it will remain free in the long run. Don't know what else can be done though, because Canada is lost. I don't see any spirit here and just need to get out. I feel like I'm suffocating under the weight of this incessant stream of fucking bullshit. All I see is shrugs and apathy when they are fucking enslaving us all. There are people on here and other places who understand but not many in real life do. They have a completely different outlook on life. I need to be somewhere with more like-minded people. It's clear the shitshow is going to go on for years or even decades. Life is too short to spend it in a shithole like this.</p>
<p>Anyway, I just needed to get that off my chest. Scrolling through the news this evening got me really worked up. Things look very bleak and I'm fucking pissed.</p></p>

        <p>We’re going to find a way to get out of this mess, and if there’s one thing I know for sure is that we’re not going down without a fight. Guess what? We made it this far without getting completely brainwashed and without getting some weird shit injected into us for no reason. We’ve been able to see through the propaganda, and started questioning things and looking for answers. </p>
<p>I know all of this is overwhelming and seems completely hopeless, and I let it get to me too. When things get too big, it’s best to go small. But it’s always darkest right before dawn right? And look at the way they are scrambling now, panicking and doubling down on their fear tactics. Why? Because they know that there are many of us out there and we’re not scared, and that scares them. That’s why there’s such a push to divide us and make us feel isolated, makes it easier to manipulate and control. </p>
<p>The way I see it, there are only two choices right now - stand up for what you believe in or bend over and be a slave. There’s nothing in between. I’m not bending over, and neither should you. Especially now. Hold strong, you’re more powerful than you think.</p>

        <p>I’m from Quebec but have been living in Japan for the past seven years and it’s shocking what Canada has turned into. I honestly can’t believe the level of brain-washing there; people have entirely lost their critical thinking skills. Mine and my husband’s family and most people we know there are consistently eating up the propaganda. It’s really hard to talk to anyone we know there now and it makes us despair. Sorry you have to deal with this stuff on a day-to-day basis. I can’t imagine how soul-crushing and disheartening it must feel. I’d be fucking RUNNING to Florida.</p>

        <p>Yes, it's remarkable how the general public operates here. I don't think a country can remain rich and prosperous with widespread attitudes like this. It's not going to be free anymore, certainly. We're just riding on the coattails of our grandparents while running it all into the ground. Lessons from history weren't learned.</p>
<p>I think I will run to Florida. Texas and Tennessee are also on my radar. This will be a big change with lots of unknowns but it looks like it's the better option long-term. It's not even that drastic. I think of the way people leave their countries to go somewhere without even knowing the language (did you know Japanese before?). Sometimes they even go without proper documents. This will be nothing like that, the risk is much lower, and I'm already a citizen there. It's just something I will have to do, and I'll probably be happy I did it. I like the idea of living in a warmer climate by the ocean as well.</p>

        <p>Yes, absolutely! That’s all awesome to hear. 💪 Living in a warmer climate by the sea has always been a dream of mine. If I stay in Japan longterm I’ll probably move to a seaside town at some point. </p>
<p>And yeah, I didn’t know much Japanese before moving here other than the very basics like attempting to order food in a restaurant, lol. </p>
<p>Up and leaving a country might sound overwhelming as hell but I really do think you’ll ultimately feel a lot safer and happier in any of those states. ‘Exit strategies’ during this fucking mess are so important. Things in Japan seem pretty okay for me right now as I’d be shocked if the government tried to mandate vaccines but you never know. I’m constantly thinking of back-up plans if that were to happen or where I’d potentially up and leave to next.</p>
<p>We’ve gotta do what we can now to survive if things get real scary. You can definitely do this. 💪</p>

        <p>How’s life in Japan? Last time I checked you were only 3% vaccinated which sounded positive but I also read the government plans to vaccinate everybody till the end of the year. How’s the culture shock of moving there “from the west”? Lastly, how big’s the threat posed by China?</p>

        <p>Hi! Things in Japan have been good and I’m really grateful to be here. A lot of Japanese people are scared of these vaccines and don’t want them. I’d be really, really shocked if the government tried to mandate the vaccines here. They’re barely able to do anything during the states of emergency due to the insane levels of bureaucracy (a good thing!) — life has not been entirely different here during COVID other than me being able to work from home. </p>
<p>I didn’t experience much culture shock when I moved here but that might’ve been because I’d watched so many TV shows, movies and anime so I kind of knew what to expect (I’d also visited prior to moving here). As for the threat from China, I don’t hear much about it and I’ve been here for nearly eight years. You used to hear a lot about NK but now you don’t hear much about either. It isn’t really anything I’ve thought about too much while being here. Things generally feel pretty okay/safe on a day-to-day basis.</p>

        <p>I appreciate it. The biggest trouble I'm having right now is deciding which area to move to. I would need to at least have an idea of where I'm going in order to start job hunting. If they live in a good area or know which places are good bets, that would be very helpful.</p>
