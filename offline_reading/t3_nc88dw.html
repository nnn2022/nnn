        <p>There's a difference between saying "you can't verify that" and claiming "that is true or untrue." If the final destination of money from a charity is different than claimed, that doesn't make everyone who donates a liar. </p>
<p>The distinction is that trusting an authority is an act of faith, that the chain of intention between the master and subordinate is unmediated and authentic.</p>
<p>Large control structures do not have a good track record of transparent communication, because the people at the bottom become invisible to the people at the top, and vice versa. Everyone is "in on it" for as long as they obey their immediate authority without considering the full chain of command.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.euromomo.eu/">I</a>'m not saying that everyone who contributes to these statistics is in on it. What i am saying is that people who are in on it manipulate these statistics according to  kweniston. Now how would you know that? Why would you think that? It's very convenient to say everyone who shows a different picture than what you think is a liar. Where does the lie end? What are the consequences then? If people who develop PCR tests lie about it, what else do they lie about? How much of the field of microbiology is a lie? RT-qPCRs are used in many studies, are they all a lie? Are only the scientists who work on SARS-Cov-2 lying? Kweniston seems to indicate a global conspiracy. That would imply that a lot of scientist are lying. Do they only lie about SARS-Cov-2? That wouldn't make much sense. Kweniston does think mass spectrometry is a valid method, why? So the science behind that one is valid, but not behind PCR tests? Why? It seems to me that kweniston simply sais that anyone who opposes his narrative is a liar, without proof. Kweniston sais that PCR tests are not reliable because Mullis said so. So why belief Mullis and not scientists who say otherwise? That's a call to authority fallacy, on which he bases his argument for lying. It doesn't add up in my eyes. Where does the global conspiracy end?</p>

        <p>I think conspiracy types are throwing wild claims out there because something makes them anxious and they can't disprove it themselves. Many are outcasts of the dominant structure in some way and have a greater capacity to criticize it. They have already lost trust in that structure and seek alternate viewpoints on any issue.</p>
<p>Plus there is the memetic power of a claim attacking something once held for granted. The idea is that if it can't be outright reflected, there's something in it to explore.</p>
<p>It's not necessarily that "this is true for sure," it's more of a "shine a spotlight here until it can be fully dismissed or not." If it doesn't go away, maybe that's because the proof against it was not air-tight. Conspirasists try to poke holes in narratives (irony) and provoke in order to test logic.</p>
<p>The larger point about a global conspiracy is maybe "look at tech, look at money, look at power consolidation, look at controlled information, can we trust it?" It's hard to distinguish blame because it's the meta of an authority and its subjects that enacts the power. Many people trust their authority irrationally if they feel rewarded by it.</p>
<p>A cherry-picking king is more dangerous than a cherry-picking servant.</p>
<p>I think these types of thoughts are an important part of keeping modern narrative in check, as you are doing by applying conspiracy logic to conspiracy.</p>

        <p>I find it very worrying that these echo chambers are growing. No-one in there confronts them with the implications of their own lies. They repeat them so much that they accept them as truth. This misinformation hurts people, it has real world consequences.</p>
