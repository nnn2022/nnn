    <strong>I refuse to get the vaccine.</strong>
    <p><p>Hello everyone. I am an older fellow, and I had a heart attack on February 26 2020.  After the past year and a half, I am trying to not to lose it. My (so called) friends no longer associate with me. My in-laws are now acting weird. I don't want to get vaccinated after hearing about the heart problems. I just don't want to risk it. My doctor of course says I should do it, but I refuse. Why would they refuse to hear my side? </p>
<p>Doctor's, in-laws, and friends are all against me. It's really messing me up.</p>
<p>Thanks for letting me rant.</p></p>

        <p>Good to hear your reasons.  For every person refusing to get the vaccine, there is an individual set of reasons.  They will try to paint you as crazy, but you are far from alone.  We all have our reasons, and they are all just as valid as the next.  It's your life, your body, and you have a God given right to choose as a free man to do what you will.</p>

        <p>Ignore the idiots, remember</p>
<p>You can file charges against the source of the vx under the 5th... The gov saying you can't is a massive red flag.</p>
<p>The dems who fled texas to stop honest elections are vaxed... yet all have covid? Why get a vax that has risks and doesn't work.</p>
<p>If masks worked (like they claimed) why are we still dealing with covid...</p>
<p>If social distancing worked (like they claimed) why are we still dealing with covid...</p>
<p>Ask your friends some fun questions and then ask, are you so stupid you cannot use the data you see first hand, maybe I don't need you dip shits in my life.</p>
<p>If sunlight doesn't kill covid, why do mask less people letting sunlight reach their face have no covid issues (see Florida, Switzerland and any other non mask areas covid infection rates)</p>
<p>The problem is they know they have been fooled and are too prideful to admit it, they listen to fox and ccn and shit.</p>

        <p>Hmm not to derail your comment but the Florida and Switzerland thing got me thinking. If anyone prob needs more vitamin D it would be in Switzerland, yet they are doing better than places near the equator. </p>

        <p>The social shunning is coming down hard, but stay strong in your conviction. My husband is refusing for similar reasons as he’s had many heart issues going back to his youth, and Ive even have a family member disabled from strokes caused by the vaccine. The gaslighting that’s happening right now is real. I’m with you OP.</p>

        <p>Hi new friend! Since I was little I never cared about an age difference w my friends so welcome 🙏 </p>
<p>I’m 42 btw with high blood pressure, my mom has been on BP meds for 20 years and now my dad is as well and had a micro stroke sometime in the last year. Last thing I need is a clot shot. So aside from the moral objections, I can relate!</p>

        <p>Why would they refuse to hear your side? Because the sheer amount of programming has become more prevalent in their minds than their care for your thoughts, emotions, opinions, and overall welfare. It's tough to think about it like that but there's really no other explanation. Propagate something enough, it becomes the first reaction.</p>
<p>Or think of it this way - if they listened to your side because they love you, and you explained your concerns also out of a place of love and communication, they'd be forced to realize you're reasonable. And if there are reasonable concerns about the vaccine then they're forced to realize what they themselves are complicit in. So they can't hear it  at all to start with.</p>
<p>You weighed the risks and benefits and decided against it, and that needs to be end of story! For us all!</p>
