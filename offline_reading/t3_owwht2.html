    <strong>Desperately Needing Help from this Sub</strong>
    <p><p>Hi Everyone,
First of all, thank you so much for all of your efforts in combating the, “new normal" (I am using a throwaway for privacy reasons). I have been on edge with severe anxiety and have not been able to sleep for the past few weeks after seeing more and more reports of municipalities, states, and even the federal government boasting talks of vaccine mandates.</p>
<p>Here is where it gets tricky. My line of work is in health research (policy, biostatistics, epidemiology, etc.) which means the organization is hyper vigilant about their employees having the vaccine. It has not been mandated yet, but for the past month they have been sending out automated emails, “requiring” us to report our vaccination status. I chose to ignore the emails, and nothing more has been said about it. With all the media buzz and pressure to enforce vaccine mandates, I cannot help but feel like the conversation will be imminent. </p>
<p>As mentioned previously, I know the personal and scientific reasons as to why the vaccine is not an option for my family, but I believe it would be unwise to unload that sentiment on any superiors if questioned. I cannot sleep at night thinking about all of the different scenarios on how it would potentially play out in real life. This is an issue so personal I do not believe I could maintain composure and find the right words when I need them. What hurts the most is I am working at an organization I love in a meaningful job. The organization is great for the most part and I enjoy what I do for the first time in my life in regard to a career. I worked tremendously hard and sacrificed a great deal of my life to get in the position I am in today which makes the situation much more difficult.</p>
<p>Now that part has been said, I do not know where to go from here. I just started my life in a new state for this job and bought my first ever house which I invested a lot of time and resources in with the intention of making it my forever home. I know if my workplace decided to let me go due to refusing the vaccine, my savings would only last so long. In terms of finding another job, it will likely be difficult to find an opening in a health research setting (or otherwise) that would be willing to hire someone without a vaccine. </p>
<p>I am so worried about my future and the life I built getting taken away because of a choice I wholeheartedly disagree with both scientifically and philosophically. I have been trying to think of backup plans and what my family will do if we lose our jobs and cannot find anything else as acquiescing to the vaccine will never be an option for us.</p>
<p>Any help, constructive ideas, recommendations, advice, or anything useful would be extremely appreciated as I feel like my back is against the wall and there is nothing I can do to stop the madness. </p>
<p>Cheers</p></p>

        <p>16 It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads, 17 so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name.</p>

<p>Given where the future is headed, I'm not surprised by anything anymore.  Not even by Americans who give their fellow citizens no options but to move to another state.  At least Biden hasn't mandated anything yet.</p>
<p>All that said, I'm blessed to work in an industry where my job isn't in jeopardy for refusing the vaccine.  I'm sorry about your situation.  Maybe this is a solid reminder that homes, jobs, and all of the things related to them are temporary and can be pulled away at any moment.</p>
<p>I wouldn't worry about the future in regards to this unless something actually happens/changes at your job.  Lots of people are quitting their jobs due to forced mandates and it's dividing America more and more.  I still think there will be two sides for awhile and it will be possible to find jobs on the other side.  Some industries might be harder to find jobs in but I think that knowledge can carry over into other industries too, can it not?  Seems like research and the study of biology would be highly desirable skills regardless of the particular job.</p>

        <p>Those are some good points. I needed some rational thoughts like this to calm me down from my mind going crazy over all this. Luckily, I have a pretty diverse background and education beyond health care but its still a frightening thought to lose everything over refusing a vaccine. Just wanted to acknowledge I truly understand and empathize with everyone who has lost way more due to this, "pandemic". I am not saying, "oh poor pitiful me" as I am very fortunate to still have a job, but am still understandably upset given the circumstances.</p>

        <p>AS difficult as it is, I am making preparations to leave my forever home behind.  And it is a beautiful home and I love it.  I can't imagine what it will feel like when I drive away from it for the last time.  It will be horrible.  But, I think of what happened to Cuba.  You could leave for a time, until you couldn't anymore and.... that's held for the past 62 years.  Look at those who left everything behind and fled: they got to live their lives with freedom.  Eventually those who stayed had everything taken from them anyways.</p>

        <p>That is true. The state I moved to seemed to not play all the COVID games as much as most of the other red states which played a factor into moving here. However, our governor has been flip-flopping a lot on COVID which has me uneasy and may make moving to another state a reality.</p>

        <p>That is how I am feeling right now too. The state I moved to is relatively red, but the, "Republican" governor is incredibly vague and ambiguous with his language. Our state has a huge deficit in federal funding vs. money we bring in so I have no faith in state leaders to do anything as they are likely under Washington's spell when it comes to financial relief.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry your having sleepless nights, but I feel like we may just have to find our own society. We can not live under tyranny. If they keep threatening and harassing and controlling, we may have to go our separate ways. It’s not us that causing problems, they can’t coexist. They are lunatics. I hope others can give more practical advice. It’s better to be healthy and alive, then sick or dead.</p>

        <p>I wish that was a possibility. One thing I know for sure and that gives me hope is that there are way more rational, compassionate, and ethical people who regard personal liberties and freedoms than there are on the other side. The media warps people's perception of how many individuals actually agree with COVID restrictions, vaccines, etc. In real life, the numbers staggeringly work in our favor.</p>

        <p>This is wonderful. The harsh rigors of adulthood are forcing you to present the praxis to your NNN stance and live out your “personal” and “scientific” reasons for refusing to be vaccinated. </p>
<p>You can no longer LARP with the rest of the idiots on here as a patriotic renegade who refuses to kiss the boot. Now you must (literally) put your money where your mouth is. </p>
<p>A chance to continue building the future you want for yourself and your family; or unemployment and abject misery in the name of feckless protest? </p>
<p>Now of course, if your rationalizations for your refusal to be inoculated we’re deeply held convictions, this wouldn’t even be a decision to make. You’d stoutly and unwaveringly tell them your choice and live in peace with the fact that you didn’t cower to the fascists (lol) regardless of the consequences.</p>
<p>Instead the voice of reason rings, naggingly, in your subconscious. It underscores each conception you have about Covid and the vaccines with a tenor of doubt; begging you to reconsider your stance. My advice: you should embrace it and listen closer. After all, what do you have to lose…. besides everything?</p>

        <p>LARP: Live Action Role-Playing. </p>
<p>If there’s no circumstance under which you’ll consider getting the vaccine then what’s the point of your post? What “help” do you hope to receive? </p>
<p>There is no breakaway society of anti-vaxxers and Covid-deniers to run to for asylum. </p>
<p>There is no country/government that is going to sacrifice the wellbeing of its entire population to placate the desires of those who want to perpetuate the delusion that Covid is a hoax. </p>
<p>So if your convictions about the vaccine were not just shallow platitudes borne of ignorance, and misinformation then you wouldn’t even question yourself. You’d tell your employer to shove it and you’d walk.</p>
