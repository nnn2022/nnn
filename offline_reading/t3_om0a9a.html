    <strong>the “new world order” has finally made its way into my life</strong>
    <p><p>This COVID world order really didn’t start to affect my life until very recently. As I’m sure y’all know, California is HIGHLY blue-pilled with most of the issues regarding COVID. Long ago, I stopped wearing a face mask and giving a shit about any of these rules minus my job, which obviously still required me to wear a mask. A couple weeks ago,  I had gotten word that my store director was not going to be in forcing people to wear masks, vaccinated or unvaccinated. He wanted to just give everyone (particularly the employees) a break from all this shit, and that we can finally start to return to normalcy.</p>
<p>Of course, that didn’t last long.</p>
<p>Every business has that one asshole manager, and ours (who we refer to as the White Knight) along with another useless asshole we work with got a hold of a list of people who were and were not vaccinated, and called the emergency HR hotline, reporting that there were unvaccinated employees working without face masks. This was done while our store director was on vacations, so then the white knight was given power by HR to enforce masks by all means. Not only was this particular manager asking about some employees’ vaccination statuses behind their backs, but he was also directly asking people about it (like myself, who is not vaccinated).</p>
<p>Some people just want to keep this paranoia shit going. It gives them something to freak out over, something to invest their pathetic lives into, at the cost of peace for people who just want to do their jobs and move on with their lives.</p>
<p>One of the managers at my job happens to be a good friend of mine, who also put in the hiring word for me. Not only is he pretty blue-pulled on most all social issues, but he knows I’m not vaccinated. Last night, he texted me a big paragraph saying that he understands my frustration with everything, but he doesn’t want my actions putting his job and long-time reputation at risk, since my actions reflect on him one way or another. Not only that, but he claims that the business  is allowed to ask for proof of vaccination (which i think is complete bullshit). He tells me that I need to keep wearing a face mask on the job, and that he doesn’t want to publicly look like he’s “taking it easy on anybody” just because we’re friends.</p>
<p>Obviously I value my friendship with this guy (and paying my bills), and for the sake of the position he’s in, I told him I would wear a face mask.</p>
<p>I just can’t believe it’s gotten to this point. Unfortunately looking for other work anywhere else down here in Southern California is hard already, especially businesses who aren’t giving into this whole Covid crap. It’s just disheartening and the fact that it’s now affecting my personal relationships just SUCKS man.</p></p>

        <p>I lied to everyone and said I got vaxxed. Me and my health is #1 and nobody at my work is gonna visit me in the hospital or pay my bills if something happens. Why should I put myself in danger for a place that would replace me in 2 weeks. </p>
<p>If the choice is to adopt the ancient art of skulduggery or get a weirdo shot that could kill me down the line, sorry but imma lie cuz fuck you.</p>

        <p>Wear it under your nose. Poke some holes in it discreetly. 
Seriously, make sure to replace it often. Supposed to be replaced every hour or so of continued use or it becomes a bacteria cesspool. </p>
<p>Could you cut a deal and have the manager provide plenty of masks?</p>

        <p>Anti Great Reset, anti new world order, anti world economic forum group(Great Unplugging)</p>
<p>A group called the Great Unplugging created a great plan against the nwo. The founder is very aware of, davos, world economic forum and more. </p>
<p>The founder had a idea where we make our infrastructure by all of us donating infrastructure we desire and buy the products from our own infrastructure. Instead of relying and buying things that would support the big business that are part of the new world order. Like IPhones or more. </p>
<p>If you guys think this a controlled opposition or a honeypot trap. You guys can figure that out by going to our discord and ask us about it. Rather then say we are without any evidence to it. Also we don’t have a leader we have a founder. There is no big figure/leader type person. We are more of a people’s group with an idea.</p>
<p>I don’t know how to explain this fully but there’s a discord where you can talk to the owner about it. But there will be a website soon. We have created a alternate face book. All links below.</p>
<p>Ask any questions below I’ll try to answer too </p>
