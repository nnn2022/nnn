    <strong>Academic research</strong>
    <p><p>Hello!</p>
<p>My name is Hannah, and I am currently studying for a social science master’s degree at a British university.  I have been in touch with your moderators and gained permission to post a survey that I have produced for my dissertation.</p>
<p>My dissertation looks to present the different levels of resistance to the British COVID-19 restrictions. My aim is to present the perspective counter to the dominant narrative in order to shed light on opinions that are often aggressively dismissed by the general populous. </p>
<p>This survey looks to gather opinions and reflections regarding the UK governments COVID social restrictions. This being said, I am keen to hear the experiences and opinions of those in different countries and with different levels of restrictions. I’d like my dissertation to be able to candidly gather the experiences and opinions of those who are sceptical of or opposed to the dominant narrative and handling of the coronavirus pandemic, without the prejudice. </p>
<p>All responses to this survey are anonymous unless explicitly requested and agreed with the individual, as with all interactions that will feature in my research.</p>
<p>If you are interested and happy to fill it out, please follow the attached link. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to either comment on this post or message me directly.</p>

<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Hannah.</p></p>

        <p>Uh for me not participating in the profit driven, dangerous and experimental Big Pharmaceutical industry is a lifelong choice after watching it literally destroy the lives of my family members and having spent the past 20+ years researching it in all of my free time. There is nothing I would not lose to NOT be a part of this "new chapter" in mRNA genetic therapeutics... Trying to convince people who have seen straight through to the truth of the Utter Depravity of the Industry to now partake in it, would be similar to trying to mandate that vegans must eat meat.. etc.... (I'm def not a vegan but making a point). Never going to happen. This is the hill I die on. Sad that I live in a world this idiotic .<br>
In NO way does everyone giving in to experimental injections now open the door to more freedom later.. Instead, it opens the door to corporations looking to mandate any and every "vaccine" or new genetic therapy under the sun so they can maximize profits as much as possible forevermore. We are literally standing at the gateway to Hell. The only way to not be forced down this authoritarian totalitarian path is to NEVER be forced into mandatory injections of experimental agents.. In the name of freedom? PLEASE, that is ridiculous and barely scratches the surface of what is actually happening. By giving into Big Pharma now, you are signaling your willingness to sacrifice yours and everyones medical freedom from now on going forward.</p>
