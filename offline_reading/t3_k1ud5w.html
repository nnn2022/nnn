    <strong>Therapeutics questions</strong>
    <p><p>Does anyone know what therapeutics they are using for patients with covid prior to ventilation? I know in my state,  the drugs Trump had suggested early on are banned for use for covid. Is covid-19 resistant to steroids? Trump took dexamethasone(with other treatments, i believe).I know people that have had it and recovered at home, a couple of them were prescribed albuterol inhalers and  benzonatate (pill for dry cough). I've been on dexamethasone and prednisone for respiratory illness before.
I haven't heard much about any other therapeutics they are using on hospitalized covid patients. Does anyone here have any experience or knowledge?</p></p>

        <p>Im in a college town where a ton of people have had it including myself. Since most ppl my age group get over it pretty easily and dont usually need to go to the doctor, this might not be the most helpful. Most of us took nothing or just over the counter cold medicine. I did have one friend who has pretty bad asthma and was hit a little harder so she went to the doctor and they gave her steroids to strengthen her lungs. Don't know what they were called but they seemed to do the trick and that might be specific to her case since she had asthma. I don't really think there's a standard go too medicine, just the same stuff you'd give for other respitory illnesses. Might be more of a standard for severe hospitalized patients, but nobody I know has gotten that bad.</p>
