    <strong>COVID education and game theory</strong>
    <p><p>People protesting loudly that schools should not open will likely cause schools to actually not open. I presume that many of these people actually have young children and are semi-aware that their kid will be a little bit worse off than if they had attended school in person. They know that while they're at work, their kid will be at grandma's house with an iPad—who knows if they're learning anything. I don't think they realize that other parents will absolutely not let their kids lose ground and will "cheat" by finding alternative ways to give them a superior education.</p>
<p>Many of my techy friends with kids are a) working from home and b) perfectly capable of teaching their kids everything up to advanced math. They're also probably going to teach them programming, giving them an early head start. The kids of this relatively small group of people might even get a <em>better</em> education than if they had attended school in person. The gulf that will open up between these kids and the regular American kids will be MASSIVE after a full year. Sadly, it will probably be very clear who who took 2nd grade online in 10 years :(.</p>
<p>Do the people pushing for schools to close have any idea how fucked their kids will be after a year of home schooling? On the global scale, many countries already have in person instruction. America is already far behind in terms of education. The absolute last thing we need is a year of online instruction.</p></p>

        <p>Interesting thought!!!!
Yet another example of the inequality stemming from the lockdowns. The left wing would ordinarily be so concerned about this. The silence is deafening.</p>

        <p>Once you understand that this is a controlled demolition, it will make more sense. Of course they know how fucked up it's going to make the kids. That's why they're doing it.</p>

        <p>I am a high schooler. I've been out of school since March. I started my new semester online. I hate it. I dont like school, but it sure does feel nice being outside and hanging out with your friends. But it sure doesnt help that one of those friends of yours is accustomed to consumer culture that they don't wanna go to school during the most important years of their lives that'll help build the foundation for their future. Instead, they just want to pretend to be sweet "introverts who hate the outside world" when instead it's just a pathetic excuse to be a more lazy person.</p>

        <p>I disagree with you. Do you have kids? I do and I’m a former teacher. You’re underestimating how hard it is to schedule and teach at home, even with the smartest parents and most compliant kids. All kids are going to be behind this year. There will be an education gap between the haves and the have-nots, as there always is, but it will be shifted to where everyone is learning less effectively.</p>

        <p>I was homeschooled until my junior year of high school when I went to the local community college. It was super easy to tell who the homeschooled PSEO kids were compared to the public school kids with two extra years of high school done. It's ridiculous how much an effect <em>not</em> being around the sex, drugs, alcohol and general degeneracy in public schools will have on a kid.</p>

        <p>Yeah, but it's not like everyone will be homeschooling their own kids.  People will group together and share the burden.  We'll essentially see a bunch of mini-private schools.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/07/28/parents-working-home-due-coronavirus-work-home-requirements-has-parents-pooling-resources-hire-tutor/5498620002/">Just the first link I found on home school pods.</a></p>
<p>It's a little ironic that the same groups who are demanding remote learning will now yell about the inequity of the privatization of remote learning, but it was an obvious outcome to anyone who looked more than one step into the future.  I've been telling my teacher friends to be careful about hoping for remote learning for another semester because this pandemic could really dramatically alter the educational landscape.  It's pretty clear (I think) that remote learning through the public educational system wasn't a great success.  Admittedly, they had to adapt on the fly which couldn't have been easy, but I haven't been hearing much in the way of new approaches going into the fall.  PS - I'm not an advocate of either position and I'm not affected either way; I'm just sharing my opinion of what I think will happen.</p>

        <p>Homeschooling is hard.  I know because I was homeschooled and I'm homeschooling my kids.  It seems so unfair to force homeschooling on people who never wanted it, aren't equipped for it, and can't afford it.</p>
<p>Homeschooling doesn't work well for everyone.   All the people pushing school closure can afford private tutors or time off work.  They don't seem to spare a thought for the working-class parents who are struggling just to make ends meet.</p>

        <p>The education system is shit anyway, that's part of why we're currently in this mess. I understand that working parents need affordable babysitting, but that's all public school really is, not the valuable education people seem to think it is. Really, what exactly are children falling behind on? Authoritarian propaganda and collectivist conditioning, courtesy of Daddy Government and Mommy Megacorporation? It's not like the education system cares about teaching history or science. If students return to class, they're just plunked into the next evolution of the school-to-prison pipeline: jail school.</p>
