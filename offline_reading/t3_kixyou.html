    <strong>For when a doomer mentions New Zealand</strong>
    <p><p>This has been annoying the hell out of me for awhile. That "if only we complied with the science we could be just like New Zealand". Here's why we can't</p>
<ul>
<li>New Zealand has only \~750 daily flights domestic and international (\~267,000 yearly). The United States has \~87,000 flights daily (\~31 million yearly). With that much traffic in, out, and around the country, it's going to spread. And since New Zealand is so isolated, it's never really going to get there</li>
<li>New Zealand only has 5 airports that regularly offer international flights, which illuminates its isolation.</li>
<li>the United States has 10 metropolitan areas with a higher population than ALL of New Zealand (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, DC, Philadelphia, Miami, Atlanta, Boston and San Francisco). When people are that tightly packed in, I'm sorry, IT'S GOING TO SPREAD</li>
<li>New Zealand's most populous met area (Auckland) would be the 40th most populous met area in the United States. So even if the virus does end up in NZ, it's not really going to spread since they're  relatively spread apart.</li>
</ul>
<p>So no, NZ "defeating" covid wasn't because of mask-wearing, or even government competence. It was because they're a fucking island nation with a population half that of New Jersey</p></p>

        <p>This. Their low population density combined with isolated location and ability to basically stop all incoming travel and movement was key there. Not sustainable whatsoever unless they want to stay sealed off from the world forever. Seeing as tourism and media are two major industries there, they really can’t.</p>
<p>I’m sick of NZ being a success story because they’re not. Taking away rights with incredibly strict lockdowns and not letting your citizens leave the country is not a success in the least.</p>

        <p>The virus had been spreading since December, possibly earlier. So by the time the world panicked in March there was literally nothing that could be done in global hubs like the US and UK. Since hardly anyone went to NZ in those months they didn’t have the spread.</p>

        <p>Im sure there was probably a non confirmed case prior to the 1st documented case on Feb 24th but it wouldnt have been many. Health officials in NZ were aware of the virus by Dec-Jan and were already on the look out for suspected cases. Any sort of flu like symptoms would have been flagged as that would've been unusual in our summer. If it was rife and burning through the populace the symptomatic cases would have presented but they didnt.</p>

        <p>Really because everyone I hear from down there says you can’t go anywhere other than the possible bubble with Australia (last I heard). Maybe I’m thinking of Oz but either way you don’t have people coming in at all and doubtful that people are going out at any significant rate either. </p>
<p>Your lockdowns didn’t “work”, your low population density and isolation from the rest of the world just naturally led to that. As far as people being upset, it’s a bit different coming from a country that was not founded on rights and freedom. At one point your govt was threatening to put people in quarantine facilities upon testing positive. I’d rather not live in a country that would consider doing this. You are in a situation where whenever one case pops up your government will freak out and lock everything and everyone down completely-that’s not something to be proud of and isn’t a sustainable solution. What will you do when the world opens again and travelers bring it there inevitably? Because it will happen, you can’t stay isolated forever</p>

        <p>You're thinking of Aussie. You have to apply for exemption to leave.
 The lockdown did eradicate the virus along with the flu this year. Action was still required. The Spanish Flu got here in 1919 and wiped out heaps of people with a much much lower population and without air travel. 
There have been several outbreaks because the virus is very invasive but beyond the coolstore one where only Auckland went to level 3 for 17 days the other outbreaks have been contained without a change in alert level due to an effectice contract tracing system. It's also easy when ypu only have one outbreak at a time too.
  As far as individual freedoms goes, the virus doesnt really give a fuck. New Zealand is living large because we worked together. Does that mean that other countries could have done the same? No. Different situations but one of the reasons that this is still going on because people dont want to work together collectively for a greater good. Fuck governments. You do need them to tell people to do the right thing but not doing the right thing just helps the virus carrying on.</p>

        <p>Very true. New Zealand’s population is around 4 million, close to half of New York City’s. There largest city Auckland which is around 1.4 million people. They didn’t have very many cases to begin with and because of their advantage of being isolated, they can close their borders and realistically come close to having near zero covid. Unfortunately for them, they rely on tourism and isolation will hurt them in the long run. Couldn’t be done in the US since we have multiple densely populated cities that surpass the population of New Zealand. Atlanta and it’s surrounding suburbs alone have a population close to that of all of new zeland.</p>

        <p>Tourism is 5.8% of GDP in NZ and a major employer so yes it is a big hit but Kiwis are big travelleres to and with most everyone choosing to stay home this year the billions that that would normally go overseas are staying in the country. The 2nd quarter that included the lockdown were bad with a -12% drop in GDP but the 3rd quarter results were up +13% and no Covid and zero restrictions meant the economy is as free as it can be. Unemployment was lower than expected and business confidence is higher than it was than in 2019. With vaccines rolling out and Aussie (our biggest tourism partner) there is hope that by mid to late '21 the borders will be fully open again.</p>

<p>If they did forced, mass testing on healthy people like in the US and EU they would suddenly find a massive "outbreak"</p>

        <p>Dec-Mar is summer and the main tourists season which sees about 4m visitors(mostly from Aussie, europe  US and china) Only one had to bring it into the country so actual numbers of flights or airports is irrelevant. While population density is a thing so is the urbanisation rate which in NZ is higher than the US and the UK. More people live in urban areas where a virus can spread easily. We dont all live on remote farms. The 1st key to success was locking down so early. It went into lockdown with only 200 cases in the country. The 2nd key was closing the borders. Both of these were big calls which other countries at the time were unwilling to make. Using things like geography to one's advantage is a smart thing, right? People shouldnt get too upset with NZ's success if their country didnt have the same advantages but should defintely be upset with their own country for not doing things that would have helped in them. Half measures and chopping and changing has not helped elsewhere and has only prolonged this thing.</p>
<p>Also, masks were never a thing in NZ and there has never been a country wide mask mandate and very few people wore them. There is now a requirement to wear them on public transport but only in Auckland and that is because it's harder to contact trace public transport.</p>

        <p>lol you are actually stupid. </p>
<p>you claim that the higher numbers are due to the larger metropolitan areas “cramming” more people in. the USA is still ~~geographically~~ demographically far more spread out than NZ, yet has <em>12,000x</em> the number of cases.</p>

        <p>Only 6% of the land in the United States is lived on. 80% of the US population lives in urban areas. Land mass doesn’t matter. Popular dispersal does. All I ask is that you think critically for a split second before commenting. Hope this helps.</p>
