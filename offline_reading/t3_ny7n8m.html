        <p>&rt;While AstraZeneca’s vaccine showed in studies that it was almost 100% effective in protecting death from most Covid-19 variants, its efficacy against mild and moderate illness from the beta variant, first identified in South Africa, was just 22%. That mutation has been found in Seychelles.</p>
<p>There's your culprit: the mutations. Vaccinated people are prone to infection of variants. Already in april, the university of Tel Aviv did a study on 800 people, 400 vaxxed (Pfizer) and 400 nonvaxxed. Conclusions were that nonvaxxed did get significantly more infections, but more importantly, vaxxed people showed an 8-fold infection rate with mutation (in this case also the SA mvariant). It seems the vaccinations make people prone to get infected with mutation, because these variants are actually adptations to the vaccine induced antibodies.</p>
<p>Similar scenario in the UK, having a highly vaccinated (AZ) population, 60%-70% of infections with Indian delta variant are breakthrough infections with vaccinated people (as per case reporting of Dr McCullough).</p>
<p>The idea of viral environmental adaptation through immune escape is not new, as the WHO was warned for this scenario by vaccine specialist Geert Vanden Bossche in March. This is now researched as <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.23.21257679v1.full">overrepresentation of mutations with vaccinated people</a> are showing up. Although more research is needed, this overrepresentation indicates 2 obvious scenarios. (1) Vaccinated people being more susceptible to be infected with variants, which would indicate these subjects immune system is compromised (resulting in necessity of revised booster shots to prevent possible ADE), or (2) mutations overrepresented with vaccinated people because of <strong>vaccinated people being the origin of mutations</strong> themselves. Although variants were formerly named after their the country of first discovery, specific similar mutations were seen to emerge in different locations indicating the viral adaptation to specific environment, in casu similar injection induced spiike protein immune response. One scenario doesn't exclude the other, so both are simultaneously plausible.</p>

        <p>Wait until the general population learns that vaccinating into a pandemic causes mutations. Oh wait they'll never learn this was a dumb idea from the start.</p>
