    <strong>I don’t want to keep sitting around reading about the dystopia we’re living in and how it’s going to get worse. I want to do something about it.</strong>
    <p><p>So I don’t wear a mask in stores and I’ve thought about printing out flyers and posting them around the city but I want to do more. There’s strength in numbers and I wanted to have a discussion with all of you so we can brainstorm ideas on how to actively fight what’s happening and really make our voices heard.</p></p>

        <p>The best and most effective thing you or anyone else can do at this point is NOT WEAR THE MUZZLE. </p>
<p>It's more effective than most people realize. As long as the visual manifestation of the "pandemic" is there, we can't dream of living normally.</p>

        <p>this is very true. when i walk around and see someone without it, i smile and air fist pump them and say 'freedom eh!' and they get it</p>

        <p>What about then in stores? Some days I just don't want to be hassled by staff but most days I am prepared to walk out and take my business elsewhere if need be. Sometimes that's not an option though and I just suck it up and wear the diaper.</p>

        <p>This is the best plan for Americans. If you live in Canada or Europe where they are fining people, you need to organize anti-mask protests and face the fines. Don't pay them. I know that makes you a martyr but that's the only way. Every group that defied tyranny had to deal with fines. Now it's fines but if you don't stand up and resist, it will be prison, then camps.</p>

        <p>Where I live, the country made it an actual law,a legal requirement to wear a mask in any indoor public space. Police are giving out fines. How can we not wear a muzzle then? I’d love to not to but I can’t afford a fine...this is a trap</p>

<p>I would gladly give it up but I'm not in the position to afford fines right now... I'm even stuck in a job I hate because I'm scared of not being able to find another one...</p>

        <p>and so what if they do? this is just you experiencing discrimination and persecution for the first time perhaps. get used to it. and realize no one can do anything without it being assault. all they can do is make comments and give looks</p>
<p>something that helped me is to think 'im in a video game and these are programmed bots running around as holograms. wow how concincing it looks. look this one can even try to speak to me. how cute.' like you are on a disney land treasure island trip</p>

        <p>The more I do it, the more I enjoy doing it and as the first two comments say, it has a powerful effect on others. Yesterday in town I was confronted in each of the three shops I went in. They all said 'do you have a mask? No, Do you want one? No thanks. I also made an online complaint about one of the staff harassing me in an Asda store and that's being followed up. 
But to answer your first question. I always think stickers are a good idea. Easy to put everywhere and not get caught and you can sneakily get a message into everyone's subconscious.<br>
I feel like it's a bit late now though. Everybody I overheard in town was talking excitedly about getting the vaccine. They truly are a lost cause.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it’s tough but also feels refreshing in its defiance... what has 2020 come to that being yourself is an act of rebellion...</p>
<p>If it’s an employee who says something I’ll usually comply because they can legally kick you out and refusal to leave would be trespassing. I’ve yet to have another customer say something, though. When that happens, I’m not yet sure if I’ll be an ass, laugh, or just ignore it to piss him off and try to avoid getting mauled by a crazy.</p>

        <p>Yeah I think what makes me nervous also is like the second day I decided to go maskless some girl took a snapchat of me and posted it to her story with the caption “you’re a bitch for being in cvs without a mask” and one of my friends knew her and saw it on her story and recorded it off a diff phone and sent it to me. That made me uneasy and creeped out knowing I never noticed her filming me and that some random girl posted  me on her snapchat.</p>

        <p>Another positive thing is to make connections with more people outside your normal “demographic.” People are being divided and isolated by race, religion, sexuality, politics, etc. but I’m pretty sure there are people from every walk of life who aren’t drinking the kool aid, so we need to befriend rational free thinking people and have real relationships with them</p>

        <p>Send the people you know videos and articles that support our arguments. Post them to social media. Spread awareness of the potential dangers of this vaccine. Be that annoying person.</p>
<p>I sent my lefty friend that had a "idgaf I'll just get the vaccine who cares" mentality the video below and it completely changed how he feels about it. These people are uninformed and we have to do something about it.</p>

<p>Another good source is the petition by the former VP of Pfizer that lists the additional concerns of female infertility and allergic reactions to the vaccine:</p>

        <p>Vandalism has been a thing I started yesterday. Where you can, tear down the propaganda. I also have paint pens that I've been writing anti covid slogans (so far on the inside of bathroom cubicles but I'm trying to be more confident!).</p>
<p>One idea I have is if we all bring together our stories to show the suffering caused by lockdown and put them in a video or something. It would counteract the sob stories of rare covid deaths.</p>
<p>And flyers, art etc sounds like a great idea!</p>
