<title>The rate at which COVID-19 new cases was dropping was faster before mass vaccination than after. There has been no drop in daily new cases in nearly two months despite over 100 million additional doses of vaccine administered. State persistence of lockdowns/mandates has also offered no correlation.</title>

        <p>FYI: I am not an anti-vaxxer, but I do think that the fearmongering/gaslighting of the general population is political/propaganda in nature and outcome of this virus would have been no different if it were handled just like the common flu. I do not believe - based on the year+ of global data that we have - that any intervention utilized has offered any benefit, other than targeted efforts at high-risk individuals. COVID-19 at this point is the epitome of sunk cost.</p>

        <p>Much worse than zero benefit. How many were killed early on  due to unnecessary and dangerous ventilators?</p>
