    <strong>Isn’t there a saying somewhere about not stressing the things you can’t control?</strong>
    <p><p>It’s like people have found the off button on their brains for the past year. Did lockdowns prevent COVID? Did masks? Did social distancing? Would we have to keep coming up with new solutions if any of this was working? Now we’ve nearly gone full circle and the miracle cure everyone wants to force down our throats isn’t working either, even according to their own authority figures. </p>
<p>At what point are people going to realize that this is not something we can control? I am more and more baffled each day that people are still living in fear, I genuinely do not understand how. My work requires me to go inside 6 - 8 different homes each day and that is what I have done since the very beginning of this nightmare. I have a coworker who has done the same through this period and is STILL scared, despite being vaccinated. I recently returned from a trip to Miami FL and the second sentence out of his mouth after asking how my trip was “let me know where you are going to walk, I don’t want to catch that Florida variant.” Funny side note, this same person called in not more than 3 hours later than they said that to me to tell my boss that they were exposed to someone with COVID during their bible study and ended up going home for the weekend. </p>
<p>I feel less and less familiar with the world and the people in it each day. I don’t understand how we can be called plague rats, treated as subhuman, forced as a requirement of employment to get the vaccine when it is abundantly clear it has little to no effect preventing people from spreading/becoming infected. I’m sure you’ve all seen the MSNBC article stating that 75% of the cases in Massachusetts were vaccinated. What I really don’t get is don’t the unvaccinated have the advantage here, considering they have a higher likelihood of becoming aware that they are infected in the first place so that they can then stay home and avoid spreading while symptomatic? You know, like normal?</p>
<p>How do we even go back to normal when this dynamic between people is at such a volatile point, I don’t see it just dying back down when/if this goes away, even if the media said COVID was over and stopped talking about it they have been driving this fear and hate towards the other arguably since before trump was even elected. It will be interesting to see where they drive it next because it seems like this crisis is running out of steam. </p>
<p>I’m incredibly thankful for this community and the support for one another that I’ve seen even lurking until now; thanks for being here and reading my incoherent rambling.</p></p>

<p>I don't see people getting better even if they announced Covid is over, and this seems to be a part of their plan to have masks become permanent in society, to make people so paranoid of illness that they'll willingly wear masks to prevent it. </p>
<p>I think pre-2020 life is gone. To be honest, your title applies to our side as well. At this point, we don't have much control anymore as to the way society is headed. I'm trying very hard to come to terms with this. I don't see us "winning" and having 2019 life come back. Even if we somehow prevent the tyranny that is brewing, which I highly doubt at this point, I don't see life going back to how it was in the past... As disgusted as I feel about this, there will be a "new normal" when the dust settles. I don't imagine it will be pleasant, whether we "win" or not. I think society's changed forever due to this mess.</p>

        <p>It sure seems like that is the direction we are headed in, they’re starting to require masks for entry to a lot of places near me again. </p>
<p>I think you’re right there really isn’t any going back and I agree that we should not worry as we don’t have any control over this, but at the same time bearing that in mind I just don’t really see any reason to participate in society in the first place if that’s the direction things are going to go in. I’d sooner live off grid without any modern conveniences and try to start a new society than participate in one that is dead set on taking away everything that makes us human. I understand even living off grid may not be an option forever once a system of global control and surveillance is implemented but I’d rather spend my final days doing that and feeling a connection to the earth that bore us than to try and fit into a society that wants a monopoly on human life from birth to death.</p>

        <p>I reluctantly agree, I wish that protests or civil disobedience has some effect, but it seems central government power is far too powerful to influence. It is so centralised, it is mind boggling. I wasn't a conspiracy guy, until I saw the World Economic Forum come out and openly state they have made themselved self appointed arbiters of global government policies, call it new normal or great reset, same thing. It is like a terrifying Aldous Huxley novel, but even worse, cause at least in Brave New World they had Soma to feel happy about their absolute servility to the state. In this dystopian novel, we don't have such options.</p>
<p>This is a fucking horror show to any true democrat or libertarian, cause genuine liberalism, democracy and libertarianism are all completely gone in politics... Sick of it, and I'm sick of being called crazy because I don't believe what I'm told by our government or our 'journalists'</p>
<p>I think they are crazy to accept all this nonsense without resistance.</p>

        <p>Yes, agreed. I always enjoyed mysteries and conspiracy theories, and while I always kept an open mind to possibilities back then, I never really thought the world governments could work together in the way displayed in 2020, in a coup of sorts, to strip humanity of their rights. But here we are. It's a horror show, as you described. The worst part is the support and clamor for tyranny. People seem to <em>want</em> this. I've seen this online, and also offline, thus I know how twisted people are right now, and it is fucking scary that this is actually happening to us.</p>

        <p>The Serenity Prayer is a prayer written by the American theologian Reinhold Niebuhr[1][2] (1892–1971). It is commonly quoted as:</p>
<p>God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, 
courage to change the things I can, 
and wisdom to know the difference.[1]</p>
<p>Niebuhr's prayer originally asked for courage first, and specifically for changing things that must be changed, not things that simply can be changed:</p>
<p>Father, give us courage to change what must be altered, serenity to accept what cannot be helped, and the insight to know the one from the other.[3]
Niebuhr composed the prayer in 1932–33.[1] The prayer spread rapidly, often without attribution to Niebuhr, through church groups in the 1930s and 1940s and was adopted and popularized by Alcoholics Anonymous and other twelve-step programs. Niebuhr used it in a 1943 sermon at Heath Evangelical Union Church in Heath, Massachusetts. It also appeared in a sermon of Niebuhr's in the 1944 Book of Prayers and Services for the Armed Forces,[1] while Niebuhr first published it in 1951 in a magazine column.[1][4]</p>
