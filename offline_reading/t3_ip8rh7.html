    <strong>Everyone's an Anti-Masker deep down</strong>
    <p><p>Forgive me if this point has already been prominently stated, I'm sure I'm not the first one to have this thought.</p>
<p>It occurred to me recently that most people who preach pro-mask rhetoric neglect their own professed standards around the people they should care about most. Even my most stalwart pro-mask friends don't wear their masks in private when they're at a party with friends or spending time with family. So, either these people don't actually care about their friends and family compared with total strangers (unlikely), or they don't actually believe masks work and are doing it to avoid being seen as non-compliant, <em>or</em> they just don't think the virus is that dangerous and bonding with friends is more important than being 100% safe.</p>
<p>If masks did work and the virus was dangerous, all of these people would be masked around their loved ones. The fact that they aren't speaks volumes. I think this will be my argument of choice from now on.</p></p>

        <p>This is 100% true.  Three people in my life are rabid about masks at the grocery store but at our house, enclosed space for several hours drinking and laughing? No masks.  These people know they aren't getting rona at the grocery store.</p>

        <p>The ideal medium for transmission of the virus seems to be prolonged indoor interaction in poorly ventilated spaces. So yes, you're right. In a grocery store you're unlikely to have prolonged interaction with a carrier.</p>

        <p>I had a similar conversation with my mom the other day. My family lives in other states, and I live with my dogs. The only way I can see that people are still accepting of the lockdowns and masks is that they really aren't--I think secretly many, not just hypocritical politicians, are covertly disregarding the rules and mandates put into place this spring. </p>
<p>They may not even consciously acknowledge that they're doing it, but I'm fairly certain that neighbors are having dinners and drinks at each others' homes, families are spending time together with aunts, uncles, and cousins, and even grandmas, and play dates are being had. I'm not against people really socializing; I just wish they didn't make it so difficult for single people like me who don't have a neighborhood group or family nearby.</p>

        <p>I think the rational is: wear it when engaging with the great unwashed to protect me from catching something I can give to my close ones. So the assumption is that it is safe not to wear them around loved ones because they were protected earlier.</p>
<p>Of course when the idea was flipped that masks don't protect you but protect others (source control) this makes it a requirement for 100% compliance outside of their social group in order to be safe within it without wearing one.</p>
<p>There is a trail of logic there that leads to your conclusion about wearing one within their social circles; it'd be the most effective way to prevent infecting their loved ones.</p>
<p>These all rest on assumptions based on disputed evidence of course.</p>

        <p>Or... or... hear me out here... we understand that the virus mainly affects old people so we care more about spreading it to them?</p>
<p>I used to pick my great grandma up once per week for fish and chips, she‚Äôs 91, I haven‚Äôt seen her for months now as if she gets COVID she will die. I have a couple of mates around every weekend though, why? Because me and my mates are all healthy and in our mid 20‚Äôs.</p>
<p>When I go to the supermarket I‚Äôll wear a mask because I‚Äôm not a selfish cunt, I understand that old people need to do their shopping too, it‚Äôs not a personal visit it‚Äôs a visit out of absolute necessity for the vast majority of the population. When my mates call around to my house we‚Äôre all aware we could spread the virus to each other and accept that risk, the same can‚Äôt be said for those visiting a shop to buy food and other essentials necessary to survive.</p>

        <p>Yes, but that argument has always existed way before 2020...the elderly have ALWAYS been vulnerable to disease.   The difference is now, the whole population is  being forced to wear masks, social distance and destroying the economy for a subset of the population that has always been vulnerable.   </p>
<p>What changed in 2020?  A hyper pushed narrative of fear by the media and propagated by politicians for an endgame that NOBODY should be cheering for.   Its never been about the virus, its just a means to an end.</p>

        <p>Bullshit. Look at countries like New Zealand which acted fast and literally eradicated the virus in their country and have returned to living life normally then look at countries like the USA which acted slowly and still hasn‚Äôt put in proper restrictions and look at the death toll caused. 200,000 people dead, 200,000 families torn apart.</p>

        <p>They didn't eradicate anything.</p>
<p>Presumably, they still live on Planet Earth and wish to allow others from across the planet to enter their country. That's not possible unless they reopen, and as soon as they do, the virus will spread across their unexposed population.</p>
<p>So they're sheltered in place, hoping that all the other places on Earth succeed in either eradicating the virus (which they won't, since that process takes decades), or in developing a vaccine which provides total immunity (which they won't, since vaccines for the type of virus this is don't exist).</p>

        <p>You can travel there if you're very well off and have nothing but time, since they make you stay at a quarantine center on your own dime for the first 14 days. I guess if you have a month to kill, and live in a place where they don't make you quarantine for 14 days when you return from overseas, it might work. Suffice to say that NZ's tourism industry is shot to Hell. And they can't reopen to the outside world completely, because their population hasn't been exposed to the virus.

<p>If you don't go through an outbreak, you'll never get on the other side. There will be no vaccine. The virus will not just disappear.

        <p>And what will that vaccine do? Will it do what the virus itself won't, which is confer long-term immunity? Will it do what the flu shot does, which is reduce the chances of infection, and reduce the symptoms in those that do get infected, while leaving most of the population able to spread the virus much as we have been doing all along? Or will it do what every other attempted vaccines for viruses of this type do, which is make the one vaccinated at risk for a more serious reaction if they get re-infected with the actual virus?</p>
<p>Four years. That's how long the fastest vaccine ever reached the public. And that one wasn't relying on cutting-edge, never-before-tried technology. If you think that large numbers of people are willing to turn themselves and their children into genetic engineering experiments, you got another think coming.</p>

        <p>We both live less than 30 minutes drive from each other in the UK so I‚Äôm not 100% sure how Bernie comes into this.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll break it down for you as you don‚Äôt seem too bright.</p>
<p>With current restrictions in place here in the UK the R rating currently sits between 0.3 and 1.2 dependant on location, the R rating is how many people are likely to be infected from one person. So if you had a country with a population of 1,000 with 100 infected people if the R rating was 1 then after 1 IVC there would still be around 100 people infected. If the R rating was 0.5 there would be around 50 people infected after 1 IVC. If the R rating was 2 then there would be 200 people infected after 1 IVC.</p>
<p>If a vaccine with 50% efficiency was deployed this would reduce infections by roughly half, with current measures in place here in the U.K. the R rating of the absolute worst hit areas are 1.2, they would drop to around 0.6 and infections would reduce rapidly. It would only take a few IV cycles and then the virus would be effectively extinct. I‚Äôm not saying there wouldn‚Äôt be any trace of it ever or that any mutations would spring up down the line, what I am saying is that we could return to normal life without a surge of infections and deaths.</p>
<p>Usually in life if you disagree with every leading expert in a field then you‚Äôre in the wrong, not them. Every leading epidemiologist has advised that most countries locked down too late and eased restrictions too early. The virus isn‚Äôt a hoax and anyone who believes otherwise is a complete and utter moron.</p>

        <p>Now I'm not sure how UK "maths" work, but here in the US, when something is only 50% effective, that leaves 50% of the population able to both contract and spread the virus. It succeeds in slowing down the spread so that some lives can be saved and hospitals don't get overrun, but most of the world did that with COVID months ago. Now the goalposts have been moved and "eradication" is the unachievable goal.</p>
<p>If we get a vaccine that only half the population accepts, and it's only 50% effective, this still leaves New Zealand sheltering in place, since few of their people have been exposed. It would be like what happened during the Colonization Period, when Europeans "discovered" the New World and brought diseases that were endemic to their population, but novel to the natives.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm not sure how compact mathematics works in the US so I‚Äôll break it down for you slightly by quoting one of my other posts:</p>
<p>If a vaccine with 50% efficiency was deployed this would reduce infections by roughly half, with current measures in place here in the U.K. the R rating of the absolute worst hit areas are 1.2, they would drop to around 0.6 and infections would reduce rapidly. It would only take a few IV cycles and then the virus would be effectively extinct. I‚Äôm not saying there wouldn‚Äôt be any trace of it ever or that any mutations would spring up down the line, what I am saying is that we could return to normal life without a surge of infections and deaths.</p>
<p>Usually in life if you disagree with every leading expert in a field then you‚Äôre in the wrong, not them. Every leading epidemiologist has advised that most countries locked down too late and eased restrictions too early. The virus isn‚Äôt a hoax and anyone who believes otherwise is a complete and utter moron.</p>

        <p>At 100% acceptance, which will never happen. Do you know what will happen first? Spread. I actually read a conversation between two doctors where one of them feared that acceptance of the first vaccine would drag out for so long that the virus itself would weaken, and people wouldn't fear getting infected.</p>
<p>Funny thing about experts: you can find a lot of them, and sometimes they'll actually agree. Science is the same way. Realistically, the "experts" plug in their numbers and come up with "predictions," and we haven't seen one yet that was correct.</p>
<p>We locked down too late and eased restrictions too early? Nope, we stupidly locked down in the first place out of fear. And we didn't warn the public, protect the ones in long-term-care, and go back to living our lives. Should have been done back in May, and then this would truly be over.</p>

        <p>Even if NZ did eradicate the virus (they didn‚Äôt btw, they had cases pop up and went into panic mode again), they have several factors that other countries can‚Äôt really replicate.</p>
<p>That being, they have a small population (which means easier tracking), and most importantly, they‚Äôre an island nation, closing the border fully and effectively is much easier for them than any other country, and entering illegally is extremely difficult and nearly impossible to do.</p>
<p>Hate to say it, but a country that‚Äôs both much larger, with a much bigger population, and two land borders, can‚Äôt just copy NZ‚Äôs strategy wholecloth.</p>
<p>Not that it matters because again, NZ started getting cases anyway even after ‚Äúeradication‚Äù was declared.</p>

        <p>Disease has ALWAYS been with us... families worldwide have their elderly die on a daily basis from it  People like you are acting like getting sick is some new and terrible reality THAT MUST BE STOPPED AT ANY COST!   As if no one has ever died from influenza or or tuberculosis or any other of the thousands of respiratory virii and bacteria that humans are exposed to on a daily basis from time immemorial.   Where were the gov't mandates then?  </p>
<p>Truth is, youve been whipped into a frenzy of hysteria by your social media, the mainstream media and your gov't .  Youve been told to fear something and you are doing just that, without questioning ANYTHING..  The cost of lockdowns will slowly become apparent over time and its consequences will be far worse than the actual disease.</p>
<p>But im sure the brainwashed masses will get on their social media of choice and self-righteously defend that too.</p>

I live in an area with tons of people in their twenties and thirties who live either alone or with roommates around the same age, so why the hate?

        <p>This is the dumbest argument I've seen. Wearing masks  isn't to protect anyone directly from the virus. It will do that, but the idea is to reduce the transmission of it. Its everyone acting for the collective common good. A tiny sacrifice everyone can do which will lower the risk for the whole country/world. This isn't rocket science. </p>
<p>This fucking echo chamber for anti-mask idiots will just give you a false confidence in your arguments.</p>

        <p>Ruining public's health by wearing masks is stupid and has nothing to do with sacrifice. </p>
<p>What is not rocket science is that retards who are concerned about one out of an infinite number of viruses constantly circulating, should get a proper full-face respirator and stop whining to others about masks.</p>

        <p>Yes masks may reduce transmission. </p>
<p>REDUCE, you're aware that if you leave the house for any unnecessary reason you're just as guilty as those not wearing a mask, just a smaller percentage? A non mask wearer might kill 10 grandmas but you'll kill 1. Are you ok with that?</p>

        <p>Yeah its about reducing the risk. When I leave the house I social distance and where I can't distance, I wear a mask. I also limit myself to essential journeys. I work full time and have a young baby so this isn't too difficult for me anyway.</p>
<p>To answer your over simplification, yes I'd rather kill 1 granny than 10.</p>
