    <strong>I was apprehended</strong>
    <p><p>This morning I went for an MRI at a lab which is part of a huge medical complex. I wore my clear plastic face shield as a "face covering" in lieu of a mask. I was not questioned.</p>
<p>A few hours later, I entered a clinic which is also part of this venue. As I walked through the double doors, I noticed the "screening" tables off to my right, and assumed they were for the purpose of giving out vaccinations.</p>
<p>As I strolled past the tables, I heard an urgent voice saying, "Sir! Sir!". A young lady was saying I needed to stop because I was not wearing a mask.</p>
<p>I faced her, and said, "My instructions specifically stated that I was to wear a mask or face covering. This covers my entire face down to my chest".</p>
<p>She replied, "No sir! That is not a mask, it's a shield", to which I replied, "It is a face covering". I was not going to back down without a fight!</p>
<p>She informed me that if I didn't wear a mask, she would be "forced" to ask me to leave the building. I told her straight up, "I don't even have a mask", and I could sense the situation starting to escalate.</p>
<p>Changing my tactic, I asked if she had a mask I could use. Her demeanor instantly changed, and she reached into her supply box and handed me a flimsy tie-on cloth mask.</p>
<p>After stepping to the side to put on the face diaper, she expressed her appreciation for my "cooperation", and directed me to screening table 2 to get my temperature checked.</p>
<p>The young man checked my temp, filled out a label, handed it to me to stick on my shirt, and told me to "have a nice day". Being my usual smart aleck self, I said, "Don't tell me what to do!"</p>
<p>The guy looked shocked until I said, "That was a joke...", at which point we both had a good laugh.</p>
<p>My office visit continued uneventfully, and my doctor and his assistant got a chuckle out of my story.</p>
<p>Folks, it's gotten pretty hard core around here, and I live in a southern state. I felt really sad to see everyone around me wearing a mask and hiding their beautiful faces.</p>
<p>On the local radio news channel, a host stated, "Covid is not going away", to which I was in agreement. However, I'm really concerned that our society is becoming more authoritarian.</p></p>
