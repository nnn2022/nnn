    <strong>I‘m sick of it</strong>
    <p><p>Right now, everything is closed where I live, and you are only allowed to meet with one other household at once. These rules are in place since November, yet cases are still rising since then and there is no end is sight.</p>
<p>I feel extremely exhausted. Everything that made life enjoyable for me is gone and it will stay this way for the next months. Going to restaurants with friends or my parents, having a relaxed evening with my friends at the bar, meeting beautiful women when going out, or just having fun at parties and not thinking about these restrictions that regulate every single aspect of our lives. I‘m 23 years old, and I want to enjoy my youth now as long as it lasts. Currently, I‘m just sitting home doing nothing, and it drives my crazy that we can’t change anything about this, because most people are just scared and follow these authoritarian measures.</p>
<p>It’s not just about me. I know people who have businesses that don’t know what to do. Their complete existence is being destroyed within a few months. My father is at home with no work since March and will be probably for the next few months as long as the restrictions are in place. Young people get depressed, and older people don’t visit the doctor for far more serious diseases like cancer or heart attacks, because they are scared of Covid thanks to the media. Children have to sit hours with those masks in classroom. Yesterday I walked through my city, it looks like a ghost town with all businesses closed and barely anyone outside. Just police everywhere, that controls whether you are wearing your mask and aren’t outside with more than one household. It’s a truly dystopian world right now.</p>
<p>And for what? A disease with over 99% survival rate, almost 100% for those with a functioning immune system. Everyone who really fears Covid can wear a mask or self-isolate. But why has everyone to do so? I‘m not responsible for other people’s health and as long as I don’t go out sick and and actively endanger other people’s health I won’t feel bad for doing all the things I want to do. Everyone has to think about the risks he or she is willing to take and what to do, but you can’t force people to live your way and take their basic human rights. We always have to find a good balance between public health/safety and freedom/efficiency, but the current state is cleary not a good balance and does more harm than good. If our government really was so worried about our people’s health, they wouldn’t have ignored the warnings about Covid earlier this year. They would have started to protect the vulnerable people early on, and they wouldn’t constantly ignore the restrictions  themselves. It’s not about our health, it’s about control and creating fear to establish an authoritarian government without people questioning. And it works, sadly.</p>
<p>I‘m sorry if this text offers nothing new and you heard these points before, but I‘m just sick of it. I want people to enjoy their lives, business owners having an income, and society not living in constant fear. I want my own life back, and I won’t take any vaccine for it, because it’s about my basic rights that nobody should be able to take away.</p></p>

        <p>Good for you for standing your ground. Stay strong dude. Let your light shine. You’ll be looking at them pretty girls and dancing soon enough. Keep positive and keep a song in your steps. Others will follow your lead. Be strong for your parents. Poverty is hard but it can be overcome.</p>

        <p>I'm the same age as you, and I'm sad that I'm wasting my early 20s. Time is something we'll never get back and I resent everyone who went along with the propaganda and believes everything the government tells them. </p>
<p>It's so hard to stay positive when it feels like there's no end in site. But, I try to do small things like not wear my mask until I'm forced to, and visit my friends when I can. We just have to collectively refuse to go along with the BS.</p>
<p>Everything in my state is also closed besides grocery stores, so I'm seriously considering moving to a state with no restrictions. We'll get through this, we just have to not give up.</p>

        <p>I completely agree. I'm in BC, and we have the same rules. But, for Christmas, my fiance and I are still going to go to his mom's. I'm tired of living in fear, and missing out on life. It's just bullshit already.</p>

        <p>I am old enough to be your mom. Coming up on my 58th birthday....please stay strong and don’t give up.  There are many more that feel as you do. Including myself.  I have sons your age. They are in the same boat.  We live in Diblasiio world where everything has changed. I tell you what I tell them... things will get better.  Be patient and you’re not alone. Just focus on one day at a time and try to find happiness in the small things.  I know it sounds corny but trust me...at least give it a try and I will pray for you this holiday❤️🙏🏻🌲</p>

        <p>You are correct on every point. The only way out of this horror is to organize your friends and relatives in your own small community and don't comply with any of the restrictions. Ignore the mask mandates and restrictions on social gatherings. Go to your favorite bar -- find the owner and encourage him or her to open and then get 100 people to support that business. Remember there are more of us than them. They can't arrest all of us. Get out in the streets and DEMAND your rights as a free human being. Your courage will then inspire others and soon we will have a revolution that returns us to a normal life.</p>
