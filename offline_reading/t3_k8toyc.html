    <strong>Has anyone had a covid related hostile hospital experience? Either personally, with a family member or friend? This is a long post but looking for opinions.</strong>
    <p><p>This turned out way longer than expected sorry..</p>
<p>Im gonna try and write this as promptly as possible. 
It really is a long story but there is so much shady stuff that i cant leave out. </p>
<p>About 2 weeks ago my husband's grandfather (pop) received the flu shot, the very next day he was sick, with flu symptoms. He was sick for 9 days, laying in bed for about 5. He was dehydrated so my husband's grandmother (Nan) called the ambulance and they confirmed hes dehydrated and his heart beat was off, they take him to the hospital.  (I was not aware he was as sick as he was until i was told he would be going to the hospital). At this time i started freaking out because i straight up don't trust the hospital, i called my mother in law who is also power of attorney and the entire family trying to calmly explain why they need to get pop out of there. </p>
<p>The next morning i called MIL and asked for the update.. they tested him for covid and pneumonia and confirmed positive for both. MIL informed me they were giving him fluids and a steriod. That same day i called the hospital to tell them to make sure they treat his lungs they're top priority, they sounded all good and cooperative. We talked to pop he was awake sounded alot better was finally eating coherent vitals are good. Although he told us on the phone they asked if they can try an experimental drug on him for covid treatment.. we begged him not to take it and he told us he wouldn't.</p>
<p>I told my husband we need to get him tomorrow morning no matter what, i knew they were going kill him in my gut. Except come that morning pop wouldn't answer his cell. The hospital wouldn't wake him up so we can speak to him. They told me at the desk they were  treating him with redmisvir and plasma transfusions. At this point between going through my MIL and talking to nurses that all seem to be oblivious i kept calling the hospital demanding they treat his lungs and stop covid treatment. But they didnt. I didnt know it was ultimately up to power of attorney. </p>
<p>We talked to him briefly in the afternoon at around 4 not even 24 hrs later after literally blowing up the hospital phone and his cell but his cell was dead now. He asked to be picked up and sounded really bad he wasn't talking full sentances and seemed to have a hard time getting the air to speak. His lungs seemed to decline mighty fast for how good they were the day before. </p>
<p>My hands were tied, the entire family was oblivious to what was happening in the world and thought they were helping him. After literally freaking out and telling everyone he was going to die with out the pneumonia meds i finally got Nan to listen and me and my husband went down to get him. Except they wouldn't let us in. We told the nurses its an emergency we need to get to the nurses station.. 
We were surrounded by security and told to call my MIL. </p>
<p>We ran to the car called MIL and said she had to come now and get him out she then informed us we cant they just called and said he has a blood clot they cant move him until they do a CT. I hung up on her and called Nan and said he only has minutes to get those meds his lungs are going to be too damaged. Nan is in a wheel chair has alot of trouble walking, but said she is coming down to get him. (God bless her.) 1 minute later MIL calls and tells my husband to go to the doors Pops vitals dropped and they cant get them back up. MIL says they will let u in the doors just go down to the screening tent. </p>
<p>They wouldn't let us in. The people at the tent are honestly so weird they come out in full PPE in the calmest voices and say we need to leave and call the hospital they cant help us. </p>
<p>At this point my husband is on the parking lot ground in cold ass weather crying to let him in. I just got so pissed off. Started snapping out demanding they get one of us up there. 4 security guards come out the nurses start telling me how i am a bad person for not wearing a mask.. amazing. Long story short they let finally let him in. </p>
<p>Here's where it gets messed up. </p>
<p>Im sitting in the parking lot in my car expecting my husband say goodbye and just spend time. </p>
<p>Now i have a lifelong friend who finished nursing school last year and her mother runs a nursing home for years as the head RN supervisor. She has had 100s of covid cases and no deaths yet. She treats them with vitamin c, zinc and antibiotics and it has been working so far.. whether or not its the right treatment im not sure. But its working. If we got him out i was taking him straight to her. </p>
<p>So out of desperation my husband calls and is reading pops stats off to my friend and her mom. They both say his vitals are actually good get him the meds now, hes not dead! My husband's up there for an hour at this time the nurse gives meds to bring his vitals back to normal. Now Nan finally makes it and is in the room. Pop is 100% he was even trying to talk responding to verbal stimuli. But seemed not totally conscious. But his vitals were good, his heart rate was a little fast tho. I cannot remember the exact rate but he wasnt aFib or anything and my friend assured me hes got a good chance. </p>
<p>But they still havent administered the vitamin c antibiotics or zinc, they also refuse to show us his charts. They keep saying theyre waiting approval. His wife of 66 years is sitting in the same room demanding the meds and charts .. how could they deny it. </p>
<p>My friend is on the phone telling me to refer the message to my husband to check pops oxygen machine as it cant be up to high, but my husband never gets the message because he gets kicked out of the room. </p>
<p>He realized the person holding up the meds was my MIL the power of attorney. When he called her to tell her she needs to approve it she sent security to remove him and asked to enter the room. She texted us and said he is 100% when she entered the room.. </p>
<p>She wouldn't work with us she only tried one round of meds when she was there and wouldn't stay in contact with us.. she text us about an hour later.. pop had total organ failure and his labs doubled? I don't understand how his organs failed that fast. We asked to bring him to our home to die but as soon as we said we will administer the meds here she said he wouldn't make it till morning for transportation. </p>
<p>We accepted it went to bed coming to terms he was dying and we tried.. </p>
<p>Wake up at 7 am. Pops still alive,  we called immediately thinking she started the meds back up. She didn't she said he has internal bleeding and underlying issues and put him on a morphine drip. 
The underlying issue was colon cancer, apparently pop was hiding this from everyone bc he was embarrassed. </p>
<p>He died later that afternoon. </p>
<p>His doctor called and said none of this makes sense.  And asked to open an investigation. Nan dont want covid on his death certificate. We know he didnt have covid. No one else got sick. And Nan has MS and a terrible immune system how did she not catch it? And how does his own doctor that hes gone to his for probably 50 years not aware he has cancer? If his doctor doesnt know how did he find out.. </p>
<p>My MIL kept saying this is what he wanted he signed a DNR when he got there... i know in my heart he wouldn't have signed that.</p>
<p>So first he has a heart problem that went away when he got there. 
Then covid, then pneumonia. 
Then a blood clot. Then when we show up and say we want to remove him his vitals drop. 
Then his vitals are stable and he is very much alive his labs all normal. 
Then my husband gets kicked out and told he cant return. 
They refuse treatment. And continue remdesivir. 
He has total organ failure in an hour and his labs "doubled"? 
While he was on the morphine drip Nan said he opened his eyes and was mumbling. 
Nurse said its just a reflex. 
He wasnt supposed to make it till 7 am. But made it until around 5 pm. 
And had internal bleeding and was hiding colon cancer that only he knew about. Not his doctor not any hospital records his doctor could see knew this. </p>
<p>We haven't talked to my MIL much. Honestly she seems to be showing signs of being mentally unwell. Just by the way shes posting online and talking to family. Im not sure if she is just going through something bc her father was sick and died or if she is actually having mental issues. </p>
<p>It seems to us the hospital was doing anything they could to keep him there with little contact. It seems as if they were trying to kill him by ignoring the pneumonia. We realized they were on the phone with my MIL behind our backs telling her everything they could to make us seem we were in denial he was dying. They told her my husband was causing problems in the room thats why she made him leave and entered the room. </p>
<p>We believe they didnt want us there because they knew we didnt believe them. And i think we had good reason and i think he had a good chance at surviving. </p>
<p>He was 85.. although he didnt have health issues besides lymes disease, was very active always out and about shoveling coal, fishing, splitting firewood, taking care of his wife 24/7.  He really was in great shape for his age. Mentally and physically.</p>
<p>Our hospital has turned every floor into covid units and seems to be mostly treating only that. There is fences around the building screening tents to enter. Security everywhere. You are not able to have someone in there to advocate for you. And honestly if you go in there theres a good chance your not coming out and no one is coming in to get you. The nurses outside and security seem like literal robots with 0 emotions. Even to a man crying in the dead cold on the ground for his grandfather. </p>
<p>Has anyone else had experienced something like this first hand? I knew shit was gettin bad but seeing it in person has me totally freaked out. I feel terrible for these elderly people that are alone and being mistreated ultimately to their death and being told its covid.</p>
<p>Honestly im afraid to take my kid to her next doctor's appointment thinking their gonna try some crazy shit. </p>
<p>I fear bad times are coming up alot sooner than i expected. </p>
<p>Basically im just trying to come to terms with this. I really didn't want him to die, i tried my very best but its hard to get people to understand. I hate thinking that he died there when it was so beyond preventable.. but i think the hospital makes it almost impossible to help them. </p>
<p>I believe they did something to him when we were outside to make his vitals drop if they even did drop and i believe what ever it was made him completely unconscious so he couldnt say he wanted to leave again. I believe they were telling my MIL different info to get us out of the picture. </p>
<p>Idk if im crazy thinking this way or im sensing something is off because it actually is.</p></p>
