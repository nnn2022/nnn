        <p>Can't wait.  The vaccine is only estimated at 35% effective.  How many gene theropy doses will there be?  Is this would turning into THX 1138?</p>

        <p>You can bet your bottom dollar more variants are on the way. </p>
<p>All the glorious journalists and esteemed medical professionals are probably on a Zoom call, as we speak, going over all the names of the new, terrifying mutations they will be telling us about, every hour on the hour, a couple of months from now.</p>
<p>Fauci and friends spent the last year and half learning what to do and what not to do when things fire up again this winter. I'm sure they are pretty upset about the unacceptable amount of people who questioned their science and declined the medicine they really, really want us to take. </p>
<p>If I were a betting man, I'd put my money on sometime in October. Most of the restrictions and lockdowns and curfews and mask laws will likely be lifted by all the world's great leaders. Not too long after that, shortly after everyone has a chance to breathe their sighs of relief, convinced its finally over, the chains will be once again be tightened. The psychology of it all is fascinating really. It's exhausting. It's demoralizing. </p>
<p>We will only be allowed to feel hope and joy for a very brief moment before being carpet bombed with breaking news about the mutated strains of wet market flu spreading across the country. The vaccine will be useless against them. Cases will be impossible to keep track of. All of us who didn't feel comfortable injecting the experimental medicine will be responsible for the chaos. We won't really see any of it happening around us but, it will be. They say so. A new kind of terror will be created overnight. And, we will be forced to spend another winter, inside, mask on, in our covid pods.</p>
