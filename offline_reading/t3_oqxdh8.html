    <strong>I finally understand this Bible verse</strong>
    <p><p>Of course the Bible uses the word “sheep” completely differently than we do today for those who blindly trust authority. </p>
<p>In this sense, a “sheep” is a follower of Jesus, with the Shepard as Christ leading His people. </p>
<p>Anyway, here it is. </p>
<p><strong>The Sheep and the Goats</strong></p>
<p>&rt;31 “When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne. 32 All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 33 He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.</p>
<p>&rt;34 “Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. 35 For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, 36 I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.’</p>
<p>&rt;37 “Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? 38 When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? 39 When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?’</p>
<p>&rt;40 “The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’</p>
<p>&rt;41 “Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. 42 For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, 43 I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.’</p>
<p>&rt;44 “They also will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?’</p>
<p>&rt;45 “He will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.’</p>
<p>&rt;46 “Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.”</p></p>

        <p>I must say that I am beyond ecstatic that we have more people discussing Christianity on this sub because more people are starting to come to the conclusion that what we are witnessing is exactly what the Bible warned us about.</p>

        <p>On a personal note, I don’t know what hell is, and don’t fully embrace the concept of hell as eternal fire.  I take everything with a grain of salt.  </p>
<p>But this verse rings out with a lot of truth.</p>

        <p>Psalm 23 tells us that the Lord is our shepherd. We are His sheep. John 10 reminds us that we are the sheep that answer to the sound of His voice. There are many shepherds, and many sheep, but sheep won’t answer to the voice of the shepherd that is not their own.</p>
