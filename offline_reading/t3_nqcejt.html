        <p>Honestly... I really hate to say it, as I am a compassionate person... but anyone who hears this... or anything like this... on TV or social media or an article... and decides to go have themselves injected.... deserve whatever they get. I now only feel bad for people who may be old and a bit scared and talked to their doctor and doctor duped them into getting it.... Most people I have spoken to that have gone and gotten injected with the unapproved vaccines say they didn't even speak to their doctor! "Oh, no I just called and made an appointment etc." These people, while they may be victims, at this point it is like the fly that gets caught in a spider's web. Forces of nature are at play here and there are predators out their laying out the bait and people are taking it and walking into the trap. My dad... a guy I thought was smart... fell for it. He got his moderna shots and showed me the fact sheet they gave him... a few sheets stapled together and it literally says it is not approved... that the trials are ongoing... that it is only emergency use... explains about vaccine injuries and other red flag type language... gives the ingredients... sm 102... if you haven't heard or seen that one yet, look up safety sheet on it... toxic, cancer causing... infertility causing... but My dad blindly got injected for some reason... Last year around the summer time he was saying things like "yea I think it is time to move forward" i.e. the lockdown shit needs to end and we need to get back to normal... But at some point the media barrage must have broken him. I know he still watches cnn and regular network news. Really sad stuff. He even commented a few times about the obvious program language across multiple networks using the phrase "shots in arms" and showing needles going in.... and said he "wasn't in a hurry to get it" etc.... But like I said something must have broken him, probably the carrot of normality that was being tied to it. I'll never know for sure. But it is a really weird feeling knowing my Dad, who I used to look up to and admire and think was really smart... knowing he did this. He is a victim... but at the same time I warned him and spoke many times about mrna and how it never was used in humans... anyway... this shit is all satanic and anti-human and I hate living in the future. I just want a horse, some tobacco, and a gun... and no internet. But that time is past. So fuck the new normal... I hope they go all-in and try to put us non compliers in camps so I can finally become who Jesus Christ wants me to become.</p>
