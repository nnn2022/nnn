    <strong>Your sickness is their profit.</strong>
    <p><p>Not content  with destroying your immune system with these experimental toxins, they are now coming for meat. I’m old enough to remember the lies and the industry supported research that maligned meat as the evil heart killer and the potent carcinogen. </p>
<p>Now that people are waking up and realizing sugar is the killer and beef is a superfood, they are shifting gears. Now it’s climate crisis, selfishness, Bill Gates fake meat full of soy and other toxic bullshit, supply chain disruption, and if they get their way, some kind of sin tax. </p>
<p>They can only sell their toxic medicines if you are sick and what better way to accomplish that  then through your diet.  Slow chronic illnesses that won’t kill you but will make you a super customer for life. </p>
<p>Wake up and fight back.</p></p>
