    <strong>Australian here. Experiencing police states, martial law &amp; total media control of information.</strong>
    <p><p>During recent events, I’ve lost friends due to different opinions. I’ve held onto my values and self respect while trying to maintain friendships and respecting others personal choices, alas nothing.</p>
<p>To tell you how grateful I am to have a mother who is not brainwashed and isn’t forcing me or pressuring me to have the vaccine, aswell as shares the same views as most of the users here do. I cannot express enough how grateful I am for her. This woman (a single mother) is willing to take in 2 of my closest friends who have been discarded, dumped, shoved aside and betrayed by their families. Just because they don’t want the vaccine and are capable of critical thinking. People just like myself who are in a rough economic situation and it’s only been made worse by not succumbing to peer pressure by the people who are supposed to support you no matter what.
I seriously cannot imagine having a family divided by this topic and I genuinely wish the best for everyone dealing with this. It’s one thing to divide cultures and countries. It’s another to divide families. Practice positive thinking, stay strong, this cannot and WILL NOT last forever.</p></p>

        <p>So as I can only see as much as you have. I assume from this video the individual has made remarks about the NWO, communism, police states or martial law. Only a few months ago Australians were being detained for “conspiracy theories” they were sharing. So I would assume this man recited some truth &amp; the police of NSW, have decided to have him taken to a hospital for a mental examination. Which he is refusing. I know as much as you do about this video, will update if I learn more locally. As it is local to me where this was filmed.</p>

        <p>This is true however the disease specialist that was interviewed in May last year, supporting the anti lockdown position did get the prediction quite wrong. He said that he expected death toll to maybe double normal flu. He was out by more than three times over.</p>
<p>I can’t remember his name, I hope they interview him again to get a one year review on the situation.</p>
<p>The real test now will be to see their overall COVID case rates because they will have a lot of “semi” herd immunity because of the lack of lockdowns etc.</p>
<p>Here in New Zealand, the world thinks we are hot shit for managing covid.
The economic damage has yet to be realised. </p>
<p>I think if NZ gets an outbreak, we’ll have a HUGE surge of cases and deaths merely because we’ve isolated ourselves so much that our immune systems are weakened.</p>

        <p>Interesting point. I guess the Sweden situation allows us to see three different approaches: NZ &amp; Australia (total lock-down, low vax rates) Sweden (no lockdown or masks, targeted vax) and the USA (some lockdowns, some mandates, widespread vax). When looked up the data and crunched the numbers:</p>
<p>From COVID:</p>
<p>USA: roughly <strong>0.17%</strong> of population died.</p>
<p>Sweden: roughly <strong>0.14%</strong>  of population died</p>
<p>Australia: roughly <strong>0.004%</strong> of population.</p>
<p>Now Australia clearly has the lowest death count =but their country has become a fortress, practically under martial law for almost 18 months but probably no herd immunity to COVID or future variants. The US fared the worst of the three with a mix approach.</p>
<p>Look like the Swedish model is the winner: No lockdowns, no mask and only a targeted vaccination of vulnerable groups (like the elderly). And the Delta has had no impact in Sweden (I'm assuming) from their herd immunity.</p>
<p>And yeah long term that can't be good for NZ. Is there high vaccination?</p>

        <p>Recently there was a poll here in NZ (keep in mind that NZ media is heavily left wing, heavily influenced by the current closet Marxist govt and therefore super pro lock down and super pro experimental gene vaccination); the response rate was something like 54+% were not trusting the mrna vaccination.</p>
<p>They had a “mass” vaccination event last week and it was such a failure that the media were forced to report on it. Then a few days ago they said their second attempt was a great success.... but they showed no footage of the event at all.</p>
<p>I think the % vaccinated is less than 24%</p>

        <p>That's super interesting. What do you think, culturally, is at the root of that? </p>
<p>(Because it seems Australians have that same mindset = turn country in a fortress, but not a fan of vaccination)</p>

        <p>I think it’s because we haven’t had the serious amount of death and pressure in hospitals that it still feels like covid is a thing happening elsewhere so we’re somewhat relaxed about it and don’t like the idea of being “told” you need to have a medication and especially in this case, since covid “isn’t here”, it feels like “why am I taking a med for something we don’t have” so the attitude is “meh”.</p>
<p>Even with our scanning tracking system, people can’t be stuffed and despite the govt efforts, people don’t trust that their data is safe.</p>
<p>This might sound like NZers are critical and independent but they’re not. I think if we had a covid outbreak you’d see vaccination rates shoot up like crazy.</p>
<p>I’m almost inclined to think that they might deliberately allow a community outbreak purely to get vaccination rates up because politically, it looks bad on them to not have high rates and the opposition govt is using this a leverage to point fault at them.</p>

        <p>I guess it's an island mentality that the disease is "over there" like you said. NZers love to travel abroad so much, you'd think they'd be desperate by now for the country to open up again.</p>

        <p>I thought things in the UK were wild, things in the US got  wild, all months ago. I guess Australia is late to the party and everything I thought not possible to happen here, that I saw all around the world, has happened. And has been successfully implemented. </p>
<p>We have police officers at our grocery stores, making sure we check-in to the location online. Before entering. This is Australia’s new normal, seriously. So when one person comes up positive for Covid, they trace where they have been &amp; EVERYONE who visited the same
Location must self-isolate for two weeks minimum. Insane</p>

        <p>I have to say, things never got to that point here in the US. At least not on any significant scale. Sure, there's some places like NY and California that are off their rockers, but most places operated fairly normally outside of masks and no indoor dining, etc. We definitely didn't have police and military presence solely to crackdown on "lockdown" bull. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, my gut doesn't tell me that Austrailia (and places like it) are late bloomers, rather they're the trial run and they will attempt to roll this out everywhere. I have to think they are attempting this first in places that they figure will put up the least amount of resistance. </p>
<p>At this point, me and my family are preparing best we can and I hope enough people wake up to this insanity before it's too late. We need to fight back.</p>

        <p>Australia has always scared me the worst, just from what I was seeing. I'm very happy I got to spend a month there, years back, just driving around. </p>
<p>The UK has always seemed more foolish with their rules and mandates, but looks scary as well. </p>
<p>Here in the US, I have handfuls of people I can link up with that have lots of stashed food, guns, and ammo. I'm probably going to be run out of NY by vax mandates first, but at least here different states have different rules and most are filled with patriotic Americans. </p>
<p>Fingers crossed for you. And good on your Mom. I would do the same.</p>

        <p>Working out the best country to gain citizenship in, in these times. So far thinking Hungary or Finland as my fathers a Finnish born citizen. I believe I can leave Australia for a minimum 3 months for whatever reason. That’s all I need to apply for a residence permit in Finland. 
Is it worth waiting for an uprising in Australia or do I leave it all behind?</p>

        <p>I’d get out now. Though it’s not guaranteed that tyranny won’t follow. Perhaps the Finnish could be forewarned about the depths of the tyranny as people flee their homes to their country.</p>
