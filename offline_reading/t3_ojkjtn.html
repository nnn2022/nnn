    <strong>People didn't trust the science, they trusted the hypothesis</strong>
    <p><p>The hypothesis sounded great in theory, but now we are seeing the real-life trials of the vaccine, and the uncomfortable truth is that the vaccine isn't doing what they said it would do. Science is ever changing, and the current cultural climate is not allowing room for new findings to come to light.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Vaccine Design Flaws (so far):</p>
<ul>
<li>You can still transmit and spread Covid. A vaccine that lessens side effects is MUCH different than one that prevents the illness. </li>
<li>Spike Proteins are cytotoxic (toxic to living cells).</li>
<li>Spike Proteins aren't staying anchored to the spot like they said it would. 75% is collected by your lymphatic system and spread into circulation. </li>
<li>People sharing their adverse reactions are being censored across the board.</li>
<li>VAERS has more adverse reactions that all the vaccines combined in the last 30 years and yet they are using lotteries, free donuts, and even cutting prison sentences as a reward for taking it.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The part that bothers me the most is that nobody is being told about these things. People in my life are so unaware of what is happening! When I try to talk about it they tell me I'm fear-mongering. Its like, do you want comfort or do you want to help me find the truth? I'm trying to put all the puzzle pieces together and figure this thing out. We are all in uncharted waters here.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And now look at France: You can have freedom, but first play Russian Roulette with your health.</p></p>

<p>I am new here because I am trying to read all the same things my husband reads and comes home to tell me.  I am not a covid denier and I do not support the vaccine. I would say I am probably team "just leave me alone until this is over" or bury my bead in the sand which is what it is... </p>
<p>But I am honestly curious what you guys think putting the puzzles together solve? What are you actually going to figure out?  What are you planning to do with that knowledge?  What will change when you have "put it together" in your mind?  I mean if the whole thing is a fucking sham to garner control of the population wouldn't it already be too late once the regular folks begin to figure it out? I mean this is a global problem.    </p>
<p>Please don't take this the wrong way - I truly want opinions on this.</p>

        <p>Yeah fair questions! What am I truly looking for...</p>
<p>I think everything feels so dissonant right now. Like what mainstream media is saying is not aligning with what the censored people are saying, almost like there are two separate planes of thinking. I truly feel like the world is in two separate realities right now.</p>
<p>I guess I'm looking for some evidence or information that will bring everybody back to the same page. Something to bridge the divide.</p>

        <p>Hey, I'm opposed as well, but let's be clear and factual.</p>
<p>&rt;You can still transmit and spread Covid. A vaccine that lessens side effects is MUCH different than one that prevents the illness.</p>
<p>No vaccine is 100% effective. This is essentially PR.  They have to state this because they have insisted on the concept of "asymptomatic transmission".  You can certainly be exposed and horbor the measles virus after the MMR vaccine.  You probably won't get symptoms.  But in the past that was not called infection.  The narrative is necessary to maintain NPI protocols. If it were 100% there is no need for masks or distancing or any such. </p>
<p>&rt; Spike Proteins are cytotoxic (toxic to living cells).</p>
<p>Yeah that's the big one. Not 100% proven, but very likely.  But hey, if we had done long-term testing we would know. </p>
<p>&rt;Spike Proteins aren't staying anchored to the spot like they said it would. 75% is collected by your lymphatic system and spread into circulation.</p>
<p>I had not run into the claim that they would not spread.   But if they are cytotoxic as above the difference is moot, is it not?  But how is it collected by the lymphatic system if it has not already spread? I have no lymph nodes in my deltoid. </p>
<p>&rt; People sharing their adverse reactions are being censored across the board.</p>
<p>Can't argue here. Although Reddit is not everywhere, it sure looks like it.</p>
<p>&rt;VAERS has more adverse reactions that all the vaccines combined in the last 30 years and yet they are using lotteries, free donuts, and even cutting prison sentences as a reward for taking it.</p>
<p>True.
