    <strong>The ever-changing mask rules...</strong>
    <p><p>I live in germany. It's still hell here with Covid. And it just got a bit stupider/more infuriating, since we got a new rule that only FFP2 masks are allowed in public transportation under the threat of heavy fines.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>How more restrictive can it get? First they told us that cloth masks are completely fine and we stocked up on them to save money, since they're reusable. Now they are useless and not enough anymore.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Then it was medical masks and we stocked up on them, but with the new FFP2 rule those old masks have largely become a waste as well. I'm just waiting for the day that FFP2 masks become useless and instead it'll become mandatory to wear two masks. Or hell, even three. I'm sure enough suckers would do it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And you think the government is gonna compensate us for all the wasted money? No, of fucking course not. During the over one year this has all been going on, I had been granted 10 (fucking 10!) free FFP2 masks and MAYBE 150€ from the government (I'll need to wait if I even get granted that money). That's it. That's all the compensation I got. For over one year.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Of course the people around me all accept it without questioning. Without being mad about the money waste, about the ever growing restrictions, about the so called "science" they so blindly trust. They never stop to ask temselves questions.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If cloth and medical masks were apparently enough in the past against the virus, why are they now not suitable anymore? Doesn't that just prove that the previous masks were never really effective against the virus in the first place and that the ever-changing rules are just a crock of shit?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But of course the people I know don't question the logic behind it at all. They just keep clapping for and agreeing with daddy government 100%, while still blaming the ever ongoing pandemic and  lockdowns on the few "bad people" that don't follow the rules down to a T like they do.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'm surrounded by idiots...</p></p>

        <p>It’s all a scheme to discourage you into getting vaccinated. They keep playing fuck fuck games with masks rules, which in turn gets you fed up with the constant changing of rules you have to adhere to which ends with you getting the vaccine as you see it easier to deal with than having to check the new mask rules every day like it’s the weather. Good luck.</p>

        <p>This.  This is why they keep doing what they're doing.  To "voluntarily" force you to take the jab.  Dollars to donuts, once 80-90% of the population gets the jab, the virus will mysteriously disappear and so will the restrictions.  Don't give them the satisfaction.</p>

<p>Then when they changed their stance they even publicly admitted they lied to the public in order to stock up on masks for hospitals and the likes.</p>

        <p>They were actually telling the truth when they first said that masks dont work. It had been generally agreed upon that masks do nothing to stop a respiratory pandemic. </p>
<p>Why decades of science was overturned within a matter of weeks, I dont know. But I've seen Cuomo use masks as a way to blame the public. It provides government an out that they can point to as a reason why their policies fail.</p>

        <p>I have a friend who lives there and she tells me about all of these things. You'd think considering Germany's past, they'd be careful about recreating a dictatorship and I know saying that freaks people out, but come on. You are forced by the government to wear a ridiculous diaper on your face in public, and even that doesn't suffice, no, it has to be a special one. Tell me that's not a dictatorship.</p>

        <p>I'm also from Germany. Since the start of the pandemic I used 4 masks. 3 surgical masks. I wash the now and then with soup. 
And 1 FFP2 mask. 
All of them I got for free. Never paid money for that bullshit. 
I once took a test last year march because I had to. Was travelling back from Austria and they shut the borders behind us.</p>
<p>And here I am, still alive. ✌🏻</p>
