    <strong>Critical thinking regarding Covid</strong>
    <p><p>Please watch Event 201. Search on YouTube. You will not find them discussing the impact on humans and healthcare. They are solely concerned with business and protecting their capital.</p>
<p>Facts: Gates has publicly admitted to a desire to reduce global population. Gates was spotted with Epstein in early 2000s. Epstein had a BS position at Harvard. Gates is well known for financing vaccine studies at Harvard and Wuhan virus labs.</p>
<p>Epstein scandal hits July 2019. October 2019- Event 201 and Military olympics in Wuhan with 10000 athletes (healthy carriers) from 100 countries. Dec 2019 global covid spread begins. Mar 2020- now Lockdown and death.</p>
<p>Where’s the Epstein news? Where’s Ghislaine Maxwell and the evidence and lists of the pedos? Whitewashed from the news and binary division of mask vs. non-mask created during cyclical election turmoil. Diversion complete.</p>
<p>This must be a coincidence. Can anyone please spot any errors with my thought process or timeline? Thank you.</p></p>

        <p>I don't see how COVID can reduce world population. It kills mostly people who would die from anything else just as well. World centers of population growth are not where lockdown hysteria is happening. Nigeria has '110 cases' and 0 deaths today, with the population of 195 million. It's because they wear masks and practice social distancing! Check every market in Lagos! </p>
<p>Reducing Canada's population on the other hand is no rocket science at all. Dial down the immigration just a bit (from Nigeria included), and here you go. No viruses-shmiruses needed.</p>

        <p>The lockdowns themselves are the real depopulation tool. Look how many people have died because of them, because they were unable to, for example, get cancer treatments.</p>

        <p>Gates has publicly admitted to a desire to reduce global population, yes. Yes, he was spotted with Epstein (but then again so was one Donald J. Trump).</p>
<p>Neither of those two things matter. There is no evidence, as much as people would like to believe it, that Gates is doing anything criminal or even immoral to try to 'reduce global population' other than encouraging birth control and abortion.</p>
<p>That is it as far as what Gates is doing to make his dream of a reduced global population come true.</p>

        <p>I’ve pointed this out to friends, and they think I’m crazy. They believe him and hold him up to be some sort of trusted authority. His entire image is a calculated PR marketing sort of thing. That’s what all philanthropy is. Whitewashing the true intent of making money with the guise of intellect, generosity, simplicity, selflessness and altruism.</p>
