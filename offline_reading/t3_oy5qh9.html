    <strong>A Call for a Third Way</strong>
    <p><p>A few facts to start off...</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.outkick.com/year-long-media-fear-porn-has-vaccinated-people-more-afraid-to-do-normal-things-than-unvaccinated/">Vaccinated People More Afraid To Do Normal Things Than Unvaccinated</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article253258048.html">Most unvaccinated people fear vaccines are more dangerous than coronavirus</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.upmc.com/media/news/072621-king-mejia-vaccine-hesitancy">The most vaccine-hesitant group is the most highly educated</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We have a gridlock. Vaccinated people seem to believe the vaccines will protect not just them but all of society, despite <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/otihny/someone_please_explain_to_me_if_even_fauci_has/">Fauci</a> and the CDC even admitting that the vaccines don't stop cases or spreading. What does that logically leave? Severity of symptoms, hospital capacities, and deaths.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/tZ5x59y.png">Deaths in the US are not budging</a>. The difference in <a href="https://i.imgur.com/jiQDeXU.png">Florida is really not that dramatic</a>. As many of us know, they have been cooking the books for the past two years on dying with COVID (not because of it), so even these stats should be met with some skepticism. <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/">Check the stats for your state here</a>.</p>
<p>That and dubious understandings of hospital capacities (they are designed to operate at capacity, so most beds being full is not normally a problem) has made tracking exactly <em>how bad it is</em> rather difficult. Even if the 0.02% death rate of the virus doesn't scare you, having a proper statistical background helps in discussing this topic, particularly with the other side.</p>
<p>Anti-vaccinated people just want to get back to normal. Vaccinated people want to stay locked down, require masks, and/or require vaccines. As most governors are saying right now, it is <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2021/08/with-few-mandates-oregon-takes-mostly-hands-off-approach-as-covid-19-rages-in-oregon.html">simply not politically feasible</a> to demand any of that or even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/31/world/greg-abbott-mask-vaccine-mandate.html">not legal</a> entirely. To make matters worse for the pro-vaccine group, supply shortages are hitting, and the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/edfa1806-562d-4097-a154-a26dfc1bc260">WHO even called for a moratorium on boosters</a> until the third world gets more of them.</p>
<p>We need a carrot for the pro-vaccine crowd and something the anti-vax crowd will approve of. Enter the third way. <a href="https://www.countere.com/home/covid-buyers-club-experimental-coronavirus-treatments">Focus on stockpiling therapeutics that have shown tremendous potential to heal COVID patients</a>. This author claims Ivermectin plus vitamins/minerals results in about a 90% reduction in mortality (I believe a relative 90%, which is the same as the relative 90% efficacy that vaccines claim). Can we just agree to do this and pump out supply of this?</p>
<p>There's only one danger, which is that the drug lobby is powerful as hell. Once you start digging on them, you realize the COVID vaccines <em>only</em> have approval for emergency measures because there is no safe alternative. If the above therapeutics really are equivalent, then we can launch a massive probe against the drug companies, but we can <em>only</em> do it with a united front. If it becomes red vs blue, or vaxxed vs unvaxxed, then half the country will look at it like healing crystals and flat earth theory.</p>
<p>This is what I'm asking you... Come together on this. Talk to your people that you disagree with. Explain why we are here in this situation. Break this gridlock. Every day we wait is a day we lose and get poorer, and they win and get richer.</p></p>
