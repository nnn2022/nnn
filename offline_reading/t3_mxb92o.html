        <p>If you compare the covid deaths between Michigan and Texas, Michigan is only higher by 5%. And if you compare the total covid cases per 100,000 people, you get lower numbers for Michigan (9,000) than for Texas (9,897).</p>
<p>Looking at the bigger picture, it looks like Michigan and Texas are fairly similar in total covid cases/deaths now. So Michigan was playing "catch up". And because Michigan is just now catching up to Texas, one could argue that the lockdown worked for the 12 months before spring began.</p>
<p>You also have to consider the newer variants which spread faster than the old variants. That's why Michigan seems like it is in a dire situation with so many more cases than the rest of the country. They previously had lower cases, so less people were exposed to the virus. When the variants came into full effect, there were more people who were not immune to it.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I am from Michigan so I may have bias.</p>

        <p>I think the overall idea is that even if lockdowns work for a period of time, the collateral damage is significant.  Like the effects on the economy, children, mental health, etc. in places that were heavily locked down PLUS the deaths and long term impacts from COVID likely outweigh the death/despair seen in states without lockdowns.</p>
<p>One would think that if lockdowns worked, then places that didn't lock down would be significantly worse in terms of cases and deaths, but that's not the case.</p>
<p>I live in Ontario, so we are pretty extreme with our measures.  I think that you need to give people the autonomy to evaluate their own risk and make decisions for a virus that objectively has a nearly negligible risk to most people under 60 years old.  It's just odd that the government has made decisions where we are not allowed to go to a gym, or a restaurant, or play in a local sports league.  The people weren't given a choice in this and everything is done "for our safety" despite us continually saying that we don't want this.</p>

        <p>I think that is how history will look back at lockdowns. They may have worked for a short amount of time, some U.S. states more than others. But at the end of the pandemic, every state has similar total cases and deaths adjusted for population. It doesn't matter what factors led to this, whether lockdowns could have worked on paper or not. What matters is that they didn't have an effect on the pandemic in the grand scheme of things.</p>
<p>I think the governmental decisions to try and stop the spread of the virus by various means (masks, social distancing, lockdowns, etc.) were logical at the time when it was reported that the infection fatality rate was 3.4% (which it isn't today). Combined with the disease being exponentially more infectious than the typical influenza virus (based on R values), officials actually believed that a large portion of the population would die from the virus. However, with more information on the virus in different regions, these reasons for heavy measures have mostly been proven to be incorrect.</p>

        <p>Even before the lockdowns were put into place, the best research and data on the subject said that lockdowns should be the last of the last of the last of the last of the LAST resorts, only being put into place if a virus was more than 5% lethal.</p>
<p>CoVid? 0.2%... worse case. Lockdowns were never warranted, neither was masking.</p>
<p>The populace being told "Hey... take Vit. D, C and Zinc supplements and other supplements if you run low on other vitamins and minerals!" was warranted but was not done.</p>

        <p>Yea I agree that when <em>initial</em> predictions came out, COVID looked pretty scary, and even I was wiping down groceries and telling my parents not to leave the house.</p>
<p>But the data from Italy and China were known pretty early and it showed the typical outcome of mainly elderly people with 2-4 comorbidities being the highest risk, with a negligible risk for anyone under 60.  With this knowledge it was completely irresponsible to apply blanket lockdowns and continually try to scare people through the media.</p>
<p>The initial 3.4% mortality was also completely disingenuous.  That 3.4% relates to the CFR (<strong>case</strong> fatality rate) whereas the IFR (<strong>infection</strong> fatality rate) was more accurate.  The CFR is the rate of people with a <strong>case</strong> of COVID-19 (symptomatic disease) whereas the IFR is the rate of people dying with an <strong>infection</strong> from SARS-COV-2 (the virus itself, includes asymptomatic, mild, and severe cases).  </p>
<p>We were led to believe that asymptomatic cases were dangerous and major spreaders of disease, and these "cases" were even included in our daily counts for COVID.  The fact now is that asymptomatic patients spread COVID at nearly 0% and outdoor transmission is nearly 0%.  These were the two main reason why lockdowns were even done in the first place, otherwise you would just tell symptomatic people to stay at home, wear masks, and social distance until they recover.</p>

        <p>Great summary. I totally agree; clear, measured and factual health information coupled with self-responsibility would have been the best response. But governments these days prefer fear, uncertainty and doubt as it makes the population more pliable and compliant. It seems to be a theme that started 20 years ago and is only getting worse.</p>

        <p>I think that would be countered by viruses spreading more easily during the winter. Cases actually began to rise just over a month ago during warmer temperatures.</p>
<p>There are definitely lots of people doing more stuff now that it is warmer. Michigan is a cold and snowy winter state which inhibits a lot of gatherings during December-February.</p>

        <p>That’s what i meant. Harder to avoid being trapped indoors, fewer outdoor dining options etc. so without lockdown, even higher winter transmission.</p>
