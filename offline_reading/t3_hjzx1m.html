        <p>People in this sub have inquired about what the "Great Reset" is, and what it is that interested parties are seeking with the manipulation going on with the pandemic/plandemic/scamdemic, whichever you prefer to call it.</p>
<p>Dave Cullen and James Corbett have discussed this topic in the past, and the first few minutes of this video has a small summary on what the "Great Reset" is. Even if you don't buy into this theory, this video does summarize and explain the current theories on why vaccines are being pushed, the notion of political figures hoping to reset society and the economy, and so on. </p>
<p>I started off feeling like something was off about COVID, and the reactions to it from the get-go. When I was younger, I dabbled in mysteries (mostly missing persons stuff, and I'd post at /r/unresolvedmysteries for a time) and I enjoyed conspiracy theories about stuff like UFOS for fun. When I began to read up on certain subjects, and the potential motivations that interested parties may have for perpetuating and continuing the fear in the masses, a lot of puzzle pieces began to fall into place for me. Not all, mind you, but I do think something nefarious is happening behind the scenes. I really doubt incompetence can attribute to the current actions of the media and the government, especially <em>now</em>, months later when even more data is available on the virus (mind you, data like the IFR and whatnot were around even back in March).</p>
