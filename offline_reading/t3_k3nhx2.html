        <p>RT news (Russian state television), Op-Eds and Fox News (We all know why) should not be listed as "legit sources", better remove those and add some scientific papers to give it more credibility.</p>
<p>Also, why is HCQ still listed as possible treatment? It's been since proven that it doesn't effectively help against Covid. Here are a few papers as proof:

        <p>When you can't debate an argument on its merits always go after the source(s). Very obvious.</p>
<p>It's also very obvious you actually didn't read any of the HCQ links in the linkdump.</p>
<p>The evidence speaks for itself to anyone who reads it; I encourage everyone to evaluate the links in the linkdump and what you sourced and come to their own conclusions.</p>

        <p>I only stated that the three named sources can't really be seen as "legit" and that a few more scientific papers should be added instead. I never debated anything else. Idk what you interpreted there, but if this dump is legit, you shouldn't need to be so defensive about it.</p>
<p>For HCQ, please dont get me wrong. I am not against it. Anything against COVID19 is a good thing. But as I said, the effectiveness could not be proven (see the linked papers) and since HCQ can have significant side-effects, it shouldn't be used if not really needed. Also, yes I didn't read the links, mostly because most are from earlier this year where we didn't know whether HCQ really helps (besides many being partisan and or politically motivated which is a big no no), and/or are Op-Eds and thus carry low value. </p>
<p>Science is about having assumptions and proving or disproving those. And yes, HCQ seemed to be promising at first as it is stated for example in this paper https://www.nature.com/articles/s41421-020-0156-0?fbclid=IwAR00SZmlr8i4s_GeGQHBRKFHrgLy3fOEc7X5VLrC4ecfF9Yypiba6eI2EBA, but we now know that it is not helping against COVID19 as seen in the papers I linked. But hey, maybe I am wrong, so I'd be very interested if you have any recent scientific papers that show that HCQ is in fact effective.</p>

        <p>It doesn't matter the source if the content is legit. Engage with the merits, not the name of whatever webserver/domain it's hosted on.</p>
<p>&rt;since HCQ can have significant side-effects</p>
<p>This is how I know you don't know what you're talking about. Yes, it CAN but it's exceedingly rare, which is why it has been offered over the counter for decades in many countries. There's a link in the linkdump comparing HCQ to Tylenol, that might be of particular interest to you. It's a newspeak talking point that has been used to discredit HCQ, but meanwhile it's never mentioned to discredit Remdesivir or many other drugs despite those having MUCH greater frequencies of serious side effects. I encourage you to actually read the links in the post.</p>
<p>Many of the studies on HCQ were motivated by partisanship and were intentionally sunk with parameters that only someone who is deep in the weeds on HCQ treatments would be able to spot. </p>
<p>&rt;if this dump is legit, you shouldn't need to be so defensive about it.</p>
<p>I literally said, </p>
<p>&rt;The evidence speaks for itself to anyone who reads it; I encourage everyone to evaluate the links in the linkdump and what you sourced and come to their own conclusions.</p>
<p>If that's defensive then I don't think we can agree on basic facts of reality and therefore this discussion will go nowhere.</p>

        <p>&rt; It doesn't matter the source if the content is legit</p>
<p>If the source is not legit, it is very likely that the content isn't and or is trying to manipulate/influence it's readers. Of course legit sources may also not always be accurate, but that's why one should always employ media competency. My whole point was that more legit and scientific sources should be included to boost the credibility of this dump.</p>
<p>&rt; Yes, it CAN but it's exceedingly rare</p>
<p>So you basically prove my point, yet you claim I know not what I am talking about. But let's humor your thought that the side effects are rare. Even then, Why should HCQ be used if it doesn't help against COVID19? That's like taking antibiotics while having a cold. Best case nothing happens, worst case the side effects hit you.</p>
<p>&rt; Many of the studies on HCQ were motivated by partisanship and were intentionally sunk with parameters that only someone who is deep in the weeds on HCQ treatments would be able to spot.</p>
<p>That's a very bold claim, can you give legitimate sources for that?</p>
<p>&rt; If that's defensive then I don't think we can agree on basic facts of reality and therefore this discussion will go nowhere.</p>
<p>You take this out of context. I meant defensive regarding the sources which (as said before) can make the dump shine in a very bad and shady light.</p>
<p>&rt; So then how would you know anything about them?</p>
<p>Because I read the headlines and saw the URLs which caused me to not read bother to read them as</p>
<ol>
<li>Twitter and Youtube are not legit sources and only opinions</li>
<li>I don't read Op-eds because one can claim anything without bothering to back up the claims</li>
<li>I don't read politically motivated articles, because they're always skewed and manipulative towards their own goal</li>
<li>Most other articles are from the beginning of the pandemic. As I said, things have changed since then (again, read the papers)</li>
</ol>
<p>But that wasn't even the point I was trying to make and I won't go deeper into any reason because you won't listen to my arguments anyway. All I am asking for is to review the new knowledge that we have gained recently. Please for Pete's sake, read the scientific papers and make up your mind.</p>
