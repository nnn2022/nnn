    <strong>As someone who has been moderate during the pandemic: I'm done with the politicization</strong>
    <p><p>If I've learned anything during this pandemic, its that there is absolutely zero leadership ANYWHERE.</p>
<p>To think that several Hollywood movies have been made about global pandemics where the outbreak / mortality rate is WAY worse in fiction than what we've experienced and we as a society can't work to solve a problem that affects all of us, I have no hope for when / if something truly disastrous comes along.</p>
<p>Early on in the pandemic, I noticed a very distinct difference in opinion based on socio-economic status: well to do white collar individuals who could work remotely / still had a job were all for lockdowns.  Whereas blue collar individuals or business owners who relied on things staying normal adopted a "this is a hoax" mentality. I found myself alone in my opinion: "This fucking sucks, but I can't afford to give up and stop living my life. I need to adapt".</p>
<p>I think a lot of behavior on both sides is absurd. Screeching at maskless people, telling them they're killing everyone around them. Or being an abnoxious asshole to people who do decide to wear a mask despite them just minding their own business. Its exhausting. But I shouldn't be surprised. We had an opportunity to have a real grown up conversation about COVID. But living in such an entitled country like the USA, we decided to baby everyone and just kick the can down the road...</p>
<p>No one stood up and said: "In a situation like this, we have to acknowledge people ARE GOING TO DIE." I certainly don't take that lightly, and I believe other rational people don't either. I believe masks would have been the absolute perfect compomise. Something so easy that everyone could do but we had to go and fucking politicize that too.</p>
<p>And now vaccinations are headed that way as well. The media / the internet deserves most of the blame. The narrative as to what we are trying to accomplish has changed so many times that I don't fault people for becoming apathetic. It went from masks don't work, to flatten the curve, to new strains, to some infinite number of other doomsday scenarios.</p>
<p>And corporations? They have never given a fuck about you as a consumer. Mask mandates in stores have always been about mitigating the risk of litigation while not alienating customers who might feel unsafe. This is best seen when many grocery chains instituted special hours for senior citizens. A great idea to help protect the most vulnerable... until it cut into the bottom line and they got rid of it.</p>
<p>My attitude this entire pandemic has always been "do your best to make the most logical decisions for yourself and your well being". I'm fully vaccinated but I don't give a shit if people don't get it. Similar to how I didn't give a shit if people wore masks or not.</p>
<p>The people who are overwhelmingly committed to this entire situation (on both sides) who have made it a key part of their personality are not offering solutions. I, like millions of other Americans have had their lives on pause because of the pandemic and the economic &amp; social impact. The fact that the CDC is now defending its decision to ease mask restrictions is absurd. I keep seeing posts "But people will lie!" Or "I'm wearing my mask even though I'm vaccinated because people are stupid" just shows me people just want to be angry.</p>
<p>I'm tired of being angry and confrontational. I don't give a shit what other people do. I can only control me and my decisions. My aim is to help where I can.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Vaccinated. CDC says no masks. Good. You're free to choose whats best for you. Let's start building something positive in society rather than more fear-mongering.</p></p>
