    <strong>We Will Never Return Back To Normal. Normal Living Is A Thing of The Past Now.</strong>
    <p><p>Even if we manage to eradicate this "virus" through vaccinations, we can never return to normal. Not anymore. Not with the way things are headed. Because a very dangerous stage has been set, and the one that allows those in power to enact lockdowns in a moment and to take away our rights and freedoms, all in the name of collectively combatting some "deadly" disease, that kills less than 1% of the population. Yes you doomers. The survival rate of this "deadly" disease is 99.7%.</p>
<p>And if you don't comply or just voice your opinions, you are a monstrous, grandma killer with no regard for human life. Personally Idgaf. I walk in wherever without a mask, until I'm told to comply otherwise I don't want to get banned from every store. And I've gotten called a "killer" for simply not wearing a mask irl and of course, I bet you know by who. Fat and gay sounding pussy worshippers who think they will get all the chicks by being the "obedient slave" to the gov and by virtue signaling Me to wear a mask. Little do they know, they are a rope bunny to the government for free use and no wonder they all love it! Daddy government gets you off good huh? </p>
<p>You doomers are so obsessed in gaining pleasure that, you have fucked everyone's future and erased our past. Most of you don't have an ounce of logic and when anyone says the facts to you, what are your excuses? "We are nazi's who love killing people and don't have any empathy." Well, if y'all have that much empathy then tell master (government) to lock and tie you up forever because whenever you go out you also can kill grandma... even if your quadmasking. (Masks don't do shi, and that myth has been debunked thousands of times).</p>
<p>You people either virtue signal us or just straight up wish death upon us and our families for daring to complain. What's the theory behind double masking in the car while being alone? You are truly the slaves that anyone can wish to have. Your master fauci has an eye on you, wherever you go and that's why you obediently mask in your cars. Idk what hypnotizing submission thing your master has done on you, but it's totally working. </p>
<p>If we carry on down this path this new normal will become our reality. We will never see our friends or families again. Grandma and grandpa will eventually die from something other than COVID and you won't care. You won't have seen them in ages anyway. You'll have disassociated yourself emotionally from them. These fucking masks and lockdowns have left deep psychological scars on everyone. I can't even meet chicks or talk with someone decent anymore! With all these quad maskers, I feel like I'm a ring in the desert. All those fun days are gone. And police can even question you now where I live for simply going out. And for what? For a "deadly" disease of 99.7% survival rate.</p>
<p>These face-masks aren't going away. In fact, a lot of the insane moro-ns fantasize about it. But sure, if we wear the masks (which don't work by the way) they'll go "away" eventually, keep repeating that. When will the madness end? Remember you little effing doomers, this was supposed to last 2 weeks. More than a year has past, vaccines have been given out and yet the restrictions have gotten worse. You see that you blind fucking clowns! Oh I forgot you all are still blindfolded by your master Fauci and can't see through your obedience to him. Well, wake the F up. This is never going away. It was never about a virus. It was about control all along.</p></p>

        <p>Yes its hilarious how florida always had a reputation of having crazy people and nutjobs and now for the last year we might possibly be the most normal of any state in the country...never had riots or unrest, have been fully open over a year...the only differences in life is that most people wear masks and some events and places have a slightly reduced capacity (which has been nice sometimes at the theme parks and places weve been too) even when someone asks you to wear a mask its always non politically charged and asked respectfully...for a while I would just put one on if asked nicely but for the last month I finally just said enough is enough and havent been bothered by anyone once...and walmarts and publix and other grocery stores and businesses have taken all their distancing and masks signs down in the last couple weeks as the counties are actually removing the mask mandates...go figure, a government who on a state and city level is actually giving up power</p>

<p>I hope writing this made you feel better.</p>
<p>"They" can't be saved. So it's up to us to get through this as "easy" as possible and try to "enjoy" how it's unfolding. I know I'm here to experience this on a totally different level than most, but I don't know where this is gonna take me. Sometimes I worry, but most times I try to enjoy the show, because that's the only way life is a little worth living these days...</p>

        <p>You're correct. Before these crazy restrictions, I was a "enjoy the decline" guy. Now in Ontario when you can't buy simple things such as phone chargers, slippers or even a frigging pen, it truly takes a toll on mental health and since that leak, it all fks with your head big time.</p>

<p>I've been going into stores since the start of this year and it felt good however I never got told by anyone to put on a mask, I was even standing next to a masked cop in the store and he didn't say a thing about me not wearing a mask, I live in the netherlands</p>

<p>They are reflecting, they act more like nazi's forcing us to live a life we don't want to live only because their fascist/commie government says so</p>
<p>They are so demoralized they will only realize something is wrong with the system until they get the boot on the face</p>
<p>&rt;Well, if y'all have that much empathy then tell master (government) to lock and tie you up forever because whenever you go out you also can kill grandma... even if your quadmasking. (Masks don't do shi, and that myth has been debunked thousands of times).</p>
<p>They literally made the world into a global prison, they love it when people give away their freedom for security, they don't understand that giving away freedom for security you lose both or they are the ones that really are the nazi's because they hate it when people fight for freedom and they hate it when you think different, nazi's were acting like a hive mind they do too same thing act like a hive mind to "save the world from a deadly virus" same thing different world.</p>

        <p>I really notice this difference people here are obedient because they fear government while people in other countries are obedient because they fear the virus.</p>
<p>Whenever i have a conversation about this whole covid crisis I noticed people fear the government more then the virus, people are afraid to have to pay a fine, afraid to be arrested, not able to get a good job anymore for standing up against the government, afraid the government will give even more stricter restrictions if people are not obedient, it's like most people know it's all a lie but are afraid to stand up for themself.</p>
<p>Nobody even trust the government, we don't even have a real government since the elections we all might know deep inside something is not right but it's fear for the government that makes people afraid to stand up.</p>
<p>The only way we can go back to normal is if we overcome the fear of not only the virus but also overcome the fear of the government.</p>
<p>Overcoming the fear of only the virus won't stop this.</p>

        <p>The day those believers realise they were being fooled for years will be the most beautiful day of my life.When they realise how unbelievably stupid they were for wearing a mask while alone in the car or alone on the street, calling non-believers killers irl &amp; on forums like these, those who supported the idea of not seeing friends &amp; family in the name of the "good cause", those who didn't realize desinfecting hands 20 times a day weakens our immunesystem, those finding it normal people getting arrested for just sitting in a park with a few people, for just seeing a friend, for just living actually; AAAAARGHHH the monsters!!&amp; for what? Saving a few elderly that would die in a year (or 2) anyway? Now suddenly we care for them, OH MY GOD save them, care for them! A year ago 99% of ppl wouldn't even give there seat on the bus to some 80yo. OH MY GOD! People are dying! Save them!Wake up call: they are showing images of Africans dying by the millions for decades on tv  and YOU DIDN'T CARE you idiots.</p>
<p>I will cry from joy &amp; I will make fun of them all for the rest of their days! I cannot wait.It will be legendary.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, those people have been dying of starvation and all these other diseases for decades, but yet somehow, when a 75 year old grandpa who already lived his life is dying from covid with already many health conditions, that somehow gets their attention and they don't want them to die. Truly a clown world.</p>

        <p>This is exactly my biggest fear right now.  Even if somehow covid disappears (which i won't), I fear that every fall when a new flu emerges, the automatic go-to is going to be full lockdown and people will expect and accept it.  </p>

<p>If you allow the government to break the law in an "emergency," after all, they'll just CREATE "emergencies" so that they can break the law.</p>

        <p>Family life was already breaking up before this and now unless you live local and sneak to go see each other, more complicated if you have brain dead relatives who lined up for the vaccine with worries about shedding, say goodbye to the same type of relationships. My family was abusive so I am no contact. I do know if I was still in contact with them, since they are system supporters and lackeys, they would be banning me from their houses for being unvaccinated anyhow.</p>
<p>As for friends, 95 percent of them got the vacc, the majority don't know my views and I have realized I would no longer be a "friend" if they knew I was posting here. So how close am I really with these people? I posted some things that had a few friends that knew of my blog [under an anonymous name] that's probably lost me one or two friends already. </p>
<p>With husband, we have had such bad health problems and in my case, outrunning the Grim Reaper, I don't want to sign up for their death shots. </p>
<p>I do think life is permanently ruined too. If you are young and have the money to pull it off, go remote or rural or find the freest place, that's my advice. I know supporting one's self in this hellscape is not easy. </p>
<p>They are going to beat us down. They have basically ruined society where I live. I find myself withdrawing from people. What do I have to say to the brainwashed who consider me a "dangerous rebel" for refusing the vaccination [even with my extreme health problems]? There's no one to visit or talk with either. I have no one in this town, who even thinks the way I do. I was already marginalized enough, now add this garbage. </p>
<p>We focus on taking care of each other I and husband, but I know they have ruined the world. There's no social connections. I look around and ask whatever divine force there is why I was even born into this hell. We are slaves. they can pull the pandemic card out everytime the peasants get "uppity". </p>
<p>I don't see it ending either. It was designed NOT to end, with the "variants", non-working vaccines with no immunity or stopping transmissions, phoney tests--PCR, and the rest. Children and young people are being destroyed. Small business around here is destroyed. Was it worth it to these psychopaths to destroy your lives? I am already being banned from clubs, I see the future coming. I think I probably don't have much time left as a very disabled person in this hell world. I can see them rounding us all up for the camps soon. Some people think I am too much doom and gloom, but then I used to warn about shit like this coming [past conspiracy theorist] and was laughed at. Yeah add a life time of invalidation among the brainwashed.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I finally cracked and posted about my hatred for the "new normal" on facebook.  I went from an account with my real name and 1,172 contacts to one with a fake name and 10 contacts.  I actually felt good about it though.  Fewer than 1 in 100 made the cut when I decided I was done hiding how I felt.</p>

        <p>I have tried the "subtle approach" posting naomi wolf twitters and posting articles about techno dictatorship but all of that got ignored. I post a little bit on Facebook but more and more seems useless to me and I wish I had some real friends locally [have a few online] who I could really talk to. I did post against vaccine passports too. I know I am losing "friends" already even over what I posted on my blog.  I can see why you whittled things down, hope you have friends you can talk to. I don't feel the same about some people after all this.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I got intense reactions even to that.  Lots of people calling me a "conspiracy theorist" and trying to drag me kicking and screaming back to the MSM narrative reality.  The good news is that I have some awesome people IRL (both friends and family members) who are on my page, and I'm finding fun ways to meet new people.  Like last weekend, I branched out a bit and went to a living history event in Gettysburg because I love 19th century fashion, and I met some really cool people there!  One guy greeted me by saying, "we're fighting off the 'rona with whiskey and tobacco!"  Last night I went to a show and actually got people dancing with me.  I'm planning to do stuff like "Armistice" (the replacement for Pennsic), and maybe even "Renegade Man" (the replacement for Burning Man).  No time like the present to build a new social life!</p>
