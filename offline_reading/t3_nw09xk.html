    <strong>Been feeling down lately. Looking for support.</strong>
    <p><p>I don’t see how any of this can end without violence. It feels like we’re fighting against a group of people who feel righteously justified in their tyranny and are willing to attack and destroy your family, spouse, and children to push their ideals. They want their ideals accepted so badly they don’t want anyone to criticize them or even politely disagree with them in any way. </p>
<p>They’re willing to blatantly break laws and hurt people just to get their way, and they know that they won’t have any repercussions for what they do. How can you even fight that back?</p>
<p>I dunno, just felt like rambling for a bit. This last year and a half has really changed my outlook on people as a whole.</p></p>

        <p>I totally feel you on this. I feel like I am a completely different person and there's no going back to who I was before this. I have virtually no trust in anything, government, the medical community, fellow citizens Etc. Everything I thought I knew has been completely eroded. I know I'm never going to be able to see things the same way again. On one hand it's very sad and devastating but on the other I believe these things were here all along and my eyes were not opened. It's not like any of this stuff is new. For whatever reason I just couldn't see it before. I was never completely trusting there was always a protective mechanism in me but not to the degree that I have now.</p>
<p>I go through the same feelings of hopelessness that you are experiencing. But I do take solace in the fact that there are millions of other people just like us who have been woken up this year. We are not the only ones feeling like this, there are good decent people out there who are rational and have common sense and they are not happy with the way things are and they don't want what's going on either but they're not in control of what we are hearing and seeing. I don't know where you are but I think in the US there are going to be major shake-ups in our government. It's happening already. The party in the white house right now is crumbling. No Ordinary normal person wants riots or less police or forced medical procedures or forcing people to obsess about race,fender and sexuality and hate one another. Normal healthy people know this is harmful and wrong and don't want it. </p>
<p>The people who want these things are fear-based. They are caught up in a movement. Look up "asch conformity experiment"... that is what's going on with your fellow citizens right now. I do believe light is going to outshine all of this Darkness eventually. I think we have some very tough times ahead but we are going to get through this and we will come out the other side of this better for it. I feel just as down as you but I've been having moments lately where I can imagine a few years into the future when all the books and documentaries come out about this and what an absolute shitshow it was and how wrong it was. I've never felt more strongly about anything in my life. Deep in my bones I know how wrong all of this is, the response the government had to this, the vaccination propaganda, all of it. It felt wrong from day one to me. I know it's going to come out eventually and all of these people that have been going along with it will either backtrack or rewrite history as a coping mechanism for themselves or they will realize they've been played.</p>

        <p>You’re totally right. We’ve been lied to and told to believe what they say or else. The trust is gone and it feels like the veil is lifted. All of this happened because nobody has done anything or said “no”. I don’t know what will happen, but what the establishment has succeeded in doing is dividing the people. One side wants to be left alone, and the other is willing to destroy their lives for not joining their side.</p>

        <p>Look at world history.  Every 50-75 years things completely break down.  Wars.  Famine.  Economic collapse.</p>
<p>I get the feeling we're entering one of those periods now.  Those periods usually last 10 years or so and are followed by periods of prosperity.</p>
<p>Just find a way to survive until 2030 and everything will be fun again.</p>

        <p>I'm with you. A thing that I'm finding to be really upsetting is the lack of support and openness with my close friends. Close friends are supposed to be people you can talk about your ideas with and they will actually listen to what you're saying. But that isn't the case anymore... So much of what I say to them is brushed off as conspiracy. At this point I've stopped trying to reason with them. I don't understand why they don't want to at least wait to see the effects of the vaccine. Why is everyone in such a rush?  </p>
<p>My parents are on my side, but my brother and his wife got the vaccine and are encouraging my parents to get it. And now they are saying they don't want me or my parents around their baby unless they are vaccinated. And this is making my mom considering getting it, even though she doesn't intrinsically want it.  </p>
<p>It's funny how having the idea to wait on the vaccine or not quite trust it makes us the outsiders. Our world is bizarro right now.</p>

        <p>The world is a very crazy place at the moment. One thing I do myself is to not worry about things that are out of my control. I don’t wear masks unless I am in a hospital and I’ve unfortunately spent a lot of time there this last month. I have found that people can still be kind and want to talk to you and also do random acts of kindness.</p>
<p>On the flip side, Mental health issues are growing to a level where it’s unsafe. The mental wards will be full again for the non conformist, just like they was after each past reset. If you need to talk then feel free to message me and I’ll get back to you. I’ve had my own struggles with mental health and I am finally getting to a place of peace and tranquillity.</p>

        <p>Ok this is going to sound strange, but you might try reading “I, Pencil” which you can find online.

        <p>Read the whole thing. Loved it! It has a good message. What I got from it is that genius and ingenuity arise from the people regardless of governmental interference. That no one man can accomplish the things we do in the modern day due to how complicated the process of producing and manufacturing both raw materials and complex parts is. </p>
<p>There’s humility in knowing that I will never possess the know-how to make a pencil from scratch.</p>
<p>Nice essay. I’ll be recommending it in the future as a representation of the importance of a free market.</p>
