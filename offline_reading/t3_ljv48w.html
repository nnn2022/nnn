    <strong>So what made you finally wake up?</strong>
    <p><p>I think it was reasonable to be a little afraid in the being, mostly due to the unknown. But so much has happened since then, it is utterly insane at this point to believe that masks/lockdowns etc. work at all. </p>
<p>So what made you wake up? Was it the:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Summer riots that “caused no covid spread”?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Biden celebrations in the streets?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tik tok nurses dancing with fake dead covid patients?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gov’t officials locking down cities then going on vacation?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fauci saying to wear 2 masks?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>News stories saying to wear 3 masks?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Countries locking down because of one case?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social media censoring medical professional downplaying covid?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Car accident deaths being listed as covid deaths?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continued considerations of Vaccine Passports?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WHO coincidentally criticizing PCR cycle testing procedures right after inauguration, causing a plummet in daily cases?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cuomo murdering thousands of people and getting an Emmy? </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I can go on for another hour.</p></p>

        <p>I didn't need waking up because I already knew governments don't do a thing unless they can get something out of it. Even if they're right, even if the emergency is real, they'll abuse it to take what they can. The only question was what.</p>

        <p>For me there were multiple things observed from my own country (Slovakia):</p>
<ul>
<li>Discovering the fact that my country counts every 65+ yo infected as 4 cases</li>
<li>Mandatory AG test every week for every citizen with absolutely no effect on lowering the cases (some gov. analysts says that it even had reverse effect) but still you were forced to go, otherwise you risk huge fine from the police</li>
<li>All the effort focused to save 80+yo people while sacrificing education and social development of the youngest while letting financially destroy their parents - the very group of people that are the most vital part of every country</li>
</ul>
<p>Then some observing from the foreign countries:</p>
<ul>
<li>The way how the vaccination is going on some countries - they have made it voluntary, but are planing to make huge restrictions for everyone who will not take it. Even in countries where death ratio is &rt;1% they made people believe that the vaccine is the only way.  This is just unacceptable.</li>
<li>Refusing or not paying enough attention for prevention medicaments or medical alternatives for curing covid, like Ivermectin. There are already some cheap and quite useful alternatives, but it's like the narative was given - vaccines or nothing.</li>
<li>The fact how they are trying to convince you that the Covid vaccines are absolutely safe with no room for discussion or concerns. Which is according to <a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/data.html">VAERS datasheets</a> absolutely wrong. In fact they are very far from being safe. Raw data are available, see it for yourself.</li>
<li>Doomers enjoying this situation and virtue signalling how they are woke while demanding more lockdowns  and mob-hunting for those who oppose the idea.</li>
<li>And lastly, many times mentioned - covid hypocrisy in western countries</li>
</ul>
<p>Enough is enough. When you start lockdown with dozen cases and after year ends with thousands, perhaps the whole idea is wrong. Schengen is fucked, job stability is fucked, people are stressed out, kids spent 1/10 of their entire life in lockdown ... just end it.</p>

        <p>Yes it is. From 2021 we have started using a system called "Covid Automat". Whole Slovakia is divided into counties (without AG test, you are not even allowed to cross the county where you live) and every county have its indicator - from green to black. The government just recently published the methodology how they are managing the data. Here is the direct link to the <a href="https://korona.gov.sk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/covid_automat_2_2_2021.pdf">document</a> from the government page. Page 4, Regional indicators. Also our government has been purposely manipulating statistics with Active Cases, just to look better compared to different countries. If you take a look to <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">Worldmeters</a> and look at the Active Cases in Slovakia, that number is absolutely wrong. We were about to have a negative numbers of Active Cases this week, but they quickly changed the calculation method to avoid national fiasco. Here is the <a href="https://domov.sme.sk/c/22595942/koronavirus-slovensko-krivilo-medzinarodne-statistiky-o-covide.html">news article</a> about this. Unfortunately, all my sources are in slovak language, but if you are interested, you can use google translator.</p>

        <p>It was the summer riots for me, when conservatives opposed the initial lockdowns they were lambasted by the media. But when BLM did it, it was “justified”. Also churches being closed but liquor stores being an essential business.</p>

        <p>Man, not just the media. So many people I know just completely jumped on board that propaganda train and started attacking everyone that questioned it. An acquaintance mocked anti-lockdown protestors endlessly, screaming that black people are affected by the virus disproportionately and anyone who wanted lockdowns to end was racist. AT THE SAME TIME she was cheering on the BLM riots. Not just the "peaceful protests" but actively encouraging looting and not mentioning anyone's risk of covid. Blew my mind</p>

<p>Ahha!</p>
<p>I was wondering if there's a legit reason why people who have had covid have been pressed to get vaccinated as well?</p>
<p>Shurely they are immune, and the vaccine can go to someone that needs it?</p>

        <p>IMO there's no logic,it's about control and conformity. Usually,for most diseases natural immunity is way longer lasting than the vaccine immunity. There are some exceptions like the pneumococcal vaccine for pneumonia but if natural immunity is not better than the immunity from the vaccine usually they're lasting about the same.</p>
<p>Of course science died in 2020 so no one knows what we're following now.</p>

        <p>For me, it was the start of April when I started seeing more and more red flags:</p>
<p>- all these dystopian stories from the UK and Australia about elderly couples being harassed and threatened by the police for sitting by themselves at the park etc.</p>
<p>- discussions about "immunity passports".</p>
<p>- the alarming censorship of anyone disagreeing with the lockdowns or even just asking the government to pay attention to the psychological damage they cause.</p>
<p>It was then that I knew in my heart that all of this was downright evil and dangerous. The hopeless, dystopian atmosphere was there right from the start. When the mask mandate came at the end of April, right when the virus was starting to disappear in Europe, I completely lost it. I started speaking out against this insanity, and it was soon "established" that I was a selfish 5G conspiracy Nazi who wanted to kill grandma. Every single thing that happened since then has only made my feelings stronger. On a personal level, I've been feeling unbearable loneliness and despair for months on end. I lost the will to live.</p>
<p>At first, I gave the lockdown supporters the benefit of the doubt and tried to reason with them, but as far as I'm concerned, their position became indefensible back in May, when it was clear to everyone who was willing to be honest that the lockdowns were doing more harm than good, and indefensible in June, when <strong>those very same people</strong> who directed so much hate and venom towards me and others for opposing the authoritarian insanity all defended the BLM "demonstrations". At the time, I thought to myself: "oh well, at least that means we'll finally end the lockdown discussions". But those assholes <strong>went right back to defending the lockdowns and all the other dystopian restrictions!</strong> I've never seen such mindblowing hypocrisy in my entire life.</p>

<p>Many people think the media are habitual liars, they're not. Yes they do lie from time to time but it's what they leave out of their reporting that makes them criminal. They leave things out of their reports intentionally. This gives them plausible deniability if they are called out.</p>

        <p>Yes, getting the “what” from the media is usually a pretty safe bet. Usually when they report something happening it actually is happening or is at least true (most of the time). However, there’s almost always more to the story that places the facts in a more holistic context. </p>
<p>Therefore, you should be sceptical of whatever explanation the media is offering (I.e. the “why”). Explaining why something is happening is a lot harder and probably won’t be accurately explained by an easy-to-read, dumbed down, click-bait article designed to get you mad and come back for more.</p>

        <p>I will admit, from December to March I was legitimately worried. I saw the videos of people dropping in the streets of Wuhan and feared the worst. I kept hearing it took "2 weeks to show symptoms" from doctors online. Early March comes and Alberta gets its first case. "Here we go" I thought. 2 weeks goes by. Life appears normal. I had a gut feeling something was wrong. I then turned to the economy. All the central banks were printing their money into the sky. I knew then it was a hoax. The impending economic collapse/hyperinflation is what people need to be worried about. Watch people stop caring about covid in an instant when bread is $100 a loaf... Or when there is no food left on the shelves. I have a bad feeling that supply shortages are coming this year to get people to comply to the euthanization shot.</p>

        <p>I've been against this shit since the beginning. I understand how viruses work, and even early on there was a lot of evidence that the virus's fatality rate was way over hyped. Numbers coming out of South Korea showed fatality rate was about .1-1%. </p>
<p>If the media actually cared about the truth they would've reported that. </p>
<p>I always do my research and find it pretty easy to filter out the noise. There was a lot of anecdotal bullshit being spread and there still is, for the purpose of spreading fear. But honestly I never fell for this sham. I knew that it's basically a bad strain of the cold since January 2020.</p>
<p>Also they did antibody tests in NY in early summer 2020, that showed around 13% of the state had antibodies. That's 13% essentially immune, and that's not even considering tcell immunity. </p>
<p>The way they've handled this has been a big political sham. They've probably killed tens of thousands with this senseless bullshit</p>

        <p>When those professional medical organizations started saying that the BLM riots were a good thing because "racism is a public health crisis."</p>
<p>Then when the media and democrat leaders all started calling them "peaceful protests" despite the fact that I was watching videos on a daily basis of people getting yanked out of cars and kicked in the head, IEDs being detonated at federal courthouses, explosives being thrown at cops, small business owners being beaten with 2x4s.</p>

        <p>I was never afraid, but optimistic that it was only temporary because I had big plans for summer and fall. Government overreach did cross my mind, but I couldn’t allow myself to think about it. I was already going through personal issues and wanted to enjoy my freedom. </p>
<p>But I lost faith when fauci flip flopped about masks and when 2 weeks meant indefinitely. And also when the protests/riots were green lighted by medical professionals and blue checkmarks. That’s when I realized what the political agenda was. </p>
<p>And all of the subsequent events (goalpost shifts/ blocking of HCQ/ Inaccurate PCR tests) have only solidified my point of view.</p>

        <p>All of the following things happened within the span of about a month:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>my 96-year-old grandmother got COVID and never had a single symptom</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cuomo's daily Two Hours Hate conferences transformed from being about COVID cases and deaths into being "wahhhh orange man bad wahhhhh turtle man bad" whining marathons.  Blatant politicization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The very same people who spent 2 months shrieking about staying at home flooded the streets to "protest" the career criminal woman beater's overdose death.  No more crying about COVID, no more shaming people for being outside, and what's more, cases never spiked as a result of the riots.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, put 2 and 2 and 2 together.  the whole thing was undeniably a scam.  I started off in March staying at home like I "should", minimizing trips to the store, etc.  But by summer I stopped caring even the slightest bit.</p>

        <p>Years of distrusting the government let me know something was wrong immediately, so it was morbidly entertaining to watch the fuckery unfold. I think one of the most hilarious red flags for anyone paying attention was that they just had that massive several trillion dollar CARES act stimulus bill ready to go, and congress was trying to shoehorn the rollout of a digital dollar into that bill.</p>

        <p>I was very scared at first, I listen to Alt Media and some of them (Alex Jones, Amazing Polly, Liz Crokin, Lisa Haven) were warning about it in late December/Early January 2020, “the MSM is ignoring this and don’t want you to know, this is a bio weapon, they want you dead”. Quite the opposite of what was to come.</p>
<p>As months went by I saw that the mainstream media narrative didn’t add up. People dropping dead in the streets and being loaded into refrigerator trucks, didn’t equate to real life. So I knew the virus was phony. </p>
<p>Despite all that, I became sucked into another narrative going around Alternative media, that was that they need the cover story of a phony virus and lockdown to save children and arrest paedophile celebrities. Once that also checked out as a big fat nothing burger then I completely woke up.</p>
