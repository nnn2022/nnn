        <p>I wear a mask completely against my will, no comment on Biden, and I also think this unremarkable and relatively mild virus is real. Doesn’t matter if the vaccines are actually dangerous or not—we have no long term data to tell us if it is dangerous—and that fact alone is absolutely enough to “justify” your decision not to get one. </p>
<p>As far as “doing my part to stop it”? Don’t know about you, but that good will on my part was exhausted after two or three weeks. I no longer give a fuck about the virus or doing anything to stop it—or nothing special, at least, beyond my usual normal, sensible actions that I take when I am sick with other contagious illnesses. Why? Because the truth is that the virus is behaving precisely like a virus and, in reality, cannot be stopped by obeying irrational government policies. We cannot stop it all, so the continuous refrain from public officials that our naughty behavior and disobedience is why we can’t have our toys back is quite infuriating to me. Anyway, my point is that you believing that can “do your part to stop it” is almost entirely an illusion. You, along with many millions of people, have understandably been gaslit into thinking you can stop the virus when you simply can’t.</p>

        <p>Initially, sure, when we thought it was Ebola2, I could entertain that idea. </p>
<p>BUT, I think anything that's actually dangerous will make people lockdown on their own. You don't need multi-million dollar ad campaigns telling people how dangerous something is or trying to convince them to take a vaccine for something.</p>

        <p>It has been scientifically proved that wearing a mask saves you from fines and unpleasant interaction with the police. </p>
<p>So, it's understandable, why so many people are wearing them :)</p>
<p>But it has nothing to do with the spread of the virus.</p>

        <p>It’s a strange combination of options given that Biden is demonstrably in the pay of the people who launched the COVID19 biological weapon attack.</p>
<p>Regardless of the origin of the virus (almost certainly the Chinese bio weapons lab in Wuhan) it was weaponised by the Chinese when they chose to keep international travel from Wuhan going after stopping internal travel.</p>

        <p>I wear a mask in grocery stores because of peer-pressure or elsewhere when someone asks me to in order to avoid conflict.</p>
<p>I don't vote because I do not want legitimate anyone to govern over me. I want to take responsibility for my own life and my own decisions and consider governments and taxes a well organized form of crime.<br>
I think virus is another word for exosome, which are a part of how cells communicate with one another and set off complex mechanisms. I think our cells make certain viruses under certain circumstances. I highly doubt that they are contagious pathogens and think they are a microbiological symptom of respiratory-diseases rather than their cause.</p>
<p>I consider a vaccines at least a scam but fear it might be worse than just that. I see how humans are a big problem to basically all live-forms on the planet including themselves. I think that if psychopaths want to do something about that, they might be looking for methods to thin out human numbers in order to prevent them from destroying their own habitat. So I wouldn't rule-out infertility or even a slow death. Not as side-effects but the actual intention.</p>
<p>So... not quite in the same boat as you, I guess. But I'm willing to talk to everyone and don't want to create a divide due to a difference in opinion.</p>
