    <strong>If it saves just one life...</strong>
    <p><p>Let's shut down companies whose foods willfully or negligently promote obesity (the government doesn't need their tax receipts; we're saving lives...).</p>
<p>Let's end subsidy and bailouts of large companies; the money can be used to help the sick, the homeless, and the poor. They donated to a campaign fund? Tough: we're saving lives.</p>
<p>Let's trust-bust, boycott, and asset strip monopolisers like Facebook, Google, and Amazon. They rob us  of tens of millions of life hours to maximise profits. They create jobs? But lives, guys...lives.</p>
<p>Let's break down huge property development companies so everyone has a chance to control a clean and health-promoting home life. No more urban slums! They help the virus spread. They claim lives.</p>
<p>Let's prohibit pharmaceutical companies' immunity from litigation. This encourages negligence in a vital industry that should be dedicated to the preservation of life!</p>
<p>Let's boycott companies that unsustainably exploit environments that people depend on to live. This will surely drive up consumer costs? But I thought we were saving lives!</p>
<p>Let's explore links between serving politicians, lobbyists, and the arms industry and - dare I say it - the abortion industry, or companies which exploit lethal working conditions in the Third World.</p>
<p>This is what the media wants, isn't it? We must save lives, therefore all these things which cost lives have to go? What objection could they raise consistent with their stated motives?</p></p>

        <p>Also let's outlaw gay men from having sex, it's a major contributor to the community spread of AIDS. This is a progressive stance, no?</p>
