    <strong>The only pandemic is obesity/overweight, my experience</strong>
    <p><p>Honestly I just wanted to share my experience as a 14 year old, my mom got covid around February but she quickly isolated and got very sick but survived, she's overweight; my brother and my dad got sick around December and they experienced a bunch of things but survived, they are overweight; and here I am, being the only one that lifts weights, does cardio and generally any type of exercise, I am not overweight and have a pretty amazing diet, not a single symptom in all this time when living with 3 covid patients. This experience is what changed my perspective and it opened my eyes about all of this stuff, this just got reinforced when I discovered that 80% of hospitalisations by covid are of overweight people (in Mexico, in America is 70 I think) and I realised that every single image of people dying of covid that the media shares is of overweight people, but no one acknowledges this problem. Now I'm worried about my family mostly about my mom and brother because they are so brainwashed that it pains me, both of them are already vaccinated but they use double fucking mask, they are always carrying their chlorine bottle even though they already know that it doesn't even work, they continue to clean the groceries, and my brother will drop from school because he is scared about this illnesses but he will refuse to do anything about his physical form. Now they want me to take vaccine but I just don't want it because I don't need it, it serves no purpose to me, I'm not obese, I'm young and healthy, people think that everyone should so people don't die "because of you" but why should I care about them if they don't care about their own health?</p></p>

        <p>The CDC actually mentions how people who are overweight/obese are at greater risk in their COVID info. There’s been research, people have been encouraged to worry about their weight regarding COVID and literally every disease.</p>
<p>Also, ngl, you should wash your vegetables and fruits regardless of a pandemic lol</p>

        <p>Nah I'm fat and I had COVID and was totally A-okay as were the vast majority of fat people who got it. The reason there is a high correlation with obesity and overweight is that obesity and overweight are ALSO correlated with a bunch of other comorbidities and with advanced age. But being fat in itself isn't a reason to be paranoid and neither is one minor condition like hypertension or whatever. We have to stop buying into the narrative that the 70+ percent of overweight Americans (and close in other countries) are all at risk from COVID. They're not.</p>
