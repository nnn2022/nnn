    <strong>UNPOPULAR OPINION-Talking about "satanism", "new world order", "agenda 30", "don't get the vaccine" at protests is in fact counterproductive to ending covid restrictions. ADVICE ABOUT PROTESTING</strong>
    <p><p>After going to the London protest today I realised something-</p>
<p>The reason being is that, even if you genuinely believe it to be true, it WILL fall on deaf ears.</p>
<p>I respect your opinions.  But the MOMENT you start talking about any of the above, the people we are trying to message to at protests (the general public) will turn away.</p>
<p>We all have different reasons and opinions as to why we are against covid restrictions and or/vaccination/vaccine passports.</p>
<p>But we all have one common purpose here-to stop any future lockdowns, remove unneeded covid restrictions.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the most productive thing we could do would simply be to emphasise 3 common things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Covid has a fatality rate now of 99.9% (Delta). This is similar to that of flu. The information from this comes from Public Health England.</li>
<li>Lockdowns and vaccine passports are in violation of human rights.</li>
<li>Lockdowns and vaccine passports set a very dangerous precedent regarding loss of bodily autonomy.</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Other things to take in mind</p>
<ol>
<li>About 88% of adults in the UK have had at least one dose of the covid vaccine. 'Don't get the vaccine' or 'the vaccine is poison' and so on and telling the majority of the public  they are going to die horribly in other words is going to turn them away, because no one wants to be told they could be harmed/die.</li>
<li>TALKING ABOUT THE COVID VACCINE SIDE EFFECTS WILL THUS ONLY SCARE THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE INTO BEING PRO-LOCKDOWN/PRO COVID RESTRICTIONS.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most important thing is to not make this about vaccines whatsoever. Perhaps don't even mention them, if you feel they are very dangerous. There's way too much shit throwing between covidiots and antivaxxers. The may even be part of the 'conquer and divide' strategy of the government. Don't play into it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Don't make people feel stupid about believing the mainstream media. In fact, don't mention anything to do with the media at all. Even though it is obvious to many people that the media has been exaggerating and lying, the reality is that most people do not like to feel stupid for being told that what they believe in is a lie.</li>
</ol>
<p>4.Calling people 'sheep' at protests and insulting them is the fastest way to get them to hate you and what you stand for.  Don't use the word 'revolution' either, it scares people off. Nor 'wake up people,' it sounds very condescending.</p>
<p>5..What we are ultimately asking for now is freedom of choice. Look, I don't like the fact that the covid vaccines are probably going to be offered to children without full clinical trials being conducted either. It seems awful, and just very unnecessary. BUT at the end of the day, bodily autonomy goes ALL WAYS.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Making this about partisan politics/specific politicians (e.g. Trump, whether or not you support him) just confuses the 'no covid restrictions' message. Even something like 'Jail Matt Hancock' is counter productive. I hate him, but we are all talking about ending covid restrictions first, not seeking revenge on specific politicians. We need to prioritise. If we need to hold trials for medical scandals, let's do it immediately AFTER we've made sure we're not getting imminent lockdowns/vaccine passports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AVOID BUZZWORDS. By this I mean 'plandemic', 'casedemic', 'covidiot' etc. People have no idea what this means, or feel insulted by it.  E.g if you want to talk about the issues in PRC testing specifically, hold up a sign saying 'PRC has a false positive rate of X. Source- Y.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Other advice</p>
<ol>
<li>Talk to the public. This is what I did at the protest. Hold up a sign, calmly walk amongst people, make eye contact, smile, SAY THE PROTEST IS AGAINST COVID RESTRICTIONS AND FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, answer their questions, do not be abrasive. Make sure the people who are sat at cafes/restaurants etc actually know what the protest is about (you would be surprised how many don't.)</li>
<li>If people jeer, insult, or otherwise mock you, simply be polite, smile, maybe even wish them a good day, and leave. You need to present yourself as the reasonable one.</li>
<li>Dress and speak well. Have your argument that we need to end lockdown/covid restrictions prepared before you go. Make it short . e.g. "I am against further covid restrictions because they are against human rights."</li>
</ol>
<p>You don't have to wear a suit or anything ridiculous like that. But unfortunately, people often respond more to how you say something and what you look like.Just make sure you wear clean clothes, don't wear anything 'beach ready' (sorry topless dudes/bikini girls-great eye candy, but not for a protest). E.g.. jeans/chinos and a t-shirt for men, the same for women or a nice dress/skirt etc.Don't wear a costume-even if its funny, the time for a joking protest is long gone. Even you, doomsday toilet roll prepper man, as hilarious as you are.</p>
<p>4.DON'T USE A PROTEST AS AN OPPORTUNTY TO GET DRUNK OR HIGH WITH YOUR MATES. I like a good time as much as anyone, but this is too serious. We need to present ourselves seriously. Arranging a night out straight after the protest is a better plan.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Again, if you disagree with anything I say, I entirely respect that.</p>
<p>But I am a relative outsider to the anti-lockdown, anti-covid restriction movements, given that I'm a young person who is also an old school 'live and let live' leftist (don't hate), who has spent quite a lot of time in the very academic circles that are now being used to justify covid restrictions.</p>
<p>I feel I thus can provide a certain view into how you might appeal to a more mainstream audience, if that is the right way of phrasing it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>TL DR- I respect everyone's opinions, and all sides of the political spectrum, but I'm genuinely concerned that talking about certain theories/non-mainstream possible reasons as to why we are finding ourselves in this situation is alienating the general public and politicians.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>OPTICS ARE IMPORTANT.</p>
<p>DO NOT PLAY INTO THE MAINSTREAM NARRATIVE. THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION IS TO STATE WHAT YOU WANT TO HAPPEN, NOT THEORISE AS TO "WHY" SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED.</p></p>

        <p>Well said, the best way to pass a message is to say it with one unified voice. It is difficult to do this because as you've said people are attending these protests for various reasons. Maybe some of the organizers can help out with this?</p>

        <p>I've long said we need an organised movement. Maybe Big Brother Watch or Liberty UK?</p>
<p>I think we need to organise as in PROPERLY organise. Like American Civil Rights level of organisation, and holding legal cases against lockdown/vaccine passports too.</p>
<p>We need to have set slogans ready e.g. 'No future lockdowns', 'protect human rights' (basic I know, but hey, we can work on this later.</p>

        <p>I agree with you OP, you are advocating smart activism. However, it overlooks that many people are driven by the promotion of symbolism that indicates alliance with something larger than themselves. </p>
<p>Much of political change is trench warfare but people don't like fighting in the trenches, FYI.</p>

        <p>Again, I want to emphasise that I'm not saying either way that such things are wrong/factually correct.</p>
<p>My point is we are against 'the new normal'. That is, covid restrictions. We need to make this clear and make this message as accessible to the mainstream public as possible.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but the vast majority of the public just don't want to hear about the information in such videos, and they never well.</p>
