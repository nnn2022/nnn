    <strong>Convince me, please</strong>
    <p><p>"I ain't gonna make it," I said that a year ago and have felt it every day since last March. As the third "lockdown" here has just begun, I feel this sentiment even stronger and it's almost scaring me. And comforting me. Which scares me.</p>
<p>Thanks to the COVID Fairy (that b*tch), I've lost my job, became clinically depressed/su*cidal, and consequently lost my friends, my faith is down the toilet since the Churches closed, I can't leave the house because masks (worn and/or seen) trigger the sh*t out of me so I'm pretty much a shut-in now. And the happy pills cocktail isn't making a big difference.</p>
<p>I have what I need to off myself. At the same time, I also have a pdoc I Zoom with each week. The only person I talk to now, really (other than my shadow). I don't belong in any kind of New Normal and can't do another minute of this hell, especially for years!? My new normal is killing me but not fast enough. </p>
<p>I don't buy the infectious threat (at least not to the majority of the population) and don't see TPTB suddenly lifting the chains any time soon. The Plans are clear; it's just a matter of time, non?</p>
<p>I ain't gonna make it. And I'm not sure that I mind. I am tired of the dread and would love to either feel better or just not feel at all. <strong>Permanently</strong>.</p>
<p>PLEASE convince me I'm wrong. I really am trying to better myself and am fighting to stay positive and out of MSM as much as possible. It's quite a lonely existence. I know that's what They want. I just don't have it in me to fight. </p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>(And thanks, everyone, for this sub in general - a tiny crack letting in an even tinier ray of light)</p></p>

        <p>I've turned to God more than ever. Read His word, have the bible enter your heart. Everything is in the Gospel, read it, you will find peace, comfort and love. You will get through this, God is going to help you. Reach out for prayer, many, including me, will pray for you. Seek God yourself and He will draw close to you and you will have a rock as your foundation. Don't let them win, you giving up gives them victory. You gaining God gives you victory. Pray!</p>

        <p>You can only get into heaven by accepting Jesus Christ as your savior and Lord. That means you give your life into following his commandments. </p>
<p>The good news is that all the commandments are meant to protect you from the evils of the world and they allow you to see truth.</p>
<p>Jesus wants you first to have faith and love for Him and the Father (God) and then to treat everyone with love, respect, and a good heart. </p>
<p>Next, also very important, avoid sin, stealing, lying, doing harm to others or your body (destructive acts like promiscuity, drugs, etc.).</p>
<p>As you probably alrleady know, we are in a spirutual battle, the people doing this are controled by satan, there is no other explanation right? They are full evil, so if evil does exsist, that means the bible was right. The best part is though that God prevails and saves those who love Him. </p>
<p>Bill gates and these others want to murder and destroy everything because they are run by satan. But they can only destroy flesh, God is the only One that can destroy both flesh and soul, and He will save your soul if you accept Him.</p>

        <p>Thank you xxx I feel like a Christian in my heart and I try to be a better person but I'm not baptised and sometimes I worry that if I don't, I won't be accepted. It's hard for me to believe I would be accepted full stop to be honest, I'm not that bad but I'm not good either.</p>

        <p>Once you ask God, through Jesus, to open your eyes and give you a Christian heart, you will be shown the truth and the light. The earth (as you already see) is controlled by satan and is nothing but lies, they lie that God doesn't exist, and that you must worship them. </p>
<p>Why do you think Christians are always the government's of the worlds biggest enemies? Because we see the truth. If you want to be washed of your sins (we all have sins, every single one of us) you can get baptized and God will wash them all away through the sacrifice and death of Jesus on the cross. Baptism is a free gift for you to make you a new person, you can go have it done once God leads you to it!</p>

        <p>Buddy you listen to every goddamn word i say. Now I was born in '98 in North Carolina to a rough world. A world were Yankees push there every agenda upon me and my brothers and sisters. Us southern folk have been pushed around like garbage and the bad blood from the Civil War still runs through us all. Yet we still muster our strength to fight onwards towards those pearly gates. Tell me brother why are you gonna help the enemy and betray your brothers? Your better then this, fight til your last breath just like I have. Just like my father has. Just like his father did. Dixie blood runs through my veins and I won't spill it on Yankee land. Don't let these fuckers drag you down man, I want to see you by my side standing against these fuckers who think they can tell us what we can and can't do. Don't take your life, make them take it from your cold dead hands. You can message me any time you need to talk, I've had suicide attempts before too when i was younger but the good Lord gave me another chance and maybe it was so I can save you. Please don't hurt yourself, that's exactly what them damn Yankees want and I am tired of losing brothers and sisters. I beg you</p>

        <p>Thanks. This sister - your "nice" neighbour from the North - is so jealous of Americans right now. Years ago, the ranting about fighting for freedoms just seemed too rebellious and aggressive. We Canadians didn't need to settle our differences with war... blah blah blah... </p>
<p>I'm not going to hurt myself before reaching out one last time, but I can't do it anymore!!! I have nothing left of me and nothing left to hope for.</p>

        <p>Listen to me ok? Your gonna make this through just right ok! It ain't matter where you born you a Dixie in the soul ok. That makes you my sister no matter what. Nations don't divide Dixies from one another. You're gonna fight this through one way or another. Maybe set your sights down south here in America! Plenty of folk round beer love Canadians, can't get enough of them. You'll fit right in snug as a bug in a rug I assure you. But please, don't give up. Speak to me if anything else. I don't want to lose a Dixie soul whether your 1000 miles away or right outside my porch swing. You got the rebel soul in you, that's what brought you here. You ain't let no body tell you how to live your life. You ain't a Yankee so stop acting like one! You're a good Ole rebel just like me and my Dixie kin! You fight for that freedom, you fight for survival. I don't care about you being dramatic. I want you safe. So set your eyes to southern pride and come to the USA! That's a dream every American can relate to.  Work for that goal, feel the rebel soul inside you. Show me the proud Dixie I know you are! But please if nothing else don't hurt yourself. I beg you. I've lost too many friends this way I ain't losing you</p>

        <p>I am not going to lie to you. It is not going to get any better. As a matter of fact, it is probably going to get worse before you see any ray of light or gets better. However, you have several choices here to decide.</p>
<p>Do you commit suicide and end it? That is the easy way out! For sure, you won't have to worry about having to deal with these instigators, and have to worry about what you're going to eat for breakfast tomorrow. Sure, no problem, you can do that. However, if you do that, the folks running the scam will be laughing at your expense, and you'll be a hash tag. Your hash tag will represent another victim on their wall, another victory for them, easily gained without having to lift a finger.</p>
<p>Your second option, is you fight back any which way you can and make a stand! This is the hardest part. Me, personally? I wouldn't give these fuckers, the people instigating this "pandemic," the satisfaction of being an obituary in the newspaper or a hash tag on Twitter, having them laughing their asses off at your expense saying to themselves, "we got another to commit suicide, and we didn't have to lift a finger!" Fight back any which way you can by living. Your will to live will tell these fuckers that they're going to have to try harder, much, much harder. Understand this about the enemy, they want you to give up. What the enemy does not understand about you is that you have people here who are rooting for you.</p>
<p>Live today so that you can keep fighting for tomorrow!</p>

        <p>Do you have a garden? If you have even a little bit of backyard space, make a garden. Grow some herbs and veggies and some plants that look cool. Tend the earth and grow things.</p>
<p>If you're lonely, get a dog and take him for walks. If you're "triggered" by seeing people wearing masks, harden up. I really mean that. It sounds like you're obsessing too much over what other people do, at the expense of yourself. </p>
<p>You're on "happy pills"? At best they are just a temporary fix for your symptoms, but it sounds like they're not even working, so you're just disrupting your bodily chemistry for no reason. Get some exercise, just grit your teeth and do it, it's not that hard and you need to stop being so sensitive about other people wearing masks. It's bad enough that they're succumbing to the bullshit, you don't need to let yourself be dragged down.</p>
<p>Get in touch with your mates. Even just send them a text message. If you miss your church, surely your priest has an email address you can use to reach out to him? If you're isolated, use the time to work on yourself. Fix your diet. Try the Wim Hof method. Don't be lazy, this is what contributes to your sadness. </p>
<p>It's good to keep on top of current events and so on, but don't make your entire existence revolve around it. Get off the internet for a bit. Not just the MSM but all media. Don't get locked in an echo chamber - go outside instead. Nobody is going to come along and magically fix your problems for you - it is up to you to put in the effort. Stop telling yourself you won't make it, this is a cop out. You could be happy, and it's worth trying rather than just giving up. Giving up is just a waste of life, don't let it happen to you.</p>
<p>You'll get through this m8.</p>

        <p>I don't want to be argumentative. I'm grateful for your words, really!</p>
<p>I got a cat. I tried going back to school. I love to garden but can't this year because I can't go into shops with no mask; and all of my mates were from the Church. They just don't get it and I understand why they wouldn't. The Church is a big ugly can of worms but I did try to hole on to it for as long as I could once it closed last year. I just wasn't/am not strong enough. I've spent the past year trying to find goodness and positivity even when it's been so bleak.</p>
<p>Outside is not an option - the sight of masks triggers PTSD I didn't realise I had before COVID. I can't wear one or see one. I barely look out the window. I had a great balcony garden last year.</p>
<p>Thank you for telling me it's a copout thinking I won't make it. I'll let that simmer a while but it might be just what I needed to hear.</p>

        <p>Convince you?  No one is going to be able to convince you of anything until you're open to it and at that point, the effort to convince you will be unnecessary because your mind will already be changed.</p>

        <p>I'm really not sure how to say any of this, because it's not a subject I understand well, but I'll try.</p>
<p>I know you mentioned that you have difficulty praying now because of previous abuse within a church.  That's unfortunate, because faith in God is a powerful thing in hard times and is one of the few things that was really able to quiet my soul during some of the more disquieting parts of the last year.</p>
<p>It really is the only advice I can give in good conscience.  Just know that you are not alone, and don't ever give up.  I can't really speak authoritatively on the subject of suicide at all, nor of your personal experiences; all I can do is offer what has had a bolstering effect on me.</p>
