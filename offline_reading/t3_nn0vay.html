    <strong>False Retreat</strong>
    <p><p>I walk into this reopening fully expecting to rug to be pulled at any second. This is a thing now. We lock down the whole world for any reason and any number for any cold, flu or variant. There is nothing to stop them.</p>
<p>We are fully prepped. If they had not eased up they would have lost ground but they are too good at this game. This is a false retreat. There is no reason for them to fall back we have done nothing but lose. No one exposed them. Any one who dared was discredited and even blamed for the pandemic. </p>
<p>They have us in a great position. The next lockdown will make everyone here extremely angry and radicalized. The exact same thing will happen to the covid devout. ‚ÄúThose anti vaxers are the reason we have to lockdown AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!ü§¨‚Äù  There extreme emotion will make them incapable of rational thought, incapable of remembering the ‚Äúold normal‚Äù.</p>
<p>We are fully entranced. ‚ÄúWhen I snap my fingers you will rip each other apart.‚Äù</p></p>

        <p>The best thing we can all do is prepare for house arrest, or better, escape for a year or two if we can manage. Work out jobs, get side hustles, and have a safe house/fallback somewhere where they don‚Äôt care to reach us (middle of the desert, middle of the woods, in the mountains) basically, stay in a house in the wilderness wether you or a friend owns it. It‚Äôll leave the Covid cultists to live in an echo chamber, sure, but at least we‚Äôll be able to live our lives without interference.</p>

        <p>This past year has been a test to see what they can get away with, and how different countries/regions react.</p>
<p>Yes there have been protests, "I'm awake!" type social media posts, and a few experts &amp; politicians standing up, but by &amp; large the powers-that-be have got away with it. The powerful have shown their power and gained more, and the wealthy have gobbled up more wealth at the expense of the poor.</p>
<p>As per Icke's "totalitarian tip-toe" they will back off just enough to ease some pressure, form new plans based on these reactions, then come back harder. As to when &amp; how - who knows, but they still have plenty of cards up their sleeves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unleash new "variants"</li>
<li>Turn vaxxed against unvaxxed by locking down again after that brief taste of sweet freedom, because of their "selfishness"</li>
<li>An online "virus" that will necessitate internet lockdowns</li>
<li>Demolish supply chains and ration food &amp; water</li>
<li>Ban meat &amp; push artificial substitutes</li>
<li>Dim the sun</li>
<li>Fake an alien invasion</li>
</ul>
<p>For all the social media talk of "they won't get away with this" - so far they pretty much have.</p>

        <p>It 100% will be. People are tired of this shit &amp; are going to go do things in the summer. Last year all the vacation money went to Mexico or the States that were not tyrannical dystopias. So, this year more want that $$$$$!!!!! </p>
<p>However, as soon as flu season hits, all will be "Covid" &amp; they will lockdown again. The claim will be "not everyone was vaxxed" &amp; "variants". Then "a miracle!!" there will be a new 'booster' shot. </p>
<p>How many new billionaires will that one create?</p>
