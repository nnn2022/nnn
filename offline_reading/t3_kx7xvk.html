        <p>Nobody in their right mind would travel 250 miles to their second home just for better WiFi, he was clearly there for a vacation and in that case doing that while everyone is locked down... he can fuck right off</p>

        <p>I am not a finance director, mid level operations myself... not a big shot - but I did travel 20 miles to from my tiny old apartment to my newly purchased house (first time home owner) while I was renovating for better cell service to take work calls during the lockdown last spring.  </p>
<p>It was also great to have a little space from my wife and bang a few nails during down time.  </p>
<p>Travelling 250 miles to a second home is a different story, but I don't think it is 100% implausible.  </p>
<p>But who cares, say he was on vacation.  The real question is, did he break the "rules."  Is this a "rules for thee, not for me" situation?  Does a finance director make the rules?  Does a finance director enforce the rules?  I doubt it.  </p>
<p>I do not see any hypocrisy here.  Just a well off person breaking the rules, same as anyone else.  If a poor person travelled to a camp ground to go hunting and fishing for a week by themselves and got busted for breaking the rules it would not be news.  No one would care.  Why do we care about a finance director?  Little chip on the shoulder, anyone?</p>

        <p>The scoop is that he works for Cobra Biologics who are making the AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK and should know better.</p>

        <p>Apparently I can't read lol.</p>
<p>Ya then there is definitely a sense of entitlement.  But I would also argue the vaccine manufacturers are in it for the money and they prob don't care about the rules.  </p>
<p>However, I want to know if big pharma is lobbying for lockdowns and / or lobbying against research into low cost treatment using existing medications and methods.  If they are, and their employees are breaking the rules they are pushing for in the name of profit, there is a level of hypocrisy and people should take note.</p>
