    <strong>My best friend refuses to see me</strong>
    <p><p>I'll preface this by saying my best friend and I have known each other for 15 years, and we grew up together, went to the same school, all of that. She truly is one of my closest and most trusted friends. </p>
<p>Now, her father has asthma, so he is textbook vulnerable when it comes to covid. Otherwise he is very healthy, he weightlifts and keeps pigs and chickens on his croft and is always into some project or other. Not someone who 'should' die of something like that, in otherwords. Knowing that, I put aside all my feelings about the wider situation in order to be respectful of her and her family's wishes; there have been several opportunities to see them in the last year, but only if I went to their homes (she lives with her boyfriend several hours away from her parents). Typically I would go down on the train to stay with her for a week a few times a year, and she would come and have dinner at my house any time she was up visiting her parents. Sometimes I would drive the hour and a half to have dinner with the three of them instead if she wasn't feeling up to driving herself. Every scenario would involve her dad being put at risk, so we didn't do those things this year. The last time I saw or spoke to her was in May when I went for a walk with her, her mother and their dog along a mountain trail, and I haven't seen a single friend since then. Even then she was hesitant to hug me.</p>
<p>I'm desperately lonely, and last week she messaged me saying we could meet in town this coming Tuesday and go for a walk along the river. I was really excited to see her, and I had her Christmas presents ready to give her. Last night, she messaged me again cancelling it, because she got word of a hospital consultation (for surgery she needed) in mid-January and she 'doesn't want to risk it.' </p>
<p>I live in a place with less than 100 people, I only leave the house once every two weeks on average, and I've been nothing but careful the whole time, as I always have been honestly. The aforementioned town is only 1k people, and there hasn't been one confirmed case there this whole year. I really don't understand this. Walking outside with me presents next to no risk, and I'm incredibly hurt that she has fallen for the hysteria so badly that she no longer trusts her best friend to be respectful and clean. I don't really know what to do about it. If I say anything, she might double down thinking I'm being rude and I risk ruining our friendship, and if I don't, it may well decay and die from lack of communication. She ha ssaid she won't consider seeing me until March or 'if they start letting people see each other again.' It's so disappointing... Does anyone else have similar stories to tell?</p></p>

        <p>I'm so sorry. I had a friend who doesn't even want to be friends with me anymore because I won't wear a muzzle. Thankfully, my best friend agrees with me that this is stupid, but she still lives in her parents' house and they're super picky about this because they "don't know where I've been and I could be contaminated." It's just freaking sick. I'm so sorry. I've lost friends over this as well and I feel extremely lonely because no one wants to see me all because there's a virus out there. Now, that thing with my best friend, it's not her fault, it's her parents' but for a friend themselves to say that to you, it's just plain cruel.</p>

        <p>It's so concerning that people are being conditioned to view fellow healthy humans as walking plague rats, not to be trusted. And somehow worse that many of them actually abide government directives without once thinking about it. How many close relationships have been destroyed this year? It boggles the mind to imagine. I am sorry you lost friends too. It is nothing but cruelty, something I bet a lot of us never expected our closest loved ones would inflict on us.</p>

        <p>Something I can say about it is that it's revealed to me that some of my friends I'd rather not be friends with anymore and I'd rather have the right friends than lots of the wrong ones if you get what I mean. The true friends of mine have stayed by my side. It's sickening to see how people are with this. there are people who meet in empty parking lots just to see each other and then stand 10 feet apart. It's sick, if you have so little trust and so much fear for your own friend, then you're not friends.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry to hear mate , this whole scenario is driving people crazy . I think that part of COVID-19 is making people unhappy.As we are coming into a new era of our age and of the universe, making people miserable and fearful is/will slow down any advancement we are having as a human race.  People under control with fear is a result with your friend . I've seen it in my friends and family also.  Hang in there mate ! You're not alone , as I feel as you do and many others.
It's always darkest before the dawn. 
Be strong.</p>

        <p>Thank you, I agree. There are people and forces out there who benefit from negative energies. The fear and misery worldwide as a result of this are a feast for them. And there's the plain old psychopaths that get off on it as well. A sad state of affairs, with darker times to come. I only hope that when we come out the other side, we can rebuild something better for our children.</p>

        <p>Sorry, sucks that you're going through that.</p>
<p>My best friend won't see me either, haven't seen her since February. I don't have many friends so it really leaves a hole when I can't see the few I do have, especially since I've known her since I was like 5. She's the sweetest, most gentle person I've ever known. Then a month or so ago she called me and all anti-maskers assholes who don't care about anyone but ourselves. I swear, I don't know what to make of this whole situation. She barely talks to me anyway cause she refuses to carry on a conversation over text, but since then it's just gotten really awkward.</p>

        <p>Yep, I don't understand how people go so overboard with this. Like I have plenty of flaws, but the one you're gonna take issue with is that I don't wear an ineffective mask? She doesn't even have anyone with conditions that put them more at risk, I've seen her parents more this year than she has. It's just sad all around.</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry about that :(</p>
<p>Everyone deserves friends and to actually see them in person.</p>
<p>Loneliness is a killer. Personally I think you need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be blunt with your friend and tell her that you are feeling down and lonely, that you really value her friendship over the years and now you need her more than ever, that you understand her concerns but that you are really upset about her cancelling your meetup and that you are asking as a friend to meet up with her in person. If she doubles down then you can always try putting on the tears and make yourself appear vulnerable (may or may not work). </li>
<li>Look for some sort of backup plan for expanding your social circle. I know that must suck living in a small town but surely there must be something that you can do to meet other people even if it is scary?</li>
</ol>
<p>I understand what you mean about friendships decaying, I have seen it happen, especially when a friend has a significant other like your friend. Sometimes you have to take a risk and push things and take a gamble. But it is never good when the status quo means you are losing out in a friendship, it has to happen be a friendship in both ways.</p>
<p>It's strange in a way I feel lucky, I have always been a very solitary person with not many friends. Exactly two friends for the last few years and one of them lives hundreds of miles away so I hardly ever saw him. But luckily my best friend who lives nearby who started off pretty doomerish quickly came round to a more balanced point of view after a month or so with little input from me. We have been seeing each other every few weeks in person, even though there isn't much to do with everything being closed, it makes such a difference to go for a walk and talk to someone in person. It just lifts your spirits and makes you believe in humanity again.</p>
