    <strong>Death of young Thai policeman after Covid-19 vaccine -- family requesting inquest</strong>
    <p><p>Another young Thai has died, this time a police officer, after being given a Covid-19 vaccination -- although, at the moment, Thai authorities are not saying which vaccine (likely to be AstraZeneca, which is being manufactured by a company owned by the Thai king, and anything even DEEMED against the Thai king is banned under the country's strict human rights-violating lèse-majesté  law).</p>
<p>His family are now asking for an autopsy as they believe the vaccine caused his death.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, more than 35 other deaths after vaccination have been reported in Thailand (there are likely to be more that aren't being officially talked about by the Thai military junta government). </p>
<p>12 of them have already been ruled 'coincidental'. </p>
<p>Shocker, eh?</p>

        <p>Have family in Thailand. Many Thais will not get vaccinated now, due to mistrust of vaccines. Plus Thailand only has the worst choices -- AstraZeneca or the dodgy Chinese Sinovac vaccine.</p>

        <p>Most of the 'educated' are getting vaxxed without second thought, they just follow the VACCINE = GOOD assumption without knowing anything. Sinovac is your get out of jail free card if you have to get a vaccine, as its not some fully experiemental bullshit. A lot of educated have some western fetish where they are assume all the 'western' vaccines are good. The insane people have already flown to the states to get infected with moderna and pfizer.</p>
