        <p>I actually think it goes a little deeper than that. From what I can tell, the mask and lockdown and we're all going to die circle jerkers seem to have a very similar personality. At least in their writing. They seem like people that likely don't get out much when there isn't a make believe pandemic. And, if they do, they likely don't do well in social situations. </p>
<p>The pandemic and the doom and gloom allows them to connect with one another. They seem to enjoy the dramatics and chaos together. These are people that seem disappointed when something positive happens or when positive news is reported. </p>
<p>The bottom line, we seem to be dealing with people that probably don't have much to do when they wake up most days. The daily pandemic antics gives them something to look forward to every day. They need a connection with others, like most of us, and the Rona gives them that. I think they are scared to death of all the make believe coming to end, because they fear losing the one thing that has allowed them to connect with others, the thing that has allowed them to feel like they are finally part of a group.</p>
<p>That, or they are all just a crazy bunch of wackos.</p>

        <p>This is very true too, it's a novel thing, a novel virus, could this be the apocalypse we've all been waiting for? Is it happening in our lifetime? Has there ever been a national crisis during any other decade? Not in my lifetime. Only that one major pandemic. Maybe this will be as bad as that. Maybe I'll never have to go back to that cubicle where I wasted 20 years of my life for a company that sells bic erasers. Maybe I'll survive this, but only if I act like a hero and follow all the rules, braving the public breathing to get groceries, donning a rag and literally saving lives. Mocking anyone who doesn't see that we could literally all die of this. Do whatever it takes to avoid that most horrible death ever. After this is all over (two weeks? A month? Six months? OK now...) after it's all over and no one I know has died (thanks to my heroism) my coworkers and I will celebrate our heroic deeds with a drink at the pub, wait that went out of business and my office is shut down? OK, I'll work at home staring at a screen forever and only see my two friends and wife if the government allows that again ever. My life still has meaning because as long as we have one case I am doing my part to stop the spread. I'm saving grandma as she dies alone from cancer wearing a mask in a nursing home where I abandoned her.</p>

        <p>This is an impressive STRAW MAN... man! The underlying insecurities it reveals about your own position, honestly, aren't helpful when it comes to strengthening said position (i.e., why lockdowns don't perform as described and why fear alone shouldn't dictate so much decision-making). You already know that the person you describe above is a hyperbole. And that the person doing the describing is hyperbolic. We need accurate representations of the other side, not easily-struck-down straw men, or else we look like fools swinging at shadow puppets. Like, guilty of the same thing we accuse DOOMERS of doing with this virus. Look in the mirror, then come back here and let's get constructive.</p>

        <p>That's exactly right. That's why they're called doomers. They're people who are very, very lonely and very bored and who have spent the majority of their lives glued to some fictional work no matter the medium. Whether it be TV, movies, or books, their lives are completely imaginary, and they have few real-life connections and responsibilities to attend to, so it becomes exceedingly difficult for them to relate to the real world.</p>
<p>That's why they're always so polarized. Shut down everything! Everyone must wear masks! Everyone must stay home! Curfew at 6 PM! The reason is they really don't understand how the real world works outside of video games, where things like that are possible.</p>

        <p>Look, I feel you on this rant, but I think we should also hold each other to account. Imagine your buddy's best Ace Ventura voice: "If willywonkablows56 is indeed an anti-doomer, as (s)he claims to be, then my friend, (s)he is suffering from the WORST CASE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL PROJECTION I have ever seen." Read on...</p>
<p>I actually think it goes a little deeper than that. From what I can tell the anti-mask and anti-lockdown and this-is-just-a-flu circle jerkers seem to have a very similar personality. At least in their writing. They seem like people that likely don’t know how to be alone like when there is a real pandemic; and, if they do, they likely have to go online and seek validation constantly, like on Reddit.</p>
<p>The pandemic denial and the “everything’s fine” rose colored glasses allows them to disassociate yet still connect with one another. They seem to enjoy downplaying suffering they haven't personally experienced yet and chaos like POTUS getting hospitalized. These are people that seem disappointed when something negative happens or when negative news is reported that doesn't fit with their make-believe "everything's fine" bubble.</p>
<p>The bottom line, we seem to be dealing with people that believe they have "big, important things to do do" when they wake up most days. Hating on the daily pandemic developments gives them something to look forward to every day. They need a connection with others, like most of us, and the Rona gives them that. I think they are scared to death of reality finally bursting their bubble, because they fear losing the one thing that has allowed them to connect with others, the thing that has allowed them to feel like they are finally part of... a movement.  </p>
<p>That, or they are all just a bunch of crazy wackos. </p>
<p>And, scene.</p>

        <p>I get that your just trying to turn this around, but it doesn’t work here.</p>
<p>&rt; They seem like people that likely don’t know how to be alone like when there is a real pandemic; </p>
<p>People generally aren’t meant to be alone for months on end like this. We are social creatures. And whether you consider this a “real pandemic” has nothing to do with the question of whether we can stay home because healthy people staying home has never been recommended to deal with even the worst of pandemics in the past.</p>
<p>&rt; These are people that seem disappointed when something negative happens or when negative news is reported</p>
<p>You think being upset at positive things and negative things is anywhere near the same things? Being upset at negative news is normal. Being upset at positive news makes you somewhat of a psychopath.</p>
<p>&rt; The bottom line, we seem to be dealing with people that believe they have "big, important things to do do" when they wake up most days. Hating on the daily pandemic developments gives them something to look forward to every day. They need a connection with others, like most of us, and the Rona gives them that. I think they are scared to death of reality finally bursting their bubble, because they fear losing the one thing that has allowed them to connect with others, the thing that has allowed them to feel like they are finally part of... a movement.</p>
<p>This is where the comparison really starts to unravel. If we are finding validation for the first time because of the Rona why are we advocating to go back to normal? This argument only works one way and makes no sense when you try to flip it around like this.</p>

        <p>And then there are those of us who do have jobs, families, and social lives, and have pretty much carried on -- <em>while</em> taking precautionary measures as recommended by <em>most</em> reputable epidemiologists.  Secure in the knowledge that this <em>isn't</em> the new normal (that most people in this sub actually believe, thus making them doomers too). (12-18 months, as reputable epidemiologists suggested in March.  Not the "two more weeks<em> your idiot president pushed.) </em>Most* of the people I know in real life feel this way, and believe the anti maskers, anti vaxxers, etc -- can be lumped in with those on the other end of the spectrum.  A very small minority are in the "this is the new normal, deal with it, we're all going to die if you don't wear masks."</p>
<p>Tldr; you're hypocrites if you think your view is any less "doomer" than the tiny, but vocal, minority screaming at you to wear a mask for the rest of your life.</p>

        <p>Do you have a source for the 12-18 months suggestion by "reputable epidemiologists"? I don't remember agreeing to any of this. </p>
<p>My first reaction to "flatten the curve" was "it would only make it longer!". I wasn't happy, but I followed the recommendations so that the health care system was not saturated. This was in March through May. Now the healthcare system is fine, and I do not want your 12-18 months of bullshit.</p>
<p>The overreaction to covid should have been 
gradually wound down months ago. It is still going strong. This is the new normal, here and now. Until any measures remain, you have no leg to stand on when calling us "doomers".</p>

        <p>Thanks, but this is exactly the type of panicked bs that I objected to in March. Anyone with half a brain could see then that the economic destruction would be too vast to be justified unless the mortality turned out to be much higher. </p>
<p>Well, we figured out soon enough the mortality was not high enough to affect normal life even if left unchecked. Three months later we knew even that lockdowns were unnecessary in order to slow down infection. At that point no normal person should have expected another 9—15 months of this germophobia circus.</p>

        <p>Lmao, you’re wrong, and stop assuming everyone here is American. 2 weeks was what we all thought. Universities by we were not going to be closed longer than April at first.

        <p>12 to 18 months, and see the links I posted in response to someone else.  And I never said you agreed to it... What in my statement made you assume I or anyone else said you "agreed" to it?  That's ridiculous. Simply stating that the experts cautioned us way back in March.</p>

        <p>I think most can't do basic math and are more terrified of being labeled a "conspiracy theorist", probably also terrified by the fact that they're too dumb to assess basic risks and must rely on the "experts" to tell them what bandwagon we're hopping on this week. They know they might be wrong, but don't want to admit that they're to stupid to decide for themselves what's best for their family, so they do anything to justify the position they chose, as long as it's still the most popular position.</p>

        <p>Absolutely. Based on people I personally know to be doomers, on facebook and real life, part of the motivation seems to be not wanting to be seen as a crazy republican conspiracy theorist anti-masker who’s selfish and doesn’t care about people.

        <p>It's the marketing. If you have anything to say besides "stay safe stay home, wear a mask!", Then you must be Republican ,completely anti Vax antimask, and you must want old people to die! It was all the propoganda spread through 'karen' memes and anti Vax memes. Also all of the news attention given to trump supported and how they are linked closely to the anti mask movement etc. It's scary how brainwashed people are to make such assumptions if you so much as question any directive with regards to the virus.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I can believe that.  The sad and ironic part is that by their virtue signaling, they are really showing how little they actually care.  Parts of society are crumbling, and they are delusional to think that they aren't accelerating that plunge.  That makes them worse than those that are scared.</p>

        <p>Right? There are kids going to preschool and the teacher can't even assist them with going to the washroom etc. Kids are being robbed of a normal childhood during relevant developmental stages. My own niece 3 yrs old is being taught how to wipe her own butt because no one can help her at school due to covid. She's too young for that and struggles. Not to mention how many people have lost their jobs, small business closures.
The thing I cannot stand the most is the absolute self -righteousness, the selfish elevating of oneself for being so good and caring . Like let me post on social media how amazing I am I'm wearing a mask and protesting that kids should be forced to stay home out of school.</p>

        <p>that is a huge factor.  The number of people that i see walking their dogs, jogging, during BUSINESS HOURS has gone through the roof. They walk around with their earbuds to pretend they are working or on a call with their employer.  I having a very hard time getting hold of people.  Productivity has gone WAY down.</p>

        <p>My husband owns a business and had problems getting some of his employees back. They were getting payed to sit at home by the government even though the business was up and running and busy.  We have a bunch of teachers wining about going back to school and how it's not 'safe enough'. Well wear a mask and eye protection like everyone else and suck itbup, or quit. All children shouldn't be told to stay home because you feel unsafe  i'm a healthcare professional and all of the healthcare workers have been working with non-issue. Even my gym is charging fill price but now there's  limits , no lockers, showers ,change rooms and water fountains. Taking advantage of the situation.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately I think this has been a major cause of the polarization about this on social media. It’s far too common when I express anti-lockdown sentiments on this site for people to respond with something about how trump is an idiot even though I didn’t mention him in my comments and didn’t even vote for him. And while I think trump has said a lot of dumb things, the way the media works now they were gonna go full anti-trump no matter what he did. The annoying problem is now people are cemented in their pro-lockdown positions because they’ve tied that position to their TDS.</p>

        <p>I think I mentioned this here just the other day, but- do you remember the Charlie Hebdo shooting?  And the massive outpouring of "Je Suis Charlie" people were putting on everything?  I was off of social media then, but even I saw it everywhere.  It was heartening- a real moment of "we stand together against violence- and, more importantly, fear".  That's what I thought, anyway.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now I suspect most people just saw it as a chance to show off how anti-terrorist they were.  That's not a bad thing to show off, and it's definitely not a bad thing to be, but if you don't have guts backing it up, it just rings hollow.</p>

        <p>Its pretty narcissistic.  I think honestly a lot of them don't actually bother to understand where the other side is coming from.  Like no matter what you personally lose, it's not as important as what they want you to do.  I try to explain the situation with small businesses.  Like that most of them can't sustain months of reduced income.  Every day a restaurant is closed its costing money in refrigeration and electricity and rent.  The food eventually rots, and therefore you're having to resupply that.  Most have no idea, and they don't actually care.  </p>
<p>I think a lot of it is because they're either still children (of well-off parents) or tech-bros who have nothing to worry about.  If you don't have to worry about paying the rent and you don't personally know anyone who has to worry about rent, it's not on your radar.  To someone like that, especially if they're narcissists, the suffering doesn't exist for them.  Those people going to the food banks don't exist.  The family worried about being evicted doesn't exist.</p>

        <p>Oh yes, there is definitely a lack of empathy taking place in these discussions. Most doomers talk about the economy as some abstract, theoretical thing that doesn't permeate most of our lives. They scream, "you care about the economy more than our survival!" and it's like dude...how the fuck are people going to eat and pay rent without an economy? We care about the survival of all rather than just 87 year old grandma in a LTC who we should be taking extra precautions around anyway.</p>

        <p>So I just stumbled on this thread. I mean much love to all of you guys for being passionate about pissed off, fearful loaner Doomers. But you guys are just talking about “them” and these “other people”. I don’t even really get... sounds like a typical group of ppl that talk like they are better than everybody. Or like somebody who claims to have it all figured out and anybody else is wrong and since they are wrong they must be living completely shattered life.... and they might end it with something like “but I hope they figure themselves out...” or “something will wake them up eventually.” </p>
<p>I dunno I’m not joining either cult and I can’t even believe i wasted my time reading and/or commenting right now...</p>

        <p>Bunch of freaks. I mean, Doing something to protect others despite thinking that they, themselves, aren't in danger?</p>
<p>How disturbing. They should only care about themselves and not to anything that benefits anyone else, like reasonable people</p>

        <p>Yup, I'm shocked they aren't willing to just sacrifice the lives of others. What's the point of living when I have to wear this mask that makes literally zero difference and wash my hands..This is no kinda life!</p>
<p>Jesus wept, like I can understand being mad at the mishandling of the situation by the government. But criticizing the people that are actively attempting to just protect themselves and the vulnerable people in their lives, why?</p>

        <p>The other day I was slightly uncomfortable. It was awful. So awful, in fact, I suspect there is a world-wide conspiracy behind it. There's no way life is ever not the way I want it to be.</p>
