    <strong>Why the States are re-opening</strong>
    <p><p>The reason why some of the States are re-opening is because they need to justify closing them again, create more rules and restrictions and for a longer time.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because it's only a matter of time before 'the numbers are going up again' (and worse, more deaths) because of... 'the side-effects' of the v a x x i n e.</p>
<p>They won't admit this for obvious reasons, and probably tell it's a new deadlier variant or new type of C o v i d. (C-21)</p>
<p>Just a heads up. They won't let this crisis go to waste before everyone received 'the passport'.</p></p>

        <p>While at this point nothing would surprise me, I do think most states are opening now because they actually know they screwed up. They will never admit they made a mistake, but any rational person knows that lockdowns are not sustainable and this disease is not as deadly as we were led to believe a year ago.</p>

        <p>This is 100% correct and I been saying this for long now. Their plan is to allow a little normal back so people remember how it was, then BOOM hit us again and restrictions will be much worse.</p>
