        <p>That mod bans anyone who questions the Covidian dogma.  They are constantly removing posts and banning people who ask intelligent questions and provide good evidence against the Covid response.  I'm surprised they have enough time to pursue their degree.</p>

        <p>Yeah as others have pointed out the mod must have looked at my post history perhaps.  Or maybe they just simply ban anyone who asks these types of questions.  It's definitely disturbing either way.</p>

        <p>There definitely is some evidence, but it's all essentially theoretical or short term studies that look at limited dates of time as to whether or not covid cases dropped with mask usage.  What truly matters are the long term final results of whether or not areas with mask mandates have had fewer deaths per capita than areas without mask mandates.  It's one thing for masks to work in a lab study.  But do they actually work in the real world when mandated?  The answer seems to be possibly no.</p>

        <p>That's also what i think. Why would they censor something unless they are scared ? Why are some of the highly respected medical experts being censored and threatened for sharing their views ? Aren't they experts anymore ? </p>
<p>Mainstream medias do the same when they hide huge protests or anything that could give a hint to people that "hey,maybe something's fishy,can we speak about it ?". That's only to make us believe that we all think the same,we are all in this together and there's only one acceptable narrative and if you go astray you'll feel our wrath ! </p>
<p>It sadly works very well. Like i am impress at this level of brainwashing on such a large scale.</p>

        <p>Yeah I certainly don't believe in masks, but I tried to word it super politely and positively so that I'd get some good answers.  I genuinely was hoping they'd point out what they considered to be the best evidence.</p>

        <p>The moderator wasn't wrong, though. Your post said this:</p>
<p>&rt;What is the absolute best evidence that masks work? I believe in masks and I want to be armed with the best knowledge possible about why they work.</p>
<p>But your comment history says this:</p>
<p>&rt;I'm 36 and I haven't worn a mask once and I won't ever get the vaccine.</p>
<p>Doesn't take a genius to figure out that you were asking in bad faith. You 100% deserved your ban. It wouldn't surprise me if getting banned was your goal all along so that you can come here and cry censorship.</p>

        <p>The real question is why would a moderator feel compelled to take the time going around looking at comment history of perfectly legitimate posts?  You think that it is 100% legitimate to ban people for asking good sound questions?  Getting banned was of course not the goal.  Asking questions from all sides and learning the truth is the goal.</p>

        <p>To answer that. Technically you dont. But its an extra layer of protection. Nobody LIKES getting sick im sure so why not get poked? The needle is thin af so no worries there. I was scared first but there was enough explained when i went to get poked that i went through with it. There is no collective mind, they dont steal your organs. I even got two free hand sanitizers. I like free stuff...mmm free stuff.</p>

If you dont agree with what i say you let me know. If i dont agree with what you say ill let you know. No facts we cant prove ourselves.

<p>Umm "get the vaccine so we get our freedom back" is veeery similar to coercion. Specially when the restrictive measures have had no tangible effects on transmission compared to places without those same restrictions. I guess empirism is not valid anymore. </p>
<p>Getting banned from international travel, while being immune, unless I get a shot is basically blackmail.    </p>
<p>&rt;There isnt a liability for many things. Get used to it.</p>
<p>Very reasonable argument, absolutely detached from reality too. Every single other vaccine, medicine, medical treatment or procedure has liability. Every single product in the market has some form of liability. From cars, to foods, to financial products to services.</p>
<p>You come across as a weird mix of naive, ignorant and condescendent.</p>

Theres your info regarding why they arent liable here.</p>
<p>The reason measures haven't worked is cuz those measures arent taken seriously. "I didnt get sick" isnt a good enough excuse anymore. You indirectly may have gotten someone else sick and while they may have not died isnt that just super selfish? You went to a party, got someone sick and then act like what you did was ok cuz YOU didnt get sick.</p>

        <p>I know why they aren't liable. The argument is poor. It could be justified <strong>with proper informed consent</strong> in the elderly. Having an experimental vaccine on the youth and/or already immune without liability is incredibly reckless and concerning. The risk/benefit balance is gone.       </p>
<p>&rt;The reason measures haven't worked is cuz those measures arent taken seriously</p>
<p>The reason they haven't worked is because they aren't scientific. That's why the very own WHO <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/329438/9789241516839-eng.pdf">didn't recommend</a> most of those measures under any circumstance. Not even in severe pandemics (this is a "moderate" one by their own standards). Look at the PDF, from p.20.   </p>
<p>My entire country spent 2 months strictly arrested at home and you literally must wear masks if you want to buy any food. This argument is pure denial of reality: measures don't work. Look at Florida, look at Sweden. Look at Texas after they opened like Neanderthals and had cases plunge anyway.      </p>
<p>And do you know why they don't work? Cause there's still no evidence of asymptomatic transmission. I dare you to find a proper study on it. I've tried. Most I've found is predictive models (aka not reality), studies that insidiously put asymptomatic and presymptomatic in the same bucket, and prevalence studies that for some reason decide that the existence of asymptomatic individuals equals asymptomatic transmission. Go try for yourself.    </p>
<p>&rt;Our estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic cases and their risk of transmission suggest that asymptomatic spread is unlikely to be a major driver of clusters or community transmission of infection, but the extent of transmission risk for pre-symptomatic and minor symptomatic cases remains unknown. The generalisability of the overall estimate is unclear, and we observed considerable variation across the included studies, which had different settings, countries, and study design, reflected in the reasonably wide prediction interval.</p>
<p>https://jammi.utpjournals.press/doi/10.3138/jammi-2020-0030</p>
<p>&rt;It’s also unclear to what extent people with no symptoms transmit SARS-CoV-2. The only test for live virus is viral culture. PCR and lateral flow tests do not distinguish live virus. No test of infection or infectiousness is currently available for routine use.678 As things stand, a person who tests positive with any kind of test may or may not have an active infection with live virus, and may or may not be infectious.9</p>
<p>https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4851</p>
<p>&rt;All close contacts of the asymptomatic positive cases tested negative, indicating that the asymptomatic positive cases detected in this study were unlikely to be infectious.</p>
<p>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19802-w</p>
<p>And do you know why masks don't work? For two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Because of the above. 99% of the wearers can't transmit anything.     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because the virus is aerosolized. It's literally in the air. Masks main foundation (without evidence in transmission) was the droplet theory. If the thing is in the air, it doesn't matter if you wear a mask. You still breath air. Only ventilation/ fresh air can solve that.    </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That's why, when restrictions stop, things are literally the same.</p>
<p>&rt;"I didnt get sick" isnt a good enough excuse anymore. You indirectly may have gotten someone else sick and while they may have not died isnt that just super selfish? You went to a party, got someone sick and then act like what you did was ok cuz YOU didnt get sick.</p>
<p>Wtf even is this rant and how does it have any relation with me?</p>

        <p>I'm sure that, despite your swift response, you read my sources (science!), understood the reasonings behind them and contemplated that they might make sense. Surely you were impressed by how all national governments ignored these previous WHO recommendations from minute 1, and still do.    </p>
<p>Very elaborate and insightful response btw. Full of data and solid arguments. Not the slightest scent of dogma can be found in your comments. Only science™.</p>

        <p>Dude you have it in front of your eyes and refuse to see it lol. Yeah, of course governments have failed. And it's a HUGE DEAL. They've upended billions of lives, fucked up the future of the youth, removed <strong>human rights</strong> because they're acting on POLITICS, NOT SCIENCE.      </p>
<p>And they've used and are using all the propagandistic firepower they have to convince you they're doing the right thing. And fleeing forward making up pseudoscientific arguments on the go.    </p>
<p>Let's get back to this thing you said:</p>
<p>&rt;The reason measures haven't worked is cuz those measures arent taken seriously. </p>
<p>You've seen that the WHO didn't recommend quarantines on the healthy PERIOD. Governments mandated it and mandate it still. That's anti-science and violating a <strong>HUMAN RIGHT.</strong>    </p>
<p>You've seen that the WHO recommended school and workplace closures only <strong>as a last resource</strong> in <strong>extremely severe pandemics.</strong> Governments did it on day one, and many still do. Even against evidence. Btw those two are HUMAN RIGHTS. </p>
<p>You've seen that the WHO opposed contact tracing period. Governments have wasted billions on it anyway. Violating PRIVACY CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.     </p>
<p>You've seen that the WHO only recommended border restrictions on <strong>early phases</strong> of pandemics. Border controls are still in place.     </p>
<p>The measures didn't work cause THEY'VE NEVER BEEN BASED ON SCIENCE.</p>

        <p>This is about the fact that human rights are absolute and inalienable. And they're always important, but specially in times of crisis.      </p>
<p>Governments all over the planet panicked in domino fashion over a disease with outlandish wrong early data from China, and never admitted the mistake.      </p>
<p>Instead, they've tried to twist reality into absurdity in order to save face. All of this violating human rights left and right for no tangible gains, ruining economies and psyches for decades to come, and setting a terrifying legal/political precedent that could (and probably will) give birth to one or more dictatorship(s).            </p>
<p>This entire shitshow is because appeareances matter more than anything. Saving face is the supreme goal. China lied to save face. Governments are trapped in this absurdity to save face. People virtue signal in social media cause appeareances matter the most, while refusing to acknowledge that many elderly died cause society as a whole wasted resources on propaganda and useless performative restrictions that could've saved thousands of vulnerable people if used properly.     </p>

        <p>1) you can believe in something and not do it yourself. For example, someone could believe in masks but not be able to wear one due to a medical condition</p>
<p>2) people can change their minds about things</p>
<p>3) post history shouldn't determine whether someone is banned or not. Behavior and actual content of comments should.</p>

<p>The context matters here, and the context is that OP was obviously lying about his intentions when asking the question, which you can easily infer from his post history. OP was behaving like a troll.</p>

        <p>Fun fact. He states "i believe in masks" and then says something im sure has been asked multiple times on the subreddit. If yall want in fact. Ill make a post like the one he put on there. Stating something that is obviously a lie is...a good reason to be called a troll.</p>

        <p>I don't agree with your views on Covid and I don't think the O.P. deserved a ban considering lying is not against the rules, but you do have a point. Lying is wrong and the O.P. should have gotten called out for lying. It's a shame my fellow skeptics downvoted you.</p>

        <p>Thanks, I appreciate the sentiment!</p>
<p>I don't really have strong views on Covid, though? If OP doesn't want to wear a mask, that's his business. It's the dishonesty that bothers me. And the fact that he got caught trying to concern troll, got banned for it, and is now acting like he's a martyr for free speech. That frustrates me because we live in a world with actual censorship. The last thing we need is more people crying wolf.</p>
