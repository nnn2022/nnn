    <strong>OT: Reddit's algorithm manipulating votes?</strong>
    <p><p>So there's around 4.3k people online right now on this sub.</p>
<p>However, only 3 threads have broken 1k upvotes. </p>
<p>Most of the threads in the "Hot" section are around 300 upvotes or less.</p>
<p>If you go to one of the threads in the Hot section and continuously refresh, you can see the amount of votes go up and down, never being able to surpass a certain number.</p>
<p>A few days ago, someone posted a video demonstrating this effect. I think it was posted here, but it could've also been in /r/DeclineIntoCensorship.</p>
<p>Going back to the 4.3k people online, this is just right now. More people will eventually get some free time to visit the sub, browse the content, and upvote popular threads. So the total people who visit this sub per day is far more than 4.3k. Granted, not everyone here is friendly to our cause, but we have nearly 100k subscribers, so you'd have to imagine that the vast majority of them are friendly and certainly enough to get most threads in the Hot section passed 1k at the very least but, IMO, it should be around 3k upvotes.</p>
<p>Anyone, just wondering if this is Reddit's algorithm manipulating the upvotes because it seems pretty fishy.</p></p>

        <p>True. I was around when T_D had less than 100k members and I know a lot of Reddit's tricks, but maybe I didn't understand how they were doing it. </p>
<p>Like, what I see now, it leaves no trace because you can see that threads are 95% upvoted or something, but IIRC, T_D threads were never that high.</p>
<p>Anyway, just wanted to get people's opinions on this to see if there's consensus that Reddit is censoring this sub.</p>
<p>I believe it is, but it's never a bad idea to ask around and see if I'm just missing something.</p>

        <p>Random question but what was the “official” reason that T_D got banned?</p>
<p>I was never active on that sub but I used to go it sometimes and I don’t remember anything that bad or “ban worthy”. Mostly just news articles and lots of Pepe memes. I was kind of confused when it got banned</p>

        <p>They supposedly made a threat against police, but that was BS and virtually every leftist subreddit should be banned if the admins were being honest.</p>

        <p>Most Trump supporters seem to be more of the “blue lives matter” persuasion, so I find that pretty hard to believe. Or it was just one random user that said it…</p>
<p>It also might have been fake. For a while trolls were posting a bunch of racist stuff on here to try to paint us as a “hate sub” until the mods cracked down on it. I could see the same thing happening.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for answering! :)</p>

        <p>NP man.</p>
<p>And yeah, as ridiculous as it sounds, that was the reason given. </p>
<p>I don't have an official news source to cite, but here's some twitter comments saying the same thing:</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/search?q=the_donald%20reddit%20cops&amp;src=typed_query</p>
<p>I guess Reddit was waiting for the most ironic reason they can think of to ban T_D.</p>
<p>With that said, T_D was a former shell of itself after /u/CisWhiteMaelstrom was forced out. The mods began caving to every demand from the admins and free speech was all but dead.</p>

        <p>I can confirm OP words. It was banned becaise of a supposely threat to police. Which we can read almost everyday on other aubreddits... <br>
Anyway most of reddit was happy about this obvious censorship, 'cause you know, orange man bad.   </p>
<p>But, at this time you could see the manipulation. You could witness yourself that reddit admins were hidding real numbers. One day they messedup and we saw the real numbers. It was like 5 times more than what they were showing. Admins also edited comments.  <br>
I mean, you have to "live" it to understand how reddit a censored website, a propaganda website.</p>

<p>&rt; I don't disagree, but I think it's the algorithm due to how they're able to cancel out upvotes in real-time.

        <p>Its part reddit fucking with the votes (can't let real information get to the ALL page) and some of it is actually paid actors downvoting good information.</p>
<p>I've noticed that most of what gets up to 1k or even 2k on this sub is usually inane bullshit.  But, once in a while a good post will get up there and then it will be downvoted to hell in about an hour.</p>
