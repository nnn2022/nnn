        <p>I agree completely about looking at deaths based on the date of death instead of the date of report. Same for testing. Either by test date or symptom onset are fine, 'date reported' is garbage.</p>
<p>The problem is that there will always be a lag in reporting. I don't expect to get death data compiled within 48 hours. That's completely unreasonable. But what that does mean is the that we can't really say much about the last week or so. Even if it looks like the deaths are going down over the last 2 weeks it could just be reporting delays.</p>
