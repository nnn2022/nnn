    <strong>Just a lurker here but... Does anyone want to weigh in on this hypothesis?</strong>
    <p><p>I've been following this subreddit for a few weeks now, and my mind has been blown in so many ways. So much of what you guys have said makes sense. I've been thinking about the covid cases, hospitalizations, and deaths suddenly going up (even though it's almost summer and vaccinations are going up), and I have a few thoughts possibly as to the reason why. Maybe I'm way off base, but I just wanted to post and see what you guys think. Please be kind as I'm new.</p>
<p>1) Because the PCR tests are known to be extremely likely to cause false positives (see other sources on this subreddit), wouldn't it make sense that people being hospitalized or dying from the vaccine would somehow be classified as covid hospitalizations/deaths? If they tested them "positive" with the PCR test but they were there due to the vaccine, I'm sure that this could cause the hospitalizations and deaths to start rising exponentially. I could see how they would do this to instigate more lockdowns, and keep fear and control going.</p>
<p>Or,</p>
<p>2) New variants are spreading in the summer more than the original virus, people are feeling fatigued from all the restrictions and letting down their guard, and the hospitalizations and deaths going up are actually from the "4th wave" of covid, having nothing to do with the vaccine. This seems like what the mainstream news will say is causing the rise.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p></p>

        <p>To me the whole mess is defined by its track record of deceit... because they began with lies and exaggerations, everything else coming out subsequently should have been suspect.</p>
<p>Any hypothesis outside the established narrative has merit- even if it's ultimately disproven, it's the product of free thinking- keep that up.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm gonna make this as simple as possible:</p>
<p>Verifiably, as per independent research, most claims of ‚Äòcovid‚Äô have been influenza A and B. </p>
<p>The CDC have been asked for an isolated covid-19 viral particle, to which they responded they ‚Äòhad none‚Äô. There are lawsuits against them for that, in the name of ‚Äòcovid fraud‚Äô.</p>
<p>Simply put, Covid-19 doesn‚Äôt exist. As in, covid-19 is not a scary new virus, but is an alias for the flu. The reason for that is because it can become an ever changing landscape, because, you know, it‚Äôs ‚Äònovel‚Äô. </p>
<p>The PCR test takes this a step further because all it does is tests for ‚Äògenetic material‚Äô. Hint: we all have genetic material. A cycle increase on a PCR ‚Äòmagnifies‚Äô or ‚Äòincreases sensitivity‚Äô by a factor of 1 trillion. A PCR test running on 50 cycles can detect genetic material in stone. The WHO recommended local health dictates to run the test at 40 cycles, which Fauci himself claimed anything above 30-35 will produce ‚Äòfalse positives‚Äô. </p>
<p>In other words, upwards of 90% of ‚Äòcovid-19‚Äô cases are false positives, and in no way suggest a clinical infection. </p>
<p>And, perhaps I should reiterate this important point: ‚Äòcovid-19‚Äô is the flu.</p>

<li>Yes</li>
<li>I thinks that is from the ‚Äúvax‚Äù and still poor PCR tests that inflate numbers. </li>
<li>if big pharma wants to continue it‚Äôs control an emergency needs to remain in play</li>
<li>vitamin D and Ivermectin/zinc is not spoken about in the media because if there is another cure for covid, pharma will not be able to continue it‚Äôs trial</li>

        <p>I like your number 2. The way I see it is well depending on where you are. For example I‚Äôm in California and our bs ass governor has recently started to ‚Äúallow‚Äù us more normality . Sports are open to public now to a certain degree along with theme parks and stuff. I feel it will be a temporary thing where we get to taste our freedoms back then they will drill in the idea thru the MSM that restrictions/lockdowns etc were eased to soon and that‚Äôs why cases are rising. Then this will justify reimplementing lock downs etc. This will continue to break people down psychologically and possibly make people feel the only option is to get the vax to get these lockdowns done with ALTHOUGH clearly these vaccines aren‚Äôt doing anything considering fully vaccinated people are still told to mask up, keep distanced and all of that same ol bs. Also I feel maybe they are realizing that a lot of people are also not buying this whole covid scheme at this point so ‚Äúbring on the variants !‚Äù so they can maintain everyone manipulated into now fearing the variants because the original isn‚Äôt enough or something along those lines. Not sure if that makes sense ü§î</p>

        <p>Unfortunately the way they classify Covid cases and deaths it's pretty much impossible to know without a massive investigation into the death certificates. I've seen in England they are now trying to push 2x weekly testing and that would certainly drive up the numbers, I'm not sure how much that is being pushed in the US though.</p>
