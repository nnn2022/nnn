    <strong>International student in OSU asking for some insight and explore options.</strong>
    <p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> OSU made itself clear months ago that it would consider making vaccines mandatory, so I did get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Oregon State University is making vaccinations mandatory for in-person learning. This policy will take place as soon as the Fall term begins in September, 2021. My opening comment states that I did in fact get vaccinated because, given the circumstances of lockdown in Oregon, it at the very least gave me the option of taking the mask off. In no way would I lie about my health status to take advantage of a situation.</p>
<p>With that being said, I have come to a crossroads with Fall term coming up. Although I did get vaccinated, I do not want to participate in a "vaccine passport" effort that would incentivize the Orwellian agenda pursued by the overlords at the top of our hierarchies. As a result, these are some options that I have, according to OSU:</p>
<p>1) Register my vaccine record and become another sheep in the herd.</p>
<p>2) Claim a medical or non-medical exemption.</p>
<p>Claiming for a medical exemption is a no-go because it does not apply to me and, once again, I will not lie. Non-medical exemptions are a little trickier, but the waiver states the following:</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/46sot9awklg71.png?width=633&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89e06c4af0addf31edef01bc2f2c1cc6e23a32f2">Student Attestations waiver sent by OSU</a></p>
<p>As noted above, the last point clearly says:</p>
<p>&rt;I verify that I am declining receiving a COVID-19 vaccination</p>
<p>This is the point where I do not know what to do. I did get vaccinated, so I would be lying in saying that I denied receiving a vaccine. However, I will not bend my knee to the overlords imposing vaccine passports. What else can I do? What <em>should</em> I do?</p></p>
