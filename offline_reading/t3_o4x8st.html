        <p>It gets better. They just broadened the definition of "anti-vaxxer" to include those that are against "<em>laws that mandate vaccination</em>"</p>
<p>https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anti-vaxxer</p>
<p>So, the pressure applied to "anti-vaxxer" will also apply to those that are against mandating them, when they do finally mandate them.</p>

        <p>&rt; the decisions in the same family as forced sterilization and other eugenics programs which have been effectively overturned through continued narrowing and cordoning off in more recent decisions</p>
<p>The reasons that apply to those don't apply to forced vaccination. A great quote from that SCOTUS case is this:</p>
<p>&rt;Real liberty for all could not exist under the operation of a principle which recognizes the right of each individual person to use his own [liberty], whether in respect of his person or his property, regardless of the injury that may be done to others.</p>
<p>"Your right to swing your fists ends just where my nose begins" if you will. The assertion that this type of reasoning will be overturned and removed from the case law is preposterous. This kind of reasoning is as baked into the foundations of our constitution as anything else. </p>
<p>&rt;and in-so-far as these specific injections, the "balance" between individual and public benefit if actually argued with real evidence in court is going to lean towards "not good enough," like it already has at least in some courts across the world</p>
<p>I think you might be right here, but I don't think you are interpreting the court cases correctly. So far as I know, no countries or states have even attempted to issue mandatory vaccination orders for the population. If they were to do so for COVID, I agree that the vaccination order would probably get struck down. However, the general ability of the states to issue mandatory vaccination orders in the face of a pandemic is not going to be overturned anytime soon.</p>

<p>but that is all Jacobson and forced vaccination generally is. As long as "Your right to swing your fists ends just where my nose begins." is a legal philosophy held to by SCOTUS, then forced vaccinations will remain constitutional.</p>

        <p>If a person against "vaccine" mandates is an anti-vaxxer, then I sure as shit am one.</p>
<p>This is a power game using words. They know you're not an "anti-vaxxer," but they don't care; that's not the point of calling you it. They do it because they're trying to get power over you and it worked. Now you're going to want to bicker about whether the label is fair. You're playing defense and discussing this one <em>their</em> terms.</p>
<p>And in-so-far as a reasonable definition of "anti-vaxxer" is concerned, I sure as shit will never give any vaccine the benefit of the doubt ever again. The FDA, CDC, and various medical institutions have been ridiculously exposed through this whole thing as incompetent shitbags at best and disgusting people deserving the utmost contempt more likely.</p>

<p>The “covid vaccine” is by definition not a vaccine.  It is mRNA gene therapy.</p>

        <p>This will ingratiate you to nobody. For anyone who isn't already skeptical, you are the identicle to someone who's against all vaccines. </p>
<p>I don't think there's any reason at this point to be throwing OG antivaxers under the bus. Right or wrong, they've been dealing with the same bullshit we are now a lot longer. We could use anyone we can get pushing in the right direction, we can argue about where to stop when we get there.</p>
