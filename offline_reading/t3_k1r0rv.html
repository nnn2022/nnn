    <strong>Since the media has put a emphasis on deaths of young people in a effort to scare the public, I’ll share one of my own. My 80+ year old grandmother has recovered from COVID-19 without even going to the ER.</strong>
    <p><p>I was slightly worried initially because she does have some ongoing medical issues and isn’t exactly running marathons, but the only reason she found out she had COVID-19 was due to a hospital not admitting her for another procedure without a test due to her cough. Definitely happy about it. </p>
<p>I realize there’s going to be some trolls on this sub who either will count this as anecdotal or doubt it’s accuracy, well welcome to being in our shoes, that’s been our point all along with our 99.997% and 99.98% IFR statistics for 0-19, and 20-49 that aren’t advertised to the general public, and you guys seemingly finding young people who died from this under every rock. I’d say that’s far more unbelievable than my grandmother being part of the 94.6% in here bracket that didn’t die. I’m not sure what percent get hospitalized but still, can’t imagine it’s high enough to make my eyes pop out of my sockets. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html#:~:text=COVID%2D19%20Pandemic%20Planning,%2C%20or%20other%20interventions. Source for all IFR data used here. </p>
<p>Anyway, just figured I’d share it, because it happened and I’m thankful for it, on thanksgiving.</p></p>

        <p>No, it is not the 'common goddamned cold'. If it was, my 69 year old mother and 69 year old transplant patient father, both of whom had good immune systems and in the case of my mother better than me, would have laughed at it and recovered instead of dying from this virus!</p>
<p>It is a real issue in the real world for people over 60 and/or with pages of pre-existing conditions.</p>
<p>Stop downplaying it.</p>
<p>A 5% fatality rate in those groups is nothing to downplay!</p>
<p>Now we can argue that the mask bullshit and the lockdown bullshit is not the proper course to take but stop downplaying this very serious virus.</p>

        <p>Sorry to hear of your loss but i also lost a 22 year old step daughter becasue of the measures.</p>
<p>Now people who have transplants take immune suppression drugs to prevent organ rejection and are typically on them for life.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/organ-transplants-without-life-long-drugs">https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/organ-transplants-without-life-long-drugs</a></p>
<p>Therefore your father's immune system was severely compromised. Additionally these drugs are also prescribed for numerous other conditions:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/immunosuppressant-drugs">https://www.healthline.com/health/immunosuppressant-drugs</a></p>
<p>So I cannot speak for your mother but if she had any of these conditions she may have also had a very compromised immune system.</p>
<p>Finally, people die from many causes that are far worse than COVID..It's the unfortunate cycle of life. A simple seasonal flu could have had the same outcome with your parents, especially if it developed into a pneumonia. </p>
<p>My father who is in his 70's and who is quite healthy, except for his vulnerability to respiratory infections, therefore he has to be extremely careful becasue any flu  / cold virus that could makes its way to his lungs could kill him..Not just COVID. So a cold virus with respect to my father can be defined as very serious. </p>
<p>I don't mean to sound insensitive, but the numbers are clear, this is not a lethal virus, just like if my father died from catching  cold, I can't claim how serious that virus is, the numbers just do not support it. Like any virus or any other condition for that matter, they can be lethal to any given person depending on circumstances, and their has been and always will be people who are more vulnerable than others. We can't live in fear everyday becasue of what might happen.</p>
<p>Anyway again, i am sorry for your loss, but I also have to deal with the death of my step daughter who lost her life to the measures of COVID and when I analyze the data I can only shake my head that her life was lost becasue of numbers that reflect a bad flu season...I can't come to terms with that.</p>

        <p>I agree actually. For nearly everyone, it's a common godamned cold, except for those who are unlucky, and it becomes a systemic disease. </p>
<p>But for most, it is not serious. It is, at best, the uncommon cold. When I was younger I had some level of virus or another that kicked my ass. At 28, I caught an adenovirus which left me feeling like I was pissing fire, left my eyes in a mess, and contributed to the single most painful experience of my life making it feel like said eyeballs actually exploded. </p>
<p>Still, I am not going to demand everyone 'be safe' for me.</p>

        <p>From what I can see, the only way to get the 'rona is to get the test. The test CAUSES the disease. If you are unlucky enough to get caught in the medical machine, they'll slap you on a ventilator. In that case, you ain't getting out except in a box!  (info here &amp; on youtube) <a href="https://muchadoaboutcorona.ca/nyc-deaths/">https://muchadoaboutcorona.ca/nyc-deaths/</a>  The ones that do "drop like flies" are old fatarse diabetic smokers with more co-morbidities than you can shake a stick at. Your grandma is probably *very* healthy (for her age). And 99.8% totally recover, with most never knowing that they contracted a "massively deadly disease." The media IS the disease! Obviously your grandma does not pay any attention to the media, thus she is immune. The 'rona is a modern form of voodoo where "faithful believers" are conned into a hysterically (stress) induced death. Voodoo works folks! Just as the voodoo-mask wearers who *know* their face nappy will protect them against a 5 micro virus (which can easily go though those nappies). My guess is that victims of the 'rona are also massive hypochandriacs who die of thrombosis caused by excessive stress.</p>

        <p>Well said, and happy for your grandma. And expecially true what you said about the media putting emphasis on young people. Per cdc data, easily found from a google search, on their official website, my age range (15-24) has had only 428 deaths in the US to date. Statistically that age range is over 10x more likely to die in a car crash.</p>
<p>Im in a college town, have had Covid and know dozens of people who have had it. The other day someone posted some fear mongering comment about some young healthy person being in the hospital so I just shared my experience that it really wasn't bad for me, be careful, but don't kill yourself with stress about it. Someone gave some snarky comment, "I hope you know your lucky and should be grateful."  I mean, I'm all for counting my blessings but man if I was actually worried for myself about Covid I would have been walking out of the house in a hazmat bubble suit way before Covid came along. Having any serious reaction to Covid would statistically for me actually would be considered extremely unlucky.</p>
