    <strong>Does anyone else just feel that we're ahead of the curve?</strong>
    <p><p>I remember back in January 2020, I started tracking Covid and it's rise in China.</p>
<p>I remember telling my co-workers in February 2020 that things were gonna get worse and we were all going to be sent home to work. They laughed at me yet in March 2020, it happened.</p>
<p>I remember having to stitch my own mask in March 2020 because at the time, I was scared into thinking it was super deadly and you could not find masks anywhere. </p>
<p>I remember people looking at me oddly as I walked around shops with my handmade mask while they wore none because they had no idea what was going on.</p>
<p>Now I'm walking around without a mask because I kept up to date with things and I realised that it simply wasn't necessary and now people look at me oddly for that.</p>
<p>It's like the average Joe is a year behind us, trying to figure shit out and catch up.</p>
<p>I pity the fools. ðŸ˜‚</p></p>

<p>this is true of covid, but if youâ€™re paying attention, youâ€™ll realize this is true of life in general as well</p>
