    <strong>The Infestation of Conspiracy Theorists: Are You at Risk? By Ginny Stoner | nworeporter.com</strong>
    <p><p><strong>con·spir·a·cy the·o·rist (kən-spîr′ə-sē thē′ər-ĭst)</strong>  </p>
<p><em>n.</em> A person who questions any official story about anything.  </p>
<p>***  </p>
<p>Examples of CONSPIRACY THEORIST in a sentence:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When  Betty said she doubted the official story of 9/11, her family realized  she had become a conspiracy theorist and quickly staged an intervention.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When  Mr. and Mrs. Carter’s baby died suddenly soon after vaccination, they  became conspiracy theorists and refused to vaccinate their next baby,  until Child Protective Services intervened.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dr.  Jones suspected the pesticide being used to kill mosquitos was more  dangerous than the Zika virus it was said to prevent, so he was  diagnosed as a conspiracy theorist and quarantined to stop the spread of  dangerous ideas.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>\~\~\~  </p>
<p>Conspiracy theorists:  They’re like cockroaches, lurking in the cupboards of civilization,  ready to scurry out of every crack in consensus reality. We need to be  prepared with bug spray, to keep the infestation in check.  </p>
<p>Let’s face it--the last thing we want to hear when we’re standing in line for our <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2016/07/01/zika-hoax-strategy-of-liars-house-of-cards/">Zika</a>  vaccination is some yahoo telling us the vaccine is more dangerous than  the virus. Sure, smart people will know that the fact the vaccine is  licensed is proof positive it’s safe and effective and will save the  world. But the potential for nagging doubt is still there, and it’s a  real downer for everyone in line.      </p>
<p>Studies show that  conspiracy theorists are mentally ill, but entirely unaware of their  derangement. For reasons that are still a mystery, conspiracy theorists  don't realize there is one thing we can always be certain of in an  uncertain world: that official authorities would never lie to us.   </p>
<p>Sure,  officials in other countries might lie sometimes, especially in Russia,  and Third World nations where anything goes--but not our own.   </p>
<p>What's more, we can count on the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6">media</a>  to provide a tight layer of protection from any possible untruths  officials might try to slip by us. Highly trained teams of investigative  reporters for all the major news channels are constantly lying in wait,  ready to pounce on any inconsistency or flaw in the official story.  Doubting any official story that has been vetted by our media Guardians  of Truth is absurd to any sane and intelligent person.  </p>
<p>Experts  are still uncertain about the reasons for the mental derangement of  conspiracy theorists. Several hypotheses are are being tested: an  unknown contagious virus; a faulty gene, probably caused by their  mother's failure to take all her recommended vaccines and prescribed  medications during pregnancy; a deficiency of fluoride in the diet; or  perhaps even an extreme deprivation of television.  </p>
<p>If you have  the misfortune to encounter a conspiracy theorist, the best bug spray is  aggressive contempt and ridicule; or, for the more tender-hearted,  pity. Just remember that, like cockroaches, conspiracy theorists might  startle you, or even frighten you, but they can’t really hurt you. Not  unless you listen to them.  </p>
<p>Under no circumstances should you  attempt to reason with a conspiracy theorist. Experts warn they have a  pathological immunity to logic, and are completely unfazed when logical  arguments are presented, such as:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“That’s a crazy conspiracy theory,” or  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Your source is known conspiracy theorist,” or  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Your claims have been thoroughly debunked,” or  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“You’ve been duped by discredited sources.”  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These  solid logical arguments fly right over the heads of conspiracy  theorists, who often respond by imploring us to actually examine  evidence that official sources assure us has been thoroughly debunked  and discredited.  </p>
<p>As  rational people, there is nothing we dread more than being slapped with  the label of “conspiracy theorist.” But it’s actually very easy to  avoid this humiliating situation. Whether you’re discussing politics,  economics, education, banking, science, medicine, or social justice,  just keep your bug spray of contempt handy, and always stay within  Google distance of Snopes. There's no better source than Snopes for the  official story about everything.  </p>
<p>Stay  vigilant, because you never know when a conspiracy theorist might  scurry through a crack in our carefully manufactured reality.</p></p>

        <p>Conspiracies are probabilities.  Some conspiracies are so unlikely that if you believe them you're an idiot, other ones are good to consider to avoid risk.</p>
<p>For example the flat earth conspiracy goes against everything we know in science and would need to involve billions of people.  If you believe it you're dumb.  </p>
<p>Another conspiracy was that GW Bush knew Iraq didn't have WMD.  People were labeled conspiracy theorists that believed his administration and the pentagon were bolstering invalid evidence that Iraq had WMD.  This post claims that "investigative reporters" should have been all over that.  They were not, and the corporate media just parroted everything the Pentagon was saying.  Being skeptical of Bush's claims would not have been crazy.  Maybe if we didn't "trust the experts" and listened to other people in the UN and other countries around the world we could have prevented a war that killed millions and spent trillions of dollars.</p>
<p>It's all about risk mitigation.  Imagine if someone at the CIA said we received intel from a North Korean defector that their leader is planning to launch a missile on Hawaii.  Then imagine if the entire CIA said "that's a conspiracy theory, stop with your baseless claims."  Why would they do that?  Why not consider the possibility, get more information, if they determine that it's too unlikely and not worth considering then they don't have to worry about it.  </p>
<p>As an average citizen we have incomplete information.  We can look at the record of  Pharmaceutical companies and Government and then do our own risk analysis to determine if we trust something like a new vaccine using new technology.  If you don't trust it you're not crazy.  You just think the risk of getting sick from covid and having a bad outcome is less than all the other scenarios that might be bad from having the vaccine.  That's it.  You could think the conspiracy where they are intentionally putting something bad in the vaccine is 0.01% and still think that it's not worth the risk because of that.  Or it could be about how there isn't long-term safety data and that's why you don't think it's worth it.  Either case it's not crazy.  Labeling people conspiracy theorists is just a way to shame people.  There's nothing wrong with saying something is extremely unlikely but we should still consider the possibility.</p>
