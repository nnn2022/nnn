        <p>I went to the mall today to buy a LEGO set. They were only letting 3-5 people into each store at a time to ensure social distancing.</p>
<p>As you can imagine every other square foot of the mall was packed with bodies that it was reminiscent of riding the trains during rush hour in Japan.</p>
<p>Mass confusion on how each store’s line worked in such a huge crowd. People were getting into screaming fights over claims of line cutting.</p>
<p>It was like an amusement park with long lines everywhere. The couple behind me were trying to strategize on which stores they had time to wait in line for before the mall closed at 6pm.</p>
<p>I waited in line an hour to get into a LEGO store where I spent maybe 60 seconds buying what they had on hold for me and then walked straight out.</p>
<p>We are living in truly strange times.</p>

        <p>A lot of the measures are counterproductive like that. Where I live businesses except for supermarket and gas stations have to close their public toilet. So what's the result? More people per toilet of course. People still got to pee but now there are fewer toilets available.</p>
<p>I also heard they're going to reduce times that shops may be open. So what will then be the result? People still need to eat. We'll just have the same amount of people but with less time to be in the stores i.e. more people per unit of time and thus more people getting close to each other.</p>
<p>But it does not matter. It's not about the fictional COVID-19 pandemic. It's all about control and power over people. Treating people like mindless cattle and making them obey stupid rules probably helps to condition them to be more obedient by making them get used to it and making mindless obedience the norm for future generations to learn.</p>

        <p>People acting like mindless cattle. That's nothing new but they are taking it to new heights now. And those fools are supposed to fight for their freedom? Just get in line, wear your piece of fabric, and pretend that acting as if all your peers are lepers is good social behaviour. Why? Because obey your masters. That's why. Good cattle.</p>
<p>I also hate the term "social distancing". The term itself is propaganda. Acting like other people are too disgusting to get even near them is not social. Proximity and physical contact can be important to normal human social behaviour and bonding. Acting like your friends and family are lepers is the opposite of social, it's anti-social. So-called "social distancing" is really anti-social distancing. Making us call it by an incorrect name is propaganda in itself. Just call it "social distancing" 50 times per day and then you may just start to believe the nonsense of it being social.</p>
<p>That's why I call it "anti-social" distancing. It's distancing and anti-social. "Anti-social distancing" is more a description than it is a name, actually. Though I guess in the "new normal" (which I like to call "old abnormal"—again just describing it) I guess we would consider anti-social behaviour to be social.</p>
<p>This reminds me of 1984's slavery is freedom etc. Anti-social behaviour is now social.</p>
