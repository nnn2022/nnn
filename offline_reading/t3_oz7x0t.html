    <strong>Slightly or largely overreacting?</strong>
    <p><p>Officially diagnosed in childhood Hypochondriac here. Given my fear of all diseases and their treatments as well (both meds and the illnesses) I am both paranoid of Covid and the Vaccination. So point being, although unvaccinated, I have made sure to be extremely careful. Staying a shut-in, taking Vitamin D and Emergen-C every day, double masking, etc.</p>
<p>Well.. shut-in life went to an end when the job I applied for sent me to Maryland Aug 2nd - 4th for the next step in the security clearance process...</p>
<p>The 3rd, had psych eval, asked before it if I had any covid symptoms (they listed them off) I told her slight irritated throat a few days ago, because it rained, and I get allergies and post nasal drip that causes soreness constantly. She accepted that, did the eval, went fine.</p>
<p>4th. Go in for the Poly. Same question. THIS LADY immediately told me she had to go check upstairs and to hang on. Like 15 minutes later. She comes back and tells me she has to reschedule for 'covid concerns.' I tried to tell her I have allergies, in storms, and heck every morning I always get a scratch throat until it's cleared. I always get post nasal drip, it's an ongoing issue before and after Covid started and I had LITERALLY taken a PCR test at CVS before going on the trip.</p>
<p>But because it was slightly irritated, after the Covid test, it has to be rescheduled in 2 weeks. I live in Georgia. They had to pay for hotel and flight or mileage, just to get me up there. Now they expect to do it again...</p>
<p>Is this good precaution or were they overreacting as many have said? Also, I wasn't the only one that got turned away for that. Some other applicant dude I overheard had to reschedule for 'covid concerns' ...I had not gone near him all morning thank god, in case he actually had it. But... Like waiting a few days to take a covid test to give it like 4 days after my trip to see. But if it's negative... I just...  what do we do if we constantly get allergies??? Continue to reschedule? It rains in Georgia. Rain causes post-nasal drip. That causes itchy throats x.x.</p></p>

        <p>Stop telling them about every itch and sniffle you have. Problem solved. If you have no reason to believe you have an illness and you know you have a chronic allergy problem, stop creating obstacles for yourself.</p>

        <p>I answered yes because the appointment was for a polygraph so my mind was kind of focused on not lying about anything at that moment.</p>
<p>If I lied about symptoms before I thought I might accidentally lie in the test so I was focused on full truth and didn't think.</p>

        <p>Tell that to the U.S government. Despite the fact Penn and Teller completely debunked them as inaccurate. They for some reason still use them as part of the decision of whether you get a clearance or not.</p>

        <p>Eh.. while I do know after seeing it. They look for that, as the paper you sign permission to take it mentions any meds, mental, or physical attempts to change results will fail you immediately.</p>

        <p>Having worked closely with them in regards to the government, I will tell you that they're not able to be used in court because they're not accurate. The only way they use them is </p>
<p>1) with the permission of the suspect</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>2) as a tool to manipulate that suspect into thinking that the magical polygraph gave away their secrets. </p>
<p>Again, gov knows they're bullshit, that's why they're inadmissable as evidence. It's 100% a bluff used by police against weak-willed suspects who don't realize they're being played. Notice how all the polygraph ever does is get the suspect to confess? Check out the dumb fuck, Chris Watts. He was played so hard by the striped shirt lady lmfao</p>

        <p>If you know it’s allergy symptoms and not COVID symptoms, then you’re not lying. Just say that you have no COVID symptoms.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what other advice to give you. If you openly tell people you have COVID symptoms even if you know you don’t, then yes, they’re going to keep testing you for it all the time or quarantining you or whatever other ineffectual protocols they want to make your life harder with.</p>

        <p>They didn't ask "Do you have covid symptoms" and leave it at that. They asked "Do you have any of the symptoms of covid, and then listed off the symptoms they deemed to be covid." One of those being 'sore throat.'</p>
<p>I guess it could be argued irritated throat isn't the same definition as sore which I tried to tell her. But maybe it's not lying if going by exact definition hmm</p>

        <p>I understand that your disorder might cause you to hyperfocus on certain things like the symptoms that they list. But this is how it would go for me if I were certain that I am only experiencing chronic allergies:</p>
<p>“Do you have any symptoms of COVID: [symptoms listed as COVID].”</p>
<p>“No, I do not have any symptoms of COVID.”</p>
<p>I understand that what you’re going through is a moment of high pressure and I sympathize with that. However, you asked what you should do if you get chronic allergies, and this is my answer. You can either truthfully say that you have no COVID symptoms, or accept that you will be subjected to constant testing and other measures if you indicate that you may have COVID, even if you don’t have it.</p>

        <p>I agree. And despite being a lawyer, I care about being honest so much it gets me in trouble too lol. Go in calm - take a Benadryl to help with that and ur allergies lol - and I’ll think positive vibes for u! Congratulations for making this far and good luck!!  I struggle to stay positive myself, but I try to think things happen for a reason…maybe you wouldn’t actually like this job, so maybe apply to others in the time being. Ur a rockstar in my eyes b/c u were smart enough not to get the jab and I always wanted to have pink hair lol. 😀</p>

        <p>Taking 4000iu of Vitamin D and drinking an Emergen-C every day , then buying an oximeter and taking my oxygen and temperature throughout the day have helped relieve a lot of the fear of 'did i get it'. Still wear a mask unlike the folks in this sub. But it's helped reduce the panic at least.</p>

        <p>If there are I deemed it less important than getting vaccinated. The federal mandate said employees tested or vaxxed. I took it because I didn't know if that counted for employee applicants too or not. So it was just making sure I didn't get turned away.</p>

        <p>Before Covid. Saying you felt unwell was completely normal, in fact most people went to work unwell and show very little sympathy for them because they still had to work. You’d even sit next to them and catch it yourself without blaming them for giving it to you. Or, you would joke that they gave it to you. </p>
<p>These days you can’t tell anyone you feel ill and over the next few years we will all have to begin lying about feeling unwell.</p>
<p>“No, I’ve never been ill, last time I sneezed and farted at the same time was 1998.”</p>

        <p>Hey! I’m just like u! Isn’t it funny we’re hypochondriacs and didn’t get the vax! I have allergies and sinus issues all the time! When I had to fill out COVID questionnnaires for work, I just wrote I had no symptoms. I mean, everything is a symptom - hiccups, erectile dysfunction, losing hair, grey hair. If no taste is a symptom, I’ve had Fauci flu for most of my life based on the dudes I’ve dated lolol</p>

        <p>I'm the opposite of a hypochondriac. If they keep paying for expenses well look at it as getting free flights. I like planes. Don't you love flying? Look at it this way. You get to fly more. Flying is fun. Of all the human beings to ever have existed, you know not many of them have been 30,000 feet up in the sky.</p>
