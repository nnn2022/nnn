        <p>Indeed. This is called "Nazi exceptionalism," the idea that German people under the Nazi regime were uniquely bad and conformist, and no other people could possibly facilitate such evil. </p>
<p>On the other hand, "American exceptionalism" is the idea that Americans are uniquely <em>good</em> and <em>non-conformist</em>, and the American people could <em>never</em> facilitate such evil.</p>
<p>2020 has completely invalidated both concepts.</p>

        <p>It’s also by design. Think about how little is actually taught about the German mindset leading up to World War 2. You’d be lucky if your high school history teacher said “the treaty of Versailles was bad.” They don’t want people to know that it’s possible to reason with such an ideology. Imo, maybe they’re right, but I’d rather people know the dangers of becoming an ideologue.</p>

        <p>How many people have ever even seen the anti-semitist propaganda that was rife at the time? People think the Germans just woke up one day hating jews, but in reality, there was a constant barrage of lies and fearmongering thrown at them. The Jews are the reason you can't afford food, the jews are the reason Germany lost the war, the jews are the reason you have no job, etc. </p>
<p>Honestly, it's similar to how the media portrays any lockdown/restriction skeptical person. There's a very scary mentality that has popped up recently where people seem to think even questioning masks/lockdowns is leading to more spread. It doesn't matter if you're fully compliant with the rules, the simple act of disagreeing with these things is causing cases to spike. It's terrifying that people are subconsciously viewing COVID as this Krampus-like thing that's always listening and watching, just waiting for someone to talk shit about restaurant closures on Facebook.</p>

        <p>I actually have.  Back in junior high, I did some personal research into Nazi (and Soviet) propaganda, to try and understand the mindset that lead to that level of dehumanization (had I only waited another five years, I'd've found out firsthand, but that's neither here nor there). </p>
<p>One of my favorite pieces (odd to hear about a favorite piece of Nazi propaganda, but hear me out) was made to condemn a particular subculture of German youth which was <em>really</em> into Swing dancing and Jazz.  Naturally, this infuriated the Nazi leadership, since Jazz was influenced by not only Jews, but black people.  So they put out a poster of a hilariously stereotyped black guy in a suit with a star of David button, playing a saxophone.  Even before I looked up what the German words meant, I remember thinking "Okay, horribly racist?  Check.  Implying 'they're all working together against us'?  Check.  But isn't condemnatory [which, in retrospect, I thought wasn't a word, but my browser recognizes it]  propaganda supposed to make stuff look <em>less</em> cool?".</p>

        <p>I actually had a fantastic history teacher in high school who always taught beyond the textbook. She made sure not only to explain the event, but also the major things leading up to it. She also went over current events at the beginning of each class in order to facilitate healthy discussion among students.</p>
<p>This teacher was one of the only openly conservative teachers in the school. But she made it a point to just give context without personal bias. None of my liberal/leftist teachers did anything like that.</p>

        <p>Take it one step further. Why don't people know the financial interests behind wars, coups, terrorists etc? When you follow the money it's like opening Pandora's box. All of a sudden most things feel like fairytales. One of the big financiers behind Hitler was  a jew for example.</p>

        <p>it shows how great propaganda is, that such concepts even got to exist.</p>
<p>the reason, that they still exist today for most people is of course, because they won't ever learn the complete picture of history.</p>
<p>examples, that will be new to many people are for example:</p>
<p>the firebombing of dresden. a german civilian city, that  was over 0 military interest at all.</p>
<p>the allies bombed that city of civilians into the ground.</p>
<p>the eisenhauer ACTUAL deathcamps, where POWs  got thrown together and didn't get enough water or food and let them starve and die of dehydration.</p>
<p>then we have the japanese internment camps of course, where  people of japanese decent or who looked a bit asian i guess got thrown into and their rights sh1t on.  we're talking about usa concentration camps of people of a certain race or origin here.</p>
<p>and of course the unbelievable horror, that happened to the civilians after the allies captured  a region. the soviet site had soldiers who through propaganda didn't see those civilians as humans anymore and rape and murder  happened at immense scale.</p>
<p>so everything done by the naz1s got also done by the allies.</p>
<p>interesting to note here is, that researching the mentioned things might be quite easy, but for some reason, if you actually want to research   the basics about the  concentration camps of germany, then for some reason you will be hit with prison times.</p>
<p>researchers and book authors get thrown in prison and even lawyers doing their job in court to defend them get thrown in prison.</p>
<p>last time i checked truth doesn't fear questions, so why is one not allowed to properly research these damns camps in germany?</p>
<p>short article about what happened afterwards to the lawyer syvia stolz.</p>
<p>she gave a speech about   what was going on and the importance of free speech and stuff and for that speech the german traitor government put in prison for 18 months.</p>
<p>a speech in another country btw too.</p>
<p><a href="https://wir-sind-monika.com/2019/05/25/sylvia-stolz-incarcerated-for-a-speech/">https://wir-sind-monika.com/2019/05/25/sylvia-stolz-incarcerated-for-a-speech/</a> </p>
<p>this also shows our TRUE enemy. an enemy, that should unite us all.</p>
<p>it is the criminal traitor governments, that try to remove our freedoms and poison us and kill us as always.</p>
<p>research history, research it PROPERLY! and realize, that it is propaganda and governments, that are the true evil.</p>

        <p>No. The Holocaust happened as advertised, dresden was a response to the bombing of coventry.(don't start none, there won't be none) and I've never heard about the intentional starvation of german prisoners by eisenhower. Got a source on that?</p>
<p>The red army definitely did a whole lot of raping though, that's true.</p>

        <p>I hate masks because they always hike up my face and I have no choice but to try to adjust it. I’ve tried different ones and it always happens except for the teen sized one. But then the teen one presses against my nose too hard and annoys me.</p>
<p>I hate masks. I don’t know how these people love and adore them so much. I see so many comments about how they love how secure and safe their mask makes them feel and I’m just confused.</p>

        <p>i know i dont have to freak out so hard. gets really tiring to hear “the election was stolen and we’ll have evidence when we get it” which means there isn’t any currently, doesn’t it? peaceful transition of power =/= secure election because those are two completely different things. trump’s admin isn’t starting the process because they all have the mental capacity of children. stop pretending you took the red pill and are all knowing.</p>

        <p>While Nazis are an overused and extreme example, those who laugh at it and call it crazy aren't grasping the underlying point about human nature. </p>
<p>Look at the conformity in the USSR through the 1920's as collectivization got rolling. </p>
<p>Look at the conformity in China for the past 50 years. It's a tiny fraction that stood in Tienanmen Square.</p>

        <p>Saying mask wearing and genocide are the same was not my point; my point was that most people are compliant and will do anything their regime asks of them.<br>
And what will it lead to? The phasing out of physical currency on the grounds of covid-19, which will allow central banks to use negative interest rates and destroy your savings.<br>
Covid hysteria has <em>already lead to</em> the destruction of many of the reasons to keep on living (but if we could save just ONE life). Theatres, restaurants, holidaying, family gatherings, are either banned or resticted into some bizarre pantomime which hardly gives a moment of reprieve (that is another hallmark of totalitarian regimes, to involve itself in everything and deny its victims even mental escape).</p>

        <p>Oh dear oh dear. I do care what happens to others. I see more suffering from the things I mentioned in my previous comment (which you ignored, I see) who clearly don't matter to you because they're just the peasants who are there to deliver your food. Screeching about masks ain't helping anyone, you wear one if you want but it shouldn't be forced on everyone. </p>
<p>&rt; i wear a mask to protect others.</p>
<p>And like I said, playing hero to feed your ego while you watch the world burn and plug your ears.</p>

<p>it should be forced on everyone. america currently has alot of cases because some people don't give a shit and don't wear one.</p>

        <p>That is an interesting and scary quote. not quite a fact check tho</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>He was talking about free speech though not banning books. Similar but different!</p>
<p>Places like Canada dont even have free speech</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Freedom of expression in Canada</strong> is not absolute; <strong>Section 1</strong> of the <strong>Charter</strong> allows the government to pass laws that limit <strong>free expression</strong> so long as the limits are "reasonable and can be justified in a <strong>free</strong> and democratic society".</p>

        <p>I share your sentiments about Facebook.  But, some of my friends on Facebook only get their news from main stream media.  With Facebook I can give them opinions (or facts) they otherwise would never see.  Plus, I can post memes which hit them in an emotional way which I think is more effective than using a logical argument.</p>

        <p>Funny how every doomer here is comparing "a piece of cloth" to concentration camps when the picture shows just a simple greeting. Also the picture above wasn't a nazi salute
it was <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936_Summer_Olympics">olympic greeting from year 1936</a></p>

        <p>One thing that kind of annoys the crap out of me is that people act like they think this is the first time we're being lied to.<br>
Do you really think that WW2 happened as portrayed? Adolf Hitler even literally went up against the same kind of international interests and companies that are present today and are currently driving the covid campaign. He obviously lost since they're still here.<br>
And you still think WW2 happened as the story books tell it? </p>
<p>Please do some research on both sides of all matters. Just blindly trusting ANYTHING makes you part of the problem.</p>

        <p>It isn't a simple salute. If it was you wouldn't have posted it here. It's a salute which stands for years of pain and despair, oppression and millions of deaths. 
It's simply not comparable to having to wear a face mask because there's literally a worldwide pandemic going on.</p>

        <p>And yet, it's not a simple salute and masks aren't a sign of approval. 
Masks help us protect each other from not only COVID-19 but a number of other viruses. 
They weren't just invented by the government in response to the virus or in order to control us. 
They were first introduced in 1897 in Europe and were regularly used in operating rooms starting from the 1920s in the USA and several European countries. 
They were "invented" by a surgeon. Not by the government, not by some other authority figure but by one surgeon and spread due to lowered risks of infection and not because people were told to wear one. 
The comparison you're making is complete bs. 
What are you trying to say, anyway? That every single doctor starting from the 1920s has been brainwashed to wear a face mask during surgery? That the lowered risk of infection is just propaganda? Or maybe that COVID-19 is? Have you maybe been to a hospital recently, to the ICU where people are literally dying due to COVID-19?
The only thing that's brainwashed is this community here, it's full of delusional people like you making comparisons that simply don't work, spreading misinformation and using research papers as evidence that have been disproven several times. 
I would actually tell you to believe whatever you want if you weren't actually endangering others with your ignorant perspective on things blinded by some delusion that's causing you to not be able to think for yourself or do some research on this whole topic.</p>

        <p>though one image primarily depicts a body part and a racist ideal in the making of the gesture, the other is a depiction of a piece of cloth used with intent to respect someone else’s health.
perhaps comparing images of people performing the Salute to images of people standing on dots spaced 6 ft apart would make a more succinct and powerful representation.. just saying.</p>

        <p>Ok, I'm all for working towards a return to normalcy after covid is beaten, but holy shit you guys. I thought this was a meme for a second and went to the comments looking for a good laugh. Not the dead-faced seriousness of people equating mask-wearers to brainwashed nazis, You guys gotta pull back a bit if you think wearing a mask is the same as goddamn naziism.</p>

        <p>Y’all are really something special.</p>
<p>Do you guys not see the difference of an actual virus that is killing and maiming people compared to an ideology of hate and oppression.  If you showed a Trump rally and then the top photo I could believe this.  The world isn’t lying about this. There is a big problem with authoritarian populists brainwashing naive, under educated folk though.</p>
<p>Y’all are so close to the truth, but for some reason cannot see that you have been conned all along. </p>
<p>Seek mental help. Conspiracy theorists are more likely to suffer from severe mental illness. It is nice and fuzzy for your brain to find something to blame the big bad world on. So you look for evidence of your bizarre realties and you find it because it is what you want. Everything. Has a smidge of truth to it, y’all just dilute it. You are not someone special with secret knowledge. I promise you. Y’all just cannot cope with reality so you go into your own fantasy worlds. It’s okay. It’s the truth and maybe something you should look into.</p>

        <p>Wrong. The point is showing how everyone thinks every person in Germany was a Nazi and hated Jews because they saluted Hitler. They think “oh they should have just not done what the government told them to do” yet they are no different since they immediatly follow everything the government tells them to do no questions asked and frame everyone who doesn’t as a piece of garbage who wants to kill grandma in the nursing home.</p>
<p>I know a man who was forced to be in Hitler’s army. He did not want to be there and was vehmently against everything Hitler stood for, but his only other choice was to die. His family was very Christian and refused to do the salute to Hitler. They were persecuted and had to live in fear throughout Hitler’s reign.</p>

        <p>Exactly, people don’t understand that Nazi’s didn’t just appear out of thin air, it was during a period of 10-15 years that their hate and brainwashing grew, if you compare where we are now to 8 months into where the nazi’s were we’re probably not far off</p>

        <p>It’s not specific to health measures.  Today it’s “just wear a mask”. When, in months, the situation is the same, it becomes “just wear a mask and gloves”.  Just like public lockdowns turn into “suspended private gatherings”</p>

<p>There is a lot of truth to this though.</p>
<p>How many people have you heard say something like "I hope all those anti-maskers just die" and laugh when a denier dies from Covid on the news?</p>
<p>The are <em>exactly</em> the same kind of people who would be wishing that all the Jews got a taste of their own medicine (they were "making Germany sick", after all!).  And they would be clapping their hands behind their curtain as their neighbour got carted away for listening to allied radio.</p>
