    <strong>Msm is already stretching the truth in India...</strong>
    <p><p>While we are still gathering the evidence, msm has already decided for us on all the recent news going down in India. Dozens of floating bodies not yet confirmed if they’re related to COVID? Hundreds of COVID dead tossed into the Ganges. Relatively low deaths and cases last year and the spike coincides with a mass vaccination push? New monster variant. Fungal infection reported in some of Covid-19 positive patients that is likely a comorbidity/complication? Covid-19 suppressed immune system and caused the fungal infection to happen. </p>
<p>Trust the science! Don’t point out how a lot of hypotheses from last year have been mostly debunked keep spraying down your fruits with antiseptic!</p></p>

        <p>Everything I have read about these wonky spike proteins says that they could compromise your immune system specifically regarding fungal infections. I had not heard that there has been a "surge" in fungal infections in India until you just mentioned it. That puzzle is building itself... The shit hit the fan right along with their mass vaccinations...</p>
