    <strong>Do any of you know anyone who contracted COVID?</strong>
    <p><p>What was the outcome?</p>
<p>Just stumbled across this sub. I'm curious if you all think COVID is a hoax or just believe that masks don't make you any safer or what.</p>
<p>What's the consensus here? COVID isn't real? or it was created in a lab in China?</p></p>

        <p>The Sars-CoV-2 virus is almost certainly a unique virus, albeit with however many thousands of known variants.</p>
<p>COVID is the disease associated with this virus.  Testing positive for RNA doesn't mean you have covid, because disease is defined by being sick.  If you have no symptoms, you don't have covid.</p>
<p>I've known a ton who tested positive, and quite a few who have had symptoms similar to those associate with covid, which can generally not be distinguished from a cold or mild flu.  I know a couple who were actually hospitalized with both test and symptoms indicative of severe covid (both older and in poor health, obviously).</p>
<p>Most here believe the virus exists and has killed some people.</p>
<p>Whether it was created in a lab, intentionally or otherwise, is a separate issue orthogonal both to the above and to the handling of the virus.  (Well, mostly.  If it was created intentionally, it means even moreso that we should not destroy our society for this because there could more easily be further releases.)</p>
<p>There really hasn't been enough good information released to the public to assess the origin, and there may never be.</p>

        <p>The second paragraph is wrong. Most people do not have 'no' symptoms. They have very minor symptoms that they mistake for seasonal allergies or simply 'feeling under due to the change in weather' and they go out and infect other people, including people with pre-existing.</p>
<p>That is where the danger of viral diseases like CoVid-19 comes from: You can have it, mistake the symptoms for something else, and spread it to a vulnerable person.</p>
<p>That said, we have never done lockdowns and masking of this form since the 1918 flu pandemic and even then, lockdowns were dismissed as being too harsh and counterproductive.</p>

        <p>&rt; "most people"</p>
<p>Most of which people?  Most of those tested?  Those with positive results?  How many cycles?  Most of those exposed?</p>
<p>You don't actually have this data.  And you can't, because you can't separate tests that can be positive weeks or months after exposure from all the other colds floating around.  How many really did have other colds, allergies, or the dozen other things that manifest similarly?</p>
<p>And....I didn't even say that.  I said, "Testing positive for RNA doesn't mean you have covid, because disease is defined by being sick. If you have no symptoms, you don't have covid."  This is simply the definition of disease.</p>

        <p>Yep: My mother and father and both died from it.</p>
<p>CoVid-19 is not a scam. The SARS-CoV-2 virus does exist.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/grows-virus-cell-culture.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/grows-virus-cell-culture.html</a></p>
<p>There is no denying this.</p>
<p>However the response to this virus is stupid because if you are truly healthy, meaning not running low on Vit. C, Vit. D and Zinc like both my mother and father were AND are not a transplant patient and/or recently had major surgery (recently meaning in the last 6 months) like Dad and got this virus?</p>
<p>You are not likely to die from this virus. The survival rate for it is 99.8% in the general populace. That is better than numerous colds and flus from 2000-2018, something that the CDC and NIH have been trying to hide from people.</p>
<p>Add into this that lockdowns are known to have massive negative effects on the poor and lower-middle class and you have to question at least the lockdowns.</p>

        <p>These are the same symptoms ppl are getting from the vaccine and they all say it was worth it and still getting the second dose. I’m not sure how they can justify shutting down society for the same symptoms they were happy to get from a shot.</p>

My grandmother lives with my aunt who works at the hospital which is "overrun with COVID patients" my grandma is perfectly fine. She literally does not give a shit. Would you at 96? She would rather spend the rest of her life being able to do her regular routines and see her family.</p>

        <p>Yes, many actually. And I have a friend who is an MD and has also treated many covid patients, with one or more who actually died.  That said....only a SMALL percentage of people are at risk for death or severe complications.  For the rest of us of ANY age, if we are relatively healthy it’s legit a flu.</p>

        <p>I got shit for this and im prolly gonna get shit for this on this sub but here we goooo</p>
<p>I think its real. Its like the flu tho. Ppl at work had it. My boss is chinese and her family flew from china (one province down from wuhan) right as it was announced here in the states. Other people at work traveled to china and vitnam before the lockdowns. Everyone at work got sick. Was just like the flu but with a constant caugh and everyone at work said something along the lines of "feels different than the flu but its like the flu". </p>
<p>I also started getting ill out of nowhere from being in the same office as them for a few weeks. But i didnt care. But even i can tell you that even tho what i was getting felt lile the flu it was much quicker. Within 1hour i got fevel chills fatugue and weakness. Buuuuut this is where i always got shitted on for.</p>
<p>I went to store bought some gingwr lemons and limes. Juiced up those babies and drank a cup. Gave a cup to my girl too. By the end of the night i was feeling almost like it nevwr happened. My girl never even got it...and i kissed her while i was falling ill with those sympoms. </p>
<p>My dad got the flu covid too. He tested negative tho. But even he said it was like the flu but different. He is a worker and whwn he was ill he could barely keep a breath in him. He got exhaused just by walking to the mailbox and back. Anyway i told him to try ginger lemon and lime. I kept on telling him but he hardly ever listens. But when he wasnt getting better he tried it. Within 2 days he was back to work.</p>
<p>Another sotry i just found out about. The president of tanzania seemed to have done the same with his son....</p>
<p>https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/19/tanzanias-president-shrugs-off-covid-19-risk-after-sending-fruit-for-tests</p>
<p>So yeah. Lile grandma said. When you habe the flu take your vitamins and eat your soup. That advice has been better to me than taking an mrna vaccine.</p>

        <p>Yes, I know several people who have contracted it.  Symptoms ranged from nothing to a pretty rough 2 weeks at home.  I have heard of people who have had people die from it, but most of those cases have been elderly or ill individuals.</p>
<p>It is a real virus, but I feel that the response has been nothing more than political fodder.  I have extreme concerns about the impact of lockdowns in forms of delayed care, mental health issues, poverty.</p>

        <p>I've had a neighbor die from it, or from one of his several other pre existing issues, but he definitely tested positive well before. It's absolutely real, but grossly overblown by the media. The masks don't do shit, but if they make some people feel better then go ahead and wear them. However absolutely no one is going to force me to wear one.</p>

        <p>Wife "had Covid."</p>
<p>Slept right next to her and everything and never got sick.
She had flu-like symptoms for a few days, lost her sense of taste and smell. 
Still complains of heaviness in the chest and shortness of breath.
Refuses to use an inhaler (wtf?) To open bronchial airways just that little extra.
Mom was diagnosed too, but never fell ill.</p>
<p>I believe that the a virus did escape from a Chinese lab, and they labelled it "COVID" at some point.
I believe that it is contagious, but it is just like the regular seasonal flu, and that it has been politicized in order to effect the election.
I believe that the whole mask thing, (masks literally do nothing except collect bacteria that people are forced to breathe back in, and if there were no masks, the bacteria would be exhaled and would die after it was exposed to air and/or sunlight) social distancing, and the closing of public spaces, to include retail stores did nothing to stop the spread of this virus, but it effectively ruined the economies of many countries, while Amazon made bank....again.</p>
<p>I don't wear a mask unless it's federally mandated. Local cops don't care. Either do I. F--- Klaus Schwab</p>

        <p>Virus is 100% real. I know a handful of people who have tested positive. Only person who had to be hospitalized was my moms friend. All that happened was fluids from an IV and out in a couple hours. Everyone else is 20 something. All they had was loss of taste/smell and maybe minor fatigue. </p>

        <p>Good for your family and workplace. However in the real world nearly 25% of the populace at large who are not obese are actually hypertensive, as I was at 18 years of age when I weighed 170 pounds.</p>
<p>Since becoming what the doctors would say is 'severely overweight'? My HBP has actually decreased. Explain that if you can.</p>
<p>As to being diabetic? Nope.</p>
<p>As to prior lung issues? Nope.</p>
<p>What happened when I got CoVid-19? Knocked me on my rear for 4 days in my father's La-Z-Boy, made me cough up blood (only a small amount admittedly), made my heart literally feel like it was burning for the 2 middle days in the La-Z-Boy, and the last day gave me a whopper of a nosebleed with no warning that literally soaked a 5"x5" section of a bath towel.</p>
<p>Yeah... I would call those symptoms moderate or low-severe.</p>

        <p>Yes, 2 people and both went into the hospital for a couple days to be put on oxygen. Part of the reason I think they went is because the programmed fear. I honestly think if it was normal flu season they may have toughed it out at home. Both were over 60 and both would be considered obese in the BMI scale or at the very top of the overweight. Both came out of the hospital after 2-3 days tops and recovered fine from what I know. One has become extra fearful now, I’m not sure about the other.</p>

        <p>My brother but he was asymptomatic. His baby mama, but symptoms were mild which was the reason he got tested in the first place. Had another friend catch it as well as his son but it was mild. An ex girlfriend from middle school caught a severe case and she claims she was close to death but no ventilator, fully recovered. My step mom's brother caught something but tested negative. Step mom is sure he got it bit was misdiagnosed, she's a retired nurse and has bought fully into the narrative. Couple of more friends older relatives have caught it but none have passed that didn't have any underlying health issues. I hung out with my brother all day after his positive results and never caught it as far as I know. My brother was not impressed, thought he'd be a lot sicker instead we went and did some intense landscaping and had acouple of beers on the way home.</p>

        <p>My 1 year old daughter and i got covid in July. She had a very mild cold. I had mild pneumonia, high fever, body aches etc. 
The virus IS real, the hype, way blown out of the water IMO. It sucked to have it and i believe me being anxious made it much worse.
I was normal 2 weeks later.</p>

        <p>Yes, four people I knew personally, youngest was 27 and oldest 65. Nothing happened. Three basically had a cold and one said it was more like flu. They stayed home and rested like with any other cold or flu and then they were fine.</p>
<p>I think it's real, but it's been extremely exaggerated. It's not a deadly pandemic worth being scared over, it's a new strain of cold, and it hits a little harder than other colds (sometimes) because nobody's been exposed to it before.</p>

        <p>My whole family was in florida on vacation when everyone got it. My mom and dad got real bad symptoms that lasted for about a week. Stuffed up fever, god aweful cough and shit in their chest, sore throat. The cough and fever was the worst.  Both are in their late 60s. They came out of it fine with no long term effects whatsoever. My cousin lost his sense of taste and had the sniffles but that was it. Me and my husband were the only ones who never got it. Nadda. I remember always drinking out of everyones waterbottles by mistake thinking it was mine cause I would leave mine all over the house. I chew my fingernails regularly. I dont use sanitizer. I wash my hands when I need to but that's it. I couldnt catch it if I tried</p>

        <p>I know a few people who got it. All but one are fully recovered. The other is, I think, mostly recovered but still suffering some fatigue and other symptoms. (She has had bronchitis for years.)</p>
<p>I believe SARS-CoV-2 is real. I suppose the story of someone eating a bat or pangolin may be true, but I suspect it came from a lab by accident. I think maybe the Chinese were studying naturally occuring SARS in bats and accidentally let it out.</p>

        <p>I think there are some settings in which wearing masks may help prevent spread but I believe that in the vast majority of settings they do little good (and actually spread more germs). Restaurants are one of the worst places to wear them. It is generally unsanitary and disgusting to wear them in restaurants because people continually touch them.</p>

        <p>My sister in law and her husband had it last summer. It was like a flu except for the loss of smell that lasted a month.  My brother in law is "at risk", he's diabetic and had recently had a large chunk of liver removed due to a tumour.</p>
<p>They're both fine now, except that my brother in law got no follow-ups at the hospital because of the covid panic. He had to fight for months to get a scan to check on his cancer. When he finally did, they found another tumour that is now too large to be operated on. </p>
<p>I know another 3 people who are missing out on critical medical care because hospitals are considering anything that isn't covid as non essential. The response to this virus is lowering the general health of the population, but of course we never see those stats on the media</p>
