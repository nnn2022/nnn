    <strong>Finally had my first experience with a masker confronting me for not wearing one today.</strong>
    <p><p>So my mom is visiting me from out of town a d we decided to go to a local botanical garden to have a nice walk. There were a fair amount of people there, mostly wearing masks, except for my mom and I. Signs only said that masks were required if you couldn't keep a 6 ft distance, which was fairly easy. No big deal.</p>
<p>We had a nice stroll and were walking out in the parking lot back to the car when a woman with her dog was walking towards me on the sidewalk. She was maybe 10-15 ft from me and I heard her say "would you put a mask on?". Realizing she was talking to me I simply replied, "oh I have a medical exemption" and kept walking.  She really was taken aback by my response and then said either "I have covid" or "I had covid". I didn't really hear what she specifically said as I just repeated my statement and crossed the road to get to my car. I heard her mumbling to herself as she walked away.</p>
<p>Then I thought about what she said and if she said she HAS covid currently, then isn't that way more irresponsible to be outside where other people are than someone without a mask on? Shouldn't she be at home quarantining? But if she said she HAD covid, in the past tense, then...congrats? You're one of the 99% who survived. I really don't understand the point she was trying to make with her statement but I just said my peace and walked away. </p>
<p>It was strange to finally be confronted about not wearing a mask...especially when I'm outside...in a park. She definitely wasn't expecting me to give her the response I did, I could tell she was genuinely surprised. I'm really tired of living in this bullshit world with masks and people treating no maskers like lepers.</p></p>

        <p>This happened to me once while hiking in a remote mountain. The guy and his dog leaped away from me, and just shook their head at me. </p>
<p>This was even before mask mandates. </p>
<p>I guess its whatever. I can respect that they probably didnâ€™t expect to run into anyone in the wilderness and chose to go their for that reason.</p>
