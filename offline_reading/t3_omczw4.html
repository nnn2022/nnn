    <strong>My Husband’s mother may be trying to get him to get vaccinated. What to do?</strong>
    <p><p>My husband respects his mother’s advice and looks up to her. A few weeks ago, they had a long conversation on the phone which resulted in him taking a trip to the pharmacy as I overheard them talking about the vaccine. I wasn’t trying to listen but we live in a studio apartment, so when he returned I asked him about it and he said that he all of a sudden may want to get it, even though before he would outwardly exclaim that he didn’t care much about it and deemed it unnecessary. I simply asked him why all of a sudden, and he says he doesn’t know and that he is just thinking about it and may do research. He already knows how much I dislike the whole covid vax situation and that I won’t get it, so he assured me that it is something he would bring to me first before making a decision.</p>
<p>He took another trip to the pharmacy today after another long conversation his mom, but this time he didn’t want to say where he was going until I asked him a second time after heading out the door. I worry he will go ahead and get it without telling me since he wants to please his mother, but I worry more for potential side effects.</p>
<p>We have been quite healthy since the start of covid and haven’t been sick once. What should I do?</p></p>

<p>He himself originally had the moderna vaccine but now has researched it and has brought up many good points . Avoid the current 3 vaccines! </p>

        <p>I'd say I don't mind if you get the vaccine but don't hide it from me just so I know where we stand. Gotta respect the man's personal choices, even if he is being guilt tripped by his mom.
Alternatively how big of an issue is this? Is it a deal breaker? If not I'd just let him get on with it.</p>

        <p>How’s getting the vaccine responsible?</p>
<p>They don’t prevent you from getting Covid, they don’t prevent you from spreading Covid, they are worthless against variants, it’s also growing apparent that their efficacy is short lived and the supposed reduction in hospitalizations and death are also proving more dubious with each passing week.</p>
<p>That’s not even counting the tail risk of any long term side effects which are unknown.</p>
<p>Now say he does get it and something goes wrong.</p>
<p>He can’t sue the manufacturer.</p>
<p>Most health insurance companies will not cover the injury related costs due to it only having EUA approval.</p>
<p>If he was forced to get it by his employer there’s no requirement they file a workers comp claim if he suffers a serious side effect.</p>
<p>So given all that information.  </p>
<p>How’s it more responsible to get this vaccine?</p>
<p>Especially considering a 99.7% survival rate.</p>
