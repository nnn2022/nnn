    <strong>Why they are pushing for FDA approval</strong>
    <p><p>Here is why there pushing for it and wanting it approved and rushed. </p>
<p>Is because they want to infect your children next. But they can't to this without the FDA sticker of approval. </p>
<p>There still testing people &amp; kids on pfizer trials, I only had a glance ( so I can be sure age is right) but is said 3 years old to 12 ( i could be wrong) </p>
<p>These trials are going till 2023 than more trials for the booster jabs. Around 2022 upwards.</p>
<p>While there only Eua approved there still not safe. For anybody. </p>
<p>So while the vaccinated are queuing for it. And waiting for the jab. </p>
<p>The actually mice that had it in pfizer on the trials before humans, like the trial humans I mean in pfizer than the humans that they got queuing up for old / etc. </p>
<p>The mice suffered badly its immune system gave in..</p>
<p>So another mice was tested on and they gave the jab a tweak. This mice suffered seizures. </p>
<p>When you get these human trial patient for pfizer and your getting paid to test these jabs to see ( if there working) hense the word tried and tested . There not allowed to disclose any information. From really bad side effects etc. Oh I wonder why that is. The more you pay someone the more the won't be a whistle blower. </p>
<p>Advertised at the moment are flu camps ( no this is not for flu ) it's for the trial booster vaccines which you will have for life ) and someone who wants to make a quick buck will jump up the chance not knowing there safe or then side effects or perment  damage. </p>
<p>They can FDA approved it all they like. And rush it. But they saying if they do it will sway people to have it ( not a chance in hell ) </p>
<p>Just because you put something that has an approveal sticker on it don't mean its still safe. </p>
<p>You created a vaccine , and in your own words said, it won't ( or might protect you from the virus) but guess what people having jabs got covid. Its not a good jab is it.. and your information says it builds up the immune system to fight it off. </p>
<p>Well what do you think me and every un vaxx person has been doing. Fighting it off and we have not had it.. why ? Oh yeah because we not had jabby jab. </p>
<p>I know people whom had covid ..by not having a jab. Been held up in bed for a week or 2 felt like shit. Hydrated themselves ate well. Got more supplements and over come it and now there immune system has built it up to fight it off.</p>
<p>P.s don't put this shit anywhere near you kids its still dangerous even if it does have a magic FDA approved sticker when they do get it</p></p>

        <p>Pretty obvious why they want to get fda approval. If it's fda approved they can mandate it. Next comes vaccine passports...welcome to medical aparthied.</p>
