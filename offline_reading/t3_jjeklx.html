    <strong>A Small Win</strong>
    <p><p>My university has, like most organizations across the West, been positively excited to jump headfirst in the 'new normal.' In our dorms, there is an area to play ping pong, but they have always required masks. When I tried to play without one earlier this semester, I was 'reminded' by the floor RAs to put it back on during two separate occasions.</p>
<p>But tonight, for the second time in a row when I went to play with my roommate, everyone left us alone. We played happily for an hour, uninterrupted, as people passed by in the halls. </p>
<p>Slowly, but surely, people are beginning to get bored of the restrictions as they realize that there aren't mass graves, that this isn't really pandemic. Masks are an ineffectual deterrent for a disease that is not all that deadly. It's heartening to see.</p></p>

<p>227K deaths from a viral disease that's less than a year old in the US alone. Think about that and really question if that is worth risking being part of that number by refusing to wear a mask.</p>

<p>Show me evidence that they work and I can give you 2x evidence from studies that they don’t work.</p>

        <p>Which doctors are you talking about? The doctors the government listens to are a very small group of doctors who receive an extremely large portion of funding and company direction from Bill Gates who has serious skin in the game for a vaccine.</p>
<p>If you do even a little bit of homework you will find many highly qualifified doctors and researchers who have come to the opposite conclusion. You will also find that they have all been censored upon trying to publish said research because "it goes against public health interest" That translates to anybody that tries to run research on this subject won't be taken seriously unless they come to the pre determined answer, regardless of facts.</p>
<p>If you consider a mandatory vaccine for everyone in the US @ 200 dollars a shot, you can clearly see that a single round of vaccinations will almost equal the US debt.</p>
<p>Before discounting NoNewNormal I highly encourage you to look at this from the other side and try to put your pre conceptions aside and look at it objectively, you may be surprised. (basically, look at anything but news sites, opinion pieces, government sites and cdc). There is LOTS Of material available as to who has interested in this new normal and why. There are also many top epidemiologists and doctors from reputable universities saying what the government, big pharma and the media don't want you to hear.</p>

        <p>Sure. What do you consider "reliable"? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also, to add to my point:</p>
<p>If you don't remember, health officials recommended smoking cigarettes for health benefits many years ago. They knew they were bad.</p>
<p>Government officials also recommended residential schools for aboriginals for everyone best interest.</p>
<p>Also... the Vietnam war.</p>
<p>Those are a few tiny reasons why myself and many others take the government and medias word with a grain of salt, especially when you factor the money of mega corps into the equation.</p>

        <p>The fact is public perception believes in masks to such a point where you could have all the evidence in the world they don't work, and they don't believe you. If a doctor said this they would risk losing their job, even if they presented irrefutable information. Is this fair to say?</p>
<p>This mask crusade has nothing to do with science. </p>
<p>Are you aware there are countless studies done on virus transmission through masks in the past 50 years with evidence that they work completely inconclusive. This includes coronaviruses. Keep in mind, these studies for masks and virus transmissions use surgical masks which are designed to be thrown out every 2 hours, not home made cotton masks.</p>
<p>Suddenly in one month this does a 360 and changes completely without any groundbreaking new research coming out. The WHO and CDC suddenly recommended they work.</p>
<p>Every one jumps on board. Any study against them gets buried. Anyone of any level of education with any proof says anything about them and they get shamed.</p>

        <p>Because if everyone wasn't wearing masks, the public would forget about the virus, and we can't have that... the government would then lose control. that would bring things back to normal, which isn't as profitable as 4 mandatory vaccines a year for every single citizens for several years at $200 a piece now would it</p>

<p>I find myself especially interested in a set of quotes from the CDC and one of the above sources.</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0714-americans-to-wear-masks.html</p>
<p>“We are not defenseless against COVID-19,” said CDC Director Dr. Robert R. Redfield. “Cloth face coverings are one of the most powerful weapons we have to slow and stop the spread of the virus – particularly when used universally within a community setting. All Americans have a responsibility to protect themselves, their families, and their communities.”</p>
<p>If you search for the word "cloth" on that page, it will come up 13 times. The CDC insists upon cloth masks in particular. However...</p>
<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4420971/</p>
<p>"We have provided the first clinical efficacy data of cloth masks, which suggest HCWs should not use cloth masks as protection against respiratory infection. Cloth masks resulted in significantly higher rates of infection than medical masks, and also performed worse than the control arm. The controls were HCWs who observed standard practice, which involved mask use in the majority, albeit with lower compliance than in the intervention arms. The control HCWs also used medical masks more often than cloth masks. When we analysed all mask-wearers including controls, the higher risk of cloth masks was seen for laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infection."</p>
<p>I believe that whenever someone brings up the CDC, this may serve as a good topic to respond with.</p>

        <p>I read 2 of these so far and For the one you said multiple phd holders say masks are ineffective. This article is stupid, it says in it that a mask isn’t going to protect you if the droplet goes to your eye, well of course a mask won’t protect your eyes it does not cover your eyes but want to know what would protect you from that? staying 6 feet away. and that brings me to my next point, those so called “phd” holders are acting like masks are the only thing being used to prevent covid, When we do multiple things to prevent it. wearing a mask does not save you if you are really close up to somebody, that’s why people stay 6 feet away. the other one I read is the first one and I just want you to read how it was written. you can clearly tell some random person with no knowledge made that. he says “I” multiple times in it and you are not supposed to personalize those sort of things we are doing these argument essays currently in school and that is one of the basic rules. and also he doesn’t even prove anything he just says he finds info on stuff. i’ll read the article links you sent but I doubt any of them will be good.</p>

        <p>What? If anything the sites you sent were opinion pieces. You could tell by how they wrote it. one of the sources I sent was the official Canada website not sure how you think things like these are opinion pieces. and also your not supposed to be wearing dirty masks. Medical masks literally get thrown out after each use your not supposed to reuse them and also cloth masks are supposed to be cleaned after each use. Of course if your wearing a mask that is not hygienic it can harm you but if you make sure your mask is clean then your fine</p>

<p>WHO and CDC Are big organizations. and do you think I support masks just because the government does? I support masks because they work. and also what sources do you want the government to use, rcread? WHO and CDC Are reliable sources and it’s not random people people that are in those organizations, it’s EXPERTS that are in them. meanwhile you have sources you sent where a single person writes it that isn’t even a medical expert.</p>

        <p>Please tell me it did not just say low risk people should be able to resume life normally.. First off, young people are still going to school, they can go to in person school when they must wear a mask and social distance or they can go to online school. it can take up to 2 weeks to start developing symptoms from covid, and during that time you can still spread the virus to everyone else and these kids are going to go home to where there parents are and keep in mind that parents can be high risk. My dad has type 2 diabetes and if he is to get covid it’s not going to be good for him.. not all old people live in retirement homes my my uncle takes care of my grandma and my other grandparents are in Jordan they are not in a retirement home either they are also at high risk. </p>
<p>almost 6000 people died of covid in sweden...</p>

        <p>Those deaths happened during the epidemic which is long since over. Have a look at Sweden's covid 19 death graph on Google.</p>
<p>5000 deaths in a population of 10.23 million. 90% of those deaths happened during the epidemic. That is an 0.05 death rate across the board, and that is not counting the asymptomatic people who weren't tested. So if you count the death rate in a monthly fashion, they are set</p>
<p>If we focused on our nutrition, happiness and fitness .... all you need to do. Oh, and protect the vulnerable. (free n95 masks, free delivery, etc etc) while the population builds immunity. Problem solved.</p>

        <p>But a lot of that could have been avoided take a look at japan for example they have way bigger of a population than sweden and they have less deaths, and covid cases people just simply followed rules they wore masks they stayed 6 feet away and stuff. </p>
<p>And what do you mean “build” immunity? your saying they should just get covid to become immune to it? oh my I shouldn’t even need to explain why that’s a bad idea</p>
<p>You also need to stop acting like governments listen to cdc. the smart ones do listen to them and they won’t have lots of covid cases. just look at the USA they have a ridiculous amount of cases of you were to ask a medical expert what they think about USA’s covid response they would say it was horrible</p>

        <p>Like we have done ever since the human race existed? 50 million lives were taken away by the spanish flu but I guess that is necessary to “build immunity” the black death that killed 1/3 of Europe i guess that was necessary to “build immunity” Not all young people are safe from covid you know, not all of them are healthy or fit some have medical problems and stuff and even if we were just able to give it to the healthy ones, do you know that cruel that is? giving it to the youth? Have you told any youth of this solution? if they would be ok with that? No you have not i’m probably the only 14 year old your telling this “immunity building” thing to. And even though i’m perfectly healthy I can garentee that me, and anyone else of my age would never agree to something like this you need to think about the people who will be exposed to covid and think how they would feel about this</p>
<p>and what about teachers? if people resume normal life and start going to school without any social distancing rules, then what would happen to the teachers? they could be high risk what about them?</p>

        <p>The spanish flu deaths were primarily due to bacterial pneumonia, not the virus. Fortunately we can enjoy our dirty masks today because we have anti biotics. Did you know Spanish flu never really went away? It is H1N1, another pandemic that had a vaccine rushed that didn't end up working and causing damages to people... then it just disappeared into the yearly flu.</p>
<p>And I would be much more sad of wrecking masses of youth psychologically from lock downs and masks than such a harmless virus. What are death rates you might wonder:</p>
<p>0-19 years: 0.00003
20-49 years: 0.0002
50-69 years: 0.005
70+ years: 0.054
source: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html</p>
<p>So we are literally <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2020/05/18/isolated-and-lonely-caged-seniors-driven-to-despair-and-defiance.html">locking seniors in care homes in their room</a> with no contact. They don't even want to live anymore. All in the guise to save them. And we are depriving young people of the best time of their life. Each month passes these stats get better and better. With record suicides, depression, untreated cancer because the media has people too scared to go out and sooooooo many other bad things as a result.</p>
<p>But whatever dude. I know you feel like you are doing the right thing and very well researched for your age.. I probably would have thought the same as you, agreeing with the whole reddit bandwagon and feeling good about myself because of it, walking around with my friends with masks.. but as you gain life experience you may change in directions you never thought yourself going and have a view on life of someone you would have previously thought was stupid.</p>
<p>It is obvious for 80% of the population "masks work" and if everyone wore one there would be no virus.
There are 20% of the population who see that there are far too many things that don't add up. </p>
<p>And the core argument for me isn't even about whether masks work or not (science has said they don't up until the government and cdc decided they do). If governments can keep citizens wearing masks, and the media keeps everyone on edge with "Cases" it keeps everyone in a state of compliance, ready to take the next order.</p>
<p>The next order will be lockdowns, then the next order will be vaccines, then the next item on the table will be digital passports with vaccination record. Businesses won't let you in without scanning you have been vaccinated. Then maybe one day you won't even be able to receive a paycheque without it.</p>
<p>Now in a perfect world, this is a good thing. But we should have choice in what we put in our body. This opens up the world of the government testing on it's citizens. <a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/u-s-secretly-tested-carcinogen-in-western-canada-during-the-cold-war-researcher-discovers">This would NOT be the first time.</a> There have been so many vaccines over the years with deadly side effects and a big media has pushed "anti vaxxers" into the spotlight as the bad guy. What this means, is if you refuse a vaccine that IS in fact harmful, you are an anti vaxxer idiot. </p>
<p>It is a very delicate bridge that once we cross we won't come back from and even if this was with good intentions, which I don't believe for one second it is, will set a precedent in the future that we have to do whatever the government wants under the guise of public health. And if you say it is a bad idea, you are a bad person who wants other people to die. That is total control. </p>
<p>Now sure, if everyone is playing by the rules, it would be amazing if we had digital health passports and complete government control. Pandemic response would be incredible and we would be in a position to survive so much more that came at us. The problem is, there always has been and always will be corruption at every level. Money talks. </p>
<p>It starts with a mask and ends with loss of freedom. As some people say... "muh freedoms"</p>
<p>Bonus sci fi plot: We all have to wear a heart rate / bio monitoring smart watch to monitor our health as part of a mass surveillance program necessary to keep healthy citizens "for our safety". Who would say anything bad about "science"? Doctors said it was for our safety. They can now tell how my heart rate reacts to videos of questionable content, according to their plan. I am now a terrorist and public health threat.</p>
<p>This sounds ridiculous and sci fi but seriously this is the direction we are headed. Watch some black mirror. Read 1984. Read Brave New World.  </p>
<p>I hope you understand a little bit more where some of us are coming from. And I have never believed in any conspiracy theory or mistrusted governments before. I believe many vaccines are very good but I believe others are not necessary but I believe it should be the individuals choice.</p>

        <p>What is happening people in retirement homes is horrible, there should be something done about that but if we use this imunity building plan it probably wont change how things for them are currently. You need to understand that just because the youth will be low risk to covid does not mean people around around them will be low risk as well. My dad is high risk to covid so if i were to get covid i wouldn’t know until up to 2 weeks that I have it. and during that time it will spread to others my dad will get it along with the rest of my family. not only that but my classmates or any one i have interacted with has a chance of getting it. once they get it, it will spread to their family as well and anyone they have interacted with for up to 2 weeks once they know they have covid and self isolate. but this could happen to everyone until they realize they have covid. and let’s say that retirement homes allowed visitors. and we had this plan being used then the people in the retirement homes have risk of getting covid. You understand what I am saying? And as said before what is happening to old people is horrible but this plan will not make their lives any better. Covid really did change the world. but can confirm that the lives of youth are fine with everything that is going on.  </p>
<p>in the USA 130 thousand people could be saved from dying by february 21 if people wore their masks <a href="https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.healthing.ca/diseases-and-conditions/coronavirus/if-everyone-wore-a-mask-130000-lives-would-be-saved-in-the-u-s/amp">source</a> </p>
<p>we just need to not rush the covid vaccine. have the medical experts make sure there is a vaccine . that vaccine would give immunity to EVERYONE </p>
<p>And also I think you may be over reacting with this heart monitor thing.. I know people that have medical that wear them but I doubt it would be mandatory to wear them</p>

        <p>Those US deaths are deaths WITH covid.</p>
<p>What does a death with covid mean?
Does it mean they were tested two months ago and died of a car crash?
Does it mean they got stabbed, were swabbed and had covid?
How many actually died from an illness directly related to covid?</p>
<p>The incentive to this is money. </p>
<p>This information is NOT published, and to my knowledge and there is only a single source for all of this information who don't disclose how they actually produce the information.. it isn't like you can compare to other sources.</p>
<p>We can go on forever. Either way.... time will tell and regardless of who is right we can both agree that that the truth will prevail.  If the mainstream is correct and the bulk of people are wearing masks / distancing / reducing contact than all I can hope is the long term collateral deaths don't exceed the 70something year olds that are being 'saved' while prolonging the virus. </p>
<p>If the skeptics are correct I hope the truth comes out and this craziness ends right now.</p>
<p>Either way skeptics with real information will keep authorities on their toes if anything fishy is going on. </p>
<p>Agree to disagree.. either way I hope we can move on with this sooner than later!</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
