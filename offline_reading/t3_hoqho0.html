    <strong>r/movies is pretty much the epitome of COVID hysteria and panic</strong>
    <p><p>For example, go to this thread:</p>
<p>https://old.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/ho6lum/coronavirus_wipes_out_98_of_location_shoots_in_la/</p>
<p>Is there a particular reason why this sub in particular seems to be so panicked? Like, these people are legit deathly terrified of this goddamn thing; I've seen more users there claim that they never want to leave home until a vaccine than anywhere else on the internet (many of these people haven't left their houses since March)</p>
<p>Granted, these types would gladly just sit inside watching movies all goddamn day instead of doing something productive either way</p></p>

        <p>There are a lot of subs like this. They're shut ins whose lives aren't changed by this and want people to live like them. In the real world, no one with a social life cared about this after a few weeks, maybe 2 months tops. Here on the upper east side, people drink in the streets every weekend with no masks and no social distancing.</p>

        <p>I agree half the subs on reddit are a bunch of whimpy shut ins who didn’t have a real social life before Covid and they want everyone else to be as miserable as they are. </p>
<p>Lots of schizoid personality types on here. Lockdown is like a dream for these people.</p>

        <p>...It's not just /r/movies...</p>
<p>I follow lots of entertainment and "nerd" subs, all of them are basically like this whenever COVID comes up. </p>
<p>I feel like people in this sub, and the sister ones, underestimate just how terrified people are right now. People are willing to give up their rights, and also their hobbies and passions, because they don't want to die of this virus. Whenever there's a cancellation of an event like a convention or a movie or anything, people seem perfectly fine with it. No more (x TV show) due to COVID? "Yeah, that's fine! I don't want this to spread anymore!" Even though, maybe a year ago, any sort of delay or cancellation of anything would bring out tons of angry fans.</p>

        <p>Well it's the r/movies crowd at least: nerdy types who never aspire to do much in life besides be a nerd. The film journalists on Twitter are the exact same way: wealthy white people living in upper-class LA who only care about Disney, Marvel, and Star Wars and never want to go to the gym, see the world, get a relationship, etc</p>

        <p>Its the online communities.  People i talk to in real life have more nuanced stances.  They parrot some of the same talking points, but you can see their actions and they are willing to take on some risk to continue living.  I work out with an ER doc who doesn't wear a mask for example.</p>
<p>I can't prove this, but I do highly suspect there is some type of bot/ai network that is more advanced and pervasive than we realize that knows how to shape the narrative, then the organic human users behave as pack followers and continue the narrative.  Perhaps I shouldn't say bot/ai network as i'm not advanced enough to classify it,  but my pattern recognition observes an unnatural shift.</p>

        <p>People around here keep making these claims. "It's only online!", "Everywhere is packed and fully open!", "No masks anywhere, even in states it's mandated", etc...</p>
<p>I don't see this at all. People, yes, in real life, are frightened. </p>
<p>For instance, I went to Friendly's the other day, which is a chain restaurant in the northeast. My spouse and I were the only customers there. I asked the waitress about how things were since re-opening. She told me that the restaurant was usually like this, mostly deserted, while people were mostly doing delivery or carry out instead. She told me the few who did come into the restaurant tended to wear masks and gloves, and tried to eat while wearing masks which she commended my spouse and I for removing ours because "it's more normal". She also told me they usually had 4 or 5 servers each night, but now it was just 1 because traffic was so low. Last thing she told me was "I'm hoping things pick up eventually, but people still seem pretty scared".</p>
<p>It's just been like this all over. Lots of masks, people still jump away in fear of others, malls have few people in them (not deserted, but still less people than the norm), etc. I think people are just afraid.</p>

        <p>This is what the media has done, create a mass hysteria and that's why I feel so hopeless sometimes. They have ingrained this bullshit so deeply into the psyche of the masses that how will anything ever be normal again? The public literally has to be re-programmed to forget this shit and move on to the next media craze. Maybe if Trump wins in November, media will realize they failed to get rid of him again with their latest ploy, so they will move on to something else that they think will destroy Trump.</p>

        <p>I'm not trying to suggest its only online, just that the online communities are a special type of insanity that behave very oddly, and are one of the main driving forces creating the fear that we see in real life.  Conversations vs observing how people behave while passing by also can illuminate the more nuanced takes that lurk beneath the 6ft/mask actions.</p>

        <p>I really think this is happening and might have started with the whole 2016 election crazyness. We have no idea how their AI technology has grown over the last decade or two and it could very well be shaping the insane ideas that are becoming the mainstream's worldview at this point....Like a small snowball at the top of the mountain they get things rolling artifically and let human stupidity and primal emotions take the wheel after.</p>

        <p>It makes me seriously wonder how much they cared about their "hobbies" or "passions" to begin with. Someone who is truly passionate about something won't enthusiastically drop it as soon as it becomes less socially desirable.</p>

        <p>Local subs are insanely bad. Mine actually banned me for verbally opposing the masks when people were trying to virtue signal...so if that type of censorship is going on in other subs (which im certain it is at this point) then you have a big chunk of the people who would be balancing out the narrative silenced and removed from the discussion...The level of groupthink has become so intense its nauseating.</p>

        <p>It's a default sub, you end up having a large overlap between the default subs and the Coronavirus doomer sub.  Any of those large/default subs will be like that.  Someone mentioned that many "nerd" subs are like that; TBH, the main gaming sub and gaming-related subs have been relatively light on the doomerism, and there were even quite a few comments on one post about someone enjoying the increased game time from lockdowns, by people who were tired of them.  So it's not ALL Fallout-level dystopia in gamer land.</p>
