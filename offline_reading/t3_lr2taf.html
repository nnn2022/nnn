    <strong>I haven't been in a store or restaurant since June, 2020</strong>
    <p><p>That's when the NC mask mandate was imposed.  </p>
<p>I won't wear a mask.  </p>
<p>There's quite a bit of rage bottled up inside me about the government's pandemic response, the farcical "election" and the behavior of my fellow citizens, which I believe have been brainwashed into a mass psychosis by the MSM and peer pressure.</p>
<p>I know myself.  If I went into a store without a mask and was confronted about it, I would probably lash out.  More so if it was a fellow shopper, and not an employee, because who knows, maybe the employee has to comply and/or say something to keep their job.  I choose to avoid the possible confrontation by using curbside pickup for just about everything.  The only kind of establishment in NC that doesn't have curbside pickup is the state-controlled ABC liquor store.  I avoid that by ordering from Caskers online.</p>
<p>This may seem defeatist to you confrontational folks here on NNN, but I am trying to avoid a verbal altercation from escalating into a physical one.  While part of me would relish that, I try to think of the other person, and how they may actually believe they mean well.  I am a sole breadwinner and can't afford to be arrested, so I also think of my family.  </p>
<p>By opting out of shopping in the store, I also believe it costs the business more to serve me.  They need to have an additional crew of people to take the stuff out to my car.  I know that will raise prices for everyone in the long term, but in the short term I am hoping it cuts into their profits, and just maybe they will start to lobby politicians to end the mask mandates.  I make sure to tell each person that delivers to my car to tell their management to advocate ending the masks.</p>
<p>I tried to eat at a restaurant in Wilmington, NC in Sep 2020.  There was outdoor patio seating.  Everyone was dining without a mask.  I walked up to the host stand with my family and asked for a table, without masks on, staying 6 feet away.  There was an open table 10 feet away, with no need to enter the building.  There were two other tables 10 feet away, with people eating, drinking, and talking without masks.</p>
<p>The host refused to seat us.   I tried to reason with the guy, asking how it could be logical or safer for us to have to don a mask to walk the 10 feet outdoors, when we were already outdoors, but he was having none of it.  He also had that contemptuous and petty tyrannical tone of so many mask Karens.  </p>
<p>That restaurant lost business that night.  I get how his boss probably gave strict directives about complying with Comrade Cooper's mandates, but in some part of his brain, or that of his boss, do they not realize that the longer this goes on, the more likely it is their business will fail?  I haven't tried to go to a restaurant since.</p>
<p>I'm just venting here.  One more personal perspective on how to deal with this societal breakdown.  I know my stance may seem stupid to some, but it's my way to try to maintain my personal dignity and liberty, while not submitting to illogical, arbitrary, and tyrannical control.</p></p>

        <p>I feel this. It’s tough to be confrontational without losing your cool, that takes actual skill. I’ve worn a mask in stores but I can’t wait to take it off, and i’m kinda envisioning how that would play out. Personally I think I’m gonna wait til cases drop a little more - ideal time would be first week of April when our mask mandates first hit. 1 year is way more than enough. If someone asks I think I’ll say something as simple as “I don’t have a mask”. I have half a mind to hit them with something comical like “I have a religious exemption” but that’s not my style. If they press me on it I’ll tell them to get a vaccine if they’re worried</p>
<p>When cases drop off, “I’m just following orders” is no longer a valid excuse. I don’t care if it’s their manager’s policy, or the larger company’s policy. At some point it falls incumbent upon all of us to take a stand, even if there’s a little risk there of getting in trouble. It’s not a stupid stance - your right to leave your face uncovered is a basic element of humanity</p>

        <p>Thanks.  I read today that Fauci says that we will all be wearing masks until the end of 2022!  How can the normies wrap their minds around that?  2 or 3 years is not a "Public Health Emergency"!</p>
<p>There are signs of this wearing down even the most fervent mask advocates.  I'm starting to hear and see women complaining about how it messes up their makeup, and how attractive women especially don't appreciate the decreased attention.  Politics is downstream of culture.  The beautiful people all earned their maximum virtue-signaling points from this already--the ones with the masks and preferred pronouns in their social media profiles.  Maybe they will seize on another cause du jour and that will be the prompt for the rest of society to move on.  </p>
<p>I agree that at some point, everyone has to take a stand, but I also know that the masks have been a boon to many who suffer from a lack of confidence, who are socially awkward, or are just plain not attractive.  They love the anonymity of the masks and have publicly stated they will wear them forever.  </p>
<p>Even after the mandates end, they will wear masks, and we will need to exert peer pressure to stop this behavior.  While it it their right to wear one, just as it is my right not to, we need to return to when the only valid reason to wear one in public is if you are sick.</p>
<p>I've thought about this extensively.  Some things we can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Repeatedly say. "I can't hear you, can you please remove your mask."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shun eye contact and avoid any social pleasantries for anyone wearing a mask (unless you are visiting them in a hospital or other valid settings)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give disapproving cues like head shakes and glares</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tipping less, unless the establishment mandates them as a condition of employment, in which case leave bad reviews</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many more examples.  The goal is to return to the old normal, where thinking, rational people knew that most of us out in public have innate and adaptive immune systems far more powerful than masks.  Those with weakened immune systems can take precautions. </p>
<p>We have to flip the script, and make mask-wearing abnormal again.</p>

        <p>I really can't hear mumble-mouths, so I just say "speak up" &amp; "I can't hear you" until they get uncomfortable. Obviously, no pleasantries, that's how the 'Rona gets ya!</p>
<p>Tips? For bad service? I don't think so! Maybe when I can be greeted with a (visible) smile. Then again, in Oregon, I can't eat 'in', so I can only get take out or eat in a cold, wet tent. I end up just eating in my van.</p>

        <p>I admire your resolve, but the way I know the mega-stores are losing nothing by curbside pick-up is they still offer it. Trust me, they are not losing a penny to do that. Likely just dumping things that were not selling in-store. </p>
<p>I know a couple Doomers that do that, because they fear if they even speak to a human IRL, that's how 'Rona gets ya!</p>

        <p>Exactly.</p>
<p>There is nothing to be gained by being a coward. I think about the places I shouldn't go in, daily, and have to sack up and do it anyway.</p>
<p>If you don't at least attempt it, then it means nothing. Nobody likes confrontation (I'm a really chill guy in public, I hate confrontation, any unneeded attention my way in general). These times require boundaries to be set, and that means pushing them.</p>

        <p>Fair point.  I don't think they created curbside pickup for people like me.  They were created for those so fearful they wouldn't go into the store.  But I do think they come at additional cost, and WRT dumping...I am getting the exact same merchandise.</p>

        <p>No, you are the people they created it for- doesn't want to go in store. They don't care if the reason beyond that is irritation of Dictator's orders or fear of 'Rona.</p>

        <p>I'm considering creating a list of the exemptions for wearing a mask in various jurisdictions, if people would appreciate that. A lot of rape survivors and autistic people and the like might have an issue with you using their condition to get out of wearing a mask, but I'm the one you've got and you've got my permission.</p>

        <p>We, family, drove through Charlotte back in October and stopped at a few places inside and outside the city limits (nothing down town tho).  Got BBQ at Johnny Rogers in Concord w/ my son.  Manager asked me to wear a mask out of respect.  I just kept asking if she wanted my business or not.  Ultimately  she let me in.  Bonus, there were two police cars parked out front and I sat behind them when I went it.</p>
<p>Point being you just have to poke the bear a bit but be prepared to leave with good manners.</p>
<p>Double bonus.  A lady riding in her Escalade stopped me on my way out and asked for 10$ for her son's football.  You never let me down Charlotte (was a past resident BTW).</p>
