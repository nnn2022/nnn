        <p>They'll likely be fine too. Find a Dr that will prescribe the right treatment and they'll pull through it.</p>
<p>Too many people have been sent home without HCQ+Zinc, or ivermectin, or budesonide (steroid) nebulizers.</p>
<p>They just got sent home to wait until ventilators were hooked up to kill them.</p>
<p>Pound vitamin D, Zinc and live your life. My 'rents are the same age. Both still working, one as a nurse with lupus. They're fine.</p>

        <p>Unless you're morbidly obese or immunocompromised, you have nothing to worry about. COVID-19 has a 99.5%+ survival rate in developed countries for everyone under 70 years. You're not even guaranteed to get sick, so the odds are in your favor, big time.</p>
<p>Please understand that you have been <em>made</em> to fear this by the MSM and the establishment. It's understandable that you would be afraid if you listen to them. That's what they want.</p>

        <p>You think watching movies in theaters or drinking in excess at bars and nightclubs is better than seeking professional treatment for mental problems? That is literally the extent of the "reopening" industries. Why not tell those people to get treated instead of lying and saying masking and distancing don't work and it won't kill them despite you not being a doctor or having ever met the people you are trying to influence?</p>

        <p>In a normal society, no, that would not be a good bandaid for serious mental health problems that need professional treatment. But when mental health decline is brought on by government imposed social isolation, then yeah, maybe you need a few nights on the town more than you need a shrink to tell you how to cope with having your freedom taken away.</p>

        <p>I'm not speaking about one individual person. I'm talking about all of us. I went into this in perfect mental health. My life has literally never been better on a personal level and I'm still finding myself slipping into mental disrepair because of it all. Not because of the mask. Not because of the lock downs specifically. If it was consistent and justified, I would be bummed, but not loosing my shit over it. It's the inconsistencies, the blatant lies that came out as being lies, being told to do one thing while the same people do another, having these things forced on us when they don't make sense on their face and everyone doing it anyway. My work is being investigated because 3 of us (one is my mom and one is a friend) working in a 2000 sq ft open air shop don't wear masks while the 200 sq ft coffee stand in our parking lot with 2 windows mostly covered by plexi glass is fine to cram 5 employees in as long as they're wearing masks. Do you really think that's more safe than 3 people that are related or close in relationship in a large area with free flowing air not wearing masks? Because that's what the government thinks and we might just loose our livelihood over it. I can go to the grocery store and get stuck in the liquor aisle because there's 15 people standing around waiting to get a bottle of booze, but everyone is masked, so its not a problem to anyone. Every one of their breath that escapes out the sides of their masks is now stuck to my face and I can't blow it away. I don't see what's so much worse about us working together breathing fresh air vs. Going to a bar and only wearing a mask when I'm not sitting at a table 2 ft away from the same fucking people. Nothing makes sense and not subscribing to the assanign parameters can literally cost you You're ability to live. THATS fucking depressing.</p>

<p>Hey look, a strawman!!</p>
<p>Literally from the CDC website after a cursory Google search:</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>What are the implications for public health practice?</strong></p>
<p>&rt;The public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic should increase intervention and prevention efforts to address associated mental health conditions. <strong>Community-level efforts, including health communication strategies, should prioritize young adults, racial/ethnic minorities, essential workers, and unpaid adult caregivers.</strong></p>

<p>Like your brain cannot compute that the Federal agency is instead urging local NGOs and local governments to tackle the problem? If your area is failing that is on your local area and maybe they should ask Sleepy Joe for help</p>

        <p>Are y'all held hostage in your rooms? Get outside. Roadtrip. Camp. Wth. </p>
<p>I don't buy the mental illness BS. Doom is right. People who CHOOSE not to adapt (while still being about to do things besides "sit around") likely already had underlying mental health issues. It's liberating because they just get to vocalize them now without a stigma. Also, they love having someone to blame for them (COVID). In reality, people like the OP have serious work to do, need professional help. Which they probably won't ever do.</p>

        <p>I'm going by what I know of this user. Who posts everywhere on mental health forums and covid support ('leftist') forums.  They have a job. They are almost 40. They live at home with their parents. They have a girlfriend (feel sorry for her), they constantly seek obesity help and end up fighting with others that offer insight on how to drastically change their life. They spend 5+ hours a day playing video games after returning home from work. </p>
<p>I'd wager when returning to "normal," this user will still be a profoundly dissatisified, unfulfilled, attention-seeking sad sap.</p>

        <p>So how your personalized opinion about the person reflects on reality of how others are surviving this? You're being extremely insensitive and ignorant and you realize this. 
What's OP doing or how his life is, isnt really anything you can be a judge of nor can you diminish pain and mental health suffer of others calling them weak. You have no right to tell someone their feelings are invalid. If you're doing good, great, I'm happy for you, but don't you dare to belittle others mental health problems.</p>
