    <strong>Will something big happen this July??</strong>
    <p><p>So, for this month (especially today, July 9th), we've got:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A cyber pandemic simulation on July 9th (today) by the World Economic Forum, known as Cyber Polygon (cyberpolygon.com)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As we got closer to 9th July, there were plenty of sudden convenient cyber attacks that ramped up, especially during the end of June/Start of July, so the last few weeks. Some examples over here: https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/oek8xz/here_we_go_folks_cyber_polygon_the_next_crisis_is/</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a CPAC being hosted July 9 to 11 in Dallas, Texas. Trump and other GOP players are headed here today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>President Biden has decided to utilize the "door-to-door" vaccination plan this month, to reach his 70% vaccination goal that he failed to reach on July 4th, when he only got 67%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos to space by nine days. Bezos will fly on his company's New Shepard rocket on <strong>July 20.</strong> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have felt as though something is in the works since this covid debacle started. I've always been skeptical, no vaccine for me. I have always had a gut feeling that something else is the agenda here, especially since the elites are now openly breaking their own rules (think, the G7 summit, matt hancock in the UK, certain USA governors, even when there are still rules for vaccinated people) Makes you think, makes you wonder. Why are they now <strong>much more sloppy when containing their hypocrisy?</strong> Why are certain billionaires set to go into space right after the 18th (which was said to be a possible date for project bluebeam). Do they know something?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regarding the "cyber pandemic simulation", if we're following the pattern of Event 201, which was another pandemic simulation, then that would mean that the real Crisis would come in either September or October 2021, since event 201 was october 2019 then covid was december 2019.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation hosted Event 201.</em> So these are the same people now hosting Cyber Polygon "simulation" as well.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Feels like July is going to be the most eventful month so far, but even this could all be a distraction for something worse.</p></p>

        <p>They’re more sloppy because they can be. This past year has proven the brainwashing worked surprisingly well. 
The masses are happily drinking and even begging for the koolaid; why work hard when you don’t have to?</p>
<p>But yes something big is going to happen:  <br>
We don’t realize it atm but the Beta variant is is making the rounds. We don’t realize it because, it is a super mild variant that presents like minor hay fever. It’s also the most contagious variant. It spreads super rapidly and nobody even knows it because it is never severe, let alone deadly.  <br>
Because of the very mild symptoms (if any) fewer and fewer people are getting tested. And the coolest thing about Beta variant, is that once you’ve had it, it provides immunity for all the covid variants, giving the world population undeniable (even by TPTB) herd immunity by Halloween 2021. </p>
<p>This is the big thing that is going to happen, if we fiercely manifest it !!</p>

        <p>More deadly version of the virus will be released to encourage or out more pressure to governments pushing for a mandatory vaccination program.</p>

<p>A Disaster Is Coming is a good video to start with for an overview. I don’t know how likely this scenario is, as I learned of it pretty recently &amp; need to do a bunch of research to understand it properly, but I think it may well be legit. It would explain a lot of the elites’ behaviour.</p>
