<p>If you look his name up on biased Google, his name gets trashed. If you look him up on something such as Duckduckgo, you'll find much more accurate information on him. People should STOP using Google as a way to get their Covid information in my honest opinion.</p>

        <p>Fuck Big Bro Google. Funny thing though, type “companies with the largest criminal history” into Google. (Before they fix those search results) It’s all our ~~vaccine~~ injectable biological platform producers! But trust them! Put your life into their experimenting hands!</p>
<p>Edit; that’s a great video. What a world that you get banned for sharing a video from a doctor who’s treated hundreds of thousands of patients. If only he touted the party line he’d be acceptable to listen to. But nooooo he has to go and tell the truth.</p>

        <p>Some guy made a post asking if it was safe for him and his friend to share a joint because he's afraid of getting Covid. I decided to share the link so I did. I went to sleep and woke up to that message of me being banned and thought that was pretty dumb of them to do. If you watch the video, it literally is a qualified doctor explaining a bunch of facts such as how having sufficient amounts of vitamin d (which we as humans all carry a great deal of in our bodies) can reduce risks of Covid and other diseases as well. He has a lot of great information and unlike a lot of other crap going around lately, he makes complete sense.</p>

        <p>I got banned from r/discworld for saying 'f33k trump' memes were inappropriate for the sub-which they were. A lot of people on Reddit can't take slightest criticism or even listen to anyone they don't 100% agree with.</p>

        <p>I got banned for quoting FDR!!</p>
<p>I grew up a stoner.  Politics weren't a big thing we talked about in our community, but we agreed strongly on two things: 1) End the wars and 2) Big corporate pharma is evil.</p>
<p>We would preach to anyone we met about natural plants and avoiding the toxic chemicals they want to sell you.  "No, brother.  Don't let them give you that Prozac.  If you're feeling too stressed to deal with it all, let's smoke a joint and chill." </p>
<p>"You have compulsive negative thoughts you can't get out of your head?  Let's do some shrooms and talk about it.  You'll probably find the root cause of your anxiety, or at least you'll be able to zoom out some and see the big picture."</p>
<p>Has the stoner community changed to become part of the system since it's legal in so many places?  Or are the mods just corporate shills / controlled opposition?  </p>
<p>How can telling someone afraid to have a friend over to smoke a joint that "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself" such a vile and evil thing to say that it warrants permanent banishment?</p>
