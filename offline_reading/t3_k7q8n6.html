    <strong>Remember back when it was Republicans who wanted to control everything about your life?</strong>
    <p><p>The anti-fun, anti-choice Puritans in America used to be on the right. They wanted to ban violent video games and gangster rap, force you to pray in school, stop you from having premarital sex, and put you in jail for life if you forgot to pay a parking ticket. All of this was under the assumption that they knew best how you should live your life.</p>
<p>Now the tables have turned, and to the extreme. Left-wing authoritarians have made it so that you can't even walk outside without their permission. No restaurants, no bars, no gyms, no playgrounds, no schools. You will stay inside forever and you will like it, because Democrats know what is best for you and it is their anointed duty to micro-manage every facet of your existence.</p></p>

<p>I remember being a leftist about ten years or more ago.  Not a liberal, I'm still a liberal, but an MSNBC indoctrinated flipping idiot.  I was horrified about McCain/Palin. Horrified.  Tried to turn my conservative friends to vote for Obama. Oh my god, the repubs would bring about a theocracy and basically turn my life into Handmaid's Tale.  I was all over the Huffington Post mindlessly parroting whatever Maddow or O'Donnell said, thinking I was so damned smart.</p>
<p>God.  I was an idiot.  Then I got rid of cable, started thinking for myself, and it turns out that the people who want to control me are the leftists who call themselves liberals or progressives but are some of the worst authoritarian, anti-liberal pieces of crap I've ever seen in my life. I voted for Trump.  Twice.  I'd do it again in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>I might still be an idiot, but at least it's my own damned brain making me one, not MSNBC programming.</p>

        <p>This is exactly my story too. Except I didn't figure it out til 2020.</p>
<p>I didn't care about politics at all until Trump and then I just mindlessly jumped on the anti-Trump wagon and immediately started to believe the narrative without thought or investigation. </p>
<p>I thought Nancy Pelosi was Superwoman. I will be apologizing for that on my deathbed, lol.</p>

        <p>Oh, so you hated Trump mindlessly?  If you were watching the MSM, I can't blame you but rather blame them.  I have never seen them so relentlessly attack a president.  </p>

        <p>I totally hated Trump mindlessly! It's freaky as hell now to watch other people continue to hate him mindlessly.</p>
<p>There is a great YT channel--Fleccas Talks--where he goes out on the street and to events and interviews leftists on various issues. It is extremely funny and eye-opening.</p>
<p>I'm SO embarrassed about the Pelosi thing. SO SO cringey.</p>

<p>I'll check out the yt.  And I would cringe Pelosi too, although I wasn't much better.  I basically thought Maddow was a goddess, and probably would have given unsavory favors to Obama.</p>

        <p>I also hated Trump - as someone living in another country, all I really knew about him was that he sexually harassed some women. This is how media distorts politics, changing the focus from ideas/policy to personality. If you asked me about Trump back then, I wouldn't have been able to tell you a single thing about his political party, only that he "grabbed a woman by the <strong>*</strong>".</p>

        <p>Seeing the left for what they really are instead of being under their thrall.  I'm still a liberal, a real one, and I really don't like many Republicans either.  I think the major factor was quitting cable and MSM news, though.  It really opened my eyes.</p>
<p>I'm not joking about the HuffPo.  I was an MSNBC parroting fool there, thinking I was smart and right, and the conservatives there were fascists.  After being deprogrammed, I came to realize that true liberalism and true conservatism have much in common.  The Democrats and the Republicans really don't represent either.</p>

        <p>Yes I agree. The parties have really shifted do you listen to podcasts or follow people like Dave Rubin and Eric Weinstein? It’s true that the MSM is just totally biased, and it’s actually scary how much they control what people think.</p>

If our country was in such top shape that abortions were really the main focus wow we would've been great. Then I saw it was a fear tactic because nothing ever happened and they didn't hang gays in the streets either. Once I started talking to more conservatives I saw they just wanted everyone to live in peace and you do you. I became a libertarian over 10 years ago and starting with this administration now a republican.</p>

        <p>Gun control, abortion, and gay marriage are some of the most privileged first world problems we could have. Yet the furthest left of us want to kick us back to a third world regime and think that'll do a favor for their cause.</p>

        <p>Absolutely privileged. I guess this country is perfectly run if we're creating issues like gay marriage and gun control. How about we let people do what they see fit? By the second amendment I'm allowed to have guns (especially for cases like what's happening now) abortion and gay marriage doesn't affect me so do your thing and leave me alone. It should be like that across the board. Higher taxes affect me. Lockdowns and masks and our rights being eroded affect me.</p>

        <p>Well, some repubs have taken away abortion rights I think.  That's so wrong.  But you're right, if that's the main focus we're screwed.  I lean libertarian too more closely to anything else, but I'm Republican because I want to vote in primaries, mainly.  I can't support taking away a woman's right to choose at all.  Why the hell to politicians think they can make these choices for us?  Abortion, mandatory vaccines if it comes to that, all of this.  We're not damned children, let us make our own decisions.  I actually have a curfew now.  10pm.  I didn't have a curfew like that when I was an actual child.  This is all becoming so ridiculous, the overreach.  I just can't stomach it.</p>

The bill passed the Lower House on April 30 (74-3),[16] the Senate on May 14,[17] and was signed into law by Governor Kay Ivey on May 16.</p>

        <p>Exactly. Many anti-choice state governments are now basically trying to criminalize abortion again, and they just might succeed. Of course politically this will be a "be careful what you wish for" scenario, but still the threat to women from these people is very real.</p>

        <p>And the left is 10x more crazy and insane than the right was then. This is coming from a politically neutral person. The left is closer to Hitler/Stalin whereas the right always felt like your strict dad. Annoying but wasn't interfering that much in your life that it caused problems, and always told you he trusted you even if he doesn't agree with your decisions. The left is just a dictator. No other words for it. The sides may have "switched" but at least we could live our lives normally under the right.</p>

        <p>It's the authoritarian and libertarian axis on the political spectrum that really matters to me, and many "left" leaning parties around the world sit nearer the authoritarian part than liberal part, most right wing parts are close there too but less so. </p>
<p>This may be an inherent flaw in western political systems, as we have allowed governments to have more control over our lives over time.<br>
It needs to be dialed back a bit, I'm not super libertarian as I recognize government does serve some good purposes especially around prevention of poverty, monopolies and restrictions on exploitation, but they should not have the power to mandate who can and can't go into your own home (as an example).</p>

        <p>At this point I feel like maintaining a truly libertarian society would actually require stronger antitrust laws than we have now.  TPTB are old masters at crushing or absorbing smaller competitors while leaving just enough "big players" around in a given market to avoid meeting the technical definition of a monopoly.  The customer has a choice... between four national-chain grocery stores that all have some form of "mask required" sign, and one local chain that got cowed into it after many months.</p>

        <p>The right really overdid it with the War on Drugs though. They fucked up a lot of lives in a very bad way, arguably far worse than what the left is doing. They imprisoned people for years for holding or growing a plant. They still do.</p>
<p>Covid is the left's War on Drugs moment. I still feel like they haven't taken it as far as they wish to, and if they do, we'll see insanity that puts the right to shame.</p>

        <p>As bad as war on drugs is, and this is coming from me as a veteran who knows guys who work for those agencies, that is NOTHING compared to what the left is doing now. Not even in the same ballpark. The war on drugs didn't effect the average American at all, whereas what the left is doing is absolutely tyrannical to every American. They are light years away in terms of how much freedom was taken away. </p>
<p>You couldn't smoke a joint under Reagan but other than that feel free enjoy life, liberty, and the fruits of America. The left? Threatening to arrest you and your family for having Thanksgiving or Christmas. Shutting down businesses and destroying lives. Causing suicides, drug overdoses to be at all time highs as people see their futures destroyed. Not even remotely comparable whose worse here.</p>

        <p>I remember when the Republicans were the crazy party. The bible thumpers, not allowing individual freedom, the small government but big corporations, the anti-science pro-religion. The patriot act. I remember when Fox News was the crazy propaganda network pandering to stupid people who didn't do their own research. </p>
<p>Fast forward 10 years.</p>
<p>Now information via the internet has become widespread. People can research things and see the religious faith based stuff is illogical and facts and science are best. The right loses its stranglehold on media (radio &amp; tv) as it is replaces with independent platforms (internet).  Society moves left. </p>
<p>Fast forward 10 years.</p>
<p>Corporations realize they can control this new media platform too. Just like how analog tv used to be broadcasted by anyone with the know-how and an antennae but got blocked out by digitization, this new "open source internet" could be be filtered by indexing, information controlled by censorship, and propaganda spread by anyone rich or powerful enough to do so. They just have to be stealthy and smart about it so the population doesn't notice it happening. The internet has "channels" now, even if you can't see them. ESPECIALLY that you can't see them.</p>
<p>Those who control the information flow desire a certain society. Identity politics and social justice take over all of politics. As one prominent religious party dissipates, the new religion of the Democrats replaces it. The new one is not backed by science but if you control the internet you "create" the science. If you disagree or point this out you are censored or called a nazi. Economy, jobs, anti-war, free market, affordable healthcare, affordable housing, these aren't the primary interest of politics anymore, if you bring them up like Bernie you are silenced. If you talk about them like Yang you look like an outcast. If you expose the corruptions and how the system controls all these things like Trump you are called Hitler.</p>
<p>Now we have a virus that even significant democrat politicians won't obey orders for, which telling you you must must do. Don't look at the statistics or the facts, just accept what we tell you and if you question it you are the problem. Support our lockdowns as we destroy society even more and continue this man-made depression that will make 2008 look like child's play. We will take away all your wealth, your jobs, make you reliant on the government, and force you to accept these new laws of this new society because you have no other option if you want safety/food/housing. We are re-writing all the rules for the game and forcing you to comply. Oh yeah we are massively taking away your gun rights too, effectively removing your about to resist it, whilst we all know increased gun laws don't take the guns away from the criminals but only from law abiding citizens.</p>
<p>This really is a "great reset" , a "new normal", or something close to it. I really can't tell exactly what is happening, but I can tell society is being funneled towards something. This pandemic provided perfect cover for it. The George Floyd incident and aftermath provided perfect distraction for it. We know BLM has nothing to do with actually helping black people, but has tons of underlying agendas the population would never accept so they have to disguise them. We know BLM and the democrat party are peas in a pod.</p>
<p>There is some huge underlying agenda here and there are powerful forces driving it. They DO NOT want you to know the truth, so they have put all these disguises over it to sell it to you as something different.</p>
<p>What do we even do about this? I have should have bought more guns and ammo a year ago. Late to that party. I should live close to the Mexican/Canada border just in case should shit get real fucked up I can go somewhere else temporarily. Honestly the government/media is forcing this shit on society, and sadly we are accepting it, because we don't have an alternative and people can't spend the time to put all these puzzle pieces together.</p>

        <p>Oh, it wasn't one-sided, even back then: recall that it wasn't the Republicans who forced the ESRB on us and wrote the proto-patriot act (<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/104th-congress/senate-bill/390">https://www.congress.gov/bill/104th-congress/senate-bill/390</a> - take a look at who wrote it, and, given that the justification was that was in response to the Oklahoma city bombing, the date).

        <p>It's always been this way, Democrats are very good at projecting onto others.</p>
<p>It was Tipper Gore who went after music...a Democrat. It was/is Democrats that want to control your healthcare, retirement, choice of schools etc, although they do allow for abortion on demand.  It was Democrats that created the kkk, filibustered the voting rights and civil rights acts in the 60s.  It was Democrats that passed NAFTA. </p>
<p>Make no mistake about what I am saying here: both parties are in the same club, but most of the "control" has been led by Democrats. </p>

        <p>But Reddit and the media won't call out Democrats when they do wrong.</p>
<p>Newsweek just publishers list of lockdown hypocrites and they only mentioned the political party of one of them, the Republican.  And to make matters worse, they had a picture where Newsom was on the right and someone else on the left, so they out Governor Newsom (R), to make it look like he's a Republican.</p>

        <p>Yeah. It's weird as fuck. When I was younger, exactly what you laid out was going on with the right and their flavor of moral superiority. Then it definitely faded away. And now the liberals act like they have some kind of monopoly on morality and it's even more insane than what conservatives were doing before because; when the conservatives did it, it was mostly the hardcore Christians which isnt most conservatives and the liberal's flavor is far more authoritarian and invasive in the individual's life. Neither was or is right, but what we see now from liberals is unbelievable.</p>

<p>He says these should be discussed because he’s a right leaning centrist but he’s not an idiot and that’s what his base want to hear. Trump literally said “take the guns first”.</p>
