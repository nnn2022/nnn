        <p>Shortage of toilet paper? Haha. All they had to do was leave it in the warehouses or trailers for a few days before unloading it in the stores. Then mad panic. Then they unload it and put it on the shelves a little while later. Pretty spooky stuff!! I think it might be too late for people already! The mentality of the general public has changed forever through this. Like the Linkin Park song ‚Äúthe Great Divide‚Äù we are there.</p>

        <p>Don't be stupid. The stores weren't holding back their restocking to induce demand. The media created mass panic and people literally wiped out the shelves faster than they could be restocked. It's very hard for a store to recover from that. You can order extra from your supplier for the next delivery, but when every store does that, the supplier doesn't have enough, so now all the stores get an even smaller delivery than usual. We live in a world of just-in-time supply chains, which is very efficient under normal circumstances, but cannot easily respond to a panic like what happened last year.</p>

        <p>So. What your saying is that I am right!! The media created a panic. People then started panic buying which in turn ran the stores out of supplies. If the stores and store suppliers had been warned first, this would not have happened!!  They could have just as well held supplies back. Same effect. Plan demic</p>

        <p>How would you "warn" businesses about a panic? Why do you keep talking about "holding supplies back"? That's not how modern supply chains work. Don't get me wrong, I'm here in this sub for the same reason you are, but the plandemic was planned by elites, not by grocery stores.</p>

        <p>Has nothing to do with supply chain. This is misinformation leading to chaos. Misinformation that people take as facts. Was there ever a shortage of toilet paper in the supply chain. No. Was there fake panic and fear put into peoples heads? Yes. This whole discussion we have just had is related the fear created by the plandemic. Bottom line! I know we are both seeing this from very different perspectives. But that‚Äôs ok. It was a good little debate. Cheers</p>

        <p>I literally worked as part of the supply chain we're talking about. I know exactly how it works, from first hand experience, so I don't appreciate you calling what I'm saying "misinformation". Yeah, we have different perspectives, in that you don't actually know what you're talking about, and I don't think you really understand what I'm saying, to be honest. Yes, there was a shortage of toilet paper in the supply chain. If the stores need X amount of toilet paper for a normal week of business, then the distributors have X amount ready to go out on trucks for the next week, and the factories have the materials onhand to have X amount produced by the end of the week to be shipped out, and the wood pulp industry has that amount of wood pulp ready by the end of the week to be delivered to the factories, and the logging companies have that amount of lumber by the end of the week to be delivered to the wood pulp factories. This whole thing is called a "just-in-time" supply chain. The industry collectively predicts how much of a product needs to be produced at a given time for market demand, and makes almost exactly that amount. They don't have extra materials or finished product lying around, because that wastes storage area, which wastes money. 99% of the time, a finished product that you grabbed off a store shelf rolled off a production line just a few days ago. If you were to understand this, then you would understand that if suddenly, everyone hears on the dumbass news broadcast that spooky virus is killing people in the streets and everyone needs to shelter in their homes for the rest of their lives, and people run out to the store to stock up on supplies, this creates a surge in demand that the supply chain was not prepared for, and as I said earlier, it essentially made a feedback loop where stores had empty shelves everyday, so they were ordered much higher volumes for restocking from distributors, so the distributors were running out and not able to fulfill the stores' orders 100%. So the stores' shelves would only get filled 25-50% the next day, which made people continue to panic buy out the shelves again. So the distributors had the same problem as the stores: getting wiped out every day and unable to get their orders 100% fulfilled from the factories. The factories then have the same problem, and then the resource producers have the same problem. As you remember it took several weeks for the store shelves to start looking like normal. That's because it took a few weeks for the shortage to reach all the way to the resource producers, who tried their best to ramp up production and cascade that surge all the way back to the store shelves. You also have to remember that while every link of the supply chain was trying to figure out how to recover from this, governments were imposing lockdown and health regulations and workers were dipping out for unemployment benefits or simply because of the hyped-up fear. The mandates and worker shortages made it that much more difficult for the supply chain to quickly and easily get consumer products back into well-stocked stores. My bottom line is that there was a shortage, of a lot of things, not because there was some kind of problem with the supply chain, but because people kept fucking buying out everything the supply chain could get made the very second it was on a shelf. And if the average person cannot casually purchase consumer products in the quantity they are used to, then that is a shortage, by definition. Thanks.</p>

        <p>Think for just 5 minutes please. If you were running a factory that makes toilet paper, would you also buy a warehouse to store it in, or would you just load it onto trucks as soon as possible? In general, very few of these businesses are sitting on a warehouse full of product. That's a waste of money, and businesses tend to avoid wasting money.</p>

        <p>Factories don‚Äôt store products. You know that. Distribution companies store and distribute the products. (Massive storage facilities) You should know that! Retail sells the products. When retail runs low, this is when the distribution can make some extra money. Fear and panic is very very expensive. Bottom line is, companies make huge profit off this!

        <p>JiT means that most businesses run out of product in 3-7 days.  There absolutely was shortages, but not how most people understand.  Distribution has changed a lot in the last 40 years, to the point that companies now consider tractor trailers to be "mobile warehouses."</p>

        <p>Actually I was making a sort of joke about your fear of your friends thinking you were weird. They DO make ones that play music and some have aromatherapy scents, heated seats, heated water, dryer fans...
The vibrating bidet was my poor attempt at humor... Sorry.</p>
<p>I've been lucky in all my apartments that the toilet was right next to the bathtub with overhead shower. I would swithch  out the stationary shower head with a detachable handheld shower head that just rested in a bracket.
I could grab it and use it over the toilet for cleansing. Water temperature always perfect. I kept a separate hand towel hanging on a towel bar for butt use only for drying afterwards. Waaaay cheaper than buying a special toilet seat needing plumbing to install. </p>
<p>The house that I bought has the bathtub too far away to do this. I'm looking to find a faucet attachment to a sink. I actually saw this arrangement at a hotel in Poland that I stayed at once  that didn't have a dedicated bidet. 
I've googled for handheld sink sprayers but have found nothing that would suit my purposes.</p>
<p>Water cleansing is the way to go for proper hygiene.</p>

<p>I work in a wealthy, 1% area too where none of us live in the area and are only there to work then fuck off back to lower-income areas. A lot of us were already used to struggling, so we didn't have meltdowns when food/TP were scarce </p>

        <p>My family never ran out of toilet paper, but I did have to set my alarm once to get to Target before they opened. People stood in a line outside. When they opened, everyone went straight to the toilet paper aisle. An employee was making sure nobody took more than one package. I was able to get one, but I don't remember whether it was my first choice brand. I did have to buy other brands a few times during the toilet paper period of lockdown.</p>
