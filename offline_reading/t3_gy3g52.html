    <strong>What really went into the decision to force a global lockdown ?</strong>
    <p><p>Why did almost every country on this planet just obliterate their economy and forced people to stop working and socializing ? Advanced economies can print there way out without damaging their currency due to  high demand, but developing economies just killed themselves and may never recover cause of this, I don't fully get it...</p>
<p>Now even after the world found out it had the same mortality rate as influenza and countless doctors coming out saying it's really an overblown situation, we are being told globally the masks and social  distancing are permanent. Here in BC we have 167 deaths since January, median age 85 and we had an average of 174 flights a week from China before lockdowns. Our exposure to China is probably the biggest in the world per capita outside of Asia, and there's literally no effect from covid here... None</p></p>

        <p>Can't speak for all of the world but in the US I feel if this was not an election year we wouldn't have reacted as we have. But the government was willing to tank the economy and do all it could in an attempt to tank the election for trump.</p>

        <p>I'm a democrat and it didn't take me long to realize that it's all the Democratic parties shitty power move. They want white people to think lockdown is just a minor inconvenience while minorities and low income families suffer so they can stay in power and scare people who look like me into voting for them I swear I might not be a Democrat after this it's disgusting talk about not doing what you preach. I hate Trump but the ends really don't justify the means</p>

        <p>This is exactly why.  And it's also why the BLM protests were needed right now.   They're acting like AA anger is something new that can't wait until after "Grandma" is more protected.    </p>
<p>And anger from AA should really be directed first at Democrats.  Most of the cities involved have had Democratic control forever.  In Washington state, Democratic mayors controlled Seattle for 50 years, Democratic state governors since 1985.</p>

        <p>Gvmts and leaders thought it was going to be really really bad. They knew their health care systems could NOT handle what they THOUGHT was coming (and what they thought was coming was based on hasty bad science and data). So they scrambled and shut everything down. Without adequate ways to deal with SO many cases they had no other choice but to try and slow the spread and buy time so that they COULD deal with the virus once life resumed. They also believed that overexaggerting to the public was the only way to get people to comply. And then the media got their filthy greedy little hands on it and the fear blew up to the point of no return.
And then when it hit, it never even came CLOSE to what they thought would happen. But now the lockdowns are in place and the public is beyond spooked. They've made a huge mess that was partly out of fear but also by instilling terror in the public to get us to comply.
 What a horrible mess.
And they'll never admit it.
And the very worst of all is that now (at least for me and my peers) being against lockdownn or even questioning it,  is seen as being pro trump and selfish. And even if the world goes back to normal and the virus dies out, that fact will remain. THAT damage is done.</p>

        <p>I think your wrong... This whole thing was pre-planned (the global lockdowns). Incompetence of this size isn't stupidity, it's an agenda.</p>
<p>I see a lot of media and online bots trying to shift the narrative to, the government and their officials are really incompetent, and they blame some retarded models some guy typed in C++... If that's the case of incompetence, why do we have permanent masks and social distancing required ? Why is there a " new normal " if it's just incompetence ?</p>
<p>Surely, like they admit now, were wrong. So why continue down the path ? Why are mandatory vaccines on the way, when it was a mistake like they say ? Influenza kills way more, and governments across the world never enacted forced vaccinations for influenza, so why now with covid ? </p>
<p>Propaganda networks (Main Stream Media) have been furiously talking about cashless society's now, cause paper money carries viruses all of sudden and it should be abolished. China started taking paper money out of circulation and putting them back as bank deposits, in the name of covid cause cash is dangerous now apparently.</p>
<p>You think everything happening with our rights and the constant hammering of the " new normal " is a coincidence ?</p>

        <p>I think they prepared this response for something way worse ... but when it turned out to be a weak flu-like virus they carried on with their agenda anyway.  The agenda was to destabilize Western democracies, and they were waiting for an excuse.</p>

        <p>Crazy because in all my friends and family Circle and all my social media I don't know anybody who had the virus or even know somebody who knows somebody who ever had it. With that said, I'm not subscribing to any conspiracy theories. I find them too vague. I really do think it's just incompetent and monkey see monkey do. To me, the fact that I don't know anybody at all who's been affected by this just shows a little of a worry it should have been all along</p>

        <p>Never let a good crisis go to waste. I think it was partially planned, but in real life things happen a certain way whether you like it or not. The issue is I don't know how to separate the two in this case. It is highly suspect that they've had both sides hating on the police, one for arresting them for enjoying their Constitutional freedoms (what a joke in the end) and the other for police brutality (protester hypocrisy much?). Was the goal to make everyone hate the police? well it's not working.</p>

        <p>I actually do think some level of lockdown was warranted early on, when it was first implemented. What we were seeing in Wuhan, where the gov't had to build ten hospitals in the span of a week, was terrifying, especially since there was (and is) good reason to believe China cooked the books on their numbers. And then in Italy there weren't enough ventilators and the government had to implement death panels to decide who got to use them. The original justification was to buy time while hospitals acquired ventilators, hired extra staff, built up capacity, etc. But once that was achieved (and it was achieved pretty quickly, NYC got close to capacity but never hit it, and quickly recovered from there), they had already gotten addicted to power. Combine that with the politics of fear in this country (USA, not sure what it's like in other countries) and their "not one death"/"you're killing grandma" mantras; the hyperpartisan Democrats who suddenly became extremely pro-lockdown as soon as Trump started making noises about scaling them back; and the fact that certain groups with lots of political power (mainly Silicon Valley) stood to massively profit from the circumstances; and now here we are.</p>

        <p>It was to help control the situation, and buy time to augment supplies, learn more about the virus and treatments.  But at some point it has to end, and I think these protests have ended it.  I even wonder if they have created a constitutional issue in states that have had the protests. I hope people sue.</p>

        <p>It’s basically because all the early data was terrible. First from China then from Italy. I know some doctors who were legitimately afraid of dying from this thing. That is something I have never witnessed. They have all since gone back to normal life more or less.</p>

        <p>Yes China had that report showing that 18.5% of <em>all</em> cases would require hospitalisation. That is extremely scary. And then Italy's incompetence meant that everybody thought that every liberal democracy which didn't do a full on China-lockdown were going to inevitably deal with triage and overwhelmed hospitals.</p>

        <p>I think for five reasons one was because it was a real threat for a while and overfluding hospitals two was because we were in panic and pressuring law enforcement to do something in the name of panic. Four was because of wishful thinking with law enforcement thinking we would have a treatment by now and five because our news media is corrupt.</p>

        <p>It was a confluence of unfortunate events:
1. Lockdown in Wuhan
2. Northern Italy caught by surprise
3. Neil Ferguson report
4. Trump</p>
