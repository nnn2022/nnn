        <p>I mean literally if the lockdowns had been -- or even now were -- properly enforced and effectively maintained for a couple of weeks this could all just fucking end. But people would rather scrape the bandaid off slowly with a dull, rusty, infected razor than rip it all off at once and be done with it. So here we are. </p>
<p>This is what happens when people who think that ignoring and running from problems is an option for dealing with them are allowed to have this much influence on society. Instead of a few weeks of properly-implemented lockdowns and other measures, we're going to end up with years of scattershot half measures <em>and</em> millions of dead.</p>

        <p>Wanting the lockdowns to end faster is being a "Doomer" and "wanting government control over my life". Wow. That is some bananas backwards-ass shit. </p>
<p>Choosing to behave in a way that requires more and more government clampdowns and longer and longer dragging this situation out is in fact the choice that is asking for more government control. If people just did what they were supposed to, we wouldn't need governments to force us to do it. Murderers are the reason there are laws against murder -- not people who never murder. People who have made all the wrong decisions this year <em>are the reason</em> people are losing more and more of their freedoms and livelihood. We wouldn't need lockdowns enforced by law and punishment if people were just voluntarily doing the right thing, and we wouldn't need them to go on for very long if people would just do the right thing for long enough for the virus to die off. It doesn't survive that long without being passed along as a new infection in a new person.</p>
<p>If this is how you react to people wanting to take simple commonsense steps to end the crisis, you're part of the reason it's lasting this long and requiring more and more drastic action, and part of the reason kids are having their childhoods ruined by months (and probably years) of this shit instead of it just being handled and them being able to go back to living normal lives.</p>

        <p>That’s some serious mental gymnastics right there. </p>
<p>You are really taking the stance that if everyone locked down this would all be over? You’re wrong. There is no evidence that lock downs work, lockdowns are the worst possible solution to this virus with a 99% survival rate.</p>
<p>You act like your fellow countrymen and women are the problem when this virus came from China not your fellow citizens. Your solutions are to impose strict government control over everyone and everything to “stop the virus” and more than half the country thinks your solution is dogshit. That should open your eyes but it wont because the MSM just reinforces your narrative and you feel good thinking you’re right and we are all ruining everything for everyone else. You are an easily manipulated fool begging for more strict government control under the assumption that it’ll just be “temporary.” </p>
<p>We’re on month 8 or 9? Of 2 weeks to flatten the curve... and you think if we let them have even more control, they’ll just give that up after the virus goes away? </p>
<p>The virus isn’t going away, the great reset is the agenda they’re pushing. Move to a different country if you think The US is failing at stopping the virus, China would love to have you and control you. You’ll love it and fit right in.</p>

        <p>Please stop using the 99% number. If it actually was that, the virus would be huge and deadly.</p>

        <p>Hypothermia has a 0.005 percent chance of happening to you. According to your logic, since hypothermia has a stupidly low chance of happening to you, why wear coats? Hypothermia mainly kills children and older people, so who cares? Screw coats, they're propaganda and don't work since hypothermia only has a 0.005 percent chance of happening. Tell the government to stop coddling us by selling us coats, down with coats! Same with stomach flu's. Since I have a really low chance of dying, why lay in bed? Why eat pepto bismal? I only have a small chance of dying, who cares about it! Look. I don't think you get that people actually suffer. Just because you're not a person who didn't die or suffer from Covid-19, doesn't mean you are the only one on this planet who exists. The world doesn't revolve around you. People suffer from this. Severe respratory diseases, immense coughing and hacking, and death. So stop and think about it for a second. You're not the only person alive. People suffer. So don't say that masks and lockdowns don't work. You're just being a self-absorbed bitch.l</p>

        <p>Alright. But would you not wear a coat in below subzero tempuratures, you stupid fucking dumbass? Would you? No. You wouldn't. That's because you'd get super fucking cold. And catch hypothermia, you fucking dumbass. Now see. You're in a crowded store. You're not wearing a mask. You are surrounded by people not wearing masks. Several of these people have covid.

        <p>&rt;I mean literally if the lockdowns had been -- or even now were -- properly enforced and effectively maintained for a couple of weeks this could all just fucking end. But people would rather scrape the bandaid off slowly with a dull, rusty, infected razor than rip it all off at once and be done with it. So here we are.</p>
<p>It's truly amazing that after all the data we have gathered there are still people who actually believe this.</p>

No, as you said even you don't agree with lockdowns, qnd that's good. But masks aren't efective either, a piece of paper or cloth won't protrect you against this.</p>

        <p>We should probably shutdown the entire world for this. It's a highly contagious disease that no one takes seriously. Even if this was a more deadly disease, this literally shows people can't handle the easiest of situations. And, btw. Masks do work. They slow the coronavirus by a really high amount, and keep your germs circulating around you, and not infecting other people.</p>

        <p><em>"keep your germs circulating around you"</em></p>
<p>So the germ build up on the mask just stays obediently near you and isn't transferred onto other surfaces even after the person is completely saturated with their own germs? That's like saying you won't get anything else wet after becoming completely submerged in water, lol! Makes total sense!</p>
<p>Also it should speak volumes that this highly contagious virus is something the majority of people don't take seriously because they are not seeing people dying the way the media portrays it.</p>

        <p>Actually I've seen the exact opposite. Since wearing masks in public is a relatively new thing, I see 90% of people fiddling with it while wearing it, something that goes against <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html">CDC recommendations</a> :</p>
<p>How to Wear</p>
<p>Wear a mask <strong>correctly</strong> and <strong>consistently</strong> to help keep from getting or spreading the virus.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be sure to wash your hands before putting on a mask</li>
<li>Do <strong>NOT</strong> touch the mask when wearing it </li>
</ul>
<p>You and I know the majority of people do not follow these recommendations like health practitioners do. The public hangs their mask on the rearview mirror of the car which is NOT a sterile environment plus the sun weakens the material making it even more useless. If it is a medical mask it should be discarded immediately after 1 use. These are the majority I see hanging in peoples car. </p>
<p>Then there are the people who are constantly adjusting it, big no no if you want it maximize it's effectiveness which in all honesty isn't much. People keeping the mask in their pockets or purse which is also filthy and completely defeats the purpose. You should probably do more thinking than insulting, i dunno just a thought......</p>

        <p>Idk. I'm used to seeing people with masks that aren't medical masks. Also, who hangs their mask on a rearview window? Tf. </p>
<p>&rt;You and I know the majority of people do not follow these recommendations like health practitioners do. </p>
<p>Sadly, yes. People are a bit... bad at following directions. </p>
<p>&rt;If it is a medical mask it should be discarded immediately after 1 use.</p>
<p>Definitely agree. Medical masks are good and all, but not reuseable. I don't understand those who reuse medical masks. </p>
<p>&rt;plus the sun weakens the material making it even more useless</p>
<p>I don't know many people who leave their masks out, in the sun. In fact, I know none. It could just be state/country difference. Also, it's not useless in the first place, so I don't know where you're going there.</p>
<p>You give good points. Sorry bout the cussing. Just get a bit heated in arguments, and he started cussing, and I started cussing. My bad.</p>

        <p>Here in Texas it is very common. I can walk out of my parking lot anytime of the day and see one hanging from someones rearview mirror. We have a 95% plus compliance rate here in my town. Cases still rising. </p>
<p>What gives? Two things: </p>
<p>1.)This is all bullshit and it doesn't matter what we do because of faulty testing (See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_Vy6fgaBPE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=260">PCR discussion</a> ) or 2.)the test ARE accurate but infection is common and NOT as lethal as portrayed.</p>

        <p>I think that's just a Texas thing. You guys have the highest rates in all of the USA. I think you should start taking this a little more seriously. I live in a more liberal place in California, so I guess I don't see that much stuff.</p>

<p>95% plus compliance rate would imply people take this somewhat seriously. I guess you missed that...</p>

There are people, friends, family, who are telling me this is dangerous. I don't watch politicians. I could care less about this country's politics. You, on the other hand, have extremely smallmedia outlets telling you this isn't real, it isn't dangerous. Technically, we're both thinking from media, and you're not thinking by yourself.

        <p>I never said this isn't a real virus, what I said this can't be used to  justify such authoritarian laws. I know people who got fired, one who went bankrupt bc of this, some people who are getting depression of staying at home all the day without other family members, without friends, and that's what you are truly supporting when you advocate for these laws against people and their freedom and rights. And all this bs started without we even know how effective this is, without serious scientific studies, only based in a failed mathematical model.

        <p>They are reports from CDC, and it doesn't say any specific area, so entire US. In the same article it also says about another problem that increased during the lockdown: fatal and nonfatal overdoses have increased during the pandemic by 20 percent compared to the same time period in 2019.</p>
<p>The other link I sent you is about a woman in Canada, not US tho. But if you search here on this sub, "mental health" or "suicide" you can find a lot of cases and more info about that.</p>

        <p>Here, I'm gonna pull a you. On you. Alright. So. Depression's been around for a while. A long time. Tons of suicide last year. Lot's of depression because of social media. It barely increased this year. So why all the fuss, huh? It doesn't matter for them. As long as I don't get affected. Also, depression pills, and therapy don't work. So why pay for them and have all the fuss, when it doesn't affect me. Do you see how this is flawed? This is your logic. Deaths have only increased a little bit, huh. So why wear masks?

        <p>Look at it this way. You're saying that this lockdown has caused a lot of depression. Now, see. This disease. It's caused a lot of deaths. Now hear me out. Shouldn't we be focused on ending this disease. So there will be less depression. And as a plus side, which you don't seem to care about. Less deaths.</p>

        <p>&rt;We should probably shutdown the entire world for this. It's a highly contagious disease that no one takes seriously.</p>
<p>Unbelievable lack of awareness.</p>
<p>&rt;And, btw. Masks do work. They slow the coronavirus by a really high amount, and keep your germs circulating around you, and not infecting other people.</p>

        <p>For what it’s worth, I was really not trying to be cute or play games. I can see that you’re feeling defensive and paranoid about my sincerity and that was the best I could do to communicate to you what I think are probably the three key points to communicate:</p>
<ol>
<li>That I sincerely do want to have a conversation with you and understand your interpretation, beliefs, and logic.</li>
<li>That I currently don’t see that what you posted proves my statement wrong that responses to the early (and even current) spread could have been a lot better and more uniform, and that if they were, it would have ended the situation much sooner. You posted stuff about masks not working and about infection rates and hospitalization rates, and it just doesn’t add up to any kind of proof that “there was no way to handle this more effectively or more quickly.” But maybe that isn’t the point you mean to argue, only if so I don’t know that because you aren’t explaining it.</li>
<li>That I really am open to having my mind changed on this. I am. I don’t expect it to be, and I doubt it will happen, and it would be momentarily embarrassing for me at this point if it was, but I’m totally fine with that and being wrong. Sincerely. I know it’s hard to really feel that through text in an Internet comment but I am.</li>
</ol>
<p>So I really would like to have a conversation about this and understand your logic. It’s a win/win for me, because there are only two outcomes, both of which are good:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I realize I’m wrong, which is momentarily uncomfortable for me but ultimately good because I’d rather have the right information. Maybe I’m missing something, or maybe I believe something that isn’t true, and finding out what it is is good for me, and good for anyone else who believes that the more people who understand the truth, the better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I figure out what it is you’re missing, or what it is you’re believing that isn’t true, which is also good because it helps me better understand exactly what it is that is keeping us all from seeing eye to eye on this situation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So you can believe me or not believe me that I’m open to listening to you, but I am. Respect. Other people have come straight at me with anger and hostility and tinfoil hat stuff here but you’re the only one to actually approach me with what at least kinda appears to be a sincere desire to share facts and talk, which is why I’m saying all this to you.</p>
<p>By the way, I wasn’t even talking about masks in my previous comment so I don’t know why you posted about them, but since you brought them up, here’s a controlled experiment from where I live about their effectiveness:</p>
<p>https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/10/22/national/science-health/japan-masks-block-coronavirus/</p>
<p>It’s late here and I was just going to bed anyway but I promise I’ll read whatever you send me when I get up, and if there’s a conversation to be had or things to be learned I will stay engaged.</p>

        <p>As someone who also thinks lockdowns are bad I wish the other people on my side would actually have a proper discussion with you instead of just saying “go read the data for yourself” or “do your own research” I hate when people do that if they’re trying to convince people of something</p>

        <p>Thank you. Please talk to me then. I mean look through this thread, and imagine it from my perspective. Prior to this thread I thought most people who didn’t want to follow the mainstream health and safety protocols were a little on the mistaken, misguided, stubborn, or paranoid side. After this thread I’ve come to feel that a great many of them are actually deranged and have completely untreated mental or emotional self-regulation disorders.</p>
<p>Which makes sense, I guess. There are deranged people with untreated mental issues in the world, and they’re also going to have political opinions and join groups and causes on the Internet. I guess I should have expected them to support the wrong stuff.</p>
<p>But I’m sure there are people like yourself who are sane and socially functional here too, and obviously this is not how you’d want to be perceived or have your ideas represented, I’d imagine.</p>
<p>I have to ask: don’t you feel kind of weird about <em>this</em> being the crowd of people who share your opinions? I mean look at the average response to me. Look at the kind of people they are. Doesn’t it give you pause that <em>they’re</em> the ones who believe the stuff? What are the sheer odds that <em>this</em> is the enlightened crowd who has figured out the real truth? What are the odds that <em>this</em> is how the real intellectually-superior, better-informed, more logical crowd would act?</p>

        <p>The problem is a lot of people, myself included, spend hours researching all of this. People who believe the narrative of the pandemic want a silver bullet that will switch their beliefs in an instant but that’s not how it works, so they say there isn’t any proof. Plus, there’s the chance that even if I were to spend hours laying out all my info, you wouldn’t believe it because you’ve solidly committed to the ideas you’ve been holding since the start of this. I have no way of knowing if you’re sincere in your quest for knowledge (even if you say it). So let’s start with this. This is a letter from a doctor to the BC health minister in which he lays out what is actually happening. But don’t just read the letter, check out the sources that he cites, because that’s the real research. He has just combined it into an easy to read, to the point message. If it peaks your interest and you would like to talk further I will gladly talk with you and share more. I want to believe the reason you’re on this sub is because like a lot of people you feel something is off and you’re looking for answers, you just don’t know where to go to find them. And if that’s the case we welcome you with open arms. </p>

        <p>And how exactly is that "anti maskers" fault when literally almost no government in the world paid everyone's wages/froze their bills in a way that they could afford to not go to work? </p>
<p>It is impossible to do a total lockdown without totally locking down, you people seem to forget that actually most of us DID initially lock down because no one knew the full story, but people couldn't afford to do it for long, if at all. You need to be blaming the governments. Everything comes back to them and the moronic way they dealt with the situation.</p>

        <p>Governments do absolutely share a big part of the blame, I don’t know what makes you think I’ve said otherwise. They should have acted faster to subsidize people’s livelihoods and well-being during the early lockdowns, giving people no excuse. And people themselves should have also followed better health and safety protocols more stringently. I’m not saying one group deserves all the blame, in saying there are several reasons things have gotten this bad and <em>all of them</em> should have been handled better.</p>

<p>Go to the fifth paragraph, where a professor bemoans that infections increased in London during the lockdown.  If the lockdowns don't work (even if that's in part because of people not adhering) then why continue to call for more?  You close restaurants, bars, schools, and most businesses, and it doesn't stop the spread.  If those restrictions don't reduce interaction between people enough, then they clearly aren't effective.</p>
<p>The next step is to weld people into their homes, and I'm sorry to tell you that that is not an acceptable option.  No one but authoritarians and those who are tolerant of authoritarianism would accept such a lockdown.</p>

        <p>From the article you linked:</p>
<p>&rt;The insider added that there was “concern across the system” about the number of Londoners out shopping and visiting restaurants on Saturday and Sunday, the first weekend since national lockdown measures were lifted.
&rt;Footage of densely crowded streets and crammed queues in the West End over the weekend showed hoards of shoppers ignoring, or unable to obey, social distancing measures.
&rt;The effect of this increase in contacts is likely to be felt in five to seven days’ time, health officials believe. </p>
<p>You literally tried to prove me wrong with something that pretty much repeats exactly what I’m saying. The lockdowns and health and safety protocols aren’t working because they aren’t being done right and people are not following them. It really is that simple.</p>

        <p>If your plan requires 100% compliance, it’s 100% going to fail. People in the US are physically and mentally weak. You really think they can fully lock down for any duration of time? This is beginning to sound like the communism argument: “it really does work, you just have to do it right!”</p>

        <p>Look at that quoted text a little more carefully. They were out shopping "the first weekend since national lockdown measures were lifted." So they were out shopping after the lockdown, meaning that those interactions did not contribute to the increase in cases during the lockdown.</p>

<p>It’s right there, plain as day: public contacts increase transmission. Lack of social distancing increases transmission. You’re missing the forest for the trees.</p>

        <p>Yes, likely to be felt in five to seven days after the increase in public interaction. But this happened after the lockdown was lifted.</p>
<p>It's also right there plain as day: Lockdowns with reduced public contacts increase transmission.</p>
<p>During the lockdown, the number of infections increased. If they increase either way, then what's the point of a lockdown?</p>

        <p>You yourself chose the article, so I assumed that you at least understand it. If you honestly have that question you should be asking the scientists who you are quoting and imagining back up your point, not some random person you just showed the article to. But here:</p>
<p>They don’t increase at the same <em>rate.</em> That’s like asking what the difference between looking for change on the street and running a company is. They both make money, right? </p>
<p>One thing you’re right about but drawing the wrong conclusions from: a poorly-implemented lockdown is indeed not very effective. That’s true. What that means is we need better measures, governments need to make better decisions, and people need to exercise more self control and common decency. What it does not mean is we should all just give up and say there’s nothing we can do but wait.</p>

        <p>The question is clearly rhetorical, because the lockdowns are supposed to, at this point, stop the spread. But, now I see that we're back to slow the spread, which is good news to me.
What is it that you think people are doing to screw up the lockdowns? The reason that businesses are closed is to socially engineer social distancing. But if people are not going to the restaurants and aren't going to the stores, yet the spread continues (and it's bad spread according to you and others), then it is the lockdowns that clearly don't work.</p>

        <p>Don't play dumb: you know the messaging went from "slow the spread so hospitals can get ready" to "stop the spread and destroy the virus like NZ (kind of...) did".

        <p>We DID do that at first. It didnt work because people still have to go buy food, people still had to stock shelves, people still had to deliver food from farms to the stores, and people still had to make the food. Its impossible to lock do to any effective level without just letting everyone starve to death first. That's what China did, they took blow torches and welded people's doors and windows closed and just let them starve.</p>

        <p>The "biohazard" in question is a 99.96% survivable virus that causes symptoms similar to the common cold (I had it). Even among the "vulnerable" population over 80 years of age, it's 95%+ survival rate doesn't pose much of a threat. Covid has a similar death rate in people over 80 as the general death rate for being over 80.  It's clear to many of us that the virus hysteria is going to be seen through the lens of hindsight and history as just that, hysterics. And knowing you were wrong, you will be claiming to have been on the other side. That was the point of the discussion.</p>
<p>Bullets can be extremely deadly to all of those who are shot, having been shot does not confer immunity to bullets. Most of us do not confront criminals with the consequences of crime and are at extremely low risk of shooting, it is not inevitable that we will be shot. It is inevitable that we'll all be faced with this virus and many others in our lifetime  Nobody is denying doctors a mask or refusing any PPE to those who want it, your analogy falls flat because is has no relationship to the issue being discussed. By your logic we should all be forced to wear bullet proof vests at all times and confined to our homes, perhaps we should install bullet proof walls and windows as well at the expense of others and force everybody else to install them as well and to stay inside the protective walls.</p>

        <p>I think your survival figures are a tad more than slightly optimistic, specifically for older people. Not to mention the number of Americans with additional conditions that complicate immune response.</p>
<p>Just had a family friend, age of 34, die in his sleep because of blood clots in his lungs from corona. Dude was obese and had sleep apnea, he went from relatively healthy to dead within a week. Please, go on telling me that people aren’t dying but I can link an obituary if you’d like. This is the 4th person that I personally know of dying from the virus. </p>
<p>Regardless of whether or not you want to acknowledge it, the virus is a threat. Maybe not to everyone but who are you to deny people the chance to continue living? Especially when all it may require is for you to wear a mask and not stand next to each other it’s a very small amount of effort and consideration for the possibility of keeping someone alive. Personally, I genuinely hope that it doesn’t effect you or anyone you know, but putting your head in the sand and denying that anything is happening (even if it’s overstated) isn’t a defense from it.</p>
<p>The whole idea that this is a conspiracy, that’s embraced worldwide by virtually every country is going to end up on r/agedlikemilk but perhaps you all will come to recognize that with time.</p>

        <p>But you're wrong. I have blood that is teeming with antibodies, I don't pose a threat to anybody. I'm a barrier to infection. There is no need for me to wear a mask or to stand away from others. The logic you're using is extremely flawed. If you're scared, stay home, wear a mask but don't force your phobia onto others. </p>
<p>You may think my numbers are optimistic but they're based on CDC data and they include all people even those with underlying health conditions. You should go find a data source you deem worthy of your belief and begin to truly understand what you're afraid of rather than focusing on unhealthy people you know. If my 45 year old, 460 lb, diabetic brother with sleep apnea wants to go out maskless and see a movie, he knows the risk, that's his choice. It beats the hell out of him carrying out his suicidal ideation caused by the hell you and your ilk support with mandatory lockdowns. My brother gets extremely ill with EVERY cold he's exposed to. It's still his choice and his healthcare decisions should be between him and his doctor. You should have nothing to do with his medical decisions.</p>

        <p>&rt;but you’re wrong</p>
<p>No, u </p>
<p>Antibodies? You’ve successfully recovered from covid-19? The thing about posing a threat is that we still don’t know if people who have recovered from the virus can still spread it. I’m not claiming to be 100% right, however I am willing to go through a handful of small inconveniences if it protects someone, even someone I don’t know, and that is the core of the issue. Yes, we have rights but others have those same rights and that GM your rights could effect the ability of another to exercise their rights it’s no longer a question of what your rights are. You have the right to freedom of speech, unless you are needlessly inciting violence or causing chaos (try screaming FIRE! in a movie theater in hen there isn’t a fire). You have the right to bear arms to defend yourself, use those weapons offensively and you no longer have that right.</p>
<p>Also cdc data suggest a ~10% or more mortality rate for people in the 65 and up groups. We still have a death rate of ~8% in the age 45-54 group. If you take the mean of those mortality rates from age 45+ you land at about 10.6%, roughly 1 in 10. Even in the 24-34 age range we’re sitting at a mortality rate of roughly 3%, how many people do you pass in a day, and do you like those odds? Anyone who buys lottery tickets knows they have significantly worse odds of making it big, but millions of people still play and believe that they will win at some point. The odds of getting infected and killed by corona virus is orders of magnitude better, regardless of your age.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">source</a> </p>
<p>So I’m not certain where you find CDC data that contradicts their own covid mortality statistics, but if you have them I’d love to see it.</p>
<p>Edit: statistical accuracy</p>
<p>Exit2: I’m reasoning with a troll. Account is 127 days old, with the first post happening roughly 40 days into account creation. This person (bot?) is literally here to naysay.</p>

        <p>Wow! You're just out of your mind with fear of this microbe and a desperate need to find meaning in it. You're not looking at the data, you're reading fear mongering articles that are outdated. As more cases have happened the mortality rate has gone down. People survive, become immune and we now know that asymptomatic spread is extremely unlikely. With a negative test and postive antibodies we can be extremely sure that people aren't spreading virus. You're the one who came to r/nonewnormal to troll. The fact that you think I'm a seminar poster tells me exactly who you are.</p>
<p>You crazed control freaks are all the same, you need desperately for me to wear a mask but you don't wash your hands. There's no mask mandate where I live &amp; I'm not wearing one. It's YOUR responsibly to keep yourself healthy not mine. If you're scared, stay home and go broke but don't expect other people to serve you, deliver to you and support you while you cower at home. And no, I'm not willing to give up any rights so that you can entertain a false sense of safety. All who would give liberty for security deserve neither and will lose both. You're going to get the virus just like everybody else or you can take your chances with the vaccine. When you discover that you were wrong, I hope you own up to it and don't claim to have been anti-lockdown or at least you feel really guilty about lying.</p>

<p>That "Just Leave" idea was exactly what Obama did in Libya and tried to do in Syria. And by leaving both places destabilized, they both look like Mad Max movies today - literally, with guys in Toyotas with WWII style anti aircraft guns bolted to the back cutting the place up into their fiefdoms. 10 years later, still a mad max world. Still a hotbed for terrorism and recruiting and getting weapons to terrorists...

        <p>I also was in favor of the war. But I was in favor of staying and controlling permanently, the way we did Japan. We'd build McDonald'ses and serve McRibs until Islam became deradicalized and the country started producing electronics.</p>

        <p>This is what being a fantastic parent is about. Not going with the crowd to make yourself look good, but doing what is right for your child even if it makes you unpopular.</p>
<p>You're the best sort of parent and never let it be said otherwise.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your kind words. I think this is exactly what I needed to hear. It does get hard sometimes when you have strangers and family alike questioning your parenting. At the end of the day, none of that matters if you know you are doing the right thing for your family.</p>

        <p>This is why the most radical of leftists believe that children rightfully belong to the state and not their parents.  They see the family as a protected environment beyond their influence where "reactionary ideology" is passed down from parent to child.  Therefore the way to destroy it and promote true equality is to have all children raised in state orphanages.</p>

        <p>I want to give you 1000 upvotes.</p>
<p>Where has sanity gone though? For every parent being reasonable there seem to be a bunch obsessed with safety and going above &amp; beyond to prevent their kids from having a sense of normality. </p>
<p>My partner's niece had a "zoom birthday party". SHE'S SIX. My cousin's son is 9 and an only child -- he used to play football and go over to friends' houses. Now my cousin has him playing xbox 24/7.</p>
<p>It's heartbreaking.</p>
<p>In Spain (where my extended family live) they actually made it <em>illegal</em> for children under 14 to leave the house for 8 weeks. There were viral videos showing distressed 4-year-olds throwing tantrums and telling their parents they "wanted to be a dog" in order to be allowed outdoors. My other cousin said the day children were finally allowed out (albeit only if accompanied, only for 1h, and only in a 1km radius), her 8-year-old daughter gushed that it was the happiest day of her life.</p>

        <p>I know. I think this was literal child abuse at the hands of the Spanish government. Completely unforgivable and there should be a public enquiry because they already had data from China and elsewhere showing that kids were not at risk.</p>
<p>And yeah, it was widely noted that dogs had more rights, because the government specifically said dogs could be taken out twice a day!</p>

<p>And masks aren't that useful for being in close contact with people for extended time anyway (even if you could magically make kids keep it on and not play with it). My bigger thought actually is if you have the same few kids that he sees a lot, vs cycling through a bunch.</p>

        <p>Truthfully I have been at my breaking point since probably April. I’m just not sure what I can actually do to make a difference at this point. As a 31 year old Mom, I’m probably not the person you’re looking for to start the revolution either.</p>

        <p>I don't really have that point. To me it's like going on a diet. You might have that day here or there where all you want is some ice cream, but then you're back on it the next day. It's more about finding the little things that make it more manageable without breaking the whole thing.</p>
<p>It helps a lot that mask wearing and social distancing barely register as an inconvenience to me. And things like conventions that I'd been looking forward to simply aren't options (and are so high risk I don't think I'd be able to convince myself to go anyway).</p>
<p>Reaching March and the full year milestone would be the next rough patch after Christmas. But now that we're seeing vaccine approvals and the light at the end of the tunnel, I'm definitely in it for the long haul.</p>

        <p>We've been seeing many indications that masks and social distancing will continue as if the vaccine didn't exist.  Fauci himself has said so.  No one <em>anywhere</em> is even talking about a "masks off date."  Will you be okay with it if, in 5 years, you and your kids are still wearing masks and living these disrupted lives?</p>

        <p>Depends on how disrupted and how well we adapt I guess. Masks and social distancing aren't a big issue for me as I said before; and that should only get easier and more natural with time. No social gatherings would be a hard sell as permanent policy, but I'm having a hard time imagining that after vaccine adoption. I'll need to look up where Fauci said that.</p>
<p>For now, just taking it one step at a time.</p>

        <p>So that Fauci statement was back in September and basically said that they would need to continue following the numbers even after a vaccine comes out. If the vaccine is highly effective and widely used then we'd be going back to true normal. If it's isn't fully effective or too many people pass it by, then restrictions would decrease but not as much as people hoped.</p>
<p>The good news is that vaccines being approved are showing to be highly effective. The bad news is that Fauci is expecting an adoption rate of about 80% where for reference the heard immunity point for measles is approximately 95%.</p>
<p>In that case I'm still willing to go along for a while. Even if I can't carry it effectively, businesses and such have no way of knowing who's who. But at some point if you have the opportunity to protect yourself and choose not to then I can't be expected to make up the difference for you. Not sure how long that'll be for me, but certainly before that 5 year hypothetical.</p>
<p>Probably irrelevant anyway due to the highly effective vaccines. The people in danger are those refusing a vaccine; who very largely would also choose to release restrictions even now and don't expect other people to be taking measures to protect them. The only mandated restriction I really see sticking at that point is international travel because that's not up to us. And a few places, particularly hospitals, may choose to keep protections for a long time yet.</p>

        <p>Not trying to pick a fight, I just want your opinion - as you said the people in danger of the virus are the ones refusing the vaccine. From my understanding this entire campaign of mask wearing, social distancing, lockdowns, vaccine push, all of it - is being sold as the majority of the population who is not in mortal danger of this virus protecting those that are.</p>
<p>Now if those people that we are all sacrificing our normalcy and in some cases livelihoods and wellbeings are the ones that are choosing not to be vaccinated because they would rather just move on and take the risk - then what are we doing?</p>

        <p>Don't worry about making me mad. Feel free to ask as many questions as you want, or explain how you disagree, whatever. Even if you start insulting me I don't mind, just might not stick around then. And let me know if I overstep myself. My opinion isn't popular here so I'm not exactly trying to make friends, but I don't want to be insulting either.</p>
<p>And sorry this turned into a wall of text. I tried keeping it brief, but I was basically just repeating my last comment.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Your bit about the current state being "the majority of the population who is not in mortal danger of this virus protecting those that are" isn't wrong but there's more to it than that. Death is the most significant risk and easy to track, but we're concerned about more than mortality. COVID-19 can really mess you up and not kill you. So people regardless of demographic have mixed motivations about protecting themselves, specific people they care about, and the general public. We rely on each other to keep things as safe as possible to increase what we can do as acceptable risk.</p>
<p>And I might be misreading what you were getting at in the second half. I wasn't trying to say that the people at risk now would later refuse the vaccine; I meant that after the vaccine has been made fully available for long enough that everyone that wants it can get it, then at that only at risk group remaining would be those that refused or can't take the vaccine. To get more specific I'm seeing three groups</p>
<p>1) Those that are medically fragile enough that they can't take a vaccine. I'm really concerned for them, but I'm not sure what can be done. We aren't going to get herd immunity without mandatory vaccinations, which is not a line I'm willing to cross. There aren't enough people here to merit everyone taking precautions at that point. I've thought about it a lot, but for now I just have to throw up my hands.</p>
<p>2) Those that are unconcerned about COVID-19 and thus see no reason to vaccinate. That would be the portion of this sub that skips the vaccine. And yeah, I don't feel much sympathy in a post-vaccine world for this group, nor do I think you would want my sympathy because to you there's nothing wrong.</p>
<p>3) People that are concerned about COVID-19, but are even more concerned about taking a vaccine. I go back and forth here a lot. I've generally landed on the decision that they can self manage, and the lower spread because a significant part of the population did vaccinate will help.</p>
<p>When all is said and done what I expect is that for people requirements will be replaced with recommendations, and businesses will have less obtrusive requirements like sanitation levels or HVAC air exchange rates. Although if the last few years have taught me anything it's that politics is not predictable, so don't assume what will happen and just handle it when it comes.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your opinion - I believe this is what this entire sub is all about. No prerequisite for particular beliefs, just using logic and critical thinking to come to an educated thought on an issue. And in my opinion (though yours may differ) using logic and critical thinking is what got most of us to congregate here in the first place!</p>

        <p>We did too. Just certain friends and thankfully my brothers live close so my boys got to see their cousins. My children's mental health is very important to me. You're a great mom. Keep shielding that sweet one from this insanity. I'm sure there are a lot more mom's and dad's that did the same but are too scared to say it.</p>

        <p>Thank you, I agree that the children’s mental health (and ours as well) is so important to take care of. It’s often overlooked or an afterthought but it is so important to your overall health. I’m happy to hear of another family doing this, at least not every kid is gonna be screwed up in 20 years. Hopefully there are many doing this in secret because I am scared for this new generation if not.</p>

        <p>I know a lot of people doing this (but my circle is mostly conservative Christians so we kind of all think alike, lol). Our kids aren't an afterthought. What happens to them in their early childhood actually affects how they will be as an adult. I don't think people really think about that or care about that and it's really sad!! I also will never mask my kiddos. Not gonna happen. Thankfully, no one has given me push back about this. Even in california!</p>

        <p>Agree completely. I’ve had my daughters friends parents say no to play dates because of this nonsense and it’s so upsetting. Her school has also said the kids aren’t allowed to trade Christmas cards this year. Again for some weird contamination reason which has no logic. It’s disgusting.</p>

        <p>My son's closet friend invited him to sleep over awhile back. I jumped at the opportunity. He's sleeping over another friend's house next weekend. We live in a strict state, but most people here are over it. </p>
<p>I used to take him somewhere fun every other weekend. And he loved going to the local indoor pool. We've done none of it going on a year now. I had even paid for us a vacation to an indoor water park back in February. He'd been asking for a couple years but it's like $250 per night. I finally had enough extra cash to make it happen and had to cancel. I'm so tired of this shit. I went way overboard for his Christmas because the year sucked so badly.</p>

        <p>As one of the "covidiots" you seem to be referring to, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I still have contact with a few select friends, we just avoid large groups and meeting with people we don't know too well. If we go out in public we wear a mask. It's fine for your son to not lock up inside the house, but something like going to school with tons of other kids is not as safe as a 1 on 1 playdate.</p>

        <p>The most shocking thing to me has been how quickly it has been swept under the rug after what felt like a decade of growing awareness and care with people taking mental health more and more seriously. Athletes coming out and saying they have anxiety disorders or depression and being praised for their bravery, shifting attitudes in using sick time/PTO with people advocating for taking "mental health days" off from work, puppy petting zoos on college campuses for student stress relief during finals week, etc. Some has been an over-correction, but overall it has been a healthy progression towards mental health awareness and encouraging people to take care of themselves and seek help if needed.</p>
<p>Fuck all that apparently. Your caring for your mental health could increase the risk of a 90 year old dying next week instead of next month by an immeasurably minuscule amount. Screw your mental health, lives are at stake. /s</p>

        <p>Omg where the f is this???? This is childabuse in my eyes honestly.</p>
<p>I live in the Netherlands and kids here still go to school. My daughter is 10 and still goes to school without a mask and they can still play together and sit together. Here the government told us that the spread amongst children is almost zero.
The playgrounds are still open, theme parks are open and most indoor play areas are open as well.
My daughter still plays outside as well and they come over to play in her room too.</p>
<p>This is the one and only childhood she gets. No way the government is gonna ruin that. If they were to close the schools I would just do fun activities with her all the time lije we did in march (schools were closed in march for a few weeks)</p>

        <p>If so, it won’t be the fault of the schools.  What we are finding out is how few parents have given a shit about actual parenting, and how the schools have been making up the difference the best they can.  Now is the time for parents to take responsibility, take an interest in their children’s education, social skills, and general mental well being.  They should have been doing that all
Along, but many haven’t.</p>

        <p>Very scary! My recollection of childhood will NEVER be their reality and the understanding they will have is ‘Why?’ Why did I sit next to someone, why did I share boogers, why did I play and spend the night over? So many things they will never know or have experienced, let alone ‘become blood brothers/ sisters’ and what that meant! Omg the reality of calling a friend and they were not home.... you just call back or ride you bike over is meaningless to today’s generation.</p>

        <p>Sure but it won’t be because they’re sitting in hula hoops it’ll be because of the ease of communication. Now I’m not saying technology is bad, because it isn’t it just <em>is</em>, what I’m saying is that with the ease of communication births “ghosting” culture, ghosting culture breeds a generation of young people who are afraid of face to face conflict and solving their social issues. </p>
<p>I know 30 year olds who can’t even communicate with their partner face to face but only via messaging when they’re mad. I’ve been ghosted in real life by people who can’t even face their conflicts. And tbh I’ve ghosted people too. </p>
<p>We will question why these kids will be antisocial and struggle with mental health and the answer will be because with technological communication online we take the human out of the equation that’s why people got huge Twitter fingers in the Facebook comments but pull up irl they’ll be all “omg hiiiii” to your face.</p>

        <p>They'll never say it's the lockdowns of course. </p>
<p>They're blame the 'baddies' for not wearing masks, social distancing, or people partying...never mind that they broke the same rules by this point most likely.</p>
<p>They'll say..If only OTHER ppl did what they were supposed to do, these kids won't have to suffer. It's always others' fault. Always. Never their own. Hypocrites.</p>

        <p>They were already saying kids social skills were drastically declining because of social media because text doesn't give you context clues and facial expressions. But at least they had SOME contact with people in person. Now they've taken that away too. It's gonna be scary when the youth grows up. Mental illness is going to be off the charts.</p>

        <p>So let me get this straight, You THINK kids will struggle to socialize because of this as if they aren't allowed to talk to one another. But we still recovered after a war. I don't think a pandemic is going to cause this seeing as boomers like you still love to run your mouth. U know this shit ain't even funny, it ain't child abuse, ITS SAVING LIVES. All y'all mfs can't even wrap ur head around wearing a mask vro. If y'all gonna complain about it happening, then wear a mask and stop it. Some of y'all dumb asf. This be half a mile deaths and y'all still ain't doin shit. learn ur mf fact vro</p>

<p>Note that I do wear a mask, as most of the people here do but difference is we don’t wear them 24/7.  We wear them only when we have to and take them off the moment it’s not necessarily.</p>

        <p>"A mask won't magically make things better." So slowing the spread of covid won't help. I don't think it will stop it, but we could make this the flu where ur quarantined if you have it so you won't spread it. The vaccine is in the works and is proven useful so if we could slow this down so it gets the chance to be a "flu season" type thing, then we wouldn't have to worry.</p>
<p>I don't expect 100 percent of people to do it either, it'd just be useful. But I see where you're coming from. And it's also good you where a mask when you're told, though I do suggest doing it when you feel is best as it allows you to be as safe as possible with the most comfort.</p>
<p>Edit: now noticing, this kinda came out as aggressive but I do argue with respect towards you as you bring valid points and questions up</p>

        <p>Haha it's funny because they make it seem like they care about mental health right now. And also, if you're so scared about the future, why not change the narrative, prepare yourself to help them cope with whatever they are developing now due to COVID restrictions? Oh no, I'll sit down and complain about how crappy things will be 🙄 bitches please if you're really into people's health of something tangible about it</p>

        <p>Posts like these are fear mongering to validate people's believes in here that restrictions aren't worth it.</p>
<p>Does anyone in here really believe COVID restrictions are going to last through two school years?  Does anyone here really believe that one school year's worth of restrictions is going to be that traumatic and damaging?</p>

        <p>Ooh yikes, we are currently locked down here again in Victoria, for a week (cost to business over that time = $1billion+), soon probably to be extended for longer, hopefully not but possibly for as long as last time (112 days), with mandated masks, 5km radius restrictions, closed businesses, many that were barely holding on from last lockdown finally closing/going bankrupt, cancelled weddings and other events, delayed medical treatments and elective surgeries, school missed for all students, etc., etc... over a current total of 63 active cases (1 in 100,000 of population have at most flu-like symptoms, probably asymptomatic), and not having had a single death since last November.</p>

        <p>Like I said, that was besides the point. I didn't spread it to anyone.</p>
<p>I am a healthy young guy, I know that it wasn't going to be as bad for me as it would be for someone else, like my elderly clients, so  I made sure to make my contact with others was minimal and I got tested.</p>
<p>My real problem is people fearing for their life, I understand others, but if they are young and in good health, they shouldn't be worried.</p>

        <p>Sure you can die from it, but you can die from tripping on the stairs. </p>
<p>In my age and health group, something like 20 people in the US have died from covid. I'm sure that numbers gone up since I read that, why would you stress about something that kills even 100 people like you, out of the thousands, a year?</p>

        <p>Catching the same thing multiple times is extremely rare from what I'm understanding, and a quick Google search said that if I come into contact with people now I and others should be fine. If you're willing to link something saying otherwise I'll probably believe it.</p>
<p>It really was just like a normal flu, I wouldn't worry about getting it again, but I understand the risk for others so I stayed home when I was contagious.</p>

        <p>I'd prefer for children to grow up with the consequences of social distancing (there aren't any) than to grow up parentless or not at all.</p>
<p>By all the downvotes, I can tell that you people truly don't care about the people/children that are dying.</p>

        <p>Preschool teacher here. There will be consequences for children growing up with this. Children rely on watching people’s facial features in learning how to speak, read social cues, and learn about emotions. Also children will have a hyper awareness of germs and illness and have an increased fear due to this. Also many children will probably have issues with personal space and touching others. But, I am 100% behind social distancing and mask wearing in school settings. Children are resilient and will bounce back, but there will be consequences.</p>

<p>This post is also implying that Covid will be here for 20 years, which is already a ridiculous claim. Had we handled this pandemic as well as New Zealand did, we could still go out as much as we like. But we didn't, because people are too self centered to even wear a face covering to prevent transmission.</p>

<p>And no it doesn't imply covid will be here for 20 years. It states, very clearly to those who can read, that treating children in this way will have consequences for their development that will be more manifest in 20 years time.</p>

        <p>&rt;Had we handled this pandemic as well as New Zealand did</p>
<p>LOL.  They didn't handle anything.  They just enforced some dystopian hate-policies towards their spineless citizens who just sat and ate it.  Pathetic.</p>
<p>&rt;But we didn't, because people are too self centered to even wear a face covering to prevent transmission.</p>
<p>Mask compliance has been very high in the US for a long time.  You NPCs just refuse to actually read anything not spewed by corporate media.</p>

        <p>Maybe if you silly bastards listened to the experts advice you could enjoy the things Australia, Nz and many other countries enjoy like stadium games and no lock downs and kids playing together without getting themselves or their family sick. But nah y'all dumb as shit so y'all will keep doing ignoring simple advice then go on and complain about how long you have to sit in lockdown. How fucking stupid are you?</p>

<p>It's because western European countries most closely resemble life in the USA, so when their curves match ours only a shallow thinker goes around blaming "Dumb twat" Americans.</p>
<p>In addition to a lack of understanding of simple numbers, doomers also seem to lack the ability to extrapolate a bit of straightforward information.</p>

        <p>You are hilarious in your acceptance of a knee jerk reaction to lockdown a city. Even for two days is bullshit. Accept it now and you’ll have to accept it in the future. That is not freedom. That is permission. And that comes from living under the weight of the crown. I would rather live free in my “shithole” country than live under that weight. The cities and states with lockdowns have wannabe monarchs issuing the decrees.</p>
