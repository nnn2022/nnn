    <strong>I’m just tired.</strong>
    <p><p>I can't handle not being able to talk and enjoy group activities anymore. I already had issues with depression and ADHD because of my PTSD, but with no sympathy from colleges and an unclear career future, I'm feeling worse than ever. I used to just cover it up for other people, and let it all out when I got home. But now I'm covering it up at home, and never letting it out, because I'm freaking trapped here. </p>
<p>What's worse is I know the lockdown is all BS and that masks don't actually do that much. But it's not like I can just drop everything and not comply with the stores I DoorDash to and the college I need to learn at to eventually get a job in my field. I can't afford to be suspended or refused or kicked out. </p>
<p>So I have nothing to do but follow the crowd with the knowledge that this is all for nothing. That my aunt died today because the morons at the hospital didn't know how to properly treat her and infected her heart with bacteria after introducing a central line, the same heart that had 2 surgeries last year and an artificial ventrical. All because my extended family wouldn't listen to our warnings. </p>
<p>My friends are too scared to hang out, and I can't make spontaneous friends anymore on public transit or even network like college and everyone else keeps warning me is necessary in my career. I can't visit my grandparents without quarantining first either. </p>
<p>But I can't do anything about any of it. No one will listen, nothing I say will make a difference to the larger crowd, and not related but my non-venomous snake escaped and I haven't found her and it's been 2 weeks and I'm afraid she got into the walls through holes on the main floor. I also can't ski because I have an injured toenail that's healing, so my one form of interaction during this time with others is gone now. I'm tired. </p>
<p>I don't want to work. I lost my first job at the start of this mess and the second bores me out of my mind. I don't want to do college. I don't want to meet people online only. I have no motivation knowing I might be stuck in this burning pit of despair for longer than I have had to so far. Nothing gets me excited anymore. What's the point of an extracurricular event if I can't freaking breathe while playing it or express what little emotion that shows on my face because it's covered with a mask. I'm just so tired of everything. I want to have fun again.</p></p>

        <p>Do you have any statistics from reliable sources to back up your claims? And also, do all of a sudden those at risk to covid 19 don't matter? We should just put those people aside because they are at risk. Its not just old people, obese people as well as those with diabetes. Do they now not matter because it fits your agenda? You people are heartless</p>

        <p>The bigger thing is that it's not nearly as deadly as they claim. They include deaths not directly or even slightly caused by Covid. And people with diabetes and old people die from the flu and other diseases too but those are never mentioned. I mean I mentioned my aunt died today. It wasn't from Covid, it was from a bacteria that entered her heart through a central line while they were attempting to treat Covid. And Would you rather offset those Covid deaths with the suicides from all walks of life and starvation cases from kids who can't go to school to get their only food for the day? Is it fair to kill them instead? And what about the people it will put out of business? Who might also starve because they can't make any money off of the only thing they had to their name? What about the increase of domestic violence cases that can also lead to homicide? I could continue. Not to mention, once all of us young and healthy people get it, there would be herd immunity. Why not just let us get it, have all the high risk people stay quarantined for that time, and then once all the healthy people are immune and can't get infected again release the lockdown? It'd take a few months max to infect and have everyone recover, so why not? And the vaccine isn't fixing it. People have started dying from it already. Healthy, young people. What about them? Covid hasn't killed healthy young people, but the vaccine has.</p>

        <p>Maybe hasn't killed any young people was a bit inaccurate, but very few deaths have been to young healthy people vs all the other deaths. Which a small percentage of the already tiny .2% or so is what you call in statistics an outlier. Yeah it happens, there will always be exceptions, but every young person, minus those few exceptions, survives. That's like saying after an earthquake that the engineer who built a certain building should be fired because one ceiling tile in one room of an apartment complex fell down and hit someone. When it comes to an illness the chances are never 0 when referring to deaths. </p>
<p>Life is packed with risks. Every time you go outside in a thunderstorm you risk getting struck by lightning. Every time you swim in a freshwater pond you risk getting infected by brain-eating ameoba or walk barefoot on grass or dirt you risk getting a parasite. Every time you drive your car you risk getting hit by a distracted or drunk driver. And every time you do anything you risk dying from unintentional injuries. I mean worldwide 2.3 million people who don't even have high blood pressure die from strokes a year. One day you could literally be minding your business and have a stroke and die. But that's a risk you take. </p>
<p>Reminds me of a book about a guy who was told he was going to die that day. He avoided going to work so he wouldn't accidentally fall onto the train tracks somehow or trip. Then he turned off the lights in his home because he didn't want to start a fire. Then he decided to sit in a corner waiting for the day to end because he didn't want to choke on any food or trip in the dark and hit his head on something. As the day ended he drove himself so crazy and worried from the ticking clock that he had a heart attack and died. We risk dying every day. But it's the likelyhood that each thing might cause our death that helps us decide if it is "safe enough" to do it. </p>
<p>I mean, around 400k people die a year from homicide. You are just as likely to die from murder as you are from Covid in the US right now. Add car accidents and a plethora of other death causes that might be out of your control, and it'd probably be more than twice as likely for you to die as a healthy and safe driver minding your own business and doing everything right than getting Covid.</p>

And let's not forget to deprive those elderly of contact with their family and friends, and when they do die from other causes well make sure that they are scared and alone.
