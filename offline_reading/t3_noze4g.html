        <p>I know I said I was done with this subreddit but I just couldn’t resist coming back and GOD DAMN did this article fill me with rage.</p>
<p>“Some people took to journaling...”</p>
<p>Yeah CNN, some people also shot themselves in the head or drank themselves to death. Fuck your “adaptability”... I hate when that word is used to describe bending over for the government.</p>
<p>Sorry, I had to. Fuck CNN.</p>

        <p>This article was enraging.... a classic example of lockdown narcissism. </p>
<p>There’s also something unsettling in her use of “we” throughout the article as if she’s trying to tell me how I should have felt.</p>
<p>This author couldn’t be more out-of-touch.</p>

        <p>I see they left out how people were manipulated and lied to byvthe media.  How this same media encouraged them to shame, ostracize, and descriminate against anyone who questioned the narrative.  How people were pressured, bribed, guilted and coerced into medical experimentation.</p>
<p>Yeah, none of that happened.  We were all peace, love and understanding.  And you can fertilize your garden with that BS.</p>

        <p>Ah, and so begins the romanticizing of the pandemic. The media and covidiots are going to start gaslighting everyone into remembering 2020 as the year the world came together and defeated the mean old virus. Movies will be made about people overcoming their differences for the good of their communities. Of extroverts forcing themselves to isolate to protect their neighbors, and learning something about themselves along the way.</p>
<p>Most people are fucking stupid and will completely fall for it.</p>
