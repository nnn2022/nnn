    <strong>I’m creating a thread specifically for listing the weird and unusual circumstances about the whole covid situation in general. Please comment your concerns and what made you start to question the narrative.</strong>
    <p><p>I’ll start. The censoring and de-platforming of anyone with a differing medical opinion, the suppression of other treatments which have since been proven to work, the focus on largely unhealthy preventative measures instead of encouraging healthy habits and activities that strengthen the immune system, obvious fear mongering, manipulation of data, guilt-tripping, the push for social isolation and the effort to sever social connections in the form of mask mandates, gathering limitations, etc., the FACT that the death toll is inflated, with the reported death toll STILL landing at &lt;1%, the multi-million (maybe billion?) dollar global propaganda campaign, bribery in the form of lotteries, free junk food (yet we’re told this is about our health), free weed, trucks, guns, hunting permits, etc., the implementation of a vaccine based social credit system and the erosion of basic rights and freedoms, the politicians who don’t follow their own mandates, the largest upward transfer of wealth in history resulting from small businesses being forced to close while monopolies continued to operate, the cult-like behavior and mass psychosis, and government-sponsored vax checkers who will be going door to door collecting information about vaccination status and adding people to lists based on their vaccination status, the behavior of guards at covid quarantine zones at national borders, the suppression of people speaking out about adverse effects and deaths related to the vaccine, the fact that the World Health Organization refused to acknowledge Taiwan as an independent nation, peculiar timing of the “outbreak” which just happened suppress an uprising against the Chinese Communist Party in Hong Kong, and the fact that research and development of the vaccines is heavily funded by a powerful billionaire who talks openly about reducing the population to 500,000,000 (same number mentioned on georgia guide stones), and even claims that his vaccines can reduce the population by 10-15%, the World Economic Forum calling covid a catalyst for the great reset (you will own nothing and be happy), Blackrock, Vanguard and others buying up absurd numbers of single family homes on an international scale while the media pushes articles about how America should be a nation of renters, the demonization of people automatically labeled “conspiracy theorists” for questioning the narrative while also being accused of spreading “dangerous misinformation,” and dissenters being classified as a danger to society.</p></p>

        <p>Apologies to people who read this last week when I made this post on a similar thread to this... I am reposting here again to answer your question because I took time to think back when writing this.... </p>
<p>I live in New York City and I work in healthcare so in the beginning I had no idea what this was and I was fearful initially. That was in March. I remember my last day at work in the office was March 12th. I went to a birthday party for a 90 year old on March 13th which was a Friday and I remember we were all sitting around eating and talking like normal and everyone was hugging one another and I had a feeling that that was probably going to be my last normal encounter with people for a long time. It was just a gut feeling I got.</p>
<p>I live alone so I had lots and lots of time to think. Nearly all of my social contact was cut off, I was forced to stop going out into the world and interacting with people. So I spent a lot of time taking in information from many different sources. I didn't limit myself to any one website or newspaper Etc. It started to smell fishy by mid-april to me. By the end of April I stopped wearing a mask outside. I was the only person doing this. So much of it didn't make sense to me at all, I have always had to take what they call a fit test for wearing masks when around patients so I know what you need to do to make masks actually effective. Nobody was doing any of that and whenever I mentioned it people acted like I was insane. It seemed like everything I knew to be true about medicine was completely ignored and there was almost some sort of weird magical thinking people had. They were believing things with no proof or solid evidence that these things were true or working. Masks were like a superstitious talisman and people were acting like peasants from the old country relying on "experts" telling them what to do. No one seemed to question a single thing. It felt creepy and wrong. </p>
<p>All the time I had a feeling in my gut that something was off. Then the riots started and at that point I knew deep down this was part of a much bigger agenda. That everything was connected. The pandemic, the race riots, the election. I noticed how news stories on the news app on my phone would go in Cycles, it was as if the media was flipping a switch on and off and I would get 10 articles in a row about the same thing, covid being deadly and killing millions of people and how we are all going to die if we don't do certain things. Then within 45 minutes I would get non-stop news articles about how Trump was an evil Nazi destroying our country. Then I would get news articles about white supremacy and how awful this country is. And it went in Cycles. And I noticed it and I started seeing the pattern.</p>
<p>When they declared racism a public health emergency at the same time they were telling us that we had to wear masks 24/7 and social distance and no large gatherings no church allowed no school no funerals  etc and all of that stuff and people were going by the thousands to protest in the heat of Summer shoulder-to-shoulder at that point I knew there was something very sinister going on. Our dipshit Mayor said testing places were not allowed to ask people if they had attended protests. Why weren't there entire communities of homeless people dropping dead? Obvious evidence that this wasn't what we were told were completely ignored and kept out of the MSM. Also I knew that reimbursements for Covid deaths were much higher and my workplace was instructed to list it on death certificates because of that even if a death was from a chronic disease and the person had no active covid symptoms. </p>
<p>I saw how vilified anyone who asked even a simple question was. The way people started screaming about believing the science was extremely culty and tipped me off that they were too lazy to really think for themselves.  I was amazed at how so many people seemed and still seem I under some sort of unbreakable spell with this. There is no reasoning or real honest discussion. The typical response when pointing out obvious issues here is anger, hatred, insults etc. Nothing about this is genuine. </p>
<p>I am now at a point where I feel that people who default to referrring to others as conspiracy theorists are the ones who have fallen for the actual conspiracy themselves.</p>

        <p>I always get the response “So what?? They made a fun video while on their 15 minute break to help relieve the enormous stress of working in health care during a ‘global pandemic.’” I’m no video expert, but I a suspect most of these viral nurse videos took a lot of time and energy to choreograph and produce. And then I see independent videos of empty hospitals, huge red flag. Thanks for the well written post.</p>
