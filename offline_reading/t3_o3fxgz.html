    <strong>GF will get the vaccine next thursday and I'm concerned.</strong>
    <p><p>Good day everyone!</p>
<p>I've been lurking on Reddit and on this sub for a while now and it feels good to know, that there are people out there that see this whole ordeal in a critical way and its potential for further infringement on civil rights and power grabs of governments.</p>
<p>I will keep this short.</p>
<p>I've been with my gf for 16 months now and we have quite different opinions on this whole scenario that is playing out. While we both fell for it hard at the beginning with all the fear porn coming from China of people dropping dead and so on. And I'm not downplaying that there is an unpredictable element to Covid-19 that is to be taken seriously, but the overall response to me seems so insane at this point. Making sense of it at this time is hard and I myself sometimes feel like losing my sanity, as the only person in my direct surroundings that is seeing through it is my dad.</p>
<p>My gf, on the other hand, is still very much caught in the official narrative and I know she is kinda knowing that something isn't right, but whenever we came to discuss this topic it immediately turned into a huge argument and she then calls me a conspiracy theorist. (That kinda hurts as well because I am and have always been a generally skeptical and critical person in regards to institutions of power and politicians in general.)</p>
<p>Now the thing is, I know people who got the vaccine and are fine, but I also know of people who for example, turned blind after receiving the vaccine, and yes one older person has died too. The whole thing is just shady as shit and I don't trust it and I personally decided for myself, not to take this vaccine. Does Covid have certain risks? Of course. No question. But so does the vaccine and some of these risks and are not even fully evaluated yet. There is no long-term data in that regard. "We just don't know."</p>
<p>I'm also following Bret Weinstein's Podcast and also recommended it to others to listen to, to no avail. I talked to friends about the risks with this. It fell on deaf ears. What's baffling to me is, that most people I know didn't get the vax because of them being afraid of covid, but rather because they wanted more freedom.. It's so sad to watch..  And with the person that is closest to me, it is the same thing. It makes me so sad and I often find myself in bouts of despair because I don't want anyone that I know to be hurt by this because they made the decision prematurely and based on a very on sided opinion on this whole thing.. (Of course everyone else as well, but I can't reach everyone. )</p>
<p>And Just to clarify, before anyone slams the "You AntiVaxxer"-Hammer on my head. I am Pro-Vax. And no Bill Gates doesn't want to implant chips in people. What he wants is money and he is making huge amounts with this vaccine.</p>
<p>I talked to her about the possible ramifications of this vaccine, I tried to show her voices of concern from many doctors using facts, I talked to her about the suppression of Ivermectin and that many women report changes to their menstrual cycle, or how that study from Japan released via the FIOA shows how these lipid nanoparticles circulate throughout the body and accumulate in the spleen or the ovaries. I also tried to show her, how these pharmaceutical companies only reported the RRR (relative risk reduction ) instead of the ARR (absolute risk reduction) because that RRR-Number is much bigger and seems more effective and promising.</p>
<p>But no matter what I try to show her she always says that it seems that I just want to be against the vaccine and that I don't check my sources correctly. This leaves me baffled. As I try to rely on sound information to present to her, to no avail. This is really frustrating and I start to doubt this relationship because I don't know if I can go through this with someone who just goes along with it. The thing is, I don't even want her to not get the vaccine, just not yet. I just want to present her with information from sources she doesn't look at since she mostly watches the news and official health advisers of the government. What's adding to this is that she is not in a good place mentally and it feels like she just wants to get the vaccine so that all of this ends. ( Surprise, it won't. A new variant will show up or something else will happen. )</p>
<p>This is really frustrating and I start to doubt this relationship because I don't know if I can go through this with someone who just goes along with it. But I really love her too and I don't want her to get hurt from this. I'm not even asking her to not get it, just to put it off for a while until she is in a better mental place to make this decision after having looked at other data/opinions. I also think that her family might be a reason for her to get it, as all 5 of them, parents and siblings, have been vaccinated and I can understand if the peer pressure is getting to her, but others won't have to suffer the consequences of your actions if they pressured you into doing something. That's on you.</p>
<p>So I'm coming to you for some sort of advice in this situation and maybe some good links to studies/articles that I can show her. I'm also working on a PDF with all my sources to give her to look through, even though she said that no matter what she'll get the vaccine.</p>
<p>Well damn, that post got longer than I thought! Thanks to anyone having taken the time to read and to everyone sharing some good sources.</p></p>

        <p>So you  showed her sources and viable information due to your concerns and she didn’t take you seriously. </p>
<p>16 months ain’t that long. I got some 16 month old tuna in my cabinet. </p>
<p>Might be better that you dodge the bullet now it may be a blessing in disguise.</p>

        <p>Nope - she didn't. I created a PDF with some links to studies and discussions from the Darkhorse Podcast, Dr. Pierre Kory, Dr. Byram Bridle, and others and she says she won't even look at it. Took me quite a few hours to find all the proper sources.    </p>
<p>I'll try to initiate another discussion with her, voicing my concerns while showing her the Studies and Articles I found.   </p>
<p>If this doesn't work, I don't know if this whole thing works..</p>

        <p>The fact that she’s so brainwashed and immediately labels you a conspiracy theorist just to shut down the topic is all you need to know. She doesn’t respect you and your feelings. </p>
<p>The decision is hers to make, obviously. But do you really want to be in a relationship with a person like that?</p>

<p>Of course it is and I won't stop her from doing so, she is free to do what she wants, but I'm, also free to end a relationship that I don't feel heard or taken seriously.</p>

        <p>I won't tell her not to get it. But the fact that she won't listen or read anything I offered, which are not crazy conspiracy articles, but voices of reason that sound the alarm bell, then I don't know what else to show her.   </p>
<p>She voices as well that she would feel more comfortable if I got it, which I promptly declined. I have decided for myself not to get it and nothing will make me do otherwise.</p>

        <p>You have presented sound facts and a reasonable argument as to why you should stay sceptical of this whole vaccine agenda, how the world has mishandled the pandemic, and suppression of vital information etc, but yet she still disregards, insults you and is still pushing ahead with taking the vaccine.</p>
<p>This is an example of somebody with no mettle; no fortitude, easily led, no critical thinking skills and disrespectful to boot. She is fallen too far down the rabbit hole. It is quite a blessing that only sixteen months in where you have made no lifelong commitments with her, that she reveals who she truly is in this way. If this sham of a pandemic has taught free-thinking people something, it is that people that blindly consume propaganda, fear-media and bury their head to the facts of the world fucking then up the ass are people to be avoided, or to be cut out of your life. These people will take the initiative themselves by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>excluding you from gatherings/events if you are unvaccinated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bully, coerce, threaten or guilt you into taking the vaccine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>stop contacting you altogether if you are unvaccinated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your girlfriend is a lost cause. No matter how much you try to help, it has been pointless. Best for you to end the relationship as quickly as you can. Is this really somebody that you would want to be raising your future children? Somebody who easily succumbs to fear media and propoganda despite being presented with perfectly logical facts?  Somebody who let's other people think for them? No solid basis of oneself? Thought not!</p>

        <p>If it were me I’d leave now and go find someone more on the same page because these differences aren’t going to get any better later on. You seem like very different people with different core beliefs, 16 months really isn’t long at all, they say people can put on a good act for a year or two before it gets hard to hide who they are.</p>

        <p>I fear the same thing.. In every other regard, we get along really well, but she is so incredibly stubborn and thick-headed sometimes, it's hard to get through. Anyways, I'll try to have a discussion with her tomorrow and see if I can get her to at least look at a few things that I found concerning. That's all I can do. And then I'll have to deeply think about if this relationship can continue.</p>

        <p>You're upset because she's not respecting your decision and research but you're also not respecting hers. I don't know either of you but it sounds like you want a compliant woman who will do what you say and not think for herself, someone who is not strong mentally. Which is odd to me because you say she is already mentally weak and just doing what other people say. It seems you're just upset that she's not listening to you. If she's completely dismissing what you say then it doesn't sound like a good sign for the relationship.</p>

        <p>I am in the same boat with my wife. She's fully vaxxed and still insists on masking up while out and about. She did finally loosen up enough to go on a nice nature walk with the kids last week. Started out demanding masks(I have never worn one outside), even though outside. By the first half mile, had given up on the mask since no one else in sight was wearing one. And we live in a very liberal area. I think just seeing real people living somewhat normally without fear and not dropping dead has been an anxiety reducing thing. Now she's actually talking about wanting to go on a vacation and other activities she wouldn't even consider a few weeks ago</p>

        <p>I, my girlfriend, and my kids all have the vaccine. I only tell you this in order to tell you that you are completely wrong. We don't know the long term effects of mRNA so it's impossible to say it's safe. Most of the information shows it is safe in the short term. But vaccines as a whole are not necessarily safe, there are always people who will have an adverse reaction or a person who will have an improperly administered shot.</p>
