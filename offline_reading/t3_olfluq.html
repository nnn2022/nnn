    <strong>I'm prepared to live as a second class citizen.</strong>
    <p><p>In England the party has passed a bill making it mandatory for all healthcare staff and care home workers to have the experimental mRNA jab or risk losing their jobs. 
This rule had already been decided a while ago as my neighbour works in a care home and was told over a month ago she needed the experimental jab or would loose her job. All that's changed is it's now law.</p>
<p>As we know, like all government virus they spread very quickly. It won't be long before all jobs will be made to require a person take an experimental jab before they can be employed. And then after boosters and variants are considered it will be to what level of jab you have had that will limit what job you can get. </p>
<p>At the moment I work for a factory that cares more about if you can do the job then what your medical history says. But even they are not exempt from the law. </p>
<p>I will never take any experimental jab for a virus that I have never had and will not kill me. After all, my body my choice, am I right? </p>
<p>I have already accepted that I will probably never travel abroad again. Having been lucky enough to go abroad on holiday at least once a year in the before times. </p>
<p>Public transport will probably be next. Trains, buses, taxis won't be able to get a ticket without a vaccine passport. </p>
<p>Then it will be certain establishments. Pubs and restaurants only allowing jabed person's. </p>
<p>Dispite all this, I am strong in my resolve to never jeopardise my health for purely social reasons. Which if you ask people why they took the jab will give you an answer that is purely a social one. Nothing to do with their health or being protected from a "virus". </p>
<p>Therefore I am ready for life to get a little harder, knowing that altho I might be a second class citizen I will be a free citizen. </p>
<p>Never forget. A man chooses, a slave obeys.</p>
<p>Edit: thank you so much for all the positive feedback. It's good to know I'm not alone. I know we will come out on top eventually. Keep fighting the good fight brothers!</p></p>

        <p>I still believe that the unvaccinated will have the better outcomes in the long term, but the next five years or so are going to get pretty hairy.  Now is the time to start preparing. If we can't legally work, then we'll need to become as self sufficient as possible - sooner or later, we're going to have to organise ourselves into unvaccinated communities where we can work together and find safety in numbers. Right now, we're too atomised and vulnerable.</p>

        <p>Hold your ground. Simple as that. Like Zammo, just say no. Call the bluff. This is a free society, no? You have the freedom to chose, no?</p>
<p>I think the legals will come. Remember, the gov has been quite careful so far. It has largely gotten the media and organisations to implement the restrictions. Such as public transport officials, local authority, corporations, schools etc. Very little has been forced mandatory apart from the lockdown of certain businesses. There legal recourse will come.</p>
<p>Just wait it out. Agreed, it is a bit shit but you are living through something pretty big. A serious upheaval. Something to tell your grandkids about. I have two teen daughters. They both hate the gov and see covid for what it is. They know that nobody they know has become seriously ill or died. They can use their judgement. We are talking about probably over 1000 people in the wider school community. Not a single covid horror story.</p>
<p>But I know of three vaccine injuries that are possibly permanent, long lasting in previously healthy people. Even if you do zero research, and I have done hundreds of hours, and just use word of mouth, it is easy to see that even at this early stage, taking the shot is a serious risk to your future health.</p>

        <p>I have had similar experiences. I work as a caregiver in a long term care fasility. We have had several covid outbreaks and none of these frail old people got sick enough to go to the hospital much less died of covid. The covid "vaccine" on the other hand HAS sent several to the hospital and even killed a couple of them. So from my experience the drug is MORE dangerous than the virus.</p>

        <p>Well they’d never stop you from going to supermarkets or even living your life’s. You’ve fraught against the British and in your own country and as far as I can see you won to a certain degree but life is all about certain wins and looses. It’s about the degree to which you win or loose that matters the most. Also don’t claim to know about Irish politics and will gladly be educated on the matters.</p>

        <p>Are you in Ireland now? I'm curious to know what the sentiment is towards the vaccine. I haven't really been able to travel back and at this stage, I'm considering just never returning due to the draconian requirements for getting into pubs.</p>

        <p>I'd take it one step further:  Learn archery with a variety of bows.</p>
<p>ETA:  Learn some basic bushcraft, like how to make a tripod for cooking over a fire.  Invest in a handful of cast iron dutch ovens and skillets.</p>

        <p>once you start looking into it, arrows and bows are easier then it seems “quality ones will take time and practice”. Making the bowstring is about the most difficult. Even then just taking some sinew(tendon) from an animal is tedious but life saving. Youtube tutorials on that one.</p>

        <p>U.K. here.</p>
<p>Regardless if they’ve made this “law” it isn’t enforceable due to this violating many many rights and overlapping other protection laws.</p>
<p>I’m part of many groups, on telegram:

Resistance united </p>
<p>To name a few. There are template letters for your employer. Whatever you do, DO NOT RESIGN. Be sacked first, claim unfair dismissal next.</p>
<p>We need to be united. The word will spread of all the unfair dismissal cases and businesses will not enforce this. Also under GDPR businesses or places of work have no duty to your medical information.</p>
<p>I cannot find the U.K./European letter, but this is the one for the USA. Same fundamentals though, do some research and add some tweaks:</p>

<p>&rt; Demand For Cessation of Unlawful Coercion, Invasion of Privacy, and Unlicensed Medical Practice</p>
<p>&rt; Date: July 15th, 2021</p>
<p>&rt; Dear <em>edited</em>
 
&rt; Your stated "requirement" issued on July 15th, 2021, that employees accept medical treatment as a condition of employment is unlawful and constitutes grounds for major remedy to employees wrongly coerced.</p>
<p>&rt; International law, Geneva conventions and the Nuremberg Codes, to which USA is a signator, prohibit coerced and forced medical treatments and any non-consensual medical treatment/s specifically including "vaccinations." This is especially true of experimental vaccines and vaccines that have not had full testing processes,have not had approval from the FDA, and have thereby not been proven safe to my satisfaction.</p>
<p>&rt; Covid-19 vaccines are experimental, are untested, have not had standard FDA process of approval, and are not shown to be safe. Various other Constitutional and Statutory authorities also support public protection against non-consensual vaccination such as statutes covering assault, public endangerment, unauthorized and unlicensed administration and practice of medicine and fundamental freedoms and rights guaranteed under the Bill of Rights.</p>
<p>&rt; You have failed in the requirement to show that:</p>
<p>&rt; (a) You are a licensed physician.</p>
<p>&rt; (b) I have consented to your recommended treatments.</p>
<p>&rt; (c) Your treatments are fully tested and proven safe.</p>
<p>&rt; Having so failed, your requirement that I submit to your requested medical treatments are unlawful and cause for major actions against you, your company and all complicit parties. If you have issued any “order” or “requirement” that employees be vaccinated without their express wish to be vaccinated based on their medical needs and desires, and threatened loss of job and financial hardship as a result of failure to submit to these demands, this is coercion. I will allow one week from this delivery for you to provide a clear and binding statement retracting that position AND declaring that vaccines and medical treatments are not a condition of my employment with your company. If, after that time I have not received that notice from you and/or an authorized party, you will be subject to major penalties and remedies and claim/s will be submitted which must be settled timely in order to avoid escalated claims.</p>
<p>&rt; Additionally, I refuse to submit medical records to you as a condition of my employment, discuss my medical treatments as decided by my physician, or submit to medical mandates and testing, including face coverings in a state where it has been declared unnecessary by the state governing authorities, as is my right as a citizen of the United States. </p>
<p>&rt; Your request forms for medical exemption imply that you have authority over my medical choices as a condition of my employment, and therefore require authorization for “exemption” of said authority.  I negate your authority to make medical decisions for me, and therefore I do not require medical exemption until such a time as you can prove in a court of law that you have the authority to make medical decisions on my behalf. </p>
<p>&rt; I also refuse to submit details of my spiritual, moral, or belief systems to you as a condition of my employment, as is my right as a citizen of the United States.  Your request forms for religious exemption require me to define my spiritual beliefs and practices to you, my employer, as a condition of my employment.  I negate your right to request any information as to my belief systems.</p>
<p>&rt; It is an impingement of my rights in this country for you to refuse me employment on the basis of my medical history, my spiritual practices, or failure to provide details of either of those things.  I refute any claims or rights you believe you hold to this information and will not be submitting either to you as a condition of my employment at <em>edited</em> University. </p>
<p>&rt; I have the right to believe what I wish, without defining it to you, and I have the right to decline your medical advice.  This is America.  We all still have rights over our own body autonomy, spiritual practices, and privacy and I find your requests for information to be a gross impingement on my constitutional rights.</p>
<p>&rt; You are in agreement with all terms and conditions herein unless you provide supported rebuttal within 30 days of this delivery. Any point herein that may be found to be in error or ineffective shall not diminish the effect of any other point herein.  A formal written copy of this notice has been mailed to your offices.</p>
<p>&rt; Sincerely, 
&rt; <em>edited</em></p>

        <p>If that's the hill you wanna die on I guess. While I am in utmost agreement with the sentiments described therein, what if my family's health insurance etc. is contingent upon employment? What if you're then on a list and you're one of the first ones they sick the "covid sniffing dogs" on and then haul off to a fema camp, put you on a ventilator, and "oh sorry, they died of covid alone in the camp, it was horrible, they should have just gotten vaccinated."</p>
<p>Our society may soon come to a point at which it is necessary to forge documents in order to retain our personal freedoms and our lives. I'm not advocating for the committing of any crime, but when confronted with blatant criminality and coercion such as this, it's hard to imagine much other recourse for these people. Like what if you are a person who is immunocompromised or dying and you still need to work to afford your treatments but the vaccine might kill you? </p>
<p>Unfortunately in the USA there are many people in this situation. If I were ever put in a situation of having to forge a document or probably die/ have a family member die because I won't be able to afford medical treatments, or else injecting myself with something that could kill me, I can't imagine me making the decision to do anything but to commit a crime. This is what they are forcing people to. They are creating more lawlessness. They are creating a society in which honest people are compelled to break the law. This is known as tyranny.</p>
<p>Now there are genocidal maniacs demanding your papers and complicity and perhaps your own death in their genocide generally. What do you do? You avoid getting genocided any way you can, you avoid that if you can for you and your family. That's all you can do. Once they're injecting people with deadly poisons, everything is on the table folks. Do what you gotta do to protect yourself and your family.</p>
<p>Right now they are going door to door compiling their lists. My answer is going to be that I've already been vaccinated and so has my whole family, down to all my kids. They can take my answer, the papers are in my office elsewhere, and I don't have to show them. I'll thank them for their good work that they are doing and send them on their way. Because I'm not getting put on a list with my family's name and address on it that genocidal maniacs might use in a couple years to round us up and throw us in death camps.</p>

        <p>I honestly feel for you and completely agree with everything you’ve said. It is going to be an us v them mentality and I fear that they do the fema camp.</p>
<p>The difference being in the U.K. healthcare is free, all medical staff have taken the Hippocratic oath in the U.K., they cannot refuse to treat someone based upon a vaccination status nor can they refuse treatment if you refuse to wear a mask.</p>
<p>In terms of the health insurance, if your successful in a unfair dismissal case surely this should override the policy wording as you’ve been dismissed from work due to discrimination. Again I can’t really comment I apologise as I’m not a US citizen.</p>
<p>Our society may need to forge documents and I will certainly be taken pride in this - I will not be made guilty or feel like I’m the one making a crime when we are living in this global reset with mass crimes against humanity.</p>
<p>The only way we can win this is if we all stick together. It’s going to be hard but we need to do it.</p>

<p>This is my strategy too. It's too early in the game to show your hand, get put on a list, and have it bite you in the ass later. Somewhere down the line if they find out I'm unvaxxed, it won't be from me. Make them work for it</p>

        <p>I need major surgery that’s been cancelled 3 times but I have food in my fridge, Eletric and bed to sleep in. I ain’t working at the moment but I’d wear a mask at all, so I’d be sacked tbh. I also won’t take the jab but thanks for asking. Crazier things are yet to come as life is imitating art/films. Predictive programming at its finest. Also my mum lost her job today but hadn’t worked for 13 months and used to go on 2 holiday a years. She’s had 2 jabs and still can’t go on holiday if she had the money. So why bother?</p>

        <p>And yeah I love watching people all confused at how they followed all the rules like a good citizen and still don’t have freedom. It’s not like we didn’t warn them. We aren’t confused.</p>
<p>Btw you can still go places. My girlfriend is unjabbed and currently in Croatia, it’s a bit of a ballache getting people to understand there is no law to make you wear a mask or take a test but they get it eventually.</p>
<p>Went to Portugal twice last year no masks no tests before I lost my job that was.</p>

        <p>Hope the surgery gets sorted mate. Lost my job too for complicated reasons but I would have been sacked eventually anyway. I ran an office and refused to tell people to wear masks. I put up all the signs and the sanitiser stations no problem but I would not tell people not to come in and I would not tell them off for not wearing a mask. I was forced about about “something else” but we all know where it was headed. </p>
<p>Currently enjoying freedom like I’ve never had (restricted to this country sure) earning money my own way and getting money from government too. I’ll take it while it lasts.</p>

        <p>Good luck to you across the pond, brother. Unfortunately in your country it's far easier for the government to exert control over all areas, being so geographically small, and what with your people being disarmed. My hope over here in the US is that in rural enough places with low enough populations things may continue on mostly as normal. But even here it seems that for the next while it may be a requirement for employment at most corporate workplaces. The trick may be to work for a small business if you can find one of those that the government hasn't completely destroyed yet. Or you can always work like a migrant laborer for cash under the table doing construction or janitorial work or working in the back of a kitchen.</p>

        <p>Fellow Brit here. I couldn't agree more. I'm planning on just waiting it out no matter how much pressure they exert. I can live without all the things they're threatening us with. No cinema? No worries, I have a projector at home. No restaurants? I love cooking and can always order delivery? Forced vaccination at work? I'll change jobs. Can't enter shops? No problem, I'll just continue ordering on the internet...etc</p>
<p>It's all bluff anyway. The economy can't possibly survive if they carry through on their threats. Pubs and restaurants are already struggling as it is. Just sit and wait it out...

        <p>I'm with you. I also believe that things will get worse in terms of vax passports and countries reinstating restrictions over the next few months. Most of the people in my age group that I've spoken with about this have chosen to get vaccinated purely so they can travel again, however, if we go into lockdown again this fall, they won't even be able to do that. If everyone I know who got vaccinated is healthy a year from now, I may consider getting vaxxed if it means I can travel internationally again. However, my theory is that there's going to be a lot more suffering from side effects of this vaccine, fertility issues, and unfortunate deaths. Right now, they're using variants and "long covid" as a way to cover it up, but as more people get vaccinated and the booster jabs come out, governments will eventually have to change their tune. I hope I'm wrong though, I really don't want to see anyone I care about suffer from their decision to get vaccinated.</p>

<p>Don't think they'll make them mandatory at most workplaces. I know people that took the vaccine (Thankfully they didn't have side effects) and they never received anything to prove it lol. Must've lucked out and been in the placebo group.</p>
