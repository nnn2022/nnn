    <strong>Permabanned from r/covid_vaccinated for Quoting an Immunologist</strong>
    <p><p>Someone made a comment about how he heard that some sort of toxins accumulate in the ovaries and I responded with exactly this:</p>
<p>&rt;"In short, the conclusion is, we made a big mistake. We didn't realize it until now. We thought the spike protein was a great targeted antigen. We never knew the spike protein itself was a toxin and was a pathogenic protein. So by vaccinating people we are inadvertently innoculating them with a toxin. [For] some people this gets into circulation and when that happens, in some people it can cause damage especially in the cardiovascular system and I have many other, I dont have time, but many other legitimate questions about the long-term safety there for this vaccine. For example, with that accumulating in the ovaries, one of my questions is, will we be rendering young people infertile? Some of them infertile. So I'll stop there. I know it's heavy-hitting"      -Dr. Byram Bridle, Professor on Viral Immunology at the University of Guelph, On Point with Alex Pierson, May 27th 2021</p>
<p>How can quoting an expert in the field be called misinformation? This implies that the random jannie who banned me is more knowledgeable in immunology than an actual teaching immunologist who works at a college. A Canadian college no less! You dont even have to trust the evil US government and its horrible profit-motivated medical system!</p>
<p>Seriously though allowing a random neckbeard mod/admin to call actual research from certified medical professionals "misinformation" even though it is factually accurate and mostly just asking questions is insane. How did these types end up with this much unchecked power?</p></p>
