    <strong>Just a thought</strong>
    <p><p>With the nature of travel and potential for new diseases then why isn’t COVID a nessicairy practice run for a more deadly virus? Like if a plague hits we’d want infrastructure in place to deal, and we’re getting that now right? I don’t want no smoke, I’m just asking questions. And if it comes to a security vs. liberty debate isn’t the answer always choose both?</p></p>

        <p>In a sane world, anti-plague infrastructure would entail sacrifices by bigwigs and include, as standard:</p>
<ol>
<li>A healthy population: companies wouldn't be allowed to peddle processed trash 'food' and keep us seated and dosed up on pharmaceuticals 12+ hours a day.</li>
<li>Sufficient healthcare, which has enough for everyone who needs it (instead of entering crisis every flu season because of chronic under-investment).</li>
<li>Sufficient living space for people in poorer households: there should be a minimum size of house, with developers and slumlords not allowed to rent or sell airing cupboards for the sake of profit.</li>
<li>Green, outdoor space people can congregate effectively even if a virus is highly lethal and they do have to distance. Currently, all such space (at least in the UK) is sold off to developers for yet more miniscule homes.</li>
<li>Healthcare measures, such as UV light, on spacious and efficient public transport, instead of the hand-sanistiser-in-a-tin-can crapshoot currently on offer.</li>
</ol>
<p>But this is not a sane world. In the response to SARS-CoV-2, companies and governments have excused themselves all their failings and thrown the <em>entire</em> burden - together with the full force of the law - on small businesses and private citizens. They've used the pandemic as a chance to extend micromanagement into our lives and claim our savings and assets, but they've not actually done anything other than issue orders and airbrush history.</p>

        <p>Fuckin’ A. Those are some good ideas, but we’d have to rebuild society from the ground up to achieve all of that.</p>
