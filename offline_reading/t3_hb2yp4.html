    <strong>Do NOT support "new normal" style reopenings</strong>
    <p><p>Favorite store requires you to wear a mask? Well they won't be getting any of my money. I'm taking my business elsewhere. </p>
<p>Favorite restaurant has ridiculous social distancing policies? Fuck em, I'll continue cooking my own food. They don't need my money. </p>
<p>Favorite sports league has fake crowd noises and dystopian messages? Subscription cancelled. I'll get my entertainment from something else. </p>
<p>No compromises. Don't be weak. None of this "well I'll just spend less than I usually do..." NO. <strong>Do NOT spend ANY money on these new normal reopenings</strong>. That is how we get back to actual normal.</p></p>

        <p>I am conflicted because it’s truly the government at fault for this, not the small businesses trying to kiss the government’s ass to survive. The business can get shut down entirely BY the government for not following the government’s orders even though it’s all bullshit. Especially with Karens/COVID-Doomers/snitches. If everyone banded together to go to businesses and join as a union 1) not to do the new normal BUT ALSO 2) not to snitch on the business, it’s possible.</p>

        <p>This is true. Some of this is government mandated. I feel bad for the 65 year old woman that is waiting tables and her employer makes her wear a mask. Seeing the person and their smile/personality is a huge part of that job. The other part is the business not wanting the Twitter Karen snitches to complain to the health department or on social media.</p>

        <p>Twitter Karen's are twitter bots... I never met anybody who actually use twitter, literally. The only people with twitter are celebrities, businesses, politicians and that kind of crowd. When ever you see " outrage " and shame posting on twitter for those who don't follow this Orwellian crap, it's a bot. </p>
<p>It's all a fugazi, almost everything online is astroturfing, especially social media's. People need to realize the online world has become one big giant propaganda sham. I noticed the propaganda networks now use the posts of twitter bots as examples in their articles of " outrage " when pushing this Orwellian lockdown hoax.</p>

        <p>Oh God. Do you honestly believe busybody controlfreaks don't exist in the world? Because, I can assure you, they do. They're not all bots, and I think most of them are real people. Fucked up people, but still human beings. </p>
<p>Besides, do you think propaganda would be a thing if it didn't affect and alter people's behaviors? If there is no sweeping social change, they'd discard it for something else, and you know it.</p>

        <p>Yes this is a good point and I did think about this before posting my thread. I suppose I underestimated the snitching part of the problem that could actually get businesses in trouble.</p>
<p>I don't see what else we can do though. If we start complying with these ridiculous new normal practices and spend our money just as before, then the government has no reason to lift restrictions. Why would they since the population and economy are functioning perfectly again? Once freedoms are taken away, they aren't given back easily. We need to make a statement against the new normal with our wallets.</p>

        <p>This is definitely important to remember. I try to make sure I know exactly what is and isn’t required by my state. If a business enforces more than that, I don’t go there, but I definitely don’t want to punish a business just for doing what they’re required to do to get by.</p>
<p>I definitely won’t be snitching if I notice a place cutting corners! I’m actually glad to see it and hope they’ll keep getting away with it.</p>

        <p>There are exceptions to government mandated measures. IE: requirement to wear masks, every document I have seen about it has exclusions for people who cant wear masks for medical reasons (asthma, breathing issues etc). Then its up to the business how they want to proceed. I have tested it few times and while everywhere I went so far didnt reprimand me for not having a mask on (went to get my hair done, other treatments) but my massage studio had strict mask on during massage requirement, when I emailed them to say Im not able to wear a mask for an hour while lying face down (cos its ridiculous to start with) they said ok come back when its no longer required. They could have accommodated me and they chose not to which is fair enough, I went elsewhere.</p>

        <p>I don't. I refuse to set foot in any place that requires a mask or actually enforces those stupid markers on the floor. I learned the hard way through all of this that your most important vote is your dollar and that you have to be very, VERY careful about where you spend your money.</p>

        <p>I think it’s also worthwhile to make complaints about these things in addition to not supporting them with business. That helps make it clear that the reason some people aren’t turning up is because they hate the “safety” measures (not out of fear or whatever else), and the more people clearly dislike the measures, the more likely they’ll be gone as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I think to an extent this even applies to things enforced by the state — don’t take it out on the business when they’re just doing what they’re being forced to do, but politely expressing how much you dislike it (while acknowledging that you know it isn’t their fault) still might contribute in a small way to speeding along the process of getting rid of the whole circus act.</p>

        <p>I feel bad for the businesses who are being forced into these shenanigans. They just want to have happy customers and make money.  They're between a rock and a hard place - the government forcing absurd regulations, and those customers who feel that they are life-or-death necessary.  You can try to please the freedom-loving customers but then the fearful customers will snitch and you'll lose their the business of the fearful, too.</p>
<p>But, perhaps this will cause the business owners to push back harder against the government.  Here in PA, our legislators are obviously listening, because they passed a law which invalidated most of the governor's regulations, and now they're trying to push forward an impeachment resolution against the governor.  He said immediately he'd veto the first, and the chances of the impeachment going through aren't that good. But if we keep pushing and emphasize we're going to vote out anyone who continued and defended these regulations too long, they might have to relent.</p>

        <p>I agree. One of my favourite local clothing stores will not be getting my business because they require masks. They sent out an online survey to customers and I stated that "I prefer a relaxed, natural environment to zero risk."</p>

        <p>Here in Virginia, we have a mask order for all indoor businesses. It's supposed to be enforced by the Department of Health but I see a lot of people ignoring it so I do my best to do the same.</p>

        <p>I'd support small businesses as they have no option. Either go out of business or give in to this BS, but for big stores, companies etc fuck em. I'll buy somewhere else where i can browse the fucking store. A video game store reopened near me and i was very excited.  a guy was at the entrance saying you could only come to collect things or know exactly what you needed, no browsing. Most sales are from people going in and buying random shit. I went to the bank and within 0.1 secs of entering a lady with a poor fitted face shield barely covering her nose poured sanitizer on my hands.    Completely put me off going back until this BS ends. Even in UK streets we have stickers on side walks reminding us to remain 2M apart.</p>

        <p>I'm in the Bay Area, California, where the government forces businesses to "require" masks. As long as the store still allows me to shop without a mask, they will get my business. The government does not, however, force businesses to refuse cash or to close dressing rooms. So I won't shop at an ice cream shop that doesn't take cash or a clothing store that keeps their dressing rooms closed.</p>

        <p>Same in L.A. I won’t shop anywhere that requires people to stand outside in a long line just to enter (ie Trader Joe’s and most of the other healthier options). I’m still supporting local restaurants despite the mask law because I feel they genuinely need the help. I understand that they are just trying to follow the law in order to keep their businesses running. </p>
<p>It’s different across different parts of LA county though. I was in a different part of the city the other day and absolutely no one was wearing masks. I was even able to enter a gas station for the first time without one. Where I live, I would have been immediately reprimanded. It’s already happened once before.</p>

        <p>Since masks are required everywhere in PA (as far as businesses go; they’re not requiring them just outdoors when you’re hiking or anything), I make my choices based on other rules the businesses might make up. Two restaurants said they are taking customers’ temperatures, so I won’t go there. I get that probably every hair salon is going to do that, but most restaurants so far aren’t doing temp checks on customers.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, this isn't feasible in many cases. Spending less money isn't as good as spending no money, but it's better than spending more money. I totally get your sentiment though.</p>

        <p>Money talks, bullshit walks. Do I miss going to breweries? Hell yeah. But if they want to kowtow to paranoid masky types, they won't be getting a damn cent from me. I can go without it.</p>
<p>My stylist wants to do Howie Mandel role play to get a haircut and jack up her prices? Meh, it's hair not a tumor. I can let it grow a little longer.</p>
