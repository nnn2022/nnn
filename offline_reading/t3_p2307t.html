    <strong>So this will get me banned but I don't care</strong>
    <p><p>You dumb asses resisting vaccination and masks are why we're now at over a year of this pandemic causeing a "new normal". The new normal is that because a group of uneducated neanderthals refuses to accept the science behind this virus and prevention we've now been in masks for over a year. A fucking year. I didn't get to walk for my graduation for my undergrad, I haven't had in person classes for my masters program, I can't find a fucking job because nobody is hiring. I'm working construction for my father in law instead of doing research in the lab I worked for for 2 years before this shit. I didn't get to publish in a scientific journal because of fucks like you who can't just wear a god damn mask because it's not comfortable. My lab was shut for the last month and a half of the semester so I couldn't finish the last leg of my research. My gripes aren't much compared to those who have lost loved ones but it's still fucking sucks. I haven't been able to see my mom for almost 2 months because she can't get the vaccine until she comes off the steroid she's on to let her eat and function normally. So fuck all of you that are keeping me from seeing her by not doing your part in shortening this pandemic. If you don't want a new normal of mask wearing then suck it the fuck up and wear a damn mask for the next few months and get the fucking vaccine. Fuck all of you and may you stay healthy.

        <p>How. Every time something like this has happened (most recently the 1914 flu pandemic on this scale at least) every thing went back to normal after it was over. You get a flu shot as a result of variences in the flu every year but we're not in masks still from that. There's no historic prescident for masks being made permanently manditory.</p>

        <p>I doubt you speak any truth, because your sentence structure is arguably the most atrocious thing I have ever seen in my life. Regardless I‚Äôm vaccinated and I will definitely support the cause of not vaccinating because there is CLEARLY a deficiency of data IN ALL the trials for mRNA, and MILLIONS HAVE SUFFERED permanent injury from these vaccines INCLUDING MYSELF. SINCERELY A PRE ENGINEERING STUDENT. ALSO THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU AT ALL, and to fit their narrative you may be more useful dead to stop global warming.</p>

I really want to know, do you really believe that something that is definitely causing autoimmune disease at significant rates and clearly killing a lot of people and definitely has no data on the long term side effects better than covid? Why not use antiviral medicine for covid, why a vaccine that doesn‚Äôt provide protection without significant risk, and that protect doesn‚Äôt stop its mutations or evolutionary steps towards becoming a deadlier disease. Do you even research how ineffective vaccines can create deadlier pathogens? You have a lot to learn good sir, I am vaccinated and I regret it everyday because my doctors says could be permanent numbness on the entire left side of my body, while every god damn person I personally know who got covid is alive and doing VERY well. I will NEVER BE COMPENSATED.</p>

<p>\&rt; I haven't been able to see my mom for almost 2 months because she can't get the vaccine until she comes off the steroid she's on to let her eat and function normally. So fuck all of you that are keeping me from seeing her by not doing your part in shortening this pandemic.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>That doesn't even make any sense mate. How am I responsible for your mom being on steroids and not being able to get the vaccine? If I injected every vaccine known to man, your mom would still be in that predicament</p>

        <p>That's weird. It would seem to me like its more likely that the people doing the shut downs are responsible for the shut downs...you know, since they are literally ordering shut downs. I'm starting to think Covid has nothing to do with why you didn't get a degree.</p>

        <p>Cry me a river! Check your "vaccinated privilege" at the door and stop redirecting your anger towards people on this sub reddit, and start understanding this one principle in life:</p>
<p>"shit happens!"</p>
<p>We all lost things from this covid situation, some people gained. I worked 10 years after college to land my dream job, paid off all my school debt to only now possibly lose my career from COVID!</p>
<p>When I graduated college the housing market and banking system was on the brink of collapse and the economy was about to experience the "great depression" all over again. No one could find a job out of college for years, or you were stuck working a shit job that no one wanted. Oh and before that I had friends who came back from Afghanistan or Iraq with PTSD, from the wars after 9/11 I had to witness since I was younger than you.</p>
<p>Unemployment was hitting near 10%, gas was $4.50 a gallon, oil was $180 a barrel and the government and federal reserve bailed out the banks. At least the government gave out bribes to the people this time around through "stimulus checks".</p>
<p>Be happy you have a degree.</p>
<p>BTW, today I just found out two of my friends, whom are fully vaccinated, are both sick from COVID stuck in bed and are quarantining with fever and the whole range of symptoms. I also have a family member who died after the shot, and know people who died from COVID complications.</p>
<p>Stop taking your childish frustrations out on others, go watch some more mindless Tik Tok, keep soaking up the propaganda that Covid came from some Chinese wet market person eating bat soup, and grow a pair.</p>

        <p>I think you meant to post this here...r/CovidVaccinated.</p>
<p>They are the new super spreaders after all.</p>
<p>Sorry about your life. We don't need any more deranged individuals in labs right now anyways, thank you. We have enough chimeric abominations happening with the people already present.</p>
<p>Also, for all your stated education, your commentary is droll and sophomoric. Let that be a clue that you might not be as smart as you suppose.</p>
<p>Regardless, thanks for the uplifting words. Just remember, we are fighting for your freedom too, whether you currently value it or not.</p>

<p>Lol I don't even know who you are, but I live with my unvaxed parents who are healthy, and if my grandparents didn't live in another country I would be seeing them every week also. </p>
<p>You can only blame your government, Saint Fauci, the CDC/FDA/NIH/WHO, and especially the WEF for creating this lockdown and suspending your and our freedoms and rights. Also a shoutout to Mr. Gates for having planned this whole operation 10 years ago!</p>
