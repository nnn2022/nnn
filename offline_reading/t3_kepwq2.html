    <strong>Inner thoughts of my "New Normal"</strong>
    <p><p>Sometimes I wish I could go to sleep and never wake up.  I'm tired.  I mean this in a mental sense - I'm absolutely exhausted.  There's a lingering pain in my head and I can never seem to make it go away.  I feel like I don't have a purpose anymore.  To clarify what I mean by anymore, is that I felt like I did pre-Covid.  I was happy, but didn't even realize it at the time.  And now that I look back, it was some of the best times of my life.  Looking at the present, I've lost everything that I've worked towards.  I can no longer go to work and work with my team.  Most have quit and moved on.  I don't blame them at all.  None of us expected this to go on for this long.  I've been forced to either work at my house in the same room I sleep in or to go into an office that is totally void of humanity.  I can't go to the gym anymore, a place of therapy for me, because I refuse to wear a mask.  I haven't worn one since I saw this all for what it was since April after the "2 weeks to flatten the curve" propaganda kept getting extended.  As a result, I'm harassed in almost every place I go, asked to leave by my own neighbors and countrymen, the same people I would defend with my own life.  I've lost some of my friends for my beliefs, some don't want to go out with me to eat or anywhere else as I could "cause a scene".  Many have retreated to lives of anti-social nature.  I am no different.  I have seen the implementation of mass surveillance as a result of theft as a result of masks and the beginning of the elimination of cash.  I'm seeing the media turn the People against the police and in turn the police will eventually turn on the People.  I'm seeing systemic slavery of the working class.  I'm seeing a close family member of mine denied his 6th amendment rights, like many others he's been locked up in jail for 9 months, as a result of the Covid regulations on the judicial system, which is totally failing.  This is all for a crime that I am absolutely 100% sure he is innocent of.  They have stolen his life from him.  But most terrifying of all, I'm seeing how easily my generation has given up their essential liberties and knowing that it has not gone unnoticed by those seeking to take advantage.  I fear it is only downhill from here.  Something truly sinister is beyond the horizon.  May God have mercy on us all.</p></p>

        <p>I hear you but I think we need to find positive ways forward. We're in the minority against tyranny, so if we give up, there's no one left. </p>
<p>There are so many ways you can fight back. We are the resistance in this war.</p>
