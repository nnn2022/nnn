    <strong>Everyone who claims to have stayed home the entirety of the past year lives with family, a significant other, or at least roommates</strong>
    <p><p>Full disclaimer:  I don't entirely agree with the general sentiment on this sub, but I do agree with your disdain for society's judgmental attitude towards those who speak "out of line" on the topic.  I therefore figured this would be a "safe space" in which to share my observation.</p>
<p>"Just stay home!  What's so hard about that?"  Yeah, no shit--when you have emotional support and companionship built into your home, maybe that is an option.  But for those who live alone, staying home for ten months (except to get groceries or whatever) simply isn't an option.  It's emotional suicide.  Just about everyone I know who lives alone takes more liberties (weekend trips with friends, etc) than those who don't, even if they don't readily admit it.</p>
<p>I'm just so sick of hearing, "We haven't seen anyone all year!"  Yeah, keyword here being <strong>WE</strong>.  People who live with loved ones, or at least friends, should count their blessings and ease up on the judgment of those who aren't so lucky.</p></p>

        <p>I agree. </p>
<p>My husband was deployed when Covid hit and it drove me mad when people would correct me when I said I was “alone” during lockdown. The correction didn’t refer to my child—nope, it was all these people insisting they were “there” for me from afar. Oddly none of my actual support network ever corrected my “alone” language. </p>
<p>My experience has left me deeply troubled about the plight of those who actually live all alone, without even a child to keep them company, as well as solo/single parents who have had to brave this mess on their own. Evil and cruel are the only words I can think of to describe what I feel has been done to solo adults. </p>
<p>Before Covid, I spent a bit of time at a tabletop gaming store. It was a nice place to meet new people and play various games in an open and happy atmosphere. MANY of the folks I met there live alone. I’ve been worried about so many of them throughout this past year, forever hoping none of them die from suicide or drug overdose or a similar fate due to loneliness. I know plenty got their primary social contact outside work at the store and at nearby restaurants when gaming groups would go get dinner or coffee together.</p>

        <p>Yes, I keep saying this to people! I'm home (single) with my preteen/young-teen kids, and am going crazy. I really do not think it is normal or healthy for the only social input to be from one's kids. I was viciously attacked for going out ONCE with friends and posting pics, and I'm kinda scarred from that social media experience (I still go out every now and then - I just rarely post pics). It's been almost a year since I was accused of spreading covid everywhere, and I've still never had it that I know of.</p>

        <p>That's true. I live with one family member and I'm getting pretty bored, even though I go out more than most people do during "lockdown," so I can only imagine how much it sucks to be alone, especially for those who don't go out much.</p>

        <p>I'm in Canada, too. I'm sorry you didn't have internet for that long! That must have really contributed to boredom/loneliness since almost anything to do is on the internet now. Glad you do have it again. I like skating so at least I've been out to skate on outdoor rinks. I had paddleboarding in the summer, too. I didn't realize how much paddleboarding was keeping me sane until it was over for the year due to the weather. I bike sometimes, too, but I don't like it as much.</p>

        <p>WHY stay at home? WHY give up your freedom?</p>
<p>Because Fauci said so? He's been wrong more times than we can count. And he's lied even more than that.</p>
<p>If u live in a lockdown state/country my prayers go out to you because the fact is that u are being lied to. U don't have to live a lockdown life. </p>
<p>The evidence of analytical data shows lockdowns and masks don't work - just compare Florida vs pretty much anywhere that is mask/lockdown and Florida wins.</p>
<p>By the grace of God (and Gov DeSantis) Florida is open and most of our counties don't even have a mask mandate. The evidence of your eyes shows the people in Florida are not dying - despite being able to go to bars, gyms, school, sports, Trump Rallies, and the Super Bowl. </p>
<p>Lockdowns don't work. It's time to open the world again.</p>

<p>This is simply not true, as there are many people here who don't live alone who are suffering. Same with people who live alone and also support lockdowns. </p>
