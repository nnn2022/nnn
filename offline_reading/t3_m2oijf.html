        <p>Hey, I am not really part of this community as far as beliefs, just putting that out there beforehand and that I am just genuinely curious how you feel about this:</p>
<p>I understand the concern about long term effects of the vaccines. Now, this is purely my personal experience, but the overlap between people I have found between those who are unconcerned about "long COVID," just general long term unknown effects, and those who are concerned about long term effects of the vaccine is almost 100%. This is a confusing discrepancy to me. How do you feel about the distinction?</p>

        <p>Thank you for being civil so far.</p>
<p>First of all, I have 0 problems with the vaccine, unless it's somewhat mandatory. A brand new vaccine shouldn't be mandatory, unless it's for a really deadly disease, and even then I'd take a mandatory vax over bullshit like domestic vaccine passports. A mandatory vax is a somewhat temporary measure, while vaccine passes are for life. I can follow rules and I can do things for the good of society but I absolutely hate the idea of total surveillance and control. No 'Papers, please'. Once we show that we accept something like this, something worse will come. Like social credit system. It won't end here because the fabric of society has been torn. A vaccine shouldn't be used as a tool to gain our lives back, but rather as a needed prevention and protection against a disease which can be quite deadly for the elderly. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p>Second, the effects of long covid shouldn't be entirely unknown by now. The first cases were detected in October-November 2019, which is nearly year and a half ago. We also have information about the long term effects on patients who suffered SARS back in 2003. So far, do we know of someone who lost their sight due to covid? No. Do we know of someone who became paralyzed due to covid? Also no. Do we know of any fertility problems? Nope. Do we know of someone who's still struggling to climb the stairs? Yes. Do we know of someone with fucked lungs? Also yes, but that person was probably in their late 60s-70s, with comorbidities. I am willing to accept any nasty effects that I might get from covid, just like someone who took the new vaccine voluntarily should be able to accept any side effects from that. This would have been enough to get back to normal, if we lived in a normal, sane world. But we don't.</p>

        <p>I'm with you on the mandatory vaccine unease and definitely the passport requirement idea. In some cases either idea may be more or less necessary perhaps, but even in those cases it should be treated with caution. Maybe the passport one less so if done years after a vaccine release, but at that point why bother? Either way, the precedent there is an important one. </p>
<p>I'd agree we have learned a lot in the past year, so the prospect of unknown effects from COVID is not as scary as it might have been, though personally I do find the loss of sense/smell, for months at a time in some cases, pretty disturbing. It would be terrible enough to have to simply go through that but the neurological cause and full effects of that still aren't fully understood from what I know.</p>
<p>I wouldn't push anyone to take the vaccine. That's just not going to be productive even if I think it's the best course. The differing perception of the "danger of the unknown" there from COVID, especially early on, and the vaccine is pretty wide, though, and I don't think it makes a lot of sense, which is what prompted the curiosity to ask.</p>
<p>Thanks for responding!</p>

        <p><strong>This was my original thought as well,</strong> that a digital certificate would be used where it was needed, which is how it was originally framed. However we've seen this agenda explode since then with mention of CommonPass vaccine passports worlwide. Don't get confused, <em>this isn't about safety or medicine at all,</em> it's about control.</p>

        <p>That’s what they say it’s for, but you also have millions of Americans who are homeless or in poverty who can’t afford or just can’t get the newest technology. The chip will go for us because of that</p>

        <p>Can we all just admit it’s a shame the people who want this kind of stuff are greedy, evil, fucks? All the cool futuristic stuff is always bad because the people wanting to use it never wants to just let it be used for good</p>

        <p>Yes cause the cell phones we carry everywhere and the apps and websites aren’t tracking our location. Bill Gates really needs to know what you are up to. Where you also at the capitol on the 6th?</p>

        <p>Are you saying that the scientists working on tiny implantable micro chips are doing all this work for nothing? Why don't you go and tell Bill Gates that instead of quantum dot tattoos he should invest in big bulky smartphones that people keep losing and dropping? Wow, you're so 2013. Do you even respect the science?</p>
