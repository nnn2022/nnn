        <p>The fact that they were the hosts of Event 201 is a coincidence of course.</p>
<p>Either I'm a paranoid "conspiracy theorist" who needs to be medicated, or the general public are fucking blind.</p>
<p>EDIT 1: The article is shocking by the way. It is written in a voice which sounds like that of someone who has been merged totally with a kind of totalitarian non-human(or perhaps simply inhuman) force which constantly reassures the public about how life is much better now that there is no human freedom.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: I scarcely believe this agenda was conceived by human minds. COVID-19 is a manufactured crisis event to expedite our transition into a world such as the one described here using all the attacks on liberty and free speech and the social conditioning and technocratic control measures that have, and will be introduced in its wake. I have a hard time seeing how it could be otherwise.</p>
<p>EDIT 3: I've always been agnostic about the long standing belief in a globalist cabal manipulating events to lead us to a fascistic global transhumanist technocracy. There can be no doubt now, surely.</p>

        <p>That's the thing. It sounds ridiculous and "like something out of a movie" but everything that's been happening from contact tracing (aka more surveillance) to the medical martial law to masks to the "New Normal" propaganda to everything else in-between just aligns with the plans as outlined in these documents.</p>
<p>Anyway, here is an excerpt from this page:</p>
<p>&rt; Welcome to the year 2030. Welcome to my city - or should I say, "our city". I don't own anything. I don't own a car. I don't own a house. I don't own any appliances or any clothes.</p>
<p>&rt; It might seem odd to you, but it makes perfect sense for us in this city. Everything you considered a product, has now become a service. We have access to transportation, accommodation, food and all the things we need in our daily lives. One by one all these things became free, so it ended up not making sense for us to own much.</p>
<p>&rt; First communication became digitized and free to everyone. Then, when clean energy became free, things started to move quickly. Transportation dropped dramatically in price. It made no sense for us to own cars anymore, because we could call a driverless vehicle or a flying car for longer journeys within minutes. We started transporting ourselves in a much more organized and coordinated way when public transport became easier, quicker and more convenient than the car. Now I can hardly believe that we accepted congestion and traffic jams, not to mention the air pollution from combustion engines. What were we thinking?</p>
<p>&rt; Sometimes I use my bike when I go to see some of my friends. I enjoy the exercise and the ride. It kind of gets the soul to come along on the journey. Funny how some things seem never seem to lose their excitement: walking, biking, cooking, drawing and growing plants. It makes perfect sense and reminds us of how our culture emerged out of a close relationship with nature.</p>
<p>&rt; In our city we don't pay any rent, because someone else is using our free space whenever we do not need it. My living room is used for business meetings when I am not there.</p>
<p>&rt; Once in awhile, I will choose to cook for myself. It is easy - the necessary kitchen equipment is delivered at my door within minutes. Since transport became free, we stopped having all those things stuffed into our home. Why keep a pasta-maker and a crepe cooker crammed into our cupboards? We can just order them when we need them.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>&rt; Shopping? I can't really remember what that is. For most of us, it has been turned into choosing things to use. Sometimes I find this fun, and sometimes I just want the algorithm to do it for me. It knows my taste better than I do by now.</p>
<p>&rt; When AI and robots took over so much of our work, we suddenly had time to eat well, sleep well and spend time with other people. The concept of rush hour makes no sense anymore, since the work that we do can be done at any time. I don't really know if I would call it work anymore. It is more like thinking-time, creation-time and development-time.</p>
<p>&rt; For a while, everything was turned into entertainment and people did not want to bother themselves with difficult issues. It was only at the last minute that we found out how to use all these new technologies for better purposes than just killing time.</p>

        <p>What chilled me to the bone was when she said:</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>My biggest concern is all the people who do not live in our city</strong>. Those we lost on the way. Those who decided that it became too much, all this  technology. Those who felt obsolete and useless when robots and AI took  over big parts of our jobs. Those who got upset with the political  system and turned against it. They live different kind of lives outside  of the city. Some have formed little self-supplying communities. Others  just stayed in the empty and abandoned houses in small 19th century  villages</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<p>&rt;  Shopping? I can't really remember what that is. For most of us, it has  been turned into choosing things to use. Sometimes I find this fun, and  sometimes I just want the algorithm to do it for me. <strong>It knows my taste  better than I do by now.</strong> </p>
<p>And how I don't know how I'm supposed to feel about this:</p>
<p>&rt;Once in awhile I get annoyed about the fact that I have no real privacy.  No where I can go and not be registered. I know that, somewhere,  everything I do, think and dream of is recorded. I just hope that nobody  will use it against me.</p>
<p>Oh so I'm supposed to feel comfortable now. After all the WEF understands our concerns, so it's okay.</p>

        <p>I love the part about the ones who got left behind. It's the only part that doesn't freak me out. I will gladly stay in an abandoned house and forage for roots if I don't have to participate in happytalism.</p>

        <p>How is an algorithm supposed to determine your tastes in a world stripped of choice outside the algorithm?   I've heard that the tech companies in our dystopian future  are supposed to continue to profit by selling and collecting all our personal information, but at the same time they are working to homogenize us into grey skinned generic NPC drones.  In the dystopia, how is the personal information of everyone is of economic value when everyone will be same because of years of brainwashing from the algorithm?</p>

        <p>Before people say "Gee, this sounds like a nice world to live in", I'm going to write an addedum to this article, which incorporates a lot of the "New Normal" into what our current future will look like:</p>
<p>&rt; At this point, I don't have to worry about illness slowing me down, because Joe, my assigned contact tracer and medical concierge, comes over every week to check me for COVID-19 and other communicable diseases that might put me or my fellow man in danger. Joe alerts me when I've come into contact with someone else who is potentially ill, which prompts me to self isolate for two weeks. I am okay with this because it is my duty to protect others from my illness even when I have no symptoms displayed. You can never be <em>too</em> safe!</p>
<p>&rt; Masks are now normalized, and worn at all times. It's very convenient because now I don't have to worry about imperfections on my face or being forced into smiling or needing to read others' facial expressions. Life is much more nice this way. All our faces look the same, and we are now more equal than we ever were before. </p>
<p>&rt; During my leisure time, I choose to sit and contemplate how I can help my government. With the erasure of entertainment venues, and shopping, and other time wasters, I can now devote myself to my fellow man, and complete tasks to benefit the government. I'll volunteer my time to contact Joe if I hear my neighbor cough, or if another citizen isn't devoting their time fully to the government. Why couldn't people a decade ago dedicate their lives to bettering the world, and our One World government? Life would have been perfect back then if everyone had just submitted to this ideal world.</p>

<p>I've seen people say they would want to live in a world where we have no privacy, and devote ourselves to a "higher calling" like the government. These people either don't understand the gravity of making such a claim, or they are so mindless that they prefer living a life the government dictates for them.</p>

        <p>Pure fantasy.  Renewable energy will not provide enough energy to power a modern industrialized civilization.  Constant rolling blackouts, massive shortage of the very basics needed to support human life, widespread famine and mass death are what we are going to get.  </p>
<p>Basically we will see a repeat of the Holodomor.   Think China's failed Great Leap Forward.   Think of Pol Pot's Cambodia.  This is what we will see.</p>

        <p>Oh yeah, I remember this article.  I was wondering how they were going to manifest this dystopian vision so quickly.</p>
<p>&rt; because we could call a driverless vehicle or a flying car for longer journeys within minutes. </p>
<p>I grew up in the 70s, when people really believed that by the 21st Century we would all have flying cars.  We believed in techno-utopia.  Of course now it's obvious how much of that was a marketing scam to sell us the technocratic dystopia we currently live in.  So it's kind of funny to see "flying cars" resurrected to sell us on an even more dystopian vision that is apparently just 10 years away.</p>
<p>&rt; The air is clean, the water is clean and nobody would dare to touch the protected areas of nature because they constitute such value to our well being.</p>
<p>Translation:  you'll never leave the city.</p>
<p>&rt; When AI and robots took over so much of our work, we suddenly had time to eat well, sleep well and spend time with other people. </p>
<p>Oh, yeah, I also remember how we were all going to live lives of leisure once robots did all the heavy lifting.  Funny how they never mentioned redundancy and mass unemployment.  Maybe UBI will fix it.</p>
<p>&rt; My biggest concern is all the people who do not live in our city. Those we lost on the way. Those who decided that it became too much, all this technology. Those who felt obsolete and useless when robots and AI took over big parts of our jobs. Those who got upset with the political system and turned against it. They live different kind of lives outside of the city. Some have formed little self-supplying communities. Others just stayed in the empty and abandoned houses in small 19th century villages. </p>
<p>At last, a ray of hope in this terrifying vision of the future.</p>

        <p>This is sickening. I hate so much that people are so easily divided over so many nonsense issues while actual villains unravel their evil plans under which we will all suffer.</p>
