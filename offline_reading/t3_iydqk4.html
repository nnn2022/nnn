        <p>At my apartment complex, there are two pools and a gym. They didn’t open them back up until about two months ago, but each time you want to use one of the facilities (which are only open during business hours) you have to go to the office to sign a bunch of waivers and turn in your ID while using the pool or gym. They also closed one of the two pools to “enforce social distancing”. Additionally, have to use a mask when not in the pool or not on the gym equipment.</p>
<p>Nothing says “preventing the spread” like creating more unnecessary person-to-person contact and cramming them into a tighter space. Also, when they went to go unlock the (tiny) gym for me, they told me I need to be wearing a mask. I said “really?”, and they said “oh, well just from the time you come in the door to when you get on the equipment”... I said “that’s a whole five seconds. Really?”</p>

        <p>The creation of excess and unnecessary person to person contact is the most hilarious aspect of all of these rules. Instead of avoiding the vicinity of others when entering my work building through a side door I have to be funneled through one door and check in with several people I would otherwise not encounter. </p>
<p>It’s all liability, not safety. But people point to these restrictions and use them to validate their belief that some super dangerous pandemic is going on. It’s become a self fulfilling prophecy. “Look at all these new rules we have to follow, surely there’s a reason, it must be because this is dangerous, let’s put more rules into place, oh, look at all these new rules we have to follow...”</p>

        <p>Ive heard a lot of.people say, when they encounter the screener and have thwir temperature checked, that the thermometers are unreliable and commonly read 95 degrees, which is the cutoff for hypothermia. "You're healthy, proceed."</p>

        <p>I had mine taken at the doctor's office (unrelated issue) that clocked me at 100 degrees after I had been driving in my hot car for a half hour. I explained to them that it was probably from being in my car and they let me through with no problems. My temperature was normal later.</p>

        <p>Because masks are supposed to be the safeguard against all dangers in life. If one person didn’t wear a mask on the bus, we’d all die. Doesn’t have to be a medical-grade mask, just anything that fits on your face.</p>

        <p>Oh I think I've got this one:</p>
<p>Back in June my wife went to look up the 2019 most popular names on the Social Security website and it had a special notice on that page that stated: </p>
<p>&rt;In honor of those who have lost their lives to Covid-19 we are not publishing the most popular names this year.</p>
<p>They finally published the list a couple of weeks ago. In what pants-on-head universe does the deaths from covid have anything to do with releasing the data from last year's baby names?</p>

        <p>I'm from South Africa, we've had some insane regulations back in April/May, sale of open toed shoes were banned, crop bottoms had to be displayed with boots, short sleeve shirts had to be displayed with jackets. We also had tobacco and alcohol banned for about 4-5 months , interprovincial travel was banned too.</p>

        <p>Holy shit they banned alcohol? </p>
<p>Our mayor misspoke and said liquor stores would be closed and for two hours we had mass pandemonium and bum rushing of all liquor stores. The governor and mayor had to make an emergency retraction and say that liquor stores would stay open. People made shirts saying “I survived the Denver prohibition of -day- from 1-3PM” or whatever. </p>

        <p>Yeah people were mad, but nothing really happened, except the black market thriving. Also home brewing became popular for a while, I remember pineapple prices quadrupled and there was a shortage of yeast.</p>
<p>So we went to level 3 around June I think, alcohol sales were briefly allowed and then a week later banned , and then in level 2 from August alcohol shops were allowed to trade Mon-Thurs from 9-5 pm, but alcohol can be served at restaurants till 10 pm. Last week we moved to level one restrictions and alcohol can now trade on Fridays too and can be served in restaurants till the curfew at midnight.</p>

        <p>I work in a 10 story building. No stair use allowed unless you’re going down to the first floor. So instead of letting people move between floors in the stair wells they have to jam onto elevators to do so. It makes more sense to me to let people spread out and use the stairs.</p>
<p>Also at my job they removed outdoor eating tables after also removing break room chairs and told people if the weather is nice they should eat lunch outside. The outdoor tables have since been put back but it took them a few months to put that one together.</p>
<p>Also at my job they removed break room water dispensers to fill water bottles and hot water machines. Water fountains you stick your face in are still open though.</p>

        <p>In my area the council recently started installing new water stations!! The perspex screens and stickers on the ground and temperature checks remain, yet apparently community water stations are perfectly safe! So I can't walk in a building without having my temperature checked but it's perfectly fine to get some water from the same facility hundreds of others will be using.</p>

        <p>I never understood that either. Here, early on like during the toilet paper craze, a lot of big 24-hour supermarket chains changed their hours to something like 8AM to 8PM so they could restock more. That part makes sense, but some are still doing reduced hours and claiming it’s for COVID reasons... Just doesn’t make sense since it’s only putting more people in the stores at once.</p>

        <p>Here in the US some states stop serving alcohol or close bars at certain times to prevent “gathering” or claim that people tend to not social distance when they’re drunk. It’s like the officials don’t realize you can get drunk and not social distance at 6 pm. Or that college students won’t just have house parties instead where they “gather.” In my state alcohol sales have to stop at 11 and you have to be done with your drink by midnight.</p>

        <p>In the city of São Paulo, restaurants can open for indoor dining, but not outdoor dining. In the city of New York, it's the opposite. Both are following science, of course.</p>
<p>In the begging of reopening, the city of Rio de Janeiro allowed beaches to open for swimming, but not for activities on the sand. The state of Rio dr Janeiro, allowed beaches to open for activities on the sand, but not for swimming. Both were, of course, following science.</p>
<p>Edit (remembered more things):</p>
<p>The time that businesses are allowed to open is being shortened, for more social distancing. The time that the polling stations will stay open in election day im Brazil are being extended, for more social distancing.</p>
<p>In the city of Rio, the number of public busses in circulation was cut and you were only allowed in a bus if there was a seat, you could not ride standing up. This caused huge, miles long lines in bus stations, where people were closer together than on a bus, and also for much much longer than on a bus.</p>
<p>In peru, they prohibited leaving the house on sundays with very few exceptions. Not even going to the supermerket was allowed. Thousands of people were arrested on the first day this was implemented.</p>
<p>Also in Peru, men and women could not leave the house on the same weekdays. Nationwide, only men were allowed to leave the house in mondays, wednesdays and fridays; while women could only leave the house on tuesdays, thursdays and saturdays. How anyone can think this can have any effect in stopping a virus is beyond me.</p>
<p>In lots of brazilian cities, parking lots are required by law to close every other parking space, because cars need to social distance now too, apparently.</p>

        <p>When ordering food at the farmer's market, the vendor will place the food in a plastic bin, and the customer will take the food out of the plastic bin. I've also seen this done with credit cards at drive through restaurants. Also, the cashiers at some grocery stores are not bagging your groceries if you bring reusable bags because they aren't allowed to touch them.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thought of a few more. In some elevators, they have little squares marked by tape in each corner where you're supposed to stand and face the wall instead of facing forward. How could I also forget the one way down the grocery aisle thing? And the plexiglass cages for children in school?</p>
<p>All of it. All of it is fucking stupid.</p>

        <p>I’ve seen this too. I bring my reusable bags every time I go to the grocery store, and the employees “aren’t allowed to touch the bags.” That’s so stupid! Do they don’t realize that there are germs on all the items in the store, and the ones that I just touched myself?.. I’ve even been to a few where they wouldn’t let me bag my own groceries in my own bags. They made me use the store paper bags.</p>

        <p>Not allowed to visit other tables in a restaurant. Who goes up to tables of strangers and just starts talking to them? And if my friend, A, comes in to eat when I’m there with my family why can I not go talk to her? </p>
<p>One restaurant had a rule that only quarantined groups could sit together. It’s a joke. I could walk in with my friend B, tell the hostess or whoever that we quarantined together, and they would likely just say OK. </p>
<p>An ice cream place was putting your order on the counter for you to pick up instead of handing it to you. This was to “minimize contact.” The employee has already touched the cup or cone and it takes them one second to hand it to you. What does this accomplish?</p>

        <p>My favorite was the beach closures around Memorial Day and how the virus acts completely differently depending on what coast you are on. In California, you were allowed to be in the water swimming or surfing and could cross the beach to get in the water but not sit on the beach. The same week Garcetti in LA tried to explain this like it made sense, Bill DeBlasio in NYC said he would personally "pull swimmers out of the water" if they dared get in, since they were only allowed to sit on the beach, not to engage in water recreation.</p>

        <p>This metro park I used to hike at quite often will try to micromanage your directions and also took away a porch swing, which overlooks a beautiful meadow, but apparently none of the benches, because... swings are more germy than a stationary bench I guess.</p>

        <p>I saw a few days ago on the local news that some restaurants are thinking of ways to continue outdoor dinning during winter(I live in the midwest, nobody wants to eat outside in winter.) One idea was basically setting up little completely enclosed rooms outside the restaurant. Which is basically the same as eating inside except your in your own little pod I guess. Another I saw was one restaurant that is setting up outdoor heaters and some fencing around tables which I assume is to help block wind. I imagine that will maybe last them till mid fall here before it will get too cold for people to want to dine outside.</p>

        <p>Similar rules for athletics in my area..they finally let some HS teams do conditioning in “groups of no more than 8”.  The funniest thing is they all do impromptu practices, and/or play travel or club on the side...together..where none of these rules are enforced! And everyone knows that. But for school- noooo “groups of 8, paranoia paranoia” so stupid</p>

        <p>Haha yea I’ve seen this one too. Another one at a coffee shop was they took away the self-serve sugars and creamers stand, so you had to go ask the baristas for some of what you needed, which they’d then hand to you in a little plastic container which everyone else who did the same thing had touched.</p>
