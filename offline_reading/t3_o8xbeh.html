    <strong>Personal story</strong>
    <p><p>Throughout these last 15 months I have not personally known anyone who has died from this deadly infectious virus. One very very very distant family member died during and was 'positive' but was riddled with other issues and was very old. </p>
<p>I do know a few people who have had some pretty bad reactions to the vaccine but it's so important to get everyone filled up with this experimental juice. Because long covid is 100% true and these mutations are so fucking deadly. We need to give our cells the instructions to produce a spike protein in order to protect us all. </p>
<p>Although the spike protein is the thing that assists in making us sick we need to produce it internally so we can get through this pandemic of epic proportions. </p>
<p>We're litterally all fucked if we don't put a needle in our arms and trust the science. </p>
<p>I'm going to pay off a local Vax administrator so I can have all the different shots so I will never fall ill to this deadly virus that's affected no one I personally know.</p></p>

        <p>4sure, $cience will save us. All hail the vax. Saviour of mankind. If not for Pfizer, society would have collapsed. Really we owe them everything. I think its okay we sacrifice a few of our own for the almighty God Pfizer.</p>

        <p>Those are most likely bots pushing propaganda and trying to program people to think like this, remember most of the people in the world are not on social media, social media is the minority in how people “feel” in the world - don’t listen to this utter garbage low level propaganda its either propaganda bots or a couple of losers on reddit, this is not how most people feel!</p>

        <p>remember too, those that "died from covid" likely didn't.  I was off work for awhile and had heard that a coworkers wife died from covid - awful, right?  well when I got back to work and asked him about it, turns out that she absolutely did not die from covid - went to hospital due to a completely separate issue, happened to test positive for covid and died - counted as a covid death though.</p>
