    <strong>Useful information for employees and in general for people in the UK</strong>
    <p><p>The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development put out advice for employers, the <a href="https://www.cipd.co.uk/Export/ToPdf?path=%252fknowledge%252ffundamentals%252femp-law%252fhealth-safety%252fpreparing-for-covid-19-vaccination">PDF document can be found here</a></p>
<p>Interesting sections are:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Employees who refuse the vaccine</strong></p>
<p>Employees may refuse vaccines for many reasons, ranging from concerns about potential allergy, a phobia of needles or misplaced concerns about fertility. There is also misinformation around vaccines including disbelief about the rigorousness of the approval process, which could lead to concerns or refusal. </p>
<p>Whatever reason an employee has for refusing to be vaccinated, employers must consider each case individually, taking into account the issues outlined below. Some of the concerns people may have could reflect deeply held views or feelings of apprehension, and these are taking place against a backdrop of heightened levels of fear and anxiety due to the pandemic and the challenging circumstances many are experiencing.</p>
<p><strong>Refusal due to philosophical belief</strong></p>
<p>Some employees have an anti-vaccination belief. They could argue this is a protected philosophical belief under the Equality Act 2010. For example, an employee who believes in natural medicine only could try to establish that this belief is genuinely held and worthy of respect, which could lead to a claim that would need to be evaluated by a tribunal if progressed. An employer could argue that an anti-vax belief is not a philosophical belief protected by the Equality Act, because there is an inadequately coherent belief system behind it. Whilst there are legal subtleties surrounding whether the 'anti-vax' movement would attract Equality Act protection there is at the very least a risk that this type of belief could be protected and lead to compensation.</p>
<p>Similar claims may arise from vegans who may also be protected under the Equality Act if a vaccine includes animal products. The COVID-19 vaccines do not contain any products derived from animals so this should be made clear to employees.</p>
<p>Employers should discuss someone’s concerns and objections and take them seriously, by listening to their reasons for refusing vaccination and, if necessary, exploring other COVID-19 secure ways of working.</p>
<p><strong>Refusal due to religious belief</strong></p>
<p>Some employees may refuse to be vaccinated on the basis of their religious beliefs. Religious beliefs do not have to be shared by everybody within that religion. For example, the belief of some Christians that a cross should be worn as a symbol of your faith does not have to be held by everyone. Therefore, an anti- vaccination belief could be held by some people of a certain faith and potentially be protected, even though others of the same faith are in favour of vaccination. Employers will have to take each case on its merits and listen to an employee’s reasons for refusing vaccination and if necessary explore other COVID-19 secure ways of working.</p>
<p>Although pork gelatine is historically used in some vaccines, which could lead to refusal on the grounds of religious belief for people of Muslim, Jewish or Hindu faith, the COVID19 vaccines being used in the UK do not use pork gelatine. In fact, the UK COVID-19 vaccine rollout is endorsed by the British Islamic Medical Association, Hindu Council UK, and the Board of Deputies of British Jews. Full information on the ingredients of the Oxford-Astrazeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and other vaccines can be found on their websites and patient information leaflets. This information can be used to discuss any objections based on religious beliefs. </p>
<p>Other religious groups with an objection to vaccines include religions that rely on faith healing including some Christian churches. Some Amish may be reluctant to vaccinate. Employers should listen to any reasons for refusing vaccination and, where needed, consider other COVID-19 secure ways of working.</p>
<p><strong>Options if staff refuse vaccination</strong></p>
<p>If staff refuse vaccination employers should seriously consider the employee’s reasons and any <br>
 concerns they may have, and look to implement alternative solutions, while relevant. This could include continued working from home if possible, social distancing within the workplace, screens, the use of PPE and so on. The employer may be willing to consider changing the employee’s work responsibilities or role if this could enable them to work remotely or in a safer working environment.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if their return to the workplace could pose a threat to the wider workforce's health and safety, employers may consider not allowing unvaccinated employees to return to the workplace. This entails a legal risk for the employer. Indirectly pressurising employees to be vaccinated (such as with disciplinary action) are likely to result in claims and will be less successful, ultimately, than the encouragement approach of sharing  educational factual information. </p>
<p>In some sectors though, such as health and care work, vaccination is of even greater importance so employers may consider a dismissal process as a last resort, especially if they are unable to find alternative work for individuals who refuse vaccination and other efforts at encouraging employees to be vaccinated are unsuccessful. </p>
<p><strong>Making vaccination mandatory</strong></p>
<p>An announcement is expected from the government shortly that COVID-19 vaccination will be made compulsory for those working in care homes in England with elderly and vulnerable people. A further review will decide whether this policy will be extended to other parts of the adult and social care sectors, including extending the policy to all hospital staff. It appears that workers who can prove they are medically exempt will not be required to have the vaccination and that care workers are likely to have 16 weeks to decide to take up the offer of vaccination. </p>
<p>In addition to the care home development, some employers in other sectors are choosing to make vaccination mandatory for their workforce. For example, Pimlico (formerly Pimlico Plumbers) is introducing a ‘no jab, no job’ policy and engaging only new starters who have been vaccinated against COVID-19 and offering to pay for all staff to have the vaccination once it becomes privately available. </p>
<p>There are a number of issues to consider with regards to mandatory vaccination, which are discussed below. Mandatory vaccination is an intrusion on an employee’s body and may discriminate on the basis of disability, or religious or philosophical belief. Employers cannot forcibly vaccinate employees or potential employees, unless they work in a sector (such as care homes) where a legal requirement is introduced. As we await further government guidance on this it is important to bear in mind how the law stands at the moment: </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>Enforced vaccination would be a criminal offence against the person and an unlawful injury leading to claims such as assault and battery. </li>
<li>The Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 specifically states that members of the public should not be compelled to undergo any mandatory medical treatment, including vaccinations. </li>
<li>As the government are about to insist on compulsory vaccination, there is a potential human rights issues as Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights protects people from being interfered with physically or psychologically (which includes mandatory vaccination) </li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand: </p>
<ul>
<li>COVID-19 is a reportable disease under RIDDOR and having the vaccination can be a © Copyright Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development 2021, 151 The Broadway, London SW19 1JQ, UK Incorporated by Royal Charter, Registered Charity no. 1079797 123 Page 9 of 16   means of protection of other staff or, for example, patients in a health or social care setting. </li>
<li>The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 requires the employer to take all reasonably practicable steps to reduce workplace risks to their lowest practicable level. </li>
<li>All employers have well established duties of care to protect employees in both contract and tort law. </li>
</ul>
<p>The new legal development is the nature of the requirement for vaccination, through the Health and Social Care legislation requiring care homes to assess the risk of, and prevent, detect and control the spread of infections. The Code of Practice on Infection Prevention and Control will also be amended. By way of comparison, some NHS frontline healthcare workers have previously been required or recommended to have vaccines including for example hepatitis B and flu for certain healthcare workers but this is applied through workplace health and safety and occupational health policies. </p>
<p>Vaccination requires an individual’s informed and voluntary consent and cannot be forced. If employees refuse vaccination, to discharge their health and safety duty, the employer may need to consider other steps that can be taken to protect them. An employer could consider potential disciplinary proceedings for failure to follow a reasonable instruction in certain settings (such as health or care) where an employees’ refusal has serious consequences but this approach is not without risk (as outlined below). Any employers considering this approach should follow the government guidance once this emerges and seek specific legal advice if necessary.</p></p>
