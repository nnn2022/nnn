    <strong>Tales from a former media-hated hotspot</strong>
    <p><p>I write to you from Arizona, where the governor has a R behind his name so the media thinks we all perished in a ball of Covid with our 5000 person death count (and believe me our health department mined the fuck out of death certificates so I’m guessing our death count is more like an honest 2-3k rather than 5k). </p>
<p>Currently all of our metrics are April/May levels which means it’s basically non existent in the community. People are getting it at the universities but it’s not spreading in the community basically at all. </p>
<p>Life looks basically 2019 levels of life and activity. Everything is open albeit with occupancy restrictions. Bars, clubs, restaurants, water parks, movie theaters, entertainment spots like Main Event &amp; Top Golf, churches, gyms...all open. Youth sports and adult league sports all taking place, many games with fans. Office parking lots suggest maybe 75% of people have gone back into work. Traffic also reflects that. Schools are being given the green light to go back in 5 days a week with minimal precautions.</p>
<p>The only thing Arizona closed during our worst cases were bars, theaters, gyms, river tubing and water parks. Nothing else closed. Private gatherings weren’t monitored or restricted. Funerals and weddings happened unrestricted. </p>
<p>Hospitals never reached surge capacity. Not a single patient had any sort of rationed care. No covid patient was ever denied any treatment. Hospitals never overflowed. Media tried so hard to make it seem like they would and I’ll never understand it. The media panicked whole ordinary citizens lived their lives. Only 3.6% unemployment on top of the 3% we already were at in February. That 3.6% represents mostly entertainment venue employees and some white collar jobs. I’ve been head hunted for jobs more during this than I was before. Our economy was never thrown out of the equation when trying to manage our epidemic and Arizona is stronger for it. People’s mental health is better. </p>
<p>Our numbers spiked in May due to our hot season setting in. Everyone went into the AC and covid spread from there. Considering private gatherings weren’t mediated whatsoever, I doubt the few restrictions did much. Everyone partied at home for 2 months and packed dozens of people into single family homes where it spread from there. We also had the added bonus of our border counties taking American citizens as patients from across the border in Mexico. That raised our numbers considerably as well.</p>
<p>I guess all this is to say that an epidemic of Covid can be handled without insane mitigation. Would I have attended a 500 person indoor concert in late June? Probably but I also would’ve accepted the considerably high risk of doing so. Ultimately I don’t begrudge shit like that still being off the table considering even Sweden had larger crowd restrictions. But looking at NYC with less than 1% positivity refusing to reopen indoor dining while AZ has had indoor dining since May 15th even at our peak, it’s hard to say if I would’ve wanted to be anywhere else. I felt like I had control over my life and my movements and the gatherings I took part in the whole time. Being able to have game nights and pool parties kept a lot of us sane. I don’t envy places with such harder restrictions when we know it’s possible to get through the epidemic curve without such restrictions.</p>
<p>Now we move into our no AC, everyone does everything outside time of year until May and I’m excited. I doubt we will have anymore issues. It feels really good to have proven the media wrong.</p></p>

        <p>I’m seeing places switch their signs from “mandatory” to “preferred” and seeing less masks in public in general. Went to brunch last weekend and noticed a few people coming and going without masks in the restaurant. It’s not militant here like it is in some places at least.</p>

        <p>Everyone I spoke to said that Arizona was going to hell. I knew not to trust the media but I didn't have any other sources of info on the state. Until now. Thanks.</p>

        <p>I would say over 50% of people are in the office and it’s gradually increasing. They haven’t traced cases back to offices in much capacity at all and if they have, people have worked from home for 10-14 days then gone back in. I see more and more office parking lots filling in each week.</p>
