    <strong>Here is what will happen next</strong>
    <p><p>Now - </p>
<p>Biden will install mask mandates where ever he has the jurisdiction. Everything will open up steadily as the segment of the population that is willing is vaccinated. I imagine the vaccinated population will reach anywhere from 30-55%. </p>
<p>Spring/Summer 2021 - </p>
<p>At that point, the attention will focus to those who are skeptical of taking the vaccine. The UK variant, which we have been told has a significantly higher transmission rate will come to the forefront. People who "re-joined" society and didn't continue to wear their masks during the reopening will be vilified as the cause of the virus' resurgence and Biden's mask mandate will be widely implemented by governors. People who have already received their vaccination will become increasingly anxious, impatient and more vocal about their disdain towards those who haven't been vaccinated "holding them back" from "returning to normal". Acceptance towards a method of documenting and verifying who has received a vaccine (who received what vaccine and when) will increase and the rollout of vaccination passport apps is started. Passports will only be required for international travel. People that received the first vaccines may be recommended to receive a 3rd shot as a "booster" to their immunity.</p>
<p>Winter 2021/Start of 2022</p>
<p>Social and employer pressure force people hesitant regarding the safety of the vaccinations begin to take their toll and more and more succumb to the external forces, receiving the vaccination. Total population vaccinated reaches anywhere from 70-85%. The vaccine passport will begin to transform from being required only for overseas travel to being required to perform every day activities - entrance to government facilities, hospitals, perhaps banks and big box retailers. Those who continue to refuse the vaccine will lose their jobs and day to day activities will be increasingly harder to accomplish.</p>
<p>Mid 2022</p>
<p>We are told that the applications aren't secure in the hands of private corporations and should be centralized. WHO or the UN will be the organization that is tasked with the aggregation of the data. The idea is floated that an application isn't the best form of verification - a physical method would be more secure and unique to each individual. The media will even discuss that "conspiracy theorists are calling the physical passport the biblical Mark of the Beast, however it is your only path back to normalcy". As "herd immunity" has been achieved, the focus will shift to adding the covid vaccination to the regime that newborns receive. As newborn children do not have electronic devices, the physical certification will be necessary. After which, the application will be phased out and those who wish to continue will accept the physical mark. Incentives will be provided to persuade people to accepting - debt forgiveness mainly.</p>
<p>This is how I see the next 18 months unfolding. That's about the amount of time I see we have until the end. I hope I'm wrong and I'm open to criticism and adjustments regarding my timeline. God bless you all.</p></p>

        <p>What scares me is how quickly they've gotten the people to comply with the testing and tracing, especially with through the universities, major corporations, film industry, government/military and to travel to just about anywhere. That for me is a big red flag that if people can be made to undergo a test to see if they have a virus they're not even aware of having for their job or education with minimal complaints and legal action, if their workplace/college requires the vaccine, they will likely submit. I've even heard people on here say if their job requires it they don't know what they'll do.  </p>
<p>Also my fear is they can say if someone's tested positive in the past for covid-19 they're more susceptible to some new strain so they need to get vaccinated again. We need broad legal action and mass civil disobedience or I fear what you say will come to pass.</p>

        <p>My Dad doesn't even buy into the bullshit, yet wears a mask everywhere just to blend in. It's really embarrassing, honestly. Last night I even said "maybe one day people will just stop complying", to which he replied "I hope so". It didn't occur to him I was talking about him. People who see through the bullshit have a responsibility to stand against the orders. Anything less is treason, in my opinion. Sorry, Dad.</p>

        <p>My mother is on calls regarding CDC guidance. Last week they stated that masks mitigate but do not prevent. So if two people are in the same space wearing masks and one has covid, the other has covid.</p>
<p>She's telling me this as we are on our way to dinner. I haven't been wearing my mask in 21 and told her that I won't be wearing it while we wait for a table just to sit down for 2 hours without it on. She stormed out and left me, blaming me the whole way.</p>
<p>Stay strong, people are looking to others for strength within themselves.</p>

        <p>Good God. I'm proud of you, internet stranger, for sticking to your values. I'm staying strong as best I can. Thank you for your kind words. You do the same. 
I like your username a lot, I find myself echoing that very sentiment almost daily. 
This covid event really separated the proverbial men from the boys, the women from the girls, the intelligent from the idiots. I know we're called morons all the time for our take on this, but I guarantee you that when all that tea went into the harbor, a good portion of society called them dumb for wasting all that valuable tea. We will be looked at kindly by history.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry to hear that. I'm no Bible thumper, but there's a passage somewhere in it about how the last days will turn father against son, brother against sister, etc. This is literally doing exactly that.

<p>It really pisses me off to see people on here say this. After everything we've been put through, and all the lies, and all the rights they've trampled on, these idiots still think this is all about an election. They believe we're going to be normal by spring or summer, and we'll be back to 2019 status quo, and no vaccine passports or mandates will happen. </p>
<p>It's just delusional, pure and simple.</p>
