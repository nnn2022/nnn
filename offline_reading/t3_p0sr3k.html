    <strong>The vile tactics political tyrants make use of to steal your weapons and leave you at the mercy of the criminals on the street and the criminals that make up the state.</strong>
    <p><p>Political tyrants almost always take guns away from the people of a given nation in order to make them more state-dependant and leave them defenceless against common criminals and of course against the government itself. It is a vicious cycle and must be avoided at all costs, for once it begins they will then use every instance of criminals illegally using guns for crime against the now defenceless population as reason for more and more restrictions on what weapons you can legally own, which will only leave the population more and more defenceless and lead to more and more tragedies, which will then be weaponized by the state and the propaganda arm of the state, (the media), for the express purpose of further stealing your liberties and eventually completely eliminating your ability to defend yourself from crime and tyranny altogether.</p>
<p>Never, ever, ever give up your guns. Never give up any rights regarding your ability to own and carry weapons. Taking away weapons and outlawing the ability to carry them is a hallmark trait of tyrants and authoritarians, their end goal is the theft of your personal freedom and safety. </p>
<p>You have been warned, avoid falling for this rhetoric at all costs. As a Canadian, who has had to sit by and watch his fellow Canadians blindly give their freedoms away for the cheap price of deceptive political rhetoric, don’t make the mistakes they have. Our country has become a totalitarian mess and it wouldn’t have been possible if the Canadian population had not become so ignorant, naïve and historically illiterate.</p>
<p>True Canadian freedom fighters such as myself will not allow this country to fall prey to tyranny however, we shall once again become the true North, strong and free. Regardless, heed my warning or you will suffer the consequences.</p></p>
