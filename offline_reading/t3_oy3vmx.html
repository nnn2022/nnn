        <p>You're right. The hundreds of thousands dead in the US is a conspiracy. The entire medical and scientific communities have come together to manipulate the numbers along with national governments the world over. Thousands of experts and politicians all working together..
And people like you see through it all. Because you're special and know more than experts. The vast majority that adhere to lockdowns or mask mandates and are willing to at least consider a vaccine are all sheep. And the special few that see through all the lies are busy sorcing information from memes and crying tyranny because they are told to wear a mask.</p>

        <p>Personally I believe that there is a virus out there, and it is killing people. Disproportionately elders and precasting condition folk, don’t try and scare me into “anybody can die from this.”</p>
<p>The problem isn’t that the true “experts” aren’t doing hard work and trying to figure out what’s going on. I’m sure the books aren’t cooked by their own rules (a death within 30 days of a positive test = covid death)</p>
<p>The problem is the governments using this “emergency” for political gain and power. The government has no right to shut down mom and pop shops all while allowing Amazon and Walmart to operate. They had no business paying people thousands a week of taxpayer money to not go to work. They have no right to require businesses to deny those who can’t show proof of vaccination. The experts are trying their best to stop the spread of disease yes, but it’s not the only factor at play here.</p>
<p>Personally? I don’t think masks or lockdowns helped a damn bit in the grand scheme of things. It definitely delayed some people from catching the virus, but those people eventually caught it. If masks and lockdowns work, why didn’t they?</p>

        <p>It doesn't take a genius to understand the value of masks. Ever been to a hospital? Triage? Etc. They don't wear masks as a fashion statement. Its also as much about protecting others than yourself. I've been in several hotspots (delta variant, much more infectious) and haven't tested positive. I wore a mask but maybe just a coincidence... the argument of personal freedoms over something as trivial as wearing a mask is laughable.</p>
<p>Lockdowns. I understand you're argument. I even agree to an extent. The lockdowns are a measure to prevent hospitals being overwhelmed with outbreaks. The lockdowns affect real people in a real way especially small business owners. Its not fair that big business thrives while the average person suffers. But this isn't new. Big business gets corporate hand outs while the working and middle class get raped. This was happening long before Covid, while some suggest this is all a ploy to kill.off the working class...it could also simply be a governments response to a pandemic.</p>
<p>Are lockdowns a greater restriction on peoples lives than leaving everything opened? At face value of course they are. </p>
<p>However, no lockdowns leads to hospitals being overwhelmed as outbreaks are.nonlonger contained. Meaning every health issue becomes more dangerous as hospitals are unable to treat illnesses they previously could have. See them burning bodies in the streets in India? Or Spain using ice rinks as temporary body storage once their healthcare systems were overburdened.</p>
<p>You might believe that the deaths from Covid are an unfortunate price to pay for freedom....
Or you might feel that certain actions and restrictions are worth adhering to, in order to protect your fellow countrymen and maybe yourself from a potentially life threatening virus... </p>
<p>I respect you're argument. Nothing you've said is misleading and I guess our difference of opinion comes down to the question asked above. </p>
<p>Are lockdowns a greater restriction on peoples lives than leaving everything opened? 
At the end of the day there is so much misinformation and ridiculous contrarian stances people take on this issue, this sub is fullnof it and reasonable people with genuine questions and concerns get drowned out by the insanity of NWO tin hat brigades.</p>

        <p>Sorry you got super downvoted, people can be quite hostile here if you don’t regurgitate exactly what they want to hear.</p>
<p>I get it, and I hear you. I’ve heard the arguments over and over of why this is a serious issue and why the measures were justified. I disagree with you, and that’s okay. Thank you for being civil.</p>
<p>The one thing I would say about masks: if used correctly, all the time, yes they would help. The problem is most people fish out a cloth mask out of their cup holder in their car that they haven’t washed in a month to enter a store. Surgical masks, in a medical setting normally, are disposed of after one use. This is the biggest difference I need to point out when people say masks absolutely work. They do to a certain degree, if you use them properly all the time. That’s not even what I get from the pro-mask folk. It doesn’t matter what’s over your face as long as there’s fabric over it.</p>
<p>Personally I believe that the measures taken were rash and panicked. Unnecessary at best and tyrannical at worst. Right now every adult in the USA have had their opportunity to get a vaccine. Of all hospitalizations/deaths in the past few months, 99%+ have been unvaccinated folk. That’s their choice. If you want to go back to a normal life, it’s your choice to do so. Illness has plagued the human race from the start and while I can hope nobody gets sick, that is an unrealistic expectation. We will likely have a covid shot  every fall much in the same as we do the flu. It’s not going anywhere and we need to normalize being sick again as it’s creating an unjust response from the public as the array of diseases and illnesses out there are collectively killing much than this one single bug.</p>

        <p>Yeah buddy I'm deepstate. I'm being paid (not sure who by but I'm sure you can tell me) to argue with you. </p>
<p>You can't make comments about tinfoil hats when your'e accusing a stranger on the internet of being a paid actor... But glad to know you think I've got the chops. Next stop Hollywood. </p>
<p>I am from Australia. That is correct... I am not happy with what's going on. Our government has botched the Vaccine roll-out which has lead to further lockdowns. We would be nearing herd immunity if the vaccine roll-out was implemented as our conservative government said it would. </p>
<p>I hate being in Lockdown. But I am willing to make some sacrificices in the short term if it means protecting other vulnerable humans (elderly, people with pre-existing conditions, etc) from a potentially deadly virus. I don't think I'm some hero for this, just a decent person... or maybe that makes me a snowflake, communist... In which case fuck those vulnerable people... right? Mah freedoms mohr mpordant</p>

        <p>I'm happy to have no wind in this vacuum, chief.</p>
<p>I'm learning alot actually. My interaction with you taught me when I provide someone who genuinely thinks they know more than medical and scientific commuities around the world with a logical argument, their paranoid response is to blindly accuse me of being paid and not address anything I actually wrote let alone provide evidence as to why they think their right...</p>

        <p>Im not addressing it because you went on a tangent every time. I made a declarative statement about what you post, then accused you of being paid to do it. </p>
<p>You're not here to support mankind's effort to curb authoritarianism. You're not even open to the information that gets posted here. You are JUST here to fight and argue against our viewpoint. </p>
<p>And you're telling me you're NOT getting paid for it? Pfft, loser.</p>

        <p>Convenient. Keep fighting authoritarianism through anti vaxx and anti science rhetoric. This circle jerk for edgy contrarians is a joke. For every valid question and viewpoint on on this sub there is hundreds of intentially misleading statements gobbled up in memeform by idiots. </p>
<p>Keep fighting the power. </p>
<p>Another poster on this thread had some worthwhile opinions I don't agree with but still accept as reasonable. </p>
<p>You've said half of fuck all.</p>
