    <strong>Science, Vaccinations and the Problem of thinking Black and White.</strong>
    <p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>this subreddit is mixing a lot together. Sometimes true facts with true interpreting, sometimes the other.</p>
<p>I work in a truly academic field as bioinformatician and system biologist since years and know too good how shitty science truly can be and that scientists are out of their knowledge scope in signaling cascades and processes inside the body over more than just a few cell compartments.</p>
<p>But we are also making huge progress due to more advanced computational techniques then ever before.</p>
<p>The problems with science in its current form are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Science is money and therefore publication driven. Without interesting publications you lose money for the university i.e. for your area. And without interesting topics you don’t get peer reviewed because the journals also want to make money with interesting topics - just like clickbait makes money for journalists.</li>
<li>Covid is a very good topic to get interest and with a fast genome sequencing and annotation very easy to just publish something new. Old diseases didn’t receive that much interest and therefore we know less about older diseases like the flu and its neurological consequences in-vitro or in-silico than for covid.</li>
<li>There is a new literature review (from this month even: "Nonreplicable publications are cited more than replicable ones") which proves the fact that non-replicable but interesting articles get up to 3 times published and cited more than replicable and not so interesting articles. With non-replicable data and methods, everything of it is basically no science. (Maybe this article is a replicationception and itself is not replicable :D:D)</li>
</ol>
<p>Could extend here but that’s enough basics for science per se.</p>
<p>So all scientific results, especially the publication and interesting results have to be interpreted with this in mind. Anyway.</p>
<p>One point needs to be discussed and shows that people aren’t understanding the benefit of the vaccine.</p>
<p>Covid is for 99% a non-lethal disease which for itself doesn‘t justify the lockdowns, psychological harm and other stuff. I think they exaggerate like anxiety-driven hamsters and kids will face even more problems, for them the 2 years are core-development and they think they have to fear the environment w/o a mask.</p>
<p>The Vaccines are shit in standards of vaccines and will be upgraded when they are better. Just now they replace the spike protein against the blood clots. They won’t hold forever and have to be refreshed at sometime.</p>
<p>To vaccinate when not in the risk group seems stupid because the risk group could just vaccinate themselves, then they are fine. Same goes for all the Doomers. They can just vaccinate themselves and let the others be, then they are fine. This is a good thought and I like it but it‘s not as black and white like that.</p>
<p>While Covid is mostly non-lethal, it needs many resources of the health care system for symptomatic patients. And there is the problem. For the current healthcare system the % of people who would need serious healthcare with unhindered covid spread would be too high. Then people who fall from a ladder or have other serious daily injuries don’t have a guaranteed hospital bed anymore. In democracy they can’t say one patient is worth more than the other and just make a bed free. And that would be the point where the lethal rate spikes. Because of pneumonia treated people(covid) on intensive care, others die. That is the whole problem. While Covid isn‘t the death like what Doomers say, the collateral damage to the healthcare system would certainly be.</p>
<p>That’s the reason why vaccination is helpful. Because it significantly reduces patients who need intensive care.</p>
<p>In this sub there are also some false information about this vaccine.</p>
<p>If you have worse symptoms from the covid vaccine after having had covid without many symptoms, this doesn‘t mean the vaccine kills you. In the vaccine are other viruses to transmit the necessary mrna part from covid i.e. the spike protein. They use other viruses which are non-lethal and well-known for this. So you literally can get a cold from it but not from covid, it is the virus which they chose to insert into the vaccine - and as I said they are chosen wisely and non-lethal.</p>
<p>Allergic people can show problems in rare cases.</p>
<p>There is also a snippet of lipids in ovaries and if you look more closely - the spleen. This isn’t a problem and is totally normal. That is because the other transmitting virus causes the body to react and therefore your body values change.</p>
<p>But as I said before the vaccine is also shit, this is due to the rushed version, you don’t know all additions they use and you can’t trust capitalistic biotech firms who develop and sell for money instead of making the recipe open for humanity.</p>
<p>So it isn‘t black and white. You have to think if you want to support the healthcare system with vaccination or not. Not if you want to survive Covid with the vaccine or not. You would survive it to 99,5% without too, but would you survive the car crash without a hospital bed if they are in use?</p>
<p>The anxiety made by media is pure manipulation and money-making for the journalists because of an interesting topic and the discussion about mandatory vaccination as well as privileges for vaccinated person are below all human rights. Everybody should be free in choosing if he wants to support this society on a risk of his own health or if not. The extremely scared people from covid itself need psychological help asap that they aren‘t getting worse from all this media. Psychological damage on society has already been done and it is a pain to watch.</p>
<p>People should be able to decide themselves if they want to go outside or do a housejob which can lead to serious injuries. That’s called grown up.</p>
<p>We invest so much resources into this small sickness and forget the climate or the rising plastic waste with covid tests. Or the people who can’t afford life anymore because of bullshit like these which kills the economy for the non-billionaires. There is a lot going wrong because politicians are not making thoughtful choices for humanity but for themselves or any other pressure point.</p>
<p>Stay healthy and I hope I was able to help you understand it in a few more grey tones.</p></p>

        <p>The actual number of sick people is low in comparison with all tested ones but it is still high enough to make a meaningful difference in hospitals.
The discussion about empty hospitals is twofold:
1.  Because of the restrictions there are less people needing healthcare. There was less spread of any other disease like the flu in the last year, people didn’t party that often which leads to more car accidents due to drink and driving or motor control mistakes while impressing somebody. These are just examples to show you cases which were reduced due to restrictions.
2.  More capabilities in hospitals were made available</p>

        <p>Ah another one of the "mild dissenters". New redditors who criticise everything else apart from the vaccine. 
No matter how well informed or in the know you pretend to be, the fact still remains that no one knows what these injections are going to do to people. 
Don't be fooled by these new shills folks, they're here for vaccine promotion.</p>

        <p>Yes, and that doesn’t distort the content in any way. Do you think researcher use reddit long term? Academic jobs are full time, if you aren’t programming you have to read new papers. There is researchgate for social media. I wanted to explain you because I experience the knowledge gap in my family as an outsider „which made it“ from worker to high academic as well and always leads to conflicts. Loneliness is a side-effect</p>

        <p>The major flaw here is that the testing and reporting of cases has been grossly exaggerated using a technique we all know is unsuitable.</p>
<p>We all know the cases are not as high as reported, there are so many lies being thrown around regarding this.
Furthermore there is the fact that 6 months prior to this pandemic the World Economic Forum held a pandemic response trial... a coincidence?
What about the fact that the digital vax passes in the UK have been discovered to monitor far more than a person's vax status? It also includes their criminal records, alleged crimes, sexual orientation, religion, social factors etc etc</p>
<p>None of that is about healthcare, it is the same parameters used in China to operate their social credit system...</p>
<p>Still think it is a coincidence?</p>
<p>What about the fact that they are ready trialing universal basic income in Ireland and in Wales...</p>
<p>It is obvious where this is heading...</p>
<p>Are futures will be tied to these vax passes which will become Digital  Markers that have all of our data on them... they determine how much universal credit/social credit we get based on how compliant we are to their rules...</p>
<p>If we don't let them do what they want to us and our bodies, we don't get the credit to buy food etc.</p>

        <p>PCR Tests are the most specific and well suited tests to test for specific RNA. There are plenty of different variations developed from the original. 
The actual cases and their reporting could be flawed. This depends on your region though. The actual sick people don’t equal the infected, that is for sure. And the data is exaggerated because it causes anxiety when hearing of these high numbers. The actual number of sick people is low in comparison with all tested ones but it is still high enough to make a meaningful difference in hospitals.</p>
<p>I don’t believe in conspiracies though. But in money and corruption</p>

        <p>Sorry I don‘t answer your question. </p>
<p>But I can tell you that technically it is safer to have digital pass with state of the art encryption methods in a state with a developed IT-infrastructure and expertise than having it physically available.</p>
<p>User profiling and identification is more a problem of big companies who can sell it which can then lead with a higher probability to a data breach in smaller companies and therefore in a very rare case maybe to identity theft. This would cause you stress and paper work to gain it back. 
For a democratic state which has your „user profile“ since birth and extends it for your lifetime with insurances, taxes etc. there isn‘t a difference in terms of „storage“ but they would make its availability safer because of encryption.</p>
<p>The real problem with tracking data is about restrictions and how easy it would be to execute them because of the ease of access to the public user profile.
This is a real problem but there is no need to draw the devil on the wall and think that is the future. There are a lot of ethical questions and there is a huge range inbetween from not implementing such a 2-class society to implementing it. They are also aware of people like the original commenter who they could drive into a misanthropic psychosis.
Conspiracies are assumptions, they can happen but don’t have to. And it seems unlikely to have a global pact of evil.</p>

        <p>Giving out shots in hopes of curtailing potential future hospitalizations is ludicrous. This is what the military is for. We pay billions in taxes to have the most modern military one could ask for. If the civilian population is overwhelmed we have stockpiles of supplies and cadres of medical professionals at every level of the Armed Services. FEMA could also be called upon. There are other vast resources that could be mustered if we needed additional support for the "healthcare system". To think that the number of civilian hospital beds we have is a Zero Sum game with only a finite amount available is to ignore all the other support systems, personnel and services that could be rendered if the need arose. This argument has always been weak and why I never believed the 2 weeks to flatten the curve mantra. It's childish to think we can not support our hospitals with ancillary organizations.</p>

        <p>Yes that’s true. They can’t foresee if it really happens.
In India they made a drama but look, it wasn’t that bad. And there the health care and overpopulation both would be great for covid. Nobody knows if the so-called exponential curve even exists because it was never going beyond linear after the small hotspot onsets. This could be because of saturated tests or just because it doesn’t exist. And even then this shows infected and not only sick people.
It’s not an easy decision to preemptively go for the cautious way because of the data. But politicians have to trust the data, even if the data can be distorted. They don’t want to risk it. I personally would’ve decided to risk it, and when it does happen that it saturates the hospital beds, then decide from there for a few restrictions. But people elected people for these decisions. Sweden tried it with less restrictions and had to make more. Italy had a bad start so they just acted for the whole country like their hotspot where it was bad. In France the people didn‘t listen and it wasn‘t that bad. Germany shows how corrupt politicians are and that they only act for their own good and election results. Spain had really big problems with deaths. Social Media also manipulates politicians with anxiety pictures. Maybe the decisions against Covid were good, maybe they were too exaggerated. However, the media is the worst. And they shouldn’t focus that much on vaccines only but how to normalize peoples mindset now, after the damage has been done, for living with covid. Look how people act and say they want 0% covid… they should just get psychotherapy fast. I don’t want to wear masks forever, they are mostly useless and it also makes no sense how people were them outdoor. There are hygienic concepts which are good enough but apparently for politicians they aren’t to just open everything. Till now the cure has been worse than the disease. But we sadly don’t know for sure how bad the disease really would have been without any restrictions. The probability is high that it would have went worse because of the first available data and hotspot problems but it is just not a certainty. That’s why I understand the critics for all of this. 
Due to overpopulation and other problems of modern era, „just live with it“ would’ve been another solution.</p>
