        <p>Can confirm. Another friend of mine and I are doing our damndest to keep a married couple friend of ours off the ledge. This isn’t them and they’re under a media spell and I’ll be damned if I let them slip away. We have an incredibly close familial relationship and they haven’t judged us at any point for how lax we are but they themselves are terrified and we are doing whatever we can to keep them from falling further. I know they don’t want to live like this and I’m not giving up on them. But I’ve heard some people completely end friendships because their friends weren’t being the “right kind of cautious”. Sad as hell.</p>

        <p>They are very lucky to have you! Friendships are so important, especially in these times. And I agree that losing friends over this is incredibly sad. I feel like people who end them because of that are probably not true friends to begin with, but it sucks to find out that way.</p>

        <p>My boyfriend’s best friend stopped talking to him about it in April. Now the friend is obese (100 lbs overweight), diabetes, probably a whole slew of other health problems since he prefers to sit on his ass in his dirty-ass apartment drinking half a bottle of vodka a night (yeah, it’s bad...). So he had reason to be alarmed, but my bf and I knew back then we weren’t under any danger. The friend thought my bf was an evil grandma killer even though we weren’t going out at all then.</p>
<p>We’ve heard from others (friends, his brother), he’s lightened up on his “I’m scared of COVID” stance but he still hasn’t apologized. His brother thinks he’s beyond ridiculous</p>

        <p>The article states the obvious, but I am glad to see that my local news is starting to at least acknowledge this as a problem, and actually suggests people go see friends in person.</p>
