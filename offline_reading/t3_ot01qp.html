    <strong>This is a perpetual downwards spiral that only stops with you saying NO</strong>
    <p><p>If you haven’t realised yet this is a perpetual cycle in which they clamp down, release a little when they face resistance from the people and then clamp down harder when the resistance fades taking more and more of your rights each time and conditioning you to get used to the “new normal”.</p>
<p>Get ready for covid to keep “spreading” and for them to blame it on the unvaccinated stirring enough hate in the brainwashed to allow them to enforce mandatory vaccines, normalise bullying and harsher restrictions for the unvaccinated, introduce never ending mandatory vaccine booster shots, introduce covid detention camps, mandate more frequent and longer lockdowns, double-down on censorship of doctors and those that speak out, introduce even more ridiculous restrictions and enforce mandatory vaccine passports. All the while deaths exponentially increase from "new strains" and/or a new “deadlier” virus when it is actually the vaccine that is killing and sterilising everyone to plan as part of the globalist depopulation agenda.</p>
<p>On top of this get ready for cyber-attacks to disrupt the food and supply chains, wars, fake alien threats, climate change fear to push more restrictions, one world government (EU), economic crisis manufactured by the federal reserve, economic crisis as a result of lockdowns and restrictions, a worldwide ID with implantable microchips and finally The Great Reset under which "you will own nothing and be happy" and be completely dependent on the government with all your possessions stripped from you. </p>
<p>How can we stop this? by enough of us waking up and saying NO. This means protesting, practicing civil disobedience, refusing to get the vaccine, upholding the teachings of the bible and spreading the word. Finally, we must then hold the globalists and their enforcers to account and ensure that this never happens again in future generations.</p></p>

        <p>Good news is, people are waking up. I don’t think there’s as many people vaccinated as they say there are. We will make it through. We just need to keep doing what we’re doing and grab some others along the way and if we each play our part, we will win.</p>

        <p>I agree 100% and it's insulting that you, me, and many others see it for what it is.</p>
<p>They are good at fooling those who aren't paying attention. They cannot, on the other hand, fool those who do. Their plans are simply too sinister and large scale to be able to trick us. We know. </p>
<p>We said this shit about digital currency. We said it about search engines manipulation results. We said it about GPS on every smart phone. We said it about crisis exploitation that is so obvious it bores me.</p>
<p>Fuck them. What a pathetic life to want to control, deceive, and destroy peoples lives.</p>
