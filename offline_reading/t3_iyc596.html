    <strong>"Every day we now see patients complaining of headaches, sinus problems, respiratory problems and hyperventilation due to wearing masks" [open letter signed by 418 medical doctors, September 2020]</strong>
    <p><p>Some of you might want to use the recent information below when you write to your representatives to express your concerns about mask mandates: </p>
<p>An open letter from <a href="https://docs4opendebate.be/en/open-letter/">September 2020</a> signed by 418 medical doctors states: 
&rt;...Masks belong in contexts where contacts with proven at-risk groups or people with upper respiratory complaints take place, and in a medical context/hospital-retirement home setting. They reduce the risk of droplet infection by sneezing or coughing. Oral masks in healthy individuals are ineffective against the spread of viral infections. Wearing a mask is not without side effects. Oxygen deficiency (headache, nausea, fatigue, loss of concentration) occurs fairly quickly, an effect similar to altitude sickness. Every day we now see patients complaining of headaches, sinus problems, respiratory problems and hyperventilation due to wearing masks. In addition, the accumulated CO2 leads to a toxic acidification of the organism which affects our immunity. Some experts even warn of an increased transmission of the virus in case of inappropriate use of the mask. Our Labour Code (Codex 6) refers to a CO2 content (ventilation in workplaces) of 900 ppm, maximum 1200 ppm in special circumstances. After wearing a mask for one minute, this toxic limit is considerably exceeded to values that are three to four times higher than these maximum values. Anyone who wears a mask is therefore in an extreme poorly ventilated room. Inappropriate use of masks without a comprehensive medical cardio-pulmonary test file is therefore not recommended by recognised safety specialists for workers. Hospitals have a sterile environment in their operating rooms where staff wear masks and there is precise regulation of humidity / temperature with appropriately monitored oxygen flow to compensate for this, thus meeting strict safety standards. </p>
<p>More comprehensive view of the topic of masks [here for scientific evidence] (https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/ip5fu0/scientific_evidence_and_crosscountry_variability/) and <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/hosvhw/an_updated_critique_of_the_twopronged_idea_that_a/">here for psychological and social dimensions</a>. </p>
<p>And to cap it all, a nice quote-of-the-day, courtesy of Redditor papsmearfestival: </p>
<p>&rt;In my study of communist societies, I came to the conclusion that the purpose of communist propaganda was not to persuade or convince, not to inform, but to humiliate; and therefore, the less it corresponded to reality the better. When people are forced to remain silent when they are being told the most obvious lies, or even worse when they are forced to repeat the lies themselves, they lose once and for all their sense of probity. To assent to obvious lies is in some small way to become evil oneself. One's standing to resist anything is thus eroded, and even destroyed. A society of emasculated liars is easy to control. </p>

        <p>I frequently have panic attacks due to wearing a mask, due to this 99% of the time I don’t wear one, unless I absolutely need to go somewhere and they won’t let me in without one (like my doctors office.) I fear though when my work makes it a policy to wear a mask with our face shields, as I suspect they will, my doctor will refuse to write me a doctors note and I’ll have to find a new job that doesn’t require a mask.</p>

        <p>“...because I can’t suck it up and just wear a damn mask”.</p>
<p>I don’t know about you but I never get headaches from masks even when I wear them for a third of my day. I don’t even have any problems like acne, sinus, or any face problems when wearing a mask. My breathing is just about the same, I never really get any discomfort from a mask, and in fact I never even feel the mask if I’m not focusing on it. Most other people I am around say the same.</p>
<p>Also, most if not every source I’ve seen about masks show that masks, social distancing, isolation, etc WORKS.</p>
<p>I also hope you realize there is about 1 million covid related or just straight covid deaths. That’s about how much malaria kills yearly, and they aren’t using much protection against it! Let’s say that masks and social distancing wasn’t needed. The virus would then be horrifying! Maybe 5 million dead within the first year, and more to come! Worst case scenario It would be likely as catastrophic as the plague that ravaged Europe during the dark ages! Screw malaria, tuberculosis, cancer, all that crap! We have a monster loose!</p>
<p>All we need to do is to follow what most if not all the professionals say, and do what we are told. They are preventing a major plague just with three simple systems.</p>
<p>You have the audacity to complain about your mask even when people are on hospital beds, with their children crying as they flatline. Wow.</p>

        <p>Not every source says mask work. If you actually read these studies they say combined with "social distancing" (a nonsensical oxymoronic phrase) and frequent hand washing they "suggest" that they work. Considering the WHO's recent publication on SARS CoV2 : </p>
<p>"To date, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by this type of aerosol route has not been demonstrated; much more research is needed given the possible implications of such route of transmission."</p>
<p>It has not been demonstrated people become infected through aerosols. This is DIRECTLY from the WHO, mind you. Fauci also said it would be hard to find out with any certainty since conducting a study during a "pandemic" would be well...difficult.</p>

        <p>Here’s the thing... most sources say they at the very least help a bit. All you did is cherry pick articles and say “yep! They don’t work!” Even when I can find at least a dozen saying that they do work.</p>

        <p>I didn't cherry pick an article I gave you the TOP official source the WHO that said mask haven't been proven in the slightest to help stop transmission.</p>
<p>Most studies say the same, that at best it's wishful thinking and is more about alivating peoples anxiety about getting infection since the virus is so small that it can easily penetrate virtually all mask outside of a full on hazmat suit.</p>

        <p>Well... the top result shows... it helps. So does the next ten sources. Do you think you might have mixed up face shields for masks? Some sources say the don’t help as much but that wasn’t my point.</p>
<p>Anyway there are masks that actually protect you from far smaller threats. Things like gas masks, paint masks, and complex filtered masks can handle separating microscopic molecules and particles that pose a threat. Things like a cheap N95 respirator do their job to protect you from particles pretty well.</p>
<p>Anyway, all masks do are to make sure YOU don’t give anyone else a disease. They stop the air flow from your breaths and help keep viruses in you instead of spreading it. They don’t do well against receiving viruses but help stop spreading them. It may be you are thinking that they are meant to stop viruses from getting in but it’s the complete opposite.</p>

        <p>Your post reads like satire.</p>
<p>Over 60 million people die every year. Another few million is a drop jn the bucket, especially considering how most of those people dying from COVID were already dying from old age or other chronic/terminal illnesses. If they didn't die from the rona this year, they would've died from the flu next year, or perhaps a heart attack. It's called the harvesting effect. This wouldn't be a "major plague" even if it killed 10 million people, as the life years lost to the virus are quite minimal when you consider the average age and health of the victims.</p>

        <p>So these deaths don’t matter? All we are trying to do is to prevent deaths, and you all are stopping us from preventing deaths. </p>
<p>It may be a drop in the bucket but aren’t most causes? Cancer is a drop in the bucket, malaria, tuberculosis, the flu, HIV, you name it. The 60 million annual deaths are all composed of drops in a bucket. All the people working hard to save lives are just trying to slow the flow a bit.</p>

        <p>Bold assumption there. (You're wrong about my politics, obviously.) Also I really like your classic of calling anyone even mildly disagreeing with you a "Trump supporter" when nobody even  mentioned Trump or anything political. If you like politics so much, then go back to r/politics where you belong buddy.</p>
<p>And BTW, growing tired of wearing a mask for an indefinite amount of time with no promise of it ending anytime in the near future isn't "anti-mask", it's human instinct.</p>

        <p>Never called you a trump supporter, I said “trump supporter classic” as in a thing they do, because I’ve argued with a lot of trump supporters and they do that exact thing you did. Also don’t try to act like this isn’t a political subreddit. Although I do agree that it shouldn’t be, wearing a mask to stop infection SHOULD be basis common sense for everyone, but unfortunately selfish stupid people exist. Getting tired of wearing a mask is fine, as long as you tough through it like the rest of us. Also if it’s “human instinct” to not want to wear a mask then why do so many people do it? People have been doing it for years in other countries, and in hospitals. If it’s human instinct then so many people wouldn’t be ok with doing it.</p>

<p>And how longer do you expect the vast majority of them to endure wearing a mask when people have been told that this will end at some point, yet it goes on indefinitely with no promise for the foreseeable future? By "human instinct" I mean not people's tendency not to wear a mask; I mean with the way the goalposts are constantly shifting nowadays and with people being told repetitively to keep doing what is uncomfortable and more stress levied on them, more people will just stop wearing them because they have had enough and cannot take any more pressure.</p>

        <p>If wearing a mask is too much pressure for you than honestly just grow up. The reason we don’t have an end date set is because we don’t know when the vaccine will be done. We would be looking a lot better right now if we had all <em>wore masks</em> and stayed 6 feet apart fro the beginning. But people that don’t wear masks, <em>are the ones worsening the problem</em>. I will wear a mask until the problem is no longer a problem. Then I will take it off. Novel concept. If you’re going to complain about the goal post being changed, atleast realize you are the reason it’s changing so much.</p>

        <p>Considering in the beginning they  didn't even know how it was transmitted how could you blame people for not wearing mask? When there was the "mask shortage" did they not tell us to stop buying mask so they could be used by the first responders? Did Fauci accurately point out the virus is too small for the mask to provide protection in his 60 minutes interview? How is this on us? We're paying attention like actual adults and remember what they have been saying since the beginning unlike our detractors, such as yourself, who seem to only remember what they were last told. We see blatant contradictions and insane enforcement measures being taken, i.e. tackling someone to minimize contact/infection. Things like that defeat the purpose. It's fucking stupid and obviously so to anyone not overtaken by fear.</p>

        <p>Yeah, we definitely dont change opinions with new knowledge. At first I thought the virus was jot going to be a big deal. I said things like it’s not as bad as the flu. But then i gained new knowledge about it, and then I found out that it IS a big deal. That masks DO work, and that they’re a lot better than if you don’t wear one.</p>

        <p>From the WHO: </p>
<p>"To date, <strong>transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by this type of aerosol route has not been demonstrated</strong>; much more research is needed given the possible implications of such route of transmission."</p>
<p>Meaning they have <strong>NOT</strong> seen it transmitted through aerosols.</p>
<p>If you go to official sources they will admit in their own words that they have no idea how it is transmitted. Hell, they admit they haven't even isolated the virus itself but you actually have to <strong>READ</strong> the studies. I don't know what your reading since every official source and authority say the same thing, like they <strong><em>believe</em></strong> mask work but they have <strong><em>little supporting evidence</em></strong> and to just trust them despite the <strong><em>absence</em></strong> of that evidence.</p>

        <p>COVID is no more a problem to young healthy people than any other strain of the cold, and just like other strains of the cold, it won't be going away anytime soon. If you or a loved one are elderly or infirm, I suggest you come to terms with a higher chance of complications from ANY infectious disease. You too are selfish for expecting others to make sacrifices to protect a total stranger such as yourself.</p>

        <p>So my suspicions seem to be correct: the difficulty breathing when wearing a mask has less to do with decreased oxygen levels and more to do with increased carbon dioxide levels.</p>
<p>My husband and I haven't worn a mask for more than 2 minutes since all this shit started, until we went to Ace a couple times last week and they asked us to mask up. Rather not get kicked out of the only hardware store in town, so we pulled up our bandanas, and I was honestly surprised by how difficult it was to breathe. Mind you, my bandana is much looser and has much better airflow than the masks they'd rather us wear. Between the difficulty breathing and the impediment to my peripheral vision - I have sensory issues and I'm one of those people who consciously see their own nose between their eyes - I could barely focus on actually shopping. When I went up to the counter to pay for my purchase, I started panicking somewhat because my few social graces evidently go out the window when wearing a mask. My husband will be dealing with the cashier from now on.</p>

        <p>Did you click on the tab "Signatories" ?</p>
<p>I googled some of the names on there; all of the ones I checked appeared to be real MDs.</p>
<p>Of course it's not proof.. maybe somebody with a lot of spare time will verify just how many are real and how many fake  🙂</p>

        <p>I wanted to see if they did any fact checking or slightest quality control, If I can do that with an email address, than the entire thing is mostly faked, and most people who saw the letter should relise its mostly garbage anyways. The only people beliving it are the people here.</p>
