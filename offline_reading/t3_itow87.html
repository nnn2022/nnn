    <strong>any non-binary/trans covid skeptics?</strong>
    <p><p>to be honest, i kinda want to know if there are any lgbt people in general that are covid skeptics. i'm a non-binary and bisexual person, and to be honest i don't think covid isn't as severe as its hyped up to be. that doesn't mean i'm an anti-masker though, but i dont' think even that should be forced ono people</p></p>

        <p>Trans woman here, got a reasonably large platform on Twitter. Usually I posted on trans positivity and compassion, but slowly changing my message to see if I can create a few skeptics. Been getting a good number of 'concerned' peers who want to deprogram me because they feel I'm turning into some anti-vaxx conspiracy theorist for not towing the exact line.</p>
<p>I was already on the edge with the trans political methodology of not debating anything 'problematic' or deviating from group think. Some trans folks are way too extreme and waiting for someone to save them, some of the most lost doomers I've seen.</p>
<p>It's fun having contact with the right again tbh, the majority don't care that I'm trans, they just hate the whole 'trans agenda.'0 I completely sympathize, because I've said for years that the trans lobby has been pushing way too hard to manufacture behavioural change through shaming. They don't recognise that the way to get on with 'cishet white men' is to stop acting like entitled brats and start acting like regular people.</p>
<p>Same with lockdown, screaming at folks for being racist, anti-mask, granny killing morons. Too many trans folks just can't control their emotions, I get it, there's a lot of trauma. Not sure it has clicked yet that trans rights have fallen waaaaay down the list now, and isn't any kind of priority for any number of people. This is the time for trans folks to quiet down and find a better way to integrate into society rather than trying to reform it around their needs.</p>
<p>Nice to know there's other queeroid skeptics! Gotta say it's weird to have purple hair and no testicles, yet seeing so many others acting like ball-less clowns.</p>

        <p>Absolutely. Worldwide, it's non-whites bearing the brunt of suffering, whether from lockdown effects, or the virus itself spreading to vulnerable people. I've been learning about just how bad systemic racism is compared with other group types, and it really bothers me that hardcore lockdowners don't see how in ways they could be perpetuating that momentum.</p>

        <p>Queer and here! Don’t forget how the govt completely ignored AIDS for years because they hated gay people. This panic obsession with covid is because it primarily effects old men and that’s the majority of politicians... </p>
<p>Also remember that lgbtq youth are more likely to be in abusive home situations especially if their parents are homophobic... and also lgbtq people in general are way more likely to kill themselves, and suicide rates are soaring. </p>
<p>We need to open back up, reclaim our gay community spaces and get our lgbtq youth back into schools where they have counselors and teachers to report child abuse.</p>

<p>Fauci by the way really promoted a lot of dangerous shit with the AIDS crisis in the 80s. He's a fossil who fucked up then, fucks up now.</p>

        <p>&rt;Don’t forget how the govt completely ignored AIDS for years because they hated gay people. </p>
<p>while most all governments hate most people, including homosexual people, it is especially now important to point out the actual background of the whole aids issue.</p>
<p>based on positive hiv tests children are stolen from loving parents (yes this is happening)</p>
<p>regardless if the mother did a positive test and then later had a negative test.</p>
<p>the hiv test are as precise as the rt-pcr covid-19 test.</p>
<p>this means, that they are completely worthless.</p>
<p>if you want to look at example experiences of mothers and the background of what i said, then i can highly suggest this documentary:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2T0Z-FOmf0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2T0Z-FOmf0</a>  (it aired in cinemas, and later the creators decided to also upload it to youtube)</p>
<p>if you get to understand the aids scam and the deadly medications forced onto children like AZT, then you can easier understand, that the current covid-19 tests can also be completely worthless, testing goats and fruit positve:</p>
<p><a href="https://qz.com/africa/1850839/tanzania-president-magufuli-blames-covid-19-rise-on-faulty-tests-goats/">https://qz.com/africa/1850839/tanzania-president-magufuli-blames-covid-19-rise-on-faulty-tests-goats/</a> </p>
<p>other articles about the worthless rt-pcr "covid-19" test:</p>
<p><a href="https://bpa-pathology.com/covid19-pcr-tests-are-scientifically-meaningless/">https://bpa-pathology.com/covid19-pcr-tests-are-scientifically-meaningless/</a> </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>and just to be clear, yes the whole aids agenda is targeting homosexuals at a far greater rate, as they are getting pushed to do tests and the doctors can interpret the tests too.</p>
<p>understanding the power of worthless fake tests, that create fake infection numbers and fake death numbers means, that they can continue their stupid worthless  infection and death number scam as long as they want for covid-19.</p>
<p>it is just one scam after another to harm us, to break up our loving families and steal our children and to remove all basic freedoms.</p>
<p>and in case, that you think, that "they can't steal children based on some positive test result from a worthless test", yes they already did and will keep uping their game:</p>
<p><a href="https://parentalrights.org/it-finally-happened-child-taken-due-to-covid-19/">https://parentalrights.org/it-finally-happened-child-taken-due-to-covid-19/</a> </p>
<p>also forced testing in germany already too:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67vVKiwmlYs&amp;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67vVKiwmlYs&amp;</a> </p>
<p>in practice this means, that  the criminal government  entered a private school, no one informed the parents and no consent was given.</p>
<p>then those people forced  rods down the children's throat with children saying, that they also got pain from that.</p>
<p>so they went against the parent's will and violated the children  and traumatized them a lot through this all against the basic human and parental rights.</p>
<p>we're already there and it is getting worse and the fake worthless tests are used  to justify it generally and the same applies for the hiv tests.</p>
<p>i just couldn't let this statement from you stand without response, given how important it is to understand the scam and that the covid scam isn't the first fake test based scam :/</p>

        <p>Lesbian here. I'm pretty openly against masks and lockdowns in real life, and people almost always agree with me but I do live in Texas. I've struggled with alcohol abuse in the past (which is a common problem for LGBT people) and all the stress from lockdowns just compounds with personal stuff to make it even worse.</p>
