    <strong>Stumbled on this sub and wow....</strong>
    <p><p>Not going to argue or respond back trying to do a counter point, I’m just genuinely curious. Seems like everyone here is against a mask and believes the virus hasn’t killed much people (2.5 million is the “official” death toll. It is interesting to see people from all over the world in here. My question is why do you think this virus was fabricated ? And why do you think restrictions exist all over? What do all the world governments have to gain by doing this ? It’s terrible for the economy</p></p>

        <p>I’m not walking into a room or asking to defend anything, you don’t know me, why the hell would I ask you to defend yourself ? You  make it seem hostile...it’s just a question no need to get offended. In the length of your answer you could’ve just answered my question. I’m genuinely curious what all the governments are benefiting from this, I couldn’t find discussions on here about it.</p>

        <p>Three questions with lengthy, involved answers.  Many before you have come in with similar text, many will after, and the questions themselves suggest you haven't made a sincere attempt to understand anything yet.  Spending time deciding how to address broad, open-ended questions is rather more involved than the previous boilerplate response.  For example, there is no such thing as a simple explanation for why an internationally-tied first world government comprised hundreds of thousands of personnel in separate branches does something, and any answer that attempts to trivialize that process is wrong.</p>

        <p>The world is different than you think. You are asking too much of us to educate you. There is a major cognitive dissonance hurdle for you to overcome before you will be able to look at the facts objectively. No offense but you are wasting your and our time. Please feel free to browse the sub, it is full of information. Also sift through the large number of posts identical to yours. We haven't come upon these truths lightly, it's not as if a random magazine article or Facebook post changed our view of the world. Your awakening will also not be so simple. If you can open yourself up to the possibility that governments work for and are directed by money and power, that they don't care about you, and that the news is a lie, you would be better able to see things objectively. Ultimately, it is your present belief in your government and the news that may prevent you from doing so, however, the only argument you have on your side is that "this lie is too big to believe".</p>

        <p>You don’t know my side lol. You just said a bunch of non sense, instead of answering my question. In doing so you basically answered it. Thank you. Facts objectively ? Just maybe give me one fact. “ Open Up” it’s fucking obvious governments work for power and money.....are you kidding ? Everyone knows they don’t give a shit about their people and the news is also fake, like everywhere....however, everyone in here seems to be part of a cult...not because of your belief, but because you beat around the bush. Once again what do world governments have to benefit from doing this? Like all governments all over the world.... if you can’t answer say that. Don’t write an essay with no substance</p>

        <p>I am under no obligation to write an essay to convince you of anything. If you are seriously looking for an answer, it won't be an easy and simple one. I am not in any position to ascertain your level of awakeness, and consequently customize an answer to fit your belief system. There is a lot of information here, feel free to answer whatever questions you may have. The government's are not separate, they are being run from above, however me just saying that does nothing to sway what you believe about it. Therefore if you actually want to know if it's true or not you are going to have to find out yourself, my truth is useless to you</p>

        <p>It’s a test. Anytime you see the smiling assassin lady Jacinda queen of the middle earth in all her glory you know it’s the globalists. Christchurch was a test to see who would do Gun control. Pretty little jacinda got it done. Next step. Covid. A flu. What could she get done? Of course they have 0 cases. 0. So then after she begins it.. they move to other nations. Who will comply and with what. Masks. Shutdowns. Lockdowns. One mask. Two masks. Ten masks. Curfews. Covid passports. It’s all just a transfer of wealth. It’s not about the economy. It’s taking the money from the small and giving it to the big.</p>

        <p>Also I don’t disparage any deaths but that covid count is off at least 80-90% due to over cycled pcr tests. WHO even said to stop cycling it so much. YouTube search kary Mullis. He invented the test and won the Nobel prize for it. He will show you evidence they don’t post on 60 minutes. Also there are 3-4 million Muslims in basically Holocaust level conditions and no one is doing shit. Rape. Organ harvesting. Brain removal. That far exceeds covid issues. Go live on c span and just watch the morons in elected seats. Maybe 10 or so even know how to put on a mask. They know.</p>

        <p>The main ideas here are that masks should be a personal choice, while lockdowns should not exist. There is no evidence that fatalities are reduced by lockdowns, best case scenario is that they are just delayed. In the mean time lockdowns have so many negatives, there isnt even a point me listing them out. </p>
<p>Science-wise, we draw our arguments from the Great Barrington Declaration and official statistics.</p>
<p>2.5 million sound a lot yes, but we are talking about a highly contagious virus affecting 7 billion people. Considering the IFR is just 0.26%(twice as deadlier than the flu), there is no particular reason someone in good health should be afraid.</p>
<p>Also there is TB which also has 2.5 million deaths, diarrhea also kills 1.5 million a year, hunger-7 million and the killcount of cancer and heart disease is in the tens of millions and yet there are no measures to control them.</p>
<p>We here are against the illogical and tyranical rules of the new normal, protection of human rights and a better strategy of fighting the pandemic.</p>
<p>r/LockdownSkepticism (more science, less bs theories)</p>
<p>r/CoronavirusCirclejerk (more of a humour based approach) </p>
<p>r/LockdownCriticalLeft (Less Trumpists, more Marxists)</p>
<p>r/ChurchofCovid  (full on satire)
are also part of the family </p>
<p>NoNewNormal is pretty much the most radical of them all, so I guess you can get a better grasp on lockdown skepticism from the other subs</p>

        <p>My personal interpretation why all this happened? </p>
<p>After all the simulation games, (Event 201, etc.), the players involved were happy to finally be able to actually apply the "learned" behavior in reality with the spread of Sars-Cov2. Then, when there was lots of positive response from the public and record poll numbers, the spiral began.  The media, dependent on headlines and clicks, continuously fueled the whole thing for their own financial interests. The filter bubbles created by the social networks continuously confirmed all the actors as to the "rightness" of their actions. At a certain point, more and more free riders began to jump on the hype and exploit it for themselves (the central banks for cash abolition, the secret services for total surveillance, the WEF for its perverse "Great Reset", the large corporations for a reduction in labor costs, the pharmaceutical mafia for huge profits with forced vaccinations, the state+EU for digital passport, expansion of power and restriction of fundamental rights, the big tech corporations for dependence of state institutions on their IT infrastructure). Due to the apparently irrational behavior of the government and the collapsing corridor of opinion, conspiracy theories began to swirl around the actual motivation of the governments acting in a coordinated manner worldwide. At some point, they had reached the point at which reversal was no longer conceivable without catastrophic PR consequences.</p>
<p>It would be conceivable that these planning games were not organized altruistically from the outset. One wanted to condition the actors from the outset to reach for the vaccination products of the pharmaceutical industry in case of emergency. It worked out wonderfully - already at the start of the "pandemic" (I put the word in quotation marks because I do not want to adopt the WHO's change of definition in the wake of swine flu), the acting actors clearly formulated in March last year: "The pandemic is not over until you have all been vaccinated."</p>
<hr>
<p>This is about where the planning games stop, too. Forced vaccinations and economic, as well as psychosocial damages do not occur in it - this is "freestyled" by politicians and will cost those still correctly what.</p>
<p>The dissatisfaction with the measures has reached such proportions that they cannot be kept for more than a few weeks or a few months if the government does not want a civil war.</p>
<p>Entities like Gates, WEF and Amazon are just freeloaders who want to milk the situation. I predict little success for them with their plans. When the pandemic is over in the summer, they will retreat back into their closets and encourage themselves to be EVEN better prepared in the next pandemic.</p>
<p>We must continue to make our displeasure clear.</p>

        <p>This world is different than you think it is. To learn this information is a traumatic undertaking and can cause stress. I suggest opening your mind first to these understandings.  If you're willing to consider that what you've been taught your whole life might not be true than I would say you're ready to engage in a conversation: if you're not, than I wish you a good day.</p>
