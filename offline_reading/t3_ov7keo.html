        <p>I have a few friends with PhDs who dropped out of their field entirely because they knew the rest of their life would be spent chasing grant money and they'd never be able to do any real scientific investigation. Science is meant to be conducted for the sake of science itself, not some end goal of selling a product or making a profit.</p>

        <p>The biggest hesitation for me is the fact that most genetic counseling programs include clinical rotations, which would likely mean having to get the jab. I think it really depends on your sister's interests as well. I am very interested in functional medicine, holistic nutrition, alternative medicines etc. A lot of that is being shunned at the moment which also makes me question the academic environment in a conventional program, if that makes sense.I would really like to pursue Traditional Oriental Med, but the cost of the doctorate is rather high compared to earning potential unfortunately</p>

        <p>So many people are interested in learning from people with your knowledge. I am making the switch to starting an online course that teaches people about certain concepts of holistic/alternative healing. There is a science behind alternative medicines. My focus is on the endocannabinoid system, which most people aren't even aware exists or what its purpose serves, just like the biophotonic system. </p>
<p>Don't stop pursuing your passions for fear of not being able to find a conventional job. If you feel like helping others through your passion for natural healing is your calling, don't give it up. The world needs more healers, educators, and light-bringers now more than ever before. You can make a liveable income being self-employed and following your interests and dreams. I hope it doesn't come off like I'm trying to tell you what to do. I just don't want to see people turn away from their true calling in life because it doesn't fit the status-quo.</p>

        <p>Thank you for the kind words and encouragement, it means a lot!! I just wish pursuing these things didn't mean costly grad degrees. A masters (or acupuncture alone) costs about $50k and a doctorate will be about $100k. I know life is short but the hubs and I are in a pretty good place financially and just about paid off our undergrad loans which makes me debt adverse ha. <br>
If only we could learn through apprenticeship like the old days! I am also unsure about a career that is location dependent (such as working in or having a brick and mortar practice). We've been location independent for the last year or so and being able to escape MI winter was glorious ha. I think I just really need to do some more investigating and soul searching. I am a classic enneagram (or ENFP) so I have multiple interests and always have a hard time narrowing down or focusing on one thing lol. Again though, I really do appreciate everything you said!! :)</p>

        <p>Same for doctors , I have a few friends who dropped out after 10+ years because they became disillusioned with the healthcare system , they were treating the trauma and the cases just kept piling on, the only other options were GP prescribing prescription medication based on which company pays you to
Or to become a plastic surgeon and trick middle aged women(30+) into unnecessary vanity procedures based on the pharma company paying you too.</p>
<p>And now BigPharma is behind a large swathe of Pro Trans Kids narrative spend In the media as it's the next big market for them.</p>

        <p>I'd love to hear more about your story! I feel like this keeps happening to me. I was originally a dietetics major but switched cuz I couldn't get down with USDA guidelines (and found out about how messed up our food system is). So I have a minor in nutrition instead. Have a cert in holistic health coaching, tried pursing functional med, looked into Traditional Oriental Med, but real tempted to throw in the towel with anything health related after this year and go a diff direction</p>

        <p>I did biochem / bioinformatics. Vetted phd programs but really just wanted to stay local. By the time I got thru all my stuff I was so turned off to academia and industry was never a go. I actually specialized and did most of my lab research in rna nanotech (got published a bunch too). I loved it but I knew careerwise I couldn't do it. The politics and dealing with NIH etc was way too much. Also went the coaching route after. Thought of becoming a DO. It was rough because i did this all a little later in life - i retired from one career to pursue my science career and have ended up leaving that.</p>

I shadowed one locally, read Dr Upledger's book and was super interested in CranioSacral Therapy but like you mentioned I couldn't stomach conventional med school/academia. I am 32 and now trying to figure out where to go from here if it's not going to be something science/health related.</p>

I was in corp finance before i went back for science and so i started a company while i was finishing school and then i started a nonprofit with my mom right after i graduated that got really big especially because of the pandemic so im just plugging away with those two while i figure out my next move. I really dont want to go back to school - i already have 4 degrees. Fortunately both the business and nonprofit are doing really well so i guess i don't have to but who knows.</p>

        <p>Ditto. The uncertainty is unnerving but has made us really evaluate a lot of things in our life, and if anything helped us mold it into one that is better suited to what we want (silver lining to the chaos I suppose). I agree, while pivoting and dealing with the unknown is frustrating, I think it will ultimately be for the better :)</p>

        <p>Crapitalism. When money rules this is what we get. I don't think it is ever possible to maintain true capitalism. It always devolves into corporatism with everything and everyone with significant positions being bought by money. There are people who reject this, but you probably won't hear about them because the money media ignores them.</p>

        <p>I'd like to think there is a better way, but when you're working with mud bricks, you can only accomplish what mud bricks can accomplish. People might be too greedy and selfish for there to be a better way that actually works. In a lot of ways the most driven and competent people are also the most selfish and greedy.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, people who have no background in science don't seem to understand this. Scientists have careers, families and need funding to survive. There is a tremendous amount of politics in science, as is the case with all aspects of our lives.</p>

        <p>“The ultimate lesson is that science isn’t special – at least not anymore. Maybe back when Einstein talked to Niels Bohr, and there were only a few dozen important workers in every field. But there are now three million researchers in America. It’s no longer a calling, it’s a career. Science is as corruptible a human activity as any other. Its practitioners aren’t saints, they’re human beings, and they do what human beings do – lie, cheat, steal from one another, sue, hide data, fake data, overstate their own importance and denigrate opposing views unfairly. That’s human nature. It isn’t going to change.”</p>

        <p>I agree, I'd just like to point out what I often see as a misconception, which is that scientists (here I only mean researchers) are not directly bought as in "we only give you money if you produce this and this result". Most researchers are very dedicated people, with good intents, trying to get closer to the truth. With that said, I think there are three main ways in which researchers are "bought':</p>
<p>- A large part of the job is chasing grants, meaning we are pressured to select certain topics and to formulate hypotheses in ways that those giving the grant will most likely fund.</p>
<p>- Another thing is publication bias, such as not publishing null results (results where the hypothesis was not confirmed, where no effect is found), modifying the hypothesis after seeing the data etc. A big factor here is that journals unfortunately still prefer to publish studies with significant results (where there is an effect found). As the current system is built around how many publications one has, and it's also what gives prestige, it becomes a biasing factor. Foundations and other organizations giving grants are often also more inclined to fund  well-established researchers, which is often a consequence of how many papers one publishes. (It's of course not that simple)Journals also prefer novelty, which means studies aiming to reproduce previous findings are often neglected, and we are stuck with believing in "science" that is based on poor studies.</p>
<p>- As also seen during covid, many experts, especially early-career researchers, who don't have an established existence yet, are afraid to speak out, afraid of negative consequences from the employer, or even losing their job.</p>
<p>I'm saying these, because though I agree that there are big issues, I find the narrative that "big pharma just buys research and scientists" offensive as it the integrity of knowledgeable people who for the most part are in it for getting us closer to understanding reality. (with the pay and the hours, that pretty much only why you can be in it for the most part :D)</p>

        <p>It's actually way easier to buy scientists, they don't even have to know they're being bought.</p>

<p>Science today is more of an institution rather than a method. An elite institution for that matter because it's the elites who fund the majority of these institutions. </p>
<p>I've learnt there's no such thing as no strings attached money. Just like I learnt there's no such thing as completely no strings attached sex (but that's a conversation for another day lol).</p>
<p>Scientists are humans just like lawyers, bankers and politicians are human. In fact scientists maybe worse because they're usually the poorest of these mentioned professions and will do anything for more wealth.</p>

        <p>Perhaps it might be a good idea to know a tiny bit more about science. Science doesn’t make policies. Science is about testing various hypotheses. If one scientist says one thing, another can always put the idea to the test as well. If there is disagreement between them, more scientists will see what they find. You might find a scientist you can pay to lie for you, but that scientist isnt going to convince any other scientists, who can test out what that scientists finds themselves. Proving another scientist wrong is what all scientists aspire to, there is no greater honour. Once others find the paid scientist to be wrong, to only have said that for money, that scientists will lose all attention and their job as well. You can buy scientists, but you can’t buy science. That much is very clear when you look at the history of science. </p>
<p>Oil companies bought some scientists to tell the lies that lead in fuel isn’t harmful at all. But that was scientifically inaccurate, and other scientists showed that to be so. So the lie that lead is harmless was discarded. </p>
<p>Oil companies also bought scientists to deny climate change. But once again, when other scientists went to test it out for themselves, they found something very different, and so climate change is an established scientific theory (which is the best status a scientific idea can ever reach. A theory is something that has been tested independently so many times by so many different people, in so many different ways, that you can be sure that it is right). </p>
<p>Cigarette companies bought scientist to tell the lie that they aren’t harmful. Same story again.</p>
<p>Now some conspiracy theorists are trying to buy some scientists to tell lies about COVID-19. But with so much attention on this topic in the scientific community, everything is scrutinized by lots of scientists independently. If one scientists lies that COVID-19 is not dangerous, or lies that masks and lockdowns are ineffective,  or lies that vaccines are dangerous, other scientists quickly perform other tests, and show those lies to be what they are. Science always prevails. One scientists can lie, but those lies will quickly be found to be what they are. Science is what many people find independently, not what you want to be true. </p>
<p>Please get fully vaccinated. Many scientists all around the world have independent found vaccines to have huge positive effects, for each one individually, for their families, and for all of us. A conspiracy theorist wanting to hurt as many people as possible might be able to buy one or two scientists to lie for them. But you can’t buy the overwhelming majority of scientists, who each want to prove each other wrong, but instead all come to the same conclusions; that vaccines are incredibly effective, and are the best way we have of getting out of the pandemic. </p>
<p>Do yourself a favour, do a favour for the people you care about, do a favour for all of humanity, and get vaccinated!</p>

        <p>Lmfao you expect people to believe that anti establishment scientists are the paid ones in this case? Why would they willingly risk their careers, lose friends and family (shit like this happens when you’re skeptical of the vaccine) and hurt their public image? Nah man, you dont risk that unless you believe in it, they have something called morals, preventing them from recommending an untested vaccine that could have severe side effects</p>

        <p>Go read up on how science works. You have a very wrong understanding of it. In science, it doesn’t matter what you believe. The only thing that matters is whether fair experiments show something to be so, and if other people can independently come to the same conclusion. </p>
<p>Think of some scientists. You’ve likely thought of scientists who rose to fame because they disagreed with other scientists, and eventually showed them to be wrong. Science works from disputes. They are absolutely necessary. Science works by trying to prove an idea wrong. The best way to test an idea is to try to prove it to be wrong. If you keep failing to prove an idea as wrong, then it’s a pretty good idea. You will always be able to find scientist arguing for one idea or another. Because that’s how science works, all possibilities have to be considered. In the end, the most successful idea is the one they succeeds. It’s dangerous to cherry pick ideas that were discussed by scientists, that agree with your beliefs. </p>
<p>The problem is when you keep arguing for something that has been shown to be wrong. You can’t be a scientist while thinking that Newton and Einstein are wrong, and that the universe actually works as described by Aristotle. You can’t be a scientist and be confident that gravity doesn’t exist. You can’t be a scientist and be convinced that evolution doesn’t exist. You can’t be a scientist and be sure that vaccines aren’t safe and effective. Throughout history there have many scientists that have held such beliefs. They have argued their case, and put their ideas to the test. But these ideas failed, the real world didn’t match what they thought it would be like. In the end, experiments decide. If you ignore all the experiments that found something you didn’t want them to find, you have to accept that. Otherwise you can’t be a scientist. This is one of the core principles of science. Just like you can’t be a truck driver if you are blind, you can’t be a scientist if you ignore countless experiments whose results disagree with your beliefs.</p>

        <p>I’m aware of how science works which is why I dont trust scientists who thinks this matter is settled already. There is no way in hell you can know the vaccine does not have any longterm side effects when its only existed for less than a year. And the lenghts they go to censor anyone who questions the narrative also lets us know that its a load of horseshit. No scientist is questioning gravity, no scientist is claiming the world is flat (in their respective fields ofc) yet plenty of medical professionals question the vaccines and the lockdowns, and they get censored and slammed by the media for it (apparently journalists, politicians and fuckin social media execs are experts and get to decide who is right)</p>

        <p>I’m a scientist. I know how science works. I experience this first hand everyday. Are you a scientist? Where do you get your information? From sources that claim to support what you want to be true, or from genuine scientists who report what they find to be true, regardless of whether they want it to be true or not? Scientists are just as devastated to be living in a pandemic as everyone else is. We don’t want to be living in a pandemic. We would much rather be telling everyone that everything is fine. But it’s not fine, and so it is our responsibility as scientists to do as much as we can to solve the problem. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, some people just prefer to believe what they want to be true, rather than what the science actually shows. Their actions of refusing to get vaccinated and wear masks are detrimental to themselves and to everyone else. </p>
<p>The pandemic can go on for a long time if people don’t get vaccinated. Alternatively, if the vast majority gets vaccinated, we will defeat the pandemic. What do you want? The science is very clear on this, it has been independently verified by countless scientists all around the world. The effects are seen very easily. It’s your choice: do you want to help save the world, or don’t you?</p>

        <p>If you're not a shiller or a troll surely you're not a good scientist cause myself, being a philosopher (but knowing deeply how scientific method and science works) I've reached the exact opposite conclusion: no one under 60-70 years should take the vaccine. I've reached that conclusion reading scientific papers/articles and connecting the dots, that is what philosophers are good for, catching the abstract an general structure as well as the relations between  seemingly disconnected topics. Of course if you are a scientist and you are sure that the vaccine is good and safe, I wouldn't trust you very much.</p>
<p>Can you explain something to me? if the protein spike is safe, what is causing the dozens of side effects that seem to be a product of the action of the same? Not all side effects are autoimmune, it is easy to see that. If they are not autoinmune, then what the heck is producing those kind of side effects and <strong>deaths?</strong></p>

        <p>Having a philosopher lecture a scientist about science is just as absurd as having a scientist lecture philosophers on philosophy. If you want to know something about science, you go ask a scientist, not a philosopher. Your belief that you know more than scientist who actually work on this tells me that you’re not a very good philosopher. </p>
<p>First things first, a lesson in maths (which as it so happens, is something scientists are good at). Give something to hundreds of millions of people. Some of those will die afterwards. Doesn’t matter what it is. If you give hundreds of millions of people air to breathe, some of them will die afterwards. Not because the air is poisonous, but because they would have died anyway. </p>
<p>People believe in the power of annecdotes, even if the maths tells a very different picture. For instance, many people believe that flying a plane is much more dangerous than driving a car. Driving a car is much more dangerous, but when a plane crash happens, that news spreads far and wide. Fatal car crashes happen everyday, it’s not worth reporting. So people don’t hear about them, and have a false belief that flying in a plane is much more dangerous than driving in a car. </p>
<p>Same thing is true with vaccines. Millions of people have died due to COVID 19. A handful of people have died after getting a vaccine. And there are many more people who got vaccinated than were infected. </p>
<p>Your belief that only 60-70+ year olds should get vaccinated is based on numerous wrong pieces of information. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>COVID is deadly for under-60 year olds as well. About 1/5 of all deaths are in people younger than 60. That amounts to about a million people worldwide that have died from it despite being younger than 60. Without vaccines for people younger than 60, you would get millions of deaths every year from it. Are you ok with that? In every age group, the likelihood to die from the vaccine is far, far less than the likelihood to die from COVID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vaccine effectiveness. Vaccines make a huge difference to how the body deals with the virus. But like every treatment, they don’t work 100% of the time. It’s very rare, but people who are fully vaccinated can, and do still die from COVID.  The only way to deal with that is to prevent the virus from spreading. And by far the best way to deal with that is to vaccinate as many people as possible. A vaccinated person is very unlikely to spread the virus to someone else, and so it cannot spread exponentially, as we saw previously. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s not just about deaths. There are many harmful side effects to getting COVID-19. And though younger people are significantly less likely to die from it, a significant fraction of them do suffer long term negative consequences from COVID. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Immunosuppression. There are many people for whom the vaccine can’t help because their immune system is suppressed. They, like all other vaccinated people need to rely on the people they meet from not spreading the virus to them. They have no choice. Everyone else does have a choice. They can either reduce the risk to themselves, to their surroundings, to those that can’t get a vaccine, and to the society as a whole, or they can be a danger to all of the above. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virus variants. We’ve already seen numerous different virus strains pop up in the last year, each more dangerous than the previous ones. They are not going to stop coming, unless we prevent them from multiplying in the first place. If you don’t vaccinate people, the virus is going to keep spreading to millions upon millions of people, giving it the perfect ground to evolve and become more infectious and more deadly. At the moment, the death rate from COVID-19 is about 2-3%. That is a lot, compared to less than 0.0001% for getting a vaccine. If you allow the virus to continue, rather then stopping it in its tracks wort vaccines, it’s just going to keep getting more dangerous. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Vaccines are safe, vaccines help tremendously. Does it work 100% of the time? No. No vaccine does. No medicine does. Can things go wrong? Yes they can, but only very, very, very rarely. For everyone with a working immune system, it is orders of magnitude safer to get a vaccine than to not get a vaccine, and to risk getting seriously ill, and possibly also dying from COVID-19. </p>
<p>Here’s an analogy. You are outside in a dangerous hailstorm with tennis ball sized ice chunks. You can either stay outside and risk getting hit, or you can go seek shelter. What do you do? If you seek shelter there is a very small chance that a murderer will seek shelter in the same place, and kill you right then. It’s a very small chance, but if you repeat the same situation for hundreds of millions of people, some will die in the shelter. Alternatively, you could be too scared of a killer in a shelter, and stay outside, just hoping that you won’t get hit.</p>

        <p>&rt; Your belief that you know more than scientist who actually work on this tells me that you’re not a very good philosopher.</p>
<p>You don't know how science works? is ALL about logic and understanding concepts and procedures, following methods and making sense of all knowing that is only a part of the possible realities, so it must be falsable for the results not being included in the premises, science cannot scape logic, it must be based on it, then build over it from the grounds of each science. Saying what you said is so dumb, I'm not saying "I know more than a scientist" that's just bullshit, every person is different and there's idiotic philosophers as well as idiotic scientist that don't know shit about their own science, the same there's philosophers that don't know about some philosophers or even  understanding basic concepts..</p>
<p>You are NOT understanding the problem here: the covid vaccine WILL HAVE LONG TERM EFFECTS cause it changes DNA. No, it 's not the mARN that will change it, but the spike protein. I won't waste my precious time sourcing, go to my post records and search it, I already need to show it to another guy that thinks that knows everything... just for being a scientist.</p>
<p>For you everyone needs to take the vaccine just to protect that FEW people that CAN'T take the vaccine, even if there's short and long term risk. Well, is just  hilarious. </p>
<p>The virus variants appeared BECAUSE OF THE FCKING VACCINE, you just need to check where the last trials of AstraZeneca were. Exactly, same places where the first variants started, then the countries of southeast Asia... Another mistake of your reasoning.</p>
<p>Does the delta variant kill more people? it is just more contagious, but since there's already a big amount of vaccinated people folloing your reasoning then it shouldn't be a problem. Another point here is that there's data that shows that the delta variant infects more unvaccinated people but relatively kills much more of those vaccinated that get it, so that means that is not effective in the worst cases, but probably the other way round. </p>
<p>We have already seen exponential grow of cases in places where most population have been vaccinated, for example Chile or Iceland, so once again, you're wrong or misguided.</p>
<p>You are thinking that the virus will be as dangerous as it is now but much probably that won't happen, that is not how normally virus works, and not how history works cause treatments will be developed in a very short time, in fact there's meds that cuts mortality, but again, you'll say that I'm wrong blahblahblah. Won't gonna waste my time, sorry.</p>
<p>good luck with the vaccine.</p>

<p>why? In previous pandemics, did the virus continue to kill at the same level after the first few years? What happened in the Spanish flu? did it not kill many more millions than covid in the first two years and then it became endemic and not so dangerous? perhaps 80% of the inhabitants of the planet were vaccinated? with an experimental vaccine? or perhaps that vaccine did not exist until much later because the tests that according to science and common sense should be done were carried out? Oh! actually what happened was that vaccines were made against bacteria because it was not known that the cause was the influenza virus... uhmmm Science is always 100% effective.....Now we know that spike protein itself is dangerous and the "scientists" are still pushing that shit.</p>

        <p>So, all companies and scientists that don't support the left-wing positions are bad. But all scientists that support left-wing positions (many of which are debunked) are completely clean and good. And you're definitely not gaslighting us.</p>

        <p>There is no left wing science. There is no right wing science. Science doesn’t care about your political beliefs. If you jump out of a window, you’re going to fall. Gravity doesn’t give a damn what party you vote for. The same is true here. COVID-19 exists regardless of what you think about it. Vaccines are incredibly effective against COVID-19 regardless of your political opinions.</p>

        <p>Yes, there is left-wing and right-wing science. Political-based science is taking the data (which is the actual science) and co-opting it for your own benefit. Like ignoring vaccine adverse effects data while celebrating that they "may have saved 60,000 lives."</p>

        <p>What political parties do is up to them. They can support, ignore, or deny science. A political party can say they gravity doesn’t exist. But gravity will still exist, regardless of what they say. It’s absurd that some politicians argue against science, that science is still going to exist. </p>
<p>It’s not a good idea to look to politicians to get answers to scientific questions. Look at what scientists say. </p>
<p>For the example you mentioned, vaccines have saved hundreds of thousand of lives already, and will save millions of lives. If politicians say that as well, good on them, they are just reporting what science says. There are some adverse effects, but they are insignificant compare to the adverse effects of not getting vaccinated. It’s like choosing between being rammed by a skateboard or by a car. Sure there are some side effects to being hit by a skateboard. But they are completely insignificant when compared to being hit by a car.</p>

        <p>Well' I'm glad you pointed yourself out as a follower of "science" instead of science. Science, again, is the data extracted from performing experiments or observations. The conclusions you draw from the data are entirely subjective. </p>
<p>I'm glad you threw out the false equivalence in the end there; It just further proves my point about you. The vaccines don't work, anyone looking at the scientific data can see this. </p>
<p>We have more cases now than we did a year ago, and the death counts are skewed due to the bad science the CDC is employing in their counting. Suppression of data is inherently anti-science, but is pro-left wing science.</p>

        <p>I’m glad you’ve confirmed that you don’t care about experiments, and that the only thing you care about is what you want to be true, rather than what is actually true. If only you would look at which people are the ones getting sick now. But unfortunately that would contradict what you want to be true, so you’re just going to ignore it.</p>

        <p>Experiments results in data, and when the data is co-opted for someone's benefit - aka your lefty politicians - it isn't science. You're just a moron for believing them.</p>
<p>You'll get a nice Darwin award, though, for trusting lefty science, but the difference is it's not so good for you. But it's great for the people using lefty science to push for depopulation.</p>

        <p>How do you guys then explain intersectional feminism, or critical race theory? As far as i know, Those in power have a vested interest in shutting that down. Science is very much being conducted for the sake of science, saying otherwise when it doesnt align with your views of the world speaks volumes, i mean come on.</p>

        <p>You seem to confuse the words "science" and  "Ideology". They are not the same thing. In no universe of the multiverse is critical race theory to be considered "science" </p>
