    <strong>How to defund the government?</strong>
    <p><p>I live in Britain (press F for respect) and our government has just turned into an absolute authoritarian shitshow over the past 18 months. It was bad anyway, but this is a whole new level of worse. 80% of the public are in favour of lockdowns, and in recent local elections, the current ruling party (Conservative Party) has actually gained votes, even after 11 years in charge. The only credible opposition party (Labour) is also hugely pro-lockdown, but they're slowly dying off as the Conservatives adopt more socialist policies in order to placate that constituency - there are no mainstream voices against. In one part of the country they're already trialling UBI - we're just going full-on socialist at this point. </p>
<p>To fund all of their communistic shit they're printing money hand-over-fist, and inflation (possibly hyperinflation) is knocking at the door. The official figures are kept artificially low by putting price controls on things which are in the consumer price index. Anyone who lives here knows, however that prices are inflating at an alarming rate, a piece of 4x2" timber now costs ¬£9.60 ($13.50) and other essentials like propane and livestock feed are going up exponentially.</p>
<p>So here's my question, how can we, as citizens get away with giving as little of our cash to the government as possible? If we hold savings in GB¬£, we're getting screwed by quantitative easing, if we buy anything in GB¬£ domestically, we're getting screwed by sales taxes (on things like beer and fuel, taxes are up to 80% of the total price), if we earn in GB¬£ we're paying income tax and national insurance (income tax by stealth). The barter economy isn't really a thing and there's a massive push to go cashless, so avoiding direct taxation is becoming ever more difficult. I'm just pissed off with paying vast amounts to get screwed by government, unfortunately moving to America (long-term plan) isn't doable for the next 5 or so years for family reasons, so I'm stuck. Any ideas?</p></p>

        <p>Learn skills, grow your own veg if you have space. If not, try and move somewhere that has space. Vegetables are mostly gmo at the moment and will just get worse.
Prepare to change jobs (with new skills learned). Stay fit, stay calm, don't make any long term plans, get an ubuntu phone, put savings into something tangible instead of in a bank (I.e something that will hold a value later on). Practice needing less material things day by day. Ride this out and see where to go from there. Good luck üëç</p>
