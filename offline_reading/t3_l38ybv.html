    <strong>NHS and CDC say that you should still get the vaccine even if you have had Covid. Why?</strong>
    <p><p>My partner was diagnosed 9 days ago with Covid. Her illness so far has been mild. I may have it too but, have not been tested. I do have some mild symptoms and my breathing is a wee bit laboured but, nothing I can't deal with. We do not want to get the vaccine and would rather get the disease and let our immune system do it's job.   </p>
<p>My partner works in the care sector and they are currently vaccinating staff at her workplace (she is obviously off work at the moment). We were both hoping that this would prevent any need for my partner to have the vaccine (I will not have it no matter what and she does not want to have it either) but, it would appear that the NHS and the CDC are saying that even if you have had Covid, you should still get the vaccine. Surely the best sort of immunity would be naturally acquired through our own immune systems so why is there a need to still get the vaccine despite already having had Covid?  </p>
<p>Clearly something much more sinister is going on and they are determined to get this crap inside us whatever the cost. We don't want to be willing participants in this project but, my partners career (She is a CQC registered manager of a large project) could be jeopardised if she does not get vaccinated as the organisation she works for expects all staff to be vaccinated. She has been with this organization for 20 years.   </p>
<p>We are familiar with the work of people like Brandy Vaughan etc and we were already vaccine cautious. This has just reinforced the idea that we need to avoid this vaccine at all costs. Clearly there is much more at play here than a lot of people realise and we are concerned about the lack of resistance to this unfolding tyranny. I just thought I'd post this here to get you good folks opinion on it all.  </p>
<p><em>According to the NHS, you must get a vaccine even if you’ve already had the virus.</em></p>
<p><em>The advice reads: “Even if you’ve already had coronavirus, you could still get it again.</em></p>
<p><em>“The vaccine will reduce your risk of another infection and the seriousness of your symptoms if you do get it again.</em></p>
<p><em>“If you've recently tested positive for coronavirus – even if you have no symptoms – you should wait until 4 weeks after the date you were tested before getting the vaccine.</em></p>
<p><em>“The vaccine is your best protection against coronavirus.”</em><br>

<p><em>If I have already had COVID-19 and recovered, do I still need to get vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine?</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Yes.</em></strong> <em>Due to the severe health risks associated with COVID-19 and the fact that re-infection with COVID-19 is possible, vaccine should be offered to you regardless of whether you already had COVID-19 infection. CDC is providing recommendations to federal, state, and local governments about</em> <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations.html"><em>who should be vaccinated first.</em></a>   </p>
<p><em>At this time, experts do not know how long someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19. The immunity someone gains from having an infection, called natural immunity, varies from person to person. Some early evidence suggests natural immunity may not last very long.</em></p>
<p><em>We won’t know how long immunity produced by vaccination lasts until we have more data on how well the vaccines work.</em></p>
<p><em>Both natural immunity and vaccine-induced immunity are important aspects of COVID-19 that experts are trying to learn more about, and CDC will keep the public informed as new evidence becomes available.</em></p>

        <p>Also want to add that the vaccine is not proven to protect others but only protect yourself. Therefore if everyone who wants to be vaccinated gets vaccinated then why do they care if someone chooses to not have the vaccine?</p>

        <p>This is the million dollar question. Particularly if it is going to take years to even get the majority of the global population vaccinated. Not to mention, they don’t know how long the immunity will last, or even if it protects from these “new strains”. </p>
<p>I keep asking people when they think we can go back to the old normal, but they always say that “we just don’t know yet.” Well, in that case, I propose what I have proposed all along: let’s protect the vulnerable, allow those who choose to hide inside to do so, and lets open back up. We cannot keep the global community at large locked down indefinitely.</p>

        <p>&rt;Iet’s protect the vulnerable</p>
<p>Who are these "vulnerable" though. I keep seeing this garbage. My 80 yr old mothers been essentially trapped in a care home due to "protecting the vulnerable". I cant go visit ever and her mental health is deteriorating because theyre terrified that the rona is going to take out the other residents. If imprisoning people in nursing homes is what "protecting the vulnerable so we can open up" is going to be then no thanks.</p>
<p>&rt;allow those who choose to hide inside to do so</p>
<p>I hope they dont expect to be supported financially by everyone else while they cower inside indefinitely. They can live off what they squirreled away and can rejoin the rest of us when it runs out like actual adults.</p>

        <p>that’s a very black and white point of view. 
yes the explicit purpose of a vaccine is to protect yourself (prepare your body), but herd immunity is a real implied result. if you don’t get the virus (symptomatic or not), you won’t be a carrier to spread to others !! the vaccine reduces chances of contracting the virus, being contagious, and actively spreading it. all this mask wearing and vaxx-ing is about reducing statistical risk.</p>

        <p>because we don’t all have the vaccine yet. if we all got it in an instant. then yea i think it wouldnt matter as much for those who don’t want it, but that’s not how it practically works, in the meantime there is transmission and spread.</p>
<p>also we’ve seen resurgences of viruses that we all should have vaccines against but anti-vaxxers have abstained their children from...the longer a virus is alive and has time to mutate (potentially making older vaccines null), the worse for everyone</p>

        <p>I am a nurse in US....so watched both vax rollout in staff since beginning.  People who have had covid before have had to worst reactions. Last week when dose 2 was rolling out we had 1/3 call outs for over a week. </p>
<p>The adverse effects monitoring is scattered, inefficient, and not adequately transparent.  I believe it is much worse than reports lead atm. I wish someone would create open source monitoring for it, but the drug companies own out regulators, so it’ll be late when we hear everything</p>

        <p>I also working healthcare in the US, and observed the same phenomenon last week after round 2.  I also remember reviewing some slides on reporting adverse effects.  If I remember correctly, there was the system through the CDC, but also a patchwork of other orgs (including Kaiser) that was monitoring effects.  I can't help but think that could lead to an effect being reported in one system but not the other, discrepancies in reporting practices, etc.</p>

        <p>And what you said about the lack of resistance to the tyranny is so true. I just can’t understand why people are literally begging for the vaccine, pleading for harsher lockdowns (in my area people are bitching every.single.day that the vaccine rollout isn’t fast enough, and that our governor needs to impose harsher restrictions)  </p>

        <p>I’m guessing it’s because the CDC is well aware of the false positive rate of PCR tests, and many who “tested positive” didn’t actually have COVID. Therefore, these people who had false positives wouldn’t have immunity to the disease.</p>

        <p>&rt;Surely the best sort of immunity would be naturally acquired through our  own immune systems so why is there a need to still get the vaccine  despite already having had Covid? </p>
<p>You're absolutely right. Without getting too much into details, this is what happens...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>When you get Infected (Naturally) with SARS-CoV-2</strong></p>
<p>As part of your immune response, your body will detect the pathogen and break it down into its component parts (so down to the protein), in an effort to identify the pathogenic cells and destroy them. This allows antibodies to be created (if required, viruses can be defeated without a large antibody response) to fit the proteins on SARS-CoV-2's shell. As part of the process of identifying these pathogens, every protein structure is remembered in memory cells within the immune system, so if any part of the pathogen is encountered again, a swift immune response can be produced.</p>
<p><em>This concept is also how cross-immunity works, since SARS-CoV-2 shares a lot of its biology with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as the 4 known common cold causing Coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1). If you have encountered any of these viruses before, it is likely that your body will be able to produce a faster response to SARS-CoV-2, as your immune system may detect parts of SARS-CoV-2 which are common to the viruses mentioned above.</em></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>When you receive an mRNA Vaccine</strong></p>
<p>These vaccines have a small part of SARS-CoV-2's gene, in the form of messenger riboneucleic acid (mRNA) <em>(not the full genetic profile of the virus, just a small part of it which is unlikely to change with future mutations, but anything can happen),</em> so your body will only respond to that small part of the virus' genetic structure meaning it is a less robust immune response, and therefore the system's memory of the virus will be less robust. It will still protect you from all known variants of SARS-CoV-2, but it lacks a lot in the cross-immunity aspect I mentioned, in that if you encounter a similar coronavirus (or a heavily mutated version of SARS-CoV-2), the vaccine may not protect you from disease.</p>

        <p>Immunity lasts at least 8 months. This is also ridiculous, if you survived it once chances are it's not a significant threat, and even then it's still rare to get it twice. I am not getting it, no way. And I don't think they can force it on people because when they've tried to make it mandatory for schools or work or whatever there have been protests (eg Denmark a few months ago) and the order taken back. Nearly half of healthcare workers don't want it, a lot of the population don't want it - I really think there will be more resistance to enforcing it since it doesn't protect others, it protects the person who gets it so that excuse is gone and if you're not at risk then you have no legitimate reason to get it.</p>

        <p>There is a phenomenon, I forget the technical term (can someone help me here?) , where someone vaccinated might have a more violent reaction to a virus.</p>
<p>I have to wonder if the reverse might not be true as well in this case, with an mRna vaccine.  Your immune system is primed, you've had it, so the vaccine causes the larger reaction.</p>

        <p>Because they want everyone to get it, period.  It doesn't matter that you might not need it because we are not expected to be able to make decisions for ourselves.  Nanny state stuff.</p>
