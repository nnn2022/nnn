    <strong>I was a Science Journalist at a national magazine for years….</strong>
    <p><p>This is my first post here after lurking for a few months. I left journalism because basically every print job has disappeared, I do miss it though. I was an editor for years for a national science and technology magazine. During that time I was incredibly privileged to meet and interview some of the smartest people on earth. I had dinner with Nobel prize winners, toured the large hadron collider in Switzerland and got to see supercomputers that take up entire buildings and atomic clocks up close. In terms of “celebrity scientists” I can tell you that Neil DeGrasse Tyson is incredibly kind and thoughtful and Bill Nye is a repugnant grifter who’s rude to everyone. </p>
<p>During this pandemic I have been shocked to see what passes for scientific thought. It has turned into a religion and it’s frightening. I go for a walk every night and see these brain dead signs, “this household believes science is real” as if science is Jesus or Mohammed and requires faith. Science is a mode of thinking that requires constant questioning. Unfortunately science is being codified as a religion. The lab leak is perhaps the most crystallized example of this and the reason we need sometimes journalists and not scientists( the current state of journalism is another post for another time). The scientists said well there’s no proof of a leak so looking into the origins is 
a conspiracy theory. This is because science has become incredibly specialized and corporate driven. A journalist doesn’t think like a scientist, we think like detectives, we go wow that’s a weird coincidence the virus started a kilometer from the only level 4 bioweapons lab in the country. The scientists were scared of making waves, and thank god there were a few good journalists left who broke the story. </p>
<p>And now we come to our current predicament. I think the nicest thing we can say about these health experts is they’ve been mistaken about literally everything about the pandemic. More accurately they’re power hungry idiots who still know basically nothing about how this disease functions. And now the vaccine panic begins. Let me explain in very simple terms why this is bullshit. Africa and India have state of the art, modern, German built vaccine labs. They could have been producing hundreds of millions of doses, they didn’t because these greedy companies wouldn’t give up the patent. So the next time someone blames variants on the unvaccinated ask them why we’re aren’t giving them for free to the third world. Because it’s a moneymaking scam. </p>
<p>My wife and I have already had covid. Whether the vaccines are benign or more nefarious, there’s zero scientific reasons for covid survivors to take vaccines. Were young and fit and have antibodies and don’t transmit, we’re not risking our health. Why do we have to get them? Because they want to impose a social control over everyone. We must resist this with every fiber of our being. We need to be loud and get in their face and say NO. </p>
<p>By all accounts my grandfather was a disagreeable asshole. Sometime in 1942 or 43 I think, my grandfather took his two sisters and left his small polish jewish village and moved to the woods. His family yelled at him and called him a fear mongering idiot. One month later an Einsatzgruppen unit shot everyone in the village. He ended up killing a policeman and stealing his gun, and because he had a gun was allowed to join a resistance unit. That’s why I’m here, because he wouldn’t accept the status quo. I’ll never be as tough and as great as my Zaide (Yiddish for grandpa) but let’s just say surviving extermination gave my family a healthy distrust of governments and institutions. I’m not sure what’s happening now but it’s fishy. And I refuse to accept a segregated society between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated. I refuse a social credit system. I refuse forced vaccination. You’re not alone . RESIST.</p></p>

        <p>I seen covid coming from a mile away as they had weekly news updates in the U.K by the PM. If it really was as deadly as they say or make out then the death numbers would be a hell of a lot higher. The weekly PM updates where given to scare people and to divide the country. Fb was terrible as people threw the “ I can’t see my gran or mum but your getting pissed up in someone home”. I didn’t see my own sister for over a year and it wasn’t nice but I still went to my friends as I wasn’t locking myself away from the world. My friend had covid twice and I was really ill at Christmas 2019 and it’s the worst flu I’ve ever had. My friend got ill and so did loads of people around me. I had been to a concert in November 2019 and Manchester in the U.K is twinned with Woohan, and has loads of chines students from there. The abuse the Chinese people got at the time was horrible. Covid is about making people sicker, thinning out the heard and Divide and concur.</p>

        <p>Same here. I noticed I had it on January 19th 2020 and my city also has a huge number of chinese students, so much so that the only new flats which get built here are tiny bugman shoeboxes which are solely for affluent Chinese students.</p>
<p>*Loved the "Divine and Concur" phrase though 🤣</p>

        <p>I saw a post on the covidvaccinated subreddit of a user who just had a heart attack after taking the vaccine.</p>
<p>He says he will likely take more because he is more afraid of covid than having another heart attack.  He also said to "keep the faith" that taking the injection was a good idea.</p>

        <p>If he didn’t follow it up with “I would take another” he probably would have been blocked for misinformation. </p>
<p>I got block off one post on there because a mother was saying how she’s getting it for her daughter who is currently positive and I asked, I thought they said not to take it that soon after being positive because of the antibody interaction? </p>

        <p>His user history goes back years and he seems like a real redditor.  I find it hard to believe that somebody that created a reddit account and posted reddit-tier opinions for years would do something like that.</p>
<p>That subreddit deletes something like 90%+ of new threads because the mods are actively trying to prevent any troll posts.  The only threads that are allowed to survive are from people who have been active on reddit for years and their post history shows they fit the "narrative."There has been trolls on there no doubt, but they get deleted instantly.  It's an extremely strict sub, and that just makes it more concerning.</p>

        <p>Titles mean absolutely nothing except an increase in your paygrade. They do not reflect your intelligence, capability, experience, or ability to solve problems. </p>
<p>I know this from experience. I was recently corresponding with a computer security tech. He was having immense trouble with a very basic concept I  was trying to explain to him. He was asking me why we couldn't create a security measure a certain way.</p>
<p>No matter how I explained it, he just wasn't getting it. I explained it logically, with metaphors, sent screenshots, used different wording. </p>
<p>What resulted was a back and forth of him asking the same question 4-5 times as to why it couldn't be done. </p>
<p>This person had 6 <em>(six!)</em> titles after their name.</p>
<p>Titles are completely useless. BS is pretty much that - BS.</p>

        <p>Sometimes I stop and reflect on how I used to feel about science (both the word and the concept) versus how I feel now. I've lost all interest in it and often cringe when I hear the term, because I've practically been conditioned to brace for bullshit every time someone invokes the S word.</p>
<p>I've spent a lot of hours reading about public relations and how it functions; specifically how dirty industries like tobacco defended themselves in the past, and how these tactics are applied today. It is much more pervasive than most people realize and it has gotten dramatically worse in recent years as the internet has allowed these PR firms to reach people in new ways.</p>
<p>It used to be that I would see a compromised opinion piece or blog post or whatever maybe every other day - something that was clearly written by a shill based on the tone, familiar telltale phrases they used, and so on. It would be something talking up vaccines or GMOs, a friendly explanation as to why Monsanto's RoundUp isn't so bad, or maybe why organic food is a waste of money and - didn't you know - actually worse for the environment. That kind of stuff. It was always obvious, and while it was becoming more frequent, it was still a minority of the content I encountered.</p>
<p>It's no longer a minority. The red flags I learned to look for are everywhere, all the time. The hallmarks of corporate disinformation are present in nearly all mainstream covid coverage. It is coordinated and intentional, because this kind of thing doesn't happen any other way. It's shocking to me that it is even possible to do it at this scale, and that so many people fall for it.</p>
<p>I guess all of this is to say that people like your grandfather are going to survive, and a whole lot of others won't. The signs are all there. I moved my family out of Seattle last March when it was all first beginning, because it seemed clear to me even then where this was going. Everyone later told us we were lucky to have left right before it got bad, but luck had nothing to do with it. I'm not a doom-and-gloom kind of person, but we're headed for a very dark place if we pretend like it isn't happening.</p>
<p>Anyway. Thanks for your interesting post, and for being an honest person.</p>

        <p>I've worked on both sides of the media fence. I crossed over from journalism to marComms /PR about a decade ago. </p>
<p>I'm only in sports - I work for a body linked to large event currently occupying a small town called Tokyo - and I can tell you that, despite ostensibly being a non profit, we can and do throw resources at creating /killing news stories depending what suits our purposes (funding and doping /anti-doping are the two main concerns).</p>
<p>If I was working for a mega corp like Monsanto? </p>
<p>I'd have enormous cash resources at my disposal. </p>
<p>I'd be funding bullshit studies to distribute. </p>
<p>I'd be buying up legacy media ad space by the acre, for ads that never run, just to create a fiscal relationship / financial dependency on the part of these titles, which are struggling for revenue and desperate for money. </p>
<p>I'd be buying digital ads to "educate" the masses, I'd be funding "independent" documentaries / mini docs about how MegaCorp Poison has changed the lives of poor farmers in Craptavia or Shitistan or wherever.</p>
<p>I'd be laying on press educational trips to flagship MegaCorp factories /projects in the Caribbean, Maldives, Nairobi, the rolling vineyards of Napa Valley ("sure, you can bring your wife and kids, make a family vacation of it on us!")</p>
<p>That's just off the top of my head in however many minutes that took me to type.</p>
<p>Now imagine the tier of professionals that MegaCorp recruits from, the size of the team, the $ at their disposal, the political lobbying... I'm just some asshole working in a non serious field. These guys are slick high end killer corporate robots. They are gaming every part of the media.</p>

        <p>I hear you about science.  The concept of a "pure" scientific process isn't that problematic, even if it is impossible and only hubris or blind faith would make anyone in those fields claim otherwise.  But, I get it, you strive for objectivity, try to disprove your bright ideas and test them in foolproof ways before having others replicate your results.  Good idea.  In reality, we're just talking about corporate shills who can fake "studies" and results for the highest bidder, who spent too much time and money getting a degree in fields full of bloated egos trying to out-posture each other, fields completely devoid of ethics.</p>
<p>And medicine... what a joke.  In cahoots with all the disease causing corporations and the pharmaceuticals to keep everyone sick,  completely unable to create care <em>for</em> health.  This latest collaboration with the eugenecists will cost their profession whatever credibility they still had among the majority of the population.</p>

        <p>Not only do the "bad guys" fund questionable studies, but then their influence over the media allows them to misrepresent even the legitimate studies. Can't tell you how many times I've seen a blog post make an outrageous claim based on a study, only to click their source link, actually read it, and find that it says nothing of the sort</p>

        <p>A couple that I can think of off the top of my head that had an impact on me are:</p>
<p>Trust Us, We're Experts</p>
<p>Merchants of Doubt</p>
<p>Trust Me, I'm Lying</p>
<p>The first one is probably my favorite, though it's a little out of date and doesn't cover the extensive use of the internet due to its age. Still very insightful, and you'll immediately recognize many of the PR tactics they describe. The second mostly covers tobacco and climate change topics and isn't as "fun" to read but still worthwhile IMO. The third is specifically about manipulating the flow of information in the internet age, and how stupidly easy it is for PR agents to plant stories - real or otherwise - on blogs and other news outlets. It was popular author Ryan Holiday's first book (I believe) and curiously, he went all in on the covid hysteria despite having firsthand experience with corporate media manipulation. Very strange.</p>
<p>I have a handful of others that I own but haven't gotten to yet. I really should. I always recommend everyone bone up on this subject, because it's the thread that connects all of these supposedly controversial issues. If you can spot the signs of PR intervention (and they reuse the same tricks over and over, it's wild), it gives you a big leg up since you can quickly and accurately estimate whether a narrative is honest and substantive, or ultimately came from a corporate source.</p>
<p>The other thing that I've found useful is following the work of activist/watchdog organizations like US Right to Know. USRTK deals mostly with food and agriculture topics. They cover the activities of corporate front groups, shills, shady nonprofits, and so on who are trying to twist public perception in their favor. This has been really helpful for me for getting a big-picture look at how these systems operate, and understanding exactly what "spin" looks and sounds like for future reference. Spoiler alert: it is everywhere!</p>

        <p>Thanks for the recommendations. I've read the start of Trust Me, I'm Lying and didn't really grab me but I'm going to buy Trust Us, We're Experts and go into it since you recommended it.</p>

<p>I have a secret to this kind of 6th sense actually, if it comes from the government or a corporation it's a lie. No, seriously. It works 99% of the time. </p>

<p>Thanks for the list, it's hard to find good organizations when almost all of them are completely neutered and corporate. At a certain point you give us and say, "the whole system is rotten". I've only found a few that have principles like GNU, but that's pretty rare. I feel like those that are founded by great individuals are almost always good until that person leaves, then the corporate hacks take control and destroy the organization. Thanks again for the info.</p>

        <p>The media has been an an absolute embarrassment. I could rant for thousands of words about it. However Josh Rogin is a pit bull, him and a few others proved the lab leak. It was incredibly important for a Wash Post insider to break it because it provided validity for the asleep populace. He risked his entire career to break that story</p>

        <p>It’s complex and might require a book lol. However a very short explanation is journalism used to be adversarial to power. Now you can read Noam Chomsky’s manufacturing dissent and say it was never that adversarial, but it at least aspired towards it. Now media is run by giant corporations or hedge funds and they report what they’re told. But the journalists are just as much responsible because they desperately want to be part of the Cathedral ( the intersection of media, money and the state) so they are extremely protective of the status quo and hate the proletariat or anyone who questions their control of “truth”</p>

        <p>Yes that feels like a plausible explanation. We need a new counterculture, or at least a counterculture that is funded I  a way that it can make an impression on the  narrative. Hard to see how that's going to happen though.</p>

        <p>Just out of curiosity, have you considered the Fort Detrick lab leak hypothesis as a possibility?  The timeline of the whole outbreak is very suspicious to me</p>
<p>June 2019 Detrick was shut down due to 'safety breaches'</p>
<p>August 2019 a whole bunch of nursing homes have a 'mystery respiratory outbreak' which kills quite a few</p>
<p>October 18 2019 Event 201 takes place at the same time as the Wuhan Military Games.  Israel does not attend, the USA <em>places 35th</em> (yet later wins the Olympics?), multiple athletes confirm that they were sick from the games (Elodie Clouvel for one).  Perfect scapegoat to blame given that they know what research went on their since they funded it.  </p>
<p>November 2019 Wuhan starts having a serious outbreak of SARS-CoV 2</p>
<p>It is highly suspicious to me that they were so cautious to blame China over this, it reeks of misdirection and plausible deniability.  The initial outbreak was probably an accident, blamed upon China and then picked up as a political football and all governments and thinktanks have been running towards the NWO Police state of their dreams ever since then, knowing what a great catalyst it is.</p>

        <p>It’s certainly possible although highly unlikely. I’ll start by saying the circumstantial evidence really points to those military games being where it started to spread internationally. But again the fact it was in Wuhan points to that being the starting location. The Chinese have notoriously lax and unprofessional lab standards. They also have the ability to silence whistle blowers, where that’s less true here. I think we would hear more people coming forward if it happened here, it’s much harder to keep things quiet.</p>

        <p>I agree - it can be incredibly overwhelming to look around and KNOW what’s happening and watch so many people participate in it. Scary. I have to take a break sometimes and get away from it all, but I feel a constant urgency to be aware and protect my family from whatever is coming. Freakin sucks.</p>

        <p>It’s crazy how these Covid cult members repeatedly spout “I TRUST THE SCIENCE!” but fail to look at the science from the other side of the fence. It’s completely biased, because that’s how they’ve been brainwashed to handle this situation.</p>
<p>That’s not science they’re truly following, that’s a whole lot of lies labelled as ‘science’ to make it look trustworthy.</p>
<p>Remember, science is there to be questioned, unless it’s about Covid. Don’t question Covid. It makes you selfish and ignorant, you disgusting tin hatters!</p>

        <p>Here is some science for you. It's not the kind you like though. The vaccine is harmful. More specifically the spike protein which we now know activates our ace2 receptors which leads to pulmonary endothelial cell thickening a condition suggestive of pulmonary hypertension, which has  50-60% mortality rate 3 years from diagnosis. We know that this spike protein is in the vaccine and also the plasma of patients who have had the vaccine.</p>

        <p>I relate heavily to your story about your grandfather. It still baffles me with what our Jewish ancestors went through why so many jews are in support of the consolidation of government power and elimination of civil liberties.

        <p>Yeah I take your point, we’re sadly all flawed people. In Jewish intellectual thought there is a tendency to want to make the world a better place. This can be good in terms of giving charity, unfortunately it also produces a type of utopian totalitarian thinking like Marx.</p>

        <p>I agree, I find it also to be a very privileged way of thinking, as many people in the community have these ideas of what they believe to be best from their figurative golden thrones, while having never lived or experienced the actual struggles and realities of others less fortunate.</p>

        <p>Yep, it's a religion, and the media are the church. </p>
<p>We litterally fell back 500 years. The modern nations have collapsed and turned into theocracies with the exception of Sweden. Maybe in the USA the opposition against this insanity is strong enough to have a chance, here in Europe 60-70% of the people support the COVIDist coup fanatically so we're screwed.</p>

        <p>Hey, OP, I'll put it in plain english: this is a <strong>planned crisis</strong> at play right now also known as a <strong>false flag operation.</strong> Gov'ts around the world are coordinating and cooperating with this false flag.</p>
<p>-
The most damning evidence comes from the documents by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120101193642/http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/news/publications/scenarios-future-technology">Rockefeller Foundation called "Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development."</a> It is the blueprint for this pandemic: infect the people with a virus (as we now know the NIH/ Fauci subcontracted the gain-of-function research through Ecohealth Alliance based in NY who are partnered with the <em>Wuhan Institute Of Virology</em> as Fauci circumvented the moratorium, thus committing perjury &amp; breaking the law), fearmonger the public (as they're manipulating the PCR - which the FDA has recalled as a Class 1 recall the most serious type of recall - to fearmonger about cases in conjunction with the MSM) to give up their human rights to the state, like their bodily autonomy and freedom of movement, for the illusion of safety, while they consolidate significantly more control over society &amp; the people. They will want to install a biometric ID grid with covid passports &amp; IDs, which <strong>removes the public's right to move freely</strong> which will be dependent on your status on being injected with whatever they want you to be injected with. </p>
<p>-
Here's a short video about the Rockefeller documents - Operation Lockstep:</p>
<p>https://www.youtu.be/ha3lodn-CvI</p>
<p>-
Journalist Harry Vox talks about the documents as well:</p>
<p>https://www.youtu.be/fC3uzGikhQk</p>
<p>-
<a href="http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/993371585947965984/pdf/World-COVID-19-Strategic-Preparedness-and-Response-Project.pdf">The World Bank has called it a "Project" (Document).</a></p>
<p>-
<a href="https://torako.wakarimasen.moe/file/torako/biz/image/1625/48/1625480350336.jpg">World Bank image link</a></p>
<p>-
What they are using is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tE94KUYcglk">Hegelian dialectical process: problem, reaction, &amp; solution</a>.</p>
<p>-
James Corbett did a brilliant documentary called <a href="https://youtu.be/TY-vLrz9XCc?t=3046">"Who Is Bill Gates?" and part three is on the biometric grid and it starts 50:46.</a></p>
<p>-
This planned "crisis" is to transform and transition society to a bio-security state, global technocracy, neo-feudalism, or whatever one wants to call it with a biometric ID grid for <strong>population control</strong> - a Chinese style surveillance state - where you're status of taking the vaccine experiment will determine if you can participate in modern society with your covid passport &amp; IDs or "digital certificates" as Bill Gates let slip up in his AMA:</p>
<p>-
&rt;<a href="https://archive.is/wGsMl"><em>Eventually we will have some digital certificates to show who has recovered or been tested recently or when we have a vaccine who has received it.</em></a></p>
<p>-
Once this biometric ID grid is in place that comes with vaccine passports we will automatically have a Social Credit System, just like the surveillance, police state of China has. We will have a totalitarian, two-tier society where people will be discriminated and their human rights and freedoms stripped.</p>
<p>-
This is the hidden agenda at play right now that the public is not aware of. </p>
<p>-
The ruling class &amp; banksters, like the Rockefellers, the Carnegies (who have captured the medical field in the U.S. and abroad over a century ago with <a href="https://vimeo.com/577925818">the Flexner Report and with their "philanthropy,"</a>), Bill Gates (who has admitted to having a Malthusian ideology), and their ilk, who are eugenicists, who <a href="https://archive.is/22zqe">have a problem with the world population size</a> <strong>are behind all this</strong> and their control over these institutions is making it possible showing how far we've gone along with this facade, since many physicians and scientists can't speak out for fear of losing their jobs even though there has been a few who have spoken out. </p>
<p>-
One last thing the <a href="https://archive.is/04NhT">Council on Foreign Relations was co-founded by the Rockefellers and the Warburgs, and they along with other secret clubs/ think tanks <strong>control</strong> the MSM</a>. The linked image was shared on Twitter by none other than <strong>Julian Assange</strong> which resulted in his Twitter account being taken down.</p>

        <p>A good comment I came across:</p>
<p>-
&rt;"The virus was released on the participants of the 2019 Military World Games, that were being held in Wuhan on the exact same day billionaire psychopaths were holding their Event 201 coronavirus pandemic "exercise" to make sure all their ducks were in a row for the release, both held October 18, 2019. One month later, after all the participants of games returned back to their home countries to initiate the spread, the alarms are sounded by all those involved with Event 201 as the first cases were reported in Wuhan. It's really not that hard to figure out once you look outside MSM propaganda for the truth.

<p>Yup, did you notice Google/ YouTube is in there too? They're part of the propaganda machine hence the draconian censorship. They are the modern book burners.</p>
<p>&rt;Strange to see no BBC though. Is it owned by a different branch of these folks?</p>
<p>Can't say, probably owned by others who are in bed with them, or maybe the image is incomplete, but I would also add them to the list of compromised outlets.</p>

        <p>Yeah YouTube is basically the one I’m least surprised about, lol. I’ve known for a while that the entire media is owned, but I just didn’t know just quite how much of it there is, and what a small group of people own the damn thing. 😂 </p>
<p>There’s been a lot of healthy Covid debates in my friends group recently. Everything I say is countered with an article from fricking Reuters, to which my response is always the same. Now I can use this to illustrate the fucking point better lol. </p>
<p>Just to confirm, this truly came from Assange? It looks about as legit as can be.</p>

        <p>It was shared by Assange, but not sure if he created it or if he contributed. I guess you can say he gave it his stamp of approval by sharing it. And when I link the original address of the image link my comment gets shadowbanned. Good thing we have archive sites.</p>

        <p>I agree with you until you said the part that journalist are detectives. Fact is half of journalist works as stenographers just copying what Reuters or AP send over the wire. The other half are busy writing public relation stories to create a financial or political narrative and then you got a tiny little group who has been fired or left all major mainstream publication because they actually wanted to perform journalism.</p>
<p>There is no group I loath more then journalist. I would rather sit next to a murder or rapist then a journalist working at mainstream media.</p>

        <p>Might not mean much coming from a stranger but I really enjoyed your writing style here. I know you said you left journalism with good reasons, but if you ever decided to just throw some words down about a world topic (like covid) that intrigues you I’d love to read them. Some things that should be common sense I never really realized until you put them into words. </p>
<p>The way you described journalism as being more detective than writer was a really interesting way to explain it. definitely going to be stealing that one.</p>

        <p>I have a question for you, since you've had a career inside science journalism.  I've seen so much misinformation being spread by the media--particularly regarding the mortality rates for COVID-19.  CFR is rampantly confused with IFR, making the death rate seem higher than it is.  Death counts are being presented as if they're unprecedented and catastrophic.  My question is--what, if any, coursework is required for journalists who cover science and medical news?  Do they all have to be experts in statistics (which I feel should be required)?  Do they have to have a certain amount of science coursework?  Do you think the insanely pessimistic media coverage is due to ignorance/lack of education, or deliberate money-grabs for their various media venues?</p>

        <p>Well you make a great point. There are a few journalists who have a deep scientific background. They may have a masters or PhD in a scientific field and then went into journalism later. However like 99% of them have little to no scientific training, myself included. I was well read on these subjects but no I’m not a scientist. I could take a hard to understand physics concept and describe it in a way anyone can comprehend. However I have no understanding of the underlying mathematics of physics. 🤷🏻‍♂️</p>

        <p>This is a great post, thanks OP. </p>
<p>I’m not a journalist, but do work in media and I’ve always been a staunch proponent of “media literacy”. People have been accepting whatever mainstream media tells them for decades, but the last couple of years has shown that large newspapers and networks can really control the masses in a way I’ve never seen in my lifetime in western civilization. You’d expect this with a country ruled by Mao, Stalin, Kim Il Sung, Hitler, etc. but not “free” western democracies and constitutional republics. </p>
<p>There are some notable American journalists who are asking questions (Greenwald, Taibbi) but they’ve been accused by other outlets of being grifters and far right apologists, which they’re not. </p>
<p>I don’t really know how to process what’s happening. The public has stopped asking questions or demanding answers and labeling those that are as conspiracy theorists.</p>

There’s something not right about all this. I am not vaccinated and whilst many of my friends share my views etc I have been directly affected by not getting the shot/shots/ series of never ending shots... My local bar has just said any live music shows moving forward, you need to show either a vax certificate or a negative covid test. I got tickets to see a band end of September and now I don’t know what to do. I don’t even want to take the test you know?  It’s like then I am part of the problem, I will be in the system. I know some won’t understand this but that’s how I feel. My gut instinct on all of this is that in the beginning yes there was not as much known about what was going on, how bad the virus might be etc, steps were taken, lockdowns were implemented, all kinds of things happened but I feel now that many who are in positions of power know that they were wrong but they cannot cannot say that they made a mistake? So they just keep on blindly mandating all these ridiculous draconian rules and it’s simply too late to go back and make changes, obviously , and they feel their hands are tied?? There’s so much evidence that states or counties that were not masking and didn’t have such strict lockdowns were recording  better figures?. In my heart of hearts I do feel that it’s too late now for anyone in power to turn around and say we made a mistake.  Imagine what that would be like for all the people that blindly followed their leaders so to speak. It’s like a nightmare and every day I wake up and I’m filled with dread about the future and sometimes I just feel like checking out I’ll be honest.I will die on this Hill. I am not getting the vax. #resist.</p>

        <p>I agree that it is 100% money motivated on the part of the pharma corps, and that they have moral culpability in pushing this bs on the world. </p>
<p>But your point about not sharing the patent, and the african/indian vax labs is wrong, or at best irrelevant. </p>
<p>For one thing, a lab is not the same thing as a commercial pharma manufacturing site, which is what you would need to produce vaccine at a meaningful scale. For another thing, contract manufacturing is widespread in the industry, and is being used for all the covid shots. </p>
<p>Literally every bioreactor in every facility known in the world is spoken for for at least 5 years out. The global manufacturing capacity is unable to produce enough filters to keep up with the demand for these bioreactors. Similarly, pharma grade glass vials cannot be manufactured quickly enough to meet demand. Non-FDA approved sites in China are being used, the demand problem is so bad. </p>
<p>And that is the real horror story I would focus on if I were a journo. Covid is bumping other drugs down the list all around the world. Drugs that are actually life-saving. Cancer drugs. They're sacrificing actually sick people for this covid bs.</p>

        <p>The line between science and politics started blurring with global warming and climate change.  I'm a mechanical/aerospace engineer and have had jobs where I've done fluid simulations (CFD) for a living.  I decided in the past to look at climate science journals and see the quality of what was being published and realized I didn't even have to poke holes in their analyses or arguments... it was already swiss cheese.  But if you bring up the issues anywhere, you get the "but <em>you're</em> not a "climate scientist*"... no but I have a master's (and almost got a PhD) specializing in mechanical engineering (fluid mechanics and thermo) and can easily read and find fault with papers like that.</p>
<p>Long story... the line's already been blurred and people have already been conditioned to regard science more like religion.  Climatology prepped it.  That was supposed to be the crisis which requires more government control.  This whole pandemic was basically christmas coming early for government using "science" as a means for control.</p>

        <p>“Because they want to impose social control over everyone.” </p>
<p>Spot on. As are your points about science essentially being turned into a religion. It’s cringe af when I see the “We believe science is real!” signs in people’s yards. Just another way to divide and control us.</p>

        <p>~~I’m a former research fellow at certain world renowned medical clinic whose name rhymes with “hey-o”.~~</p>
<p>~~I’m astounded at how sloppy the science has been. We were given marching orders by hospital administrators in late January 2020 to not talk to the press. Then my director was fired and they installed someone from the WHO. He had us falsify most of our lab work. Patient names, bloodwork, viral levels. All to drum up fear. I finally quit. Many of my fellow PhDs were forced to make a choice: career or the truth. I have some, shall we say- family money and was in a position to say “Enough!”~~ </p>

        <p>Nice read. Since you believe you had covid, I assume you never researched Kary Mullis, the inventor of the PCR test? 
It's been more than a year of this plandemic, people need to research all the root info, not just the basic conspiracy stuff that is mentioned on msm.</p>

        <p>I really like Krystal and Saagar at Breaking Points. He’s a conservative populist she’s a liberal populist, they’re great. It’s tough because most science news is fine, if extremely pro corporate. But as this story is political in nature there’s a lot of pressure to spin it certain ways. Josh Rogin at the Wash post is good. Glenn Greenwald, Matt Taibbi</p>

        <p>Thank you for your post. I haven't read such a nice post for a while. The same people who were agreeing the virus being made in lab got their shots and nowadays criticize others who don't want to get. They forget whole scenario already, not asking themselves if it was lab made, then it is a part of that plan. I am not claiming whether plan is bad or good but the way of application is terrible, helps a lot to asshole dictators, regimes with inclines to dictatorship and multimillionaire corporations.</p>

        <p>Thanks I really dug reading your post.  Loved everything you said but disagree about the lab leak theory or whatever it’s called.  </p>
<p>There are a lot of people who believe viruses don’t really exist.  Most (especially sars COV2 and famously HIV) have been fraudulently isolated/purified and never actually proven to cause disease.  If you look into the work of Stephan Lanka (scientist/virologist), Drs. Tom Cowan and Andy Kaufman (along with many others) they pretty much prove this with sound and accurate science, not ‘the science’.</p>
<p>You actually may be super interested in researching this since you used to work for a science mag.</p>
<p>Imo the lab leak hypothesis is just another way to scare people into taking vaccines.  </p>
<p>There is definitely a spike protein but it’s genome was fabricated in silico (on a cpu) and it was manufactured and never found in nature.  The genome is from an organism that does not exist.  There’s the lab leak, except it’s more like a direct injection into people’s arms.  </p>
<p>Thanks again for sharing the kind and uplifting words, I and others definitely appreciate it.  this was in no way a call out, just spreading some info you can choose to look into if you want.</p>

        <p>If you read the papers on physical isolation closely, you will see they've actually failed to do so with the 'novel SARS-CoV2' virus. Not saying no viruses exist, that is a bit more than I will admit, but the whole claim of physical isolation and further genetic sequencing of a novel virus proven to cause covid-19 is nonsense. Scientific fraud.</p>
<p>Check CDC website for titles claiming physical isolation and read it <em>closely.</em></p>

        <p>Thanks for baking me up - herpes and chicken pox are the only ‘viruses’ to be properly isolated.  That said there is no evidence of them existing outside the human body in nature and when exposed to these isolated ‘viruses’ directly (isolating them and exposing people to them) they do not cause the same ‘diseases’ in the people exposed to them.  With herpes a sexual act needs to occur and chicken pox are most likely a natural body’s process.  That’s the best I can do to explain actual viruses from my sources.  Anyway we need a new name for these things lol, thanks again.</p>

        <p>Most people who scream about "trusting science" have no concept of what science actually is and likely never will.  We currently have agendas and opinions masquerading as science.</p>
<p>Imagine if any other group were discriminated against like people who have not been vaccinated are.</p>

        <p>For those of us who have not been infected with COVID, it’s a pick your poison moment.  We have to guess at which is riskier because not much is known about covid or the vaccine in the long term.  All we can do is guess and hope we guessed right.  Judging people for their guess is stupid.  You do you, I’ll do me.  Everyone needs to stay in their lane.</p>

        <p>Beautifully put. Thank you for posting this.</p>
<p>I read this post right after learning about Oregon's new mask mandate: $1,000 fines for non-compliance and a government "snitch line" to rat on anyone not wearing a mask --and this is <em>after</em> having reached their vaccination targets. </p>
<p>This is headed in a dark direction and I'm not sure where.</p>

        <p>&rt; I can tell you that Neil DeGrasse Tyson is incredibly kind and thoughtful and Bill Nye is a repugnant grifter who’s rude to everyone. </p>
<p>I can totally see this.  Bill Nye is an asshole.</p>
<p>&rt; The scientists said well there’s no proof of a leak so looking into the origins is a conspiracy theory. This is because science has become incredibly specialized and corporate driven.</p>
<p>Don't forget politics.  Trump hinted at a lab leak but people have such severe TDS that they would do the complete opposite even if there were nuggets of truth in what he said.  I believe there was an NYT article or something that had scientists saying they didn't want to be associated with Trump.  I'm guessing it may have something to do with science being corporate driven.  In other words, if Dr. X gave credence to the lab leak theory, they may not get grants in the future because muh Trump.</p>
<p>&rt;   They could have been producing hundreds of millions of doses, they didn’t because these greedy companies wouldn’t give up the patent. So the next time someone blames variants on the unvaccinated ask them why we’re aren’t giving them for free to the third world. Because it’s a moneymaking scam. </p>
<p>Bill Gates even admitted that they were not going to share the patents.</p>
<p>If COVID is as serious as "they" claim, and if "they" claim to have our best interests at heart, they would have worked something out.  How much richer does Billy need to be?</p>

        <p>Definitely happy you decided to stop lurking and that you are a journalist who is aware of how far your profession has fallen.</p>
<p>I feel that reporters should only have a single beat to cover and that they need to be double-majors. Science reporters should have a journalism B.A. paired with a B.S.--preferably in bio or chem. Domestic political reporters should need a B.A. in poli sci or history with a concentration in American history. Business/financial reporters should have a B.A. in econ. Etc.</p>
<p>EDIT: Reporters need to have a beginning level of "expertise" in their field to even be able to know what questions to ask more knowledgeable people--politicians, military officers, etc. Seeing reporters asking people the same basic questions of subject matter experts infuriates me--especially on TV because the segment might only be five minutes of answering basic questions that someone who doesn't know could do a quick Google search and discover the answer.</p>

        <p>Thank you, nice post. You had a smart and brave grandfather. I know many stories of Jewish people having less happy endings in my work as past life therapist. I do believe this is a time where we can react differently to the powers that be, but unfortunately the masses havent learned. </p>
<p>I think part of the problem is we had fairly good lives - most of us in western countries - and we have therefore not learned a healthy critical view on the government. </p>
<p>I have a background in journalism and communication and have been shocked at how little critical the media have been during this so called pandemic.   <br>
For years I have seen the media firing journalists and merging so there are only few publishers left. 
There are ever less journalists with a steady job paid to do research work.<br>
Freelance journalists often get paid very badly and by words, not hours. So to earn money it is not encouraging to dive deep into a subject.   </p>
<p>Nowadays I am wondering if all this was part of the plan. I worked in PR and communications a long time and often 'real' journalists looked down on us, but unfortunately I dont see any difference now - journalists have become PR machines for the governments and big tech companies.</p>

        <p>Nailed it. While I’d never claim the thought is originally mine, I’ve been saying for months that the old priest class surrendered their holy garb for lab coats - at least in the mind of the masses</p>
<p>The vaccine is your new saviour. 
The priest with all his dogma has been replaced by politicians and poorly dictated scientists 
The people are supposed to have faith in the elite who have had some sort of revelation (scientific breakthrough) 
The vaccine mandate is nothing more than a modern day religious crusade 
The inquisitions imposed on brilliant doctors and scientists who are a dissenting voice. Aka the silencing  of the heretic 
The claim that science is “the way” when in truth it’s a method that can be used well … or not. </p>
<p>I love science but wow, how easily it can be abused to serve nefarious political agendas. History show this to be true and we’ve learned little. </p>
<p>I could go on, but I’ll save that for a day when I’m thinking more clearly.</p>

        <p>1976 at age 18 I received the swine flu shot. Fell sick immediately. Double vision and headaches that felt like my head was splitting open with constant nausea and vomiting. Non stop visits to doctors. Parents were told I was faking it snd had mental problems. Was hospitalized in 1977 looking for brain tumors. Then after 6 months it finally ended. Fast forward to early 90s. Got the first of a series of three HIB shots. Got immediately sick. Extremely high fever that lasted weeks. Doctor told me not to get the last two injections because of the response I had. I have never had a flu shot because of the reactions I have had to these previous vaccines. I am pretty sure my body would not have a good reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine. In fact I am never getting another government sponsored anything.</p>

        <p>I met this elderly Polish woman. Her father fought in the communist resistance.</p>
<p>He ended up approaching the Americans when they liberated the region he fought in but didn't say who he fought with.</p>
<p>In the 70s it came out he was once a member of the communist resistance. He was fired from his job forced to sell his home and move. He had to take a lesser job and home. His children then immigrated to Australia.</p>
<p>His family would of been fine if joined the Waffen ss and surrendered or captured at Normandy or at the battle of the buldge etc as a few polish members of the waffen ss did.</p>
<p>The old lady worked in the public service here her whole time. Educated intelligent emphatic and really healthy for her age. A wonderful citizen not welcome in Poland because her dad fought the germans for communists.</p>

        <p>I heard my gf talking to her uncle who is the only person I know of who got rocked by covid and he was actually pissed because he took the vaccine and then was told by his doctor that he didn't need to.  The reality is that they they don't have enough data to confidently say how much immunity lasts for either method and there are certainly many factors for that such as the degree of exposure.</p>
<p>Sure, if you  just took a covid test that said positive, you might not have significant natural immunity.</p>
<p>Also, notice the flair says "opinion" and OP clearly states his background in journalism, not as a medical practitioner.</p>

        <p>"... there's zero scientific reasons for covid survivors to take vaccines" is not a qualitative statement. It's a statement of fact, and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01609-4">it's untrue</a>. It's misinformation and your community rules state that misinformation should be taken down. Whether the author is a journalist or has opinions does not change those facts.</p>

        <p>Hey, OP, I'll put it in plain english: this is a <strong>planned crisis</strong> at play right now also known as a <strong>false flag operation.</strong> Gov'ts around the worlds are coordinating and cooperating with this false flag.</p>
<p>-
The most damning evidence comes from the documents by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120101193642/http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/news/publications/scenarios-future-technology">Rockefeller Foundation called "Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development."</a> It is the blueprint for this pandemic: infect the people with a virus (as we now know the NIH/ Fauci subcontracted the gain-of-function research through Ecohealth Alliance based in NY who are partnered with the <em>Wuhan Institute Of Virology</em> as Fauci circumvented the moratorium, thus committing perjury &amp; breaking the law), fearmonger the public (as they're manipulating the PCR - which the FDA has recalled as a Class 1 recall the most serious type of recall - to fearmonger about cases in conjunction with the MSM) to give up their human rights to the state, like their bodily autonomy and freedom of movement, for the illusion of safety, while they consolidate significantly more control over society &amp; the people. They will want to install a biometric ID grid with covid passports &amp; IDs, which <strong>removes the public's right to move freely</strong> which will be dependent on your status on being injected with whatever they want you to be injected with. </p>
<p>-
Here's a short video about the Rockefeller documents - Operation Lockstep:
https://www.youtu.be/ha3lodn-CvI</p>
<p>-
Journalist Harry Vox talks about the documents as well:
https://www.youtu.be/fC3uzGikhQk</p>
<p>-
<a href="http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/993371585947965984/pdf/World-COVID-19-Strategic-Preparedness-and-Response-Project.pdf">The World Bank has called it a "Project" (Document).</a></p>
<p>-
<a href="https://torako.wakarimasen.moe/file/torako/biz/image/1625/48/1625480350336.jpg">World bank image link</a></p>
<p>-
What they are using is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tE94KUYcglk">Hegelian dialectical process: problem, reaction, &amp; solution</a>.</p>
<p>-
James Corbett did a brilliant documentary called <a href="https://youtu.be/TY-vLrz9XCc?t=3046">"Who Is Bill Gates?" and part three is on the biometric grid and it starts 50:46.</a></p>
<p>-
This planned "crisis" is to transform and transition society to a bio-security state, global technocracy, neo-feudalism, or whatever one wants to call it with a biometric ID grid for <strong>population control</strong> - a Chinese style surveillance state - where you're status of taking the vaccine experiment will determine if you can participate in modern society with your covid passport &amp; IDs or "digital certificates" as Bill Gates let slip up in his AMA:</p>
<p>-
&rt;<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fksnbf/im_bill_gates_cochair_of_the_bill_melinda_gates/fkupg49/"><em>Eventually we will have some digital certificates to show who has recovered or been tested recently or when we have a vaccine who has received it.</em></a></p>
<p>-
Once this biometric ID grid is in place that comes with vaccine passports we will automatically have a Social Credit System, just like the surveillance, police state of China has. We will have a totalitarian, two-tier society where people will be discriminated and their human rights and freedoms stripped.</p>
<p>-
This is the hidden agenda at play right now that the public is not aware of. </p>
<p>-
The ruling class &amp; banksters, like the Rockefellers, the Carnegies (who have captured the medical field in the U.S. and abroad over a century ago with <a href="https://vimeo.com/577925818">the Flexner Report and with their "philanthropy,"</a>), Bill Gates (who has admitted to having a Malthusian ideology), and their ilk, who are eugenicists, who <a href="https://archive.is/22zqe">have a problem with the world population size</a> <strong>are behind all this</strong> and their control over these institutions is making it possible showing how far we've gone along with this facade, since many physicians and scientists can't speak out for fear of losing their jobs even though there has been a few who have spoken out. </p>
<p>-
One last thing the <a href="https://archive.is/04NhT">Council on Foreign Relations was co-founded by the Rockefellers and the Warburgs, and they along with other secret clubs/ think tanks <strong>control</strong> the MSM</a>. The linked image was shared on Twitter by none other than <strong>Julian Assange</strong> which resulted in his Twitter account being taken down.</p>

        <p>Multiple people have had covid two and three times. Your antibodies will not last forever. Of course living a healthy lifestyle is great but you stated in your original post that there's zero scientific reasons for covid survivors to take vaccines. I take exception to that as there is no evidence post covid antibodies protect you from recurrent infection any better than post rhinovirus antibodies protect you from future colds.</p>

        <p>Well that’s not true, there’s dozens of studies showing covid anti bodies protect moving forward. With the caveat there’s a possibility you can reinfect. Ok I’m perfectly happy taking that slight risk.</p>

        <p>So your saying that the virus came from a bioweapons facility? But its also harmless? If its harmless then why would it require a level 4 security protocols? Why would anyone use a sars strain as a bioweapon when much better alternatives are already in use? You claim to know much about science yet you use anacdotal evidence to argue that covid is benign? You people throw arround low estimates of death statistics but don't acknowledge other longterm effect such as long covid.</p>

        <p>I never said it’s benign, it did come from a level 4 lab, that lab is obviously tied to the Chinese defense industry. You have to have a level 4 lab for gain of function which caused this. Ok great go get vaccinated I support your right to control your health. I also support the right of people to have a difference of opinion.</p>

        <p>The type of "gain of function" you speak of has occured many times before. Not once did it come from a lab. Wetmarkets have been known to produce SARS viruses in the past. Why would the case of covid-19 be any different?</p>

        <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'll admit up front that I'm currently favouring the other side of the argument. I'm genuinely asking these questions <em>not</em> b/c I want to "get" anyone, but because I want to understand, and be critical of my beliefs. I'm not American.</p>
<p>Is it not possible that vaccines work <em>and</em> corrupt people in power are making money off of them? That's what I currently think. Understanding that, as a species, most of us become greedy corrupt bastards when given the opportunity, and given the rules of supply and demand, if <em>anything</em> (including vaccines) has more demand then supply greedy people will try to capitalize on it. That doesn't mean the product is a scam, it just means people are doing what most of us would do: being greedy and corrupt.</p>
<p>I also see a lot of points saying "what about x, why don't we have a vaccine for x?" The implied point (i think) is: why are we taking such extraordinary measures for Covid-19, hurting our economy, etc. When we don't take those extraordinary measures with x?</p>
<p>The main idea I have is this: transmissability. When someone gets in a car crash there isn't a % chance that everyone they have been in contact with also gets in a car crash. If everyone who has a virus infects 2 people, and they infect 2 people, and so on, and so on, you see the exponential spread. So it is in our best interest to stop the spread earlier so we have (much) fewer instances of it (which are all further transmissable).</p>
<p>People (on all sides of every argument) also seem to "name-drop" a lot. "Party-Affiliated Politician Mr. Y said such and such so why are you saying something different?" I've been called a "bad-lefty" before because I believe in some things "righties" believe in (in this case it was about freedom of speech). Why do I care if I'm a bad-anything? More importantly, this doesn't prove anything other than humanity's habit of being too tribal. I've come to think: Tribalism provides concensus, not necessarily facts. Skepticism provides facts, not necessarily consensus. Facts are what we need to base our decisions on, imho.</p>
<p>The last point I want to bring up is about personal anecdotes - like your realitive who moved away just-in-time. The problem we all have with letting personal anecdotes sway our opinion is that they are an incomplete picture. For example, for every 1 surly, grumpy old grandpa who gets out just in time, how many surly, grumpy old Grandpa's are there that feared something that never materialized? If everyone moved away when they had a gut-feeling something fishy was going on then you would be able to find lots of people who moved away for nothing. We hear about the times it worked out, we don't hear about the times it didn't because they are unremarkable. "A broken clock is right twice a day."</p>
<p>I've been wrong many times in my life, and it is possible this is another one of those times, but I currently don't think it is. I'm willing to listen (with a genuinely open mind). My hope is that some people here are interested in that kind of interaction. I understand in today's polarized climate it is easy to downvote and move on, but maybe some of us can find a better path forward based on respect, humility in our current views, and appreciation for our shared human experiences.</p>
<p>Kindly, and all imvho.</p>

        <p>Yes it’s totally possible that two things are true. Pharma is greedy and the vaccines work. I didn’t advocate anyone not getting a vaccine. I actually think if you have multiple comorbidity you probably should get the vaccine. I’m deciding to trust my own antibodies. I’m merely pointing out this blind trust in science is ahistorical and strange. I don’t like tribal screeching. What concerns me is a totalitarian pivot to forced medical procedures. I’m concerned a vaccine passport could be turned into a social credit score overnight. </p>
<p>In terms of anecdotes I strongly disagree. Perhaps this is because I think like a journalist not a scientist. Rumors and anecdotes and lies are fascinating. You can learn a lot from them. I think the collective knowledge passed down from your ancestors is valuable. I’m not about to run to the woods, but it’s illustrative that totalitarian governments were a generation ago, and occurring now, and I’m concerned about the current trajectory.</p>

<p>Hateful and dangerous speech can
be banned. And very easily by private companies. Facebook and Twitter are having to do it constantly, every day. </p>
<p>Yes, I’m questioning why Reddit allows your deadly tripe to exist. </p>
<p>Once again, your speech is free until you cross the line of hurting others. You’ve crossed that line killer.</p>

        <p>&rt;I can tell you that Neil DeGrasse Tyson is incredibly kind and thoughtful</p>
<p>Tyson put anti-vaxxers in the same category as flat earthers. See <a href="https://twitter.com/neiltyson/status/1312371036655099907?s=20">his tweet</a></p>
<p>I'm with Tyson on this one.</p>
<p>It seems to me actually having covid would confer stronger immunity than a vaccine. But what do I know?
But if you've had both that would give you more immunity, it seems to me. What's the harm in getting a vaccine even if you've had covid?</p>

        <p>Because I don’t want to take the risk of a new medication for a extremely rare chance of reinfection of what was for me a harmless cold. I choose to be the control group. What’s wrong with that? Why the psychotic attempt to impose uniformity. If you are concerned about unvaccinated variants than please explain why the third world isn’t receiving the vaccines?</p>

        <p>You describe a deplorable situation in the third world.</p>
<p>But even if greed is preventing people in the 3rd world from getting vaccinated, why should I resist getting vaccinated?</p>
<p>I haven't had covid. And I was vaccinated for two reasons:<br>
1) My own protection. <br>
2) Protection of others -- I don't want to be a vector.  </p>
<p>The second reason, eliminating possible disease vectors, justifies strong vaccine efforts in my mind. </p>
<p>What are your feelings on those who haven't had covid? Are you okay with a substantial fraction of the population potentially becoming disease vectors?</p>

        <p>I think if a person wants to take the vaccine, or has comorbidity issues than they should probably take it or take precautionary measures. I’m merely pointing out an insane hypocrisy about supposed concern about the unvaccinated when they aren’t providing the vaccine to the third world. I’m curious why doesn’t the medical community talk about this? Also it’s were human beings not disease vectors, and the vaccinated seem to be spreading this as well. Look at Gibraltar and Israel and Iceland, all places with over 80% vaccination rates it’s still spreading.</p>

        <p>Nope. You’re actually a liar.  I can cite MANY medical professionals speaking out and they haven’t been “fired”.  That’s what we call fake news.  Maybe you should try educating yourself and doing some actual research before making ignorant comments.</p>

        <p>Sorry, calling bullshit on this post.</p>
<p>We've been getting <em>so many</em> of these "I'm pretending to be on your side" posts lately.</p>
<p>I'll give OP credit - this one was very well crafted and actually had me through most of it.</p>
<p>But, like pretty much every single American under the age of 35, you know absolutely <em>nothing</em> about <em>factual</em> history and that was your downfall.</p>
<p>There is absolutely ZERO chance that your "disagreeable asshole grandfather" was living in Poland in 1942 and not <em>already</em> in a camp. Save your "living in the wilderness" stories, that's where they put the mobiles camps. It literally didn't happen.</p>
<p>And how do I know this with such certainty? Oh, I only lived with a Polish holocaust survivor for 2 years and even have an interview with him up on YouTube that I posted here. You can check out if you want.</p>
<p>I'll give you credit, you really did have me for most of this post. But you gave it away with your garbage "historical facts" that are so easily debunked that it disappoints me that I bought into your words up to that point.</p>
<p>You made me feel dumb for a second. But only a second. Sorry, pal, you're not quite smarter than me yet.</p>

        <p>Than it was 41 idk he’s been dead for 20 years. The story is told to me by my father. You are aware there were partisan groups all over Eastern Europe, living in the woods. I went to a synagogue with a woman who lived in the Belski brothers camp. You’re  saying my grandpa made it up and she made it up. Knowing one survivor doesn’t mean you have the entire history of the war. He lived with partisans and that’s how he survived. That’s the story he told his family, corroborated by his two sisters. Glad to know you’re smarter than me, that’s usually what highly intelligent people say lol</p>

        <p>I can tell you with absolute certainty that I am way more aware of what happened during WWII than you'll ever be. That much is obvious.</p>
<p>I was already a WWII historian before living with Saul, but having an <em>actual</em> holocaust survivor to feed you stories...it helps in highlighting just how ridiculously full of shit you are :)</p>
<p>And I know the reason for the post, too. A lot of you bad actors have been pulling it lately. It's the "see? we have an actual real life scientist on our side with some really important information to share!"</p>
<p>And then they tell everyone about your made up grandpa living in the Polish wilderness <em>as late as 194-fucking-2</em> and they're gonna look like total fucking morons to anyone with two brain cells to bounce around in their head. It's the most obvious discrediting play in the playbook. </p>
<p>And I don't concern myself with what "highly intelligent" people say, or what you perceive them to say. Facts are facts, and you've brought zero. Thanks for playing!</p>

        <p>Lol I liked the "history channel documentaries" quote.  I really did. Sounds like something I'd say.</p>
<p>Anyway, you should actually read the articles you cite before citing them. It will really help in you not looking like a liar and a shill. Really.</p>
<p>So if you actually read the article you posted, you'd notice that Jews were actually more or less excluded from these groups due to anti-Semitic and anti-communist beliefs. It was like...literally in the first two paragraphs.</p>
<p>Buddy, I'm trying to help you here. Honestly.</p>
<p>You are <em>way</em> outgunned on this one. I've got way more knowledge than you can even conceive of regarding WWII, and I have <em>real</em> first-hand accounts to bolster the historical facts.</p>
<p>Maybe your grandpa is real and was just full of shit. Given the current circumstances on this sub, that's highly unlikely. You're probably just another misinformation shill.</p>
<p>But yes, if your grandpa is actually real, and you're actually real, then I'm calling your grandpa out on his bullshit. Not just for the time lines. Not just for the circumstances. But a combination of both that makes your story so stupidly impossible, that it's obviously a misinformation campaign.</p>
<p>How are the other bots doing with this, I wonder?</p>

        <p>You just said there were no Jewish resistance groups in the woods, I just showed you a story that you’re wrong. They were mostly excluded, that’s not the same as there were no Jews resisting the occupation. Telling me I’m outgunned, I don’t know it’s the story I was told. You clearly don’t seem to know very much about Eastern European partisan groups when you claimed there weren’t any when there clearly were. I wasn’t there, I can only speak to the fact him and his sisters survived. 🤷🏻‍♂️</p>

        <p>He didn't claim to know more about WW2 than you. I'm not understanding where you're getting off being some supreme source of information on the entirety of WW2 when he was relaying a story about his grandfather. Perhaps you know all about his grandfather and you can tell him everything he doesn't know about him. </p>
<p>It doesn't take much searching to read about Jewish resistance in Poland after 1941, which includes those who fled the ghettos for the forests. </p>
