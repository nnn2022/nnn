    <strong>Need some concrete data</strong>
    <p><p>My ex is adamant about getting my kids (17 &amp;13) vaxed and I do not want them to be. I have pointed out </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Kids don’t get seriously ill from the ‘vid. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kids aren’t major spreaders of the ‘vid. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He said he knows 2 people who died from it. I told him I know someone who died from the vax. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I told him the CDC, not some paranoid conspiracy nuts, is investigating heart problems in kids that get the vax. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He’s worried for his family members who may be at risk being around the kids. I asked if all the family are vaxed, why should they be at risk from the kids? </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>He said he wants to do his own research, not some “Fox news bullshit”. So what resources can you point me to to give to him? Thanks!!</p></p>

<p>I can't answer all of your questions right now. An I don't know if this help but if he prefers his sources from CNN then have them read this post on why people like to use the term pro-approved vaccines. <strong>It is from CNN and written to their high standards.</strong></p>

<p>If you are in Canada then you can use this: "Statistically I feel they are pretty safe. Let me show you why: As of the May 21, 2021 the Government of Canada website reports that for confirmed cases: In the 0-19 age bracket there is a 1.7% chance of hospitalization, 1.2% chance of being admitted to the ICU and a 0.0% chance of dying. "
(https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/epidemiological-summary-covid-19-cases.html#a7) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And this article discusses the low risk covid poses to children:</p>

<p>Hope it helps!</p>

        <p>Honestly, just let your kids decide for themselves without pressure. Give them their own freedom and try not to have either side influence them. That's my advice</p>

        <p>That's good advice. Except this a a co parenting situation. If one wants to make choices with continued consequences, the one that made that choice is the one that handles it. </p>
<p>I doubt that man wants kid duty for two sick teenagers.</p>
