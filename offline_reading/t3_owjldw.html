    <strong>Have you noticed that it‚Äôs not enough to simply be jabbed and masked‚Ä¶you have to enjoy it and believe it!</strong>
    <p><p>Just from browsing Mumsnet, Twitter and Reddit I‚Äôm realising how quickly the virtuous turn on their fellow jab and mask buddies. People who wear a mask but don‚Äôt believe in it or hate masking wearing get whined at. Or people saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had two jabs but I don‚Äôt want any more, it‚Äôs all a bit weird‚Äù get shouted down for being anti-vaxx. I wasn‚Äôt aware that science requires you to believe in it to work! </p>
<p>One of my friends recently stopped talking to me because I suggested that masks aren‚Äôt effective. Have people always got so angry and defensive when others have thoughts? Is thought crime actually going to be a thing soon?</p></p>

        <p>This post from last year is truly depressing reading:</p>
<p>https://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/am_i_being_unreasonable/4026738-To-miss-out-on-this-show-as-I-dont-want-to-wear-a-mask</p>
<p>‚ÄúYABU. Masks are here to stay and tbh you just need to get the fuck over it and wear one. </p>
<p>‚ÄúPlenty of people wear them all day every day with no issues.‚Äù</p>
<p>You don‚Äôt like? good job NHS staff aren‚Äôt so precious in full ppe all day.
Honestly grown adults bleating about I don‚Äôt like, I feel uncomfortableüôÑ‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo definitely don't go you are far too selfish to be allowed to enjoy the company of a show with other people there. 
Don't you watch the news? It isn't safe right now. 
I wear a mask 12 hours a day at work in the NHS and it is no big deal at all, I don't even notice I'm wearing it half the time. You are being ridiculous and a petulant princess.‚Äù</p>
<p>I hate pretty much everyone right now.</p>

        <p>Healthcare staff should be intelligent enough to realise there's a reason they wear masks. Walking down the street or buying groceries isn't the same as caring for sick people or doing things all day which involve strangers' bodily fluids. </p>
<p>For many, wearing a mask during this covid situation has become a asymbol of empathy, or solidarity. It's actually a symbol of unthinking compliance to arbitrary and pointless rules.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if it does what they say it does or not. It doesn't matter if you're immune or vaccinated against the thing it's meant to stop you spreading to others. It doesn't matter if you're even sick or not. They want you to follow orders like they do, and not question them on it, which is the actual issue most of us have with the continued mandate of masks. </p>
<p>Doing stupid things unquestionably, does not make you a good person.</p>

        <p>I noticed that yesterday. Where I am (Asian country) vaccines are still rolling out, and mask laws are strict and honestly need to be followed or the fines are enormous and your legal status in the country will be in jeopardy.</p>
<p>It's not enough that I comply with these rules to keep my job and stay in the country, I should also do so with a big dumb smile on my face and praise our leaders for taking my freedoms away. It's sickening. The worst people here are the other white foreigners that are ready at a moment's notice to bend over and take more of the government's regulatory dick. Fuck them more than anyone else. I won't forget their names or their behavior.</p>

        <p>Ah, that explains it. It was a dictatorship not long ago at all, so I guess I shouldn't be that surprised.</p>
<p>I was just expecting a current dictatorship and one notorious for its control-freakery.</p>

<p>It's funny you should use that phrase, OP, since it's exactly like Big Brother: It's not enough just to <em>submit</em> to him and the party, you have to <em>love</em> Big Brother like Winston and Julia were tortured into doing.</p>
<p>And that's a comparison I've made to the new abnormal before.</p>
