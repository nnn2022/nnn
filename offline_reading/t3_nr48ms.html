    <strong>How to obtain consciousness to bring back the old ways of life</strong>
    <p><p>(1) <strong>Subvert your expectations of reality.</strong> We believe that systems of power are here to deceive us, but in reality, the deceptions lie within each of our own biases and failure to trust one another. We spend so much time cancelling the beliefs of each other that we fail to see elements of truth that lie in within what we dismissed. Is the media full of crooks? Yeah. But it's full of people who want to spread truth and help society as well.  </p>
<p>(2<strong>) Embrace unity.</strong> The reality you experience isn't the reality of your brothers and sisters, and division is only separating our realities. We need to accept that a return to the "old ways" will be filled with COVID believers and non-believers. We must listen to one another and love one another. We shouldn't push our ways of thinking on others, just as others shouldn't push their ways of thinking on us. Passive resistance and love is the way to create a shared consciousness of truth.</p>
<p>(3) <strong>Continually grow.</strong> We need to gain further education and expand our minds. Seek a liberal arts college. There will be folk against you at first, but once they see your willingness to create unity, you all will come to a shared understanding of reality and truth. Love and listening are the only ways forward.</p></p>
