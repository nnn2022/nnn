    <strong>18+Reasons Why Not To Take The mRNA Vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>With Astra-Zeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson being suspended all over the world, people have to read this piece before they make their choice: <a href="https://www.deconstructingconventional.com/post/18-reason-i-won-t-be-getting-a-covid-vaccine">https://www.deconstructingconventional.com/post/18-reason-i-won-t-be-getting-a-covid-vaccine</a></p>
<p>I have been sharing this piece with great success with people either asking me if I am getting the vaccine.  Usually, I share this, and then let them make their own choices. But, I am making sure they see this.    Bottom line, you can't rush a vaccine, and this vaccine is more akin to GENE THERAPY than a traditional vaccine.  Buyer beware.</p>
<p><strong>What should have happened</strong>, is that only the vulnerable population should have been urged to get vaccinated, and not the general healthy population. We should be leaving young and healthy people alone till ample testing is done.   Furthermore, COVID vaccines should always be a choice, just like the flu vaccine.  No Covid passports, and no right of passage to any business, school, or church.</p></p>
