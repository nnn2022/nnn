    <strong>The recent CDC Proclamation on masks is meant to re-kindle conflict and confusion</strong>
    <p><p>So the CDC officially declared that those who have taken the experimental biotechnology called a vaccine, and only those who have done so, may now resume public life sans masks. The CDC is an unelected and unaccountable agency, yet their Proclamations, which they label “recommendations,” are immediately enshrined as the de facto law of the land. </p>
<p>Consider how much conflict and confusion arise due to the clear exclusion of those who have not taken the novel biotechnologies from the privilege of liberation from the state-enforced dress code. A situation is arising in which revelation of one’s private medical information to anyone, anywhere, will be outright compelled by force, or it considered highly suspicious not to offer without hesitation. </p>
<p>So two colleagues, unmasked, decide to talk to one another. One, sane, is relieved that—he presumes—everyone around him is too polite not to really ask about whether he has taken any experimental medical interventions lately, and so he can finally take off this silly rag; surely people are not so boorish and rude. Two, who did participate in the experiment, asks One: you’re vaccianted, right? </p>
<p>Two declines to answer: surprised; “I would prefer not to answer that.”</p>
<p>Use your mind to see just how this situation could echo in further and escalating conflict. </p>
<p>I believe this advice was timed surgically to re-invigorate the hyper-present dynamism of conflict, which had been evaporating as Americans (and other nationalities!) were beginning to heal from the last fifteen months of psychological torture and demoralization. </p>
<p>We are in the midst of a war on Human Consciousness.</p></p>
