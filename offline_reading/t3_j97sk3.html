    <strong>Missing In Action - Corona Edition</strong>
    <p><p>Eight months and counting. Our societies are frozen in a dystopian stasis, like Han Solo trapped in Carbonite.</p>
<p>In the past, there were certain "squeaky wheel" groups that would be expected to push back on this type of thing - whether for their own self-interested reasons, or for some, on grounds of principle. </p>
<p>I'm referring to:</p>
<p>- <strong>The legal profession</strong>. Where the hell are the lawyers? Given their usual desire for financial enrichment and public notice, why are there not a thousand discrimination and rights violations cases in our courts right now?  These guys will literally defend a male "trans" who brings a "human rights" case against female aestheticians who won't give him a bikini wax on his nuts! <em>I know there are a few cases ongoing, but the majority are silent. Why?</em></p>
<p>- <strong>"Civil rights advocates"</strong> . See above. They will ensure you are forced to bake a wedding cake against your will, but are MIA when it comes to the violation of rights of association, speech, movement, and accommodation of disabilities occurring under the banner of "public health" - <em>which is affecting our already disadvantaged citizens most!</em></p>
<p>- <strong>The unions</strong>. Millions of their dues-paying members are languishing at home, and those sweet monthly deposits into union funds don't come from people who are furloughed, laid off, or out of a job completely. Businesses are evaporating left and right, and the "work from home" culture will inevitably lead to another round of job offshoring. <em>Don't these guys care, if for no other reason than naked self-interest?</em></p>
<p>In short, the organizations that have historically stood up for those with no voice are silent. Even though these days they do it more out of self-interest than altruism, when it comes to the ScamDemic, I consider these organizations to fall under the banner of "The enemy of my enemy, is my friend".</p>
<p>So once again... <em>Why are they silent???</em></p></p>

        <p>There's a lot of truth to that.</p>
<p>Perhaps their silence isn't so much cowardice, it's the fact that many of them are making bank off of other people's misery.</p>
<p>Not to mention that life under a "lockdown" is a whole lot different if you live in a 55-room palace, have domestic servants to shop, fetch, and carry for you, the best in food and booze - and have the financial resources to travel and access entertainment even with increased prices and mandatory quarantine periods.</p>
<p>Many of them are so far removed from reality that they think the draconian measures in place are just "a minor inconvenience" to <em>everyone</em> - because that is how <em>they</em> are affected.</p>

        <p>canada has 'lawyers'? the usa has only 'attorneys'</p>
<p>there are no 'courts of law' in the usa, only 'star chambers', rebranded as 'statutory courts, divided into various levels and subject matter jurisdictions. 'lawyers' are barred from them, only 'attorneys' are permitted. </p>
<p>'public health', the word 'public' in legalese means 'government'. so called 'public health' means government health. what is 'health' to the government? it is power and control, more of these equates to health.</p>
<p>unions are a scam</p>
<p>none of these 'organizations' were ever on 'your' side</p>
<p>government agents and minions do not work for you!</p>

        <p>Quaintly, most Canadian "legal professionals" still use the old British nomenclature of "Barristers and Solicitors". But, as a group, they are the same "hive of scum and villainy" as you have in the States.</p>
<p>We have our "Star Chambers" here, referred to as "Human Rights Tribunals" - where the truth is no defence, there is no concept of reasonable doubt or innocent until proven guilty, the complainant has free legal support while the accused has to pay for it out of pocket, and massive, life-ruining sanctions can be imposed.</p>
<p>In short, the process is the punishment. And it is used ruthlessly to silence dissent.</p>
<p>I'm well aware that none of the organizations I mentioned are a citizen's "friend".</p>

        <p>I'd add musicians to this list. We had rock and roll, punk, we had metal, we even had classical composers like Beethoven who wrote pieces against the Napoleon occupation of Vienna or Shostakovich who was persecuted by the USSR under Stalin. Other than Van Morrison, where are the big name, influential bands standing up against the tyranny?  It may seem like a minor thing but music is important.</p>

<p>A set of boobs or a six-pack selling themselves for lucre. Auto-tune wonders cranking out noise that is the musical equivalent of the endless superhero dreck we see in the theatres.</p>
<p>They will scream about "standing up to the man", as long as the man is Orange, and mouth their approval for whatever the cause-du-jour is: climate change, starving kids in Africa, pacifism, "fuk da poleeeeece".</p>
<p>But individuality, freedom, gratitude for their riches and fame? Never, that wouldn't be cool!</p>
<p>And before you accuse me of "yelling at clouds", I listen to everything from punk, to metal, to industrial, opera, classical, jazz, folk music...</p>

        <p>I'm in Canada as well.</p>
<p>I fear the pushback is too little, too late.</p>
<p>Where I live, 95+ percent of the population didn't wear masks back in the March-April period where the narrative was "Millions are going to die!!!!!!!" So they obviously didn't want to wear masks, and didn't see the need to do so.</p>
<p>Now that we have a mandatory mask mandate, 95+ percent wear the mask. You can't tell me that all of a sudden, as the death rates trend to zero, that the NPCs suddenly all thought "Gee, <em>now</em> it's a good idea to don a face diaper - millions <em>aren't</em> dying like they said they would!"</p>
<p>They are doing it because Mommy tells them to. Full stop. It's pure and simple cowardice.</p>
