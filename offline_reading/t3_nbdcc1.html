    <strong>Long term effects of exposure to covid spike proteins</strong>
    <p><p>What do you all think of these items?</p>
<p>&rt;Gene changes might explain long-haul COVID-19 symptoms</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>“We found that exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein alone was enough to change baseline gene expression in airway cells,”</strong></p>
<p>https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-04/eb-gcm041621.php</p>
<p>&rt;COVID-19 mRNA vaccines give instructions for our cells to make a harmless piece of what is called the “spike protein.” The spike protein is found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19.</p>

        <p>Look, we cannot even be certain it is spike proteins, because they have not even properly isolated the virus. They have no clue how such alleged virus would look like, genetically. They completely faked the genome, based on a computer model, in silico, and on the also non-isolated SARS genome. It's like a puzzle of a 1000 pieces, and put it back together, randomly, and say it's done: the genome.</p>
<p>Meaning: the question is: what is REALLY being coded for in these vaccines... That is the big topic that is being deflected, very cleverly, by all the talks  about one in a million blood clots.</p>

        <p>I know it's still a conspiracy theory, but the sterlization angle has a lot going for it. Or shorten life-span, somehow. I didn't believe in the depopulation agenda myself, especially not with that ineffective bioweapon they say is covid, lol. But now, I have to reconsider, with the genetic vaccine stuff. Research GENE DRIVE technology. It can be used to make species extinct.</p>
<p>The vaccines could also be to induce general morbidity in the population, which imho is the real goal of the traditional vaccines, we will see only in the coming years. Future tells past. Overall though, it is a huge step in the medical control society, which is another agenda which is completely aligned with vaccine tyranny. This will eventually lead to the implanted health chip, connected to your bank account, which is the Mark of the Beast. That's where we are going, and many of us will likely see this 2000 year old biblical prophecy come true. It's up to the sharp ones to recognize the implications of this, and what is the truth in this world.</p>

        <p>Interesting.  I did Google gene drive technology, as you suggested.  Some of these people are just crazy.  Killing off all mosquitos? They can't possibly know what effect that would have.  I would imagine it would be disastrous. For example, male mosquitos are pollinators.</p>

        <p>"They" see us as a cancer to the planet, "a virus" (matrix quote), useless eaters. </p>
<p>If they can convince the sheeple to sterilize themselves, voluntarily, that's a huge victory for them. They love to make us sin ourselves, not force us, or do the sin themselves, but let us agree on it. It absolves them from the crime in their mind, and confirms their intellectual superiority over the blind masses.</p>

<p>It's not impressive biblical prophecy because for one they aren't specific at all, and two it is no great feat of prediction to say men in power will want to brand humans. We've been branding cattle for thousands of years before Bible was written, and been branding slaves in one fashion or another since the practice of slavery was started. Now if Bible had said they would put a piece of metal under your skin and it would contain your information and always know where you are, that would be pretty fucking impressive.</p>

        <p>It is EXTREMELY impressive, you unbeliever. This is 2000 year old prophecy, coming true in our days, with vastly different technology than then.</p>
<p>Revelation 13:
And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:
And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</p>
<p>In sweden they tested chips in the hand. Musk's Neuralink latest product is the 0.9 version of the chip, which is now implantable. The much reporterd 2020060606 (666) patent refers to connecting a biosensor, aka chip, to a cryptocurrency system. Aka money. To buy and sell. </p>
<p>This is AMAZINGLY accurately describing the Mark of the Beast, you fool. Nobody can deny the truth Bible, anyone who does is not informed enough, does not see through all the lies on earth, or is an agent. No other options. Choose.</p>

        <p>I just explained why it's not impressive. They are vague and do not give any hint of knowledge beyond what their ignorant, savage ways knew at the time. Literally anyone could predict men of power would want to control and brand as many humans as he could, and to eventually kill the unbranded. Impressive would be describing the workings of microchips and modern technology. But they don't because Bible was not divinely written. You might as well go get the vax because they are both believed in and trusted based on no compelling, falsifiable evidence.</p>

        <p>Just like a religious person to resort to ad hominen attacks. There's no compelling, falsifiable evidence for the supernatural or god. There are no prophecies in the book of fables that are beyond what the men of that time were capable of knowing. You might as well start wearing masks with the other sheep.</p>
