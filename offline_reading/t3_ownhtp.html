    <strong>At what point do you think people will take up arms and actually fight against the government?</strong>
    <p><p>Were seeing governemnts becoming more authoritarian by the day and it's pretty clear to most people that it's no longer about fighting the coof but establishing more control over the population. In response were seeing growing protests all around the world bu the politicians seem to ignore them. Do you think the protests will eventually escalate into mass scale violence/civil war or will people get tired and submit?</p></p>

        <p>No. If these things happened in the 80s or earlier theres a chance. People nowadays were groomed to be compliant. They taught us that inoder to survive this system you need to follow bureaucracies like licensing, regulations, authorizations, certifications, codes, standardization, approvals etc.</p>
<p>Most of armed rebellions happen in third world countries with "backward culture" where people still struggle on daily basis inoder to eat. Its their survival instincts that feeds them and their families. They know they have to fight  to live. It is the struggle to fight that gives meaning to their lives. In progressive western countries it is the regulators that dictate how you live your life and approve your livelihood.</p>

        <p>Yes i think we are moving to that credit score system. Ive been listening to rob braxman in youtube. Hes a tehnology expert in data privacy and he said its fully implemented. We sre still safe he said as long as they can't link our data like comments and post to our real identity. So better not  mention any specifics about you online. Your real email ad should be clean and isolated</p>

<p>Sorry, but I have been sick of people in this sub clinging to hope, optimism, and prayer since 2020. "I prayed to God that this will end, and He hasn't failed me yet! LOL! :D" So sick of this shit. </p>
<p>If you want this to end, we need to promote real protests (and not just a group of people chanting with signs up and down a random street.......) and other meaningful means of mass civil disobedience. Otherwise, it's game over, and just shut up and accept the upcoming Great Reset.</p>

        <p>It's a difficult question, maybe THE question of our lives. Normally when something like this happens, usually in another country, it was fairly easy to predict the course based on past events. But in this case I see one fundamental difference, in that the oppression isn't real for most people in any real sense. We have all seen a bunch of craziness on TV riots and so forth, but unlike events of the past for most of us it's just a TV show. I think the lockdowns and mass hysteria over a bad flu are key here. As long as they can keep you in the house and on the Xbox or the computer instead of regularly engaging in normal life...Well they have enough control over the social media conversation to convince people of anything. But, to answer your question I think it's just a matter of time that all this will end with a whimper not a bang. In fact, I already see it, I currently live near the downtown of an inner city and for real now people aren't complying with the bs, nobody is wearing masks people are done with this horseshit. It's going to end like the phone company ended after cell phones came out.</p>

        <p>Christ I hope you are right, but governments across the globe have in an orchestrated manner turned outright evil and threatening in a way as unseen in our lifetimes as you say, something bigger than even big is happening. Is there any turning back once the cat is out of the bag on this?</p>

        <p>They haven't turned, they have shown who they really are to a new generation, whether that new generation is currently prepared to accept it or not. And this time they only killed several thousand with their misinformation instead of tens of millions before the lies became apparent so I guess we're making progress.</p>

        <p>I agree with your point that they are just doing this to a new generation. This is an incredibly scary realisation that will not leave us ever. </p>
<p>About making progress, I'm not so sure. If this continues, it will make the past atrocities toward humanity seem like childs play. This isn't just and assault on our lives, it feels like an assault on our very souls.</p>

        <p>I know what you mean, I often feel the same way. But then I remember,  this is half the population at least, it's probably a lot more no matter how much CNN claims blocking election observers is somehow not totalitarian. We really need a new platform and actual leadership to make things better, but no, I just am not worried that these people will actually be able to destroy America. Our founders foresaw sh!+ like this and purposely made change take a long time knowing lies always come out given a little time.</p>

        <p>I doubt your as old as me but my observation about these commys in the school system for example is this, and I'm not talking about all of them but the ones pushing this stuff...These are the mostly girls who couldn't leave the party scene in the 80- 90's . Next thing they know they are working at fast food and are no longer good looking enough to be invited as ornaments to the coke party. So, they had a moment of clarity,  got a Pell grant, and went to community College at age 36. Now six years later they think they know something after meeting some Marxist professor and are teaching your kids. That's the facts unfortunately.</p>

        <p>I honestly think it would take a lot for that to happen. While many Americans may share the same views and beliefs, we're too spread out. </p>
<p>Sure, you might have hundreds or thousands here and there. But the military can break that up easily. </p>
<p>It would be different if there were 10's of thousands in a single place. Have movement after movement. Shifts. So on.</p>
<p>Travel, to organize something large would be hard, because everyone suspected as being involved would be shut down at the airport, leaving roads being the primary means of transportation. I doubt a majority of people have a car that can drive through multiple states, let alone one.</p>
<p>There would also need to be funding. People gotta eat. </p>
<p>As much as I like the idea of an American population willing to fight for their freedoms, I just don't see how it would be possible in any lasting way.</p>
<p>Something that could make a difference would be state national guards teaming up with militias. That could provide the resources needed, to last more than a day or two.</p>
<p>But, to answer your question, a us military convoy arriving at my house, or any foreign military patrolling US streets, would be the line crossing of personal threat to me.</p>

        <p>People saying it's not possible to fight the government. I would disagree.</p>
<p>Fire alone is a hell of a weapon. Lots of fire is downright terrifying. It's not hard to make a lot of fires quickly, overwhelming emergency resources instantly. These diverted and split resources could then be overwhelmed by an assault so that the fires continue to rage with no help in sight. How many of these type of events would need to happen before local law enforcement and emergency services would quit Covid enforecement en masse.</p>
<p>And this is just one scenario. There are hundreds of others that could be equally devastating. </p>
<p>Of course, fire storming entire cities is an ugly scenario and nobody wants to see this. But, people, they are coming to give each of us the killshot by force!!! </p>
<p>Whenever and however the people decide to handle this, know that we are, and will always be, fully justified!!! It is by their provocation, not ours, that decisions like these will have to be made!</p>
