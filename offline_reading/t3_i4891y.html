<p>Looking at the actual data, kids are for all intents and purposes immune from this.  Yet we traumatize them and psychologically scar them because... reasons?  It's certainly not based on anything logical, that's for sure.</p>

        <p>It's child abuse. Imagine dressing your kid up in a mask at this time last year - people would call you crazy and say your kid will be mentally scarred. It's no different now, except that the government is encouraging the abuse.</p>

        <p>I watch a youtuber who happens to be Asian. At the very beginning of this, when nobody else was worried, she was sending her kids to school in masks and wearing them everywhere, even in her car. People automatically assumed she and the kids had covid because why else would they wear masks? They all ended up being bullied and harassed for wearing the masks as well as being Asian (which is fucking disgusting, don't get me wrong. The point is a few months ago Asians were catching all sorts of shit for wearing them from the same reddit mob who are now trying to force it onto everyone.)</p>

        <p>while this is a great meme, it is also important to remember, that even before the dystopian fakedemic measures were put in place to torture children on a whole new level, sending your children to a public school is still horrible for them.</p>
<p>u are literally giving up your child and putting them into the hands of government, where they can indoctrinate and torture them for 8 hours.</p>
<p>imagine, if i came home to u and asked u, if u would please give me your child every day for 8 hours  alone for something.</p>
<p>u would obviously say no! u would question  who i was, how i dare to even ask for this and maybe call the police expecting intentions of abuse and child trafficking.</p>
<p>so why is it ok, when the government is demanding this from u? well it isn't of course, but u have been indoctrinated to think, that this is "normal" and ok.</p>
<p>if public schools were actually about education, then  a parent would be expected to be allowed to  stay near the child, while a teacher teaches them like in the same room, but talking with other parents on a table or doing some work, so that they can oversee any education and make sure, that their child isn't getting abused.</p>
<p>leaving a young child alone in a school would then only happen after some a few months went by and the parent trust the teacher somewhat and other parents would still be in the room to make sure, that the child is not alone, preferably other parents, that the parent and child already knows and trusts.</p>
<p>the child would also be told, that when the parent isn't there,  that they can tell the teacher or other parent, that a parent should come and get them and it would happen instantly usually.</p>
<p>of course none of this is done, because it is not about the health of children or education, it is all about  torture, mind control/indoctrination to get good slaves, who will blindly follow authority  and don't question the lies, that they got told at school and later in life by authority figures.</p>
<p>if u love your child, do anything possible to NOT letting them get tortured in public schools.</p>
<p>there is homeschooling, good private schools like steiner schools, montessori schools  or waldorf schools, etc...</p>
<p>creating schooling groups with your  friends, who u trust, who also got children and homeschool through those groups,  which massively reduces time requirement and also has some other benefits.</p>
<p>again whatever u do, DON'T throw your child into a public indoctrination/torture camp called public schools, don't let your beautiful spark get destroyed in such a place of horror.</p>
<p>and of course fight the current insanity, that they are already pushing into public schools!</p>
