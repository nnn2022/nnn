    <strong>Covid is just the warm-up for Climate Change. The similarities will be endless.</strong>
    <p><p>As I write from Germany, in the same region as most of the serious flooding but situated well above the slightly-flooded river in my small valley town, I can now clearly foresee the climate change agenda, based largely on the continuing covid hysteria.</p>
<p>"Time to impose speed limits on the U-Bahn." is a comment I just read on the FT.com website. If we shame ordinary people hard enough, and limit all their activities, the weather will surely improve.</p>
<p>In the same way as covid propaganda relies on localised outbreaks, sob stories and distorted stats to generate fear, outrage and depression, the climate "crisis" will be sold to the gullible masses via a series of scary weather events around the globe, with tragic tales and disingenuous charts.</p>
<p>Covid is a real virus that does real harm to some people but poses little threat to the general population, yet governments have mostly escaped blowback after imposing vastly disproportionate measures. Climate change is also real, will do real harm to communities and wider regions, and yes, a similarly disproportionate response will mean far greater authoritarianism.</p>
<p>Growing societal division with everyone having a strong opinion on very specialist topics, and almost all experts towing the line to preserve their status and income. If you thought this was bad during covid, hold onto your hats as the strong winds, hurricanes, floods, hail, heat and snow start to hit randomly across all timezones. You might also notice that discussions of race, gender, religion, immigration and conflict (ongoing or potential) keep getting more bewildering. A perfect storm for the ruling class, whose priority to to keep us from discussing gross inequality in the logical way (leading to conclusions of socialism or barbarism).</p>
<p>Simply put, transitioning to a post-carbon economy, whether patiently or urgently, requires precisely zero direct control over the activity of working class people. It can be done entirely by managing levers of the economy. You have to order airports to cut back operations, car manufacturers to scale down production, and producers of most everyday items to just stop churning out all that disposable and unhealthy crap. Then deal with the consequences of high unemployment in sensible ways. It's actually a lot easier than trying to micromanage the general population from sunrise to sunset.</p>
<p>When governments inevitably make the new climate rules, with climate lockdowns and climate credits for every man, woman and child, it should be obvious to all that -- as with covid -- this is all about a New Normal, not the health or safety of the population.</p></p>

        <p>The Rockefellers have a big obsession with climate lockdowns. I think the Rockefellers feel guilty because their wealth comes from oil. So they're trying to compensate for it through climate lockdowns.</p>

        <p>Yes. And CNN will lead the MSM brigade just like they said they would. </p>
<p>It's all very clever when people dont pay attention.</p>
<p>Powerful people have duped the masses into trusting them based on credentials of those that came before them. Real scientists now provide the wave for frauds to exploit. Real companies with long history are infiltrated, yet again like a host organism is with a virus.</p>
<p>And the people think that sacrificing is for the greater good. One could argue it is the opposite, as the more people acquiesce the worse things will be for the very future people we are supposedly saving the planet for.</p>
<p>It's a sick joke. Truly. And I so wish for a place carved out where like minded people can have old petrol vehicles, cheap coal energy, and normal problems with sensical solutions. But of course that just cant be allowed.</p>

        <p>Since Scott Morrison became Prime Minister of Australia in 2018 I started learning way too much about the dark side of politics and realised something crucial to the wellbeing of everyday people; they only care about keeping the balance sheet in the black, and debt and deficit is great!</p>
