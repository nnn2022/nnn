    <strong>How the fuck are we "selfish" if we're willing to lose our jobs and reputations over this shit!? The only reason you view us as selfish is because you literally can't comprehend that we are fighting for something bigger than ourselves, you myopic, toadying, solipsistic shit-sacks.</strong>
    <p><p>So many fucking reasons not to get the jab, fucking countless, and yet apperantely we're all just afraid of needles and we're all 5G conspiracy nuts (despite never having seen anyone bring that fucking shit up in a serious manner). For the thousandth time, here are some of the reasons we are refusing the clot-shot and standing our ground against increasingly fascist measures meant to grind us down and force us into submission:</p>
<p><strong>It's experimental. I will not be a lab rat.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It's more rushed than Cyberpunk2077 (and just as buggy).</strong></p>
<p><strong>I am not at risk from the virus and anyone that fucking is has either had the heckin' jab by now or is so immunocompromised they live in a bubble and won't come into contact with me anyway. Also that last group would be discriminated against should a vaccine passport system come into place. FUCKING ABLEIST HYPOCRITES.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It was only approved for emergency use only and isn't FDA approved (not that that means much and it won't fucking change many people's minds once it is as they're probably fucking compromised).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Some (if not all) of the manufacturers have shady pasts, dodgy dealings and multiple lawsuits under their belt. Also you can't sue them if anything goes tits up. They're not liable.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The virus has a 99.9% (or there abouts) survival rate. No one I know has died with it, no one I know KNOWS anyone that's died with it, and everyone that's had it described it as a bad flu, if that.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The narrative and goalposts are constantly changing. They promised you you could stop wearing masks if you got vaccinated, and now they've turned around and shat all over that promise. Also, those who got the AstraZeneca clot-shot have been left hanging out to dry as the EU vaccine passport excludes them. GUTTED.</strong></p>
<p><strong>All of the adverse side effects and deaths reported to VAERS, the media (when they bother to report it) and social media. I know plenty of people who have felt like absolute dog-shit after their jabs, and one of my friends almost fucking died from it. Not for me, thanks.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In relation to the above, all of the censorship and outright denial surrounding these reports. The CovidVaccinated mods deleted more than half of the negative posts, got rid of the Bad Side Effects flair and banned users who persisted in trying to get help and share their story. Morally fucking repugnant.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Just how fucking hard the government and media is pushing this shit is enough to make me skeptical, particuarly when you take into account how they have acted this past year and a half. I do not like being blackmailed, coerced, shamed or threatened into doing anything against my will. Stuff your free doughnuts up your arse.</strong></p>
<p><strong>No long term studies. Enough said.</strong></p>
<p><strong>All of our "conspiracy theories" such as vaccine passports and mask mandates have come true. I think I'll wait out this Winter to see if the ADE theory holds any water.</strong></p>
<p><strong>More and more booster shots will be required to keep your "fully vaccinated" status. It's not two shots and you're done. This isn't going away any time soon if you let it carry on.</strong></p>
<p><strong>And last but not least, FUCK YOU, my body, my fucking choice, that's why.</strong></p>
<p>I'm probably missing a Hell of a lot more but you get the gist.</p></p>

        <p>You listed many good arguments, but your last one is all that matters. I won’t surrender my right to bodily autonomy. This doesn’t make me selfish. Valuing the rights of the individual is the foundation of this country. We fold on this at our peril. Once they can mandate medical procedures nothing is off the table.</p>

        <p>I feel like that may have already happened when we got a break in the masks and lockdowns lol.

        <p>Moron. How is that giving away bodily autonomy? Nothing is going inside your body. No one is shoving inside anything there with force. You can claim it as "no right" to drink and drive but bodily autonomy is not lost. Covidians cannot comprehend basic things. But then again they mask up for an airborne virus through which they are able to breathe in and breathe out. Lowest tier gene pool fuckers.</p>

        <p>Abstaining from an action in an agreed upon cause and effect scenario is fundamentally different than subjecting oneself to a hysteric and arguably esoteric action at the request of authority and social pressure.</p>
<p>A closer analogy would be if everyone was forced to retroactively install breathalyzer  locks onto their cars, and they are forever banned or limited from driving until they do.</p>
<p>That reflects the elements of:</p>
<ol>
<li>An assumption of guilty until proven innocent</li>
<li>Retroactive modification of personal property</li>
<li>Blanket application over an entire population</li>
<li>Top down monitoring system that creeps on user privacy</li>
<li>Centralized monopoly on population's autonomy</li>

        <p>Please enlighten me for I am but a simple covidiot nutjob: how is my refusal to take an experimental treatment for a virus I already had and recovered from without the need for any medication, a treatment that is meant ease my symptoms should I get sick but in no way makes me less susceptible to getting sick or spreading it to others, how is that in any way, shape or form comparable to endangering other people's lives by driving drunk? And how exactly would vulnerable people benefit from me making a decision that only affects me?</p>

        <p>100% this. I am on the side of fundamentally believing that the vaccine basically does what it claims to do, that is that it isn't some crazy Bill Gates microchip Trojan horse, and it probably does increase your resistance to Covid somewhat. But I have never gotten the annual flu shot and no one has ever harassed or insulted me about it. The cost/benefit has never been there for me. Do I want a very high chance of feeling a little bit bad for a couple days, or a very small chance of feeling quite bad for a few days? I don't know. But either way, it's my damn choice! It's the autocratic bullying of all this that has me absolutely refusing to get the shot at this point, out of principle alone.</p>

        <p>They can bloody well try. You noticed how the past year they've issued impotent threats but nothing else? If they could have forced us into anything unconstitutional then they would have already, but they won't even dare to try because the constitution (that's every democratic country's constitution) has our PUBLIC SERVANTS bent over a barrel. That's why knowledge of our constitutional rights is kept hush hush and scoffed at when brought up.</p>
<p>An educated citizen is bulletproof. Every man, woman, and child who's against tyranny ought to learn the difference between their legal rights (few and far between) and lawful rights (constitutional - highest law of the land) and commit the knowledge to memory.</p>

        <p>I think you can be against both vaccine mandates <em>and</em> legal abortion, given that the former is only the possibility of exposing someone to a virus which is very survivable and the latter is directly ending a human life.</p>
<p>I don't think you can possibly maintain internal consistency however if you are both pro-choice for reasons of bodily autonomy and pro-vaccine mandate.</p>

        <p>yeah im pro-choice on both (STRONGLY in fact) but i think there are two somewhat morally consistent positions:  </p>
<ol>
<li>anti-mandate and pro-choice: "my body my choice"</li>
<li>anti-mandate and anti-abortion: "abortion is direct murder"</li>

<p>the third position, pro-mandate and anti-abortion that a lot of leftists occupy, just isn't coherent in the slightest.</p>

        <p>I think to deny responsibility for a human being in the womb is to deny the biological reality of reproduction and natural differences between men and women. We know what sex causes. It's not my business if people have irresponsible sex, but I do care about killing defenseless human beings(another difference between an unborn baby and a compromised born person as they could stay home, wear an n95, or get a vaccine while the unborn cannot help their location or biological dependency due to someone elses choices).</p>

        <p>Time to get the facts straight: If you are not in a group with especially high risk and you <em>do</em> get the vaccine, you are putting others at risk. You don't need it, and you getting vaccinated drives the evolution of the virus towards variants that will be resistant to the vaccination. You are making the vaccine inefficient for people who might rely on it, people die because of you. Pretty selfish.</p>

        <p>How is that when once you get it, you are contagious only the week or so after first symptoms and up to 2 days before and once you build up natural antibodies to it, you’re no longer contagious?</p>
<p>The complete time they say one can be infected is 10-15 days. You don’t have Covid indefinitely.</p>
<p>If you’re sick, you’re not out marching and exhausting yourself because no one I know that’s sick what’s to do anything but lay in the bed, myself included.</p>
<p>I’m not getting dressed to go out and eat or protest when I have a fever, feel like shit and have diarrhea. </p>
<p>After two weeks, you will have survived it, and gained some shiny new antibodies as well to fight in the future.</p>

        <p>And the main stream media has convinced a chunk of people that the opposite is true. That we are the ones who are putting other's at danger simply by existing. I am not forcing anyone to come near me that does not want to. I will wear a badge at this point showing my pride for not being gullible enough to believe a trillion dollar industry when they say, just trust us our product bro. </p>
<p>Taking these vaccines when they provide a 50/50 chance of stopping the transmission, which is the same as a placebo by the way, is extremely short sighted and dangerous. </p>

        <p>vaccines dont drive the evolution of the virus. its the unvaccinated hosts that do that. people with no antibodies or built up immunity allow for the virus to spread and evolve within that host and others around them. someone getting vaccinated does not make the vaccine less efficient. you clearly have no idea what youre talking about lmao</p>

        <p>like this reasoning is correct. leaky vaccines are a problem. the solution now isnt to stop getting vaccinated. the solution is for as many people who can get vaccinated to do so so we can prevent the spread of the stronger virus to ppl who cant get vaxxed. like so much of the US population is vaxxed already so this possibility of vaxxed individuals creating a stronger virus isnt going away we need more peoppe vaccinated so this isnt an issue</p>

        <p>I'm not conceding anything, this was my position from the start. We're not all a hivemind you know.</p>
<p>The vaccine <em>is</em> risky, and we clearly don't know much about the after-effects yet. But at some point, that risk becomes smaller than the risk of dying of COVID. I'm in favor of vaccinating people over the age of 55 and anyone else in risk groups (such as airway problems). Only with consent, of course.</p>
<p>But when you start injecting children with an experimental vaccine even though the children have an almost 0% chance of dying from COVID anyway, that's completely unacceptable.</p>

        <p>Hi, this is not right. The cance of a new variant developing is directly proportional to the number of copies of the virus, more copies, higher chance of mutation in one of the copies. This diversification of the virus is what we are woried about, not the selection. If more people get the vaccine there will be fewer copies of the virus about, and less chance of new varients comming up.</p>

        <p>&rt;who do become infected</p>
<p>meaning like for like infections are caused by like amounts of the virus, but those infections are much less likely for the vaccinated. I also don't understand your other links, they are NOT suggesting leaving the birds unvaccinated is a better option, it pretty clearly states that in the US instead of using vaccines they cull, obviously this is not what you are suggesting. </p>
<p>Look you don't need to trust me at all to get this, evolution is by RANDOM mutation and natural selection. The clue is in the name. SELECTION pressure or not, vaccine or not, the mutations are random, each copy has some chance of being a mutant, less copies means less mutants. Obviously if everyone were vaccinated the only varients that could spread and survive wouldn't be covered by the vaccine, but those varients are more likely to randomly appear through RANDOM mutations if more copies of the virus are about either from more infected people or more viruses per infection. Both of these are reduced by vaccination.</p>

        <p>There are two parts to evolution: random mutation and natural selection. If you apply a pressure to a mature species (like humans) there is enough diversity from previous mutations for the mean of the population to shift in the direction of the pressure (which naturally also reduces the diversity of the population). For a virus with only 5 varients, there is not enough diversity in the population for this to work. But, if we allow the virus to infect many people the diversity of it's population will gradually increase as with any living thing, the chance of a new mutation happening is proportional to the number of copies of the virus (as each copy has a chance of messing up). If you get vaccinated, fewer copies will be made in your body if you become infected, as your immune system has a 'head start' fighting the virus.</p>

<p>&rt;In contrast, vaccinal Abs are directed at a limited set of S-derived Sars-CoV-2 motifs (i.e., epitopes primarily comprised within the receptor-binding domain [RBD] of the S protein). Hence, very few mutations within this limited set of epitopes will already substantially diminish the affinity of vaccinal Abs for binding to Sars-CoV-2. This, however, does not apply to S-specific Abs acquired upon recovery from natural Covid-19 disease as those are directed at a much broader and diversified spectrum of B cell epitopes. This would already explain why more infectious Sars-CoV-2 variants more readily escape from vaccinal S-specific Abs than from naturally acquired S-specific Abs and also why we are now seeing more and more breakthrough disease cases with the more infectious delta variant in vaccinees whereas young and/ or healthy individuals or previously symptomatically infected people (provided seronegative for S protein (3)) remain largely protected from Covid-19 disease.</p>
<p>&rt;Molecular epidemiologists conclude that, because of the steadily increasing S-directed immune pressure exerted by the human population, circulating variants are now increasingly evolving mutations that drive resistance to S-specific Abs, especially to those recognizing immunodominant epitopes that are situated within the RBD and N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S protein. It is highly unlikely that naturally acquired S-specific Abs are responsible for this immune pressure as people who recover from Covid-19 disease only constitute a relatively small subset of the population and mount Abs against a much broader and more diversified panel of S-derived epitopes. Given the nature of the vaccinal Abs and the large vaccine coverage rates in most countries, there can be no doubt that the steadily increasing population-level immune pressure found to be exerted on RBD, for example, is caused by vaccination of large masses of people (in a previous contribution, I have expressed my astonishment about the fact that these brilliant scientists didn’t even mention ’mass vaccination’ at all as a potential cause of the massive increase in S-directed immune pressure; (see my recent contribution: 'Why the ongoing mass vaccination experiment drives a rapid evolutionary response of SARS-CoV-2'). This evolution is, of course, extremely worrisome. Whereas progressing convergent evolution towards increased resistance against functional, S-specific Abs elicited by the vaccine may not necessarily further increase the affinity of the virus for the Ace-2 receptor (and hence, not commonly cause more disease in young and healthy individuals), it is reasonable to assume that such evolution will rapidly raise the number and severity of disease cases in the vaccinated part of the population. This is because growing VI escape will cause vaccinees to lose their vaccine-mediated immune protection while having their natural, CoV-nonspecific natural Abs suppressed by high titers of long-lived, S-specific vaccinal Abs (4). It is reasonable to assume that, as a general rule, the level of suppression of natural, CoV-nonspecific Abs will increase with increasing strength (adjuvantation!), frequency and coverage rate of booster immunizations (including 2nd generation vaccines!).</p>

        <p>Hey, this is a blog, the only references are links to other blogs the author has written or long lists of papers, with no indication which support the claims being made. This is not how scientific papers are written, each claim should be backed up by specific references, or experimental evidence. It's also extremely jargon heavy which, to me at least, makes it seem like he is trying to seem smart rather than be understood. I have written many papers and several blogs on my reserch, this is not how to do either effectively. But his premise is also clearly wrong; we know that people can catch different covid varients twice so the natural antibody immunity is not varient non specific, we also know that the mRNA vaccines are &rt;80% effective against ANY symptomatic infection from the delta varient, so there is some non specificity in the vaccines. They also do not stop your immue system for working, producing new antibodies to different varients. </p>
<p>This also still dosn't touch the point being made, he is again talking about selection pressures, not the chance of new varients emerging, which can only happen through random mutation. Random mutation is random, the only way to improve the chance of getting a particular outcome is to repeat the process (in this case by letting more people get infected). This is why this experiment: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plVk4NVIUh8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plVk4NVIUh8</a> is done over a long time in an extremely large petri dish; more bacteria, means a higher chance of mutations.</p>

        <p>Hi, I just wanted to say if you have any other questions, let me know, you seem to be arguing in good faith and reading source material to form your view which is good, though from my point of view the sources are unreliable. This is not just some silly internet argument, if you get vaccinated, it could save you or people around you from long term health problems or worse. The vaccines we have are amoung the most effective ever made, if you want to read more I'd suggest these papers, these are all peer reviewed and published in the top journals:</p>

        <p>The cdc is saying that vaccinated people are only really vunerabe to the delta varient (which arose in unvaccinated people BTW), but unvaccinated people are also vunerable it the delta varient (in fact more vunerable) as well as being vunerable to all other varients. So delta cases make a much higher proportion of cases in vaccinated people, just like how if we cured cot death in male children a lager proportion of infant deaths in males would be due to neglect. But you getting vaccinated will not lead to more spread of delta, just like if you saved your child from cot death it wouldn't make you more likely to neglect it, it is a relatively larger piece of a much smaller pie. This missunderstanding is why my conclusions are in line with the cdc (everyone should get vaccinated as soon as possible) while your are at odds with them.</p>

        <p>I think you have missunderstood the situation, for simplicity I will just talk about the pfizer vacine. This vacine is \~95% effective against the alpha varient (the original varient), but only \~88% effective against the delta varient (study here: <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2108891">https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2108891</a>). Because it is less effective and the delta varient is better at spreading, most people who are sick, who have been vaccinated, are sick with the delta varient. So if you compare percentages it looks like vaccinated people are more likely to be infected by the delta varient, but in reality they are less likely to be infected by any varient, it is a bigger slice of a much smaller pie.</p>

        <p>And how antibodies are important but T cells are the MOST IMPORTANT! And how to take care of yourself at a cellular level. The red flag for me was early on. Anytime someone tells me there is only one option, I am automatically sketchy. If sars isn’t a new virus , that means we already have treatments.

        <p>Some people can’t mentally fathom the thought of it being anything sinister. Their mind would literally break. Cognitive dissonance. The CDC has printed lies and aren’t even covert about it anymore. It’s just a whoops, try consulting your primary doctor now that your feeling adverse effects. No way it could be the vaccine. It’s gross what they’ve done. Our complicit government diagnosed millions of people and quarantined people for a YEAR using PCR tests that they denounce last week as DEFECTIVE AT DIAGNOSING COVID. Convenient.</p>

        <p>Ja.  Hopefully they both pop. GME seems to have more potential and Ryan Cohen is boss enough you can't even find out his birthday.</p>
<p>I got a few AMC of course.  It will blow up when GME does, I figure. GME, by my understanding has more short interest and people are saying infinite money glitch with it. But I am a dumb ape.</p>
<p>Either way, the whole house of cards is gonna fall.  Either by making us wealthy or screwing us.</p>

        <p>You just described a couple of my classmates from Appalachia in a nutshell.</p>
<p>It's weird too, I guess one of the reasons I am not really easily intimidated or bullied is because it just never happened much.</p>
<p>I was always physically taller/stronger than my peers in the same age groups. As you can imagine, no one really messed with me because of it. One of the biggest bad ass's, thieving, scumming legends I have ever personally met (Where I grew up at, everyone knows this guy, he is literally a legend and not a good one lol, good guy just bad choices). He was known for being wild/crazy even as a boy, we are talking like 7 or 8 years old and known as the terror of the valley. It was around this time on the bus, we had to sit together. He straight up told me the very first time we met, (I will never mess with you, your huge and you could whip my ass in a heartbeat.) This guy never did, even 20 years later, before I left the area to marry my canadian highschool sweetheart that i met online lol, while he was robbing and messing with everyone in the valley, he always had nothing but respect for me whenever we would run into each other. He really was not a bad person, he just made bad choices.</p>
<p>On the other hand.</p>
<p>I always had people on the bus, people who were like high schoolers and I was in middle school who would bully and make fun of me (mainly for being poor and "dirty" because I played outside alot as a kid). They did this because of my size and thinking they get social points for it. It was always a show for others.</p>
<p>This has continued somewhat as an adult and is why I avoid bars or social settings that involve alcohol.</p>
<p>Because some hot headed prick that is mad at the world wants to gain some ego points by picking on a giant and looking like a bad ass. It doesnt happen often, but when it does I do my best to avoid it. I have alot of rage pent up in my heart, if I let lose on someone, I would likely hurt them pretty bad and honestly one of my worst fears is getting Alzheimer's and road housing a poor nursing staff member. Not saying there arent people out there who couldnt knock me out in a punch, but they are far and few in between.</p>
<p>Most of the hate and ignorance we are seeing is because people are mad at everything, and they got to take it out on something.</p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing. </p>
<p>It’s interesting what you say because I think all of us who actually think for ourselves are damaged in some way and have been left to independently think or fend for ourselves. </p>
<p>For my part I wasn’t bullied because I carefully befriended the right people at school but I had a very limited upbringing and was deserted at 16 so I had to fend for myself. It took 10 years of making mistakes for me to learn the life skills which I will now pass onto my children (as parenting should be done) but I too had to overcome many fears and some of them didn’t make a lot of sense to me. I listen a LOT to my subconscious because it has taken care of me for the majority of my life and filled the void left by a lack of parents, friends and social skills early on. </p>
<p>The most important lesson anyone can learn is to stop hiding from your problems and address them, overcome fears, fight back at things which you do not agree with and stand your ground. </p>
<p>Everyone who voluntarily is a part of this sub is doing exactly that because you are walking head first into a battle we cannot win, a 90/10 majority, but the fact you are willing to do that is one of the biggest decisions you will ever make in your life and it will make you infinitely stronger as a person.</p>

        <p>That's the true irony of the toxic victimized mindset - and it's been able to be refined throughout history nonetheless... Dare-I-say, it's what is the intended mindset for a typical citizen of the 'New Normal' itself. 😒  </p>
<p><em>"I KNOW I'm acting crazy and destructive! It's because of</em> <strong><em>[INSERT SCAPEGOAT HERE]</em></strong> <em>- they're the REASON I have to be like this! Until they change or stop existing, I'm COMPLETELY justified!!"</em>  </p>
<p>...God help us... And not ONLY in our dealings those who suffer this mindset from the jabba jabba side, but also so that we ourselves are not consumed by our confrontation with it... 😶</p>

        <p>The argument now concerning the CDC switching back regulations since vaccines are not effective enough is to blame the unvaccinated. Hilarious. A headline I read on PBS from a medical professional was "the unvaccinated are putting the vaccinated at risk."</p>
<p>Sorry I thought the explicit point of the vaccine was to move you out of "at risk." If it doesn't do that, there's a problem.</p>

        <p>Seems like ADE would also apply to people who got covid, too. They should be mostly or partially immune to the same virus now, in a similar way to how a vaccine work. So people who get covid are also the ones creating variants.</p>

        <p>If I’m not mistaken it’s only really been seen in vaccination programs. Originally in the 50s when they tried to make RSV vaccines (rhinovirus) and then I think similar issues with SARS/coronavirus vaccines. There’s a reason they’ve never successfully developed them before - I’ve wondered if this is why they’ve pursued this new
mRNA and gene editing routes ? . But yeah it seems to be an issue with just vaccines - I’ve been searching for the video clip but I remember even fauci warning about this in the early days</p>

        <p>Question for you guys.</p>
<p>A few months ago when the roll out began, the messaging was 'it's ~95% effective against contracting the virus'. Now the message is 'You can still get covid but you won't get as sick'. </p>
<p>Tell me, am I crazy? Was that not the sales pitch originally? I seem to be hearing it now as "whoops! Yeah so you can still get it but don't worry you won't get as sick" when before it was sold as a saviour to give us normalcy back.</p>

        <p>I believe in covid. Im not an "anti vaxxer". I wear a mask. I social distance. I try to be as hygenic as possible. Yet I'm still at fault even after following all the guidelines and safety precautions because I dont want the vaccine.  With these vaccine mandates it's a sad precedence that's being set for an even bleaker future.</p>

        <p>In the UK I honestly don't know anyone who cares either way whether I have the jab or not. My mates think I'm at risk of death if I don't have it, because they aren't as bright as I thought they were :(. I've explained we don't know the long term effects, Robert Malone thinks they are a bad idea, average age of death is 80, shirt teem side effects cab be devastating for some, etc. Makes no difference. </p>
<p>But nobody I know thinks they should be mandatory or that I should not be allowed somewhere if I'm not vaxxed. </p>
<p>Reddit is absolutely full of wannabe Nazis though. It feels like a good 80% of the average redditors are fascist fucks. I really dislike the average redditor. Ignorant and evil.</p>

        <p>They can call me selfish all they want at this point, I could care less what these idiots think. Homozygous MTHFR mutations here, high risk of vaccine injury. I know the excruciating pain that comes with chronic illness and many autoimmune diseases. I will never go through that again. I'm willing to fight to the death to avoid getting vaccinated and there is no changing my mind. There are millions just like me. Don't worry. They can try all they want but this will NOT become the new normal. There will be war first. A huge percentage of the world simply will not tolerate this. Billions of people will have to be slaughtered outright in order to push this agenda. That will be a massive roadblock.</p>

        <p>The mods also ban you from random reddits if you participate in here. I never even posted in  r/aww and oddlysatisfying tifu. Then got emails back to back telling me I'm banned. Like why you watching where people post and what??? I'm honestly starting to resent reddit, I cant believe its run by biased snowflake mods who have literally NOTHING better to do with their pathetic lives.</p>

        <p>It's funny...I saw someone post to get the vaccine to "protect those that can't protect themselves". Um...that's not how the mRNA gene therapy works. You can still get it and still pass it on. <em>sigh</em> Will they ever stop with the virtue signalling?</p>

        <p>Hahaha funny when they think people here who've injected drugs recreationally or pierced/tattooed themselves are suddenly afraid of needles. Maybe....just maybe....we're more afraid of who or what is at the other end of the needle. And I freely admit I'm a selfish coward, so go ahead and waste some of your life needlessly repeating it back to me. Pretty sure it actually offends me more when people try insisting I care about them somewhere deep down in the abyss of my heart.</p>

        <p>Exactly. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't particularly recommend heroin to anyone, but I'd damn sure rather a loved one choose something with over a century of known risks/benefits instead of something so new that they're pushing so damn hard. I don't care what their excuse is.</p>

<p>Look I’m vaccinated and I wear a mask in public (usually) but I think the mandates are dumb. The lockdowns are completely fucking evil and I will never obey those again unless literal Ebola is running rampant or something. </p>
<p>We are not selfish. THEY are authoritarian assholes, Karens, and socio-fascists trying to tell everyone else how to run their lives. Fuck them. Defy anyone who micromanages your life.</p>

        <p>McDonald's is my pillar argument; how was one of the most notoriously large vectors for spreading disease - FAST FOOD PREP - open in full capacity, with people make shit money that probably had little to no health care or standards, probably don't shower daily, etc...?</p>
<p>This doesn't even include the low hanging fruit of nurses working through all waves and not dying in massive heaps of piles of bodies.</p>
<p>FOLLOW THE MONEY! Wal-Mart, McDonald's, all major retailers and chains were allowed to operate through the worse of this.</p>

<p>The CDC deserves to be disbanded and reconstructed with civilian oversight or something. Because it’s a crime the way they pushed this vaccine for the variants as 99 percent effective and just switched their opinions after jabbing millions. I’d have such bad jab remorse based on this article. It’s so sad 😞</p>

        <p>The alternative is just getting attacked by them with no defence. Constantly giving ground. There won't be much left.</p>
<p>This will almost certainly end with mass bloodshed, and if you're unwilling to defend yourself, it will be a very disappointing end.</p>

        <p>I love your post, explaining this very well; and I get your anger as well, these people we're up against, who shame and blame us for not getting this experimental, harmful and frankly useless poison, these people themselves haven't paid attention and invested even one fucking hour into researching this clotshot. All the important information is out there, yet, they didn't wanna know, so screw them. </p>
<p>This upcoming winter will get rough; they will experience their bodies disintegrating due to the jab, ADE, side effects etc and they will blame us, instead of using their brains just once. Well yeah, not my problem you know; they can blame us all they want, I will never ever get it and I will gladly and cheerfully observe what's going on this upcoming Winter.</p>

        <p>It is caused by sub-par antibodies which are effective against one variation of a virus but prevents an effective natural immune response against other variations. It happens a lot with viruses for which there are many serotypes - variations of a virus characterized by the different molecules on its cell surface which trigger an immune response, aka "antigens". Viruses such as ...coronaviruses. </p>
<p>ADE can happen without vaccination - it can happen if you are infected with one type of Dengue fever, lose cross-protective immunity over time, and then are infected with a different serotype (you would have lifelong immunity against the Dengue serotype you initially survived) </p>
<p>Because you have lifelong immunity against the serotype of Dengue you survived, you will forever have antibodies against that serotype in your body. But when you are infected with another serotype of the virus, your immune response is improper, because the antibodies you already have against the other serotype will bind to the new serotype - thwarting the production of new antibodies - but will ultimately not be able to neutralize it because of the different antigens on its surface. So then when the phagocytosis (enveloping by a cell) of the antibody with the unneutralized virus attached to it is carried out by immune cells, the process of phagocytosis which would ideally lead to destruction of a virus which has been neutralized by the antibody, does NOT lead to destruction, and instead causes the immune cells to die and/or start producing more of the virus, and then one can develop viremia, which means the virus is now travelling through your bloodstream and can damage your lungs especially for some reason. For what reason, I do not know. I'm not a doctor, I'm studying genetic engineering and this is the explanation a professor of mine gave us. We did not get into the medical aspect too much, just how this mechanism of viruses works. </p>
<p>So afaik the worry about VADE (ADE caused by vaccination) from the coronavirus vaccine is that people who have been vaccinated against covid are now (forever?) producing antibodies against that serotype the vaccine is based on. I assume with normal immune responses to coronaviruses, your immunity is not lifelong. You can get the same cold (serotype of cold) every year over and over. I do not think the vaccine gives you lifelong immunity against covid-19, but if it did, yeah, ADE might be a concern. Because whatever antibodies the vaccinated are making now will not be effective against other serotypes of covid (and coronaviruses mutate A LOT lol so it's bound to happen) and so whenever they are infected by another serotype, this will happen to them because the ineffective antibodies will bind to the new virus before the body has the chance to muster a new antibody response. It even says this was a concern on the wikipedia page but it has ofc been labelled as misinformation, KEK. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody-dependent_enhancement">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody-dependent_enhancement</a></p>
<p>I don't think ADE will be a concern because people who were vaccinated in January already stopped producing antibodies, according to a study I read but unfortunately didn't save. I think there are other goals of this "vaccine" but don't want to get into it now.</p>

        <p>What would it take for you to change your mind??  You clearly have an unpopular opinion. Maybe you are right and maybe you are wrong. Maybe all the fine folks in this thread are correct. Maybe they aren’t. The question is are you willing to change your mind?  If so, think about what that would take. Is it reasonable?  If nothing would change your mind, than it’s dogma.  Pure and simple. </p>
<p>I have colleagues that have died. I have a close friend that has long haul symptoms. Maybe I’m the outlier, and maybe your experience is normal. I’m of the opinion that the vaccine saves lives. But I’m willing to be convinced. Are you?</p>

        <p>“What would change your mind.”</p>
<p>One of the biggest components is that there is a significant trust gap—the majority of the users here justifiably believe that the public officials driving policy have been lying to us since basically the beginning. <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/07/noble-lies-covid-fauci-cdc-masks.html?fbclid=IwAR0iDB0fVJ4PwoEPlTxzgcG8t1aYH5rBoN2kCn8Q9RL5hPahZKPTfq0FjEk">This piece from Slate</a> does a good job of explaining that, and explaining why that causes the reaction that we’re seeing (even though most or all of the lies were told with the best of intentions).</p>
<p>Beyond that though, here’s a list of some of the reasons why people are hesitant to seek out the jab:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They don’t believe they’re at significant risk of contracting the virus itself;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They’re concerned about the safety of the jab and its potential side effects—that goes doubly for the people who likely aren’t at significant risk of contracting the virus itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prices send signals—if you have to pay/bribe me in order to get me to take something that you have, you’re sending the signal that what you’re pushing is something with negative net value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People are unwilling to take official jab narratives on faith (see the above article about trust &amp; lies), and want to see substantive long term data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In certain minority communities, there’s also the additional baggage of past racist policies (particularly in the AA and NA communities).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People saw how democrats flipped on the jab last November—Dems like VP KH went from steadfastly refusing the jab to wholeheartedly supporting the jab the second that Biden was declared the winner in November.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, Dems have repeatedly cried wolf, and we are the weary townspeople.</p>

        <p>Just listen to my logic, I know they are forcing us to take the vaccine but unlike polio vaccine, covid vaccine is not a fully effective one but it does help reduce the severity of  covid. Maybe in future we may get a better vaccine when things aren't rushed.
Point is people think getting vaccinated means no more spreading of virus. NO it's not!! Vaccination is solely for the individual to have a better chance at survival and everyone is susceptible to spread the virus either vaccinated or not.
Now I'm not from US but I have seen SO many parents succumb to the virus. My own aunt had a close call and we were just praying for luck. Yes unless you see how a life can go from normal to gasping for breathe you won't understand the seriousness of problem. Mark my words, dying from covid is horrible than getting hanged. A normal human breathes 10-15 times in a minute, my aunt was breathing 30 per minute to get the oxygen at the same fighting the urge to cough every time she breathes. Imagine this, if you can't consciously keep breathe you will die and doing this until she was kept on ventilator, my god she looked half lifeless to me, such a toll it takes.
People, you may not trust the govt or pharma, but the vaccine doesn't kill, the virus does. So if you weigh the risks, I say taking the vaccine is a better choice.</p>

        <p>I’ve found that the people who use the term selfish as a derogatory, lack self awareness. They are usually angry because the person they are insulting is not actively doing something that benefits them. The act of requiring other people to do your bidding is pretty selfish.</p>

        <p>My husband’s grandma had a stroke after getting her first dose. Her own doctor’s are gaslighting her, and she now has to live in an assisted living facility. The fact that medical professionals won’t even acknowledge or look into why the shot may have brought on a stroke is hugely concerning to me, and it undermines the push to convince skeptical people to trust medical expertise. </p>

        <p>Two anecdotal examples and no actual evidence to back it up. Shocking.</p>
<p>&rt;These stories are just a couple and we are not being told the truth about these so-called vaccinations. </p>
<p>So what is the truth? What aren't they telling us? What are they if you're calling them "so-called" vaccines?</p>
<p>My most burning question, that none of you ever seem to have an answer for, is why? What's the point in cooking up a global pandemic to trick everyone into getting shots that do ??? (Sorry, I'm not sure what you think the vaccines do if you're apparently not all 5G conspiracy/tracking chip lunatics). What's the point in you guys losing your jobs and getting ostracised?</p>
<p>Come on. You guys have the insider info. You've outsmarted all of us silly sheep. Let us in on the secret. What's the endgame?</p>

<p>Also, you didn't answer my questions. I'm guessing because your dog brain can't puzzle through them.</p>
<p>But, come on, give it another shot! What is the point of every government, every media agency, and all medical professionals on the entire planet getting together and inventing a pandemic? What does the "so-called" vaccine <em>actually</em> do?</p>

        <p>You could have just said you're an idiot without any understanding of science, or why we're vaccinating people in the first place. You didn't have to put out this angry childish highly misinformed long post. You talk about not trusting your government as an argument, as if this is exclusive to the US. The pandemic is far more than American politics, but I guess you're to ignorant to understand. This is a global pandemic. The fact that you connect this to some U.S government conspiracy shows your inability to actually think for yourself. You got that idea from somewhere.</p>
<p>You're free to make your choice, but then you can also live with the restrictions that follows. Just like it should be. Your choice is wrong. Education is free.</p>

        <p>Certain levels of enforcement are desirable to prevent extreme adverse effects to society - stopping/deterring murderers, rapists, etc.</p>
<p>Covid does not fulfill these conditions because</p>
<p>A) it's not dangerous aside from a tiny segment of the population, and even then delta and the emerging variants are much weaker than the original (as is typical)</p>
<p>B) vaccinated people still happily get infected and can pass on the virus, so it doesn't even prevent it. It's difficult to tell how much it truly has an impact since A) it's summer and B) the criteria for testing vaccinated people has changed, meaning unvaccinated will be drastically overrepresented in cases; and,</p>
<p>C) This level of medical intervention and fascism is unprecedented, and certainly not justified by the risk level of covid. It's nowhere near dangerous enough to even remotely justify measures of this kind - the division is ideological rather than practical.</p>

        <p>Firstly, with covid's extremely low death rate, how many people does one person effectively "endanger", taking transmission rate and immunity into account (prior immunity exists, and even an asymptomatic infection breaks the chain)?</p>
<p>Secondly, it is the right of an individual to choose what happens to their body. We can make all kinds of absurd arguments once we start having to consider widespread communal impact (ban fat people from society, ban driving above a low speed limit, ban fast food, ban alcohol, ban smoking, etc).</p>

        <p>You don’t have to get the vaccine. If being unvacced is dangerous to other people then private businesses don’t have to cater to you either. Nobody is MaKiNg you get the vaccine. The White House doesn’t even have a vaccine mandate to work there… it’s also not anyone else’s fault when you get shunned into being a hermit.</p>

<p>Let me turn this back around on you. Do you think that businesses should be able to fire you if you have a chronic health condition? A disability? There are people out there who can't get vaccinated because of allergies or issues with their immune systems. But fuck them I guess, right?</p>

        <p>If the health concerns are not specifically listed on the known side effects, yes. If they are known, no. It's your choice to get it or not. Either way, you should be consulting with an accredited medical professional and not basing your choice on what family, friends, or strangers on the internet tell you.</p>

<li>Before a vaccine is registered for use, it is tested extensively during development and then in thousands of people. Testing first begins with laboratory research, then animal studies and finally human clinical trials. Clinical trials involve testing the vaccine in volunteers, and are conducted in phases.
Clinical trials must provide scientific evidence which demonstrates that the benefits of a vaccine greatly outweigh any risks.
Phase 1
Phase 1 clinical trials usually include a few dozen healthy adult volunteers. They focus primarily on establishing that the vaccine is safe, and also on demonstrating that the vaccine induces an immune response.</li>
</ol>
<p>Phase 2
Phase 2 clinical trials have hundreds of volunteers, and can include specific groups for whom the new vaccine is intended. For example older adults, children or people with pre-existing medical conditions. These trials aim to test whether the vaccine causes an immune response and confirm that it is safe with minor side effects, such as a mild headache.</p>
<p>Phase 3
Phase 3 clinical trials include many thousands of participants. They aim to test whether a vaccine is effective in preventing people from getting the disease – in this case COVID-19. Phase 3 trials also thoroughly assess the vaccine for safety and side effects.
In a Phase 3 trial, researchers usually compare data between vaccinated people and those who received a placebo (like a salt water injection). They compare the frequency of infection, disease severity and any reported side effects between the two groups.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Your use of the word risk sounds like death is the only qualifier for covid to be considered a risk. In reality it is already well established COVID-19 symptoms can sometimes persist for months. The virus can damage the lungs, heart and brain, which increases the risk of long-term health problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Past wrong doings by a company would not be used as an argument in any other situation. China produces plenty of medical products and commits atrocities, does that really mean we should be avoiding all of this products. Companies that supported the Nazi’s are still in operation, refusing to use their products because of that fact is senseless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personal anecdotes are worthless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Goal posts didn’t change, the virus mutated to the delta strain. Lol face palm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vaccines contain a small amount of the virus, our bodies produce antibodies to fight off the disease which can result in symptoms of the virus being present. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once our bodies have developed these antibodies they are more efficient at fighting off the infection.</p>
<p>Trying not to facepalm myself to death but why would you be afraid of taking a small dose of covid from the vaccine which result in symptoms but not the actual full blown virus? Lol</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In case you aren’t aware, covid has had a dramatic effect on the economy and the population therefore an equally dramatically response is required by the government to alleviate these issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We’ve actually been vaccinating people since 1796, there are endless long term studies of vaccines available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I unfortunately I do not have the time or learning disability to read all the conspiracy theories out there, though wearing masks and having verification of getting the vaccine doesn’t sound conspiratorial as it does practical.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When your choices infringe on the safety and health of others, don’t be surprised pikachu when hit with the repercussions.</p>

<p>The word "quarantine" originates from quarantena, the Venetian language form, meaning "forty days". This is due to the 40-day isolation of ships and people practised as a measure of disease prevention related to the plague. That was back in the 17th century you Neanderthal.</p>

        <p>Well according to your post, phase 3 was done to ensure the vaccines effectiveness at 98%. They touted it at this percentage for months. Then they downplayed “breakthrough” cases which led more people to get vaccinated thinking they would be protected against COVID and variants. Only to come out and say this ... https://www.nbcboston.com/news/coronavirus/cdc-warns-in-internal-document-that-war-has-changed-with-coronavirus/6326326/. So at the very least, they lied.

        <p>In this case the scale of the intervention is larger, which means that presumably almost everyone will be taking the vaccine, leaving few around from which we could determine what went wrong. These vaccines are a relatively fresh and new product, and we don't know the long term risk.  So while clinical trials may end, from a common sense and public perspective the experiment is ongoing.</p>
<p>Many also have natural immunity from the virus. If someone is afraid they could isolate or look at repurposed treatments, but no one can untake this vaccine.</p>

        <p>Sweet holy fucksticks, this thread is a gathering for complete and utter fucknuts.. from the other side, you truly are stupid, selfish pricks. You have no fucking idea what the fuck you are talking about. Go back to school.</p>
<p>Point 1. It is NOT experimental. They did all the experimental bits before they were approved for use. You Fucking idiot.</p>
<p>Point 2. Yes it is rushed because the plague threatened to level civilisation if we didn’t speed up its development, testing, and then usage. It is in no way as ‘buggy’ as cyberpunk and is the worst analogy I’ve heard this year you fucking idiot.</p>
<p>Point 3. Unless YOU, YOURSELF is locked in a room with 2 years worth of food, drink and air, you ARE at risk of getting it. Might be 30%, might be 5% but you ARE at risk, you fucking idiot.</p>
<p>Point 4. Yes, the collapse of civilisation is an emergency, you fucking idiot.</p>
<p>Point 5. Has fuck all to do with the efficacy of the vaccine, and has everything to do with the legal system, you fucking idiot.</p>
<p>Point 6. Isn’t even worth addressing, you fucking idiot. I don’t know what shit Fox News/conservative website you are visiting with such bullshit figures but you need to stop going there and go to a library instead. You fucking idiot.</p>
<p>Point 7. Trying to balance healthcare and economy? Sure that’s proof the vaccine is unsafe. Btw this was sarcasm, you fucking idiot.</p>
<p>Point 8. Ah you know what, my fingers are tiring and I’m getting more and more like I wanna dox you and come beat your fucking idiotic brains in. It wouldn’t take long. You fucking idiot.</p>
<p>One thing I must reiterate though above all else, is that you sir</p>
<p>Are a fucking idiot.</p>

<p>I wonder if the people crippled or dead from vaccine side effects feel the same way, especially when the vaccine is so unnecessary for most of the population...</p>
<p>What is the child fatality rate from covid? Astronomically low. You can't use that as a guilting point. Flu and car accidents are both more dangerous.</p>

        <p>"What can we do to change what the government is doing" is probably the laziest, most nihilistic argument I have ever seen against fighting blatant authoritarianism. Do you think regimes like China and the Third Reich would have occurred if people fought their masters? How many revolutions have happened throughout history? Hell, even on a non violent note, look at all of the change that has come about in the world, let alone just the US, from peaceful protests. </p>
<p>You're right, sitting on Reddit and bitching accomplishes nothing. Activism, protesting, resistance - that is what sparks change.</p>

<p>Why did people fear polio, it didn't even kill that many people, most people survived.</p>
<p>Polio wasn't anywhere near as deadly as covid
https://www.chop.edu/news/feature-article-flashback-parenting-and-summer-1950s</p>
<p>During the height of the polio threat in America (1900-1950s), these concerns were all too real. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), between 1950 and 1953 there were approximately 119,000 cases of paralytic polio in the United States and 6,600 deaths</p>
<p>And just like that BOOOOOOM you are fucking roasted. </p>

        <p>People feared polio because it could put you in a fucking iron lung? Paralyze you regardless how old or healthy you were? What are you on about? You're trying to convince us that the damage polio caused is equal to the damage covid can cause. It's simply not the same. Bad comparison, acting like a child in your comments, clearly furious for some reason and wanting to feel like you have a point that you don't.</p>

        <p>You are absolutely 100%  incorrect, in fact nobody could've missed the boat more than you.</p>
<p>So let me help you out.</p>
<p>Polio isn't/wasn't even half as dangerous as covid. In the worst polio year ever only 50,000 cases were reported and around 3000 people died. In the USA. </p>
<p>In the first year of covid pandemic, there have been millions of cases and hundreds of thousands dead.</p>
<p>But you're right it's polio that I want you to be afraid of.</p>

<p>&rt; COVID-19 deaths are identified using a new ICD–10 code. When COVID-19 is reported as a cause of death – or when it is listed as a “probable” or “presumed” cause — the death is coded as U07.1. This can include cases with or without laboratory confirmation.</p>

<p>What a reach lol. Yes, I do, that has nothing to do with the topic at hand.</p>
<p>&rt; How is the virus non existent? Are you suggesting the virus doesn't exist at ALL?</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/gsDlHprql-g">That's exactly what I'm suggesting</a>. Put it on 1.5x and listen while doing something else. There's a document in the description with links to all his sources if you're interested.</p>
<p>Even if the virus <em>does</em> exist, here's an excerpt from said document, and a link to its source.</p>
<p>&rt; Working in collaboration with Sanofi, Scripps 
Institute, Harvard, MIT and NIH, Dr. Fauci’s decision to unilaterally promote vaccines as a primary intervention for 
several designated “infectious diseases” precluded <em><em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1232869/">proven therapies</a></em></em> from being applied to the sick and dying.</p>
<p>HCQ and Ivermectin have been proven time and time again to be incredibly effective against CoViD, Yet they're never mentioned and rarely used.</p>

        <p>Alright, trying to change the subject again. Very nice.</p>
<p>God's existence can't be proven true <em>or</em> false. That's why it's faith-based. Amazing that you don't understand that. Again though, irrelevant, try to stay focused.</p>
<p>&rt; I'll wait until you can do that before I waste anymore time on you.</p>
<p>Nice logical fallacy. "If your position on <em>A</em> is wrong, your position on <em>B</em> is <em>certainly</em> wrong too, so I won't waste time on it."</p>
<p>&rt; Is HQC hydroxy chloroquine?? If so show me the articles that show it's safe.</p>
<p>Clearly you haven't clicked on either link then, huh? The second link is specifically about HCQ. One of many studies.</p>

        <p>It is new and experimental for treating covid.... They are using what they think will help/work based off experience w respiratory illness. However in the clinical sense anything used to treat a new virus will be experimental. </p>
<p>I'm guessing you're saying that Sticking a tube down someones throat and pumping air into them until their body hopefully recovers isnt experimental. </p>
<p>And while pumping air into someones body isn't experimental, doing it to treat a new disease would bring it into the experimental phase of treating that new disease.</p>

        <p>so you are telling me that you don’t know what treatment is, ok cool </p>
<p>there are treatment protocols depending on the state of patient, symptoms, suspected disease or a damaged systems </p>
<p>they exist for ER, for ICU, for planned hospitalizations, for changes between patient’s states etc. they can differ per country, they will be subject to drug authorizations and cost</p>
<p>if you go in ER with respiratory distress they will always proceed in the same way, they don’t care what type of alien disease you have </p>
<p>there will be nothing experimental ever. it’s not a field where you can come with treatment options out of your ass</p>
