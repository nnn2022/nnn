    <strong>Help stop Covid-19 vaccine mandates at the University System of Maryland</strong>
    <p><p>As many of us have discussed in this subreddit, experimental vaccine mandates impose a new dystopian normal. I am a student at one of the USM schools (USM includes every public university in Maryland) that impose a strict vaccine mandate for attending fall semester classes. The only way out of getting the forced vaccine is through medical and religious exemptions. Luckily, I was able to get a religious exemption, but many students and faculty don't even know that it's possible for them to get an exemption, thinking that it's reserved for the extremely pious. I recently joined a grassroots volunteer organization that is dedicated to fighting this battle legally: The Coalition for Future Maryland. This includes not just trying to end the mandate, but also fighting medical apartheid battles when they come. We don't know what systems will be put in place to sequester the unvaccinated students. In fact, people are already trying to report unvaccinated students not wearing masks to the whistleblower hotline.</p>
<p>The group is looking for volunteers, not just students, faculty, and concerned parents, but even people from other states. It's also looking for donations to fund legal fees. We need $100,000 to fight this in court, and we already have about $17,000.</p>
<p>A lot of us are giving up the fight when we get some semblance of freedom back. But that freedom can be easily taken away. We know that vaccine mandates will probably come to K-12 schools, so it is important to establish a legal precedent now.</p>
<p>Here's a link to their website: <a href="https://www.coalitionforfuturemd.org/">https://www.coalitionforfuturemd.org/</a></p>
<p>You can contact them on a form link or via email if you're interested in volunteering. From all of the patriots in Maryland: Thank you!</p></p>

        <p>&rt;It's not like you have to attend university at all</p>
<p>It's not like you have to take an airplane ever again / at all.</p>
<p>It's not like you have to go to a concert ever again.</p>
<p>It's not like you have to go to a bar ever again.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Doesn't mean they aren't human rights in the end tho. Access to education is considered essential human right no matter if you're black, gay, a none-binary person or unvaccinated.</p>
