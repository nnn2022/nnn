    <strong>I cannot quantify all that I've lost since this scamdemic began. I need friends who think like me and fast</strong>
    <p><p>I'm a 31 year old male and my story is tragic. My life was perfect in March of 2020. I had my health, a great job, was saving money, and was traveling 3-4 times a year. Then the scamdemic happened, and here's my life since.</p>
<p>March 2020 - My paternal grandfather passed away of a heart attack 3 weeks after lockdown began. He was 93 and active. The worry and new sedentary lifestyle killed him. Thanks Cuomo, you rapey bastard.</p>
<p>September 2020 - I came down with a new chronic pain out of nowhere.</p>
<p>October 2020 - I took an antibiotic called Cipro for this chronic pain that I thought might've been an infection but it wasn't. This is a very dangerous drug that has completely wrecked my entire body. I am still disabled from it 6 months later with tendon, nerve, and vision damage</p>
<p>January 2021 - My maternal grandfather dies of the vaccine. He beat Covid in August 2020 but he died mysteriously in his sleep 2 weeks after the first Moderna shot. <strong>This is a vaccine death.</strong> I don't give a shit what "experts" or sheep say. It's not safe. Most pharmaceuticals aren't. I don't give a fuck about your peer reviewed, double bind studies. I see OUTCOMES playing out in MY LIFE. He was in a nursing home and I had not seen him for 9 months.</p>
<p>May 2020 - I will be amputating the organ causing me chronic pain since September. And I will likely lose my job because I can't work at my current pain levels (mostly due to the body wide reaction to the antibiotic).  I have also been rejected for disability through my employer after paying into it for 4 years. They are intentionally adding to my suffering by denying me half my salary for a measley 2 years while I try to recover.</p>
<p>I have lost my faith in medicine after my grandfather was murdered by the vaccine, and after I became disabled by an antibiotic. I suffer from PTSD. My relationship with my brother, who is a pharmacist, is severely strained. I have a small family as it is - everyone is dead except my mom and brother (and some uncles and cousins who never call). If it wasn't for my poor mom, who has tried so hard to be there for me, and who worked really hard to have me, I'd swallow this bottle of Oxycodone right now (oh yeah, did I mention I'm addicted to narcotics now due to the antibiotic destroying my tendons?)</p>
<p>I have no joy anymore. Therapy didn't help me. I reject God and faith at this point too, because I didn't think it was possible to punish someone with so much, in such record time. This is like sadism to pile on to someone who was on top of the world a year ago to disabled and suicidal practically overnight.</p>
<p>Please DM me. I need friends to talk to. There is a subreddit for those disabled by the antibiotic class, but I am banished. They are pro vaccine extremists with stockholm syndrome for the same people who poisoned them, now lining up in droves to take the vaccine (and flaring their symptoms).</p></p>

        <p>A book recommendation you should start reading immediatelyâ€”-healing and recovery by David r Hawkins.</p>
<p>Also, have you tried reintroducing good bacteria to heal from the antibiotic damage? Raw milk and fermented vegetables are both great options for this. Also, and this one is BIG, RAW PASTURE-RAISED EGGS. I eat one dozen daily. You can heal SO MUCH from this.</p>
