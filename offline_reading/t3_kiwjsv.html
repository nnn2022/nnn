    <strong>I have pieced together a timeline of getting out of this mess. You will not like it.</strong>
    <p><p>I refuse to watch the news on CNN or Fox or whatever and instead I make sure to look at original sources. Here is some data that I have seen.</p>
<p>The vaccine rollout (and 2021 in general) will suck. It will not go smooth. Our local public health department estimated it will take 9-12 months before we have "fully vaccinated" the population if all goes well (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSkkpJCHKuA at about 20 mins).</p>
<p>Additionally, the state Department of Health outlined a "potential secondary impact" that could take place around January-February (https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/BHG-COVID19StatewideSummaryForecastofBHImpacts-Nov2020Update.pdf). This impact could be something like a vaccine failing, deaths from the vaccine or just a really high level of death. All of those are very possible. </p>
<p>Additionally, the follow up period after phase 3 trials is 2 years. The vaccines being approved for EUA (emergency use authorization) will not be fully tested until around Nov-Dec of 2022. https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577</p>
<p>So here is the timeline.</p>
<p>2021 will SUCK and the vaccine rollout will be a mess. Summer of 2021 will be a CONSTANT barrage of propaganda to get people vaccinated. Social media will be sickening with I VACCINATED banners. People will likely get sick and die from the vaccine or shortly after getting it. It will be even more annoying than now.</p>
<p>I do think that ballgames and outdoor concerts will happen in summer of 2021, with masks and other restrictions. Summer will be alright but not at all back to normal.</p>
<p>Fall-winter of 2021-2022 will not be as bad as now, but still bad. Masks and indoor arenas at 25%-50%, "no more than 10 at Christmas," etc. There will likely be a small "hump/wave/surge/bump" whatever they call it after being down to almost nothing in the summer. </p>
<p>So that puts the end of the pandemic around June 2022. That is, indoor concerts at full capacity without masks. That lines up with what this historian who thinks 2022 and 2023 will still kind of suck as we deal with the socioeconomic fallout of the pandemic and the lockdowns. https://bgr.com/2020/12/22/coronavirus-update-what-happens-after-pandemic-ends/</p>
<p>So life probably won't be back to 2019 level of comfort for about 3 more years.</p>
<p>The vaccine will not become "mandatory" (except international travel) until MAYBE the end of 2022 but the pandemic should be over by then. If it does become mandatory then billions of people will have taken it and I personally wouldn't worry about it. </p>
<p>What do you think?</p></p>

        <p>&rt;So life probably won't be back to 2019 level of comfort for about 3 more years</p>
<p>After a 10 - 30% reduction in GDP (on top of the gradual suppression of wages that has taken place since 1960, the 2008 economic crash, <em>and</em> the banking debt explosion that was already due anyway) we won't be at 2019 levels of material luxury for another 30 years if we're lucky.</p>
<p>But we can get back to pre-1919 levels of personal freedom, comfort, and liberty any time enough of us decide.</p>

        <p>This seems accurate and makes sense. The sources are appreciated.</p>
<p>I especially am not looking forward to the social media propaganda for vaccination and ‘I got vaxed banners’ </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>In addition to the upcoming socioeconomic fallout in 2023, I’ve also been thinking about the fallout of the psyches of all of us, and the ways in which this is going to fragment us, not just within and individually, but towards each other. </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>In my own personal life, I’m tryn to figure out how to navigate this. To thrive during this. To still LIVE.  </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>And I don’t want to get vaccinated. I don’t trust the pharmaceuticals and I just am a very skeptical person. I don’t wanna get into the conspiracies and all that, I’m just nervous going forward in a few years, I don’t want to succumb to control, I’ve been like this my whole life but I’ve always been able to be this way sort of just by doing my own thing.</p>
<p>Now it’s like a scarlet letter - who are you - a vaxed person or not?</p>

        <p>Life will never go back to normal unless we fight for it with the blood and tears of patriots. Personally, i dont think Americans have the fight in them, they are pacified fat sheep that cant accept casualties, they will go along with it kicking and screaming all the way to the chinese style reeducation camps. </p>
<p>Globalists have been planning this for decades, the test run for the totalitarian state they want was China, now it's time to roll it out everywhere else. It's all about power.</p>

        <p>This seems realistic. At this rate, anyway. Who knows what will happen though. Wouldn’t be surprised if it all went to shit with some “new strain” or some other false crisis. Hope to goodness enough people just say no and it ends abruptly.</p>
