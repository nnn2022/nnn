    <strong>Vaccine passports - what can we do about it?</strong>
    <p><p>(I'm talking from a UK perspective here just to clarify!)</p>
<p>With our government 'investigating' the possibility of needing proof of vaccination to enter pubs and restaurants, I feel as though it's something we need to start preparing for.</p>
<p>First of all, what do you guys feel about this? Do you think it'll happen, and if so to what degree? Do you feel the pushback will be enough to stop it?</p>
<p>I'm torn, which is why I'm asking. At the moment, our opposition to this prospect is not something we are alone in. For starters, some big companies and experts have come out against it, as well as human rights group Liberty and the WHO also recommending against it (not that they're consistent, reliable backup but hey). Some of you may have seen the UK parliament petition which now has over 270,000 signatures and is scheduled for a debate on March 15. People who don't want the vaccine will obviously all be against it, though with the current campaign to make it look like uptake is as high as possible to sway people, we can't exactly be sure how many that is. Some people who do want the vaccine will also be against it as it will cause segregation and will invade their medical privacy. So, on the one hand, I feel as though we have enough support on this issue to win.</p>
<p>However, after this year I've realised that most people just go with anything, no matter how crazy, if it means they can get by. They just go with the crowd. After a year of this torture I feel like people will do anything if it means they can have their lives back. Even I, someone very much anti restrictions, have been feeling the desperation and often wondering if maybe it would be better just to give in if it happens - I can't do this anymore! So for people less firm in their stance I can imagine this feeling may sway them a lot more.</p>
<p>So this has led me to think that we do have a chance, but there needs to be something clear and organised - we need to show people what to do and show them that they're not alone in opposing this issue. People are much more likely to support us if they know what to do - if they feel alone and helpless they'll likely give into those feelings of desperation but if we organise now we could be prepared.</p>
<p>This leads to the question - <em>what can we do to oppose this?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For a start, there are petitions. However, petitions only reach so many people, and let's face it - they're just a bit of paper. We'll see how the debate on the issue goes next Monday, but a petition likely won't get us anywhere. It could be useful if we got enough people to sign it though - putting up posters and sharing it etc to raise awareness - in the way of it would show people just how many of their fellow citizens also oppose this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's also dealing with it in a legal way. I don't know much in this department, but I do know that this sub is full of people from many different backgrounds and some of you may know about the ways in which we could target this in a court - discrimination laws might be of use? I understand that laws are different in each country, so this may be complicated, but it'd be really good if someone could explain anything they may know about this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's also acts that are more like protests. Boycotts? Full blown marches? These things would have a more profound affect, but for them to work properly we need numbers numbers numbers. Before we started anything like that we'd need to get lots of people involved and make our cause as mainstream as possible. In the UK, protests are illegal (at least I believe so), and many people don't want to put themselves out there like that. If the protests and boycotts don't have enough people, they'll be putting themselves in potential danger.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So that's a few things I can think of, but I'd like to know if anyone here has other ideas? Or perhaps an effective way to organise and promote? I feel that it's important we start preparing now so we're ready if the worst does happen - if this sort of thing does get put in place then there's likely no getting rid of it once the initial rage has passed.</p></p>

        <p>OK. So firstly you have to understand the context of the press releases. We are heading into vaxxing the 50 somethings that know they are not at risk of dying from covid. But the 50 somethings do like a few holidays a year and the prospect of losing this is a big sway. There has also been some high profile anti covid personalities taking the vax this week such as jhb and lord suption. Again a demonisation tactic. Like oh, we are losing.</p>
<p>Remembering that UK media and liberal politics has spent the last 50 years grooming a fully inclusive society making discrimination for race, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, religion a taboo. Do you really think they will roll out a straight up vaccine apartheid?</p>
<p>In actual fact I am of the opinion that a vaccine passport will be the least of our worries. The economic meltdown is starting to unravel with the bond market beginning the crash. Debt is a big problem and they are in even more trouble now after the billions of qe and relief spending, most of which has gone to special interest and propping up the stock markets and corporate buy backs. But you can't keep the wolf from the door forever and you can't print hundreds of billions in the uk and trillions in the us without putting up inflation. They are currently hiding this but when the money starts to hit the ground a little more we are going to have a problem. Interest rates will go up, think about mortgages, cars, loans, business loans etc. </p>
<p>In a short time we are going to see real biting inflation. If this happens when a mutated strain of covid hits the immuno primed vaccine takers next autumn, of which there are many, you will see a great deal of death and sickness at the time the economies are collapsing. This will be blamed on covid, not the priming effect of the vaccines and I would imagine the heath services would collapse bacause a ton of that sectors got vaxxed and food and energy shortages will be common. Then the looting will start and cities will become very dangerous indeed. I know this sounds bad, but really a vax pass is the most ridiculous thing to concern yourself with right now. Get a gun, even an air gun, stock up, get a bolt hole if you live in a city, have some cash, prep, food, warmth, fire, light, water. This is going to get a lot worse before it gets better. It's called a reset for a reason.</p>

        <p>Oof well that's some take. I could see it happening I suppose.</p>
<p>Okay, I'm a worrier. After everything that's happened this year, I can't help it. People keep saying don't worry about things that haven't happened yet but honestly I just can't not think about it.</p>
<p>Whether or not the apocalypse reset thing happens, I can see all the debt and economic fallout on the horizon. I'm still in high-school, but when I leave in summer of 2022 I'm going to be thrown headfirst to navigate my way through economic collapse and pick up the pieces of what we shattered this year. Furlough schemes have been extended because no one wants to admit that a lot of those jobs have been lost. I know that when we reopen there will be an awful lot of stuff that isn't there to reopen for a number of years.</p>
<p>What you said about politics and equality is a good point. On the one hand, a lot of that is fuelled by woke culture which supports vaccine passports. On the other hand, discrimination laws might be something we could easily use to target this.</p>

        <p>Don't worry. You are young and hopefully healthy. In a nightmare scenario you will have a huge advantage over those that are compromised in some way. Imagine you are me,  I am strong and prepped but with a wife and two daughters to support and protect.</p>

        <p>Very, very simple. But not easy. You just have to come to terms with the fact that your lifestyle will be different (not worse) moving forward. You have to resign—right now—to never traveling commercially and never participating in public commerce again. Sound impossible? It’s not, and is in fact quite liberating once you take the plunge. It’s liberating because at that point nobody will have any control over you.</p>
<p>The important thing to know is that you will be giving up these things REGARDLESS. Getting vaccinated will not allow you to return to your old ways. The powers that be are using that as a bribe, and many will receive it out of pure desperation, but it will not help them. DECIDE NOW where you stand, and new solutions you never before considered will open up to you.</p>

        <p>That's not what I'm saying. I don't want to give up participating in society. I'm a high schooler, I need to and I want to get out there and enjoy things. Your supposed solution would only work for people who have a job, home and their future settled. It's not a solution at all, it's just giving up.</p>
<p>I was asking for potential things we could do to prevent this from happening at all, so that people wouldn't have to make a decision like that.</p>

        <p>I know exactly what you’re asking. You just don’t like the answer. You don’t want to “give up on society” but unfortunately society has given up on <em>you</em>! Unless you like wearing masks, getting dangerous semi-annual vaccines, receiving regular Covid swabs, and proving your “innocence” everywhere you go, start making arrangements! This isn’t going away.</p>
<p>Think about this analogy: you’re a rebellious teenager, and your controlling parents buy you a car. You can use the car all you want, but don’t “misbehave” or they take the car away... get it? So what’s the solution? DON’T USE THE CAR. It’s just a trap to control you. </p>
<p>Similarly, your government controls you with public benefits that you can’t fathom giving up. You will likely end up getting the vaccine and next year’s vaccine like a good little slave, because you absolutely have to go to your concerts and movies and other nonsense you think is important. The only solution is to say “fuck you, I don’t need that shit.” Then what can they do? Their power is GONE. </p>
<p>Form your own like-minded social groups. Find alternative solutions for travel. Find alternative solutions for money (hint: it’s shiny and metallic and you don’t need permission from your baby-sitter government to own it). There are no shortcuts to freedom. You are still young and in an AMAZING position to adapt that most will not be able to do because they’ve been feeding on the government teat for far too long.</p>
