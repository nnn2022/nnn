    <strong>Help</strong>
    <p><p>I am going into high school, I'm very conservative and I believe that there is no need for me to wear a mask everyday of the week for virus that has almost no cases and a 99.7 % survival rate, plus could be a hoax altogether in an effort to gain control over the people. My mother, however, believes that we have take absolute maximum precautions to protect us from the scary "killer virus". She's completely fallen for the fear mongering that we receive 24/7 to keep us under lock and key. Let me back up, my parents are divorced. My dad tried for 10 years to try to convince my mom that the government didn't have our best interests at mind and that we shouldn't do everything they say and just take their word for everything without even a slightly deeper look into the information. My mom wants to live in a bubble, and she just does whatever they say she has to to do that because she just doesn't want to believe that there are bigger problems at hand then watching Netflix and sitting on the deck. I myself look a little deeper for the truth and understand that there are more sinister things happening in the world than what we see in mainstream media. So there is no we in hell I'm wearing a mask to school and marking myself as a good little sheep who's going to make sure somebody's 97 year old grandmother doesn't die because that's not right around the corner anyway. (maybe a little insensitive bit you get it.) They tell you that you absolutely have to abide to the new normal and if you don't than your evil for wanting to live your life and make a stand. Anyway I just don't know what to say to my mom to convince her that I don't need to wear a mask. Honestly maybe I just drop out. It's mostly indoctrination anyway. Hell, my dad struggled with this problem for 10 years. Please  recommend how I can go about the conversation I will have to have if you can in the comments, persuasion isn't my strong suit. Thanks.</p></p>

        <p>In some states, you don't have to go to school if you're above a certain age (which is why "illegal absences" become "unexcused absences". If you are above your state's age, maybe drop out for a year. I'm sure your mom would love that. I'm shocked to hear that you'll be going to school every day anyway</p>

        <p>If I knew how to post a picture, I would show my son's cloth (formerly white) fabric mask after about 2.5 hours. There is no way it was healthy for him to breathe that petri dish in and out. It's literally brown. Granted he is young, but I doubt most adults are any  less disgusting.</p>
