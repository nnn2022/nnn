    <strong>Illusion of safety</strong>
    <p><p>As I was watching people interact in public yesterday with their strange neurotic tendencies regarding the wuflu, I had an amusing thought. People re-wear their masks all the time right? So if it is true as they say that masks can stop the spread of the virus, doesn't that mean the virus is contained on your mask? Which you then touch multiple times with your hands readjusting and donning on/off? And then you go and open/close doors, touch your face with your mask off when you get in your car/get home? I see this whole thing as such a silly charade of people just pretending they are doing what is right. No different than the TSA security donkey show in the US. Hundreds and hundreds of people packed together in one place waiting to be nice and "safe" to get on a plane. Yet if someone wanted they could just bomb the "security" line and kill very many. It's all just an illusion! </p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with taking certain measures to try to minimize the risk of hurting others. It's probably not a great idea to drive shit drunk. That is dangerous and a high-risk activity, which can be easily avoided. But ruining the entire country's economy and forcing draconian measures of control for some silly virus that has such a high survivability rate is literally insane. Just keep thinking about all of the hypocrisy and ridiculousness and don't be afraid to point it out! I have to wear a mask in the door of the restaurant but then I can go sit down with 8 friends and laugh and smack our fuckin lips together while sitting right by each other? BULLSHIT. That's all it is. So why is BULLSHIT encouraged and TRUTH is not? Let's take our world back.</p></p>

        <p>Yea faxx, like these examples and the other studies proving masks don't work still makes me question why theirs a major push from authorities and government </p>
<p>But as we know, it's created such a divide "anti maskers" "pro maskers" those who don't wear masks are the enemy and also kinda makes everyone silent and comply </p>
<p>The mask shit is an example of a clown world that gets so pissed other people who don't wanna wear a germ infested thin peice of shit</p>

        <p>Technically the mask is single use, but I use mine (it mostly seats in the pocket) at least for a week. I see masks hanging out from cars rear view mirror, on or dashboard. Circus!</p>

        <p>I walked out of Walmart last night, sans mask, and a guy approaching the store suddenly stopped and turned around. I thought, I bet he forgot his mask. Yep, he was parked by me and had to grab it. I wanted to tell him it was ok to go in without it, but I didn't. I was super happy to see another customer in the store also not wearing one, I made a point to tell him that it was nice to see another face. He just laughed.</p>

        <p>You are straight on about average mask usage.  That's really the difference between those who say masks work and those who say masks are silly.   </p>
<p>1) A proper mask, worn and used properly can protect you from an airborn virus.</p>
<p>2) People don't use proper masks or use them properly.</p>
<p>So unless you are buying N95 medical grade masks (and you shouldn't. Save them for medical people)  and doing it right, it's not protecting you.   There is some truth to the protecting others bit.  IF you are infected and IF you are infectious and IF you are in public, then IF you cough or sneeze or spit talk you can spread virus.   In an area with high population density and a prevalence of infection, it can make a difference in the spread.  </p>
<p>A whole 'nother question is even if it does slow spread is it worth it?   There is some truth to the tag:  "A virus so deadly most people need a test to find out they have it."</p>

        <p>Right I pretty much agree with everything you have posted. My issue that is perhaps not as common as to why I am an "anti-masker" isn't so much that I think they do absolutely nothing. I think like you said when used PROPERLY they probably help a bit. My issue is that this phenomenon is a socially engineered catastrophe and is being used to control and manipulate people, and I will NOT support that. And of course the occult symbolism behind it as well.</p>

        <p>Yeah the word for it is cross-contamination. If you can’t keep the mask sterile, you are most likely spreading more infections, not less. And yet, can you really expect anyone to keep a mask sterile? It would require immense concentration while conducting your daily rituals. Can we really blame anyone for getting distracted, touching their mask or scratching their eyes? </p>
<p>No. Not in my opinion. I can’t expect someone who lacks training on proper protocol to suddenly master it, especially when the government does such a piss-poor job of informing the public. </p>
<p>That’s why it should be determined by patient and doctor. Doctors know their patients, their personal biology and temperaments. They are supposed to prescribe treatments and precautionary measures on an individual basis for this EXACT reason, and that’s why the idea of prescribing a blanket treatment to an entire population is ludicrous.</p>

        <p>And as I've been saying for months, stuff like this is why <em>masks do not work</em>.</p>
<p>The critical assumptions going into wearing masks are based on a.) perfect usage, b.) implementation at the beginning of the pandemic, not several months later and c.) actual threats that people are seeing with their own eyes.</p>
