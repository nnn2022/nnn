    <strong>Canadian Border patrol took my 7 month high risk pregnant fiance without allowing me to cross with her</strong>
    <p><p>On april 14, fiance tried to cross the US Canada border. She is a Canadian citizen, I am a US citizen. We were crossing so that we would have the correct health care for her and the baby because she is considered high risk. We live in a school bus together full time , off grid in the woods. </p>
<p>They didn't let me across due to thier stupid covid laws and travel restrictions and took my fiance away by herself to a hotel room to quarantine and effectively making a 7 month pregnant woman homeless until I can cross the border with her. We have immense evidence that she needed me to be with her, we tried to follow all of thier guidelines to cross. We got covid test, both came back negative, we had medical papers, we had a place to do thier mandatory quarantine, we had everything that we thought we needed. </p>
<p>The canadian border guard woman that we talked to was an absolute psychopath. When she wasn't talking to us and was with her coworkers we could hear her laughing about our situation. She and her CO had the audacity to tell us that they were extremely compassionate people. All for a fucking flu that literally has a fucking 98% survival rate. </p>
<p>Ive been in touch now with the paraliment of BC to help me get this straightened out because this is almost a humanitarian issue. Completely insulting to be treated the way that we were, and to be forced away from my fiance who is carrying my first child who needs me to be there with her.</p></p>

        <p>Crazy as they rules are (and I agree with you that they are crazy), you could have foreseen what would happen with Uncle Justin's Secret Police. </p>
<p>The fact that the pair of you even got pregnant during the current cluster-fuck of a shambles, beggars belief.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't say it was the best timing but it happened. We were in northern Idaho when our scout truck broke down about 40 miles into the national forest, we had a pack of wolves circling the truck up on the ridge from us. And there was wine, some very good wine I should add. and a very good deer stir fry with rice</p>
<p>We had no choice but to try and cross. She was no longer legally present here, and we didn't have the right health insurance to make sure she would be safe.</p>

        <p>I agree, this isn't the best time to get pregnant but it is what it is, and frankly, it is none of our business.</p>
<p>The question is now, what to do? I highly suggest an attorney in BC and see what can be done on her behalf. Remember, you are her fiance, so there is very little you can do. Check the immigration laws, and see what can be done on your part, otherwise, it is going to be a very long weekend.</p>
<p>My only other feed back is this, do not put yourselves in situations where you can not control the outcomes. You and your fiance have now learned this lesson the hard way!</p>

        <p>We live in a converted small house school bus together. She was taken to a hotel for mandatory government quarantine for 2 weeks. Once the 2 weeks is up, she will have no where to go they will be just kicking her out to the street unless I can get across the border fairly soon with our bus.</p>

        <p>Dude you live near the border and you're not a citizen, the same would of happened in non-covid times and your wife had a medical emergency. Thankfully your wife got across, now get off Reddit and see who you can call (keep calling any and everyone) and see if in the meantime you can get a telehealth set up so you can be with your wife remotely.</p>
