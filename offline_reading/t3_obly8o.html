    <strong>If somebody claims to "follow the science", ask them to explain scientifically the data we have about the pandemic.</strong>
    <p><p>I guess nobody is able to explain the data we have about this pandemic.  And wouldn't a scientific way of dealing with a pandemic be to first  try to explain the data we have, and only then implement policies based  on those analyses? The countries most affected by the pandemic were the  US and Eastern Europe. But why? I have (and everybody has) heard  countless supposed explanations for COVID-19 mortality differing between  countries, and, for every single one of them, just eye-balling the data  makes it obvious it is not a true explanation. The most common supposed  explanations are non-pharmaceutical interventions such as mask mandates  and lockdowns. Well, first of all, it hardly makes sense to try to put  all non-pharmaceutical interventions into a single variable, it can  obviously be lumping good and bad policies together. It can obviously be  that masks mandates are effective (How do people actually behave when  forced to wear masks? Do they keep them clean enough to be effective?),  but that lockdowns are not, or vice versa (the same is true for many  things in social sciences, such as the Economic Freedom Index advocated  by the Austrian School of Economics, that it lumps good and bad policies  together). Second, Scandinavian countries have done far fewer  non-pharmaceutical interventions than either the US or most countries in  Eastern Europe, yet they have fared much better. US had 11% excess  mortality in 2020, Sweden had only 1.5% excess mortality, whereas  Norway, Denmark and Finland had lower mortality in 2020 than in 2019.  The difference in COVID-19 mortality between countries is caused by  different life expectancies, countries with more elderly people will be  hit more by the pandemic? Well, as appealing as this idea sounds, it is  not supported by the data. Scandinavian countries have significantly  higher life expectancy than the US or the Eastern Europe. And so does  Japan, which also did not have many COVID-19 deaths, and neither did it  have much non-pharmaceutical interventions (though more than  Scandinavian countries). COVID-19 hits countries with highest heart  disease and type-2-diabetes the most? Well, what about Sudan, the  country plagued the most with heart disease and type-2-diabetes, but  having almost no COVID-19? Clearly, that also plays a minor role, if it  plays a role at all. Countries with highest vaccination rate have fewer  deaths from COVID-19? Well, statistics (which I suppose are misleading,  but, nevertheless...) show us otherwise. Countries which get more Sun  (closer to the equator) have less COVID-19 because the UV light from the  Sun kills the virus? Then how are Chile and Seychelles so plagued with  COVID-19, in spite of being close to the equator? Island nations tend to  have much less COVID-19? Again, what about Seychelles? If you cannot  explain those things, what gives you the right to implement your  policies?</p></p>

        <p>You can't compare any of the statistics anyway. The number of tests, type of tests, test procedures, test strategies, definitions of positive and negative results and corona deaths differ from country to country and often even between different laboratories within one country or region. All results from studies based on this data are worthless.</p>

<p>And very important: <strong>PCR-tests can not detect an infection!</strong></p>
