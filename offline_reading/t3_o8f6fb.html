        <p>I was told the link wants you to subscribe so here's what it says...</p>
<p>Getting the COVID-19 shot is an act of love. First, it is an act of love toward yourself. By boosting your natural immunity, you are maintaining the integrity of your body against a devastating, destructive virus that has no business being inside you. The vaccine is like keeping your watchdog healthy, so she has the energy to protect you and keep you safe against invaders while you sleep. COVID-19 viruses are not like the “good” microbes that live and function with your body in harmony. The immunization maintains your natural health against a COVID virus that is a life-destroying, outside invader. Getting the vaccine is an act of love toward the people you care about most. Every one of the millions who have died from COVID-19 could in principle have each pointed their finger to one single person who gave them the virus. Tragically, that one person is often someone emotionally close to them – a friend who felt a little off that day, or the victim’s own child or grandchild who was an asymptomatic carrier. You don’t want to be that person, and you don’t want your children to be that person.</p>
<p>Getting the vaccine is an act of love to the community you live in, filled with people who have suffered personally, financially, and socially as a result of the virus. With this small act, you can do something to love your neighbors. There are times in history we rise to protect others and think beyond ourselves. Collectively, by doing your part, you can do the one thing that can help us all win, and actually wipe this deadly enemy off the planet.</p>

        <p>I can love myself and others without taking an experimental gene therapy. You're right, this is hogwash nonsense. </p>
<p>I wonder how many hours these recipients of this so-called vaccine spend in service to those less fortunate? Or do they just get the jab and say "my job is done"? That's not love, my friends. That's not love.</p>
