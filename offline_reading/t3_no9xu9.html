        <p>I literally begged my college-aged daughter to not get the vaccine without researching my concerns about it and sent both her and her father supporting evidence for my position.  Her dad decided to get Pfizer anyway because "everyone" is saying to do it so surely I must be the one who is wrong.  My daughter who worships her father subsequently chose Pfizer too.</p>
<p>She was okay after the first dose but slept for two days after the second dose a month ago.  She has also been sick twice in the last month, once with a sore throat type illness and now with something that's affecting her stomach, body soreness, feeling chilled to the bone, and is sleeping far more than normal.  This kid never gets sick.  Twice in one month is highly abnormal for her.</p>
<p>Even given all of that one of my greatest concerns was with the spike protein potentially altering her reproductive system.  She's a great kid and would make a terrific mother one day if she chooses to have a child.  I'll be furious if that's no longer an option due to the malicious psychopaths driving the COVID narrative and global vaccination effort.</p>
<p>I'll be apoplectic with rage if these recurring illnesses lead to something worse and will make it my life's mission to expose that cabal and bring it down. Crimes against humanity charges in front of the world on the media they've made complicit in their crimes would be a fine start in unseating them.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry to hear that, it would be terrible if this has any effect on her ability to have a child and for you to be a grandparent some day. If I had a kid I would ensure that they're eating right and getting proper exercise and sleep, because those are the real things that prevent disease of any kind, and the COVID mortality data shows that people who are getting gravely sick from this and spreading it significantly are immunocompromised either from old age or chronic diseases that are largely mediated by lifestyle choices. </p>
<p>I am around your daughter's age and my friends, many of them very healthy and active people with no underlying conditions, got the vaccine as soon as they could, it just doesn't make much sense to me. Why should I not be able to enroll in college courses to further my career if I want to exercise my autonomy and help to reduce spread and sickness in other meaningful ways?</p>

        <p>I would blame her father (and your daughter to a lesser degree) moreso than the globalist cabal. Any intelligent and open-minded individual had the opportunity to research every aspect of this "vaccine" before it was injected into their arms. Evil will always be out there to derail the good, so it's our responsibility to make the right decisions.</p>

        <p>the "opportunity to research" isn't really there considering how quickly they rolled it out, and how little time and background knowledge most people have on this subject.</p>
<p>No-Lifers like me can spend hours piecing stuff together, especially if they have a bit of background in biology, but can't reasonably expect that from everyone.</p>

        <p>People trust authorities and government officials, trust that they have the public's best interests in mind.  I think that way of thinking is naive, but the term "conspiracy theorist" has been so successfully inculcated that many people, most of the people probably, immediately dismiss claims that counter the official narratives.</p>
<p>I agree it's our responsibility to research on our own, but even that is difficult in a sea of official statements "debunking" the opposing views. I view many in this as victims of possibly the greatest propaganda machine I have seen in my lifetime.  Others are complicit but most are victims.   Those who are complicit bank on the public's trust.  This is why I view them as war criminals for crimes against humanity.</p>

        <p>I agree with you but honestly, </p>
<p>there's more people complying than victims or better said, they are at the same time people being fooled and cowards and people that tend consciously towards convenience...</p>
<p>If you investigate 30 minutes about whatever thing being "debunked" you realize that it is (most of times) not debunked, but people 1-don't have time to do that- 2-don't want to spend their life distrusting the sources that makes them feel sure and calm...</p>

        <p>You can call me paranoid but I'm only sharing this info one by one, even if it's plain boring and exhausting,  there's "too many eyes" on reddit and the 50cent army and the AI is firing so hard these times. I will have a watch at your profile/comments and share it with you privately. Also, it is so long and dense to share as a comment. </p>

        <p>Trying to explain to people IRL and on reddit not to get experimental drugs... it's kinda pointless, they don't think for themselves. The UK is getting so authoritarian I might have to get "vaccinated" in Brazil this summer so I can keep living here, people just believe whatever they are told. I'm beginning to think most people don't have actual souls.</p>

        <p>I agree with you.  Many people seem like programmed automatons these days, incapable of critical thought and an inquisitive spark of life.  Lacking a soul.  More like mindless drones for the state.</p>
<p>I was reading recently about VMAT2 inhibitors possibly being in the vaccines (or aerosolized) to attack the "god gene" or centers of spirituality located in the frontal lobe.  I didn't read enough about it yet, but what I read was interesting.  Of course the theory is "debunked" but something like that seems to be going on because people seem a little less human these days.</p>
<p>I hope you don't have to get vaccinated simply to live where you want to be.  We are not livestock, and the freedom of movement is a fundamental human right.</p>

        <p>That's what it's like, they don't even know what they are talking about but feel very strongly about it... I feel like in Brazil you can disagree a lot about something but just decide to be friends and never talk about that one thing, in the UK you're Hitler.</p>
<p>I don't know about that but I don't rule anything out. Personally I think they are out for money and don't give a fuck who lives and fies.</p>
<p>I mean I will pay $500 for a "vaccine" and proof of getting a "vaccine" in Brazil. Being born in a third world country does have some benefits you understand.</p>

        <p>It was their choice, I did all I could do in giving the information.  What they did with it is their own responsibility.  Makes me sad. I hope they're well and that I was wrong to be skeptical.  You're blessed to have a dad who bolstered your position with your mother and sister, and for them actually listening to the information you and your dad provided.</p>

        <p>Yes.  A quick way to go, rather than a protracted one with erectile dysfunction, abnormal menstruation, heart murmurs, facial paralysis, and possibly infertility.  But hey, at least you vaxxers won't be muddying up the gene pool so there's that - bonus!</p>

        <p>COVID spike proteins are different than those encoded from the vaccine, for one they are said to contain a transmembrane anchor region that is supposed to keep them from moving freely around the body, but maybe it's this that causes accumulation in the ovaries?</p>

You are obviously perfectly able to supply with something that at least looks like actual research  so why would you need to add outlandish claims that are conmected to random lines in ancient books? You ever seen the movie 23? That's exactly how people like you act. Drawing connections because you need there to be one. Give it a watch.</p>

        <p>I on the other hand completely agree. It totally sounds ridiculous, why on earth would someone do this?? Until you read the Bible, it’s pretty specific about it. The Antichrist will specifically place a mark in your hand or forehead if you worship him and his world government. Without it, you can’t buy or sell. Which also means you won’t be able to have a job, etc. we’re seeing so many things that ring those bells in our heads. vaccine passports, quantum dot tattoos, microchip technology, etc. </p>
<p>You’re 100% right. It totally sounds insane, but at least we have a guide telling us it’s the most unacceptable thing a Christian can do is accept that mark, and the Bible specifically says it’s the only thing that you can’t be forgiven for.</p>

        <p>Well thank you for explaining to me :) I didnt actually know about that, but i can see how something like that would cause concern for strong believers. It might be something about being from a country where religion isnt as important but i especially think it's interesting about all this devil stuff with the government because as an outsider i know me and a lot of others think that the church and religion has a pretty big influence over there comparetively.</p>
<p>In the end i feel like you should be able to forego the vaccine for your religious believes but i'd probably also be for people not having the vaccine needing a test for a while instead.</p>
<p>And in that sense i dont mind there being a paper to show that you have been tested and checked clear since i feel it's a fair compromise as it keeps the concerns of both sides in check.</p>

<p>&rt;It might be something about being from a country where religion isnt as important but i especially think it's interesting about all this devil stuff with the government because as an outsider i know me and a lot of others think that the church and religion has a pretty big influence over there comparetively.</p>
<p>Yeah absolutely, the church had a huge impact on all sorts of things throughout the years. We’re ending “the church age” currently. The Bible talks about the One world government who will eventually be ran by the AntiChrist, and we’re seeing the United Nations take pretty strong control over stuff now. Established in 1948, so it makes sense that they would incrementally increase their power over time and take full control soon. </p>
<p>&rt;In the end i feel like you should be able to forego the vaccine for your religious believes but i'd probably also be for people not having the vaccine needing a test for a while instead.</p>
<p>You would think. Christianity isn’t “anti-vax” unless for some, that the virus is born on aborted baby cells or something. Not to familiar with that. But this vax isn’t the mark of the beast, so it’s hard for me to get behind the religious argument. My argument is that it’s classified by them as experimental, and I’m not a lab rat.</p>
<p>&rt;And in that sense i dont mind there being a paper to show that you have been tested and checked clear since i feel it's a fair compromise as it keeps the concerns of both sides in check.</p>
<p>If the vaccine worked like it’s supposed to, you would be virtually incapable of catching it. Doesn’t seem to be how it works though, which raise even MORE concerns lol</p>

        <p>I must've misunderstood with the mark, there's so much going around that it's hard to keep track. I know several people who like you feel it's too rushed and are apprehensive but like me would take it to help the short term, though i'll admit a lack of self preservation.</p>
<p>For me that part has been a bit tough because people seem like they both want to open everything and have the virus over with and if it had been up to me we had all just stayed home for a month, maybe a month and a half and then at least we would know if they were faking it but with so many people deciding to either mask or not both sides have had the argument that they're right.</p>
<p>It could be the vaccines not working fully but i also know that many people are already faking their passes to get around without masks and i'm afraid people like that will muddy the results, good or bad.</p>

        <p>Ok, I’ll explain it a bit better. </p>
<p>The Mark of the Beast is a mark placed on the right hand or forearm that symbolizes allegiance to the beast. The Beast is the one world government, ran by the antichrist. He is not in power yet as far as we know, but I 100% believe he will reveal himself soon.
There will be suspicions on who it really is but 3.5 years after, he will make it abruptly clear to those paying attention. He will claim to be God. And after that he will force the mark on people, force you to have it to buy or sell and it’ll be your digital identity, mobile and digital wallet, possibly your credit card, etc. essentially forcing you to take it or become useless in society. </p>
<p>Christians are strictly told not to receive it and you are damned to hell indefinitely if you receive it. The Bible doesn’t say every single person will get it though. You have to worship him, and some will probably be killed when they say no but we’ll see when we get there. </p>
<p>Yeah, there’s a ton of evidence suggesting it’s WAY overblown, death numbers inflated by 50-75%, false positive tests, payments for diagnosing covid, etc, and I’m just overall sick of it personally 😂</p>

        <p>But he/she seemed to take the “I’m not discussing this” approach, and I don’t blame them. It’s hard to wrap your head around. But it’s literally there, in the Bible, written over 1900 years ago and we’re seeing the technology be available to produce such a mark, and the systems in place to control trade and employment as described. The mark of the beast would have absolutely not been possible until the technology was created</p>

        <p>Please actually go read the tweet in this screenshot. Even the guy who posted it says theres absolutely no affect on fertility, according to either this study (which btw was openly published and peer reviewed in China, not leaked) or the EMA metastudy which translated it (there's a link in that tweet thread).</p>
<p>Also the Chinese study was on rats, who have much larger ovaries proportionally.</p>

        <p>Actually go find the tweet in this screenshot and even the guy who posted it says theres absolutely no affect on fertility, according to either this study (which btw was openly published and peer reviewed in China, <strong>not leaked</strong>) or the EMA metastudy which translated it (there's a link in that tweet thread, i'm too lazy to post it here but it's in my other comment on this thread).</p>
<p>Also the Chinese study was on rats, who have much larger ovaries proportionally.</p>

        <p>My daughter (F20) has not had a period since receiving her first shot at the beginning of March. She went to her gyn Dr 2 weeks ago and all tests came out normal. They told her it is just normal and happens sometimes. WTH???!! Regular period since 10yr old and now nothing? Several of her other friends have had issues too, bleeding all the time, period every 10 days, and her coworker also is now period free. The vax makers may be protected from lawsuits but are the marketers, ad agencies, or ppl of status saying go get your shot? I hope to see those ambulance chaser lawyer commercials soon saying, "were you convinced to get your shot by xxx"?, Soon.</p>

        <p>I was unable to convince her not to get it. She wanted to travel again and that was her driving reason to get it. She had Covid in September. Our oldest daughter (F23) also got the shot because she is a nurse. She hasn't had menstrual issues except the 2 weeks after she had her period early and for 3 weeks straight. Back to normal now though. We have one grandson, 9 months old, really hope he won't be the last.</p>

        <p>I have not seen a single real study or statistic making that claim. It's just hundreds of anecdotes "my daughter's friend" and "my second cousin's". And the issues are never the same.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/assessment-report/comirnaty-epar-public-assessment-report_en.pdf">EMA metastudy</a> (this is the link that Dr Ah Kahn posted) overwhelmingly finds by analyzing more than a dozen different <em>independant and peer reviewed</em> studies, that there is absolutely <em>zero</em> effect on fertility or reproductive health, <strong>even in that rats study who administered a 500 times larger dose by body weight.</strong></p>
<p>The famous J&amp;J blood clot problem was an incredibly rare (literally six cases) interaction with a specific birth control, and the seriousness with which that was handled should demonstrate how if <em>anything like that came up the EU wouldn't have come to the conclusion they did in the above study.</em></p>
<p>This is the internet. If you believed every single comment and post at face value you'd go crazy. Skepticism is healthy but the only cure to being skeptical of something is to eventually find someone to trust, and personally I trust the thousands of tirelessly working medical scientists (who's data is cited by the EMA and others) more than I trust a commenter on reddit.</p>

        <p>No one said it negatively effects any of the organs (other than the way that <em>all</em> vaccines cause a brief period of mild symptoms), or even that it has anything to do with "large organs".</p>
<p>The study in question reports that it has higher quantities in rat ovaries than humans because rat ovaries are proportionally larger. Not rocket science. Literally just because the ovaries take up like 2% of their body instead of like 0.02% in humans. Very simple fractions shows that the rats will have way more of <em>anything</em> in their ovaries proportionally, which makes the post above extremely misleading.</p>
<p>It would be like saying "rats have weirdly high concentrations of blood in their ovaries", or "weirdly high concentrations of molecules".</p>

        <p>In P and M brand therapies the mRNA is packaged in small particles of fat (lipids) so that the cells in the body will pick it up. They aren't automatically bad but it might be concerning to have the primary locus of spike production in the ovaries rather than a large muscle group.</p>
<p>Haven't read enough to answer your second question.</p>
<p>Educated guess re: testes - spermatozoa don't carry much in the way of energy sources within them, they rely on fructose in seminal fluid. It would make sense for a mature ovum to pack in as much energy as possible to use for cellular processes and division after fertilization but before implanting in the uterus and gaining access to nutrients furnished by the body.</p>

        <p>Because the study isn't on humans - it's on rats. Compared to humans rats have huge ovaries relative to the size of the rest of their body. It also concluded that there's no evidence to say that the vaccine compromises fertility - something OP mysteriously neglected to mention.</p>

        <p>People still wanna deny this, it is insane.  So you can still get COVID after the vaccine?  Then it's not a vaccine, just codename to remove any liability!

        <p>Perhaps someone understands this better, or can do a better job of explaining it. This is "my understanding" of the table presented. </p>
<p>I don't know its legit - I just found the document the twitter post was referencing online.</p>
<p>It was an experiment conducted on 42 laboratory mice.</p>
<p>Your mRNA gene therapy is two main parts - you have the mRNA and this is attached to something called a "lipid nanoparticle" - you can think of the lipid nanoparticle as a kind of "boat"; it carries the mRNA and allows it to penetrate into cells.</p>
<p>In this experiment, they used the same lipid nanoparticle as is used in the covid jab, but instead of the spike protein mRNA, they used a different mRNA. And, importantly for the experiment, the lipid boat had some radioactive material attached to it.</p>
<p>They inject 3 mice, wait for a certain amount of time, kill the mice, open them up and measure how much radioactivity there is in different parts of the body - </p>
<p>Repeat, new mice, wait a longer amount of time... 15minutes, 1hr, 2hrs, 4hrs, 8hrs, 24hrs, 48hrs.</p>
<p>so its an experiment designed to help understand where the lipid nanoparticles travel after the injection, as time passes.</p>
<p>The results:</p>
<p>At different times, they found different levels of radioactivity in different locations, I've just noted the highest % of the total injected material in each location.</p>
<p>INJECTION SITE = 52.6% dose</p>
<p>LIVER = 18.1% dose</p>
<p>SMALL INTESTINE = 0.9% dose</p>
<p>STOMACH = 0.98% dose</p>
<p>SPLEEN = 1% dose</p>
<p>BRAIN 0.02% dose</p>
<p>HEART = 0.08% dose</p>
<p>OVARIES = 0.09% dose</p>
<p>ADRENAL GLANDS = 0.1% dose</p>
<p>BONE MARROW = ?? estimate ?? 0.025% dose</p>
<p>The rest - different organs, smaller amounts, just highlighting the main ones.</p>

        <p>Yeah even just the table given translates it to percentage on the right (non highlighted) side. The left side of the table is in raw units without a denominator given.</p>
<p>The conclusion that lipids from the injection are "highly sequestered in the ovaries" isn't supported by the table that the poster gives.</p>

<p>I wouldn't say that.</p>
<p>The quantity accumulates steadily over time.</p>
<p>This was tested in mice - I don't think they were "humanised mice" - ie genetically engineered mice with human cells. So cells of different species, are going to be different, drugs will behave differently in different species.</p>
<p>We don't have data for "human females" - more / less accumulation?</p>
<p>If the mRNA is producing toxic spike protein in the cells of the ovary, is there an immune response with inflamation in the ovaries? What are the risks of damage.</p>
<p>I don't think you'll get a "smoking gun" - you get "things we need to research"</p>

        <p>In the time it would have taken to do all these, we would have faced an unbelievably overwhelmed healthcare system and horrible economic hardship allowing a novel virus to sweep through the population. It is a really hard decision that ultimately benefits humanity according to our scientists, medical professionals, and most leaders.</p>
<p>I work in the healthcare industry and think everyone should get the vaccine. But people should have the autonomy to not get poked true. The only other solution is to move everyone who doesn't want to get poked to a different place. To protect the people who are more worried about corona than the vaccine. Since that's not possible this is the outcome. When we live in a society we must do some things for the common good, and that means taking some risks together. If you don't want to do accepted things for common good, live outside the society that demands it.</p>

        <p>A quick search in that document shows the word ovaries has only been used once and it is in this context:</p>
<p>"<em>After IM administration (to rats) of a radiolabeled LNP-mRNA formulation containing ALC-0315 and ALC-0159 to rats, the percent of administered dose was also greatest at the injection site. Outside of the injection site, total recovery of radioactivity was greatest in the liver and much lower in the spleen, with very little recovery in the adrenal glands and</em> <strong><em>ovaries</em></strong><em>.</em> "</p>

        <p>The tweet is (brace yourself) lying. The screenshot is from a Chinese firm whose study was translated and republished in europe (neither publishing was leaked). That EMA document (which Dr Ah Kahn tweeted the same link as above in the thread OP screenshotted) is not a direct study of medical data, but a study of many studies (called a metastudy) which was commissioned by the EU to determine a recommendation (one of many medical recommendations they published) on whether individual countries should deploy the Pfizer vaccine (the EU brand name is Comirnaty).</p>
<p>That EMA document mentions the rat study from the chinese firm with little to no mention of the ovaries because that number was not anomolous in the original study <em>anyway</em> as rats have massive ovaries proportional to their bodies (like 1% of there body vs the 0.01% in humans).</p>
<p>The EMA doc also mentions <em>repeatedly</em> that it found zero effect on fertility or reproductive health, even on the rats who received a <em>five times larger dose</em>. The EMA overwhelmingly recommends the vaccine as safe, and it has dozens of <em>independant  sources</em> of data to back up that recommendation.</p>

        <p>The tweet is (brace yourself) lying. The screenshot is from a Chinese firm whose study was translated and republished in europe (neither publishing was leaked). That EMA document (which, in the thread OP screenshotted, Dr Ah Kahn tweeted the same link as someone else posted below) is not a direct study of medical data, but a study of many studies (called a metastudy) which was commissioned by the EU to determine a recommendation (one of many medical recommendations they published) on whether individual countries should deploy the Pfizer vaccine (the EU brand name is Comirnaty).</p>
<p>That EMA document mentions the rat study from the chinese firm with little to no mention of the ovaries because that number was not anomolous in the original study anyway as rats have massive ovaries proportional to their bodies (like 1% of there body vs the 0.01% in humans).</p>
<p>The EMA doc also mentions repeatedly that it found zero effect on fertility or reproductive health, even on the rats who received a five times larger dose. The EMA overwhelmingly recommends the vaccine as safe, and it has dozens of independant  sources of data to back up that recommendation.</p>

A source. I need a source.<br>
Sorry, I mean I need a source that explicitly states your argument. This is just tangential to the discussion.<br>
No, you can't make inferences and observations from the sources you've gathered. Any additional comments from you MUST be a subset of the information from the sources you've gathered.<br>
You can't make normative statements from empirical evidence.<br>
Do you have a degree in that field?<br>
A college degree? In that field?<br>

No, it doesn't matter how close those data points are correlated. Correlation does not equal causation.<br>

        <p>Is all your data points used to formulate your opinion the accumulation of Twitter screenshots? Wanting to read the full study is never a bad thing. Especially in a world where propaganda and data supression is actively used.</p>
<p>Edit: The mentioned study implies vaccine accumulation. This would be a direct causal relationship as its foreign to the body.</p>

        <p>To be clear: this study was not leaked and it was not by the EMA. It was published and peer reviewed by a Chinese agency, and <a href="hhttps://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/assessment-report/comirnaty-epar-public-assessment-report_en.pdf">the EMA translated it and included it in a meta-analysis which you can read here on the official EMA website where it was openly published.</a></p>
<p>The original study of these organ distributions are also in <em>rats</em> not humans, because the study was done on an extremely early stage of the vaccine, as explained by the EMA document linked above. The document also says that in future studies done on humans, only two organs have greater than 1% concentration, which are the liver (21%) and spleen (1.1%). All others are ≤ 0.1%.</p>
<p>Also both the EMA and the original study concluded that this was to be expected given the large relative size of rodent ovaries, and that vaccines concentrate in areas of high blood circulation as they spread through the blood stream, which is why the other areas of high concentration are the pituitary, thyroid, and much higher than those are the liver and spleen, whose jobs are to filter blood and fluids.</p>
<p>And even given alllll that, it says <em>nothing</em> to imply any danger to those organs whatsoever. The EMA document covers multiple studies and found no effect on fertility or other long-term disease within a 0.01% margin of error, and mentioned that there was no effect on <strong>the rats <em>either</em>, despite taking 500x dose-size relative to humans by body weight</strong>.</p>
<p>The EMA mentions in the conclusion and throughout the document that based on dozens of peer-reviewed studies that the vaccine was extremely safe and effective. The <em>only" danger they mention is in people with autoimmune diseases or who are already taking medication that hinders the immune system, </em>but we already know that those people cannot safely take any kind of vaccine, not just the covid one*.</p>

        <p>Hey! </p>
<p>Hope my comment doesn’t get lost but I don’t know if people are correctly underastanding what this information actually means.  These studies are done in the very early stages of studying any sort of drug so it’s a common practice.  These PK studies are done in order to, as a baseline, figure the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where does the drug go?</li>
<li>Is it going where it needs to be for its intended purpose?</li>
<li>What concentration/level of the drug is on which organ?</li>
<li>How much of the drug is in the body at certain time points?</li>
</ul>
<p>Among other more specific things.  Basically, it’s a “Where’s Waldo?” study.  </p>
<p>Now, the important bit is this.  These studies do NOT indicate ANY negative effects to those organs.  What do I mean by this?</p>
<p>Imagine someone made a miracle drug that cures any and all blindness (or that’s the dream).  The form the drug is administered is an eye drop as we want it to work on the eye. There is a chance that for whatever the reason it ends up in the LIVER instead of the EYE. This is an issue because it means the compound is in the wrong spot and thus not actually doing what its meant to do.  Here is a big BUT.  This does NOT mean now the liver has eyesight.  </p>
<p>THAT is what this study is testing.  Where is the vaccine going?  It doesn’t show ANY side effects at all.  Additionally, if you read the data, you can see that all the quantities are wonderfully minute.  Aka, we have AMAZING detecting skills that can trace even the smallest amounts of any sort of substance and in this case that’s what they found. In science, you can’t just say “Oh welp, the number is itty bitty so let’s not report it.” If you do you get fired, jailed, all credibility revoked, AND blacklisted from ever working in the community.</p>
<p>So be aware, this post is fear mongering! Or at the very least implying something wildly inaccurate.  </p>
<p>Thanks for my TED talk.  </p>
<p>&rt;    TL;DR  this study does NOT show that the ovaries are being damaged nor that there is a chance that they are being damaged.  All it shows is how the vaccine is distributed in the body (and not even but that’ll take a whole ass other post so that’s the simple version).</p>

        <p>They’re using a special chemical label (3H) to track where the vaccine goes in the body once it’s administered. The results are showing that the vaccine components tend the accumulate more highly in the ovaries, spleen and lymph nodes. It’s very important to note that this doesn’t mention anything about side effects.</p>

        <p>The tweet is (brace yourself) lying. The screenshot is from a Chinese firm whose study was translated and republished in europe (neither publishing was leaked). The study was done on rats, not humans. The EMA published a <a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/assessment-report/comirnaty-epar-public-assessment-report_en.pdf">seperate document (which Dr Ah Kahn tweeted this link as his source</a>) is not a <em>direct</em> study of medical data, but a study analyzing the validity many studies together (called a "metastudy"). This document was commissioned by the EU to determine a recommendation (one of many medical recommendations they published) on whether individual countries should deploy the Pfizer vaccine (the EU brand name is Comirnaty).</p>
<p>That EMA document mentions the rat study from the chinese firm with little to no mention of the ovaries because that number was not anomolous in the original study anyway. Rats have massive ovaries proportional to their bodies (like 1% of there body vs the 0.01% in humans). In the actual analysis tracking <em>human</em> bodies, the concentration is equatable to all other similarly sized organs.</p>
<p>The EMA doc also mentions repeatedly that it found <em>zero</em> effect on fertility or reproductive health, even on the rats who received a <em>five times larger dose.</em> The EMA overwhelmingly recommends the vaccine as safe, and it has dozens of independant sources of data to back up that recommendation.</p>

        <p>I think this is either made up or some misquoted data.  </p>
<p>How would they know distribution of that material unless they performed an autopsy.  Is this data from rat autopsies?  Doesn’t necessarily mean it would be the same in humans. </p>
<p>Would need to link to the original paper for this to make any sense or draw any conclusions from it. </p>
<p>I already anticipate this will generate hate from the conspiracy theorists. Just downvote, I honestly think these hack pieces, make your theories less believable. If you want to be believable post facts,
not a screen shot with no information.</p>

        <p>&rt; How would they know distribution of that material unless they performed an autopsy.</p>
<p>We do this all the time with MRI and CAT scans,  you just need a contrasting/isotopic agent that can bind to the material being studied,  then you can literally watch the flow of material through the body using imaging.  That's what the [3H]-Labelled means at the top of the report.</p>
<p>&rt; Would need to link to the original paper for this to make any sense or draw any conclusions from it.</p>
<p>It's <a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/assessment-report/comirnaty-epar-public-assessment-report_en.pdf">not super hard to find</a>,  given that it has a unique report number right on the image.</p>
