    <strong>Woman arrested for refusing to wear a mask in Melbourne, Australia.</strong>
    <p><p>Masks are mandatory in my city - Melbourne - and have been since Wednesday this week. As in, mandatory at all times, everywhere outside, unless you're running/jogging or can prove (with a certificate) you have a medical condition.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/victoria/police-retail-employees-clash-with-victorians-refusing-to-wear-face-masks-20200726-p55fmi.html">https://www.smh.com.au/national/victoria/police-retail-employees-clash-with-victorians-refusing-to-wear-face-masks-20200726-p55fmi.html</a></p>
<p>(In the interests of honesty, the article says "attempted to take her into custody". I'm pretty sure that means arrested though, doesn't it? I want to be sure.)</p>
<p>My city has gone to shit.</p>
<p>The government has some amazing quotes:</p>
<p><em>Deputy Chief Medical Officer Nick Coatsworth said he wasn’t convinced by the argument that wearing a mask impinged on people’s civil rights.</em></p>
<p><em>“The idea it [wearing a mask] is an imposition on someone’s freedom or individual rights, I’m not sure I can be convinced of that," Dr Coatsworth said.</em></p>
<p><em>“That sort of behaviour has to stop. I acknowledge wearing a mask can be difficult and it takes some time to get used to but, in all seriousness, it is just having a mask on.”</em></p>
<p>Yep, being forced to wear a mask, not being allowed to travel out of the city bounds, not being able to see your friends, not being able to use any businesses because they're all closed, not being allowed outside without a valid reason, not being able to congregate in groups of more than 2 people, not being able to see family members - isn't imposing on your freedoms. It'S jUsT hAvInG a MaSk oN LoL</p>
<p><em>" [Premier Daniel Andrews] said that although police do have the power to issue $200 fines [plus they can and have issued MANY $1652 fines for being outside without a "valid" reason], “it should never ever come to that".</em></p>
<p><em>“They are trying to be as fair as they possibly can be,” he said, “but if you’re just making a selfish choice based on your belief, your personal belief, quoting something you’ve read on some website, it's not about human rights,” he said."</em></p>
<p>Yep, "fuck your human rights". He literally just said fuck your human rights. Just came right out and said it. Am I tripping balls? The person in charge of our state literally declared that he doesn't care about human rights - because he doesn't think this issue is a human rights issue?</p>
<p>What. The. Hell.</p>
<p><em>Police issued a total of 126 fines to individuals for breaching the CHO directions [mandatory mask wearing directions].</em></p>
<p>That's 126 fines in 4 days, by the way. The mandatory mask laws only just came in on Wednesday.</p>
<p><em>A total of 165,412 spot checks have been conducted since March 21.</em></p>
<p>Yep. 165,412 "spot checks". We also have the army going around knocking on people's doors to make sure they stay inside, and patrolling outside:</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/ppijdg9wdad51.jpg?width=650&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d960134d16fe004d0d3e9595cc4c5521b54232ee</p>
<p>They call this "<a href="https://www.premier.vic.gov.au/police-out-in-force-across-melbourne-and-mitchell-shire/">Operation Sentinel</a>", what a lovely phrase. According to their own government website:</p>
<p><em>"issued a total of 6,314 fines as part of Operation Sentinel. Anyone who breaches these directions faces on-the-spot fines of $1,652 for individuals and $9,913 for businesses."</em></p>
<p>Again, <em>that's only in my state alone</em> - not the entire country of Australia.</p>
<p><strong>Welcome to fascism.</strong></p>
<p>And all of this because my state has had <strong>71 deaths</strong>, <em>almost all of whom have been in their 80's or 90's</em> (and a couple aged over 100!!) At that point, if you count that as a corona death, you're actually just taking the piss. You're not even <em>trying</em> to be objective or serious at that point.</p></p>

<p>Insane. I hope the ones responsible spend the rest of their lives in prison when sanity comes back. There should be some sort of Nuremberg trials worldwide.     </p>
<p>The most disappointing is the cops tho. I never expect anything from politicians, but cops fining and arresting just cause <em>those are the orders</em> is pathetic. That shows you who they work for.</p>

        <p>Yeah cops are disgusting me.  165,412 spot checks - that's just in my state alone (not in the entire country). They also bragged about something they called "Operation Sentinel", where they literally knocked on people's doors to harass them:</p>

        <p>It's hard to protest when that means a $1652 fine for being outside without a valid reason + $200 if you also don't wear a mask.</p>
<p>I'll join the first protest that starts, but I genuinely don't feel safe <em>starting</em> one. I literally haven't left the house <em>even one single time</em> since the mask laws came in. I'm definitely not going out there to start a protest and get myself assaulted/stabbed/worse.</p>
<p>If a protest starts, <em>I'll absolutely fucking join</em>. I'm just not going to be the lone wolf to start it.</p>

        <p>Mate, I'm not wearing one at my workplace due to health reasons, but even with a medical reason the pressure to wear one is absolutely insane.</p>
<p>I got a real good sense of what fascism feels like after my first maskless shift. It's silent but threatening. I'm just waiting for people to turn.</p>

        <p>I hear you. I feel the same. Restrictions aren't that bad here in London but I still think people should be protesting mask mandates and random rules like Leicester's lockdown and the new Spain quarantine. </p>
<p>I totally get you though, I don't even know where to start making a protest. that's why I keep posting about it here in the hope that someone more organised than me can come up with something and I'll wholeheartedly help out but don't know where to start. </p>
<p>Here the fine is £100 which I'll pay if that's what it takes to spread truth. .</p>

        <p>Thanks - I'm ok, because I have a couple friends and a girlfriend who all oppose this and we're supporting each other. I feel truly <em>awful</em> for all of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the single people</li>
<li>all the people who feel alone</li>
<li>anyone in domestic abuse situations</li>
<li>all the small businesses who've lost their livelihoods</li>
<li>people who've lost their jobs</li>
<li>people who don't know this sub exists and feel gaslit, like maybe they're the one who's in the wrong for not wanting socialism/fascism</li>
<li>people who are battling mental health issues</li>
<li>people who have addiction issues (alcohol, drugs, porn, etc) and have lost their sobriety (I struggled with this myself, lost my sobriety and am not sober again).</li>
<li>people who are seriously contemplating suicide because they don't see any way out of this.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm ok. But a <em>shitload</em> of people aren't, and what deeply disturbs me is <strong>nobody seems to give a shit about them.</strong></p>

        <p>Glad you’re okay. You’re right about it being difficult to those people. If you find those people, perhaps you could point them to places like this so they know there are others out there. </p>
<p>It’s just hard to organize <em>against</em> this stuff. Our group is disparate and fractured with no real way to find each other. While the hysterical people (and crap health officials) are being catered to. I feel like there’s more people who don’t care and don’t want all this. </p>
<p>It actually sounds worse than a dictatorship - those probably let their citizens <em>go outside</em>. lol hope it’s over soon. We need better ways of organizing against insanity like this.</p>

        <p>What can one do about all this? </p>
<ol>
<li>Encourage <a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/covid-19-masks-on-or-off/">respect for evidence-based</a> decision-making, as well as the <a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/">clear separation</a> of science from politics, to prevent epidemiology and biomedical science from repeating the saga of [Lysenkoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysenkoism#:~:text=Lysenkoism%20(Russian%3A%20%D0%9B%D1%8B%D1%81%D0%B5%CC%81%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%89%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0%2C%20tr,benefits%20of%20vernalization%20and%20grafting.); </li>
<li>Do not support public health policies driven by fear, superstition, pseudoscience, or motivated cherry-picking of the available research - see <a href="https://architectsforsocialhousing.co.uk/2020/06/11/the-science-and-law-of-refusing-to-wear-masks-texts-and-arguments-in-support-of-civil-disobedience/">here 1</a> and <a href="http://ocla.ca/ocla-recommends-civil-disobedience-against-mandatory-masking/">here 2</a>;</li>
<li>Familiarize yourself with the legal protections you already have in your respective country and invoke them when needed - <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/hui1nd/of_masks_lockdown_and_canada_and_the_violation_of/">here 1</a>, <a href="https://www.jccf.ca/mandatory-masking-requirements-represent-an-interference-with-personal-autonomy/">here 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.muskokapost.com/post/ontario-lawyer-files-lawsuit-against-feds-province-cbc-over-covid-19-measures-masks">here 3</a> you have examples of these protections for those living in Canada. Based on your local legal framework, write to your elected officials expressing your dismay at how a form of medical treatment - mask-wearing - is forced on people in violation of their right to informed medical consent. Express your worries that your jurisdiction will soon become like North Korea (where you get <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8549463/North-Koreans-given-three-months-hard-labour-not-wearing-Covid-19-facemasks.html?ito=social-twitter_mailonline">three months of forced labor</a> if you don't wear a mask) or Indiana (where you get up to <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/indiana-face-masks-misdemeanor-eric-holcomb-1519982">six months in prison</a>) or Quatar (where you get up to <a href="https://english.alarabiya.net/en/coronavirus/2020/05/17/Coronavirus-Up-to-three-years-in-prison-for-not-wearing-face-mask-in-Qatar">three years in prison</a>) for not wearing a mask). Protesting anonymously on Reddit is not effective - you need to come forward with your real name in real life and act against this madness through your non-compliance and through your contacting of your elected officials; </li>
<li>In these times, some woke people made a hobby out of mocking those who cherish and insist on civil rights. They are becoming a serious issue precisely because so many people today treat them as a <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8549463/North-Koreans-given-three-months-hard-labour-not-wearing-Covid-19-facemasks.html?ito=social-twitter_mailonline">non-urgent</a> matter, subservient to some <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/496981-hygienic-fascism-turning-the-world-into-a-safe-space-but-at-what-cost">collective illusion of safety</a>.

        <p>I grew up knowing the stories of family members who died or survived the holocaust. Family members died in the concentration camps. One family group was being hidden by a friend of theirs and the neighbour reported them to the authorities. Even Nazi Germany didn't go extremism so quickly. They eased the population into it. It didn't go from 0 to 100 overnight. </p>
<p>TLDR this paragraph is a summary of some awful things people were complicit with during the holocaust
&rt;People always say that if they had lived during that time there, they would <strong><em>never</em></strong> have gone along with it. Never have supported the oppression and persecution of Jewish people. Never have fallen for the propaganda or been driven by fear. Would never have supporter Jewish people being barred from working in civil service jobs or boycotted Jewish businesses. Would never have supported attempts for their livelihoods being destroyed or being forced to register their wealth. They would never have cut off their Jewish friends. They would never have supported the Jewish people being forced to wear yellow stars for identification or them being punished when caught without a badge by fines, imprisonment, beating, or being shot to death. They would never have fallen for the fear, intimidation, and brutality imposed by those in power. They would never have come to fear Jews or believe the lies and prejudice put forth by the nazis in power. They wouldn't have been indoctrinated to accept it, or been so fearful they accepted it.  They would never have accepted Jewish people being taken from their homes and the streets and put in concentration camps. Never would they have followed those in authority right into the holocaust. They would never have supported the creaction of a new society where they were superior and Jews had no place.]</p>
<p>They would never have accepted even the basic premises of the regime. NEVER. They would not have been complicit in the holocaust and what was done to Jewish people even at the start. They would absolutely never have been one to report their neighbour's for hiding Jewish people...</p>
<p>They claim <em>I would have been one of those who harboured Jewish people or helped them to safety</em>. They would have been a free thinker. </p>
<p>Just as they claim in <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/milgram.html">Milgram's famous experiment</a> on obedience to authority, they would have been in the minority who rebelled and did not press that button to continue giving electric shocks of increasing severity while a person screamed, right up until the point it was stated the volts were so high it had DANGER SEVERE SHOCK written. They would not have been like 100% of participants who pushed the button up until 300v.</p>
<p>In the [Stanford Prison]experiment](https://www.simplypsychology.org/zimbardo.html) if they had been the guards they would <strong><em>never</em></strong> have done the <em>horrific</em> things done by those participants. </p>
<p>Or in the <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/asch-conformity.html">Asch conformity experiment</a> where participants were in the room with confederates (fake participants) and had to judge which lines shown - an easy task with obvious answers. They would have been among the 25% who <em>never</em> conformed because they're not that silly, they'd see the obvious answer and would never second guess themself based on group. They would have disagreed with the majority and done so readily!</p>
<p><em>Yet they would not have been. Especially seeing how easily they are impacted by groupthink, herd mentality, mass hysteria, induced fear, in-group out-group, obedience to authority, and conformity...</em></p>
<p>This may not be the holocaust, but it's a display of the psychological phenomena that allowed it to happen along with other terrible events in the past. I don't want to imagine the outcome had Hitler had access to the internet, main stream media of today, and social media...</p>
<p>Immense irreversible harm has been done by this to millions and millions of people. Billions are impacted actually around the world. People are dying and will continue to around the world as result for years to come. All in the name of a virus that is harmless to the majority, that we knew very early on the groups at risk, and has a tiny infection fatality rate. </p>
<p>Those targeting those who leave their homes, who don't stay 1.5m away (or whatever the random distance in various countries) from others,  who are reporting their neighbours and others to authorities, who are attacking those with mental illnesses and medical conditions that mean they cannot wear masks, who are labelling those who don't conform (distance, not socialise, isolate, stay home, wear masks, be as afraid as they are) and psychopaths and sociopaths and attacking them... who are sharing hateful divisive harmful things on social media... </p>
<p>I've lost all respect for them.</p>

        <p>Same. Just same. I deleted Facebook because muting people wasn't enough anymore  - after 30 days they would reappear displaying the same horror behaviour often with a masked face as their profile photo which freaks me out.

        <p>Man I’m so fucking sorry. The US has its problems but nowhere is like this currently and it enrages me as a freedom-loving American to see Aussies living under this militarized police state over something like Covid. If I could bring you all here to kick it in Arizona where we are chillin, I absolutely would. I know empty platitudes like “stay strong” seem meaningless right now so I’ll say this: stay alive and fight every day to move forward so that one day you get to see these people indicted for your state’s torture.

        <p>I'm coming to America as soon as the borders are open. I understand that might be a few years away now (my state is talking about travel, especially international travel, being off the table for the next few <em>years</em>.) But as soon as I'm able, I'm coming to the land of the free and the home of the brave.</p>
<p>Australia (well, in particular Victoria/Melbourne) have shown me they care nothing for freedom and they're entirely fascist/socialist. Well, you can have your socialism - maybe this time it'll work out for once, instead of killing tens of millions of people. Good luck, I won't be here to watch the experiment play out.</p>

        <p>I'm from Alabama/Georgia and I also lived in Australia for a few years. Australians and American Southerners are actually quite similar culturally, especially rural Australians. You'd have no problem making friends if you moved to the northern exurbs of the Atlanta metro area. There's even an Australian bakery in Marietta that sells meat pies, Tim Tams, and Anzac biscuits.</p>

        <p>I will seriously consider suicide if we are to be held captive in our country for years. Travel for me is life. My family and many friends are overseas. I'm a dual citizen in Europe. </p>
<p>In a few years I will be in my 30s. My 20s and youth over. I won't be able to travel for years to all the places I plan on if I want to have a family. That would force me to choose one or the other. My grandparents would possibly be dead by then. </p>
<p>FREEDOM IS LIFE. </p>
<p>The ability to travel is life. Even when you're not travelling, knowing you can travel and leave your country to experience another is important. Our country would suffer without tourists and some places would just collapse. </p>
<p>This mentality of holding people captive on this island is triggering my trauma from when I was held captive for a brief time. This is not okay. Free movement is important.</p>

        <p>Don't kill yourself.</p>
<p>That said, I know exactly how you feel. Every sunday was "Roadtrip Day" for my girlfriend and I - we had it in our calendars every single week. It was our chance to get out of the city, to go somewhere new, usually on long train rides but sometimes by car too. We've visited so many small towns, so many wonderful countrysides, met so many amazing people, been to so many nice places all around the entire state.</p>
<p>We looked forward to those sundays; they were a reward for a week of hard work (we're both in our second year of building our own businesses). We even left our phones at home every single time; it was chance to switch off, our one day of rest before we got back into 15 hour workdays and the stress of not knowing if we can pay the bills this week (building a business <em>ain't fucking easy)</em>.</p>
<p>Now there's nothing to look forward to every week. The weeks all blend into each other, and it's very hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel.Doubly so because I'm not going outside at all (I refuse to wear a mask... I just can't do it. I've tried putting one on - it's like my body won't let me. I have a VERY violent response, like I'm being violated or abused. Staying inside is my only option at the moment).</p>
<p>So I feel you, I know exactly what you're going through - being "stuck" feels like being imprisoned. I totally get it. I really do.</p>
<p>And I'm sorry you have to go through this shit. It's really, really, really fucking evil.</p>

        <p>When I say consider, I don't mean that I will. It's a strong feeling I have, having almost died to suicide a few years ago after a trauma. I do feel like it's not worth life now, and watching people be complicit and encourage the extreme harm being done just... our government literally being our captors, able to do whatever they wish. This isn't a world I wish to be in. </p>
<p>Unfortunately I've lost people to suicide as a result of this. Working in mental health i know more in my area have died via suicide than the virus and I've had more clients attempt or end up in hospital suicidal or severely unwell. They represent younger lives with greater YLL (years of life lost) and no one cares about anything except covid despite suicide being the top cause of death for 15-44 year olds and third for 44-64 year olds. It is tunnel vision. They only see COVID. </p>
<p>I don't want the last of my youth, my youth before having a family and all that, sacrificed because some 70-80-90 year olds (mostly above 80) might die from this virus, as they might have also died from influenza and pneumonia, or their medical condition (the majority of deaths from covid have life limiting comorbid conditions). One elderly woman here is counted as a death but she didn't die of covid and had zero symptoms. It didn't contribute to her death, she was dying.</p>
<p>I don't want my health, wellbeing and ability to live my life as I wish to sacrificed for those who are unfortunately nearing death. If wanting to live and travel and have freedom to leave my house and socialise and actually LIVE is selfish then I am selfish.</p>

        <p>Yeah I understand that. I'm currently starting over because my ex decided she didn't want kids, so I very acutely feel your pain on how this has impaired every young person's ability to move forward in his or her life.</p>
<p>Just remember, though, you can still travel with children. It's different, since you can't exactly go clubbing or mountain climbing, but you also get to make memories and see all those places with your kids. My parents took my whole family on road trips when I was a kid and I cherish those memories.</p>

        <p>I travelled with my parents as a child, and would do so with mine if I can afford it. But it's not the kind of travel i live for, that is wildly without plans travelling and wandering and going wherever I want. Getting lost. Midnight wandering. Meeting strangers. The freedom. You cant get that with kids. It's not the same. You have little people to worry about and consider.</p>
<p>Travel is hard for me with my physical health and I don't see myself managing well with the extra exhaustion of children on planes and etc. I barely cope with just myself, but push myself regardless as it's worth it. Nevermind with children and all that luggage.</p>
<p>Hope you find someone who wishes to have kids. I'm not finding that easy myself.</p>

        <p>I can't handle even hearing about what is happening in Victoria as I fear NSW is only just behind them.</p>
<p>Also masks are bullshit and it's not just a mask and it also means that those who cannot wear one are constantly harrassed by the army, police, and general public. Its a nightmare. None of these measures are <em>just</em> anything. It's extremism for a virus that is a fact of life now and will always exist. A virus with a tiny IFR. Yet you've placed everyone under house arrest, and you are harming people en masse and harming their health - for what? What is the end game?</p>

        <p>I officially deleted Facebook because people are hateful. Even wishing others luck on ventilators for not following ridiculous restrictions imposed unsupported by evidence. I mean joke is on them, if that person had (or has already had) covid they won't end up on a ventilator.  They talk as if hospital is a given, ICU on life support happens to all including the majority of younger people.</p>
<p>Yesterday a friend shared something implying those who refuse to wear masks are psychopaths. Her and others were sharing photos from social media of others in other countries or Melbourne (the only place here with masks) not wearing them and activity shaming them and wishing for them to end up on ventilators. There are many reasons people cannot wear masks... my mum's friend in another country who fled domestic violence cannot wear them because of trauma and mental illness (like me) and wrote a heartfelt post about how she cried when she went shopping because of the glares and horrible comments, and nasty things said to her, and people demanding to know her exact medical reasons for an exception. </p>
<p>I deleted her and then deleted Facebook. I'm done with people. Oh and at least one of our local covid deaths was an elderly woman with zero symptoms and covid didn't contribute to her death, yet she's counted...</p>

        <p>It's only Victoria (my state) that requires masks. We have 77 deaths, all of them old people. Masks became mandatory when we had roughly around 60 deaths. Lockdowns were mandatory when we had like 8 deaths (roughly - I could be off by a tiny bit. But it should be somewhere around 8.)</p>

        <p>On a serious note, there's advertising campaigns on billboards in the city that say something to the effect of "Being locked down is no excuse to lash out." Not that I will EVER condone domestic violence, but the government locked a bunch of people up - and then is surprised when a number of those people turn on each other?</p>

        <p>I don't live in Vic, but I'm constantly hearing that Victorians "need to do the right thing" - wtf does that even mean?? Or that "they should've locked down harder" when they had the harshest lockdowns in Aus??? People have lost their minds and seem to be on a power trip that their state did better than Victoria. It's insane the hysteria that has overtaken us in Australia. </p>
<p>We live next to the Vic border but from Wednesday south Australians won't be allowed back into the state if they came from Vic - how is that even legal?? How can people actually be prevented from going to their homes??? </p>
<p>The day borders open I am getting on a plane out of this country, I don't care how much the ticket costs. Everyone around me thinking it's actually possible to eradicate this virus is driving me crazy.</p>

        <p>"Do the right thing" is what you say to someone when you have contempt for them, and you think you're better than them. Like they're a naughty little plebe who's not following the rules. Kind of like this thing being plastered all over our billboards:</p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/31Hgm1X">https://imgur.com/31Hgm1X</a></p>
<p>That's literally on MASSIVE billboards around the city. Imagine seeing that towering over you as you go outside to buy some milk. <strong>WHAT ARE YOU DOING, GO HOME.</strong> If that doesn't show contempt for us, I don't know what does.</p>
<p>Oh and this double-think insanity:</p>

<p>Basically, "Up is down and down is up".</p>
<p>Yeah at this point I have no idea what we could be doing better - there's nobody outside. Nobody really has been outside in the last 2 months. Everybody is wearing masks. Everybody's getting tested. The government, especially the premier, hate us.</p>
<p>Yep I'm with you - I already have plans to leave to USA as soon as I'm able. In the mean time, I already have plans to escape the city and move to the country, for "health reasons". I'm getting the fuck out.</p>

        <p>And isolation impacts health in many ways and not just mental health but physical health as you have pointed out. The two intertwine.</p>
<p>It is well known that isolation and loneliness increases morbidity and mortality across the board.</p>
<p>Isolation, as you said, reduces the immune system and immune response. Some studies even show isolation and loneliness reduces the immune response following vaccination (e.g. flu vaccine) limiting the effectiveness.</p>
<p>Elderly people who are isolated have higher hospitalization and readmissions including for respiratory illness... </p>
<p>Then there's the impact of stress and trauma and job lose and the economy... economy is directly linked to morbidity and mortality. </p>
<p>Studies from other countries show children have gained weight...</p>

        <p>I’m miserable about it. My friends in support of masks and Dan Andrews’ decisions. But this country was okay with locking people in towers and preventing them from going outside so what is masks to them. Our terrible scientists are pushing for ‘elimination’ and the public is pushing for stage 4.</p>

        <p>Yeah the tower thing was a human right's travesty. And nobody gives two shits about it.</p>
<p>The elimination strategy is the most insane thing I've ever heard. For some reason Dan Andrews has gotten obsessed with this corona thing and he can't (or won't) see anything else. Literally nothing else matters to him - not suicides, not mental health, certainly not freedom and definitely not dignity. Economy doesn't matter, neither does the wellbeing of families, nor the mentally-ill or anyone who's suffering.</p>
<p>It's like he's decided the only thing that matters is COVID. He should be the minister of COVID, not the premier. He's completely neglecting - and actively <em>harming</em> - every other facet of the state he's supposed to be in charge of. It's really really strange to watch; is he autistic? And I mean no disrespect to people with autism - what I mean is he's focusing on ONE thing whilst forgetting the outside world is there, and he doesn't even seem to realise he's doing it. Growing up I had 2 mates who were autistic, and the same thing happened with them a billion times - they'd get so hyper-focused on one thing they completely forgot I was even standing there talking to them. It was like they couldn't even hear me.</p>
<p>Dan Andrews doesn't even know there's a world going on outside COVID.</p>

        <p>I hope it happens. I genuinely really do. I don't want them to die (well, actually that's a lie, if I'm honest with myself I don't like to admit it but I do). But maybe if there's a protest or something, or a <em>little</em> bit of violence against government property/government officials/army/police, people will be shaken out of this weird <em>complacency coma</em> they've all fallen under.</p>
<p>I don't want riots, I don't want death. I just want... <em>something</em>. Anything. Something that isn't compliance. It's pathetic as hell but my own "rebellion" is staying at home - I literally haven't left the house since Wednesday, and I will not. I refuse to wear a mask, so therefore I just won't go outside. You could argue I'm only hurting myself by doing so, but at least there's one less mask walking around outside.</p>

<p>I'd like to, but I'm literally IN the city. I live on Elizabeth St - the main city. There's people/cameras/police/etc here more than anywhere else. I don't feel all that safe going outside.</p>
<p>That said, staying in my apartment isn't a long-term solution. At some point I'll break, and start going outside. At that point, if you give me poster designs, I'll print them myself and put them up around the place. I've already seen a few posters (there was one in Richmond a month ago) questioning this shit.</p>

        <p>To be fair we already <em>kinda</em> were - at least in Melbourne. Ok we weren't communist, but there's monthly marches and protests in the city advocating for socialism. The "Melbourne Socialist Alliance" are INCREDIBLY popular here in the city, especially amongst university students. There's posters for socialism spread all throughout the city, they put them on billboards, on poles around the city, on businesses, etc. A tonne of people want universal basic income, and a tonne of people have jumped at the chance to grab all that "free" money the government is handing out right now.</p>
<p>So this was probably coming... it just wasn't supposed to happen this fast. If it'd happened a little slower (I estimated like 20 years), I could have left in time. All good, I'm leaving the second travel is allowed again.</p>

        <p>Does Australia want to say they are just as successful as NZ? </p>
<p>Locking people up for the minuscule amount of deaths makes no sense. I imagine the media has everyone scared and no rational conversation can be had? Very few people even know of someone who had it.  They are just delaying the inevitable. </p>
<p>The US has a culture where if a little bit is good, a lot is better. We get like that with coffee and “superfoods”.  What’s the rationale for going overboard in Australia?</p>

<p>Absolutely not. I'm evil if I even ask questions, apparently. There is NO discussion here - at least in the USA there's discussions and people fighting it and a bunch of people refusing to wear masks. Here, you can't even question your overlords. It's legit fascism/communism/totalitarianism. If you're a political dissident, you're an "enemy of the state."</p>
<p>It's insane. I feel like I'm in communist China or something...</p>
<p>&rt;What’s the rationale for going overboard in Australia?</p>
<p>The rationale, fuck knows. Narcicism? (As in, I think our leader is legitimately a narcicist). I think he thinks he's fighting some heroic war - that's definitely how he talks when he gives his daily press conferences. Like he's leading the charge against the world's deadliest enemy, like it's him and him alone, and he's having to battle all of us (even though we're all "doing the right thing" and obeying the laws). Like he's fighting against us, fighting against the virus, and if we'd just do 100% everything he says and literally never leave the house, he could have his victory and be the greatest leader of our time.</p>
<p>I think that's just textbook narcicism, yeah?</p>

        <p>Judging by the numbers of people affected in Australia this is insane. I'm nearly sure that even people who are generally supportive of the lockdown would start questioning it at this point.</p>
<p>Imagine if all these resources were put into protecting the most vulnerable instead of forcing the other 99,5% to completely alter their lifestyle to protect a small minority.</p>
<p>I might be completely wrong here and you may correct me but I feel like if the Australian government put as much effort and money to support their firefighters and protect their forests, the fires back in January wouldn't have caused as much damage.</p>
<p>With a population of 25 million and only 161 deaths (something that even a weekly death statistic comparison between 2020 and 2019 wouldn't catch) I feel like the deaths from suicide, overdose or domestic abuse due to the lockdown are already exceeding the covid deaths.</p>

<p>HAH! The government spent  $289 billion giving "free" money to people during this lockdown:
https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6173970014001</p>
<p>(For comparison, Australia has 1/20th the GDP of the USA (1.4 trillion vs 20.5 trillion). So keep that in mind when you look at the $289 billion figure. We're a tiny country so $289 billion is FUCKING INSANE. This has caused our biggest budget deficit since World War 2.)</p>
<p>Imagine if they'd spent $289 billion dollars fighting fires. Or $289 billion on infrastructure. Or, and this is a radical idea, imagine if they'd just not stolen $289 billion from people's pockets and lowered taxes instead.</p>

        <p>This behavior is extremely illegal and criminal, and would be recognized as such by everyone if it were anyone but the government doing it. If the rule of law, personal liberty, and democracy is to have any meaning whatsoever then the same standard must be applied against them, which would involve at the very least everyone involved in this criminal conspiracy (including but by no means limited to the politicians, these "medical professionals", and the enforcers) being put behind bars for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>That is what justice demands. A Nuremberg-style tribunal, as suggested by another comment, to try them and impose these punishments would be an excellent start. After the trials are over far harsher laws need to be implemented and in the future strictly enforced against these governments, and against politicians and other officials that even imply the possibility of imposing another lockdown. We have witnessed the horrific results of showing tolerance and mercy toward those who have implemented a police state; after we win this struggle against the latest recrudescence of criminal government, I hope we don't make that mistake again.</p>
