    <p><p>I don't trust my government or big corporations! So if they're all pushing the exact same agenda, I'm definitely not going to trust it. Especially since they're putting WAY too much effort into getting everyone to listen to them. I've never seen everyone being so pushy about something like this before.</p></p>

        <p>But they're not pushing that people start making sure to get proper nutrition, which many people don't do.</p>
<p>Almost everybody completely ignores the nutrients that the immune system requires but that people don't meet their requirements.  Some people parrot 1 to 3 pet favorite nutrients out of the approx two dozen different nutrients that the human immune system requires as if only paying attention to 4% to 12,% of the requirements is somehow smart and responsible.</p>
<p>It seems like all that's really going on is that the goose-steppers issue talking points and all the drones follow along, either pro or con it doesn't really matter, just so long as all that anybody is ever talking or thinking about is what the goose-steppers have dictated that everybody must talk and think about.</p>
