    <strong>My little rant</strong>
    <p><p>Hey everyone. I‚Äôm not a member of this sub nor do I agree with all of the ideas that you guys have, but I‚Äôm able to see your perspective on certain things and how absolutely ridiculous the way we‚Äôve been handling this whole Covid situation is.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt really have any specific points to make, I just had an unpleasant encounter today and it‚Äôs been bothering me and I want to rant about it and I feel like this is one of the only places I can post this without being shit on lol.</p>
<p>So today I walked into my local Panera. As I was walking in the door I put my mask on. (For some clarity: I don‚Äôt self identify as an ‚Äúanti masker‚Äù and I wear a mask whenever I‚Äôm in public to avoid trouble). I literally put it on my face in the doorway and there was no people even around me, yet the manager took the time out of his day to walk up to me and yell at me and said that I ‚Äúneed to put the mask on BEFORE I enter‚Äù.... I LITERALLY put it on my face as I walked in. It just felt so genuinely rude and uncalled for almost as if he WANTED to yell at me.</p>
<p>It just makes no sense to me why this is even an issue especially since he lets people sit at the tables for about 30 minutes without masks while they eat and gave ME trouble for putting it on as I was walking in.</p>
<p>This weird behavior (almost obsession) with masks that people have comes across as genuinely rude to me. The way that people will turn their backs to you or cover their face when you walk by them. I fucking hate it. </p>
<p>I don‚Äôt even necessarily think that we should just not wear masks at all, but they‚Äôre only useful in certain situations, especially now that there‚Äôs so many vaccines available in America. I truly don‚Äôt even know why people make a big deal out of shit like this and act as if masks are the sole reason why the pandemic is still here.</p>
<p>Anyways, thanks for reading my rant if you made it this far haha. I left the store a bad review on google and I feel like a Karen LOL but I‚Äôm gonna forget about it, it‚Äôs just been bothering me.</p></p>

        <p>I mean, don‚Äôt get me wrong, I definitely think there‚Äôs some shady shit going on but as an average citizen we have no way of knowing exactly what the big picture is and I can‚Äôt completely jump on board with it being imaginary since my whole family except me and my brother got Covid in December lol, but I‚Äôm not here to tell you what to believe because again, we have no idea what‚Äôs really going on. Which is honestly hella scary lol... </p>
<p>hopefully once enough people get vaccinated they‚Äôll stop being so neurotic and uptight about everything and want to return to their lives. üò¨üò¨ the future is gonna be interesting either way!</p>

<p>You seem to misunderstand our position. We do know exactly what the big picture is. It is very easy to discern what is happening, especially since so much of it is out in the open. I'm going to focus on one thing, and one thing only, and then just let you think about that.</p>
<p>Our position is not that there is no virus or that the virus isn't real. Our position is that the virus is not deadly, at least not any more deadly than any various strain of flu, we have never been in any grave Danger, and all of this is just a grab for political power. They are hoping they can scare you enough into never relinquishing. All of your family got covid in December and all of your family is perfectly fine. Just like <em>almost</em> every single other person that got it. The numbers are completely made up. Another thing we can verify. This is not a deadly virus and we should not be closed. That is the stance around here.</p>

        <p>Okay, so I'll make it short for you, so you'll understand me correctly. I come from a shitty country where health care is reserved for the wealthy. I have personally witnessed scenes where dying people were refused admission or were treated like shit.and today, we vaccinate people for free? it's funny, because I learned the hard way, a bit like all the inhabitants of this planet, that nothing is free! you can tell me it's a financial sacrifice to fight the virus, but again i only see and hear about covid on tv or radio. I had the flu two months ago, be sure that if I had been tested, they would have concluded to a covid, but I know for a fact that it is not, because it does not exist, everything simply. many people had hypochondriac tendencies before this plandemic, they were just pushed over the edge by the scare-mongering of the end of the world of MSM. Hollywood has been a part of that too, with a trend for epidemic movies the last few years, and I'm not even talking about songbird. I don't want to rush you into your thinking, because I know that we are from two different backgrounds, and that your frame of reference is completely different from mine. but I must tell you that as a citizen of the West, you are the real victims of this takeover, because you were used to living in free countries. we poor third-globalists, we were censored and whipped from our youngest age, we do not really know this intoxication of freedom that you are just about to lose today. and I can assure you it is a great loss!<em>üì∑</em></p>
<p>edit : sorry, i just realise that is not short at all ;)</p>

        <p>I'm sorry that happened to you, but you're right. My husband and I went to a Panera just last weekend. Masks are required when in the restaurant, except if you're sitting at a table. </p>
<p>What really irritated me was that my husband had to tell the staff that a lot of tables needed to be wiped off.  COVID or not, we don't like sitting in someone else's crumbs. This is one reason I have a lot of trouble taking this whole COVID thing seriously. If it's such an issue, then why do we as customers have to ask for a clean table?</p>

        <p>do you see the bigger picture yet? weird how we're tolerant ones huh? </p>
<p>if this virus was a legitimate killer they wouldn't need to shove it down our throats everywhere we go. they wouldn't need to incentivize the vaccines. it's another story if we are walking over bodies everywhere we go but cmon! if this was such a horrible virus don't you think people would be a little bit more cautious about properly decontaminating when disposing of their PPE? </p>
<p>if you can take your mask off when you're sitting but not when you walk around just really ask yourself if you think that would fly if we WERE actually taking this seriously. its all a joke.</p>
<p>a holocaust survivor said the other day that this is more insidious than the Nazis because they atleast knew that the Nazis were after them.</p>
<p>but nahhhh we're just delusional conspiracy theorists and the  government has our best interests in mind right?</p>
