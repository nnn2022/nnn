    <strong>The Parable of the Camel In the Tent</strong>
    <p><p>&rt;<em>One cold night in the desert, a camel asked his master, "Might I put my head inside the tent and share of its warmth?"</em></p>
<p>&rt;<em>"By all means," replied the master, "and welcome!" The camel then stretched his head into the tent.</em></p>
<p>&rt;<em>Some time later, the camel asked, "May I also bring bring my neck and front legs inside from the cold?" Again, the master agreed.</em></p>
<p>&rt;<em>Finally, after more time had passed, the camel asked, "May I not stand wholly within?" With pity, the master agreed and beckoned him into the warm tent.</em></p>
<p>&rt;<em>But once inside, it became clear that the tent was too small for them both. "I think", said the camel, "that there is not enough room for us both. It will be best for you to stand outside, as you are smaller; then there will be enough room for me."</em></p>
<p>&rt;<em>And with that, the man was forced out of his own tent.</em></p>
