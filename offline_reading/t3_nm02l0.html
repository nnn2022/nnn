    <strong>Slightly related re: population control</strong>
    <p><p>My wife did her online women's Bible study again this morning, and there were only six people there this time. Of the six, three of them shared how when they were pregnant, doctors told them their babies had markers for Down's syndrome and essentially suggested aborting the babies. One of them shared how they sat with four genealogists who all agreed on the down syndrome markers and abortion as a solution. Well, before abortion they wanted to stick a needle in there and do a test, which would thereby compromise the womb, which has led to many stillbirths.</p>
<p>It's a small sample size, but that's half the women in a random group. And the doctors scored 0/3, none of the kids have Down's syndrome. </p>
<p>It's already a known fact many abortions happen when the babies don't actually have Down's syndrome, but the parents are told they do, and they are encouraged to kill their own offspring.</p>
<p>Whoever thinks population control isn't real has their head deep in the sand, or up their ass.</p>
<p>There's no doubt in my mind that this scamdemic and the vaccines are another stab at population control, especially if it makes people infertile down the line.</p>
<p>Also, the idea that doctors are these heroes of society sickens me. I have no doubt there are good, decent people who do a great job as doctors. But only humans become doctors and that means doctors can be just as corrupt as politicians.</p></p>

        <p>That is wild, these stories are just horrible. I feel like such a naive dope because I've never even considered that such things go on until the last year. I can't ever go back to who I was before this because I've started seeing so many situations where things are not what they seem. I try not to be frustrated with people who are not connecting the dots here because that was me for my entire life up until recently but it's extremely demoralizing to hear things like this. It's even worse having people laugh at you when you point out things like this as if you're making it up and you're just a paranoid nutcase. I'm going to have to figure out a way to find balance again.</p>

        <p>You're not alone. The blue pill mentality has been apathetically raging on for a long time now. Welcome to the red team. As far as talking to others about what you've learned, you'll have to learn to pick your battles. Jesus said, don't cast you're pearls before swine.</p>
<p>Another thought: let sleeping dogs lie.</p>
<p>Whatever served as your wake-up call might not help someone else. You'll know by the look in their eye if truth is sinking in or bouncing off.</p>

        <p>When my mom was pregnant with me she got an ultrasound.. they told her my heart was malformed and to get an abortion, refused to give her photo prints of the ultrasound (which is common practice), told her I would die shortly after birth.</p>
<p>She never even considered the idea but was devastated, her baby was going to die in just a few short months !...my heart is perfectly normal, always has been.</p>

        <p>Same thing happened with my wife with our first. Doctors said there was a 5% chance of our children being mentally challenged. Urged us to look into alternative solutions. Hinting heavily at abortion. </p>
<p>Don’t go to an OBGYN or anyone at a medical facility. They’re paid liars. </p>
<p>Get a midwife. Do a natural home birth. It’s safer. It’s cheaper. It’s better for your wife’s health and your child’s health.</p>

        <p>We used a midwife both times, first time at the hospital and second time at home. She loved doing it at home. A friend of ours used a doctor and had a fucking miserable labor and delivery. Obviously not always the case, but I totally agree with you.</p>

        <p>I wish I had been able to do a home birth. My husband was way too fearful of it so I gave up trying to convince him.</p>
<p>First hospital birth the doctor literally could have killed me by forcefully pulling the placenta out like he was playing goddamn tug o war as I told him to stop touching me. Thankfully I did not hemorrhage. They didn't even tell me what happened and just put pitocin (to induce contractions) in an IV and said the placenta sometimes just doesn't come out whole.
Uh if you let women expell them naturally they <em>usually</em> do.</p>
<p>Was he really that busy he risked <em>killing</em> me ? Truly what was the end game here !?</p>

        <p>I had 4 in hospitals because I couldn't get my husband on board - though one was nearly a car birth - but my 5th was at home. I gave birth April 2020 and my husband agreed with not going near a hospital at that point in time. Now he's a little more agreeable - if/when we have another, he might be open to another home birth.</p>

        <p>The exact same thing happened to my friend. She was told her baby had a brain tumor and wouldn't survive beyond 6 months if he was born. Her and her husband decided to keep him anyway and as it turns out, he's a healthy 10 year old now. The tests were wrong. </p>
<p>I was also pushed into an abortion (D&amp;C) for my first pregnancy. The doctors said there was something wrong, they couldn't find the pregnancy even though my HCG levels were doubling properly. They told me that it was so early, it didn't matter and I would be able to have another and I would be back in the maternity ward in no time. Two years later and I have not been able to get pregnant since. I'm concerned that the laparoscopy and d&amp;c they did has made me infertile but there's no way to prove it. The best part is, the only specialist for fertility in this area is the same doctor that pressured me to get the d&amp;c. I am very skeptical of these types and if I ever do have the blessed chance to get pregnant again, I will be seeing my local midwife instead.</p>
