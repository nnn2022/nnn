    <strong>New Tears Celebration Programming in the US</strong>
    <p><p>I'm sure a lot of you are at a party right now where the New Years programming is on a TV somewhere in the corner, providing background noise.</p>
<p>Right now, they are montaging all of the "heart warming moments" of folks with their hands pressed against the glass of a nursing home, wishing goodwill to the family member contained with in.</p>
<p>And there is all this tension..."if only we could come inside." "If only we could be together."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, here in reality, we are together. We are all here, watching you tell us how bad it is.</p>
<p>Lady on the commercial literally says...</p>
<p>"I can't wait to hug my mom again."</p>
<p>We are all here watching you tell us how terrible all this is. We were here on Thanksgiving hearing you say how bad it was. We listened to you on Christmas afternoon. We are listening to you now on New Years Eve.</p>
<p>Everyone who was here on Memorial Day is here on New Years.</p>
<p>I try to highlight moments like this to the consituents of Fear Mongering.</p>
<p>I can see through the windows of the houses across from us - loved ones gathered, no masks. House next to them, loved ones gathered, no masks. Walked to the gas station to get a Redbull so I can make it to midnight and beyond...</p>
<p>Lit living rooms with maskless gatherings across the Town althroughout my walk.</p>
<p>But the heads on the TV continue to yammer on.</p>
<p>This shit is so surreal...</p></p>

        <p>Yep I'm at a family members house for our annual dinner/hang out for NYE. We were watching this and saying "these people are ridiculous !" And "well you CAN go hug your mom !" Etc. </p>
<p>It's absolutely pathetic.</p>

        <p>It is really like some sort of bizarre alternate universe, isn't it? When they play commercials of people having zoom parties with #AloneTogether hashtag and save your grandma by letting her rot alone in a care home staring at four walls.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I've been on several trips, never stopped hanging out with my friends including the ones who are healthcare workers, hugged my parents, hugged my grandparents, had friends over for Xmas and NYE etc. </p>
<p>I even had a grocery shop worker tell me how bizarre these commercials are for her considering she comes into contact with hundreds of people every day lmao</p>

        <p>In the television coverage of NYC/Times Square, the vaccine has already been mentioned a number of times. It came up during the interview with Biden and his wife. It's all advertising and programming.</p>
