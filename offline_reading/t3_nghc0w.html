    <strong>My maskless experience today at Target and Starbucks in Brooklyn, NYC</strong>
    <p><p>Today the indoor mask mandate was lifted in NY (there are exceptions like public transportation, etc.). So as long as a business no longer has a mask requirement, today was the first day to go maskless indoors (shopping, etc.)</p>
<p>Anyway, this is only a big deal in the context of the nonsense we are dealing with. I know people in other areas of the country haven't been wearing a mask indoors for a while, but in places like NYC, this was the first day.</p>
<p>I went to Target (South Brooklyn) this afternoon. Walked-in, no mask. Had no issue and not a soul said anything to me.  Didn't notice any looks either. I walked the entire store and passed as many customers and employees as I could. Took me a while to finally see another person maskless (an employee). I found one customer also maskless and a maskless couple entering the store as I left. So four people maskless in the entire store.  Depressing, but expected. Hopefully as more become aware of the new guidelines and see others maskless, they will be more comfortable to do so.</p>
<p>Picked-up a mobile order at Starbucks in Bay Ridge later in the afternoon. Wasn't in there long and was the only maskless person. Again no customer or employee said anything to me.</p>
<p>Overall, not bad I guess. No questions if I was vaccinated or not which was a positive. Employees are definitely aware of the new guidelines, so that is a positive as well. Negative is being one of the only people maskless, but that's fine w/ me.</p>
<p>So my fellow NY'ers, please join me and let's encourage as many people as we can by our actions. Many people want to drop the mask, but need to see others lead the way.  I will do my grocery shopping maskless later in the week. If any store tells me I need to wear a mask, they will lose my business. That is how it will be from now on. I've followed your rules for 15 months. I'm done.</p></p>

        <p>How old are you? I'm 24 and I'm from Albany. I went shopping at the grocery store today and EVERYONE with a mask give me the stink eye because they all assumed because of my age I couldn't POSSIBLY be fully vaccinated even though I am. My mom who is not vaccinated went to target with no mask and she said no one gave her looks. How ageist of people to assume because I am young I am antivax trash</p>
