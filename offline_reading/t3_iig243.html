    <strong>Why this hysteria pisses me off so much.</strong>
    <p><p>A lot of people are understandably angry about the nonsense this pandemic has brought to our lives, but for me, I think it boils down to something even deeper. You see, I've always been kind of an anxious person by nature. I was that kid who bawled when her family forced her on to roller coasters, the kid who completely lost her shit during school fire drills, and just overall worries about anything and everything that could go wrong in any given situation. In response to my freak outs, the message I got from the adults around me was that my fears were "irrational," and that 99% of what I panicked about on a daily basis would likely never come to pass. Prior to COVID, this is what I heard from the rest of the world as well: that we should just sit back, relax, and stop worrying about the things we can't control. </p>
<p>Well, now that this stupid virus has hit, it seems allllll that stuff just went out the window. All those adults that used to talk me down from my fears and set an example of living boldly have totally backtracked. Now the message I'm getting is that even for a virus with an EXTREMELY high survival rate, we need to shut down the world and completely alter our way of life. All those people that lectured me about refusing to give into irrational fears have practically boarded up their houses and refused to put one toe outside without a mask. </p>
<p>It's just frustrating, and quite frankly scary to see how, if COVID's not an irrational fear, then maybe mine weren't either. Maybe I <em>was</em> right to worry about slipping out of my seat at the amusement park. Maybe I <em>was</em> right to worry about drowning at the lake. It honestly helped me to see that the rest of the world was living their lives perfectly fine, if that makes sense. It actually HELPED me to know that <em>I</em> was the "freak," because it gave me some assurance that I didn't need to worry about half the shit I did. But now that my metaphorical emotional rock has come crumbling down, I don't even know what to think anymore. If young, healthy people are getting this upset over COVID, then how they ever expect me to take them seriously when they try to calm me down over MY fears?</p></p>

        <p>Nah, I'm in exactly the same boat as you, OP. Right down to the anxiety and frustration at the abrupt 180 done by society at large.</p>
<p>Hell, you'd think a known hypochondriac with anxiety issues in the best of times saying "yo, this is bullshit" to the whole 'rona farce would give people in my life some pause, but brainwashing from the MSM and their "betters" like Creepy Uncle Joe is way more powerful, I've found.</p>

        <p>What pisses me off is that these people applaud themselves for this shit and make us into the bad guys. I'm a bad guy for literally doing nothing? Trying to live my life as I always have? Not worried about getting sick? That makes me the scum of the Earth? </p>
<p>Once we all look back at the repercussions they'll learn who the real bad guy was and they'll try to retroactively say "i never supported the lockdown, I was against it the whole time, I was right!"</p>

<p>Exactly. I mean, obviously if you're sick you should stay home, but it's ridiculous and unreasonable to assume that all otherwise healthy people have the virus and should alter their lives accordingly.</p>

        <p>Ahh same, last year I had a lot of anxiety over my health because I have an autoimmune condition which required a lot of work to manage. Doctors initially try to scare you into compliance ("if you don't do this and this and this, you will face all these horrible long-term complications!") so I was a very obedient patient. Then they would say, oh, why do you have so much anxiety? Maybe because you all terrified the hell out of me! Anyway, I put a lot of effort into my health and got to a place where I was able to live a fulfilling life with minimal anxiety. Then this pandemic came and everyone went insane.</p>
<p>You're not alone and you're in the right - this virus IS an irrational fear. Don't cower in fear over other things either - what all this hysteria demonstrates to me is that few things in life are worth being afraid of, and what you should fear most of all is living a life without doing things you enjoy.</p>

        <p>OMFG SAME! SAME! i woke up one morning in April and i was like, "honey, my depression is GONE."</p>
<p>i've been diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety since i was 16, so this wasn't my first time at the GAD rodeo. what startled me into cognizance was seeing everyone around me start acting like the irrational person i had been. constantly stressed out, worrying about everything, dwelling on the past, terrified for the future, constantly second guessing myself, attempting to micromanage everything in my life, and excessive, obsessive control. watching other people act like me made me realize i was free.</p>
<p>for the first time in 20 years, i'm free. i am free from my obsessive thoughts, free from the desire to control everything around me, free from the worry, free from the anxiety, free from the dark shadows in my mind that come out when i have a moment of peace. i am free from the choices i made in the past and free to make different choices in the moment. i am free to live in the moment. i am accountable to myself no one else.</p>
<p>i now see that no matter how many good plans are made, or how many strategies are constructed, no matter how much control is exerted, it's truly out of our hands. we have to make the best decisions with the information we have and we have to live with the choices we make. the best, smartest plans can and will fall apart. the smart people don't have all the answers. the world is a broken place and screws fall out all the time. and that's okay. it's okay to make mistakes, it's okay to try to fix them, it's okay to make different mistakes, and it's okay to move on. no matter how hard we try, something, somewhere, somehow will go wrong. it's okay. i'm not in control of any of it - i simply have to be in it. there is something bigger than us in charge - whether it's god or mother nature or the universe, we simply have to accept it.</p>
<p>it's liberating, you see.</p>
<p>i'm at peace with this. i now know that i'm simply energy - energy never goes away, it just assumes different forms.</p>
<p>sometimes i'm water - i can be the wave, the foam, the raindrop, the snow, the mist, the fog, the cloud, the current, the undertow.</p>
<p>sometimes i'm the air - i'm a cool breeze, i'm the warm smoke, i'm the tornado, i'm the howl, i'm the sky, i'm a ray of sunshine.</p>
<p>sometimes i'm the earth - i'm the lava, i'm the soil, i'm the roots, i'm the salt, i'm the bones, i'm the sand,.</p>
<p>and sometimes i'm the fire - i can be the flame, i can be the spark, i can be the ember, i can be the ash.</p>
<p>it's all just different energy and it never goes away, i just have to change with it.</p>
<p>time only goes one way, and i'm going with it.</p>
<p>i see these people losing their minds, riddled with anxiety, mired in depression, looking for answers that no one can give, hoping against hope that someone, somewhere can make it all stop. that someone is definitely in control. that someone will tuck them in at night and check for monsters under the bed, or protect them from the wendigo. they want someone to do the living for them. but no one - no one - has all the answers. </p>
<p>i no longer believe in such things, and it set me free. it's okay to not be in control. it's okay to be worried, but don't let fear and anxiety and stress consume you. plan for what you can, you can deal with the rest as it comes. you're capable of more than you realize, you're stronger than you know.</p>
<p>my depression will never go away - oh no, she'll be back - but this time i'll have better ways to cope with and deal with her. she will always be a little shadow mocking me in my head, but i won't let her win. i won't let her fear control me - i'm going to assume another form of energy and just keep going.</p>
<p>perfect is the enemy of good enough. we go to battle with the army we have, not the army we want. take another form and press on.</p>
<p>may peace be with you, sochabell. find yours - you can.</p>

        <p>Amazing!! The veil is being lifted for so many and we can see why we once felt so miserable - we were being forced to conform to a very sick society. Although some days I still feel so much anger at the current situation and those orchestrating this dark agenda, I know that there is a silver lining in all of this. Many people are awakening and seeing the matrix for what it is. I hope the tide becomes so powerful that it shakes all of humanity from the mind control and we remember who we truly are - energetic eternal beings.</p>

        <p>You are right to be scared about stuff, even covid. The world is scary, but there comes a point when worry no longer serves you. Maybe you're scared of getting in a car crash, so you wear a seat belt and don't text and drive. Past that there's not much you can do, so your worry has served it's purpose of protecting you. If you're scared of roller coasters, that's more of a worry where you have to weigh the benefits of having fun and living life to the fullest vs being overly cautious over a small risk. That's where I feel where we are at with covid. </p>
<p>And sometimes anxiety comes when you're actually sad that the world is so dangerous, so in those instances I think it's best to grieve a little and then be thankful for what you do have. </p>
<p>Either way, don't let worrisome thoughts bother you for longer than they need to serve their purpose. Just let that shit go.</p>

<p>Everyone has been told that there's a four-alarm fire and you should be scared and <em>doing something</em>.  But no matter what you do, the fire just keeps raging.</p>
<p>Eventually, what you're going to see en masse is people giving up and saying, "No matter what I do, we're all going to burn to death.  May as well not do anything and enjoy what little life I have left or do nothing until it's over."</p>
<p>It is going to get ugly.  I can promise that.</p>

        <p>Same here. When I was 12 I was diagnosed with severe anxiety, but growing up I always experienced anxiety severely. It was only when I was 12 that I was diagnosed. Anyways I’m 17 now and I still struggle with anxiety, though not as bad, thanks to medication and some therapy. </p>
<p>The world always forced me to just “not be afraid” and “stop worrying” about what we can’t control, and even people would get mad at me for being so “scared” and “paranoid”. Honestly it made me feel crazy. </p>
<p>Now it boils my blood to see those same people cower in fear and loco themselves away, basically going back on everything they tried to embed into my head growing up. They made me feel like an alien all those years just to now do what they got mad at me for. </p>
<p>Funny enough, the same people who do this, act like the mental health champions because they post “self care” routines on their IG stories and give out the “wearing is caring” award, yet don’t give a single fuck about how detrimental and damaging the lockdown and hysteria is on us. I almost took my life a couple of months ago (not solely because of the lockdown, but it didn’t help at all)</p>
<p>They all loved to say in 2019: “we need to have a serious talk about mental health and depression” yet now if you bring up how you’re depressed or anxious, you’re told you’re “selfish” and “ignorant” for not locking your life away to an unseen end. </p>
<p>Virtue signaling is suffocating.</p>

        <p>I don’t even believe it’s about fear.  I think very few people are actually afraid of the Rona.  This has never been about a virus and it’s not about a virus now.</p>

        <p>I was the kid who cried in order to try to let me on rollercoasters when I was too short to ride so I'm even more pissed, haha.
My risk tolerance is probably too high but at least I've made it few a decades+.</p>

        <p>I was very shy, socially awkward and anxious, and emotionally shuttered as a kid in school.  In college I also battled severe depression and alienated a lot of friends/would-be friends because of it.</p>
<p>I worked really, really, really hard to put all of that behind me.  It's been 7 years of fighting instincts, practicing, feigning confidence, and (at first) powering through situations that made me so uncomfortable I wanted to die.  But I finally got to a point where I feel socially functional.  I can strike up a conversation and bs with a stranger.  I can maintain eye contact while talking.  I'm eager to go to work and socialize with coworkers and friends, in some circles I'm even viewed as the chatterbox of the group.</p>
<p>I truly worry about the possibility of all that progress being undone if this goes on too long.  I've put way too much time and effort into my social skills to let it all unravel due to tyrannical government lockdowns.  Already, a couple times, I've found myself in casual social situations and felt like things weren't going as smoothly as they would have last year.  Could just be flukes, bad days, whatever, but I'm truly worried that the longer we're being told to "socially" distance, the more socially distant I'll become.  It could be what it takes for those old demons to come out again.  </p>
<p>I go back to work (at a university) on Monday, but we're all being told that unless we are with a class, we should shut ourselves in our offices, no face-to-face interactions with anybody, no socialization, all meetings and conferences via zoom.  What a bunch of horse shit.  My hope is that I can find at least a couple other people in the building who are skeptical enough that they're willing to eat lunch together or some shit...and then just hope that some pink-haired freshman Karenette social justice nazi doesn't "turn us in"...</p>

        <p>It upsets me how we are normalizing this hysteria and trying to make it “cute” and “fun” and “less scary.” Ever since my figure skating club started requiring masks at sessions, every post they make about an ice time features a photo of someone in a mask, sometimes even YOUNG KIDS. The post I just saw this morning showed a young girl in a mask and she doesn’t even look very happy. (To protect the kiddos’ privacy I’m not going to screengrab any of the posts that have bothered me, so you can just picture it.) First Communion photos with every child in a mask. You can’t tell me this virus is so dangerous that letting people remove their masks for a Facebook photo will kill all these kids’ grandparents. Look at all the “fashion” masks and everyone who has a sewing machine and an Etsy trying to make money off this. Then there’s all the long rant signs businesses are posting with edgy language and going viral complaining how tiring this is for them, like this isn’t hard on everybody and they’re just special. </p>
<p>For example, my mom went to her vet’s office yesterday to get flea medication for one of the dogs. She wasn’t allowed in the office to pick it up (like our vet’s waiting room is ever jam packed anyway...spoiler alert; it’s not) and had to wait several minutes outside in her car for someone to come out with one medicine. Finally the employee can put and practically threw the bag at her. This same staff recently wrote a long Facebook post about how stressed they are and how rude customers are in these trying times and everyone who responds feels sorry for them. Maybe they should try letting even one or two people at a time inside if the policies are too hard for them to be polite. But no let’s normalize businesses making bitchy posts and applauding people for coming to work. </p>
<p>My point is that I don’t see any of this as “cute.” We don’t need to normalize it. We need NORMAL. The people who have masks and social distancing fetishes can play that out on their own time. (And yes with all the photos of masked kids I’m convinced it’s a sick fetish.) But they’re going to stop forcing that life and their feelings on me. I also can tell you that none of the people profiting off masks or normalizing children wearing them won’t be in the photos we’ve seen of kids in tears because they’re struggling with virtual school, or because they miss their friends. These families have big money and access to expensive recreational sports and school pods. That doesn’t make them bad people but it shows they’re out of touch with what more “average” families are facing. Hell, there are some public school districts here who may not even have enough laptops in time for kids to start classes because of the demand. But no one seems to care about that because “safety.”</p>

        <p>This may be your chiron (wounded healer). With Chiron in Aries a lot of us who were wounded or damaged are coming forward to help others with the same types of wounds we experienced. </p>
<p>You have a unique perspective on fear and anxiety that can help people who have been consumed by it this year.</p>
<p>Glad to have you on this earth. :)</p>
