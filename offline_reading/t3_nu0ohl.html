        <p>I would love to hear what you suggest be put in place to ensure safety while the economy reopens?  Are you suggesting that unvaccinated people be allowed to pass the disease on to whomever they like?  Are you hoping that the sacrifices of those who care enough to be vaccinated will be enough to carry the day and that you can piggyback on their sacrifice.</p>

        <p>I don't know if it's a hard requirement, but it's a lot easier to oppress a minority. If a majority are vaccinated, they'll be more likely to go along with a digital passport. The digital passport can then be used to coerce the remaining population.</p>

        <p>Yeah, but people on the other side will just say "that's right, vaxx or get segregated 💅💅" so this isn't enough. <br>
At a certain point, we need to confront not just vaxx enforcers, but everyone who got vaxxed and supports the vaxx apartheid regime.  Let them know that their complacency leads to suffering and that they are doing the most damage.  The vaxxed need to be uncomfortable as often as possible if we want real change.</p>

        <p>Uncomfortable for what?  For caring about themselves and others by getting vaccinated.  If you don't want to get vaccinated, don't.  That's your right.  Just don't expect the rest of us to welcome you with open arms into our public groups where you put yourselves and others at risk.  Your freedom is important, but that does not absolve you of the responsibility to protect yourself and others.</p>
<p>No one is getting their thrills out of controlling you.  People just want to be done with this virus and this is the easiest way...</p>

        <p>claiming that the "vaccines" reduce transmission, by reducing symptoms... that means Asymptomatic transmission was a lie, so all the mask wearing and lockdowns were based on a lie...If lowering the symptoms lowers the ability to transmit the disease. That means they were full of shit when they were saying asymptomatic people spread the disease.</p>

Unfortunately this sub (and others) is full of people that wear it as a badge of pride how they are the ones "in the know" that have "woken up" that see the "Big Picture" all while being fed their info from the same 4 sources with a clear and present bias.

<p>This goes for the far right conspiracy nuts as well as for the super left 'doomers'</p>
<p>For those in the middle between the extrems...they get shunned by both sides. For most people here, I am a doomer, for the people in opposing subs, I get bunked into the same category as Covidiots, Conspiracy Nuts or whatever.</p>

        <p>I'm not so sure that you were aware. But yes both you and I, pay for it with our tax dollars. No such thing as a free lunch, remember that. Either way, does not matter if I have a problem with tax dollars being stolen for it or if you care or not. They will get the money either way, unfortunate sad truth of the world we live in. My reluctance is not from the tax dollars being stolen for it, my reluctance just comes from it being an experimental vaccine that I do not wish too partake in. Sounds reasonable enough, no? Just having to explain this is unbelievable really, I do not want to take part in this test. It is my choice, that is all.</p>

        <p>Everyone has the right to refuse something after making an informed choice. However none of the vaccines are experimental. They went through the same process other vaccines went through. What you call "experimentation" and "test" is called "phase I,II and III" in vaccine development. What we are now in is called "Phase VI" and is absolutely normal for EVERY vaccine ever created under those guidelines. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_trial</p>

<p>Phase VI trials as per wikipedia: "A Phase IV trial is also known as a postmarketing surveillance trial or drug monitoring trial to assure long-term safety and effectiveness of the drug, vaccine, device or diagnostic test.[1] Phase IV trials involve the safety surveillance (pharmacovigilance) and ongoing technical support of a drug after it receives regulatory approval to be sold.[6]<br>
 Phase IV studies may be required by regulatory authorities or may be <br>
undertaken by the sponsoring company for competitive (finding a new <br>
market for the drug) or other reasons (for example, the drug may not <br>
have been tested for interactions with other drugs, or on certain population groups such as pregnant women, who are unlikely to subject themselves to trials).[2][6]<br>
 The safety surveillance is designed to detect any rare or long-term <br>
adverse effects over a much larger patient population and longer time <br>
period than was possible during the Phase I-III clinical trials.[6]<br>
 Harmful effects discovered by Phase IV trials may result in a drug <br>
being withdrawn from the market or restricted to certain uses; examples <br>
include cerivastatin (brand names Baycol and Lipobay), troglitazone (Rezulin) and rofecoxib (Vioxx)."</p>

        <p>you'd rather have me paraphrasing and possibly changing the meaning just because you think quoting a source is "undermining your argument"? Giving sources is academia 1o1. While I am well aware that wikipedia is not a source acknowledged in academic circles, I am not quoting science here but a process. A process that is explained pretty much the same in any source about "what are phase I, II, III, VI clinical trials". </p>

        <p>I say, the vaccines have gone through most clinical trials except VI, which is happening right now, the post-marketing phase. Which would mean that they have been deemed safe enough to even enter Phase 4. The Vaccines have been 'tested' on thousands of volunteers before even entering phase 4 trials. </p>
<p>Which "Tests" are you referring to? That is not clear to me. otherwise I would have commented on it. </p>
<p>I have the feeling that your post is deliberately ignoring my point.  </p>
<p>You can't state something is untested if it has gone through 3 phases of clinical trials and arrived in the monitoring phase.</p>

        <p>you have the freedom to say whatever you like!</p>
<p>&rt; Which "Tests" are you referring to? That is not clear to me. otherwise I would have commented on it.</p>
<p>You said it earlier yourself - you're not a scientist - not that should inhibit you participating in debate. But you seem to be very happy repeating what you read, and not looking at data.</p>
<p>Which is fine - other people are employed to do so. And report back.</p>
<p>Drug trials will be composed of many different elements. The technical term is ADME, adsorbtion, distribution, metabolism, excretion </p>
<p>To put that into non technical language for you - you administer a drug - with an understanding of what it does, where it goes, how it breaks down, and how it is removed from the body.</p>
<p>With this basic knowledge, you then start examining different variables</p>
<p>medication interaction studies.</p>
<p>bio-distribution studies.</p>
<p>Toxicity studies.</p>
<p>Toxicokinetic studies.</p>
<p>Genotoxicity studies.</p>
<p>Carcinogenicity studies.</p>
<p>Prenatal and Postnatal development studies.</p>
<p>Investigations into the children of parents who've undergone the therapy.</p>
<p>&rt; You can't state something is untested if it has gone through 3 phases of clinical trials and arrived in the monitoring phase.</p>
<p>Science for children - drink a beer it goes to your tummy.</p>
<p>Science for adults - drink a beer it goes to your tummy, a chemical is absorbed into your blood stream, interacts with your brain, you get drunk.</p>
<p>Science for scientists - I don't want to deprive you of learning about the functions of different organs in your body like your liver, at a cellular level you can learn about enzymes, metabolic pathways, chemical reactions. You have starting chemicals that are broken down into smaller chemicals. How do these new smaller chemicals interact with the body? You'll learn about LD50s, organ damage, psychological effects, chemical addictions, dependancies, tolerance. You arrive at ethical questions, political decisions, </p>
<p>Yes your drugs have been tested. No they have not been tested sufficiently to claim they are safe - </p>
<p>how can I be so certain? because the tests have not been done. There is no way to argue the vaccines are safe, - because there is no data</p>
<p>Will they prove to be safe? - possibly. </p>
<p>How will we know? - through study. </p>
<p>We're 6 months into whats likely to be a 10/20 year journey. Don't present "science for children" arguments and expect to be taken seriously.</p>

<p>But I am glad that it only took me three tries to finally get you to admit that the vaccines have indeed been tested....just not enough to your liking. This is fine. Your whole post makes sense to me and explains it in a way I can understand and agree on. Why go through this whole journey when it could have been that easy?</p>

        <p>and we are back at the "This was all Big Pharmas Plan, Covid is a bioweapon, we need Chris Redfield on the scene immediately" bullshit. </p>
<p>You have a hard time accepting what epidemiologists have prognosed for at least a decade now would happen if we are not careful. This pandemic did not come as a surprise to anyone in the field, however it is not because it was fabricated but because it was bound to happen naturally because of fun things like globalisation, climate change and biology. </p>
<p>There is no artificial demand that was created. This might be a viable plot for a movie but reality works differently. It would make no sense for ANYONE to fabricate a crisis like this because you can't control a virus to do your ideological bidding. And judging by Jeff Besoz being the one that profited the most from this pandemic I wonder why everyone keeps going after Fauci or Gates... but well. Conspiracies will conspire.</p>

<li>the vaccine is neither dangerous or experimental, it passed all its clinical trials with flying colors, before you mention one vaccine which did have the blood clot complications, it is not approved for exactly that reason</li>
<li>thats not the reason it was made, its purpose is to determine who can and cant be infectious meaning who needs to wear a mask to prevent the spread.</li>
<li>it was also made to determine international  travel since there are still variants which we do not want to spread since they may be able to mutate and bypass vaccine immunity.</li>

        <p>im currently looking over VAERS data as we speak to corroborate what you are telling me but while i do that lets talk about the 3rd one since you clearly just dont get that the 2nd one is for the safety of the general public.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>so: there isnt a simple answer to number 3. people who have been vaccinated have tested positive for variants but at a much lower rate then unvaccinated individuals. they also tend to have less severe symptoms. However, COVID-19 is a virus, Viruses are very genetically unstable and will basically mutate as much as they can until it finds another stable variant which will spread. if we get enough people vaccinated however; variants will cease to exist for a pretty simple reason. it cant get into enough people meaning it cant keep mutating and finding a way past our immune system defenses. so yeah the variants may be potentially a threat against the Vaccine down the line if they arent handled properly. however if enough people are vaccinated and we are careful to not spread the virus and the variants then its a non issue.</p>

<p>The Covid-19 therapeutic injection (AKA Covid-19 vaccination) doesn't prevent people contracting Covid-19 or Covid variants. This is established fact. Simple logic would dictate people who took the shot could still provide an ample reservoir for mutations to occur and to spread. </p>
<p>Let's assume there are currently mutations out there which the Covid-19 therapeutic injection doesn't protect against. This means both people who took the Covid shot and those who didn't are at equal risk of contracting and spreading those variants.  </p>
<p>Vaccine passports are purely political, have no basis in science, and will create a two-tiered society where it becomes socially and politically acceptable to discriminate. Much like other historical cases of segregation and discrimination. None of these ended well.</p>

        <p>its not a therapeutic injection. that would imply that it is only taken after you are ill to speed up or otherwise assist recovery. the infection rates for people who have taken the vaccine are tiny. you go from a near 100% chance of contracting the virus from being exposed to some amount under 10% depending on which vaccine you get. looking into it further. the larger danger is like going from. .001% of the population had complications and now .003% has had complications. which is technically 3x as much but it is still miniscule you need to keep in mind. much more dangerous =/= dangerous. also it is unknown if there are any variants that can completely bypass the vaccine. we have found variants which can actually cause a sustained infection but even then they still die out well faster then they would normally and produce basically nothing in the ways of symptoms. and finally: do not even TRY to compare segregation to a vaccine passport, its your choice to get vaccinated, its not a choice to be black. you choose not to get vaccinated? those are the consequences, you could potentially spread a dangerous disease and as such you can't expect the same privileges as everyone else. have you ever tried to travel internationally? if you tried to yell about segregation when they asked you for your vaccine history at the airport they wouldve arrested you and stuck you on a no fly list for causing such a ruckus and being complicit in the spread of diseases. those "other cases of segregation and discrimination" are not even comparable to what is going on now.</p>

        <p>It is your choice not to get vaccinated. Sure if the spread of the virus is not slowed and stopped, we will continue to live in the "dystopian govt control world" that you people are crying about so much, but it is your choice to aid your govt in continuing to enact measures to stop the spread through lockdowns etc. </p>
<p>The numbers however show that the vaccines work, the numbers go down and subsequently, lockdowns and other emasures are lifted. But that doesn't sit well with you people because if there are no lockdowns anymore, your whole "we are living in a dictatorship where I am not allowed to leave the house" narrative doesn't work anymore. </p>
<p>There are people who can't get vaccinated because of medical reasons and those people have my sympathy because they are dependend on those that CAN get vaccinated to do that.</p>

<p>To study the transmissibility of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 index cases, eFigure 8 in the Supplement summarizes 27 studies reporting household secondary attack rates from symptomatic index cases and 4 studies from asymptomatic or presymptomatic index cases. Estimated mean household secondary attack rate from symptomatic index cases (<strong>18.0%</strong>; 95% CI, 14.2%-22.1%) was <strong>significantly higher than from asymptomatic or presymptomatic index cases</strong> (<strong>0.7%</strong>; 95% CI, 0%-4.9%; P &lt; .001), although there were few studies in the latter group. These <strong>findings are consistent with other household studies reporting asymptomatic index cases as having limited role in household transmission.</strong></p>

<p>And please can anyone show me numbers that actually show worldwide deaths of Sars CoV 2 divided by age? yes I know that the death rate for people under 60 is between 0.2 an 1% depending on location, underlying health conditions social status, sex, etc.etc. but to say that the thousands and thousands of  people below 60 that died of Covid had "virtually no chance of dying" is disgusting.  Yes the average fatality rate of Covid is 10% (that of the Black Plague btw is estimated to be around 24% and that is btw A LOT!) but that is still 10 times higher than the flu!</p>

<p>for comparative purposes without a standardised testing / recording methodology comparisons are not possible. Cause of death is not always black and white, like say drowning or decapitation. In old age, multi-organ failure as different parts of the body shut down at different speeds. Hence the "death from covid" and "death with covid" controversies.</p>

        <p>Every time I research anything concerning Numbers I realise that all the numbers are junk. Too many variables etc. </p>
<p>It is a sad reality that we need to understand the facts and need to be able to make a fact based argument....with the limited facts we have. </p>
<p>However: That the numbers are incomparable in a lot of cases and that there is a lot of inconsistency by people using these numbers to fuel their arguments, (because they do not know/understand how statistics work, how those numbers are gathered in the first place etc.) shouldn't distract from the fact that we can not have discourse on fabricated lies or gut feelings. Even junk numbers are better than no numbers. even a piece of tissue in front of your face is better than no barrier in front of your face.</p>

        <p>well I hope that everything I debate here is based on some sort of fact. As I stated in another place: I am not against being corrected with facts/studies/convincing arguments. </p>
<p>If I do not have all the information on a subject and my line of argument is thus flawed, it happens. I am not an expert and I would hope to be corrected on it to educate myself better. But there is a difference between "not having all the facts" and "making up facts".</p>

<p>But You are right, I confused the CFR for SARS CoV with the CFR for SARS CoV 2, my mistake. </p>
<p>The Current CFR for the US is 1,79%.  </p>
<p>But if 0.7% is the statistical error margin, a CFR for the flu of 0.1% would mean noone dies from the flu. Right? </p>

<p>I don't know who that is, and I've never claimed no chance of dying for healthy under 60. </p>
<p>stop playing dumb, please, you know how and where to check CFR per age bracket, and you can see that it's not zero (even if it's close). it means that people from 0 to 60 have died as well. so? if there was a 15 yo who died somewhere, does it make the risk significant somehow? there are people dying from herpes, is herpes deadly now?</p>

        <p>i mean... if people die from something wouldn't you call it deadly? </p>
<p>I am just saying the amount of people under 60 who die or last long term negative health effects is high enough to be worried even if most deaths occur over the age of 60. Same for people with health conditions. You wouldn't talk like that if you were over 60 or cared about someone that is over 60. The whole "people die every day" narrative is so damn gross. It's social darwinism of the worst kind. What would you have done? what is your grand plan for a pandemic like SARS CoV 2? It takes you a few months just to find out how it works and who is affected..what do you do during that time? nothing? What do you do once you find out it majorily affects people 60+? Lock them all up somewhere? What would you do if you were in charge. honest question.</p>

<p>absolutely not. that's the exact point </p>

<p>we are in our second year of this shit, we already know what works, what doesn't and what are the risks. hospitals are being closed, medical staff is being laid off. evidently governments are not increasing the capacity of medical system to manage any potential spikes. some countries have already lifted restriction since LAST YEAR and are doing fine, the dumbest of them are still torturing people </p>
<p>&rt; What do you do once you find out it majorily affects people 60+? </p>
<p>educate people and let them manage their own risk, EXACTLY as humanity did during thousands of years. what do you think about it?</p>

        <p>I think "doing things like we did for thousands of years" is not really that much of an argument. </p>
<p>I think that governments should definitely learn from their mistakes for when the next pandemic inevitably roles along (and it will. that's just what nature does) to not repeat the same mistakes. </p>
<p>But I don't think telling the 90 year old demented grandma or the 65 year old diabetic to "inform themselves and than manage their own risks" is how we have done 2000 years ago. </p>
<p>It all sounds very "Let those old fucks die, so we can go back to the way things were" to me and that is really not a good look. I know enough people under 60 that had sever side effects from Covid to be worried. Yes it is anecdotal evidence... Friend of mine took months of recovery to walk up the stairs again without two stops to catch his breath. another friends 2 year old has been affected by it and we don't know yet how severely. </p>
<p>a 0.2% chance of being negatively affected/dying is all fun and dandy until the 0.2% chance is YOU.</p>

        <p>A vaccine is not only "not the only treatment", it is NO treatment at all...because that is not what a vaccine does. A "Treatment" is needed if you are sick and need to be treated. That is were in India for example the use of ivermectin comes in. The vaccine is a PREVENTIVE measure to make sure treatment isn't even needed. </p>

        <p>afaik It only works as "preventative" in higher doses as is authroized, though. Even the manufacturer of ivermectin warns against using it, as there isn't enough data yet to recommend it as a preventative and the success as treatment is, so far, only anecdotal. (I mean... remdesivir or dexamethasone have been shown anecdotally to work as well...still you don't see the same amount of "controversy" around those) </p>
<p>I just go by what I can find about it online. (and not only by two or three specific outlets) and the reports are...inconsistent. So if you want to point me at a source that supports your statements, go ahead and link it.</p>

        <p>Yeah again mate there is gaps in your understanding here, the source you should check is the FLCCC itself. Their studies are far from anecdotal, many trials have been done all of which show amazing success.</p>
<p>Then there's the results worldwide where Ivermectin has been used, the areas where it has been used have done so much better with cases, hospitalisations and deaths. It's even more obvious when an area which uses Ivermectin is bordering a county, province or district that hasn't. The comparison is glaring.</p>
<p>As for safety, Ivermectin has been in use for decades, maybe 60 years. It's safety profile is impeccable, even being awarded a Nobel prize.</p>
<p>The data is there. But we won't be presented with it as long as there are these astronomical profits to be made. You have to spend time looking yourself to find it.</p>

<p>Yes it has been used for decades...as a medication against PARASITES! my goodness. You can't actually use a statement like this in a context were it defacto HASN't been used for decades...because SARS CoV 2 is a 2019 thing...it is not transferable. Yes the data is promising and I am eager to find out why because on the tin taking a treatment against parasites being effective against a vesticular disease does not make a lot of sense. But if it does, I'm curious to know how. Because SARS type viruses will not go away. They have been around for at least two decades now and the probability is high that there will be a SARS CoV 3. so if we can just take some medication as a preventive, I am all for that.</p>
<p>But to be honest, that information isn't difficult to find if you don't outright refuse to look at it.</p>

        <p>Mentioning it has been in use for decades is to highlight the safety profile. Literally billions have been prescribed in this time. A known side effect is a headache which actually occurred less than in control group's. From that we can say a side effect is helping treat headaches. Honestly, this medicine is amazing.</p>
<p>I'm well aware it's used for parasites, but i'm also aware that the FLCCC have carried out many trials all showing "miraculous" results in both prevention and treatment.</p>
<p>I'm also aware that not a single government or health organisation worldwide have dedicated a single penny to researching medicines already in circulation, everything is about this falsely named vaccine. This is gap the FLCCC is filling.</p>
<p>Rather than arguing with me using your current set of knowledge, i'll urge you again to study the FLCCC's findings. It speaks for itself and will answer your questions.</p>

        <p>As I have stated repeatedly, I have looked at the FLCCCs findings and I changed my stance on ivermectin, thusly. Still, I can't accept you stating that it has been used for decades and is shown to be safe if it CAN NOT have been used for decades in treating Covid. That is just a false statement. </p>
<p>can't we just agree that the results are promising and that we will have to see what the studies say about its efficacy in regards to preventing and treating covid instead of arguing that a medicine against parasites has always been great at battling Covid? </p>
<p>I take every result that helps in ending this pandemic be it an effective vaccine as well as medicine to prevent or at least treat it successfully. </p>
<p>I just refuse to engage in an argumentative battle vaccine vs ivermectin. Both can be effective and we need to celebrate that insetad of pitting one against the other.</p>

<p>Stop pushing the injection. Ivermectin renders the injection redundant. We do not have to subject ourselves to the risk of being killed or maimed by this injection if we use Ivermectin.</p>
<p>I'm not arguing with you either. I'm straight up telling you. This injection is not needed by anyone other than the people who want to make money.</p>

        <p>I am not pushing the vaccine as mucha s you are pushing ivermectin ;)</p>
<p>It is however buying into biologically unsound fear mongering to think the vaccine could maim you. I recommend checking out a few experts on the matter but I know you won't but if you would be interested to look at all the facts and not only the ones that feed your bias, I recommend Dr. Hoshino on Instagram, she is a pediatrician that knows a hell of a lot more about it than me or you and is debunking false claims on the regular. </p>
<p>So please. educate yourself on vaccines with the same energy you have educated yourself on ivermectin.</p>

        <p>Resorting to name calling and insults I see. Classy individual you are. Sceeaming "VAERS" at me is not a source proving anything. VAERS is a reporting system anyone can use. I could write them that I grew another arm as a side effect of the vaccine. Because ANYONE can REPORT ANYTHING.  </p>
<p>they state themselves on their website: </p>
<p>"VAERS accepts reports of adverse events and reactions that occur following vaccination. <br>
Healthcare providers, vaccine manufacturers, and the public can submit reports to the system. <br>
While very important in monitoring vaccine safety, VAERS reports alone cannot be used to determine <br>
if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness. The reports may contain information <br>
that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable."</p>

<p>So you don't have anything that you can show me apparently (and yes I am exaggerating, I am well aware of the reported side effects and the most sever, the blood clots caused by AZ and J&amp;J have firstly: stopped the delivery of those vaccines until more data was available out of an abundance of caution and secondly: These "lethal" consequences are only lethal if they are not treated fast enough, which is pretty rare.)</p>

        <p>Classic trajectory. Ego hurt, nothing intelligent to retort, so insults it is. Not suprising. Did this shatter your identity so much that you have to lash out like this? It's okay to admit wrong. We are all human. None of us have all the answers. I know that believing things because they fit the narrative in our brain is tempting. Because simple explanations are easier to understand than accepting that the world is more complicated than that. But life doesn't work that way. Sometimes the answer to "Why does the sun rise and fall" is not "because the earth is flat" but "because earth is a rotating globe" and we have to accept that, because it's the truth. </p>

<p>Proof of vaccination is a new thing with a coronavirus, possibly the most ubiquitous and widespread virus on the planet. Historically, proof of vaccination for travel has been for dangerous diseases that exist in one country, but not in another.</p>

        <p>you are so close. No getting the flu shot once doesn't make you immune to mutations that are able to circumvent the vaccine. Do you know how mutations are born? inside the host. That is why most everyone needs to be vaccinated as soon as possible. To dry the virus out before we have a mutation that ignores the current vaccines. because then it is back to square 0. New vaccines, try again. ad infinitum. Just as with the flu. That btw also kills people (those that are not vaccinated mostly) That is also the erason why haven gotten Covid doesn't make you immune to possible variants like the Brazilian or the Indian variant. because you had the base-variant or possibly the B117 mutation, doesnt necessarily make you immune to those. </p>
<p>But Life can't wait until the whole planet is vaccinated (especially with a significant portion of anti vaxxers in the mix fearmongering people into refusing the vaccine), the economies of the world took a bad hit, people lost jobs, lifes, etc. We need to be able to reopen safely...andf the only way to ensure that is to make sure people who are meeting can not become super spreaders. </p>
<p>Wanting your precious freedoms back and being anti-vax is an incredible contradiction.</p>

<p>yes... every time you make a copy, mistakes can be made, mutations arise.</p>
<p>&rt; That is why most everyone needs to be vaccinated as soon as possible.</p>
<p>hold on tiger. Look before you jump. </p>
<p>IF - the vaccine is harmful, the question of whether it is right to take it becomes more nuanced.</p>
<p>IF - the vaccine is not effective, the question whether it is right to take it becomes more nuanced.</p>
<p>These are the two "scientific concerns"</p>
<p>You also have "social concerns" </p>
<p>&rt; To dry the virus out before we have a mutation that ignores the current vaccines. because then it is back to square 0.</p>
<p>No sir, the vaccines stimulate B cell immunity to one specific antigen. Spike Protein.</p>
<p>and yet, we know, that individuals develop immunity through a number of different epitodes, including, but not exclusively, epitopes for spike protein. This is why - some people - with immunity to the "common cold" - exhibit immunity to SARS-CoV-2. This is why - a natural infection has the potential to ellicit a higher immunity through T-cell mediated pathways.</p>
<p>&rt; &rt; To dry the virus out before we have a mutation that ignores the current vaccines. because then it is back to square 0.</p>
<p>Sure - for example - everybody develops the same antigens, but that doesn't happen, even when presented with identical proteins, everybodies antibodies are different. There is no 1 magic perfect antibody.</p>
<p>&rt; New vaccines, try again. ad infinitum.</p>
<p>are you an immunologist - speaking to me like I'm a child? or do you want to talk to me one professional to another?</p>
<p>&rt; That is also the erason why haven gotten Covid doesn't make you immune to possible variants like the Brazilian or the Indian variant. because you had the base-variant or possibly the B117 mutation, doesnt necessarily make you immune to those.</p>
<p>I think I've mentioned this nonsense - the more I read, I begin to appreciate you are not an immunologist by profession!</p>
<p>&rt; But Life can't wait until the whole planet is vaccinated</p>
<p>correct</p>

<p>no, we just need to open.</p>
<p>&rt; andf the only way to ensure that is to make sure people who are meeting can not become super spreaders.</p>
<p>encourage people to loose weight. There is some interesting reading which doesn't require an understanding of immunology to appreciate the findings. Fat people spread. </p>
<p>&rt; Wanting your precious freedoms back and being anti-vax is an incredible contradiction.</p>
<p>you're a fascist. with zero concern for your fellow man.</p>
<p>If you want to discuss scientific concerns and social concerns which justify not taking the vaccine, we can talk, I'm pretty settled in my decision and justifications for refusing the jab.</p>

        <p>First of: No I am not an immunologist. I am academically trained to at least get useful information out of studies and one of my main occupations during this pandmic has been to fight anxiety with information. so I consumed a lot of videos, podcasts, explanations, texts, studies etc. on pandemic dynamics, the virus, masks, the vaccines and how they work etc. I don't watch news that I do not stumble on myself (the TV is for streaming only) and I try to keep an open mind (hence why I am here in the first place). I am critical of a lot of governmental measures to stop the spread of the virus but I am not someone that is very keen on falling for right-wing bullshit and conspiracy when I can avoid it. I speak my mind if I think someone is in the wrong and that might be a character flaw of mine but the amount of lies and fake news out there is infuriatingly large. People spreading sumb shit makes me angry. </p>
<p>No, the sentecne "new vaccine, try again, ad infinitum" was not directed at you, but a general statement the way I would in a seminar context. </p>
<p>Concering the two sides of this coin: IF the vaccine is harmful which the media has convinced way to many people about e.g. the AZ and J&amp;J vaccines regarding blood clots, I have 100% understanding for people being anxious about it. I just think that "getting a vaccine or not" shouldn't be a gut decision but an informed one. If you are unsure, get as much info as possible, talk to a doctor and make an INFORMED decision. I am not a fan of "I don't take it because it's poison" or "I don't take it because microchips" or "I don't take it because it makes Big Pharma rich". Those just don't count as solid arguments against taking it for me. </p>
<p>The numbers so far show that side effects of all the vaccines on the market are mostly a temporary inconvenience and in very rare cases a lethal danger. Even the blood clouts in the brain, now that it is a known side effect, are perfectly treatable in time without long term effects. </p>
<p>IF the vaccines are not effective, and so far the studies and the numbers show an effectiveness way above the efficacy of e.g. a flu vaccine, getting the vaccine would still make a difference because even a vaccine that is less effective is better than no effect at all. And so far the efficacy even in regards to the better known mutations seems to be significant! </p>
<p>And yes, although it has been some time since my biology classes, I am well aware that the human body is incredibly complicated and that immunity for the one is not the same as for the other. What I do understand though is that a virus that replicates billions and billions of times within my body and wreaking havoc in the process is a much less desirable than some mRNA strands that will have been processed by my body in a matter of days and only left my immunesystem more informed than before. So even if I am vaccinaed, still get infected with the virus, the chances are high that my body has an easier fight, I could even be asymptomatic and my probability of dying is EVEN smaller than it would have been in the first place. </p>
<p>fat people spread...whoa..abelist much? </p>
<p>I would however like you to explain to me what you think "fascist" means. Especially because my concern for my fellow humans on this planet includes the fat people that you blame for spreading the disease, the old people that noone here seems to be concerned with (I haven't seen my grandmother in a year and will finally be able to visit her again after my second shot), everyone that is counting on herd immunity because they can not get the vaccine because of auto immune reasons etc. I trust in the science and that seems to anger people who are more concerned with Bill Gates and Fauci and Big Pharma etc. I think it is incredibly selfish to shout for more freedom, for opening up, for lifting of measures while doing nothing to help create an environment where that is possible. On the contrary. People that refuse to wear masks, to social distance and that spread falsehoods about the vaccine (like that it sterilises you etc (which covid btw can do, as you know)) so that others are too afraid to take it just help to continue the measures that would completely unnecessary in a culture where everyone would look out for one another.</p>

<p>possibly. I advocate "body-mass passports" before vaccine passports. It would be a much more effective system to reduce virus transmission and hospitalisations. And much easier to track hamburgers than it is to track an invisible virus! - but - politics ;)</p>
<p>&rt; I would however like you to explain to me what you think "fascist" means.</p>
<p>One who advocates for suppression of individual freedom in favour of a regimented society controlled by an unaccountable central authority. Its the individual working to protect this authority that distinguishes a fascist from an opinionated democratic citizen.</p>
<p>&rt; I am not an immunologist... I trust in the science</p>
<p>Understanding the scientific method is more important than understanding an individual subject. "The Science" isn't settled - it never is - science is a method, a journey not a destination. The injections under discussion are 6 months into what will likely be a 10/20 year research journey. Pressuring people to take unproven medication with potentially life altering side effects is evil. "The end".</p>
<p>&rt; What I do understand though is that a virus that replicates billions and billions of times within my body and wreaking havoc in the process is a much less desirable than some mRNA strands that will have been processed by my body in a matter of days and only left my immunesystem more informed than before.</p>
<p>Does it? Is it? Most people are unaffected by the virus - correct?</p>
<p>While we wait and work towards a better understanding of whats happening with the virus and the drugs being pushed on us - we prepare ourselves philosophically. The social questions which require reflection and debate, not coercion and public shaming.</p>
<p>How can we ethically encourage vaccination when we can't answer the question of safety and efficiency?</p>
<p>Vaccination benefits a few individuals, medically it benefits those at risk, socially it benefits those who stand to gain from vaccination policy. </p>
<p>Why should one person be coerced to take a risk to reduce someone else's risk? I admire altruism, but it shouldn't be coercive.</p>
<p>We know median age of death "with" (a flawed) positive coronavirus death is 82 years, which is more less the mean life expectancy.</p>
<p>If one 12 year old child dies through an adverse vaccination affect - an average of 70 life years lost.</p>
<p>Should one weigh the relative value of this sacrifice against the life years gained?</p>
<p>Would public health policy deem this an acceptable loss in exchange for the potential 1 additional year of life in "x" individuals aged 81 or older?</p>
<p>&rt; I think it is incredibly selfish to shout for more freedom, for opening up, for lifting of measures while doing nothing to help create an environment where that is possible. On the contrary. </p>
<p>Who is preventing "freedom" and "opening up" ? Who has created an environment where we can't ? Viruses don't employ police or run propaganda campaigns.</p>

        <p>First of: I like that you go down the "how many lifes are lost to covid" road, since there are already studies on that: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-83040-3">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-83040-3</a></p>
<p>Secondly: We are currentyl in Phase VI of the vaccine process. Like it happened to soo any other vaccines in the last decades. It is an approved process that is so incredibly misunderstood that the BS of "worldwide human experimentation" has taken roots although it should never have. EVERY approved vaccine goes to Phase VI and every vaccine were the risks do outweigh the benefits is regulated or taken off the market completely. It has been done before...just then people didn't care as much as they are now. </p>
<p>I would however say that there is a difference between asking people for solidarity and getting rid of radical individualism (because that will be the death of any society, because a society is a GROUP of people) is not the same as facism, vecause that would mean I have a blind trust in the political system that is in charge of the crisis...and most governments worldwide have shown that they are ill equipped to manage such a crisis. Measures are put in place at the wrong time, lifted at the wrong time, some measures don't make ANY sense at all, some useful measures aren't even implemented at all. Everyone is so focused on the economy that they wreck it by focusing on it when the focus need be elsewhere (just imagine a short super hard lockdown for 1 month in the beginning of 2020 (There are several reasons why this wouldn't have worked I know, but just as a thorugh experiment). Do you think the economy would have taken a stronger hit from that then it did through open, close, open close?)  </p>
<p>No Viruses don't employ police. The virus doesn't care. It doesn't care about your freedom, your life or your wallet. It only cares about reproducing and spreading. So the more easy of a host you are, the better for the virus. No preventive measures and boom it's everywhere. And it won't stop until we stop the spread. the only alternative is for it to become endemic. Than we won't need to worry about it anymore... but that will take time...and until then it has to be dealt with somehow. There is no antidote. This is not a movie.</p>

        <p>You literally referred to the lifes lost if a 12 year old dies vs the lifes lost if a 85 year old dies. I was and am referring to that. If you didn't get that maybe it is not me that has a problem with reading comprehension. </p>
<p>And there are already papers that call for exactly those numbers to be taken into accounts and not the number of deaths, but the cumulative number of lifes lost. So If somone dies in their 30s that these they are measured against the life expectancy of that individual. And I'm all for that. No matter if because of covid or vaccine fatalities. So wether you intended to or not, you DID talk about those numbers.</p>
<p>"We are in Phase 4 of clinical trials" is not a meaningless sentence without subject or context, because subject as well as context SHOULD be pretty clear: The approved vaccines against the SARS CoV 2 virus (e.g: the vaccines by BioNtech, AstraZeneca, Moderna etc.) have finished Phase III when they became available for public vaccination. This means they are now post-marketing. Which means that in the process of Clinical trials we are in Phase VI for these trials. This should be common knowledge which is why I don't understand why you are so reluctant to accept that. </p>
<p>The vaccine efficiency is the topic of a huge amount of studies conducted at the moment and to state they are not effective is just wrong when the observed effecticeness is prognosed to be even higher than for an annual flu vaccine (of which the efficacy is aroud 60%) </p>
<p>Same goes for the vaccine safety which does take all side effects into account which are collected and observed in studies as well. And so far the numbers look promising enough as to say that at the very least the vaccines are safer than being infected with SARS CoV 2. If you go on to point out how less than 2% of the population die from getting Covid and the vaccines are even safer than an actual infection, there is no argument to be made that the vaccines are more dangerous than Covid. Way more people die from Covid than they do from the vaccines. </p>
<p>Yes dangerous side effects like blood clouts etc. should be taken into account and measures taken if that number reaches a certain threshold but that is exactly what is supposed to happen in Phase 4 of a clinical trial, it is exactly why caution was observed with the J&amp;J and AZ vaccines.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So no. I refuse to have those arguments put aside because I am not able to express them in a way that would fit your sensibilities. I am neither trolling nor being nonsensical. I tried to have an honest discourse with you. But if you keep ignoring the points I made to focus on your misinterpretation of what I said there might just be no more point in engaging in this discourse. I would deem it a lost cause although I had hope that a rational argument would have been possible here. </p>
<p>Clearly I was wrong and am wasting my time here.</p>

<p>have a little more humility - not everybody here is a conspiracy nut, not everybody here cares about your politics, not everybody here understands the science perfectly - but people are good and deserve your respect regardless.</p>
<p>Your science arguments are weak - instead of copy pasting statements, copy paste and comment on the data the statements are referring to. </p>

        <p>Well, because it's been shown that you can get covid multiple times. An mRNA based immunity lasts longer than one that your body produces naturally.</p>
<p>Also, isn't it just sort of like how pre-covid a full set of vaccines is required to send your kids to school, or join the military, or travel to a lot of other countries. Bruh, last time I went to a different country they needed a clean AIDS, Tuberculosis and Measles test for the visa process. It's a pain, but moving from one country to another is a privilege, not a right.</p>

        <p>&rt; specifically in areas which are using the damn vaccines.</p>
<p>case numbers are dropping rapidly in countries with ~3% vaccination rate.<br>
its mostly seasonality at work, not the vaccines.  </p>
<p>sorry I had to tell you this so bluntly.<br>
https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&amp;time=2020-03-01..latest&amp;pickerSort=asc&amp;pickerMetric=location&amp;Metric=Confirmed+cases&amp;Interval=7-day+rolling+average&amp;Relative+to+Population=true&amp;Align+outbreaks=false&amp;country=POL~CZE~BIH~MDA</p>
<p>here you can view 4 countries that are more or less comparable with each other. case numbers are acting almost the same while 2 of those 4 have very low vaccination rate.<br>
don't close your eyes to facts like these. its not healthy.</p>
<p>its still reasonable (to a degree) to get the old and frail vaccinated for fall and winter. other than that is not necessary.</p>

        <p>It stops being experimental once it passes the safety and efficacy standards that vaccines are typically subject to. These vaccines haven't yet and if you say otherwise you're spreading misinformation and you're getting banned from Twitter. Lol. </p>
<p>Anywho, it stops being experimental once it becomes an "approved" (and still optional) vaccine, that has been tested over a long enough period of time and has the proper amount of documentation on its safety and efficacy over time.  </p>
<p>Get it if you want, but it's still experimental, even in the eyes of daddy government.</p>

        <p>I'd never take any drug or medicine that hadn't been widely used for decades. How often do you see lawsuits regarding drugs that have been FDA approved and been around for years? They often discover a problem with them many years later.</p>

        <p>Ugh the government is paying for everyone’s healthcare with our taxes.  Moron. So those of us who don’t want the vaccine are paying for other people to get theirs.  You’re welcome.</p>

        <p>&rt; Because rates are hugely down, specifically in areas which are using the damn vaccines.</p>
<p>They're also down in areas with low vaccination rates as well.  Are you implying that correlation is causation?  Not particularly scientific.</p>
<p>&rt; but thankfully the govt is paying for everyone's healthcare for once.</p>
<p>You do realize these are $30 a shot,  right?  For the amount of money we will spend on these shots,  we could have ended homelessness in America.  Twice.</p>
