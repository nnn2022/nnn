    <strong>Anybody else pro-vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>First things first- I am NOT for mandatory Covid vaccines. But that doesn’t mean I am anti-vaccines for Covid either. I think these are the answer to our prayers in getting back to normal. I know the government isn’t to be trusted in reopening things, but screw them. As soon as I get the vaccine, I am ditching my masks. And if anybody tries to give me shit over it, I will tell them I am vaccinated. </p>
<p>I am only asking because it seems like the consensus on this sub is they will NOT take the vaccine. I get the hesitation. I get that we can’t always trust the pharmaceutical companies. But I feel like based on the data, this is safe. I hate that it took a vaccine for things to return to normal, but this is where we are now and it’s sadly clear that this is the only way to get back to normal. I have been noticing a little reverse doomerism. People saying they will not take any vaccines and nothing will return to normal in 2021. I like to think that they will. </p>
<p>Again, I hate that it took a vaccine for this to happen, but there is light at the end of the tunnel. And if you knew me, you would know that I think the restrictions and lockdowns are BS. This virus is way overblown. And I agree with  everything that this sub seems to stand for, minus the anti-vaccine stance. Again, I don’t think it should be mandatory, but is anybody else like me?</p></p>

        <p>I am pro-vaccine in the sense that I think all who want it should get it. I don’t believe mandating it or restricting travel/job opportunities/leisure activities etc is okay at all, which is what a lot of us are concerned about. </p>
<p>I am more light at the end of the tunnel than many on here. I see the concern but I also am hopeful that once people receive the vaccine it’ll quell their fears and they’ll be more likely to want to get back to normal ASAP. What’s the point of many getting it if it won’t bring back normalcy? I think many people aren’t scared of the virus, they’ve just fallen into the virtue signaling thing-to them there’d be no reason to take it if it didn’t get them a pat on the back and a return to normal afterwards. For the ones who are scared, the vaccine is confidence in a return to normalcy. I think a lot of people are of the mindset that once the vaccine is widely distributed life should go back to normal, and I think that’s good. Once the majority decides this strongly, such will be. I think there are a few truly terrified people out there, or those who are somehow getting off on the oppression who will want to stave off normal even after the vaccine, and they may seem like the loud crowd online but the real world won’t feel that way. </p>
<p>I think a lot of the reverse doomers on here are just very concerned and worked up, and admittedly I am as well, however I think to say things will never return to normal is a stretch. I hear those who are pro lockdowns and masks now saying that come the vaccine distribution and by summer they’ll be done with all of this and this winter is the last few months they’ll be okay going along with this crap. This all ends when they get fed up enough with this and every day that goes on more and more of them do, every nonsensical business shutdown, every rule that makes no sense is getting more and more to come to their senses. I feel like people will go along with it for the winter but then we’ll see more rise up against it. At least this is coming from my observations here in liberal CO, where I find more and more each day saying this is BS. </p>
<p>I have hope because I have no other choice. There’s no point in telling people things won’t be normal again, or that we’ll never get our lives back. As long as you still have the fire of resistance for this crap in you, hope doesn’t hurt.</p>

        <p>I think the downvotes are coming from a misunderstanding, maybe people think you’re trying to push people into getting the vaccine. Sometimes anything remotely pro vaccine gets downvoted, even if you aren’t doing that. But again I think for most of us we just want our concerns and views to be acknowledged and realized and we don’t want to be pushed or forced into getting it. It seems like now if you even say anything remotely skeptical of the vaccine people jump all over you, and it’s frustrating to feel that it’s not safe and be concerned you’ll be forced to get it with nobody even acknowledging your valid concerns</p>
<p>I am 100% for anyone who thinks it’s necessary and safe to get it, and I think most of these people will expect a return to normalcy upon doing so. My only concern is them doing the “not enough people are vaccinated, so we can’t go back to normal until they are!” thing and buying into that, that could potentially be an issue and my fear is that’ll be used to basically force people into getting it.</p>

        <p>I used to think anti-vaxxers were conspiracy theorists. Then came COVID and this experimental vaccine being approved for the general public to use. I'm not in the anti-vax camp, but I've certainly shifted toward that direction the more I learn.</p>

        <p>"It's OK to be coerced into taking an unnecessary vaccine, if it's the only way to re-obtain the BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS which never should have been stolen in the first place"</p>
<p>Mentally rewind 9 months and ask yourself how that sounds. (Hint: insane)</p>
<p>But more importantly:</p>
<p>&rt; And if anybody tries to give me shit over it, I will tell them I am vaccinated.</p>
<p><strong>And they will tell you the exact same thing they are telling people now about masks</strong>: "You're (continuing to) wear it to protect others, because you don't know if you're transmitting a virus asymptomatically." The ~~high priests~~ medical authorities are already telling people that they don't know if the vaccine will prevent transmission, blah blah, still need to keep wearing the masks, etc.</p>
<p>So if you accept that a vaccine is remotely necessary and safe (based on the claims of these experts), why would you not believe what they are saying about needing to err on the side of caution to protect others post-vaccination?</p>
<p>And if you do decide to shrug off the 2nd half of their advice, why not just tell people you're vaccinated already? Either way (according to their claims) it's unknown whether you are infectious or not.</p>

        <p>I am not pro-rushed vaccines. Only ones that have proven the test of time. Anything that has not been researched more then 10 years I will never take. I have only had two vaccines, measles, and I think it was polio vaccine; other then that, I have not taken any other vaccines.</p>
<p>I used to think the anti-vaccine folks were misinformed, boy was I wrong, and I am willing to admit that now. Since this COVID nonsense, I learned to hard way, research, research and research some more. When you're doing that research, research some more.</p>

        <p>I am pro-vaccine.  I have told people in other venues that getting the vaccine when it becomes available to you is the <em>only</em> thing that is "doing your part" in helping to end this.  Everything else that they have asked us to do over the last nine months, including masks, social distancing, capacity limits, lockdowns, and so on is security theater intended to make people feel better about their situation without actually doing anything.  The average citizen can do <em>nothing</em> to stop or prevent this other than getting their vaccine when it becomes available to them.</p>

        <p>I will totally get the vaccine eventually. I’ve gotten the flu shot several times, I have every other vaccine &amp; I keep up with booster shots. But I trust my gut and my gut says that I should personally wait a bit to get a vaccine even once it’s my turn to get it. I do have a bunch of friends in healthcare who plan to get them here soon and honestly I trust them to be honest with me about any side effects so maybe if I get the all clear from them, I may be more convinced to get it sooner but tbh I’m not that tweaked about getting covid again. I haven’t been sick since January and it kinda sucked when I was sick then and I tested positive for antibodies in August. So it’s either from me being sick in January or totally asymptomatic illness. Either way, I’m not that desperate for a vaccine because I’m not that concerned about covid.</p>
