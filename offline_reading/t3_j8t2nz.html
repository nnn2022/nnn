        <p>I posted this in r/immunology, implying that herd immunity is the best method (I remained very neutral on this) and it still offended so many people there they had to lock my thread, delete ALL of my comments and my link, and they permanently banned me.

        <p>The universities and colleges have been apparently going in a political direction and brainwashing its graduates for many years now.</p>
<p>It's not surprising those so-called scientists being at upset over something that are different from what they were ordered to do.</p>
<p>There was an article about one guy being ostracized by his peers because of his stance against covid lockdowns. He was I think quite a well respected scientist before that.</p>
<p>Mortality and lockdowns: The Tel Aviv university study still has flaws. Like not accounting for behavior of the population, whether one area is more of a hermit than the other.</p>
<p>The most important factor in reducing viral infection among the population is likely related to health and sunlight. Sunlight not only works to help strengthen the health, but outright kill the virus. Outdoor also has a constant flow of air so it does not stay in one place. People being outdoors mean they go out and are being active.</p>
<p>Both of which extreme lockdowns reduce.</p>

        <p>Along those same lines, mental health is destroyed by the lockdowns. Without mental health, one's physical health declines as well.</p>

        <p>There is indeed something radically wrong with the world when science no longer accepts alternative views, especially when a situation is apparently "novel." By definition, a novel situation necessarily would not be decided in such a short period of time. It makes me truly wonder if a few people in very high places are pulling the strings on the discussion and no one wants to run afoul of their higher-ups, who in turn do not want to run afould of their higher-ups, etc.</p>
<p>Here's additional information you might find interesting:</p>
<p>"Any reasonable expert â€“ that is, anyone but Professor Ferguson from Imperial College who would have locked down everybody when we had swine flu â€“ will tell you that lockdown cannot change the final number of infected people. It can only change the rate of infection. And people argue that by changing the rate of infection and 'flattening the curve', we prevented the collapse of hospitals. I have shown you the costs of lockdown, but this was the argument in favour of it. But look at Sweden. No lockdown and no collapse of hospitals. The argument for the lockdown collapses."</p>
