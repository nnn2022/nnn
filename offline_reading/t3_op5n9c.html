    <strong>Reporter can interview covid patients but I couldn’t see my sick husband?</strong>
    <p><p>I just watched a news clip of a CBS reporter who was allowed to interview hospitalized covid patients about if they planned to get the vaccine. Of course he taunted the guy who said no. My husband was hospitalized with covid back in January (before a vaccine was even available so don’t go there trolls). You mean to tell me I couldn’t wear some PPE to go in and be with him, but this guy can go in to interview patients? I can’t even express the anger that I feel right now.</p></p>

        <p>If it were really a safety issue you’re right, the reporter wouldn’t be allowed in either. Instead the reality is the danger or risk isn’t why you can’t come in, it’s because they want everyone to have the impression that it’s super serious and dangerous. They need footage of the hospital to put fear in people at home watching the news so they let the reporter right on in.</p>

        <p>My SO's father died of cancer and liver complications last year. He didn't have covid, and his trip to the hospital was rather sudden. She talked to him on the phone a few times while he was in there but couldn't visit. He never left the building alive, and his kids never got to say goodbye. I never mentioned this to her or her brother, but I internalized a lot of fury at the system that didn't let his family see him one last time. I didn't want to add to everything they had to go through, and by the time the doctor said they might allow a last visit he was a vegetable and they were doing chest compressions to keep him alive. He had quite a few health issues, so it wasn't a shock, but nobody got what they deserved. He deserved a proper send off, his kids deserved the chance to say goodbye, and the hospital deserved the middle finger. I miss the guy, they may not have killed him but they've caused some major regret in my life. We can't let these sick fuckers continue to drive our society into the ground.</p>

        <p>You may want to look at his death certificate just to be sure that his cause of death wasn’t marked as Covid. </p>
<p>My wife has to deal with payouts of accounts and most of the people are older and some pass and she has said that on their death certificates, some have a bunch of underlying conditions listed as their cause of death and then Covid is also listed. </p>
<p>One of my family members is a nurse at a local hospital and she told us last year that the employees were required to test everyone who passed no matter how they passed, for Covid because they “had to get their numbers up”. </p>
<p>The death counter that they have from Covid is mostly bullshit fluff.</p>

        <p>It wasn't listed as covid, his case was too closely monitored for them to get away with something like that, and he had none of the classic symptoms. I've heard that a lot too, it's pretty sketchy behavior. I heard that if they exhibit any symptoms at all just mark it as covid, and that they could assume it was without any symptoms on the basis that tests and autopsies could 'risk exposure'. Insane world we're living in.</p>

        <p>Exactly the point. I think the 'professional' consensus was that the examiner could potentially become infected in a low priority situation. As in, "patients already dead, let's write covid on the death certificate because they exhibited a few symptoms. Pretty sure this is or was on the CDC website as well, encouraging health professionals to just call it covid. Kind of the antithesis of where we are with vaccine damages which requires more proof than anything else under the sun while having sniffles counted as covid a year ago.</p>
