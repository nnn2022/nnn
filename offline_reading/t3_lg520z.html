    <strong>These doomers simply can’t be reasoned with</strong>
    <p><p>For the past year I’ve tried tirelessly to convince people that shutdowns, lockdowns, etc. were overreactions, and without fail it falls on deaf ears. No matter what source I provide to show the fatality rate is near zero for folks under 65, people just stick their heads in the sand and call me selfish and mock me for “muh freedoms.”</p>
<p>Literally no statistic matters to these people. I recently started showing the study from Harvard, Duke, and Johns Hopkins that estimates up to 1.37 million excess deaths over the next 20 years as a direct result of the unnecessary recession and unemployment.</p>
<p>Nothing. They still focus on the grandmas that won’t be around in 5 years anyway. The only thing they can do is be governed by emotion.</p>
<p>So recently I decided to try appealing to their emotion by pointing out that child advocacy groups are sounding the alarm for child abuse. We’ve locked children down with their abusers and child abuse rates have certainly skyrocketed. In the USA about 200,000 children are physically and sexually abused in a normal year. If there has been just a 25% increase over the last year that’s an additional 50,000 children that are being physically and sexually abused as a direct consequence of the shutdowns.</p>
<p>And still nothing. They stick their head in the sand and suggest anything is worth it if it prevents just one covid death.</p>
<p>WHY are these people so insistent on being terrified of this virus??? WHY are they so readily willing to sacrifice even children to signal their virtue???</p>
