<p>People say this and its completely false.  If she's not in a nursing home, her chance of severe covid is almost zero regardless of age.</p>

They use a very small group of young people who are already at minimal risk of getting infected, and flawed PCR tests on the reference group.

        <p>Have you... read this sub?</p>
<p>Here's one of thousands of examples of a doctor stating that mRNA vaxxes may well lead to autoimmune conditions, among other lifelong health conditions. Remember please that these are permanent.</p>
<p>"Tal Brosh, head of the Infectious Disease Unit at Samson Assuta Ashdod Hospital, told The Jerusalem Post.When  Moderna was just finishing its Phase I trial, The Independent wrote  about the vaccine and described it this way: “It uses a sequence of  genetic RNA material produced in a lab that, when injected into your  body, must invade your cells and hijack your cells’ protein-making  machinery called ribosomes to produce the viral components that  subsequently train your immune system to fight the virus.”“In this case, <a href="https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/moderna-says-its-vaccine-is-945-percent-effective-in-preventing-covid-19-649258">Moderna’s</a>  mRNA-1273 is programmed to make your cells produce the coronavirus’  infamous coronavirus spike protein that gives the virus its crown-like  appearance (corona is crown in Latin) for which it is named,” wrote The  Independent.Brosh said that  this does not mean the vaccine changes people’s genetic  code. Rather, he said it is more like a USB device (the mRNA) that is  inserted into a computer (your body). It does not impact the hard drive  of the computer but runs a certain program.</p>
<p>But  he acknowledged that there are unique and unknown risks to messenger  RNA vaccines, including local and systemic inflammatory responses that  could lead to autoimmune conditions.  </p>
<p>An article published by the National Center for Biotechnology  Information, a division of the National Institutes of Health, said other  risks include the bio-distribution and persistence of the induced  immunogen expression; possible development of auto-reactive antibodies;  and toxic effects of any non-native nucleotides and delivery system  components."</p>

<p>Yeah, I suppose there's a few. Thing is it's not just a place to sleep I'd be losing out on. I have my ps4, gaming pc, netflix, hulu, etc. I live, a really good life. Moving to a homeless shelter would.... be an adjustment and there's a pretty good chance I'd get assaulted as I come off as quite weak.</p>

        <p>Oh, I mean right now I love my life, I'm the opposite of suicidal. You said what will you do when your parents die, yeah? Well assuming they leave me with no money or housing then I mean I can either die from homelessness or on my own terms. Getting a job is not an option, I will never work, I despise the concept.</p>

<p>I mean, someone has to work to provide the money for you.   And at some point they will grow old and pass on.  </p>

        <p>&rt; You must have hobbies or do things to occupy your time. Could you not find some way of making money doing those things?</p>
<p>Find me someone who will pay me to smoke weed, jerk off and watch youtube and I'll die a happy man lol, but in all seriousness I'd much rather die than work, I'm just that lazy, my parents are definitely partially to blame the rest is probably a mental illness of some sort.</p>

        <p>Sounds like a lack of vitamins, and you've grown comfortable in your own laziness. This makes you the perfect candidate for the NWO, until the government decides that you no longer needed, or until you get bored and want to change your life. But after the jab, there's no way back, that's the problem. By now at least you have a choice.</p>
<p>You say that you smoke weed, how about growing your own? that's a good hobby for you, plus that you could make enough money from it to afford your own place to live. And you'll have enough for yourself to smoke. Find a bright spot in nearest forest and start your weed plantation there.</p>

        <p>So you are living off your parents labor, with absolutely no interest in providing any sort of value back to society? If your parents force you to unlatch from their nipple, you basically just roll over and die, no survival instinct at all?</p>
<p>And the lack of purpose and accomplishment in your life somehow doesn't fill you with shame and existential dread? Are you in some way mentally disabled? Or are you just that broken and weak of an individual?</p>
<p>Im just trying to wrap my head around how your op can exist without being some sort of hyperbolic pseudo reality.</p>

        <p>I mean, why do 99% of people work hard throughout their lives? So they can retire with some money in their pockets and spend a few decades do solely what they desire.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell i found the cheat code, I live that life, at 26, without having worked one second for it. It's in my estimation that most of the people that insult me for my lifestyle are actually insanely jealous and heck, I really can't blame them. </p>
<p>Tomorrow I'll wake up around noon, play some video games, get high, eat some great food and repeat it the next day. What about you?</p>

        <p>I slept in today because I forgot to set my alarm, so I have woken up at 7:30 next to my wife. Its a little quieter this morning as one of my three kids is sleeping over at his friends house.</p>
<p>I have only a little while to get dressed and make myself presentable to go to work for the company that I own 50% of. Now, doing a great job at delivering cookies and snack crackers is a reward of its own, not to mention making me a fair chunk of dough, but it also helps that it is such a social job and with that I can add a bit of value to other peoples lives, free of charge. </p>
<p>I happen to have made a contact at a local eagle and owl sanctuary that I am going to introduce one of the young ladies on my route to, as she has recently graduated from college with a degree in Ecology and doesn't know where to start looking for a job in that field.</p>
<p>I am going to check up on an older lady that has recently gotten engaged to a man who she has dated and left at least a dozen times in the last year alone. </p>
<p>I am going to probably strike up conversation with a dozen people, make at least half of them feel good about themselves, and store some connections I make in the back of my mind for later. </p>
<p>If I can get done with deliveries soon enough, I can pick up my 12 year old son who is trying to earn some dough and use my work truck to help him deliver some scrap metal to the scrap yard. Not a lot of money in it (especially right now) and its hard work, but he needs about $45 for a RAM upgrade for a used laptop that he recently acquired. If we dont have enough metal to get him that much, I will donate the remainder as a "good job". </p>
<p>By the time I get home, my wife will be throwing the pizza in the oven (its friday. Friday is pizza day) and hopefully it is early enough that the family can finally sit down to watch the last Phineas and Ferb movie together (in the basement TV room my wife and I finished last summer. Its like our own little theater).</p>
<p>The younger two go off to bed, and maybe us parents have some drinks and play a videogame or settlers of catan with the older child before my wife and I retire up to our bedroom where we may both be too tired to make love...or maybe not.</p>
<p>Somewhere in there I have to try to finish a map for the Dungeons and Dragons campaign I am running for my friends. Also, I have to finish preping my second garden box. Still too cold to plant anything, but the tomato plants under the grow light are doing fantastic. Also, I got the replacement front anti-sway-bar interlinks (bought moogs with grease ports) for my CRV. Only the driver side one went bad, but I may as well replace both while I am under there.</p>
<p>Edit: oh, I almost forgot! I have to stop at the bank on my way home to pick up the refinance paperwork for my house. Our loan manager, Amanda, has it ready. Dropping the 30 year mortgage (more like 23 year at this point) down to a 15 year. With interest rates where they are today, she can lock us in at 2.3%, a full 2% lower than our previous mortgage. Our payments stay about the same, but we knock 8 years worth of payments off. Booyah. 
...</p>
<p>And you think I am jealous of YOUR life? Why would I want a cheap flashy facsimile of accomplishment when I am accomplishing so much in real life.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you are wondering, I am 30 years old.</p>

        <p>No offense but if you don't want it you should probably stop being a loser who blames your parents for being a loser. You're 27 years old and have been able to get some sort of job and work experience for 10+ years. Fun fact I was a neet and babied by my parents until I was 19 or 20. Something like that. Now I work 3-4 jobs at a time. Started off working at a McDonald's and learned how to work and do simple tasks and eventually lead to me quiting videogames, tv ,drinking, drugs, weed and other time wasting activities that did nothing for my life. In no specific order. You better get working now because your time is running out and you can't ignore it with useless vices forever friend</p>

        <p>Idk what happened to this generation, but MOST people I know also live with parents. Of course I live in CA where it is much more difficult financially (need to make 3x rent, which is usually around $2k+, not everyone can make $6k a month, and homes are on avg. $400k +). I think this is the only generation where kids are not leaving the home. I've had to come back to my parents a few times when men financially screwed me over, and school was just a huge waste of money for me, but I've always worked. Take your stimulus $ and buy an RV or 5th wheel if you live in an expensive state, if not, there are pleanty of cheap states where you can purchase a cheap a$$ mobile home, go on Facebook Market place, I've seen them for $8k. Also, it's time to get a job.</p>

        <p>You can refuse if you really don’t want it. I doubt they’ll actually kick you out. Say no and explain why.</p>
<p>Also, please get yourself a job. I know it seems stressful and I’m not saying this out of judgement but you can’t really make excuses at this point. Just go apply at a grocery store or something.</p>
<p>I got my first job when I was 15 and moved out when I was 17. I have all kinds of mental health issues and had a really rough childhood. The economy was bad around that time because of the financial crisis and my first few jobs sucked but I just dealt with being poor. I hate to sound like a boomer dad but you really can do this if you want to, and at 26 you need to do it now.</p>
<p>I’m not usually one for “tough love” but in this case I think you need to hear it. Take ownership over your life. Even if you work at a fast food place or gas station it’s a job and you’ve got to start somewhere. There’s no shame in it either, all jobs are essential even if it’s not something you want to make a career out of.</p>
