        <p>So am I correct reading this as follows: Female A gets vaccinated. Her daughter B will have some form of degenerative issue in her ovaries so that grandchild C may never be born?
How on earth am I, a male, going to find a partner that did not take this jab with all this social enforcement, lest I have to face my future daughter and tell her she won't ever have kids?</p>

        <p>It's hard to say how powerful the first shots by themselves will be.  If birth rates change by only 20 percent (at first), some of it can be blamed on people not wanting to having children during a pandemic.  They'll be able to mostly hide it if it's not extreme at first.  But there will be additional boosters so the effects might be cumulative and/or get worse as time passes from the first vaccine.  I mean all this is speculative, I don't know what will happen, but they are not only pushing for one vaccine but also successive vaccines.  Is that only for more money and control or are there additional reasons?  There's also a lot of diff vaccines and the ingredients are probably diff for each one.</p>

        <p>You will have to find your partner in a country where people were too poor and “ignorant” to get that shot. Let’s not lose hope, they won’t get us all. </p>

        <p>Honestly mate there was slim chance of that before the mass sterilisation "vaccine". </p>
<p>Find me a woman who has a personality beyond "Instagram, Netflix, dog mom, eating, gossiping, muh career" along with blue hair, daddy issues and shit loads of tattoos and I will eat my hat. Maybe you live in small town America where this hasn't quite infiltrated yet but I haven't bothered with dating since 2017. It was like trying to get blood from a stone.</p>

        <p>First of all, scientific consensus ranks very low on the hierarchy of sound evidence. At one time, scientific consensus claimed the earth was flat.
Second, not all scientists are saying the same thing. I see you stalked other posts of mine and you do here what you did there; neglect any expression of nuance and then provide weird and baseless claims leading into passive aggressive straw man arguments.
I explicitly asked if I understood this screenshot correctly in stating X, not that it were some obscure pinnacle of truth.</p>
<p>You should lay off the propaganda koolaid and stop dealing in absolutes. The world is multivariate.</p>

<p>Thirdly, people still believe that the earth is flat, that the government is out to get them and that Bill Gates wants to cull the planet (after reducing the birth mortality rates) so excuse me if I believe science before wackos. I might be wrong to do so, but unlike most people here, I actually studied statistics and based on my data set of "government hasn't tried to kill me yet" I will go with the vaccine.</p>
<p>Lastly, if this sub was actually a balanced sub where people would write concerns and others will go over them with patience and logic, my reaction would be different. But this sub is just the light version of r/conservatism and the virus is just a political tool. Not sure why you don't see it. People posting here have literal MAGA hats on.</p>

        <p>No, please don't get me wrong. You can freely express your views, that is a given. And I think that is the beauty of this sub.
Also I do commend you for engaging with a sub that as a whole tends not to share your opinion, if I may deduce that.</p>
<p>People are not dying left and right, thank god they aren't. But the matter of fact is, that people are indeed dying. Some are dying because of Covid. And those people seem, according to the literature, share a specific subset of commonalities like lifestyles, age, weight, nutrients, underlying health conditions.
Then there is people dying due to the experimental gene therapies. Those people also seem to share some commonalities, but those seem to be much broader defined.</p>
<p>I can't speak for others, as I don't know them, have no reference what specific comments you are referring to, neither am I willing to justify what others think, do or believe.</p>
<p>You are correct, my concern was if that screenshot turned out to be true, what would be the best way to proceed in family planning. Forgive me, but again I don't quite follow what you are trying to express.</p>
<p>There's nothing I need to forgive you for, as freedom of thought and speech is a belief I value.
Besides, we seem to be on the same page, I too, tend to inform my decisions on the basis of science.</p>
<p>I am glad that you are/were a student of statistics, there's not enough people who grasp its intricacies and I think you can help educate and change the world for the better.
As a fellow academic (I too did study statistics during my postgraduate Neuroscience years, although I admit I wasn't the best) you will probably agree that academic rank by itself strikes as a non sequitur in the pursuit of truth.</p>
<p>There is value in anecdotal evidence, don't get me wrong, but the data set of 'the government hasn't tried to kill you yet' seems a rather small sample size to infer a hypothesis or even theory.
And here's why I am very confused by your comment on my post, I do not claim that the government is out to get me.
And if I were, I would mention the plethora of instances were governments worldwide experimented on their citizenry; you surely know the ones during war times, like the ones Germany conducted during WW2, or the Japanese did during the Sino-Japanese wars. Or even some lesser known ones that were conducted during peace times, like the Tuskegee Syphilis experiments.</p>
<p>In relation to your last paragraph - I am not American, thus neither 'MAGA' nor do I care to justify what other people post.
But you have me intrigued, what does one's political view have to do with being cautious about taking an experimental gene therapy?</p>
<p>I mean you no ill will. I would even go as far as to say I agree with you in our common perception that the quality of discussion throughout society may have degraded over the years. It seems people would rather win an argument than to exchange information in the pursuit of learning. That being said, I think this sub tends to skew on one side of the argument is, that a lot of contributors simply get banned on other subs.</p>
<p>What kind of information or topics are you looking for? Maybe I could help you out.</p>

        <p>First is the general hysteria and echoing of how bad the vaccine is.</p>
<p>I do not think any vaccine is 100% safe, but, again, statistically speaking, it is better than flooding our hospitals with millions of people all at once.</p>
<p>I agree that there is an mRNA discussion to be had here, but there are other options than taking either pfizer or moderna.</p>
<p>My problem with having this discussion, is the sources and the echoing of "bad faith". I do not think you should start any argument from a bad faith position.</p>
<p>And here come politics into play. The right vs the left. No regulation vs more regulation. The "bad faith" argument is one I have heard many many times before, coming from people that believe that the government should let them be (while, at the same time, glancing over all the complex socio political history of them ending up with the option of saying such a thing in the first place). To simplify, there is a privilege in demanding the government to fuck off. A privilege that most people can not afford.</p>
<p>We can go even deeper, with people both saying the government should fuck off while they themselves being on social programmes sponsored by the government they hate so much.</p>
<p>Just as an example, In the USA, in the right leaning states, they had to rename Obamacare to medicare for all, just because those people hated Obama and would rather not have any health insurance. </p>
<p>With that in mind, when seeing so much echoing, so much anecdotal evidence of "vaccines are bad", the spread of "bad faith", and the political plays at hand (the right in general believe in self sufficiency and are usually less vaccinated) it kinda pollutes the entire conversation. </p>
<p>You (if you are who you say you are) can come here and pose valid concerns about mRNA vaccines, and someone reading it might take it and use those concerns against all vaccines and then echo it around. Do you want to be the reason why the next measles outbreak happens? </p>
<p>We can not have an honest conversation about this because everyone is so galvanized. I do not agree with every decision my government made, but from that to "we need a new world order" is a jump worthy of the best Olympic athlete.</p>

        <p>Alright, thank you for elaborating. Now I can see where you're coming from in regards to the political argument.
If I understand correctly, it is your perception that people of a certain political leaning tend to adopt a reactionary stance on all things health.
If that is your concern, maybe you could find answers to your questions if you engaged with a political subreddit or one that is generally anti-vaxx, as I couldn't contribute to such a discussion in a meaningful way.
I do understand that this might be a proposition which isn't too easy to realize in today's heated political climate, but I do find that people tend to treat one differently if one comes off as sincere; You might want to begin with something akin to 'I know this might be controversial, but I am looking for someone who'd like to engage with me although I might not share your values or systems of belief. I'd like to understand where you're coming from in terms of X and will stay respectful, thank you'.</p>
<p>You don't strike me as someone engaging in bad faith since you're still here having a civil discussion with me, I hope this holds true vice-versa.
So, with that argument out of the way I'd like to address your point about the measles;
I wouldn't want another outbreak, that is true. And that's why I would indeed advise everybody asking for my personal opinion to have their kids vaccinated against it.
Those vaccines have been researched for a long time and their benefits do outweigh the risks, according to the literature.</p>
<p>Which brings me to SARS nCov-2:</p>
<p>I do not think hospitals need to be overwhelmed. You probably also have read about how most people who are 'cases' as opposed to 'ill' might not even know they have Covid. Hence the need for testing and monitoring.
While I do think Covid19 can be extremely dangerous to certain individuals (I do know people who had all sorts of underlying health issues, who unfortunately have passed due to it), I do not think on a societal level the danger reaches levels that would justify alarmism.</p>
<p>I would even say there's an argument to be made that overwhelmed hospitals may be due to political unwillingness to adequately invest in health care.
Let me use the US as an example.</p>
<p>https://time.com/5107984/hospitals-handling-burden-flu-patients/
provides an account that shows, that even an influenza suffices to fill the hospitals to the brink due to a lack of capacity and personnel.</p>
<p>One might ask, what's the normal level of occupancy, then?</p>
<p>www.statista.com/statistics/185904/hospital-occupancy-rate-in-the-us-since-2001/
shows that it is round about 70%.</p>
<p>Combine that with
www.statista.com/statistics/185860/number-of-all-hospital-beds-in-the-us-since-2001/
(Never mind the link name, it actually shows data from 1975 onwards)</p>
<p>and you can see a general trend of declining hospital beds.</p>
<p>Btw: do not f5 those pages, as statista will ask you to sign up for premium, if you do.</p>
<p>Now have a look at current occupancy rates: (apologies, as this data shows just South Carolina, but I couldn't find another good overview quickly; the sample size of SC's population should still be statistically relevant)
https://scdhec.gov/covid19/hospital-bed-capacity-covid-19</p>
<p>You will find that the occupancy is about the level we'd expect from the other data points.</p>
<p>Now to the jabs:</p>
<p>https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1682852/000119312518323562/d577473ds1.htm</p>
<p>this is the registration of one pharmaceutical company that produces the jabs.</p>
<p>If you ctrl+f you will find the following quote:</p>
<p>"Currently, mRNA is considered a gene therapy product by the FDA"</p>
<p>Thus, we have established that we're talking about a gene therapy.</p>
<p>Now, if you'll have a look at</p>
<p>https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04848584</p>
<p>you'll find that the trial phase is currently in it's experimental phase until July 30, 2023 -
which leaves us with 'experimental gene therapy'.</p>
<p>I won't police your speech, I don't believe in that, I just want to help you understand that I am not trying to use derogatory terminology to discredit vaccines in general.</p>
<p>Speaking to the safety, it is not my point to claim these gene therapies were outlandishly dangerous, as we only have indications, but not definitive proof for that as of now. (I will admit, that this is precisely my gut feeling, though.)
It is, however, my point to assert that it is impossible to call them safe, since that has not been satisfyingly established.</p>
<p>If you access</p>
<p>https://cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/pfizer/reactogenicity.html</p>
<p>you will find the latest info that the CDC makes available to the public.
If you know click the link 'FDA briefing document' in the paragraph about Serious Adverse Events, you will be redirected to</p>
<p>www.fda.gov/media/144245/download</p>
<p>This document is old, I know. But it is the most recent the CDC deems noteworthy.
On page 10, you will find the FDA deems necessary a follow-up study to phase3 of the clinical trials and on page 12 you will find that phase 1, 2 and 3 haven't even concluded yet, but rather are being run in parallel, which is highly unsual.</p>
<p>Referring to above link
https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1682852/000119312518323562/d577473ds1.htm</p>
<p>you will also find the following statement via ctrl+f</p>
<p>"No mRNA drug has been approved in this new potential category of medicines, and may never be approved as a result of efforts by others or us. mRNA drug development has substantial clinical development and regulatory risks due to the novel and unprecedented nature of this new category of medicines."</p>
<p>You will notice how I mish-mashed Pfizer &amp; Moderna, the US &amp; SC.
Since you studied statistics as stated in the other thread where you responded to me, you'll immediately recognize that one shouldn't do that if possible.</p>
<p>But I am on my phone, and not trying to get published in a journal. I'd be happy to look at sources that would maybe contradict me, that is what a good discussion is about.</p>
<p>I think I have shown now that hospitalizations are not causally but at best correlated to the pandemic and that it's not possible to claim safety with the jabs.</p>
<p>But that still does not mean it's unwise to take them; if they are effective and prevent unnecessary deaths, it still could be a net benefit to take them.</p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33652582</p>
<p>Informs us, that the absolute risk reduction (read: how much less likely is it to catch Covid after taking the shots as compared to before) levels of Pfizer and Moderna lie between 0.7% and 1.1%</p>
<p>So approximately one in every hundred people who receive the jabs will enjoy the benefit of taking them according to the manufacturers themselves.</p>
<p>Now there was a study that I won't cite here, because it has since been retracted, that showed how many deaths the jabs prevented as compared to how many they caused.
The study had a flaw: it relied on the Dutch equivalent of the VAERS database and drew causal conclusions.
But since these systems are designed for primary health care providers to give them information when they, in their professional opinion, think the adverse events are causally linked to the medical procedure, it is not possible to conclusively establish that link.
Which, in my opinion, is preposterous because there is no alternative to monitor adverse events by design.</p>
<p>What I want to say is, that even the gathering of valid data is very hard and does not inspire confidence towards the jabs in me.</p>
<p>As you see, I can understand that having a civilized conversation with the general public may be hard, but we can for sure. I think that's what this sub is for and excels at.</p>

        <p>It would be too hard to reliably spread a deadly virus outside of large cities, because dead people can't spread it around.  People would also happily self-isolate if they actually saw others dying around them, stopping the spread.  We'd probably have a lot of shootings as people panic.  That's what would happen if we saw a real pandemic and it would probably end in just a few months, with a much higher body count than covid could dream of.</p>
<p>Not that I'm completely convinced it's a depopulation effort and not a total screw-up by rolling the dice it'd work "good enough", but that's some reasons why a deadly virus couldn't reach 70% of the population :)</p>

        <p>TBH the first few weeks of COVID I was wearing my mask and glasses and dropping my clothes at the door.  When I didn't see new reports of massive bodies being disposed of in NYC and LA I went 'this is bullshit' and dropped both.  That said if there was a virus that was as deadly and virulent as COVID was supposed to be you'd have seen mass religious hysteria, complete social breakdown, basically the worst parts of the bible.  </p>
<p>What would really happen during a pandemic is that doctors and nurses would flee hospitals, cops would leave their jobs, and we'd devolve into anarchy pretty quickly.  </p>
<p>Oh those soldiers with guns?  Ya they have families and loved ones.  Only the hard core would stay true and follow orders but that's about 15% of them so they're nothing to really worry about.  </p>
<p>At the end of the day the COVID hysteria is bullshit.</p>

        <p>Cause they're too smart for that. They wouldn't have been able to make as much money.</p>
<p>Covid killed the fat, the old, the weak. Perfect.</p>
<p>Now covid is allowing them to depopulate in a more, let's say, "moral, humane way".</p>
<p>In their books it is justifiable due to overpopulation. It also allows them to start moving towards one world order, one world government with vaccine passports, and authoritarianism.</p>
<p>It's really not that hard to see. They make moves every decade and a move was due since 9/11.</p>
<p>This is their move. Billionaires run the world bud. It's no conspiracy.</p>

        <p>So, if Im a skeptic, what benefit would I have to risk it if theres an off chance that this person is genuine?  I do not see an up side unless fear is your motivation.</p>
<p>However, the more I see it, the more selfish I see those taking the vaccine.  We are good at trading our progenies future for a warm feeling now: safety, security, not having go through hard times, freedom.</p>

        <p>A few weeks ago I was having a couple beers with a close friend I hadn’t seen in a while.</p>
<p>He brought up BPA’s and I mentioned xenoestrogens and we started going back in forth about shrinking birth rates and lower testosterone levels of recent generations. Then he asked me what I thought about the vaccine and I <em>lightly</em> unloaded on him about how I thought it was potentially a sterilization program. I’m still not certain it is or isn’t. I brought up Utopia and recommended it.</p>
<p>He wasn’t shocked or anything and seemed to accept it was possible but he mentioned how him and his fiancée had both gotten vaccinated at her request, while she was pregnant. I didn’t continue after that point and changed the subject.</p>
<p>Literally the next day I get a phone call from his mother letting me know his fiancée had to be taken to the hospital where she had a stillbirth at 23 weeks. Placental failure that caused a reverse in the flow of blood which occurred in a the span of just a few minutes. </p>
<p>I really hope this is all bullshit and my friends experience is just a coincidence, but I don’t believe that’s true. I’m just very glad that when my wife asked me if she should get vaccinated I said No.</p>

        <p>So this is pure conjecture but... 
The insane amount of work and funds going into "treating" aging is not especially shocking. Warren Buffet would give up every dollar to trade places with me based on my age so its not shocking to find out he would trade 90% of his wealth to live another 10 years. What is surprising are the advancements. There are many people who believe it's possible to live until the "singularity". Meaning, if you can survive until long enough the medicine by then will be able to extend your life another 10 years at which time medicine will have improved enough to extend your life another 10 years, and so on...</p>
<p>There are many people that think the current generation of people will have an avg life span of 120 and with a good quality of life. </p>
<p>Anyways my point is, if you're hyper rich and expect to live until you're 120 all of a sudden how the world will look in 2070 becomes something you need to concern yourself with</p>

        <p>This needs to be stuck at the top of this subreddit for everyone to see. Months ago, I explained to my brother and his wife that no one knows the long term effects because there is zero long term data, and one of those effects may possibly be infertility issues. They looked at me and laughed and told me I was crazy to think that…</p>

        <p>4chan convinced people like you to microwave your iphones or drill holes in the side to find the hidden headphone port. The memes they produce have grown to dominate culture in a way that caught the elites completely off guard and the ADL went into full panic mode and labelled pepe the frog equivalent to the swastika and literally just flails around shouting "oh vey, shut it down" all day long because its one of the few free spaces not controlled by corporations. Which allows intelligent and mindful people to share ideas and generate new culture and introduce young people to culturally subversive ideas - 4chan made me go out and read all sorts of books I wouldn't have known about. As a kid I was a diet of mainly left wing and corporate slop and then I got older and was introduced to the truth and it was like a light bulb had gone on. </p>
<p>In the same way the black ghettos in inner cities produced great musical talent in the 80's and 90's. It was a space that was off the radar of corporations and young men created a whole musical and cultural phenomenon. </p>
<p>YouTube in its first decade likewise was a place mostly off the radar of corporations and it created a whole new class of entertainment far better than the corporate drivel on TV. I'd much rather watch a mechanic do diagnostics to work out a weird electrical problem on a car or watch a guy build a 74ft sailboat in his front yard or motherboard microsoldering repairs than watch whatever slop is on TV.</p>

        <p>Because the Elites do not want a bigger population. Imagine no traffic, parking everywhere, no paparazzi, Open beaches, preserved world health. They see us as consumer swine that only produce pollution and drama. They have all the money in the world and factories that can be fully automated. That’s what i would do if i was a centibillionaire or Trillionaire family like the SAE, China, Russian, Royal, Musk and Bezos personalities. We have to many bottom feeders and just dirt poor people and nations to create the utopia.</p>

<p>They really don't care about "those who listen"- they fully intend to run the world in such a a way that you won't really have a choice. They know that a lot of poor folks will get the jab for the handouts, and then with AI coming in those poor people won't have more poor kids to be jobless.</p>

        <p>Am against the covid vaccine but I too find this theory of depopulation by the elites hard to believe.</p>
<p>But so many things don't add up tho in this 'pandemic' and the push for the vaccines. And looking at all the explanations, aim of depopulation seems a bit likely. Money too maybe. </p>
<p>Am not sure of anything except that there's definitely an agenda behind all this. Just don't know what it is.</p>

        <p>What if I told you that there are genetic variants between races, and the vaccine targets certain genotypes? I mean...the have tons of DNA databases thanks to all the morons who did 23andMe kits. Perfect way to make a targeted biological weapon.</p>

        <p>But the virus is not that bad. Yes it's a super spreader but the symptoms are not that bad for most people. And most covid deaths are of really old people who have two or more illnesses. I personally seen this in my own town, people battling diseases for months but when they die its covid. The numbers are not accurate.</p>
<p>Origin of the virus was from Wuhan lab which was funded by NHS. The leak might be unintentional or not. But the theory that it was intentional is possible- so that people would have to take the vaccines? Who knows...</p>
<p>Vaccines are not that bad? Come on. Heart problems, blood clotting and death are pretty bad. Especially when many of them are healthy young people. For those 50-60 above okay I can understand the reasoning to take the risk and take the vaccine. 
But doesn't make sense for young people, it seems to me that they're more at risk from the Vaccine than covid. </p>
<p>And even if u get the vaccine you still can get covid. And you still need to wear a mask. Most people got it just to get their freedoms back but it turns out now that they won't.</p>
<p>The lockdowns, masks, closing schools, businesses, loss of livelihood, depression, all this for a virus that has a 99.9% survival rate? Smh</p>
<p>P. S- they should at least screen for antibodies before giving the Vax. I bet that'd reduce a lot of the adverse reactions. This vaccine is not a one size fits all.</p>

        <p>No. From the evil standpoint of globalists and communists - this is genius. Meanwhile, China has implemented a 3 child policy and every Communist country, such as Russia, China and it's satellites (Yes, Russia is a country run by communists, Putin is not a devout Orthodox Christian as many like to believe - read Anatoliy Golitsyn's book "The Perestroika Deception"). Funny how the CCP is saying that their troops need to <em>prepare for war</em> if the Wuhan lab is ever investigated by the US.</p>

        <p>I suspect it's just logistics, they can get most of the population by targeting the obedient ones, prisoners, and everyone who has good jobs that feel pressured to keep them and everyone that wants to travel.  But if they really want to get everyone, they can also put stuff in the food and water.  Or maybe they want to leave some of the smarter ones behind to reproduce, maybe their algorithms show that is better in the long run, who knows.  Independent thinkers may be better for innovation and new inventions for instance.  Maybe with robots and AI, they have less need for brainless sheep busy workers, maybe those are the the worthless eaters of the future because robots can easily do their jobs.  There could be a lot of explanations.</p>
