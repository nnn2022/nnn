        <p>2 things about the free-thinkers (this is not about covid, specifically, just the statement as presented):<br>
1) low risk doesn't mean immune. i might be at low risk of catching the plague, too, but i'd do what i could to avoid it.<br>
2) this is an incredibly self-centered, selfish attitude - just because you're low risk, doesn't mean you can't catch something, be asymptomatic, and then pass it on to someone who is at risk.<br>
free-thinking, as presented, seems to mean free to screw over everyone else by not collectively fighting for a common good.</p>

        <p>If the vaccines are safe and effective, then the vaccinated people are safe from the mean selfish people who exercise their own bodily autonomy and opt out of being vaccinated.  </p>
<p>Incidentally, why wasn't this a talking point before? Can't remember the government and media going full blast on people for not getting the flu shot annually. Or whining about the "collective good" in regards to every other fucking vaccination out there.  </p>
<p>How about this: you go fuck yourself, and when you're done doing that, go ahead and fuck yourself again, just to be sure. Meanwhile, leave everyone else to make their own decisions, whether they're for or against.</p>

        <p>But people did talk about the collective good of vaccines before, I remember regularly seeing stories about it when some kid got a disease that was easily preventable with a vaccine like measles, mumps, etc. because the parent didn't want to get their child vaccinated.</p>
<p>Also, the reason there's a big push for the vaccine is to get out of the new normal you guys are so scared of.</p>

        <p>Horse shit. The mainstream media absolutely was not blasting people's eardrums out with vaccine fearmongering prior to this. It is a constant fucking deluge now, from the government and the media at large.  </p>
<p>We have the government and corporations offering bizarre incentives to people for getting the vaccines. Free food, coupons, movie tickets, etc. That NEVER fucking happened before, and you fucking know it.  </p>
<p>When did they EVER set up fucking vaccine drive-throughs before? This shit is unprecedented.  </p>
<p>No other vaccine has been as rushed as this one. Every other vaccine has gone through drastically more rigorous and lengthy trials, some to the tune of fucking decades.</p>

        <p>The vaccine drive-thru is a new one to be sure, but back when the polio vaccine was new they used celebrities of the day to try and convince the hesitant populus to get it to eradicate polio. People don't really worship celebrity as much these days so that was a no-go.</p>
<p>Also, we had a worldwide focus on this because it crippled the world economy due to a new quickly spreading unknown virus, not necessary in hindsight, so that is why it got done and approved so quickly.</p>

        <p>Fucking reaching to the moon with these excuses. The economy was only crippled in the first place because the governments overreacted to virus that isn't even lethal to nearly 100% of the active workforce. And that is being generous by giving them the benefit of the doubt that their actions were mere incompetence and negligence.</p>
<p>The sensible reaction, being that it has been known since the beginning that this virus is only a problem to the 70+ age range (with an average of 4 serious comorbidities on average - as per the CDC itself), any "lockdown" measures should have been targeted specifically toward that demographic, period. Shutting <em>everything</em> down (well, except for major big box stores and fast food chains, lol, really now) was plainly idiotic. And let's not forget that several places fucked up even worse by deliberately mingling people who had the virus with elderly people by opting to place them in elder care facilities rather than actual hospitals. This happened in New York, Michigan, Quebec and numerous places in Europe as well.</p>
<p>Also, the FDA hasn't even fully approved the vaccines, either. They pushed it through via "emergency" measures. Some emergency. Even if you grant the maximum lethality for this, and also grant that it was a direct cause of death, rather than a complication (which is what it actually is), it has only actually killed roughly 0.037% of the global population.</p>
<p>But not really, since it is also known at this point that the vast majority of fatalities have had serious comorbidities (diabetes, heart disease, cancers, lung diseases, etc), in addition to being in the average life expectancy range already. People with diabetes, for example, have a life expectancy of ten fewer years than the average. In the US, that places them in the age range of 68.</p>
<p>And what about the corporations? Don't you find it even a little fucking suspicious how coordinated their response has been from the start? They had "social distancing" placards and signs up and ready almost straight away. They had ads running in lockstep with each other all over the place. And most telling of all, they didn't even protest to the government requiring them to lock down. When is the last time any corporation willingly said "yeah, okay government, we'll do a thing that will directly impact our bottom line in an extremely negative way".</p>
<p>No. Just no. I'm a business owner myself, and nobody does this, not if they want to remain in business. But, that's the thing. Ultimately, the big corporate entities weren't forced to close, not for very long. It was the small, locally owned businesses that have been shuttered, due to restrictions being placed upon them, while the massive places were allowed to continue operating.</p>
<p>NONE of this has made ANY fucking sense from the beginning.</p>

        <p>The big corporations knew from the start they'd get bailed out(they always do), and it's not like it takes an act of God to get signs/placards printed out. Advertisements being the same is also no big surprise, they had a focus group and came up with whatever they thought would keep eyes on brands during all the downtime people suddenly had, and sold that idea around no surprise there that's what they always do.</p>
<p>I gotta ask you though, what was the end game of all of this? What was actually the point at the end of the day of this if it wasn't just the old fogies that run the country trying to protect their own asses and taking everything around them down with them?</p>

        <p>He didn't get the reaction he was expecting, so now he's at a loss and trying to save face by trying to play it off like he was "just trolling all along".  </p>
<p>Which might be true! But, if we accept that to be the case, then that also means that his initial comment was nothing but insincere fuckery. So if he tries to come back with any more of that asinine moral grandstanding about "empathy", we can just assume he doesn't mean a word of it, and is "just trolling hahaha rofl lolol".</p>

        <p>Our entire society lived with flu without the need to shut down.  Covid is a little worse than flu, especially on the scale of things like small pox or the plague.  My great aunt died of a common cold 10 years ago, are we now justified in limiting human contact until we can prevent even one more cold death?  I hope not, because as a surviving relative, that's stupid.  Living life and making the most of the time you have is more important than extending people who are nearing death's time.  They can take all the precautions they want, and find their own balance, but robbing the vast majority of the world's population of joy and freedom is not a reasonable trade.</p>
<p>Are you really doing all  you can to prevent rabies?  Did you take your rabies shot?  I mean, maybe you are a dog catcher or a vet and actually had a reason to, but you probably aren't.  Still maybe a bat or squirrel will bite you without you noticing... better get that rabies shot.</p>
