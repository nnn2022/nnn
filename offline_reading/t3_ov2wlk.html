        <p>no 'dining establishment' needs to know my health status or my vax status.  I stubbed my toe this weekend are they going to ask about that next? Am i getting medical care for my wounded toe, do i have anti botics for my toe? am i contagious from my toe?</p>
<p>and this begins the downfall of small businesses-- do not ask for a bailout, do not ask for loans, do not complain.</p>

        <p>&rt;“Individual businesses – it’s their own choice. We’ll see if it comes from the state or not,” said FNB diner Jonathan Dumaine. “At some point, it’s better for society just to say, ‘<strong><em>Hey, we’re not trying to take your rights away, we’re just trying to make sure that everyone can live their own life to have as much freedom as possible.’</em></strong>”</p>
<p>Oh, so you want to see what is the best way to go out of business as quickly as possible?! Okay, fuck with your customer base, and tell them they're not welcome. Tell them they're not welcome because YOU know what is best for them, and insult their intelligence by telling them YOU think they are second class citizens. Oh yeah, that's a sound business model, I am sure this will go great with the customer!</p>
<p>Dumaine says it is not about taking any one's rights away, but yet they're denying people the right to just to be left the fuck alone, and eat in at an establishment in peace. Fucking hypocrite.</p>
