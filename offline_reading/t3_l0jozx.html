    <strong>Masks yes, lockdowns no...</strong>
    <p><p>While I definitely think that masks are helpful in peventing the virus fron spreading, especially in my country the lockdown is not helping. In addition to that, people are not following the rules anyway. So while I do think that precautions should be taken, and that i cannot wait for the vaccines, i do believe that the lockdowns should finally end. What i want to know is, what do you think of all this?</p></p>

        <p>Similarly to what is described in your article, in the one linked below it shows that in counties where a mask mandate was implemented the number of cases was reduced. If ill be honest, there is probably some middle ground to all this as both articles make sense althiugh they are contradictory.

        <p>so see there's no real correlation between a mask being effective and it not being effective.  Now I don't know about you but if something inconvenient and uncomfortable in my life has no use or purpose I get rid of it.  Ask my two ex wives LOL</p>

        <p><em>A</em> MASK  is effective. This is the problem, on a larger scale where there are many secondary and tertiary factors which influence everything, you can't say with certainty why there is a discrepancy between counties w mask mandates and those w/o.</p>

        <p>Keep your head firmly implanted in your anus if you like.  The data shows that mask mandates and no mask mandates show almost the exact same infection rate.  That tells me they aren't working.  You want to know why?  Because they're attached to people and people are fallible.  They scratch their noses, wipe their faces, and do all kinds of things to spread disease without even thinking about it.  You can believe in your mask and it's superpowers all you want but the data is right there for you to read.  More data isn't hard to find.  But I'll bet all you're looking for is data that supports your position aren't you?  LOL.  Mask mandates don't work, didn't ever work, and will never work.  But as I've said in the past.  If you want to wear one to feel safer by all means do.  That is your right.  But it IS NOT NOR WILL IT EVER BE YOUR RIGHT TO TELL ME WHAT TO DO.  That's what you people seem to forget.  The same rights that apply to me apply to you.  The data is difficult to argue with.  They don't really do much in the public sector.  Subsequently I am not going to be uncomfortable, itchy, short of breath, etc, just so you and your ilk can feel 'safer'.  Your safety is your problem not mine.</p>

        <p>No, a cloth mask is ineffective in stopping the spread of a microscopic, airborne virus. This is why doctors advocated not wearing masks back in Jan/Feb of 2020, and why all research into this issue has confirmed these assumptions.</p>

        <p>I'm curious what has indisputably proved to you that face diapers are a good thing?  The data shows that covid cases and hospititalizations skyrocketed AFTER face diapers became the norm.  Using logical reasoning, one could suspect that putting a germ net on your face to catch bacteria, pollen, dead cells, gasesous waste and viruses, will just lead to them being inhaled over and over.  What ends up on the outside of the face diaper ie. virus particles, WILL end up in your lungs.   Dead cells and bacteria can INCREASE the efficiency of viral transmission.  The warm moist environment of a face diaper helps the bacteria MULTIPLY.  Bacteria causes lung infections as well.    It seems after being aware of these obvious facts, some serious mental gymnastics would be required to believe face diapers aren't harmful.  So do you have any thought process other than ignoring and personally attacking the sources of things you may not want to believe?</p>

        <p>First of all you need to relax my guy, no need for insults. In response to your claims however, is it not that masks are supposed to be worn to peotect OTHERS from getting the virus? Meaning that if I wear a mask and have the virus and i am talking to you in person, there is a far lesser chance of me giving the virus to you. However, if you are not wearing a mask, you could still give it to me. (of course there are certain masks which prevent transmission and getting the virus). If you breathe all these bacteria, wastes and all the else you mentioned into your mask and inhale that, you are only keeping it to yourself so to speak,and not passing it on which is the entire point of wearing masks. Id like to hear your response of course.</p>

        <p>So, who is more likely to transmit a virus, someone who doesn't have the virus and is face diaper free, or someone who has the virus and is wearing a face diaper?  That is an important question with an obvious answer.  Since the face diaper increases your risk of CATCHING the virus, in the long run, it is also increasing your risk of TRANSMITTING it.</p>

        <p>In the real world, you cannot know for sure that you dont have the virus unless you test yourself constantly. Keeping this in mind, wearing a mask reduces the POTENTIAL risk of transmitting it, even if you don't have the virus. The "face diaper" doesnt increase your chance of getting the virus, if you are breathing particles with pathogens on them into your mask, you are ALREADY INFECTED. And to answer your question, if someone who doesnt have the virus is not wearing a mask, of course they cant spread it. They are not infected. But as I said before, this is impossible to know all the time in the real world.</p>

        <p>That's incorrect, masks don't prevent the spread. Masks can reduce the spread from one person to another <em>slightly</em> if you're actually sick and actually have symptoms when you wear it (also if the mask is n95 tier or higher, because paper and cloth masks are even more ineffective). If they significantly reduced the spread than cases wouldn't be "surging" for months. Hell, even data from CDC and WHO themselves prior to all the idiocracy shows that masks were never significantly effective at reducing transmission of respiratory viruses and that asymptomatic transmission is virtually non-existent.</p>
<p>I will never wear mask, because they are demoralizing, dehumanizing, depressing, horrible for animal life/the environment and most are manufactured in cramped, dirty sweatshops in countries like Bangladesh. 
If I'm ever sick i'll just stay at home untill I get better (which was you know, the norm like every flu season since always).</p>

<p>Also, a big concern that is generally overlooked. Children have been born into a society with masks. Faces are incredibly important to infants and toddlers; reading and connecting to them is key to their development. The children will only observe eyes. This could potentially limit a child's understanding of emotions later on in life. Many children will have their speech and social development stunted. This could cause extreme withdrawal socially later on in life and it's sad because more then likely the adult they become won't understand why they aren't socially connected with others.</p>

        <p>I agree, there will always be some consequences to these kind of things. This generation of teenagers is struggling immensely for example, because they cant see their friends and socially interact. I cant say about the social aspect the effects of masking will have on children, but i know for a fact my young btohers (ages 8 and 10) are struggling with school at home, which is not good for the education.</p>

        <p>dodo read the link I posted and get back to me will ya.  You seem like a reasonable and intelligent person so far.  That data is pretty hard to argue with.  The masks are doing nothing.  They're just 'feel good' measures.  We're dealing with a virus here.  You're going to get exposed to it eventually no matter what you do.  Either your immune system fights it off or it doesn't.  That sounds fatalistic and despite most of my commentary here I'm a pretty optimistic person.  All this is it media hype, hysteria, and it's the whole 'no smoking in the building' shit that we dealt with when that became a thing (fortunately I dip so that wasn't a problem for me).  We all apparently NEED someone to hate.  Maskers hate anti maskers.  Anti maskers hate maskers.  We argue, fuss, fight, and stay nice and distracted while our overlords line their pockets with our tax dollars and watch the children eat each other laughing the whole time from the safe confines of their multi million dollar compounds.</p>

        <p>You seem like a reasonable person. I wish you would understand why masks are part of the problem. </p>
<p>I consider them part of the lockdown, just like "social distancing", temperature checks, plexiglass, and the rest of the dystopia. People wear masks <em>precisely because</em> of the false narrative. Without the psychotic reaction to a 0.2% IFR virus, there would be no masks. Mask-wearing exists only due to this "new normal".  In fact, masks are the most visible symbol of this Orwellian psyop. Nothing screams "deadly global pandemic" more than seeing everyone wearing masks. </p>
<p>How can you have peace and forget for a second when everyone is masked, something that would never happen in normal times. This leads to deeper sinking into the mentality that we really must be living in such a dangerous time and that this really must be an "unprecedented" virus, otherwise we would have never had lockdowns and masks. You can get that the vast majority of people who believe the covid narrative believe it only because they see society's psychotic reaction to it, and therefore come to the conclusion that "damn, this virus really must be that scary and serious, and unlike any virus we've ever had before, otherwise why would governments all over the world be implementing all these measures?" Masks, like the lockdowns they are a part of, are what exacerbate the psychological phenomenon of this irrational fear and insanity. </p>
<p>People wear masks not because they choose to, but because they are brainwashed into believing there is a plague upon us. Just think...would anyone wear a mask or would any business implement them if it hadn't been for the media and their anointed quacks telling everyone that this virus is nothing like a really bad flu season we deal with every year...rather it is a once-in-a-millennium supervirus that would have lead to millions of dead bodies lining the streets of every major city in the world had it not been for these restrictions? </p>
<p>Also, look at how they literally programmed the masses to go from "please no one wear masks because it's unnecessary and might just make it worse" in the first three months of the year to a total complete reversal literally overnight of "everyone wear masks at all times, masks are the best weapon against this terrible virus". If that's not horrifyingly Orwellian enough, I don't know what to say. Masks feed the atmosphere of fear, panic, mass hysteria, while dehumanizing and demoralizing the population. The powers that be know this too, hence why they advocate for them so much and silence all science that goes against their narrative. Also, what is sad is how so many have accepted this abusive spouse syndrome. </p>
<p>We've come to the sad point of we're so afraid of more lockdowns, that we wouldn't mind muzzles just as long as our overlords please not lock is down again. This is exactly like a horribly abusive spouse who takes everything from you, including your self-worth and dignity, then makes you feel relief when they "allow" you something that was just your basic right. "Thanks for letting me go out with you for 20 minutes to get a hamburger tonight...I know it could be worse, you could not allow me to leave the house or talk to anyone for months while beating me up every night and starving me".</p>

        <p>Well i view the entire situation wuite differently. I have family members who to be honest, would not sirvive were they infected. I see this as doing my small part in protecting vulnerable people from this contagious virus. Although it is overblown how severe the whole thing is, with nearly 100M infected and 2M dead, i have no problem with wearing a mask if it helps to protect people. The problem i have with the lockdown is that it is not helping , at least where i am. I dont believe there is a hidden agenda to control people, i just think many governments are woefully unprepared to deal with this and are makinf stupid decisions which is making people angry.</p>

        <p>Sigh. There is literally no data to support masks working. Especially the flimsy fabrics we use. An n95 properly fitted mask possibly may give some protection, but even that protection is small, even negligible. The fact is that transmission rates are unaffected by high compliance with masks. There are places with nearly 100% compliance with high transmission rates, and there are high compliance places with low transmission rates. The same is true with low compliance places. </p>
<p>Compliance and being good about wearing masks literally does nothing just based on data, which indicates that they function as little more than a rabbit’s foot that you rub three times in a circular motion to confer “luck”.</p>
<p>What does work is social distancing. But unlike masks, enforcing distancing is very difficult. That’s why they do lockdowns because it forces people to social distance. However, it has unintended consequences of forcing people in cramped living conditions (like poorer people in the cities) and poor ventilation to rapidly spread pathogens amongst themselves. </p>
<p>So what we should do is stop lockdowns and mask mandates and just give simple guidance. Like don’t go out if you’re sick. Provide sick leave protections if people need to stay home because they don’t feel well. Trust that people will follow the guidance as needed because they are sentient beings with agency. And that’s it. That’s all you need.</p>

        <p>Interesting. Do you mind specifying in which places as you mentioned there is no correlation between mask usage and infection rates, and linking the source to me? From what studies ive read, there is a strong correlation between the correct usage of masks and transmission of the virus. Have you considered other factors which may explain why in some areas it seems mask usage is less effective?</p>
