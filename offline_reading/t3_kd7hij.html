    <strong>A brief thought on the major drawback of the mRNA vaccine. The alteration in the sequence of the viruses spike protein might lead to loss of immunity! A way to create demand for “new” vaccines.</strong>
    <p><p>The important thing here is that the novel mRNA vaccine contains only the information (mRNA) for your cells to produce the spike protein of the virus. With a conventional vaccination approach, you get an inactive or weakened virus. This means that your immune cells are in contact with several viral antigens and the antigen-presenting cells therefore present several viral proteins/antigens. Conversely, this means that when your immune cells (e.g. memory B cells and T cells) come into contact with one of these viral antigens again, they trigger the immune response, start producing antibodies etc. and neutralise the virus. Please correct if my reasoning is wrong or flawed here.</p>
<p>Now to the disadvantage of the mRNA vaccine, which carries the genetic code for only ONE small part of the virus. With this new vaccine, your antigen-presenting cells present only the one viral spike protein, because your cells have only received the information to produce this ONE "foreign" viral protein. Your memory cells "remember" this sequence and reactivate when they come into contact with it a second time.</p>
<p>This means that if the sequence of the viral spike protein mutates or god-forbid "somebody" artificially modifies the spike protein, the people whose immunity was acquired exclusively through vaccination would effectively be "unimmune". The immune cells were never in contact with the "rest" of the virus, and you have no active artificially acquired immunity.</p>
<p>I assume that if someone was both vaccinated and later came into contact with the native virus, the immune system would eventually adapt and respond to other viral antigens. This means that if they came into contact with a virus with a different spike protein, they would be immune. However, the question remains for those people who would only be immune to the virus because of the spike protein.</p>
<p>What do you guys think of that? Is this a way to recycle and create demand and excuses for new vaccines? Basically, you release the "same virus" with a mutated spike protein sequence, say the virus has mutated (oh no...), and everyone has to re-vaccinate. Make profit.</p>
<p>P.S. after some debate with my colleagues with PhD’s in relevant fields, it has been pointed out that the spike protein in not prone to mutation. However even though it is highly unlikely to mutate this doesn’t mean it can’t. Even worse someone could quite easily artificially modify it. Also a “smaller” change in the spike protein sequence would lower the avidity (combined binding strength between an antigen and a receptor)however would still trigger an immune response. A bigger change would mean the loss of immunity. So I am still trying to comprehend the reasoning behind a vaccine based on only one viral antigen.</p></p>

        <p>Isn't that the same with other vaccines though? Everyone gets the same flu shot.</p>

        <p>It is, but it seems stranger in the mRNA vaccine v.s. the attenuated vaccines. Given that the goal of the mRNA vaccines being producing those crowns inside your cells.</p>
