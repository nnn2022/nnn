    <strong>Going to be kicked out at 18 for not being vaccinated</strong>
    <p><p>You read the title correctly, and yes there are a lot of things playing into my parents decisioning for me having to move but the nail in the coffin is the vaccine, if I go ahead and submit to that they'll be little angels and I get to live freely at their house. For some background I was working 20-35 hours a week as a dishwasher since I was 15 and then Covid fucked my hours. It was okay the first lockdown, second was whatever I was still 17 and didn't have to pay 500$ a month rent yet, third lockdown I was completely over it, trying to explain The Great Reset to my friends and family with no engagement from them they just dismiss my ideas as crazy. I've been paying rent on time and fully every month despite the harsh economic outlook right now and my family is saying I'm not doing enough and need to go to uni/ work 2 jobs (its fucking bullshit I invest 90% of my money, have 30-50k fluctuating in crypto and GME rn and am trying to gtfo but its not doable financially yet) to continue living with them.</p>
<p>I've quit my job but I've kept paying rent fully and on time for the past 3 months. They will not stop harrassing me about working again because they think it'll get me closer to being independent but that is far from the truth. I currently collect unemployment insurance since the Canadian government wants to give free money to anybody who doesn't work (no im serious). SO WHY WOULD I GO BE A CORPORATE SHILL TO THIS FRAUD AND WEAR MASK TO EARN THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY I AM CURRENTLY GETTING FOR FREE? Let me get one thing straight though, I'm not a freeloader and never will be, I understand my parents have no obligations towards me whatsoever but I'm just feeling a bit bad, like I've been done wrong. I would work if I thought it would get me closer to getting out of my current situation but that's not the case. </p>
<p>My only hopes right now are as follows :</p>
<ol>
<li>The Covid-19 Fraud gets uncovered and the players responsible are held accountable</li>
<li>The Financial, Big Tech , Big Pharma , Big Government criminals are held accountable for their crimes against humanity</li>
<li>GME short position gets closed by hedge funds, market crashes and crypto skyrockets and we create a new monetary system that is not controlled by a central entity like the fed</li>
</ol>
<p>If any of these things can happen right now that would be amazing, it would confirm months of my research and uphold all the values I resonate with and have been fighting for since I quit my job and took a stand to stop serving this corporate system of death. I'm not a communist, or socialist I enjoyed the freedoms I had for the past 17 years but those weren't under capitalism, it's always been a ponzi scheme that benefits the few at the top. I don't care how hard you work right now there is no way to bootstrap your way out of poverty into the middle class without a substantial handout or financial gain. Another thing that upsets me is the people who took the designated route are in a WORSE position then me financially but since they're in uni/college and vaxxed they're awesome and gonna have a great future despite being 10k+ in debt already with no skills... </p>
<p>I want the truth to come to light, I want to stop pretending like my parents are correct and that I'm a subhuman second class dummy who needs to take a vaccine and cover my face just to participate freely in society. </p>
<p>Idk how much longer I can do this, I don't know what's next for me and there's no way I can plan a future for myself given the current circumstances...</p></p>

        <p>You got to do what you believe in. Bottom line is if you are a free thinker and don't feel like taking a shot is justified then stand up for yourself. All this horse s<strong><em> about worrying about other people's health is bogus. I'm responsible for my own health... Just like your responsible for your own health... Someone f</em></strong>*** coughs on you take precautions and get checked out. Starting to feel tight in the chest, go get checked out. But the fact that this is supposedly 99.9% survivable which is comparable to the common cold or flu I don't understand why it's such a big push to get a needle in the arm, do you?</p>
<p>I mean measle mumps rubella... Okay I'm getting that shot and it's proven to work. Tetanus shots, no problem I'll take those all day... Some s<strong><em> where I'm going to survive likely if I just drink some orange juice and get some rest, why the f</em></strong> do I need a shot? I'm a hygienic person, I don't go to work if I feel sick, I don't cough and sneeze on people, I wash my hands frequently.... But I'm your modern-day Jew now and the US federal government has decided to play the role of the modern Nazi....</p>

        <p>Yes I’ve lost my oldest friend because he’s blinded by the propaganda, and got the injections. Not a single time will he engage with my honest questions, but now just resorts to calling me mad and a “dick.” Goodbye my old friend.</p>
<p>The bottom line is we are facing persecution because we do not want to take part in a clinical trial. That is it.</p>

        <p>Yeah man, thankfully me and my friends can look past that with each other. One of my friends has 1 dose (convinced him not to get another one) and another one of my friends got 2 doses so he could travel (I disagree with that , look down on THAT 1 DECISION but other than that I still fw him) but he’s completely aware of what’s going on and isn’t supporting it now.</p>

        <p>Well it's starting to come to light that the vaxxers are spreading covid...the vax blocks the virus from affecting the body and the vitals...but it's not killing it by pumping the person up with immunity...the virus is apparently thriving in the body and the person is asymptomatic....we are all at risk now more than ever to catch this..if what NBC is saying is accurate...</p>

        <p>You are young, so you don't fully understand that the little guy never wins.  This precludes 1 and 2, and at least part of 3, from ever happening. </p>
<p>On the rest, your struggle mirrors much of the western world presently.  Our "parents" (employers) say we have to get the vax or "leave" (get fired).</p>
<p>No matter what age we are, no matter our position in life, we are now forced to answer a question:  "where do you draw the line?"  This question, and our response to it, will define the next several generations.</p>

        <p>Alright first of all, you do realize that cerb is ending soon and you will need a job, if you want to be independent you need a job, you can’t freeload off cerb forever (ends in 2 months), you still pay taxes on it and eventually could have to pay some of it back, and once you stop making cerb you’ll slowly start moving backwards spending your savings. You need to get a job and start making real passive income if you want to move out. There’s no point in trying to convince people in my opinion of what’s going on until they start learning on there own or start to realize things don’t make sense.</p>

        <p>I get it, jobs are needed but they are not scarce AT ALL right now; I could go apply at 5 different places and have a job within a week it is not difficult, the only problem is the incentive, once CERB ends I’ll definitely get a job and I’m also thinking about the taxes I have a little bit saved</p>

        <p>My heart goes out to you.
Do you have friends or family you can live with, while you sort things out?
Hang in there.
Reach out to social services if necessary.
You sound like a smart person with a lot of potential.</p>
<p>You are our future.  We need you.
All the best</p>
