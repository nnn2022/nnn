        <p>I have been called a conspiracy theorist more in the last few months  than I had been in the last few years until the pandemic. I am an investigative researcher. Most people read articles or watch videos that were written or created with my work and don't even know it. I'm not a conspiracy theorist. I spend months, sometimes longer, digging up information on one subject at a time. I dig deep. Very deep. I get to know the subjects intimately. </p>
<p>Everyone needs to get very familiar with the Great Reset. It will happen. A "new economic order" will be the result of the Great Reset. It is scheduled to take place after the presidential inauguration in January. It will change everything. </p>
<p>The world economy has been destroyed. It was going to collapse with a pandemic or not. Whether the virus was released purposely or not, I don't know but, I do know that it will be the excuse used for the collapse. Which will be saved by the Great Reset. The banking industry wasn't going to take responsibility for the economic destruction it is responsible for. It needed a scape goat. Pandemics are good scape goats apparently. And the Great Reset is meant to make all the bankers and rich people look like the saviors of humanity after everything implodes.</p>
<p>Call me what you will but, all the information is out there. Its not hidden. It rarely is. Most people don't take the time to look for it. Look up the Great Reset. Look up Davos. Look up the World Economic Forum. You'll find what you need to know.</p>

        <p>No. That won't change anything, unfortunately. It will happen no matter who is in office. </p>
<p>This is where most people slip up. The two party system here in America is an illusion, a show. If you look at every presidency, there is always a policy or two that is carried out no matter what administration is in office. Sometimes its a war that would've happened no matter what. It could be an economic policy that gets implemented no matter what. Its always something, every four years. </p>
<p>Despite all the apparent disdain of one another, what is the one issue that the president and Biden agree on right now? It is the one policy or agenda that is going to be implemented by the next administration, no matter who wins the election. Operation Warp Speed. The vaccine development and distribution project. Both candidates agree on it, for the most part. It will go forward and we will all be subjected to it, no matter what.</p>
<p>Everything else means very little. Every president will be allowed to carry out some of their campaign promises, if they so choose but, there are always certain things every president and administration is directed to make happen.</p>
<p>It is all a show and the president plays the lead role. The script is set, with some opportunity for a little improvisation from time to time. But, the ultimate objectives of each term will get accomplished. </p>
<p>The economy is going to collapse no matter what or who. There is no way to avoid it. The Great Reset is the solution and all world leaders will have no choice but to go along with it. It will be implemented and so will Operation Warp Speed.</p>

        <p>Yet we’re called crazy for noticing what there saying.  Now i do not think people are necessarily stupid for not believing us.   I think they’re just not ready to hear the truth because it will shatter there reality they’ll learn that there entire life has been based on a lie and that can be very hard to deal with so try to show them compassion, because all of us was one of them at one point.</p>

        <p>Incoming ban on cash. Usher in a new digital currency controlled by the elite that can be easily manipulated because its just 1s and 0s on a computer screen. Incoming mandatory vaccinations in order to receive your digital wallet. They will make it sound like a new global currency will solve all our problems. However the centralized authority which controls the printing of this currency will effectively control the entire world. By increasing and restricting the money supply over time you can tighten your grip on the entire world's assets. The Great Reset agenda plans to do this exact thing, and they plan to abolish all private property. Citizens will not be allowed to own anything. The government will own all property.</p>
