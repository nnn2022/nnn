    <strong>The imposition on family relations</strong>
    <p><p>I went on a trip with my father to Lambeau Field for the Packers Family night. While in the middle of the 300 mile trip, he asked me to look up if they had any Covid restrictions like the requirement to show my vaccination card of which I don't have. Gee, I wonder why. I knew he'd ask why which he did later on. We passed a vaccination tent and he offered to pay. He proceeded to ask me why I didn't want the vaccination. My answer was the same as always, "because the last time I ever had something remotely close to a cold was in December of 2019". My mother of whom I live with has been vaccinated also but isn't pathological to the extent most are to virtue me into getting it. She got hers and left me alone. In the grand-scheme of it all, I'm blessed compared to others.</p>
<p>It really is a sad time when even your family believes the government has their backs. I will say though, it's really strange my dad religiously watches CNN. Fact of the matter is, it's his choice even though my ears were bleeding upon waking up to it. Never had I watched it and my god, it sure is fear porn. Mentioning how the Sturgid motorcycle rally is a possible super spreader. It really won't stop until the television is turned off.</p>
<p>I notice some have families like mine where they live and let live while others are not so kind to such a dichotomy. Often causing families to become against one another just as politics had (there's a reason for it). One realization I had to make in the strange year that 2020 was is that many are so connected to the machine they can't disconnect from it. Separating those that question from those that abide and accept. Knowing I outgrew my parents in understanding the world doesn't make me better than them. Maybe, for sake of progress, I can debate them on subjects where we both can grow. The social structure in these times has weaponized words. They've been given too much meaning that then transforms into the weaponization of morality. The real catch 22 where morality is a thin line between living and letting live to wishing death upon the unvaccinated. Those that are cognizant and lack resentment see it while the others are almost on par with demons wishing you to say in hell with them. This notion goes far deeper than just Covid itself but not the purpose of this post.</p>
<p>These times have made me stronger and smarter with my speech and assertions than ever before. Especially considering it took me 27 years to find my voice. A nice little diagnosis of Aspergers ensured that one. Again, just a word used to describe my differences. My mind was built to question which isn't so fun.</p>
<p>To end I'd like to point out more evidence that this was a plan all along. Written in our music and portrayed in our movies. Only those whom lived see the correlations.</p>
<p>A Perfect Circle \~ The Doomed</p>
<p>New beginning, new word</p>
<p>And the word was death (covid)</p>
<p>And the word was without light</p>
<p>The new beatitude</p>
<p>Good luck, you're on your own</p></p>

        <p>It's a cult at this point.  The only thing you can do is what you are doing.  Answer their questions with the truth and show them your thought process.</p>

        <p>It's really sad how this is turning people against family and friends. I'm surprised the media/govt/pharma hasn't released a campaign to directly say "if you spend time with someone unvaccinated, you are just as bad and you're putting everyone else at risk" to put the final nail in the coffin.</p>

        <p>Watch this become the reality in the months ahead. It's not going to end. There is no goal post, it's a room with collapsing walls. Pretty soon it'll exceed the compressibility of peoples wills that many end up snapping. Hence why it is indeed the beginning of humanities final war. Not from nation against nation but people fighting people. The most unstable land on the planet being America because we're so indoctrinated into materialistic values without a sense of community. Hyper individualized to the point all people see beyond their eyes are possible enemies.</p>
