    <strong>Reminder #35,361: Do not allow yourself to fall for the division tactics of the elite</strong>
    <p><p>Edit: Pretty large read. I didn't mean for it to become this big. Forgive me.  </p>
<p><strong>Here's a TL;DR:</strong></p>
<p>Outrage and intolerance causes division. Division causes undue stress on you and fatigues your relationships. Do not let the very loud minority backed by elite interests do this to you. Treasure your fellow man and try to see their side every now and then. You'll be surprised with what happens! </p>
<p>Love you all!</p>
<p><strong>Original post:</strong></p>
<p>I'm a black Muslim man. I stand with both good men and women, any race including white people, Christians as well as any other religion or a lack thereof, and anyone I may have missed. And yes, I stand with the left wing, right wing, and independent constituents.</p>
<p>Don't fall for the elite's divisive tactics and allow them to subsume your heart with hate. Love your fellow man as if they're family.</p>
<p>I don't care if you're a crackhead living in a trailer park or a hugely successful business magnate. You're worthy of basic human decencies and respect.</p>
<p>Afford others what you'd like to have afforded to you. No one has ever gone wrong in this world by doing so.</p>
<p>Authoritarianism relies on centralization of beliefs, political power, economics, and much more.  A decentralized world, where every person's God given rights are respected and upheld by every other person, is the right way forward.</p>
<p>Here's a little game you can make out of this: The next time you see someone with a diametrically opposing viewpoint to yours, ask them about it. Express genuine interest in your fellow man. Genuinely consider their points and see if you can understand them. Give some of your own viewpoints in a respectful manner and get a conversation going. You'll quickly notice going about life in this manner will grant you more respect and admiration from your peers, regardless of the topic at hand.</p>
<p>Again, I'm a Muslim. It is the biggest belief I have in my life. However, I've read the Bible, spoken to Christians, and I have plenty of really good non-Muslim friends. </p>
<p>I've even got friends that I wouldn't have expected to attract. A good friend of mine is Russian and had a very distorted view of Muslims before I talked to him. I also know a lot more about Orthodox Christianity and Russian culture as a result and I enjoy speaking to him about his experiences back home.</p>
<p>Some of my friends and family members were staunchly against having the right to refuse the vaccine. I've since changed some of their minds on this. I've also realized that many people are simply afraid and are trying to protect themselves and their loved ones. Other people may be simply complying because they have a genuine gap in knowledge. Other than in radicalized echo chambers like Twitter and Facebook, most people are genuinely not trying to be malicious.  It's a give and take.</p>
<p>Take prejudice and bias as a challenge. Enjoy changing people's minds about who you are. Enjoy having your mind changed about the biases you've accrued over the course of your life.</p>
<p>My life is better because of this, without a doubt.</p></p>
