    <strong>Viruses, Vaccines, the COVID-19 Virus, and the COVID-19 Vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>I've recently done some research (by which, I mean asking a friend a bunch of questions about the vaccine in conjunction with light DuckDuckGo-ing) in order to increase my understanding of the COVID-19 virus and how its vaccine works. I wanted to compare that information to more typical viruses and vaccines we're all familiar with.</p>
<p>I'm sure most of this is common knowledge, but I wanted to write this up anyway. I think that to properly reject the vaccine, I need to have a more comprehensive understanding of what that <em>means</em> and I think it would be helpful to share my findings as well.</p>
<p><strong>Here's how most vaccines and viruses work:</strong></p>
<p><em>(by most, I mean the typical ones: measles, mumps, and rubella; polio, tetanus, etc.)</em></p>
<p>A vaccine works by "teaching" the body's white blood cells to fight off a virus. Most vaccines contain a deactivated or weakened ("live-attenuated") virus.</p>
<p>When a virus reaches someone who is <em>not</em> vaccinated against that virus, the person will be infected and become sick; the virus will survive long enough to transmit to others, replicate, and possibly mutate.</p>
<p>When a virus reaches someone who <em>is</em> vaccinated, their immune system will kill the virus before they get sick and before the virus has the chance to be transmitted to others.</p>
<p><em>(Some viruses can still be carried by animals - even though we've achieved herd immunity in many cases, some viruses could be picked back up again and spread within the human population if we don't consistently vaccinate)</em></p>
<p><strong>The COVID-19 Vaccines:</strong> these are not typical vaccines as they do not contain a live or dead SARS-CoV-2 virus.</p>
<p><em>(please excuse my somewhat childish analogies; I think they're funny)</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html">mRNA</a>:</p>
<p>The mRNA vaccine gives our cells instructions to create a protein piece (a "spike protein") that matches part of the coronavirus cell. Our bodies create antibodies in an immune response toward that protein piece; these antibodies are intended to fight the virus. An even more simplified analogy would be like getting a paint-by-number of a horse in the mail, doing the paint-by-number, then studying it so you know how to fight a horse in real life.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/viralvector.html">Viral Vector</a>:</p>
<p>The viral vector vaccine uses a modified version of a different virus as a vehicle for a gene which is unique to the coronavirus. This unique coronavirus gene triggers our cells to create the spike protein, then our bodies create antibodies to fight the virus. This would be like painting a picture of a cow and you add a horse in the background to prepare yourself for your horse fight.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>The flu vaccine experiences a "<a href="https://www.infectiousdiseaseadvisor.com/home/topics/respiratory/influenza/is-a-leaky-vaccine-mechanism-responsible-to-decreased-flu-season-vaccine-effectiveness/">leaky vaccine effect</a>".Â </p>
<p>The effect is explained more simply in <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/leaky-vaccines-can-produce-stronger-versions-of-viruses-072715#What-We-Learned-from-Chickens">this article</a>:</p>
<p>&rt;Vaccinated individuals may get sick but have less severe symptoms, but the virus survives long enough to transmit to others, which allows it to survive and spread throughout a population.</p>
<p>This result mirrors the paragraph above about how an unvaccinated individual's body reacts to a virus. This is also likely what happens with the COVID-19 vaccine - the <em>only</em> benefit from getting vaccinated against COVID-19 is that it prevents (or lessens the impact of) active sickness; there is no evidence (yet) that it prevents the virus from replicating, mutating, and being transmitted to others. The COVID-19 vaccine might not be "leaky" but it very well could be. We don't yet have evidence proving its real-world, long-term efficacy.</p>
<p><em>Furthermore</em>, a leaky vaccine could create leeway for a virus to mutate, which means it becomes "smarter" and learns how to get past your previous vaccination. This occurs with the common flu (which is why it's recommended to get the flu shot every year). This is also reportedly happening with COVID-19. A leaky vaccine could potentially be <em>more</em> dangerous as a whole than no vaccine, because it encourages the virus to mutate.</p>
<p>I realize I'm not an expert and if I've gotten anything glaringly wrong here, please correct me. I don't necessarily mean for this to be deeply educational or academic, but I found it helpful to organize my thoughts here. Hopefully y'all find it helpful, too.</p></p>
