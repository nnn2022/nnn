    <strong>Has this ruined anyone else's trajectory of life?</strong>
    <p><p>Due to the COVID scamdemic, I now can't move to Asia like I wanted, to do freelance IT.</p>
<p>I could have gotten a GOLD VISA in a place like Japan or Taiwan, and done stuff freelance, and getting away from my shitty country (The UK). But thanks to all this, I can't move ever. </p>
<p>I refuse to take the jab, as well as refuse to wear a mask, and to even take a COVID "test". I'll never do any of that, and it seems to me like you can only move to these places if you're obedient and do what you're told. If you want to get on flights, you need the test and a vaccine, wear a mask throughout the entire duration of your flight, and then quarantine for two weeks in a hotel, on your dime. I just won't do it.</p>
<p>So fuck you, elites. You've won. I wouldn't consider my life "ruined", but you have utterly changed my life plan, and what I wanted to do with my life. Now I'm stuck in shitty UK, unemployed, and surrounded my morons, and the disgusting culture that's devoured our nation as of late. I will probably have to get a wagecuck job (that's if I get one, I am currently being ignored - not rejected - but ignored by pretty much everyplace I apply to. My situation, as a young early 20s, is fucked. I feel so hopeless).</p>
<p>(and no I cannot find a job in IT. Not only the UK goverment(?) imported hundreds of thousands of people from Hong Kong who are far more skilled than I am, but the job market is barren, and I fear that also there will be some kind of Cyber "pandemic" soon, as in a crash or a total wipeout. It's becoming all too terrifying). </p>
<p>So I (sort of) know what direction this whole thing is going towards, and if I'm not put in a quarantine prison and forced-fed a vaccine, I will probably be stuck in my parents house until they inevitably get sick of me, because I'm never complying with this sickening NWO. I'm repulsed, and I don't see it improving anytime soon. It'll probably be so quick, that most people won't have time to think when it hits us (the actual big crisis). </p>
<p>What I will do now is unclear to me, I will just invest in precious metals and hope that will at least put me ahead of the game.</p></p>

        <p>Honestly I was one of the few to benefit. I was able to work multiple jobs and get a lot of money, graduate a year early, and get a stimulus check. Wouldn’t have been possible with out work and school from home. That being said, I am not a moron and saw hundreds lose their jobs and people lose their business as well as a few friends who lost their lives to the pandemic but not the virus. I don’t know anyone personally who has lost their life to the virus but do know people whose lives were ruined or made substantially harder. You’d have to have zero critical thinking skills to support these lockdowns/mandates while watching the people around you have their lives ruined</p>

        <p>After a life of avoiding my personal issues, I finally began going to therapy in mid 2019 to work on my social anxiety that comes with meeting new people, and my other longterm issues with maintaining relationships. By the spring of 2020, I was really making progress.</p>
<p>It might night seem like a huge deal to some people, but for a guy like me in my 50s, it took a lot of effort to admit I was kinda fucked up and willing to actually talk about it and work on it so I could be a better and happier dad, husband, friend, and person.</p>
<p>Then, the lockdowns happened and even though I've continued with remote therapy sessions, I feel like much of the progress I was making was lost. How am I supposed to work on my issues in social situations when socializing is basically fucking illegal? And with most of my friends being doomers, my issues with personal relationships haven't gotten any better.</p>
<p>I know that others have had it MUCH worse than I have due to lockdowns, but I'm still bitter and sad about how it has fucked up the first time in my life where I'm actually trying to better myself.</p>

<p>I've spent the last 15 years building up a tourism business and learning languages to travel.  I speak five languages fluently, and I am a veritable expert in the tourism industry.</p>
<p>I think tourism is dead, but in any case I will not be getting an experimental gene therapy shot into my arm.  If that means I can't travel, well, there goes the last 15 years of my life basically.</p>

<p>I am mildly disabled with weak muscles and balance living in a small town with few jobs that I can do (especially good paying ones). I am almost 33. 2020 was supposed to be the year I burn the candle at both ends until I succeed. I knew I didn’t have much time left to escape a certain fate so I was prepared to go a little crazy to get where I wanted.</p>
<p>Every month we step closer to a global police state. I am appalled at Canada’s descent into this. It’s revealed just how weak the people are now. They are happy to have eroded their freedom while virtue signaling. People who has no dreams or ambition are seen as heroes for lazing around eating fast food. </p>
<p>Today staying home and playing World of Warcraft for 7 hours a day is seen as heroic but wanting to have barbecues with friends is wrong.</p>
<p>It’s every shut in’s wet dream and if they add UBI to it they will jizz in their pants even more. I’m someone who has had to live with restrictions my whole life based on my disability. These clowns just volunteer for a substandard life while elites make billions and take their freedoms away.</p>

        <p>I bought a sailboat intending to fix it up and sail the world.</p>
<p>Lockdowns hit about a week later, the boatyard locked down for 3 months and I couldn't get to the boat. </p>
<p>My sister asked me to come work for her as a cook as she was shorthanded due to people being allowed to leave temporarily. I ended up working there for a year, and only getting to work on the boat every other weekend, when I had a Friday off. I helped get them through the summer shorthanded, then through the winter when it got tough. In case you wonder, I could only work on the boat in weekends because it's a 6 hour drive to it, on the other side of the state.</p>
<p>So I quit my job, now that they were able to finally hire someone to take my place, as people are coming out of their houses. But I can't help but think about what I might need to contend with when traveling.</p>

        <p>We had just invested our savings and started a business without assistance that was doing really well, and we were trying to start a family. Two years later and we're being forced to take government loans to keep our business afloat and I can't get access to my doctor's to find out why we can't get pregnant. The window of opportunity for us to have a family is quickly closing and I feel like everything I've worked for and everything I hoped for has been taken from me.</p>

        <p>The people who will be successful in this plandemic are the ones who take action and persevere towards their goals.</p>
<p>Perseverance is when you come to an obstacle you figure out a way around, through, under, over that obstacle.  Guess what?  There will always be obstacles, plandemic or not.</p>

        <p>I’m from the UK too I had rented my house out and was travelling round Australia.. the scamdemic ended that and I’m back on the island too! Don’t give up just yet there are millions fighting back and these vaccine passports can’t happen if enough don’t consent. I just watched the pushback on YouTube would highly recommend it’s things like this that give hope.
I still hope that one day I can get back Australia and live free again I hope that you get to realise your dreams (even if slightly different) too 🌈♥️</p>

        <p>I've been planning to go to Japan for 20 years. I had decided that 2022 would be the year, and I'd been making plans and preparing for it.</p>
<p>But now that it doesn't look like international travel will be possible without "the mark," that dream is gone.</p>

        <p>I'm 40 and not a business owner, so thankfully I have only been extremely inconvenienced. I hadn't yet upgraded to a bigger, more expensive home, which was my original plan. Now I want to completely move states and start over, most likely taking a $10 pay cut in the process. My future was supposed to be filled with traveling vacations. Now I believe it will consist of homesteading, in case this gets worse or happens again.</p>

        <p>I was going to start an apprenticeship in plumbing with my local union but then decided against it because I’m not even sure if I want to live in the state of PA anymore with how insane people have become. I don’t feel like I can even plan for my future because of this whole scamdemic. Day to day I feel like I am just bracing myself for what crazy thing is next.</p>

        <p>My job and industry thrived, so that was a great blessing to me and my family. But I worry about my kids.</p>
<p>One is a freshman this year, and besides moving to high school, he's the only one from his junior high. So he's friends with kids he has never actually seen, save a minute or two at lunch or something. Quarantine rules for exposure had him at home for most of the year, and besides the obvious social aspect, he's not doing well in school at all. Why would he? Staring at a laptop all day until it's time to do homework on the laptop all night is not what a 14 year old needs. </p>
<p>His GPA is low enough to threaten one of his scholarship programs, which would provide him with free in-state tuition for college. If he loses that, yes, some is on him. He didn't do some of his work, lied about it, he's 14. They all do that. I think school-from-home was a major factor too. His teachers know his screen name. They haven't sat with him to work one on one to help him where he needs extra attention. They don't know him. They can't pass him in the hallway and say, "Don't forget, quiz tomorrow!" If he loses that scholarship, that is at least a hundred thousand dollars this has cost him, and that debt will be with him for most of his life.</p>
<p>I'm annoyed for myself, like most people, but I'm absolutely devastated for him, and I hope he can pull it out. We're helping as much as we can, but it's tough.</p>
