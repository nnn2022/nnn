    <strong>Mask Debate in General</strong>
    <p><p>"Anti-Maksers": "If I'm healthy and do not have the virus, then I'm not going to wear a mask. A business does have the right to refuse service which is why i choose to not patron those businesses."</p>
<p>Loons: "You are the most SELFISH person in the whole world. I hope you get Covid and die."</p>
<p>Loons on another post: "Come on people. We have to SAVE THE WORLD!!! Wear your mask to show you care about dying people, but make sure to not do anything else that might matters"</p>
<p>IF YOU ARE NOT A LOON AND ACTUALLY CARE, THEN SHUT UP ABOUT MASKS AND GET TO WORK. CHRISTMAS CHEER BETTER COME EARLY THIS YEAR! START DONATING STORE-NEW SOCKS AND UNDERWEAR TO HOMELESS SHELTERS, WASH YOUR CLOTHES BEFORE DONATING THEM, GET WITH YOUR CHURCH FOR FOOD DRIVES, DONATE MONEY OR TIME TO ORGANIZATIONS THAT HELP 3RD WORLD COUNTRIES AS THEY CANNOT "SELF-QUARANTINE" AND STAY HOME (THEY WILL RUN OUT OF FOOD AND WATER AS THEY CANNOT SIMPLY "BUY EXTRA" AND THEIR NEIGHBORS CANNOT SPARE THEIRS), JOIN OR MAKE LOCAL SUPPORT GROUPS ON SOCIAL MEDIA THAT ARE ABOUT THOSE SUFFERING WITH STRESS AGGRIEVATED ILLNESSES, CHECK SITES LIKE "GO FUND ME" AND DONATE A COUPLE DOLLARS TO A FEW (MAKE SURE THEY ARE LEGITIMATE), AND OVERALL PUT EFFORT INTO BEING A PART OF YOUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES, IF YOU ARE ABLE OF COURSE.</p></p>
