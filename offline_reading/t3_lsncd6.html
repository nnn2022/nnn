    <strong>How to go about explaining the vaccine to old people?</strong>
    <p><p>So my grandparents have been watching local news and they believe the caronavirus is extremely deadly to the point where they don’t want me visiting and my grandma apologized for hugging me the other day. My grandmother had it in the past and is fine, my grandpa obviously sleeps with her and is in the same household/ room all day everyday (somehow his test was negative) anyway they are gung ho about the vaccine. </p>
<p>In the past I’ve had a horrible reaction to a vaccine that almost killed me, I was in the ICU for a week and left me paralyzed (I’m basically fine now I just had to go through several months of physical and occupational therapy) </p>
<p>Anyway, my aunt who’s ‘special’ (their daughter), lives in a special needs home and had to get the vaccine, she is now in a horrible state physically, falling down constantly, and can’t tell her handlers what’s exactly wrong. What the hell is in this thing and why do old people like my grandparents still think they and everyone in my family needs to get it?</p></p>

        <p>I haven’t tried. I told my parents it could kill them but they are mid 70’s and will take the chance. Sad but true. That said it’s not even available here.</p>
