    <strong>Sweden Corona Statistics tells the true story of covid 19</strong>
    <p><p>All

<p>I had a look at the published statistics over corona deaths from Socialstyrelsen (Swedish organ for social issues).</p>
<p>Sweden has no required masks and only 1 in 20 is wearing one. People are going to food shops normally, going by public transport, eating out and shopping. There are no restrictions except i think its not allowed to gather big groups anymore (but it's a new recommendation from just a month back or so).</p>
<p>The document is here (in Swedish): https://www.socialstyrelsen.se/globalassets/1-globalt/covid-19-statistik/statistik-over-antal-avlidna-i-covid-19/statistik-covid19-avlidna.xlsx</p>
<p>Summary below for everyone who doesn't speak Swedish.</p>
<p>We are about 10 million people in Sweden.</p>
<p>9211 people has died.
8381 people who died was 70+ years old (91%)
From the people who died, many had previous conditions :</p>
<p>Heart decease (4641)
High blood pressure (7272)
Diabetes (2573)
Lung decease (1376)
Number of people in above groups:</p>
<p>Not part of above groups (1358)
Part of 1 group (2420)
Part of 2 or more groups (5433)
So basically, people who died from covid 19 was 70+ and often had previous severe conditions.</p>
<p>NOTE: Only 90 people under the age of 50 has died in the entire country!!!</p>
<p>830 people under the age on 70.</p>
<p>This, in a country with almost no masks and hardly any restrictions.</p>
