<title>For people who believe we are "downplaying" COVID-19 and believe that authorities took all the proper steps during all of this I have one question for you. Why does so much fiction out there exist showing the governments becoming tyrannical during a pandemic? Are we wrong to question a real one?</title>

    <p><p>Three recent ones I can think of involving COVID mutating. Songbird, Safer at Home and COVID-21 Lethal Virus. That's not to mention the hundreds of other movies showing the government become tyrannical during a pandemic. Then you wonder why people question the actual event? Pssh. I did not even scratch the surface with this video but wanted to showcase this phenomena. It feels like gaslighting.</p>

<p>Tell me in what world you think a good premise for a pandemic movie would be one where 99.7% of the people don't die?</p>
<p>That makes  about as much sense as the gross over-reaction that we have seen around the world. An intentional over-reaction if you are paying attention.</p>
<p>We have the data now. They are still telling people to do completely illogical things.</p>
