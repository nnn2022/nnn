        <p>It says mask reduce number of new cases. Well first, it is ultra obvious that "number of cases" is a stat you can spin in any way. Second, recently someone on here posted something by the CDC that did a similar analysis and found only miniscule correlations between mandates and "spread rate". But again, "number of cases" is a fake fake fake stat, no matter for which side it seems to speak. Look at California - the most zealous maskers with most cases. It's because they like pushing their cases up. And then Florida with no cases after lifting everything, it's because they've aren't playing along anymore.</p>

        <p>There's a lot of junk in that article.   It refers to a hodge podge of studies done for various purposes.</p>
<p>Many are 'mathematical models' or 'reviews of other studies' which I don't put a lot of faith in.   The word 'assumption' is used a lot.</p>
<p>Some use correlation studies.   "Mask mandates were implemented and cases went down therefore masks work."   I can show places where masks were implemented and cases went way up too.</p>
<p>A key phrase in the article is "Evidence From Randomized Controlled Trials Remains Sparse."   In other words, there isn't a lot of actual evidence that masks function the way they expect in regards to preventing viral transmission.</p>

        <p>I am starting to see how Nazi Germany came about: science was completely corrupted and people were led to believe myths like Aryanism. The same thing is happening with a century's worth of science being turned on its head!</p>
<p>&rt;There is no evidence of serious harms from masks and face coverings...</p>
<p>We've known since 1919 that there ARE serious health issues that emanate from face masks and coverings during a pandemic:</p>
<p><a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.10.1.34">AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF THE EFFICACY OF GAUZE FACE MASKS | AJPH | Vol. 10 Issue 1 (aphapublications.org)</a></p>
<p>Here's where it really starts to go downhill, FAST:</p>
<p>\&rt;&rt;&rt;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 does not spread uniformly. Many infected persons do not infect anyone else, whereas a small proportion infect many—a phenomenon known as overdispersion (κ statistic) of the reproduction number (<a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/M20-6625#r27-M206625">27</a>). The κ statistic for COVID-19 has been estimated at 0.1 to 0.45 (<a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/M20-6625#r20-M206625">20</a>, <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/M20-6625#r21-M206625">21</a>), indicating higher dispersion than in, for example, pandemic influenza (where κ is closer to 1, indicating that infected persons all have similar infectivity) (<a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/M20-6625#r28-M206625">28</a>). In effect, overdispersion of this magnitude means that about 10% of infectious persons, so-called superspreaders, may be responsible for about 80% of secondary transmissions (<a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/M20-6625#r21-M206625">21</a>).</p>
<p>Item 21 is a referencing this article that creates a model to prove dispersion blah blah blah:</p>
<p><a href="https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/5-67/v3">Estimating the overdispersion in... | Wellcome Open Research</a></p>
<p>My first reaction was, "OK, Wellcome Trust is involved and this can't be sound science." (WT is the UK's version of BMGF.) I read the methodology and discovered the following issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>" We extracted the number of imported/local cases in the affected countries (<a href="https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/5-67/v3#T1">Table 1</a>) from the WHO situation report 38<a href="https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/5-67/v3#ref-10">10</a> published on 27 February 2020, which was the latest report of the number of imported/local cases in each country (as of the situation report 39, WHO no longer reports the number of cases stratified by the site of infection)." <strong>Translation: we used data from 27 Feb 2020 when the world's governments were in the dark, did not understand what was going on, did not know what to look for and how to react, but we promise that this data is sound.</strong></li>
<li>"... we defined imported cases as those whose likely site of infection is outside the reporting country and local cases as those whose likely site of infection is inside the reporting country. Those whose site of infection was under investigation were excluded from the analysis (Estonia had no case with a known site of infection and was excluded). In Egypt and Iran, no imported cases have been confirmed, which cause the likelihood value to be zero; data in these two countries were excluded." <strong>Translation: We, like the WHO, assumed that Iranian and Egyptian stats were accurate even though we know that Iran and Egypt are not in Wuhan. (Yes, they excluded the datasets but I am being pedantic.)</strong></li>
<li>" Assuming that the offspring distributions (distribution of the number of secondary transmissions) for COVID-19 cases are identically- and independently-distributed negative-binomial distributions, we constructed the likelihood of observing the reported number of imported/local cases (outbreak size) of COVID-19 for each country." <strong>Translation: There's just no way that we would have known the type of the distribution, so we assumed that they would be identically- and independently-distributed negative-binomial distributions.</strong></li>
<li><strong>"</strong> We used simulations to investigate potential bias caused by underreporting, one of the major limitations of the present study. Underreporting in some countries may be more frequent than others because of limited surveillance and/or testing capacity, causing heterogeneity in the number of cases that could have affected the estimated overdispersion. See <em>Extended data</em> (Supplementary materials)<a href="https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/5-67/v3#ref-16">16</a> for detailed methods. ...  Due to interventions targeting travellers (e.g. screening and quarantine), the risk of transmission from imported cases may be lower than that from local cases. As part of the sensitivity analysis in <em>Extended data</em>, we estimated <em>k</em> assuming that the reproduction number of imported cases is smaller than that of local cases." <strong>Translation: we are making a LOT of assumptions because we really don't know.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>I gave up and went to check the funding sources and guess who I found? BMGF and Wellcome Trust!</p>
<p>Back to the original article posted by the OP... There's an entire chapter entitled <strong><em>"Evidence From Randomized Controlled Trials Remains Sparse"</em></strong> which essentially shuts the debate on the matter because if your theory cannot be repeated as an RCT, it's just a well-funded flight of fancy.</p>
<p>The funniest part of the OP's article is when they give excuses as to WHY they cannot have an RCT with reasons including:</p>
<p>\&rt;&rt;&rt;" Second, given this existing evidence, trials in which some persons are asked not to wear a mask may be considered unethical because the criterion of equipoise is not met. Third, if the research question relates to mask wearing as source control, the optimum design (from a scientific perspective) would be to randomly assign entire communities in a large social experiment, which in the current context would likely be both unacceptable to some and impossible to orchestrate."</p>
<p><strong>Translation: there's no way to prove that we are right (or wrong) but trying to do so would give rise to ethical problems which include killing granny as you'd be asking people not to wear masks in the middle of a PaNdEmIc.  You just have to trust us.</strong> You really cannot make this up!!! This is post-2020 ScIeNz!</p>
<p>This is a killer:</p>
<p>\&rt;&rt;&rt;" Fifth, as the modeling studies have shown (<a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/M20-6625#r32-M206625%20r33-M206625%20r34-M206625%20r35-M206625%20r36-M206625%20r37-M206625%20r38-M206625">32–38</a>, <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/M20-6625#r48-M206625">48</a>), the incidence of new cases may be significantly reduced over time by a decrease in transmission rate, which did not reach statistical significance in the short term. "</p>
<p><strong>Translation: we can't prove anything that we have said - and you'd be a granny killer for trying to - but here are some really fancy models that we created to produce whatever our funders wanted them produce.</strong></p>

        <p>I think masks may lower the amount of virus one send out or gets initially, which may have some benefit, but does not prevent spread.</p>

        <p>Lol, if this is true then is it the mask that's protecting people or the extra measures they engage in because of the symbol? This essentially nullifies any observational studies about regions who implemented mask mandates (as if they weren't already flawed due to the fact that most places put in several measures, not just masks).....the same studies included in this narrative as proof of mask effectiveness.</p>
<p>When they say "masks work" do they mean as effective ppe, or as symbolic trigger?</p>
<p>&rt; 3 studies that showed that if a person is wearing a mask, protective behaviors seem to increase in those around them</p>
