    <strong>How did first notice something suspicious about this "pandemic"?</strong>
    <p><p>I first noticed when they suddenly changed from talking about a "deadly disease" to a black man killed  by police and acted like that was the most important thing ever. There were se many people without social distancing and masks protesting about a single black man getting killed during a "deadly pandemic" I thought COVID was over. Then they started talking about COVID again suddenly. And claim that these massive protests didn't spike the deaths.</p></p>

        <p>When they showed people dropping dead in the streets in China, overflowing hospitals and portable refrigerators for the dead in Italy, yet none of that happened here or anywhere else. Then, I believe it was NBC news tried to pass off one of those overflowing emergency rooms in Italy as footage from New York. That’s when I knew something was fucky with their story.</p>

        <p>I wonder how I missed those videos. They're easily to ecplain-those people are tired from working 30 hours overtime a week. This happens in Japan, too. People randomly collapse. Sometimes people die of overwork-karoshi.</p>

        <p>The protests were a big turning point for me. For three months before they happened, I was told lockdown was necessary to keep people from dying in the streets. Then I turn on the news to a mob of people looting a Target in Minneapolis and smashing windows in Atlanta. Some wore masks, but most didn't. And people said, "This is necessary."</p>
<p>After the protests, people said, "Outdoor gatherings don't spread covid! That's why there wasn't a spike!" But other outdoor events are still cancelled or heavily restricted. Why? "To stop the spread of course! Just stay the fuck home!"</p>

        <p>When they locked down businesses, an unprecedented move, for a virus that couldn't possibly be that deadly.</p>
<p>Think about it - we detected the "first" case of covid in the US in February or so. Theres absolutely no way that was truly the first case in the US, it's just the first that was tested positive. With Lunar New Year, holiday travel, normal travel, and people gathering in all kinds of crowds, the virus was circulating long before that, and people were not dropping dead everywhere.</p>
<p>So this disease was circulating full force for several months and no one noticed. Not only that, to lock things down and say it'll kill off a fairly infectious virus permanently, worldwide, is just pure hubris. Theoretically you could, but not practically without destroying economies and quality of life.</p>
<p>But ultimately what is most shocking is how influenced people are by fear.</p>

        <p>From the get go.  They've been hyping up every new virus that comes around for 20 years now.  SARS, Bird Flu, Swine Flu, MERS, Ebola, Zika...the way the media was talking at the outbreak of all these we should be extinct by now.  I figured it was more of the same.</p>
<p>This <em>is</em> without question a deadlier pandemic than any of those, but it's still not even <em>close</em> to deadly enough to merit everything we've been doing.</p>

        <p>I think the lack of nuances and equally dramatic headlines with pictures are the main problem here. Ebola was very deadly and a survival rate on 50%, so it's much worse than COVID19 - but the pictures and headlines in news looks too similar. COVID19 has a survival rate on ca. 99%.</p>

        <p>Yes, that’s true. Zika was crazy because it was in Brazil and we had the olympics there only a few weeks after the hype. From what I read, the birth defects were due to pesticides that are banned elsewhere in the world.</p>

        <p>The first "Wait... what? We're getting played!" was when American news media was caught more than once using photos of crowded Italian hospitals for New York City and claiming it was New York. Before that I'd suspected that the virus was milder than claimed and some of the data coming out of China and WHO was wrong, but I'd written up the American response to a mix of slight overreaction and doing the best they could with known incomplete and possibly inaccurate information. </p>
<p>TikTok dance videos, the complete 180 on restrictions when it came to certain riots, and beyond confirmed that a real but very small threat is highly exaggerated to the point of being a scam.</p>

        <p>I started out skeptical of the whole thing in January because only a few dozen people in China had died from it, yet you couldn't go a day without seeing every news organization out there screaming at the top of their lungs about it. I was tired of it before it really began, and by March 12 I was excited for something to finally happen with it. Lockdown was cool for the first week or two (work from home!), then it became old fast. I accepted it, believing it would be over soon. Yet every few days it kept being extended and extended. And here we are, about to enter an eighth month of fearmongering, doomers, virtue signaling, and authoritarianism.</p>
<p>By May I just wanted my life back. Seeing the lockdown protesters vilified for spreading COVID but seeing no controversy over the BLM/Antifa rioters made me kind of disillusioned with the mainstream left. I used to think of myself as a somewhat left-leaning person, but the riots really pushed me over the edge. Not a huge fan of all the identity politics either. Suddenly we're all expected to hate police officers even thought the vast majority are only protecting us from criminals. Certainly the rabid Reddit leftists only pushed me away from their cause, defending looters and rioters (spreading misinformation certainly doesn't help either, the 40% statistic is total and utter horseshit but that's a discussion for another time). I still lean left economically but I am almost at the point of becoming a conservative. God I fucking hate the average redditor. r/pics is utter shit (nonstop anti-Trump and pro-new-normal agenda posting), r/politics is even worse. Every default subreddit is fucking awful. I'm only hanging by a thread on this wretched platform because of the hobby subreddits and of course the lockdown skepticism subs.</p>

        <p>What exactly is the "mainstream left"? Or antifa, for that matter? And who is supposed to hate police officers? Why do you believe that mask wearing is a political issue rather than an individual susceptibility to media propaganda? My town is saturated with conservative right-wingers wearing masks while walking in public. Don't be that old guy shaking his fist at those darn kids on his lawn. And avoid Rupert Murdoch-owned entertainment posing as news. And have an amazing day.</p>

        <p>It sounds like you may live in a conservative area without regular antifa marches. These are not mischaracterizations by Murdoch's propaganda empire - I witnessed the following with my own eyes, not through a screen.</p>
<p>Who are antifa? Those who identify themselves as such, wave the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=antifascist+flag&amp;t=brave&amp;iar=images&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images">antifa flag</a>, dress in all-black and still march through my major city multiple times per week chanting "all cops are bastards", and "antifascistma".</p>
<p>One of their mottos is "bash the fash", meaning fascist. I personally witnessed adult antifa men bash an innocent 16 year old's face to blood because he was wearing clothes that identified him as a conservative. The teenager did nothing to provoke them, and those that attacked were in a group of hundreds dressed in black with antifa patches and flags.</p>
<p>Again, I witnessed these events with my own eyes, not on Murdoch's propaganda network.</p>
<p>"All cops are bastards" was once a fringe ideology, but has swayed the elected leaders in my major city to defund an already struggling police department.</p>
<p>The police chief, a black woman, resigned, claiming that the city is endangering black lives by defunding the police, many of whom are black officers. Not to mention the struggling black families who live in neighborhoods with gun violence - they have just lost their safety.</p>
<p>I don't think "all antifa are bastards" many march with good intentions and they also hold peaceful marches. Many are regular people who believe they're fighting against oppression. But the ideology has had consequences.</p>
<p>I hope that answered some of your questions. Note I'm not defending the "other side" i.e. Trump, just relaying my personal experiences in a major US city. My family in other major cities have similar experiences.</p>

        <p>King Cuomo sent infected patients from NYC to Albany. This is the most contagious and deadly disease ever, and you're putting old confused sick people on buses and shipping them 200 miles away out of the hotspot, to start the cycle of infection elsewhere? When they had hospital ships in the harbor and field hospitals set up in central park, they sent infected people to Albany. At the same time NYC was having its "deadliest hours", my area was flooded with folks fleeing. I'd never seen so many summer homes and camps opened in April. First, there was no attempt to stop this movement out of the City, which was supposedly nuclear with covid. If that was ground zero, then we should have contained it there, blown the bridges Legend style. But we didn't, which signaled that the government wasn't really taking this seriously. And then I witnessed ZERO spike in our area. All those folks streaming out of the hotzone and nothing happened here.   </p>

        <p>I don’t remember exactly, but its the crazy flip flopping in general: wear a mask to walk but sitting is ok in a restaurant. Grocery stores are ok, but only chains. You can buy milk, but not a roll of scotch tape. Closing forests, no hiking here, but here at this other forest, you can hike until 3pm. Close the bathrooms in the front of walmart, only to make everyone funnel into the back of the store bathrooms. Blocking off parking spots for social distancing. It just makes no sense.</p>

        <p>I've known it was bioterrorism from the first reports in the media, but wasn't sure whether it was real or a media-generated psy-op. Turns out it was a mixture of the two, which became apparent around mid-April or so as the scientific studies started coming out.</p>

        <p>I knew something was up when they were showing the incredibly disturbing scenes inside the Italian hospitals, along with the deluge of experts saying "People are saying this is like the flu - it's not." The Italian doctor went on to say that it lays "dormant" and then explodes with symptoms such as being unable to breathe, and people were dropping likes flies because the doctors were not around to turn on the ventilators.</p>
<p>My gut told me something was off, and I was right. It is nowhere near as deadly as they made out, not even close. It honestly felt like an apocalypse was occurring, shelves were empty, I remember seeing people faces just pure terror. I knew something was up when they were trying to force it so bad. The only question I didn't understand at the time was <em>Cui Bono?</em></p>
<p>Of course, the goal was destruction of the economy so they can impoverish us and maintain power. George Orwell in 1984 believed they would artificially destroy the productivity of capitalism through endless wars with Eastasia and Eurasia, in the end they destroyed it through a war on a virus. The world was far too equal under free market capitalism - even the most poor people had an incredibly high standard of living compared to even 200 years ago. They had to destroy it, to destroy the excess production somehow.</p>
<p>Get ready for poverty while the ones of the top dole out welfare to you, completely impoverished and freedoms gone.</p>

        <p>I saw a video posted on r/videos showing the "terrifying conditions" inside an Italian hospital ward.  </p>
<p>Bunch of people in rows of beds all hooked up to vents or having some kind of weird oxygen bag thing over their heads.... </p>
<p>Then it struck me. THEY'RE ALL OLD AND FAT.  There's just no good cause to go locking down the world to try and keep old fat people alive. They have a very short life expectancy already being both old (the biggest factor in one's mortality) and fat (the second biggest).</p>
<p>If you're 70 and obese, you've got less than 2 years, maybe 3 if we're being generous.  </p>
<p>I didn't fill these people with butter and sugar for 60 years so I really can't be surprised when they kick off. I'm certainly not going to up-end my life or advocate policies that will cause poor kids all around the world to starve to death to try and keep fat old westerners alive for another year or two.</p>

        <p>I was skeptical that the virus was <em>that</em> dangerous back in early March. I even joked conspiracies with my co-workers that it was created to sell more hand sanitizer... or to restrict air travel as fuel was running out.</p>
<p>I was very skeptical and saw through the fearmongering. I used to read JoeMyGod daily but then raised eyebrows when they ran an article stating that mass graves were being dug in NYC to bury people who died of COVID-19. I haven’t visited that site ever since, good riddance.</p>
<p>In April I awaited the videos of completely packed hospital wards and people collapsing in the streets in the UK. This never came. I pondered that this was a dangerous virus for vulnerable people but for healthy people it would just be comparable to the flu in most cases. I argued with people who mindlessly compared this to the Spanish flu - that the second wave would kill a considerable number of young healthy people. </p>
<p>I didn’t believe the claims that immunity would fade away after a few months and many people could get re-infected after catching it once. It seemed a little odd. At 10 I knew that antibodies would eventually fade after a while, but the immune system could find a way to produce more when required.</p>
<p>I have been skeptical for quite a while.</p>

        <p>Yep that was when I was really like had enough. The news cycle broke from covid to BLM protests (some of which rivaled the size of festivals) and not a chirp in the media about covid spread from these. Also the few thousand “experts” that time who affirmed it was okay to protest but you can’t go live a normal life.</p>

        <p>Viruses will always become weaker or kill quickly. There is little middle ground, at least after enough time.</p>
<p>The only reason they spread strongly is bioterrorism activating small pockets. No one would ever tell you if it was bioterrorism. They'd want you to carry on as normal. Except for the bioterrorists. They'd want you to lock down because their goal is to make you weaker and disrupt your way of life.</p>

        <p>When they started with the lockdowns. I was like, "Isn't that going to be unhealthy for poor people or people with mental illnesses/disabilities? What about women? They're gonna be the ones expected to watch over their kids during online schooling. And why do we even have online schooling? Some kids literally need schools as their only way to safety from poverty or abuse or even a consistent schedule."</p>

        <p>My skepticism started out at "hm it seems like it might actually not be as bad as we thought" when seeing the antibody studies from New York. I've been growing more and more skeptical with the BLM riots, learning that the average age of death is like 1 year younger than life expectancy otherwise, and after knowing someone who had it who basically said it was nothing.</p>

        <p>It was sorta a gradual thing for me. I followed Corona for a good while, a good bit before the media did. I noted that while it was seemingly rampaging Wuhan that it should've spread around the globe by that time. It had a 2 weeks incubation period which meant that outsiders who visited China should've gotten infected with it and spread it. I was a doomer back then so I had predicted that this virus would eventually pop up in America and hit the major cities pretty hard.</p>
<p>Suffice to say, that didn't exactly happen. I was waiting for it to happen within 2 weeks, no meme or anything. I kept on saying 2 weeks, but it just never seemed to get out of control anywhere else like it did in Wuhan, barring Italy of course. That was the 1st suspicious thing because I was weirded out how only Italy got hit hard and nowhere else did, and of course around that time, the media incited the hysteria, I was growing out of being a doomer after seeing things not adding up but still believing in mask mandates at least. Then Boris got infected with corona, "nearly died" but then miraculously came back as good as new??? I thought to myself, if he nearly died, wouldn't he be bedridden for a long time? But then when the BLM protests happened and we were being told that the protests didn't spread Corona, I snapped out of being a doomer and have since been vehemently against the lockdowns and the covid hysteria.</p>

        <p>mid-April, when all these dystopian stories were coming from the UK (an old couple getting confronted by policemen for sitting by themselves in the park and stuff like that), as well as discussions in different countries about immunity passports and mandatory vaccinations. The 1984 vibes never went away after that.</p>
