    <strong>What is Covid-19</strong>
    <p><p>*Edit 1: 20k subscribers to this, only like 5 likes to this post. So far the people who replied they all believe there is a new virus. They don't know much about it, if is man made or natural if is has been since long or just now. People believe that covid actually exist because at the end of the day they can't accept 5hat the scam could be as big as the virus actually be non existent.</p>
<p>About a year since this new normal started and is time do some reflexions.</p>
<p>By now we can compare excess deaths from the last 10 years and compare it with 2020, I haven't yet find numbers that support the main narrative in any country whatsoever, there's bene Sweden that didn't have lockdown and mask use and yet no excess compared with other years.</p>
<p>We've also saw a drop in all respiratorie illness during 2020 and whenever you hear symptoms that we had since we remember now is presented as Covid-19.</p>
<p>We've seen unreliable tests that lead to "cases*.</p>
<p>What my reasoning so far lead me to think that:</p>
<p>Covid-19 it doesn't exist at all, is a rebranding of the influenza, colds, pneumonia and other respiratorie illness, basically a scam based on statistics and fake tests.</p>
<p>I know that many people think that is a human made in lab virus, it doesn't doest it to me, I haven't seen anything that proves  there's anything new around.</p></p>

        <p>The question is more technical, I want to know if in this sub people think it actually exist. I know many people that know that there's fakery in the main narrative but they still think that the new virus deadly or not exist.</p>

        <p>So what you think Covid-19 is exactly technically speaking leaving the hysteria aside? </p>
<p>I get the China thing but numbers in a country like Sweden that pretty much had a neutral take in restrictions why they don't have any excess deaths compared with the last 10 years? They created a virus that don't kill?</p>
<p>Also what happened with flu, pneumonia etc? Just vanished this year magically?</p>

        <p>I mean Covid is likely to exist. I highly doubt covid is what’s spreading around and ‘killing’ people, supporting your outline of flu/pneumonia having vanished, but early this year there was a Chinese virologist whistleblower who identified ‘coronavirus’, identified its altered nature, and thus gives me a reason to apply some kind of validity to covid existing.</p>

        <p>Without a ridiculous amount of resources time and will to investigate it, I am inclined to believe it is a real virus just reeaaallllllllllllllyy not as bad as it is advertised in nearly every way, for the gross majority of people. </p>

        <p>COVID-19 exists but it's the disease, not the virus. The virus is SARS-CoV-2. The media fuses the two into 'Covid,' which can take the qualities of both and therefore be presented as a mysterious, unpredictable doomsday virus with limitless effects, even though the coronavirus family is well-understood (it includes SARS, MERS, and strains of common cold) and this one behaves normally.</p>

        <p>SARS-COV-2 is definitely a real virus that makes people sick. Is it as contagious or as deadly as we have been led to believe? Not at all. COVID-19 is the name for the symptoms that people get as a result of a SARS-COV-2 infection and these symptoms are very similar to the symptoms of other respiratory viruses, including other coronaviruses. Coronaviruses have existed for a long time and have always made people sick. Viruses also mutate all the time. Basically, an existing coronavirus probably mutated into SARS-COV-2 and for whatever reason it got tracked in an unprecedented way; resulting in people having more information than they knew what to do with, and thus panicking.</p>

        <p>not sure where it comes from. could have been around for a long time, in humans, just a mutation that didn't really cause illness; or maybe in a population that wasn't affected very severely, or maybe just not tracked and followed like it has been. could be a lot of things and we probably won't ever actually know.</p>

        <p>well, sorta? I'm not a virologist or epidemiologist so this is where I really have no idea but if it has been around but in more of a "common cold" form, we wouldn't have been testing for it because who gets a respiratory virus panel done when they have a cold? most won't even go to a doctor because they don't need to. so only when it either mutated enough or got into a genetically susceptible population did we start looking for it and thus found it. but like I said, I really have no idea at this point. I also don't know what happens if you run a virus panel and the person has a virus that it doesn't test for. there's no way we can know about every virus/bacteria in the world.</p>

        <p>That's not true. It is a real disease/virus. I know lots of people who have had it (mostly all really mild cases that didn't require hospitalization) and I have taken care of lots of people who have had it badly enough to be in the ICU, some even on lung bypass circuits. It is a respiratory virus but there are a few unique symptoms and the normal treatments don't seem to work as well or the same way so that indicates it's some we've not encountered before. I have also noticed (just in my limited experience) that it seems to affect certain racial groups more severely, unlike other things we have seen in the past. </p>
<p>I think that it is blown <em>way</em> out of proportion. I think some people in power saw something real they could use to accomplish goals and push agendas, took advantage of it and used fear mongering as a tactic.</p>

        <p>I think that mask wearing and social distancing have possibly reduced other illnesses. I <em>do not</em> think these are necessary measures but mask wearing does do something, as does staying away from other people. People in extremely high population density countries have been wearing masks on a regular basis for years. When sterile procedures are performed, a mask is required to prevent the exhalation of germs into the sterile field. As for distancing, people have been encouraged to stay home (from work, school, ect.) when ill for a very long time, in part to avoid getting others sick. Another possibility is that, as morbid as this is, a good portion of the population we usually see ill enough to be hospitalized (and thus tested) for flu and pneumonia have already died from COVID. Likely, the combination of these things as resulted in far fewer cases of the illnesses we usually see. As far as Sweden goes, as I said, the whole thing is blown out of proportion. Lockdowns are not necessary to control this virus; it is not as contagious or as deadly as we have been led to believe. Sweden is evidence of that. It is a virus that is acting like a virus.</p>

        <p>&lt; I think that mask wearing and social distancing have possibly reduced other illnesses. I do not think these are necessary measures but mask wearing does do something, as does staying away from other people.</p>
<p>In this case Sweden should have had all the covid cases, hospitalisations and deaths + all the influenza, pneumonia etc deaths, hospitalisations, and it's not showing in the numbers, it doesn't add up. </p>
<p>&lt;Lockdowns are not necessary to control this virus; it is not as contagious or as deadly as we have been led to believe. Sweden is evidence of that. It is a virus that is acting like a virus.</p>
<p>If is not as contagious and deadly, what are all the deaths and hospitalisations of countries that did lockdown? Why there's no significant change in numbers of deaths anywhere, either lockdown like most places or in places like there's no lockdown? </p>
<p>Im I missing something?</p>

        <p>there's a lot going on and a lot we don't know and my never know. saying it's not <em>as</em> contagious or deadly doesn't mean it's <em>not</em> contagious or deadly. thus there are still cases and deaths. I really don't know anything about Sweden. could be genetics, could be what people are doing on their own even though their gov't isn't requiring it, could be that they have a super high infection rate but few people develop COVID. Like i said, we may never know.</p>
<p>The problem is acting like a virus that has infected ~1% of the world's population and killed only 3%(max) of that 1% is an unprecedented, horrific problem that requires massive shut downs and all this other nonsense. One of my favorite things that has been said about it is "if it was a book no one would read it." A disease that kills .03% of the global population is just not that interesting.</p>

        <p>I appreciate your attempt to answer. However the math I'm using is very simple and Swedish people are humans and share same DNA at most, also you might be find interesting that Sweden is packed by refugees from several countries cities like malmo are some of the most diverse in the world in background. </p>
<p>If you don't know anything about Sweden perhaps is time to take a look into, because I speak with Swedish people every day and I'm about to move to live there. </p>
<p>I see attempt to justify the existence of the virus at any cost, while the very simple math is showing that's there's nothing new compared with the last 10 years.</p>
<p>When you ask a doomer about influenza and other illnesses + that they were actually less deaths than normal this year's in most countries they say is because masks and social distancing (like you said) but when you say that Sweden didn't have that any of that, there's basically nothing intelligent to say. </p>
<p>It would be great if you could share what makes you believe for sure that there's a new virus since 2019.</p>

        <p>well, I have said multiple times that it's likely been around much longer. you also seem to be ignoring my explanation that there are fewer flu/pneumonia cases and deaths because the people who typically contract and die from those diseases died prior to the typical flu season and that is playing a part. not sure why you need to think it's a fake virus. it can be a real thing and still be overblown, abused as a means of controlling people, and an excuse for people to wield power they shouldn't have.</p>

<p>How much longer would you say? Months? Years? Decades? Centuries?</p>
<p>&lt;you also seem to be ignoring my explanation that there are fewer flu/pneumonia cases and deaths because the people who typically contract and die from those diseases died prior to the typical flu season and that is playing a part.</p>
<p>This don't make clear sense, perhaps you could explain it better.  Always have in mind that Sweden also didn't have any of those cases and numbers or total deaths are coincidentally same usual.</p>
<p>&lt;it can be a real thing and still be overblown, abused as a means of controlling people, and an excuse for people to wield power they shouldn't have.</p>
<p>The way I see it and using simple math, yes is a real thing, is all the respiratorie diseases re-branded. And their oy proof is a PCR test, which is shown to be faulty, let alone that PCR is not a technology supposed to be to diagnose anything and if high cycles would test everyone and everything positive. </p>
<p>I'm still to hear simple evidence of the existence of new virus, if the virus is been for years around and it's not so harmul, then why to call it covid 19 in 2019?</p>
<p>Without being disrespectful to you, you either still haven't explained or I missed something, so far I'm in the same place as before, I don't think there's a new virus.</p>

        <p>I think it's a communication issue. elderly people and people who live in long term care facilities and people with comorbidities are the people who usually get severe enough flu cases to be hospitalized and die from it. that is the same population who died in large numbers earlier in the year. therefore, the populations vulnerable to the flu are much smaller, resulting in fewer deaths, balancing the numbers and in the end there are no or very few excess deaths. that's about all I have left, I don't think I can explain anything any further than that. hopefully it at least made you think of some other possibilities even if you don't change your mind.</p>

        <p>Ok now i understand your point, is better explained. however the math don't work. Even from the elderly there's no excess of deaths the only lace is Bergamo Italy and maybe Brescia during the first month of all this allegedly had a 500% deaths that can be attributed to bad protocols.</p>
<p>The math still don't work as far as I understand.</p>
