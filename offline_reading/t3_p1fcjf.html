        <p>From what I understand, they claim they can’t do vaccinated vs unvaccinated studies in children because it would be “unethical” to withhold treatment by putting the non vaccinated at risk. Which makes no sense whatsoever but also, the CDC had no issue withholding treatment during the Tuskegee Experiment they took on.</p>

        <p>Exactly it's such a bullshit argument. Let's extend it out to the future, though, just for a thought experiment.</p>
<p>CDC: It's unethical to do a placebo/saline study, looking at health outcomes of those who are unvaccinated vs. those who are vaccinated (for one particular vaccine or any and all vaccines or a combination of vaccines).  </p>
<p>2025, CDC: It's unethical to do safety studies PERIOD because this medication/drug/vaccine needs to be given to EVERYONE because we're in an EMERGENCY and if you don't take it you'll be taken to the 'red zone medical camps' as a high risk individual to protect the rest of the population.</p>
<p>Now everyone is stuck, forced to take boosters, or any and all medication the government wants you to take. Either you take the next pill, or drug, or vaccine, or you'll vAcCiNe pAsSpOrT is taken away and you can't buy groceries. Then perhaps the people who cheered for vaccine passports because 'they just make sense' will understand the mess they've gotten the world into. And the only ones they can blame is the person in the mirror.</p>

        <p>I mean I could see something like that happening. I was listening to a scientist talking about the booster jabs and how they won’t have to go through any safety studies. I’m wondering if that’s because they view this as an emergency and can push them through just like they did with the first round.</p>

        <p>Yeah i saw that. People were commenting and telling me that ‘the placebo group is just to test efficacy’ and i respond ‘how would they do long term safety studies then? No placebo or saline?’ And ofc no response. We NEED placebo studies for long term safety studies to compare health outcomes! Am i wrong in my logic or nah?</p>

        <p>And they gave unvaxed people in their trial groups the vax, effectively removing the control group of their trial. Very sus.</p>

        <p>This is the number one biggest, baddest, most classic anti-vaxx argument, and frankly there are no good rebuttals.</p>
<p>Some try to say it's unethical to withhold vaccines to perform this study, which is rubbish. Aside from being totally circular logic (presuming the product is too good not to use, therefore you can't test it to make sure it's good enough to use), you do not need to withhold anything from anyone - you can analyze the data on existing unvaccinated persons, for which there is no shortage.</p>
<p>The other common response is that studies of this nature have already been done and have not found anything, which is not true either. Most studies comparing a vaccinated group vs. an unvaccinated group only focus on one vaccine, usually MMR. Because of this, members of the "unvaccinated" group can be fully unvaccinated, fully vaccinated minus MMR, or anywhere in between. These types of studies predictably fail to find a substantial difference between the two groups, but they often do find a non-zero difference: the unvaccinated group usually does turn out to have slightly lower rates of various chronic conditions such as allergies, asthma, or autism. But because the study only focused on a single vaccine, the results are similar enough to be branded as "not statistically significant", and the media invariably reports it as yet another study that proves vaccines are harmless.</p>
<p>I also occasionally see someone point to a foreign study (German, I think it was) that purports to have compared fully vaxxed vs. fully unvaxxed children. There are three problems with this one. First is that vaccine schedules vary across countries, with some countries recommending fewer/different vaccines and/or recommending them at different times. If deleterious effects are cumulative or age-dependent, this matters a great deal. Second, the unvaxxed group was so tiny that you could not draw any meaningful conclusions from them. And third... This study STILL found (slightly) lower rates of chronic illness among the unvaccinated group.</p>
<p>A properly designed, thorough, large scale fully vaccinated vs. fully unvaccinated study could potentially destroy anti-vaxx arguments once and for all, if these products are truly harmless (or very close to it). The fact that the CDC refuses to even attempt it is very telling, as is the fact that so many "freelance journalists", "guest contributors", etc. have tripped over themselves writing highly suspect opinion pieces on why such a study should never be done because it would be a waste of time and money. Seriously - I've seen several articles like that.</p>
<p>One day this will all be common knowledge, just like the big tobacco shenanigans of 60-ish years ago. I just hope it doesn't take quite as long.</p>

        <p>I agree. Circular logic and complete garbage science. Its tobacco science. People always spout media talking points (and they have for years). Vaccines are safe and effective! How tf do you knoowww?? Its so dumb. They think people who are anti vaccine are just braindead. Like no. You guys just dont have the proper science to back it up. Hopefully one day ALL vaccine lies are exposed and how much junk science is in the whole vaccine issue.</p>
