    <strong>Holding a country hostage</strong>
    <p><p>So Pfizer just announced their 3rd round of shots "necessary for maximum protection" aka their first round of booster shots. Fauci mentioned something about the possibility of needing a booster shot back in March I believe, he estimated a twelve month wait time for this, and now we're seeing it's coming a whole lot sooner than that. 
According to some of the research I've done the mRNA vaccination (technically not a vaccination but the definition of the word was literally changed a few months back so I guess thats what we'll call them) during its animal trials in the 2010's always increased immunogens in the test subjects for sbort amount of time and then as the mRNA injection fatigued and loss effectiveness the animals were left immensely vulnerable to not only the disease they were "vaccinated" against but to all other pathogens especially an autoimmune lung disease. <a href="https://regenerativemc.com/thursday-4-8-2021-what-happened-in-the-animal-trials-for-mrna-vaccines/">here</a>Their natural immune system it seems had gone dormant in the interim it seems.. The studies showed that after the initial injection it was necessary then to regularly vaccinate (boost) the test subjects to maintain their health. 
Ok so with that knowledge where does my mind go? I'm not really convinced that the shots are actually effective but let's just say for the sake of argument that they are. The general populace is convinced that it is in their best interest to get the jab and good ol' Uncle Sam is even going to foot the bill, but now they need the booster shot to maintain this new immunity. Has the government promised to pay for the third round of vaccinations? What about the fourth next spring and again in the fall? These unfortunates have theoretically locked themselves into a compulsory annual/bi-annual vaccination regimen and I wouldn't be surprised if the $15/jab price given to the US government steadily increases. The pharmaceutical companies and the media will maintain that they are protecting them from novel variants but as ex-VP of Pfizer Mike Yeadon has noted, it would literally take a variant that is dissimilar by 50% to the original strain for a new vaccination to be warranted. The delta variant I believe is .3% dissimilar... <a href="https://covidcalltohumanity.org/2021/04/27/dr-mike-yeadon-there-is-zero-chance-of-new-variants-escaping-immunity/">here</a>
Fact may be that these poor people DO need the booster shot but not because of a variant strain of Corona but because of they don't take it their immunogens will plummet and whether or not they were jeopardized by the virus before they sure as shit will be then.
This theory ensures that not only do the pharmaceutical companies profit from this pandemic indefinitely but also it gives government the added bonus of medical fasistic control over its people. Want to quit your job? How are you going to afford the price inflated injection you need. You want to protest? You might be sacrificing your right to a vaccination by doing so. I'm there are 1000+ scenarios I'm not creative enough to come up with currently that could possibly come about from this type of control. The population might very well be held hostage by need of a perpetual government controlled "antidote". It's a classic villainous move and not necessarily original but logically effective. 
This is just a small slice of the bigger picture I'm sure I cannot fully see yet but it doesn't seem unlikely to me. Tell me what you think.</p>
<p>TLDR; bigpharma in conjunction with the federal government are entrapping the population in a "you are poisoned and I have the antidote" style hostage scenario in the rollout of obligatory vaccinations.</p></p>

        <p>Health passport could become a thing but this ^ scenario is one that wouldn't rely on vax papers to shut anyone down. In my mind the passport would be the mechanism used to levy and disenfranchise those resistant to being vaccinated.</p>

        <p>ADE, which is the effect you are referring to when you explain how the vaccine might cause wreaking of your general immune system after an initial boosting period, is not easily fixable with successive vaccinations either.</p>
<p>The way it works, if I am not mistaken, is that the vaccination basically hyper stimulate your immune system in responding to the specific spike protein. But if another virus or another variant comes along and bypasses that specific spike protein identification mechanism (likely over time), then your immune system is even less prepared than if you had a natural immunity to the virus (which actually rely on a more varied response to the virus than just focusing on one spike protein as instructed by the vaccine).</p>
<p>So either they create vaccines for any potential new influenza variant, etc... or they’re willingly or unwillingly sacrificing future immune responses in huge parts of the population to lessen a bit the COVID symptoms now.</p>

        <p>Any of yall listen to the "grand theft world" podcast? If you don't want to listen to 20 different podcast to get a alternative view on the covid narrative. I suggest listening to them. They play a lot of crucial parts to different podcast. Kinda like a good recap to a lot of information in one location.</p>
