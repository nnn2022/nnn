    <strong>Looking for people to share how the U.K. lockdown has effected them for a project</strong>
    <p><p>I’m doing a project to raise awareness of how the restrictions are effecting people. You can remain anonymous. I’m looking for people to explain how the lockdown has effected them mentally, financially, physically even- just whatever adverse effects have come from this for you personally. Please share your story in the comments if you want to be involved.</p>
<p>I’m turning the responses into posters &amp; stickers that I’ll eventually put up around the town and have other people print and put up wherever they are, they’ll also be on social media. </p>
<p>I’m pretty convinced a vast majority of people don’t actually realise the devastation this is causing for so many people.</p></p>

        <p>The outcome will be interesting!</p>
<p>For me I'm not normally a miserable so-and-so. However, since losing my autism group that I run (still do online but it's not the same), losing access to my hobby stalls/shops and not seeing friends for over a year (they live miles away) I'm feeling the mental toll.</p>
<p>Everything is a struggle with no immediate end in site. Now, I don't wanna be extreme and say I've contemplated suicide a few times, but when life pushes you back at every, single, moment.. it's understandable how me and thousands of others are feeling that way.</p>
<p>I'm a mild case of how it effects me. I have friends who are completely isolated with no transport. A friend who lost their job and isolated. Everyone is suffering more than how many this virus would have killed</p>

        <p>I’m really sorry you’re struggling so much :(, it’s completely understandable. They say they’re “protecting vulnerable people” but vulnerable people are the ones being harmed the most by the restrictions and measures</p>
