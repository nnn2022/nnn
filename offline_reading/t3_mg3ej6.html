    <strong>This sub is scaring away people new to this and want to learn more</strong>
    <p><p>I really want to get this off my chest and I hope it's okay to do it here and discuss. It's amazing to see that this place is gaining momentum. It makes me happy to see that people are starting to doubt where this is headed after a year of conflicting rules and laws, and to realize that it's okay to question the motives of our governments. But as this sub grows, it's become a place where people dump their frustrations and post controversial screenshots without sources. It's herding us into a narrative without providing resources for people to think for themselves and come up with their own conclusions. I know it's in retaliation towards people who criticize and silence us, but at the same time, it's giving this sub an infamous status, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p>It must feel good to unleash all this bottled up frustration. But shaming, attacking, and instigating paranoia makes us stoop to their level. It's scaring away those that want to know more but are too afraid to be affiliated to this sub. You can see it in the way people start with "I'm not a covid denier or an anti-vaxxer...". When people are ready to open their eyes but are hesitant, it would serve us well to guide them without scaring them off. </p>
<p>I don't mean to rag on anyone. Maybe there are other places that are moderately skeptical and I'm just in the wrong place. Maybe it would be helpful to post news articles screenshots accompanied by citation. Maybe it could be cool to pin some legitimate news articles and research at the top so new people can read through and understand the situation better. Or hey, maybe I could be dead wrong since the sub is growing, after all.</p></p>

        <p>I’m so tired of the instant gratification bullshit. If they’re genuinely curious about why we think the way we do than they can do the work and  read through the sub. I don’t come here to coddle or coax people into thinking like I do. I’m here to discuss ideas, discover instances of power overreach, and share my own experiences. I believe in free thinking and forming my own opinions. Im not going to violate my beliefs in order to bring someone to my “side.” They’ve gotta put in the legwork and form their own opinions.</p>

        <p>I never said anything about rights violation. I said I am not going to violate my own belief of free thinking by pushing my thoughts on others. If they want to come to this sub and they don’t like what they see, so be it. If they do, welcome aboard. I don’t need people to agree with me in order to validate my beliefs.</p>

        <p>You might find you prefer /r/lockdownskepticism. The mods there only allow "high quality" sources.</p>
<p>In my experience though people aren't swayed by data or reason. If they were, we never would have gotten in this mess in the first place. And from what I've observed outsiders seem to paint /r/nonewnormal and /r/lockdownskepticism with the same brush regardless.</p>

        <p>Yes--there is already a sub that is more along the lines of what OP describes, i.e. r/LockdownSkepticism. If a doomer peruses that sub for several hours and doesn't take away <em>anything</em>, then nothing written here will sway them either.</p>

        <p>Right. I've talked to doomers on that sub- there's fewer there than there are here but there are some. In my experience, they're no more amenable to anti lockdown ideas there than they are here.</p>

        <p>You're right. Maybe I'm still new to this and optimistic. I've had way more success having a productive conversation one on one with acquaintances. Most of them felt like something wasn't adding up but they never felt comfortable openly discussing it.</p>

        <p>You’re right. There’s a lot of feeling and emotion about what’s going on. The feeling and emotion of this sub compared to the feeling and emotion of people who have bought into the fear. It’s not their fault, it’s shoved down our throats everyday. There’s no honest news anymore, it’s all a narrative that needs to be pushed by the powers that be. </p>
<p>Which brings me to my next point: Weather you’re anti mask or like wearing 72 masks, we’re all heading towards the same place and the only way to stop is it make more people aware. </p>
<p>That will not be accomplished by baseless claims (you and I and the rest may know it’s true, but the people brand new to this won’t.) Thats why I like to make sure any messaging Im trying to get across comes with FACTS. Data, numbers, and proof.</p>

        <p>You're generalizing about the content of the biggest anti-lockdown sub on reddit, and I don't think that's fair. The bigger any group gets (and the less they censor people), the more likely you'll run into someone you disagree with or think is a jerk. That's true for groups about anything, even stuff like knitting. This group has done a great job of being welcoming to anyone who's anti "new normal" and not pushing only one ideology while censoring the rest.</p>
<p>You can go to r/lockdownskepticism for content moderated to favor scientific studies and mainstream news sources</p>
<p>r/lockdowncriticalleft for left wing takes on why lockdowns suck </p>
<p>r/lockdownMHsupport for support for the enormous mental health toll of lockdowns that doesn't force people to add an obligatory "of course I think lockdowns are necessary and I'm totally obeying them" or be castigated as murderers for expressing their loneliness</p>
<p>But this sub, in addition to being bigger and less specialist than the above, has the advantage of having been, from the beginning, not just about lockdowns but also about the dangers of vaccine passports etc. So there's a lot of value here. I've gotten into arguments with jerks here, but I'd rather get into those arguments than see the jerks censored out.</p>

        <p>You make a really good point. I've felt a more ugly and frustrated aggressive tone as we nearer towards 50k. I've been here since about 5k. I think some of the people who finally found us are at a point of anger they need to process here. It is sad as I don't like the hateful talk and bashing of others . We need to be directing that kind of energy at the perpetrators of this warfare not each other. We're directing our anger at the wrong people. The people who are still drinking the fluoride will come around however putting down others does not help anyone.</p>
