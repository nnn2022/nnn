        <p>Nothing we didn't know already re the PCR test, but the doomers want 'science'? Here it is:</p>
<p>"Conclusion quote: Review Report - Corman-Drosten et al., Eurosurveillance 2020 </p>
<p><em>In light of our re-examination of the test protocol to identify SARS-CoV-2 described in the Corman-Drosten paper we have identified concerning errors and inherent fallacies which render the SARS-CoV-2 PCR test useless.</em></p>
<p>The decision as to which test protocols are published and made widely available lies squarely in the hands of Eurosurveillance. A decision to recognise the errors apparent in the Corman-Drosten paper has the benefit to greatly minimise human cost and suffering going forward. </p>
<p>Is it not in the best interest of Eurosurveillance to retract this paper? Our conclusion is clear. </p>
<p>In the face of all the tremendous PCR-protocol design flaws and errors described here, we 
conclude: There is not much of a choice left in the framework of scientific integrity and responsibility"</p>
<p>Certainly not going to see THAT in the MSM...</p>

        <p>Here’s a peer-reviewed scientific paper saying that the crisis isn’t as bad as the numbers might suggest. Here’s another one saying that there’s no good evidence of asymptomatic transmission. Here’s a third saying there’s no good reason to wear a mask to the supermarket. </p>
<p>Why aren’t people thinking “oh good, we can relax restrictions, get people back into work and enjoy our lives again”? Why do people prefer to sweep it under the carpet, censor it as disinformation and go on insisting that Covid is worth being poor, hungry and isolated for? Cui bono?</p>
<p>It’s apt to make you wonder whether there’s some ulterior motive we’re not being told about isn’t it?</p>

        <p>The fact is that a lot of people are loving the "OMG, I can FINALLY work from home like I had been begging my boss to let me do for years now!"</p>
<p>They don't give a crap about the people who cannot work from home or whose businesses are shut down because of these lockdowns.</p>

        <p>Nor those not getting serious illnesses diagnosed/treated...the children who will go hungry as parents have no jobs...those suffering inside their homes from domestic violence...those driven to despair and suicide from the isolation...none of these seem to matter to them at all</p>
<p>They pretend to give a crap about trying (and failing) to shut down a virus that in almost a YEAR has only just managed - with the inflated figures at that - to kill 0.015% of the world population (and the <em>vast</em> majority of THOSE had reached and exceeded expected lifespan) - it is absolute lunacy</p>

        <p>Mass testing of people reporting no symptoms with the current PCR protocols is an environment ripe for false positives.  Declaring "cases" in the absence of a clinical diagnosis based on a single test is absurd. It's hard to fathom that this isn't intentional to drive ever increasing case counts.</p>

        <p>That is exactly what it's for...and with the variable number of cycles per test they can feasibly tweak the numbers up or down infinitesimally to suit their narrative</p>
<p>Here in the UK they no longer mention deaths it's 'cases' - increased testing = far more (false) positives</p>
<p>It's smoke and mirrors and they can keep this up as long as people keep acquiescing to it...</p>

        <p>I totally agree and that's what I find so frustrating about the whole thing...this blind acceptance even amongst many who deep down know 'something isn't right'</p>
<p>I honestly believe at this point if the TV Drs announced that amputating everyone's right foot would eradicate this, people would be lining up for the chop</p>
<p>You can present them with all the science you want - they are the 'wrong' scientists</p>
<p>Show them the tens of thousands of medical experts and Dr's questioning the official narrative and they totally disregard because the paid-up TV docs say something else 🤦🏻‍♀️</p>

        <p>The issue is also that we KNOW that people who had CoVid-19 shed viral material for up to 6 months after recovery. So anyone who goes near those people can appear to 'be positive' on the PCR tests when the RNA is coming from DEAD VIRAL MATERIAL!</p>
<p>Someone tried to tell me "Nuh-uh!" on Twitter about that and I referred him to an article in the Baltimore Sun where a doctor admitted that fact and he still tried to bluster about "Nuh-uh!"</p>

        <p>I do too, and yep I see where you are coming from and agree there are many pearls scattered throughout the whole paper that are easily missable (that's if people don't give up reading) but I wanted to post it because just those ten points and the conclusion are dynamite</p>
<p>I love reading and can get to grips with most of it but I appreciate some might not want to read it all...I don't know if you've seen Piece of Mindful blog? They have written several articles on the PCR Test, Kary Mullis, the fact that the virus hasn't even been <em>isolated</em> and doesn't meet Koch's Postulates for disease, terrain theory vs germ theory etc etc...easy to read and understand</p>
<p>Some of it might be a step too far for some (ie germ theory possibly being wrong) but it's definitely worth a look</p>
