    <strong>We should all be highly skeptical of any new theories surrounding COVID, including "vaccine shedding," magnets, and lab leaks. Nobody on this sub has the capability to prove them, and they serve as distractions from the real issues that we have strong evidence to support</strong>
    <p><p>Theories about "vaccine shedding," magnets, lab leaks, and other topics make for interesting "what-ifs," but are ultimately irrelevant. Maybe they are true, maybe they are not. It doesn't matter either way.</p>
<p>Some of these theories sound relatively plausible at first glance - it is not that far-fetched to assume that small quantities of spike protein might spread in the same way that the SARS-CoV-2 virus does, and it seems possible that the virus could have come from a lab given the mysterious circumstances surrounding the Wuhan Institute of Virology. </p>
<p>(I'm not going to get into the magnet one, though. If you don't see right through that, I don't know what to tell you.) </p>
<p>However, nobody that frequents this sub has the ability to prove the legitimacy of either of those theories. </p>
<p>As far as I'm aware, there are no resident biochemists, virologists, or James Bond-style secret agents around these parts that will be able to provide irrefutable evidence in support of either of those claims. </p>
<p>We must consider the implications of those theories being true. First, let's look at vaccine shedding. </p>
<p>Let's say that it exists, and the spike proteins are the absolute most-toxic substance known to man that do everything this theory states and more. </p>
<p>What are you going to do about it? </p>
<p>In most areas of the US, over half of the population is vaccinated. When you encounter a stranger, it is likelier that they will be vaccinated than not. </p>
<p>Are you going to start wearing a mask? Do you plan to stay at home and never go out in public? Will you be demanding that the vaccinated stay away from you? Are you going to ask the government to ban the vaccine and prevent others from choosing to get it? </p>
<p>If your answer is yes to any of those questions, congratulations, you have been played. You have now adopted the COVID cultist mindset. </p>
<p>We are against COVID measures because we see through them - they are an irrational response to an unsubstantiated threat, they foster animosity amongst the non-elite class, and they erode bodily autonomy and individual freedom. </p>
<p>The response I've seen to the vaccine shedding debacle makes the same mistakes. It calls for one to start living their life in fear. </p>
<p>If the powers that be wished to convert some of us to the COVID cultist side, this whole "vaccine shedding" theory would be their best chance to do so. </p>
<p>Some of the folks on this sub were so fearful of it being true that they began to act no different than the COVID cultists they mock. They could not see the irony of what they were doing. </p>
<p>If you wish to live freely, you have to come to terms with the fact that some level of risk is inevitable. This hypothetical vaccine shedding is unavoidable if you wish to participate in society. </p>
<p>Do not let your mind be clouded by fear. If the whole vaccine shedding thing is true, we are all screwed. None of us will be safe, and you may as well accept that. </p>
<p>If the SARS-CoV-2 virus was too small to be filtered out by a mask, the spike protein by definition is even less likely to be caught. A mask will do nothing. </p>
<p>The only way to truly have stayed away from COVID would have been to become a complete loner living outside of society, and this is no different. If you remain in society, you will be exposed to spike proteins if that theory turns out to be true. </p>
<p>For most people, it is not feasible to leave everything and live in the woods. You cannot live in fear of something that you cannot avoid. You should keep on living the exact same way you did prior to learning about the possibility of vaccine shedding. </p>
<p>Once one begins to think about everything, it becomes increasingly obvious that the whole "vaccine shedding" thing is a psy-op that serves two primary purposes. </p>
<p>First, it serves to make the anti-pandemic measure side look ridiculous. The media will come out and ridicule such belief, and the general public will increasingly view our side as deranged anti-science lunatics. </p>
<p>Folks on our side will take that negative media attention as evidence that the theory must be true, and those individuals will start living in a state of paranoia. </p>
<p>Second, as a result of this newfound fear, many of us will finally start adhering to pandemic measures. Sure, technically we're doing it for the "wrong reason," but compliance is compliance. </p>
<p>If there ever were to be a COVID-related psy-op, this would be it. The elites kill two birds with one stone and return the wayward ones to the flock of compliant citizens. </p>
<p>Next, the lab leak theory. Once again, let's say that it turns out to be 100% true. </p>
<p>What are you going to do about it? </p>
<p>If the disease was weaponized and intentionally released, you have already been exposed. It is too late to hide. You will eventually be suffering whatever consequences come as a result of infection. </p>
<p>If it were an accidental escape that was covered up by the CCP, does it really make a difference? You were exposed, and likely have contracted it at some point if you've been living normally. The damage from the disease has been done. </p>
<p>In any regard, there is nothing you can do about it. You cannot hide from the disease, and you cannot personally do anything to China. </p>
<p>If it were an accident, the US might demand that China pay damages for the destruction to our economy, but they will refuse to do so and we have no way to collect besides claiming it by force. </p>
<p>If it were intentional, it would likely constitute an act of war. For obvious reasons, this would be an awful scenario where only the elite class would benefit. </p>
<p>China is too powerful and aggressive to bully around. Over the past few years, they have caught up to the West or even surpassed us in many regards. </p>
<p>They have nearly unlimited manpower, an outsized influence in the manufacturing of essential goods, and a "wolf-warrior" mindset that we simply don't possess. </p>
<p>There is no war with China that could ever remedy what happened as a result of the pandemic response. There will be no winners amongst the non-elite class that will be put in harm's way for an exercise in futility. </p>
<p>We should be very skeptical before buying into the lab leak hypothesis. The parallels to the "WMDs" that constituted the casus belli for the Iraq War are striking. </p>
<p>There will never be solid proof of the lab leak for obvious reasons, just as there was never solid proof of WMDs in Iraq. </p>
<p>We are being taught to hate and fear the Chinese when our own government is the one currently infringing on our rights. </p>
<p>The same thing happened around the beginning of the War on Terror - we were taught to hate and fear Muslims when our own government was the one responsible for harming us. </p>
<p>I abhor pretty much everything about the CCP, but they are not the ones that are currently stripping our bodily autonomy and freedoms away. Our own governments are. For many, this is a hard pill to swallow. </p>
<p>The Chinese are not the ones passing mask mandates, shuttering small business, and forcing experimental vaccination in the US. </p>
<p>While they may be working behind the scenes to ensure that those things happen, our own elected officials and justice system are the ones actively enforcing that tyranny here at home. </p>
<p>By promoting the lab leak theory, the American elites are doing an excellent job of consolidating power. </p>
<p>Mainly, they are deflecting blame for the authoritarian policies that they have promoted over the past year and half. They know that many people are strongly opposed to those measures, even if they are compliant. </p>
<p>Blame it on China, and nobody questions what is happening here. </p>
<p>China is the complete opposite of America in many regards - they don't look like most of us, they don't speak an Indo-European language similar to ours, they live halfway across the world, and they have cultures that are rather alien to most Americans. </p>
<p>That "other-ness" makes them a perfect scapegoat. Blame all the problems on highly-foreign China that many Americans are already suspicious of, and the elites here have carte blanche to do whatever they please. </p>
<p>They did the same thing during the War on Terror. Muslims in the Middle East fit every category I described two paragraphs above, and that "other-ness" made many Americans automatically fear that group despite there being next to no reason to do so. </p>
<p>While the general public was living scared of the specter of radical Islamic terrorism that never manifested in the US post 9/11, the government pushed through massive restrictions on autonomy and individual rights and greatly expanded the military. </p>
<p>We now have the Patriot Act, the TSA, NSA spying, and other horrible infringements on our natural rights as a result of this fearmongering. It worked before, and they're doing it again now. </p>
<p>The elites want the public to support pandemic measures that remove autonomy and increase the power of the government, and what better way to do so than to foster fear of a foreign bioweapon? </p>
<p>People will literally be begging the government for protection if they show "proof" that the virus came from a lab. Don't believe me? Look back at what happened post 9/11 when there was fear of anthrax or other terrorist attacks. </p>
<p>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_anthrax_attacks#Aftermath </p>
<p>Read what happened here, especially under the subsection regarding "Political Effects." </p>
<p>The fear of anthrax (or other diseases) being weaponized increased support for war, led to billions of dollars of funding for the NIAID and other vaccine researchers/producers, and likely was a key factor in the passing of the Patriot Act. </p>
<p>As I've said, there are a number of very compelling reasons as to why the powers that be would wish to further the lab leak theory. Primarily, they have to do with inducing fear. </p>
<p>There is literally no reason to be afraid of this. Regardless of where the virus came from, if you've been living normally, you've already come into contact with it. </p>
<p>At the end of the day, you should live your life the same regardless of where the virus originated. </p>
<p>In the case of both of those theories, your course of action should be the same - change nothing, don't live in fear, and think logically about the situation. </p>
<p>Do not let these unprovable theories distract you from the real issues with irrefutable evidence that are currently affecting each and every one of us. </p>
<p>The consolidation of wealth and power, the erosion of bodily autonomy/individual freedom, the mental manipulation of the masses, the "othering" of the pro-autonomy out-group, and the impending artificial scarcities are real and provable. </p>
<p>Read my post history - I have written in detail about nearly all of those issues, and I have tried my best to provide compelling evidence from credible sources. If you would like me to delve into one of them more, I am open to suggestions (I plan to cover artificial scarcity soon.) </p>
<p>Those are not "conspiracy theories" - they are trends supported by facts. Those are the pressing issues we need to focus on. </p>
<p>Worrying about spike proteins, lab leaks, magnets, or anything else is a waste of your time. Do not buy into the psy-ops. Don't let yourself get played. </p>
<p>Keep a level head, and question everything. Be better than the COVID cultists who blindly believe whatever they are told. </p>
<p>Become a student of history, and learn to follow the trends and see where we are going. We are going down a dark path, and you should do your best to prepare for the coming storm.</p></p>

        <p>Absolutely. I don't think such speech should be suppressed, but we need to be very careful about what we buy into.</p>
<p>We shouldn't worry too much about the details of what is going on right now. The only things that are important are the long-term trends regarding consolidation of power and erosion of individual rights.</p>
<p>And you're right - the 5G and magnetism theories absolutely ruin any credibility we might have. </p>
<p>There are people who post on here that have brilliant views on what is happening, and unfortunately they are lumped in with people who put absolutely zero effort into developing their beliefs.</p>

        <p>Screw the vaccine. I'm not getting it, and I would advise anyone with a brain to not get it either. </p>
<p>Look at the long-term trends instead of sensationalist theories regarding the pandemic and the response to it.</p>
<p>If your main concern about the vaccine is that it contains a spike protein that may or may not harm you instead of the fact that it is being made mandatory and your bodily autonomy is being stolen from you, you have missed the forest for the trees.</p>

        <p>Dude the amount evidence for the Mass Sterilization theory is plenty. This theory is realistic and grounded in reality. You can shut down every other theory, but mass sterilization is here to stay. Way too much evidence in the foot prints of Bill Gates/Anthony Fauci.</p>
<p>Edit: if you want links I overdosed on those. Mass Sterilization is the simplest and closest theory to the TRUTH. Plausible logistically and has been done before (Africa/India vaccine sterilizations).</p>

        <p>I appreciate this post and I think it is important that we all try to think critically about everything. </p>
<p>Regarding the spike protein shedding, I agree that if the vaccinated are shedding spike proteins, this is something we will have to live with now. It will be out there in the environment. But we don't know enough about it to know with certainty the details of how the spike protein is shed, for how long, and whether and to what degree the "spike protein load" makes a difference. We also need to know more about the ways and to what extent spike proteins can impact people.</p>
<p>So many groups I am in on social media have women discussing how, despite being unvaccinated, they are seeing disturbances in their menstrual cycles. I feel this is worth knowing more about. And because of people at the bottom beginning to talk about it and raise questions, scientists are now looking into it. So I do think it's important to raise these questions in order to find out information. I remember seeing something within the last few months about scientists understanding that spike proteins were excreted in urine. They were able to verify that. So there is some proven excretion of spike proteins happening among the vaccinated. But we need to know more information. </p>
<p>As far as whether the unvaccinated should try to avoid the vaccinated, it may be a simple matter of avoiding close contact with vaccinated for a week or two afterward to mitigate the likelihood of the most severe ill effects. Or maybe to take some sort of prophylactic treatment if you have to be in close contact with vaccinated people. Again, without more information, we don't know. That's why raising questions and trying to find out more is important. I think this can be done without people freaking out and hiding in a bunker for the rest of their lives. But maybe it does bear reminding people to not freak out and hide in bunkers for the rest of their lives lol.</p>
<p>As for the lab leak, I am someone who was dismayed at the fact that the world was going through all of this without seeming to have enough curiosity about how we got in this position to begin with. So I am curious to find out how this all happened. </p>
<p>I definitely agree with the idea that the slide into a more authoritarian culture is as important if not more important then the health concerns about the virus or the vaccines, and we should be wary and proceed with caution here. And I like your points about not letting our own governments off the hook about the misery they inflicted upon us this past year. </p>
<p>I think it's a fair question to ask: what would we do with the information if it was proven that the virus was leaked from a lab? I don't have the answers to that. I agree with your points about war with China being unproductive, benefiting the elite only. I tend to be fairly anti-war except in the most extreme circumstances for the reasons you listed. </p>
<p>At the same time, it feels wrong to not find out how this happened and try to address it in some way. Maybe more increased international oversight into China's biolabs? I don't feel knowledgeable enough to really speak on possible solutions, but maybe there is something that doesn't involve war, and that could actually benefit everyone going forward.</p>

        <p>Without a doubt, these theories could be true. Likely, they have some merit. </p>
<p>I believe it is entirely possible that the virus came from a lab, and I could definitely see how a spike protein could be spread like the virus. They are not implausible theories, and they merit further research.</p>
<p>I've heard stories about the menstrual irregularities from the women I know. Something is fishy there for sure. I'm not denying that.</p>
<p>However, it does beg the question "what can be done about it?" </p>
<p>The answer is pretty much nothing. Besides refusing vaccination (which is the only rational choice) there is next to nothing any of us can do about this current situation. </p>
<p>If you go out into public, the risk is there. The only real way to avoid something like that would be to become a hermit, and I doubt many people want to do that (and even fewer are capable.)</p>
<p>I would definitely like to see something done about China's nonchalance towards pretty much every manner of evil. </p>
<p>They are actively genociding the Uyghurs, they are the main obstacle in the way of world peace, and they are becoming increasingly authoritarian and are exporting their evil to other countries.</p>
<p>At best, we could hope to boycott them entirely and convince the EU to do so as well. We could refuse to do business with China until they stop being so damn evil.</p>
<p>The question to be asked is "would such an embargo really hurt them as much as it would hurt us?"</p>
<p>China is no longer a nation of sweatshop workers who have no education and no money. They have a budding middle class that has enough in the bank to participate in consumerism, and they have diversified their economy quite substantially.</p>
<p>They are nowhere near as dependent on the US and European markets as they were even a few years ago, and it is possible that they have enough people and resources to focus on building a domestic market that would negate the need for foreign commerce.</p>
<p>Combine this with their current colonizing of resource-rich Africa, and our ability to effectively wage a "cold war" with China becomes quite uncertain.</p>
<p>If we boycott them, prices on American consumer goods would go through the roof. We also would have massive shortages of many products that would take years to fix. In some cases, those products may never be available here again.</p>
<p>Many businesses might simply cease operations, and others that remain open might view such an embargo as a temporary condition that doesn't merit the expense of bringing industry back home.</p>
<p>If such an embargo were to occur, it would need to happen sooner rather than later. Every day, China becomes less and less influenced by the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Even if it were announced today, however, it would not have the desired effect of making the CCP think twice about behaving in an evil manner.</p>
<p>Mostly, the non-elite class here at home would suffer as the cheap products we depend on to survive would become prohibitively expensive or unavailable. </p>
<p>There is no good solution to the China issue. Realistically, the only response we can give in that situation is "go on with our lives." </p>
<p>This whole thing sucks.</p>

        <p>I think we don't know that nothing can be done about spike protein shedding without understanding the nature of the problem more completely. This is why unbiased science is important. We have to first acknowledge that the vaccines could be causing a problem in order to solve the problems that they are causing, and it's hard because this flies in the face of the narrative that vaccines are 100% safe.. Still, I think it's jumping to conclusions to say that nothing can be done. It's just still too early. I think we still don't even know enough about the severity of the shedding, the problems the shedding causes, and the long-term and short-term effects and severity of such, etc. There very well may not be sufficient will in the scientific community to tackle this, though, which would be unfortunate.</p>
<p>I agree with all your points about China. They have been in continue to be so frustrating. And it does suck.</p>

        <p>I agree wholeheartedly with everything you said here but I think you should at the very least possibly open your mind a bit on the magnet issue. I agree when you say not to get bogged down in such things and there are definitely bigger fish to fry and the big picture is way more important place to focus.</p>
<p>I have personally stuck a magnet to my dads arm. It worked. Didn’t stick anywhere else on the arm or any other place on the body. I’ve heard theories about oily skin, stickiness from bandaids and a bunch of other explanations which don’t really account for what I experienced. </p>
<p>I want to be completely clear here, I’m not jumping to conclusions, I don’t think he’s microchipped or anything like that. I’m just reporting what I experienced and have come to no conclusions on what’s going on. I am also well aware that there could be some simple explanation for what happened that I could of easily overlooked. Just don’t know exactly what that would be, but it’s a very real possibility.</p>
<p>I am also not expecting anybody to believe me, like all these issues you mentioned I recommend being very highly skeptical and reach your own truths. </p>
<p>My original reaction was that it was fake and I was in the same mindset you are in. I’m certainly not saying that it is the wrong answer, like I said above I could have overlooked something and my perspective could very well be wrong but that’s where I’m at. </p>
<p>But in the overall I’m not worried about it or hung up on it but closing your mind to ideas can be just as detrimental as having it too open. </p>
<p>I’m well aware of discrediting techniques and I am also aware that this totally smells like one. I’m definitely not ruling out that possibility one bit.</p>
<p>Just wanted to leave my experience, take it or leave it I’m not here to try and change anybody’s mind, it just is what it is.</p>
<p>All in all I share your perspective on all this stuff, I will check out your other posts for sure and anxiously await your thought on artificial scarcity.</p>

        <p>Thank you. I’m so tired of people saying some thing is garbage when you’ve seen it with your own eyes. My issue with this is a magnet stuck to my arm after first vaccine dose right at the injection site. No not a spoon or a huge magnet, it was a small circular one. Move it to the left or right of the immediate area and it fell to the ground. So my issue with all of you people saying that it’s not true is that it actually is true, happened to me and I have a video of it. Obviously I and many other people are concerned and looking for answers other than to not believe something happened that you actually physically experienced.</p>

        <p>I’ll comment on the shedding (and I have been IRL and also here Reddit). I was a Reddit lurker for many years and what brought me out of the shadows was getting sick from a vaxxed person. I felt a need to share my story. It set me on an intense spin of reading and rabbit-holing since it’s considered a conspiracy theory but it’s hard to deny when it happened directly to you. Not like I believed the mainstream narrative of Covid beforehand but this event was a pivotal point in my understanding of what’s going on...if nothing in the “science and research” indicates what happened to me is real...what other “non-realities” are there to uncover?</p>
<p>I’ll concede that there may be another explanation that I’m unaware of. However, from doing loads of reading about other people’s stories and the alleged phenomenon of spike protein transmission (as opposed to the term “shedding”), I’m pretty damn convinced that that’s what happened to me. I live rurally and am fairly isolated on a farm with a small crew. Everyone got jabbed except me. I shared space with my mentor who was having a reaction from his shot, and right as he was getting well, I got “sick” for 24 hrs. The duration and type of symptoms reminded me of a vaccine reaction I had 2 years ago. Why, just this morning I had a zoom meeting with my cycle charting teacher (I chart my menstrual cycles, including taking my temperature every morning). As she was looking over my chart from May she saw the fever reading and asked, “did you get the vaccine here?” I said, no, but I was in close contact with people who did.</p>
<p>It’s good to be skeptical. I was, too, about Covid vax “shedding” until my experience directed me otherwise. Maybe the thing to be concerned about here, for the unvaxxed, is sharing close space with the recently vaxxed, maybe for a few weeks post-shot. Especially if they’re having a reaction to it...they might be breathing out, sweating, peeing, pooping spike proteins. Who knows what all this this will yield in the long term.</p>

        <p>My issue with this is a magnet stuck to my arm after first vaccine dose right at the injection site. No not a spoon or a huge magnet, it was a small circular one. Move it to the left or right of the immediate area and it fell to the ground. So my issue with all of you people saying that it’s not true is that it actually is true, happened to me and I have a video of it. Obviously I and many other people are concerned and looking for answers other than to not believe something happened that you actually physically experienced.</p>

        <p>Welp, my mom got the vaccine and a magnet stuck to her arm.
Idk how to post a video/photo here... but I have no reason to make that shit up. It was real and fucking mind blowing. Also, if you google vaccine shedding with your cache set to 2018 and prior.. youll take note of lots of info surroung the shedding of vaccines. Its also something that was taught in my school.</p>

        <p>I didn't read your whole wall of text, just wanted to say that the magnet thing is real. Tried it myself with safety pins, needles and magnets on a neighbour who has been vaccinated and all of the metal stuff stuck to her arm. Could feel it getting pulled to her skin a few mm before touching. I was as sceptical as you about this thing, but first I figured that many videos can't be fake and now I have seen it with my own eyes live.</p>

        <p>It was not sweat. The skin was dried just before and me while putting it on her arm as well as her could feel the magnetic attraction. If you don't believe me, try to make a safety pin stay attached to your arm. It's too heavy for sweat to cause this.</p>
