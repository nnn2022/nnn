    <strong>The mind control of what is deemed to be "politically correct"</strong>
    <p><p>Political correctness is communist propaganda writ small. In my study of communist societies, I came to the conclusion that the purpose of communist propaganda was not to persuade or convince, not to inform, but to humiliate; and therefore, the less it corresponded to reality the better. When people are forced to remain silent when they are being told the most obvious lies, or even worse when they are forced to repeat the lies themselves, they lose once and for all their sense of probity. To assent to obvious lies is in some small way to become evil oneself. One's standing to resist anything is thus eroded, and even destroyed. A society of emasculated liars is easy to control. I think if you examine political correctness, it has the same effect and is intended to.</p>

        <p>I'm increasingly of the opinion that the only way to get at the heart of what's going on is to talk about it in moral/religious terminology. "Science" is not adequate and has clearly been corrupted for evil purposes anyway long ago.</p>

        <p>After the dark forces break the ability of the masses to ascertain which way is actually up, they can be convinced that the new "up" is what was formally known as "down"</p>
<p>Or what is experimental and ineffective to be "safe and effective"</p>
<p>Or that life has "never been better" after being reduced to abject slavery</p>
