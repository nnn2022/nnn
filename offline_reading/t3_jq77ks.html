    <strong>What's Our Path Going Forward?</strong>
    <p><p>As someone naturally skeptical of any "mainstream" viewpoints, I suppose I was almost destined to end up here. That said, I have not been a conspiracy nut during this pandemic, and I've mostly played by the rules. I wear a mask indoors or if someone asks me to, I followed the first quarantine pretty well, etc. That said, I am past my breaking point.</p>
<p>The massive, media-approved BLM protests were the final bit of evidence to me that this is a partisan issue. The new Biden protests, praise for people standing in huge lines to vote, and general positivity about the shutdown ending only cemented my view. That said, what do we rational people do, going forward? </p>
<p>I've seen younger cousins of mine (in middle and high school) suffer heavily, the local high school has the highest rate of Fs ever. I've seen local restaurants that I love go out of business, I've seen small shops I've known my whole life shut down. Elderly small business owners are reduced to handing out flyers in the hot sun to try and get any customers. Fuck, I have an older relative who hasn't seen any of her family in person in months, and it breaks my heart to hear her on the phone. She is terrified, constantly.</p>
<p>My life is mostly fine, my college isn't too bad and my social life has returned somewhat, but I see casualties everywhere.  Unemployment is higher, depression is rising, and the air carries a constant tension. It sucks, seriously, and while I am doing alright, most people aren't. The thing that truly stresses me out is the fact that we, the people, have no say in this and no real voice.</p>
<p>How do we end this nonsense? I want to visit family again, have weddings, live a normal life. I want small business to survive and people to feel happy again. I want kids to have friends at school and music to come back. Instead, it seems like any positivity is vilified. I got shit from people I love, close friends I've had for years, for going to a party. I've seen worse happen to other people for less.</p>
<p>Sorry for the rambling, but is there anything we can do to return to an actual normal, or is the situation entirely in the hands of massive corporations and soulless political hacks?</p></p>

        <p>There's nothing that can be done about the damage already caused. What you should do is look forward to 2021. This is about to end now that Biden was elected. He will probably do one more lockdown then this will be over. 2021 is going to be a great year.</p>

        <p>Did you see Biden's Covid plans? They want nationwide mask mandates, etc - I thought Biden's election would make it end.</p>
<p>What planet are you on? A great year? Over and over? Are you a shill? A bot? What about those who have lost their livelihoods, businesses, homes, children dead from suicide, parents dead from suicide or isolation, missed medical treatment and care, dead from other problems? All the people starving to death in the third world? How great for them!</p>

        <p>Every time I see someone mention Biden's plan, I'm skeptical. Shouldn't we all be skeptical? Trump promised a Wall, Obama promised the Gitmo closure, Bush the first promised no new taxes. Politicians break their promises all the time and it usually turns out their most ambitious ones are the first to fail. With 2 branches of government stacked against him, I don't know how he could reasonably pull it off without diktats or massive backlash.</p>

<p>Yes because a sick person leads a nation. A year with great health troubles that's what 2021 is going to be.</p>
