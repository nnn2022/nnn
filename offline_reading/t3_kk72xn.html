    <strong>People who visit you with face diapers on.</strong>
    <p><p>It is so stupid on so many levels. Even most maskers know that face diapers don't actually protect you from anything, since we've all heard their "It's not to protect me, it's to protect you" speech a million times. And guess what! I never asked for anyone to "protect me." I can't believe how easily people were taught to act so paranoid, not just around others, but also of themselves. "Oh no! I might be sick and not know it, so I better protect my friend from myself, I don't want to kill her!" Despite asymptomatic spread being excruciatingly rare. It's sad not just how people have been taught to fear their fellow man, but also to think so lowly of themselves. "I might be a danger to people and if I don't 'protect them' I'm the lowest of the low!" Also, they think it "respects others"? It's DISrespectful. It's either saying "I'm too scared of you so I have to 'protect myself'" which weaponizes unmuzzled people, or it's saying "I'm scared I might hurt you if I don't dehumanize myself." which weaponizes the individual and I can't stand my friends thinking that about themselves. That they think they're a bad person if they don't go out of their way to "protect me." They're being taught to be a doormat to everyone, even their friends. Furthermore, it takes away the actual human aspect of visiting someone. If you are so afraid of me or so afraid of "hurting me" why bother even come to see me if you're going to be such a snowflake about it? </p>
<p>Another thing that makes me tick is the "immunocompromised" people. I get that they're more "at risk" of this, but they are more at risk to basically every other illness, and very few people like that wear face diapers during flu season, and we never go out of our way for them. "Oh, but this spreads easier and is worse than the flu!" Yes, it spreads, you can't live paranoid about it and no, it's basically a bad flu. "But people die!" Yes, and people die of the flu. </p>
<p>If you want to visit me, but you want to have a face diaper just to do it or do antisocial distancing, why even bother? It goes against everything that makes us human and I'm not going to apologize for the fact that  (1) I'm not okay with it and will never be and (2) sacrificing that for the paranoia and supposed "safety" of others is just insanity. If you can't even act like a real human around your closest friends, even if you're (or they are) "immunocompromised" as they say, then are you even human at all anymore?</p></p>

        <p>You are speaking my mind. The WHO even admitted themselves that asymptomatic spread is very rare. If people are sick, they should stay in bed. The rest of us should carry on with their lives. An Italian study from Bozen showed that masks are harmful due to elevated CO2-levels.  A Danish study showed that masks are ineffective. But they can have a huge negative impact on one‘s mental health. You don‘t see people smiling anymore, we are all dehumanized. I wish they would make it voluntary, so people who don‘t want to wear it can take it off without repercussions</p>

        <p>I'm not sure rare is the right word anymore.  A study out of wu-flu Wuhan of 10 million people didn't find a single case of asymptomatic transmission.</p>

        <p>I personally believe it is impossible too. Asymptomatic to me means healthy. Telling healthy people they could carry a deadly virus is just dumb. Do you have that study handy? I need countermaterials for my doomer “friends” :))</p>

        <p>Thank you! What’s funny/remarkable is that the article mentions the first case in Italy was from September 2019! That virus must be really deadly if we only notice it exists in March 2020. So what happened in that half year? Why is nobody questioning this?</p>

        <p>The worst part is that even after reading this you know it's not going back to normal anytime soon. The mask mandates being pulled are almost never mentioned because it's so far out in the future - if ever. Who would've thought that we'd grow up in a world where  we could say "Remember when you used to be able to see peoples faces in a store?".</p>

        <p>I unfortunately am doing the same with a friend. I feel horrible about it, but I honestly just can't bring myself to talk to her since it always devolves into arguments about this and her laughing at me and calling me a conspiracy theorist, and talking to me like I'm an idiot. And I guess it's also because I've lost a ton of respect for her. I just don't have the desire to speak to her anymore  and I know how bad that sounds, but I truly just don't. When I think of her, it's the first and only thing that comes to mind anymore. After we fought one night for hours, it closed with her saying "I guess you won't talk to me anymore for a while, or ever, I don't know." I said I'd still talk to her, trying to be nice to her, but in all honesty, I just don't want to. I can't see her the same way anymore and I don't think I ever will again.</p>

        <p>I took one off this 19 year old kid my girlfriend’s younger sister is friends with. Came to the house with a gift but had a mask on. I roasted him a little and took it off his face. Not forcefully, but like a dude would to another dude if that makes sense.</p>

        <p>Care to actually address, I don't know, ANY of my points instead of just swearing at me like a 12-year-old? Care to tell me why you think I'm wrong or why we should all wear muzzles around anyone, let alone our closest friends? What are you even trying to accomplish here? Or is it just that you can't be bothered to argue so you just make a personal attack? Seriously, just tell me what I said that you think was wrong and I'll explain it.</p>
