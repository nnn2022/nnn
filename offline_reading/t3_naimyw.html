    <strong>I would have cared more if it was about the kids.</strong>
    <p><p>Well over a year into this, and well over 99% of us have survived.  It's criminal really, what we've had to endure.  I give a lot of leeway to the early restrictions, because it was new.  It isn't new anymore.  But it <em>does</em> seem to be lethal, to some people.  All I'm saying is, if it happened to be children, and for argument's sake, children at random, who suffer because of this virus, then I'd be more likely to comply and worry and all that other stuff.  But it isn't.  Not by a long shot.  If it was kids, even though the risk was the same, I would give more of a care.  I would put the mask on more readily.  We always have to protect the children.  Instead, we are teaching our children to be afraid, and it's a damn shame.</p></p>

        <p>And now we are going to be injecting kids against a virus that barely touches them, forcing them to deal with terrible side effects and risk a higher chance of death from the vaccine for no reason at all.</p>
<p>It's not as if the olds and fats haven't already gotten themselves vaccinated and should be safe.</p>

        <p>I agree. We protect our children. Its instincts. 
We are blessed that this virus seems to forgo them for the most part. </p>
<p>HOWEVER... this is robbing our children of life, education, happiness, even food in many places. </p>
<p>It makes me so angry. I am privileged. My kids do have enough to eat. Did they have education this year? Hardly. But I am starting to wonder if that was a blessing in disguise. </p>
<p>I cannot even believe the crazy we are bringing kids up in.</p>
