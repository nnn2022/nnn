        <p>It will affect everyone, however</p>
<p>- I never stated that it will not affect the people protesting pandemic ( But the state tends to be more agresive on left-wing protests, always has been and always will be, but still probably anti-pandemic ones will also get arrested)</p>
<p>- I just wanted to correct misinformation, as you made it seem like this bill was writen after some anti-pandemic group did protests. Now correcting misinformation is kinda important as this is what got these fashi motherfuckers into the power in the first place.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit- Kinda read up about, actualy the bill tageted other left-wing protests, such as BLM and the one about climate change</p>

        <p>Since we are correcting misinformation, I think it's important to mention that this new bill was drafted before the vigil/protest for Sarah Everard even went ahead.
The bill was drafted on the 9th March and the vigil was on the 13th March. 
How could parliament have known there would be violence 4 days before it happened? They didn't. The government won't let a tragedy go to waste though. A lot easier to get public support if they blame it on those protestors.</p>

<h2>"Why is the government changing the law on protesting now?</h2>
<p>Ministers say existing public order legislation was passed in 1986 and is no longer fit for managing modern protests, such as those by Extinction Rebellion (XR). Patel has been highly critical of XR and Black Lives Matter (BLM). She <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/08/extinction-rebellion-criminals-threaten-uks-way-of-life-says-priti-patel">described XR as “so-called eco-crusaders turned criminals”</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/feb/12/priti-patel-hits-out-at-dreadful-black-lives-matters-protests">called the BLM protests “dreadful”</a>."</p>

Republican party acorrding to multiple experts from the european union has tried to do a coup, and there is so much more stuff that we have not talked about yet, but you know what? I have a better idea- please give me your definition of fascism. I will start by giving you one, and explaning why is he a fascist</p>
<p><a href="https://www.openculture.com/2016/11/umberto-eco-makes-a-list-of-the-14-common-features-of-fascism.html">https://www.openculture.com/2016/11/umberto-eco-makes-a-list-of-the-14-common-features-of-fascism.html</a></p>
<p>The cult of tradition. “One has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.”</p>
<p>Trump fits this point, his entire slogan is returning to the "glory days of america".</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The rejection of modernism. “The Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.”</p>
<p>- do not know if he personaly reject modernism, but he seems to not tolerate few things which happend due to enlightenment or the ideas that happend from it</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The cult of action for action’s sake. “Action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.”</p>
<p>- In his latest speach at CPAC he did not spoke about policy, or plans, just "we need to take power back", so i would consider it a cult of action for action sake.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Disagreement is treason. “The critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.”</p>
<p>- Few conservative politicians were called a trators to the republican party, and Trump and his party did call democrats anti-american communist's few times.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Fear of difference. “The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.”</p>
<p>- Trump and the republican party has claimed many times that actualy the schools are controled by marxists's, antifa burned down cities and are comming for you, their first few years kept telling about how the mexicans are flooding into america, etc.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Appeal to social frustration. “One of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups.”</p>
<p>Yup, i do not think i need to add anything</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The obsession with a plot. “Thus at the root of the Ur-Fascist psychologythere is the obsession with a plot, possibly an international one. The followers must feel besieged.” "</p>
<p>The democrats stole the elections" type of bullshit</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The enemy is both strong and weak. “By a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.”</p>
<p>"democrats are stong enought so they could steal the elections, but also are bunch of incompetent dinosaurs"</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. “For Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.”</p>
<p>Last few months they have spend on fighting the liberals, rather than actual problems. It not necesary fits with trump, but is relativly close.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Contempt for the weak. “Elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.”</p>
<p>Im not sure if he said somthing that presented disrespect towords the poor, but his policy is very much anti-poor.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Everybody is educated to become a hero. “In Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.”</p>
<p>I do not remember the particualr instance, but im preety sure that he said somthing along these lines, i would have to recheck some older speaches.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Machismo and weaponry. “Machismo implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.”</p>
<p>Trump is preety anti-lgbt, and the republican state policy is still anti gay marriage.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Selective populism. “There is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.”</p>
<p>Silent mayority type of bullshit</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak. “All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.”</p>
<p>In his speaches he used very simply speach</p>

        <p>Love the fact that you did not repond to my argument. I will expand it. </p>
<p>Trump tried to create a patriotic education - which was ment to be a re-shaping of American education that would focus history on idealized version of america - do you think that it is not fascist? Past fascist states have often used idealized version of their history, that ignored everysingle bad thing about said country </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Ever since he lost the election Trump has been claming that it was stolen from him, and during the storming of the capital hill, for some reason the security was  very low, for some reason all the panic buttons were destroyed, for some reason the police just let the mob walk into the capitol building, and before it Trump himself encoruged the mob to march to the capitol. During the siege itself there were people screeming about wanting to kill politicians, and the news reporters etc. After this all hapend around 50% of the republican party supported this siege, and multiple security officials from the european union claimed that this was a failed coup attempt - do you think that this could have been a failed coup attempt? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The republican party has been calling democrats radical marxist, has been claming that they worked with Venezuela and Chinain order to take over america- do you think that calling everyone "communist working with enemy is to destroy the nation" is not part of fascist ideology?  Older fascist states have been using anti-communist as a justification for opresion and war. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also, dude you are the one that posts stuff on a subreddit that thinks that pandemic does not exist, or it should be ignored- i do not know who is the one that needs to take meds.</p>

        <p>Are you anti-science my dude? There were few studies that claim that left-wing protests did not significaly increse the number of covid cases</p>

<p><em>"There is a clear and significant negative correlation between the percentage of a state’s population who reported protesting and the subsequent increase in cases of COVID-19  Thus, for example, Washington D.C., which had by far the highest reported participation rates in the protests at 13.7%, had a relatively low increase in cases during this period.

        <p>"Ooooo but.. Butttt... When the benevolent Tory government (which we said was fascist before 2020) said that gatherings were illegal, we thought it was only for THEM. And for the benefit of thaaa NHS and public health because the govt really care about our health....and, even though we ostensibly hate them, we want the govt to assume full control over our lives. But obvvvviously none of this should apply to feminist BLM trans marches, or anything WE agree with. Because when WE March we're good people but when THEY do it they're not.

        <p>I’m scared too, this is terrifying. How can anyone in the US read something like this and still think it’s better for government to have full control over businesses and force everyone to wear a mask!? Totalitarianism is not the solution to a pandemic! We are literally watching every single dystopian novel come to life and people think that one person not wearing a mask at Walmart is the worst! That the business that refuses to close and the church still having service are the enemy. I’ve never been so scared for the future than I am now. Vaccines being pushed on the entire world with less than a year of testing, and governments taking over every single thing in first world countries. What will it take for people to wake up!!?</p>

        <p>I think it's important to mention that this new bill was drafted before the vigil/protest for Sarah Everard even went ahead.
The bill was drafted on the 9th March and the vigil was on the 13th March. 
How could parliament have known there would be violence 4 days before it happened? They didn't. The government won't let a tragedy go to waste though. A lot easier to get public support if they blame it on those protestors.</p>

        <p>Intrestingly we are both are actualy kinda wrong,this bill orginaly targeted BLM and eco-protests. It had nothing to do with pandemic protests.</p>
<p>"Why is the government changing the law on protesting now?</p>
<p>Ministers say existing public order legislation was passed in 1986 and is no longer fit for managing modern protests, such as those by Extinction Rebellion (XR). Patel has been highly critical of XR and Black Lives Matter (BLM). She <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/08/extinction-rebellion-criminals-threaten-uks-way-of-life-says-priti-patel">described XR as “so-called eco-crusaders turned criminals”</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/feb/12/priti-patel-hits-out-at-dreadful-black-lives-matters-protests">called the BLM protests “dreadful”</a>."</p>
