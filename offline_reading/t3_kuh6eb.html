    <strong>I absolutely hate living in a faceless society.</strong>
    <p><p>I couldn't be more captain obvious with this post, but I really just need to vent.</p>
<p>I mean, that's pretty much what society has become anyway...faceless. Seriously, it just makes me want to stay inside now all the time (which is pretty much what I do anyway since I have an online job).</p>
<p>Going to the store now is just depressing as fuck. Not being able to see people's faces and them looking like brainwashed dead-eyed machines who don't even talk or look at each other is honestly disturbing. And even when I'm not at the store, I still see people wearing masks by themselves (like going out for a walk) and it just makes me sad.</p>
<p>Like the other day when I was driving, and I saw a guy who was standing by himself waiting at the crosswalk and he had a fucking face-mask on. It's like we live in a society where people's faces have been removed and if you dare show it at the store or anywhere, you'll be shunned.</p>
<p>A lot of people would say to me "but we're in the middle of a pandemic", but those same people act like no one is allowed to have even a single complaint about masks regardless of even if that person does wear a mask in the store and follow the rules.</p>
<p>Once the vaccine starts rolling out more, I'm seriously wondering if masks are still going to be mandatory in stores for a long time after. It's become so trendy that I don't see it going away overnight at all.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah I wear a mask but also hate them and voice my opinion when given the chance. People always reply with "you're the problem/reason the pandemic has lasted so long" and I'm like dude I WEAR A MASK. Why do people assume if you don't like masks you must not wear them?</p>
<p>Hell, I assumed everyone hated wearing masks until people started shaming me for feeling that way. Same with I'll make a fb post for example, I made one the other day saying "I can't wait to never have to wear a mask again." 0 likes from friends/family. Lol literally 0.</p>

        <p>Don‚Äôt judge your opinions of of Facebook ‚Äúlikes‚Äù or any social media approval. Terrible way to go about things.  Ditch the social media is step 1.  Live your life as you want to, causing no harm or even inconvenience to anyone else, is step 2.  </p>
<p>I stay home too.  They have accomplished their goal, but it will all come home to roost, if everyone would close their wallets, and vote in disapproval by not spending a dime, especially to businesses and governments through sales taxes, by spending NOTHING.  This entire movement has worked to ensure they still have access to our money, all while not having us visit them in person, and if/when we do, in complete and total obedience. Vote NO.</p>

<p>Social media is how I stay occupied while forced to live at home. It also helps me feel less alone. I don't care if people approve or not of my posts, which is exactly why I made the post. 0 likes is fine with me. I was just proving a point about the general discourse. Not whining about likes.</p>

        <p>Again: vapour in exhaled smoke is not the same as the spittle expelled from a cough. There are many different factors that make these things different. This is basic science that my 10 year old is aware of, yet it's something you seem averse to.</p>
<p>It's funny how you respond within seconds of a post and ignore 99% of what I just said to you, choosing only to focus on a single line, likely because you're angry and lack an adult attention span. It's painfully obvious that you lack intelligence and common sense and it's incredibly sad, it's also apparent in the way you talk and the language you use.</p>
<p>I'll break this down nice and simple for you and leave you to it (not that it will stop you from spewing more nonsense) - Scientific study tells us that masks are effective. You lose, thanks for playing, better luck next time!</p>

        <p>Well since you claim to be above "skimming" allow me to give you some scientific literature to familiarize yourself with.</p>
<p>&rt;Here is some evidence mask don't work and in fact could be harmful.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372?fbclid=IwAR0ULN8J0yuwpkr5Fzn6iJQsVsAFkYFuy_-0I7WX_38I02TRcf1NmlHcRj8">New England Journal of Medicine</a> :</p>
<p>"<em>We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers</em> <strong><em>little, if any, protection from infection</em></strong>. <em>Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes).</em> <strong><em>The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal</em></strong>*. <em>In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic."</em></p>
<p>Fauci said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZcTqW1Ngj4">that mask may help someone "feel better" but don't do much</a> .</p>
<p>Also from the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/transmission-of-sars-cov-2-implications-for-infection-prevention-precautions#:~:text=Airborne%20transmission%20is%20defined%20as,long%20distances%20and%20time">WHO</a> :</p>
<p>"<em>The physics of exhaled air and flow physics have generated</em> <strong><em>hypotheses about possible mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through aerosols</em></strong>*.(13-16) These* <strong><em>theories</em></strong> <strong><em>suggest</em></strong> <em>that 1) a number of respiratory droplets generate microscopic aerosols (&lt;5 ¬µm) by evaporating, and 2) normal breathing and talking results in exhaled aerosols. Thus, a susceptible person could inhale aerosols, and could become infected if the aerosols contain the virus in sufficient quantity to cause infection within the recipient. However, the proportion of exhaled droplet nuclei or of respiratory droplets that evaporate to generate aerosols, and the infectious dose of viable SARS-CoV-2 ¬†required to cause infection in another person are</em> <strong><em>not known</em></strong>*, <em>but it has been studied for other respiratory viruses.(17)"</em></p>
<p>Additional studies confirming the same thing:</p>
<ol>
<li>A randomized controlled trial by the<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029744"> University of Michigan-School of Public Health</a> found hand washing reduced influenza-like illnesses; while mask wearing made no difference whatsoever.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-12-26">German randomized controlled trial</a> found ‚Äúthere was no statistically significant effect‚Äù when it came to wearing masks ‚Äúon secondary infections.‚Äù</li>
<li>A 2010 randomized study in the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/201/4/491/861190">The Journal of Infectious Diseases </a>found that neither ‚Äúface mask use and hand hygiene nor face mask use alone was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of influenza-like illnesses cumulatively.‚Äù</li>
<li>A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00205.x">randomized controlled trial conducted in Thailand</a> during the H1N1 pandemic found ‚ÄúInfluenza transmission was not reduced by interventions to promote hand washing and face mask use.‚Äù</li>
<li>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/003335491012500206">19-month randomized controlled trial</a> of crowded urban households found a significant reduction in upper respiratory infection through educational interventions; but no reduction when adding hand sanitizers or masks.</li>
<li>A randomized controlled trial of people sleeping together in tents during an Islamic pilgrimage was reported in <a href="https://www.eurekaselect.com/125489/article">Infectious Disorders</a>. Researchers found no difference in laboratory confirmed influenza cases among those wearing masks and those who were not.¬†</li>
<li>A <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013998">randomized trial in France</a> found that mask wearing only produced a 0.4% reduction in secondary infection and ‚Äúdid not identify any trend in the results suggesting effectiveness of facemasks.‚Äù</li>

<p><strong>CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel</strong> page 39 they have not isolated the virus :</p>
<p>"<em>The analytical sensitivity of the rRT-PCR assays contained in the CDC 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019- nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel were determined in Limit of Detection studies.</em> <strong><em>Since no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently available</em></strong>*, <em>assays designed for detection of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length RNA (N gene; GenBank accession: MN908947.2) of known titer (RNA copies/ŒºL) spiked into a diluent consisting of a suspension of human A549 cells and viral transport medium (VTM) to mimic clinical specimen. Samples were extracted using the QIAGEN EZ1 Advanced XL instrument and EZ1 DSP Virus Kit (Cat# 62724) and manually with the QIAGEN DSP Viral RNA Mini Kit (Cat# 61904). Real-Time RT-PCR assays were performed using the ThemoFisher Scientific TaqPathTM 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix, CG (Cat# A15299) on the Applied BiosystemsTM 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument according to the CDC 2019-nCoV Real- Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel instructions for use</em>*.

<p>This is further corroborated by Dr Tom Cowan in his <a href="https://blog.nomorefakenews.com/2020/10/19/dr-tom-cowan-explores-the-covid-virus-invented-out-of-sheer-nonsense/">article</a> titled:</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tom Cowan explores the COVID virus invented out of sheer nonsense</strong></p>
<p><em>‚ÄúFirst, in the section titled ‚ÄòWhole Genome Sequencing,‚Äô we find that rather than having isolated the virus and sequencing the genome from end to end, they found 37 base pairs from unpurified samples using PCR probes. This means they actually looked at 37 out of the approximately 30,000 of the base pairs that are claimed to be the genome of the intact virus. They then took these 37 segments and put them into a computer program, which filled in the rest of the base pairs.‚Äù</em></p>
<p><em>In other words, the sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was done by assumption and arbitrary inference. If this is science, a penguin is a spaceship.</em></p>

        <p>Not my first rodeo champ, all of the "science" in the copy and paste wall that you obviously have saved down as if it's your smoking gun, has been disproven, shown to be nonsense (first article you've shared is literally an opinion piece) and in some cases (Tom Cowan's insanity) sheer propaganda.

        <p>Convenient your account is brand spanking new and have no history backing up any research you've done. While Tom's article is definitely an opinion piece the links from the WHO and CDC are not, interestingly it supports the above mentioned pdfs from those two health authorities. I hesitate to call them that since the CDC is a private organization that doesn't specialize in public health but for the manufacturing of drugs for profit, but hey, why quibble over semantics, right?</p>

        <p>&rt;"<em>Damn someone better inform the CDC and the WHO that the multitudes of studies that have proven otherwise are actually wrong because a jumped up pseudo-intellectual on Reddit said so."</em></p>
<p>So are the CDC and WHO credible or not? The "copy and paste wall" as you put it, has excerpts from those two entities yet all of the sudden they are </p>
<p>&rt;"<em>opposed by literally every credible public health board in the entire world ? "</em></p>
<p>So who exactly are the "other" credible public health boards that disagree with those two? </p>
<p>Of course you end up quoting the easily frazzled Ben Shapiro when he's not debating hapless liberal college students, lol.</p>

<p>Depends? Are they in a rural or urban area?</p>
<p>I don't wear a mask when I'm out running but I live in a rural ass area and might only encounter 3-4 people (sometimes 0) during a 5 mile run. If so I give a very wide berth (20+ feet). </p>
<p>If I was in an urban area and running or walking a dog (I don't have dogs) I would wear a mask though because I'd probably end up close to a couple dozen or more people, even if it wasn't rush hour.</p>

        <p>Dude, I just went to the store an hour ago (maskless in Maskachusetts and nobody said a word to me), and I tried to make eye contact with a pretty lady, and the way she darted her eyes away and shamefully lowered her head to the floor was just so depressing. She genuinely looked like a dog that's been abused by it's owner. The only thing missing was the sad whimpering. I honestly just wanted to hug her and comfort her, and take off her mask. :(</p>

        <p>This isn't a mask problem. It's a stranger trying to make eye contact with a "pretty lady." She most likely assumed you were being a creep and made her uncomfortable. Or she could be like me and doesn't like eye contact at all. Or maybe she didn't want to make eye contact with someone not wearing a mask. It also isn't your job to "save her" from the mask.</p>
<p>If you're allowed the freedom to not wear a mask, then other people should still have the freedom to wear a mask if they damn well please.</p>

I understand why people break eye contact, but the vibe I got from this person wasn't "I'm shy," or "I don't want to talk to you," which I understand. The vibe I got was, "I <em>can't</em> interact with you, because that's taboo." ...I could be wrong, but that's definitely the impression I got.</p>

        <p>I have PTSD. From sexual abuse. Wearing a mask is not an option and seeing them everywhere terrifies me. I'm now afraid to even look outside. I don't look at media if I can help it so I'm not triggered. If I do go into a shop, it feels like running a gauntlet, trying not to look at anyone and hoping no one confronts me. It's truly hellish.</p>
<p>I'm essentially trapped in my home, alone. Traumatised.</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry. I'm a mental health social worker and I have a few clients who, for mental health reasons, find wearing a mask to be either triggering or almost impossible. (Most have severe paranoid schizophrenia) I feel for them so much, and yet my agency won't allow me to meet with them because they "refuse to wear a mask". It's disgusting and I'm sorry.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>I found a doc in the fall. I'm very lucky! It's virtual but nearly the same as in person. I fear I won't ever see him in person but I also know that I can't do anything in person because of the mask rules, which will only get stricter and will be here for years.</p>
<p>I cannot understand how people can wear them. I did once, for just under an hour, and was physically sick for days after. I admire the mental strength of people who can wear them. At first, I was "anti-mask" for political reasons. Those don't matter now - I'm trying to get comfortable touching one in my pocket and have a goal to wear one. Politics pales in comparison to my trying to survive this nightmare. I can't imagine wearing one for hours on end. It makes me anxious just looking at them.</p>
<p>The Covid Fairy truly gave me a precious with the Pandemic. If I make it through alive (and can co-exist with masks) I'll have such fond memories to look back on.  /s</p>

        <p>Good point! People said they cared about mental health in 2019, but in 2020 it was all forgotten. Because of the burden these restrictions may give many, therefor I made the subreddit r/MaskTalk. It discuss mental health with security theater.</p>

        <p>Being ahead of the curve can be a painful place to be. In the future when lung disease becomes widespread as a result of the masking (inhaling toxic fibers from polypropylene and other chemicals just part of the reason), the tide will turn. Plus they literally don't work.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe moisture from exhalation inside the mask, when in constant contact with the 37 degrees Celsius warm human body, becomes ideal place for virus and bacteria to thrive,‚Äù</p>
<p>he said. This could result in the growth of microbes on masks and aid the spread of airborne diseases like influenza</p>

        <p>Those things have been out for well over a decade because I use to have one. I think they went away for awhile because they weren't deemed as secure because someone could walk by you and pick up your credit card info. I don't know if they did anything to make them better or if they just leave that part out because nothing matters now but corona.</p>

        <p>The front has no raised text and looks like stock blank. Nobody uses the old carbon press receipt printer anymore that I know of. Last I retail worked was in the early 21 Century. The raised text is a scum collecter for sure. I will stop short of subdermal chips and tatoos and yes credit cards very soon. :) It is now a barter life for me.</p>

        <p>Speaking of wearing masks. So I have just started this new job. There was this chic in the reception I was eyeing since day 1. Thought she was cute....Then I went  in break one day, saw her without a mask and she was a butterface. Totally looks old and has ton of acne and a fucked up set of teeth. Oh well.</p>

        <p>What kind of off road vehicle? I've been having similar thoughts but I lean more towards getting a bad ass dirt bike and just storing that in the back of a truck or something because you can generally go places in a dirt bike that no off road vehicle could even go. </p>
<p>Park your vehicle somewhere safe and then you could potentially ride that dirt bike MILES into woods that have no trails so who the fuck is coming to get you? Only someone who has a dirt bike or who really wants to walk far through the middle of the woods. </p>
<p>You'd have to do things to cover up the fact that you will be making a trail though. I'd imagine at least if you through some brush over the beginning of the trail than that would take care of 99% of people who might be curious because they aren't going to investigate any further to see.</p>

        <p>I don't even know if I would bother with a pickup for myself. Maybe just a sedan with a decent engine so I can trailer the dirt bike if need be. If I do go that route than I'll prob get a cheap minivan due to how much space they have and they can easily tow a dirt bike. </p>

<p>where would you want to live off grid? would you do it alone or with likeminded friends and family?  ive considered living off grid but i have concerns about being tethered to one spot; id rather be nomadic so that its harder for unsavory people to find me</p>
