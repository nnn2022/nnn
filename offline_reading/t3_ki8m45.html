    <strong>The most vocal online doomer nurses don't seem like very intelligent nor articulate people and seem to have an extreme lack of empathy.</strong>
    <p><p>I've noticed this since moderating here. I go through lots of comment history to see if someone is trolling and in many cases I do believe these people are nurses.</p>
<p>My first question is then, what are nursing programs like and what qualifications are needed to become a nurse? Are these people getting Bsc or BA degrees or can they get a post-highschool certificate of some kind?</p>
<p>Second, is are they required any ethics training? Are they periodically reviewed for mental health concerns? I can appreciate being a nurse may lead to lots of stress and perhaps mental health issues. They should receive care for this by their employer but they're made unstable by such an illness they should probably be removed from patient care and put in a temporary administrative role or something else. The vile comments from these people and absolute disdain for their fellow humans makes me believe this is a toxic situation for all involved, patients and nurses as well as coworkers.</p></p>

        <p>No I assumed they probably aren't going to be receptive to conversation after I banned them for calling someone a moron plague rat who should decline to breed but maybe I'll give it a shot if I don't get helpful answers in this thread.</p>

        <p>Very fair!  I'm not gonna lie, I used to feel very differently when this first started.  Simple, human conversation I think is the key.</p>
