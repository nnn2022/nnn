        <p>This is the first and only RCT we have on mask effectiveness against COVID-19 in community settings, but <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/ip5fu0/scientific_evidence_and_crosscountry_variability/">its findings of ineffectiveness are fully expected in light of all the other RCTs we have on other respiratory viruses</a>. </p>
<p>Results:</p>
<p>&rt;A total of 3030 participants were randomly assigned to the recommendation to wear masks, and 2994 were assigned to control; 4862 completed the study. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 42 participants recommended masks (1.8%) and 53 control participants (2.1%). The between-group difference was −0.3 percentage point (95% CI, −1.2 to 0.4 percentage point; P = 0.38) (odds ratio, 0.82 [CI, 0.54 to 1.23]; P = 0.33). Multiple imputation accounting for loss to follow-up yielded similar results. <strong>Although the difference observed was not statistically significant, the 95% CIs are compatible with a 46% reduction to a 23% increase in infection</strong>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if you forward these results to other folks, to truly appreciate the significance of the study they need to understand the hierarchy of evidence in biomedical research: an RCT sits on the top of that hierarchy, and should be given much more weight than observational studies, modelling studies, and laboratory studies. So please educate the people to whom you forward this because otherwise they will reply "but I have a long list of studies [observational, laboratory, modelling] that show that masks work".</p>

        <p>I'm glad this was finally published. Before we go posting this around, please remember that this study was not designed to address the source control aspect of mask wearing. It only looked at how masks protected the wearer. Turns out it's not much. </p>
<p>If you want to make an argument against large-scale public usage of masks, remember that most of those policies are based on the idea of source control (stopping an infected individual from spreading it to others). We'll need other studies in the future to address that.</p>

        <p>And also recognise that the study itself was inconclusive:</p>
<p>“The most important limitation is the that the findings are inconclusive.”</p>
<p>“Yet, the findings were inconclusive and cannot definitively exclude a 46% reduction to a 23% increase in infection of mask wearers in such a setting.”</p>
<p>Limitations were:</p>
<p>“Inconclusive results, missing data, variable adherence, patient-reported findings on home tests, no blinding, and no assessment of whether masks could decrease disease transmission from mask wearers to others.”</p>

        <p>They no doubt had to put in that self-effacing section on limitations in order to get it published. Remember, they were turned down by three journals at first. Regardless, this is big for us because the study is the biggest of its kind and is inconclusive- i.e. the null hypothesis that masks are not protective still stands. The burden of proof is on those making the claim that they are effective, not us. This is all we need.</p>

        <p>They had to boilerplate it with "this should not be used to conclude that a recommendation for everyone to wear masks in the community would not be effective" to get it published. Jesus, is there any getting through to these people? If the study shows no or little protection, which is what everyone knew already, then what reason is there to mandate them? They present their findings and then undermine them by inferring the exact opposite conclusion to what the data clearly shows.</p>
