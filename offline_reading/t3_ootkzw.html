    <strong>Why *hasn't* the FDA approved these vaccines?</strong>
    <p><p>The doomers tell us its just a matter of filling out a few forms, dotting the "i"s, etc. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Are there forces within the FDA that are fighting a quick "rubber-stamping"?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are they concerned about legal challenges/consequences to quick approval?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perhaps the FDA thinks if they shorten the approval process down from several years to a few months, it'll be difficult to ever go back to the old way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Something else entirely?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm genuinely curious why they seem to be "dragging their feet" on approval, when just about every other U.S. federal govt agency is 100% on-board with pushing "the vaccine is the only way to save us" narrative.</p></p>

        <p>Because if and when FDA approves this, there won't be an experimental stage where you bear all the consequences and consent that they are not guilty since it's voluntary. FDA approving it will mean that even one death related to the vaccines will backlash on them as they were the ones saying it's completely safe and has no long term consequences. </p>
<p>Any idea as to what that means? The whole COVID situation will go down in the history as the greatest worldwide hoax of all time. That's why they're trying to push it as fast as possible because the experimental phase ends in 2023, after which FDA will have nothing to approve since everyone is supposed to be vaccinated one way or another. By that time the globalists will have their agenda sorted out.</p>

        <p>Correct, they need only to drag the illegal state of emergency and the vaccine campaign on for long enough. In the end it will be too late to do anything about it. Except maybe mob justice, that is a possibility.</p>
