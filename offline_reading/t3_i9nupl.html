    <strong>Raindance Psychology</strong>
    <p><p>This is a term I've been using to describe the unbreakable circular logic that underpins most arguments in favor of lockdown measures.</p>
<p>For people who believe that the raindance will help bring the rain there's no way to ever prove them wrong. If it rains they are vindicated. If it doesn't rain it's because certain unbelievers aren't doing the dance.</p>
<p>When anything optimistic in the realm of covid happens they pat themselves on the back and say "See, the lockdowns are helping put down the pandemic" but if numbers go the other way they can deflect and blame the population that isn't wearing a mask or social distancing or whatever they come up with next.  </p>
<p>I don't know when lockdowns will end and things go back to normal, but no matter how this thing shakes out I can guarantee you that you'll never see any of the pro-lockdown crowd become convinced that this was a misguided, futile, and ultimately net-harmful experiment.  They can just fall back on raindance psychology.</p></p>

        <p>Great, standing Bear didn’t put his heart into his dancing, now we’re stuck with a shriveled corn field. He probably voted Chief Thunder Talk.</p>

        <p>Reminds me a lot of the concept of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult">cargo cults</a>. Also reminds me of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc">post hoc ergo propter hoc</a>: "because we did the thing, bad thing stopped! EVERYONE DO THE THING!" and "we did the thing, but bad thing didn't stop? THE THING WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH. MORE PEOPLE MUST DO THE THING! AND DO IT HARDER!"</p>
<p>The human mind is capable of wondrous creation. And marvelous self-deception.</p>

        <p>Excuse me.
I'll have you know the rain dances I did all through  late April - mid July in my country brought the death rate down.</p>
<p>They then raised again slightly because my new dance was to get ICU inpatient numbers down. I've been lacking again through fatigue hence rising cases. Sorry.</p>
<p>It may not be entirely precise, but it has definitely been working. When the number change, you can tell the discipline of my dance.</p>
<p>Thank me, because I care about others, and do the right thing. I am kind, compassionate, and in the favour of Science.</p>
