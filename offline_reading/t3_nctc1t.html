    <strong>What's their next move?</strong>
    <p><p>All of these states are lifting their "mask mandates" like a domino effect. If we listened to what they were saying about the "numbers", then the "numbers" don't make sense to do this based on their own bullshit over the past year.</p>
<p>So, something else is brewing? What is it? Is it the vaccine passport? Are they giving a little "respite" before they bring back the tyrannical measures later this year? Are they getting ready to go digital currency? Crash the economy completely? </p>
<p>The coordination points to something brewing. And likely, it's not good.</p></p>

        <p>Right now they are literally actively promoting fraud with the paper vax passport. The obvious solution is to make it go digital. Give it a few years, and they will convince the masses with various incidents and accidents that it is better and safer and super convenient to always wear your health status on you: an implanted chip. This is going to be the Mark of the Beast if it will be connected to a pay system, eg crypto, through patent 060606. Never take the chip, ever, at any cost, even death is preferable. Read Revelations.</p>
<p>In the meantime we are working towards the Great Reset, with active destruction of economies and a Weimar hyperinflation that lead to it. This is already on the way for years in fact. After that big event, the script will most likely go to the staged alien contact. Those things will lead to the one world religion of atheism, and a one world government most likely. A lot to happen, this is a decisive decade in the final days. God bless.</p>

        <p>I like your theory but if we’re getting into real UFO/alien disclosure, I think that will happen next month, June or July. Maybe that’s why they took the mask mandate off, as to give us a bit of breathing room before the disclosure which is surely happening to distract from something bigger.</p>

        <p>Nobody can predict with such accuracy. They've been predicting alien contact for a century now. War of the Worlds was written 1898. You have no clue when, but it will.</p>

        <p>Have you been hearing all the buzz about disclosure 2021? It will happen as it was passed in the relief bill (stimulus) that Trump passed last year:</p>
<p>“The stipulation mandates that the director of national intelligence work with the secretary of defense on a report detailing everything the government knows about unidentified flying objects — known in agency lingo as “unidentified aerial phenomena” or “anomalous aerial vehicles.” “</p>
<p>https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/03/23/ufo-report-covid-bill/</p>
<p>WAPO and MSM are reporting it, and there are more and more videos and photos of UFOs being released from the government since the bill passed. This isn’t a subjective MSM talking point, this is actually happening.</p>

        <p>I have been alive for a third of a century and I never encountered or read about the US government actually making a plan to release UFO info to the public until now. I honestly hope I’m wrong, as it will add more strife to the society that constantly bombards us with tension and confrontation!</p>
<p>I think it will happen! It has started happening! When they reveal the beings that actually operate the UFOs, that will truly break us.</p>

        <p>Just know that aliens do not exist. At best, they are demons, fallen angels. At worst, they will fake it all. Doesn't matter, it will fool the masses into believing in the Universe™ and their irrelevance, "we are star dust", and forget about God, which is in the end, what this is all about.

        <p>Yes, they will be welcomed  I believe, as superior beings. Sorting all the petty differences between humans at once. I don't know if the script will include and eventual battle against them, which was also predicted many times if course.</p>

        <p>Look at all the vaxxd saying how they are “scared” to take off the mask and that those who are unvaxxd will lie and go around maskless. “How will we know they’re not lying!?”</p>
<p>They are setting a precedent for passport/papers, which are authoritarian and were “never going to happen”. These poor people will be begging for a disgusting regime that takes away our civil liberties.</p>
<p>There will be some false flag to really push the divide and fuel the flames between vaxxd and unvaxxd. Probably (I think) the vaxxd may start experiencing real side effects , which will be blamed on the spread of the NEW STRAIN via unvaccinated people.</p>

        <p>I saw a meme spouting triumph over the unvaccinated wanting to wearing masks to avoid the shedding from those who are jabbed. Basically, they assume we are all racist right wing Nazi Trumpers who never wear masks. Sadly this already crossed my mind and I wear my mask around my vaxxd coworkers at all times! Not for their benefit but for mine. You never know! </p>
<p>I wonder how humanity will view this pandemic/vaccine in a year, five years, fifty years! We may never know the implications of this in our lifetime.</p>
