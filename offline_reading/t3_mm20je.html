    <strong>Florida and no masks</strong>
    <p><p>Planning on moving to Florida for obvious reasons. I'm wondering for those of you currently living In Florida is not wearing a mask accepted mostly everywhere In the state or not? What are the better cities where no mask is totally normal and accepted?</p></p>

        <p>In my experience Florida is not even the best state for this. Go to any rural area in the south. Here in TN I can go into plenty of stores and see almost no one wearing a mask. A friend of mine went to visit a friend who worked at university of Alabama and he said almost no one on campus was wearing one - and that’s a college campus, which are the most insane places in most states. </p>
<p>There are plenty of places to go to escape the dystopia. For now.</p>

        <p>Wow thank you for this information it really gives me hope. Im in Upstate NY and there are very few places that allow you in without masks and if you do go in without one you're essentially a criminal to everyone else.</p>

        <p>At my corner grocery store, not even employees wear masks. As someone not originally from the south, it took me years to adjust to the culture. There are definitely some idiosyncrasies I’ll never understand, but I’ll be damned if this past year didn’t give me a whole new appreciation for rural southern culture and their lack of nosy authoritarianism. Most folks around me just want to live their lives and be left alone, but they’re also not mean about that. They’re friendly, but they don’t take kindly to being told what to do. </p>

        <p>Orange County too (Orlando), I was in Tallahassee recently and went to Walmart without a mask on.  But nobody said a word.  I do take your word on these counties though, especially Palm Beach.  I saw they were arresting people for being without them.</p>

        <p>I've been in Panama City for a few months. The panhandle area is pretty mask free. Only people masking up are people getting out of cars with Minnesota, New York, or NJ plates. Some stores still have signs ups, but literally no one enforces anything and that includes big corporations like Walmart, Target, Starbucks, ect. Some places even dropped mandates for employees. </p>
<p>Panhandle area pretty much has no Covid restrictions, but isn't really good on jobs unless you're looking to get into the tourism industry and pay in Florida is sub par with a high cost of living. That's the downfall of Florida the good old sunshine tax.</p>

        <p>Yeah I’m East TN and I thought it was like that everywhere at first, but in NC and GA they’re definitely more bitchy about it. I’ve been going to big chain stores in East TN this whole time without a mask and never once got even so much as a reprimand, but I got the cops called on me for being <em>outside</em> without a mask at a fucking Apple orchard in Georgia. </p>
<p>I will never go back to Mercier Orchard in Blue Ridge. Just putting that out there</p>
<p>Edited to add, in case anyone thinks there’s more to the story: I was minding my own business walking outside with family when an employee screamed at me and walked all the way up to me, and when I didn’t say a word to her harassment, she physically assaulted me and tried to restrain me. I didn’t fight back, but I did decide to walk back to my car and leave with my wife. I was legally carrying a firearm and was keenly aware that any escalation on my part would mean a hell of a lot more trouble than I was willing to go through on vacation. At that point she called 911 and started yelling for police to come. I left before they got there and never got any follow up from them.</p>

        <p>You can go into Walmart without a mask anywhere. I travel the entire east coat often and lived in NY. Employees are not allowed to enforce it in Walmart. I hate seeing people on this sub push the idea that you have to where masks. Sometimes this sub is just as bad as a doomer sub. Stop being afraid of confrontation, stop obeying the sign, and take the mask off, you're your own demise at this point.</p>

        <p>When I said “have to” wear masks I meant the store requires it. People think stores in FL and TX aren’t forcing masks on their employees but in reality they are.</p>

        <p>businesses can require it, but that doesnt mean you have to wear one. Corporations are terrified of offending paying customers. Word gets out on the street that you can't shop there without a mask and business declines rapidly</p>

        <p>The bigger the city, the more masks will be worn and required by businesses, even in "open" states like Florida and Texas. If you genuinely don't want masks, your best bet is smaller towns, in fairly red states. My sister lives out in South Eastern Idaho, and masks have never been a thing there. Kids have been in school the whole time with no masks. Most people don't wear masks in stores, but employees still wear them a national chains like Walmart or restaurants. This is pretty common in rural America.</p>

        <p>I live in Jacksonville, FL.  Mask mandate was dropped March 26th.  Some do, and some don't.  I stopped wearing ANYTHING back in November.  Go to Publix, Walmart, etc and never had an issue.  It depends on some of the local businesses.  Most do not enforce it, but you may want to check before you go.  Clay County, Middleburg, there is NO mandate.  It is a rural area though.  Miami-Dade, Orlando, and Gainesville are mask freaks.  They are also STRICT.  We went to Orlando a couple weeks ago and my boyfriend got chased down in Walgreens to put on a mask.  In Jacksonville, it is 50/50.  Except in doctor's offices, etc.</p>

        <p>West coast and the panhandle are supposedly the best parts of the state right now. I haven't been back because I won't fly and it's a day's drive.</p>

        <p>I visited south Florida in December and March (after state mask mandate lifted). </p>
<p>Activity levels were the same (everywhere was packed), but I saw more faces (excluding eating/drinking) in December, which was surprising. </p>
<p>I also had more store employees ask me to wear a mask in March than in December - definitely felt like a step backwards.</p>

        <p>Collier county is about half and half. No one will twist your arm to wear one, it’s by your own volition if you choose to wear one. It’s largely made up of midwesterners that are sick of their states control and mandates. Great people if you ask me.</p>
