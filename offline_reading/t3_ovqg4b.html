    <strong>If anything goes bad, the doctors that apply the vaxx will be sentenced, not politicians and vax companies</strong>
    <p><p>I am talking legally. Correct me if I am wrong. If a massive adverse effects break out, you will be held responsible. Not politicians. They'll just wash their hands and keep them clean. But doctors who apply the vaxx will be liable. So beware if you are a doctor, its a double edged sword. Legally, you will be under the bus, not anyone. I think this happened in nazi trials also. The doctors back then couldnt say stuff like "government said this was good for them" in their defense and avoid penalty. So doctors must be careful of what they say and do.</p></p>

        <p>No they won't. They're free from liability since we went into a state of emergency. Also, I think all vaccines fall under the 1986 act when they are required by the government so you can't sue anyone. You have to go to an omnibus court with a magistrate and they will decide whether you prove your injury was caused by a vaccine, provided the injury is on the table of reimbursible injuries</p>

        <p>I'm not sure why you're downvoting me. I agree with you that all of this is a crime against humanity. </p>
<p>But the courts are compromised and the many millions of deaths from the vaccine will simply be blamed on covid mutating, as we have all been talking about since before the "vaccine" was released.</p>
<p>The courts will simply throw any court cases blaming the vaccines for deaths out of court. There is a reason even MSM networks that go against the narrative like sky news in australia are being censored on youtube. Do you think an international court honestly has the power to stand up to these sort of people?</p>

        <p>I’d say you’re the naive one. The fact you even expect society to survive this is surprising. If society somehow does survive these people will be punished either way. The control group is too big to pretend the side effects are mutations from the virus. We are still the majority in America. Thats 110~ million adults that won’t be affected by side effects but will watch their families die. Perpetrators will either be punished by international court or the people left.</p>

<p>Wait, I thought you were saying this would go to an international court and now you're saying society isn't going to survive?</p>
<p>&rt;If society somehow does survive these people will be punished either way.</p>
<p>With the exception of the holocaust virtually none of the mass crimes of the 20th century ever saw justice, the international court is a paper tiger. </p>
<p>&rt;The control group is too big to pretend the side effects are mutations from the virus.</p>
<p>Do you think facts still matter to the zombies watching CNN? They will believe whatever they are told. </p>
<p>Lot of facts are too obvious/too many big lies since 2020 but most people go along with it anyways. </p>
<p>&rt;We are still the majority in America.</p>
<p>Are we? What about once the mandates start to force more and more people and kids onto the jabs? If we even are a majority now it won't be for long if they start to threaten enough people's jobs. </p>
<p>&rt;Perpetrators will either be punished by international court or the people left.</p>
<p>Stalin wasn't punished by an international court, nor by the people that survived the russian genocides. Neither was mao. Or pol pot. </p>
<p>That's the beauty of a totalitarian state. Once you have it and have control over the press, you can kill as many demonized people (in this case those that decline the clotshot) as you want and people are too scared to go against the party and stand up to the lies.</p>

        <p>Stalin didn’t kill half his population and neither did mao or pol pot . Stalin killed like 20 million out of 200 million in the ussr. Thats only like 10 percent of the population. Imagine stalin times 5 directed only at the vaccinated. The vaccinated don’t matter dude they are already as good as dead. The unvaccinated aren’t brainwashed like you think. I think you severely underestimate the damage done to the scam by loosing half the population and more importantly loosing the entire brainwashed population which is the vaccinated. White people are only 34 percent vaccinated in America. Black people 26 percent. I think you bought into the propaganda it seems likely we will always be in the vast majority of non-brainwashed.</p>

<p>The point I was making is that mass murdering criminals are rarely held accountable due to the power they wield.</p>
<p>&rt;The vaccinated don’t matter dude they are already as good as dead.</p>
<p>I don't think it will be as fast as many people seem to think. More of a higher rate of death and lower fertility as people die in increasing numbers from all sorts of health issues the next 3-5 years an onwards. It's easier to cover up deaths in this manner due to this longer timeframe.</p>
<p>&rt;White people are only 34 percent vaccinated in America. Black people 26 percent.</p>
<p>That's only because people haven't been able to mass vaccinate their kids yet, and mandates in corporate america are coming to put additional pressure on adults that haven't. </p>
<p>&rt;The reason I don’t expect society to necessarily survive this should be obvious. Places like Canada will have almost no one left</p>
<p>I think depopulation is definitely a goal and is coming but I don't think it's going to be as quick as many seem to believe.</p>
