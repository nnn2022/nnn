        <p>Of course his opinion has enhanced value. But you, as a critical thinking individual, have to remember that doctors are human beings with flaws, who make mistakes and also have to worry about their paycheque.</p>

<p>So you make up your mind first and then find a doctor who agrees?  </p>
<p>I can't examine the books of every doctor I go to.  How do you know if they are motivated by money.  My doctor isn't giving me the shot.  He doesn't get paid if I get the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Because if they tell you not to they might lose their job. It isn't about protecting one paycheque it's about protecting every future paycheque.</p>
<p>Yes, generally I make up my mind first. I had an infection on my skin, went to the doc. She ordered blood work. I said I probably don't need it cause my body usually deals with this stuff fine. She ordered it anyway. I went home and threw the papers out. 3 days later the infection was gone.</p>
<p>I really just needed her to tell me I wasn't dying. The rest I can deal with myself.</p>

        <p>I'm thinking this is a canned response you often use.</p>
<p>Your evidence is consistent with your distrust of the medical business.  You have proven that medicine is not 100% free of bad actors.  But your case is guilt by association.  I think there must be some good products and people in the field.  Should we NEVER go to a doctor or fill a prescription again? My doctor and this vaccine aren't specifically addressed in any of those articles.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-39054778">BBC: Most scientists 'can't replicate studies by their peers'</a></p>

<p>&rt;”Few back then grasped that these vaccines might also be a huge, inadvertent, uncontrolled experiment in interspecies viral transmission. But <strong>from 1955 to 1963,</strong> according to a 1976 US National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded study, <strong>98 million Americans alone probably were exposed to polio vaccines contaminated with SV40—a monkey virus that can cause cancers in animals.”</strong></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”By 1960, scientists and vaccine manufacturers knew</strong> that monkey kidneys were sewers of simian viruses. Such contamination often spoiled cultures, including those of an NIH researcher named Bernice Eddy, who worked on vaccine safety.”</p>
<p>&rt;”As of 2003, SV40 had been <strong>found in human tumours in 18 developed countries.</strong> Bookchin and Schumacher claim that the rates of <strong>SV40-positive tumours seem highest in countries that used the greatest amount of contaminated Salk polio vaccine,</strong> including the UK, USA, and Italy.”</p>

<p>I'm looking at the data, at my age my odds of being hospitalized if I catch the virus are like 6%.  My deductible is really high.  I'm estimating it's about 20% for my spouse (also oldish, diabetic, obese, high blood pressure etc.)   Anyhow I am motivated to keep it out of my household.</p>
