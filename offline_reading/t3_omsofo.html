        <p>Yuck, I’m so glad I don’t live there.</p>
<p>I used to want to visit LA because I’m a huge GTA V fan (almost planned a trip there last year before it hit the fan) but not if they keep this shit up</p>

        <p>Meanwhile.. in soviet Manitoba...</p>
<p>A person who enters or remains in an indoor public place must wear a  mask in a manner that covers their mouth, nose and chin without gapping. An  indoor public space includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>any part of a retail store where the public has access;</li>
<li>any part of the common areas of a residential building;</li>
<li>a health care facility;</li>
<li>an educational institution or facility;</li>
<li>an elevator;</li>
<li>a motor vehicle used for public transportation, including a bus, taxi,  limousine or other vehicle for hire; </li>
<li>and a bus shelter, pedestrian tunnel or enclosed pedestrian walkway.</li>
</ul>
<p>The operator of an indoor public place must ensure that every person who  is not wearing a mask while in the indoor public place is given a reminder to  do so as soon as possible following entry.</p>
<p>Masks are not required if people are seated at least two metres from  others, or if there is a non-permeable physical barrier, such as a plexiglass  barrier. However, people need to wear a <br>
mask at all times while moving to or  from their seated position within the indoor public place.</p>
<p>In addition, employees, contractors or operators of an indoor public  place do not need to wear a mask while they are in an area where members of the  public do not normally have access, or if they are behind a non-permeable  physical barrier, including a plexiglass barrier.  </p>
<p>People can temporarily remove their mask while in an indoor public  place:</p>
<ul>
<li>to receive a service that requires the removal of their mask,</li>
<li>to deal with an emergency or medical purpose, </li>
<li>or to establish their identity.</li>
</ul>
<p>People who do not have to wear masks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a child who is under five years of age;</li>
<li>a person with a medical condition that is unrelated to COVID-19,  including breathing or cognitive difficulties or a disability, which prevents  them from safely wearing a mask; </li>
<li>and a person who is unable to put on or remove a mask without the assistance  of another person.</li>
</ul>
