        <p>Don't blame it on every person who works from home. Many tech professionals have been working remotely for years. They have nothing to gain from continuing lockdowns. If anything it's the entry level call center/paper pusher types who watch TV while they "work" from their couches that want it to continue like this. Just please don't vilify WFH as a whole, especially when so many people have been forced into that situation.</p>

        <p>Isn't funny how the media is now bending over backward to try and put any vaccine related injury or death in context? But up until this point, context was a completely foreign concept--like all of the front page sensationalized stories of the incredibly rare cases of young people who died or were hospitalized from Covid.</p>

        <p>It's very similar to how they counted deaths differently with Covid-19 versus any other disease in history. ("Died WITH Covid-19", etc... Within 30-60 days!)</p>
<p>They also counted cases, differently, pushing the PCR test cycle thresholds as high as 50 (even though Fauci can be heard in an interview saying any positive over 35 cycles is meaningless, not to mention Kary Mullis - the inventor of the test who would certainly agree if he was with us today.)</p>
<p>To have a comparison you must use one standard. "Can't compare apples to oranges", etc. But sadly the average intellectual capacity has fallen to the point most people can't understand that, and don't have the attention span such that you can explain it to them.</p>
<p>It doesn't help that so much credible dissent has been silenced through systemwide censorship... That, alone, is quite telling. When, in history, has the "good side" censored disagreement?</p>
<p>When there is a competition of ideas, truth will emerge. So what does it say about the side that uses force, coercion, propaganda, and censorship to advance their agenda?</p>

        <p>Because this is politics and fear porn. Not a search for truth or reasonable policy.</p>
<p>As long as mass testing keeps going on there will always be positive cases. Not because people are infected but due to tests always running a chance for false positives. </p>
<p>You can test for a virus that doesn't exist. Never have existed, never will. But if you do 200k tests per day you'll be able to show hundreds or even thousands of positive cases floating around. If you focus these tests on dying and sick people you'll show that these non existent virus is killing people. </p>
<p>The west have turned to tyranny, and it is here to stay. There's no two more weeks. Two more months or after the summer. The goal is permanent monitoring, control and arbitrary rulemaking.</p>
