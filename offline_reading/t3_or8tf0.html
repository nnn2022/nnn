    <strong>Whyis everyone do upset?</strong>
    <p><p>NOT A TROLL, JUST CONFUSED</p>
<p>I have the vaccine, abide by the rules and have no problem with what's going on. I'm very confused by why everyone is protesting and refusing the rules.</p>
<p>Here is my perspective:</p>
<p>The vaccine is new and may have adverse side effects that are unknown however they seem to tend toward blood pressure related conditions and I keep myself fit and healthy so shouldn't struggle too much with that. In my opinion, it is safer for me to get the vaccine and protect those who really suffer from covid. As for the vaccine passports and the masks, they are just to protect people. You can still go shopping and go to the park with your friends. I get it of you don't want the vaccine right now but covid is still about and we need to keep the numbers down. It is only venues such as gigs and places where people are all crammed together that you require a passport to enter.</p>
<p>I know some wackos will want to yell at me saying covid rates are a lie or the vaccine is experimental gene therapy or something but please refrain. My mum works as a care assistant at a hospital and during the height of the pandemic had to deal with the hospital's being full. She had to watch 2 or 3 body bags being carried out her ward each day. Covid is dangerous and can fill hospitals. There were adults in the children hospital due to lack of space. Don't try to tell me covid isn't dangerous or anything like that. I know we're not that bad atm but I don't want us to get back there.</p>
<p>As for the gene therapy, just don't. Please just don't.</p>
<p>Anyone that understands my confusion, please explain why so many people are so confused? To me it seems like a rampant spread of fake news petrifying people into believing that covid isn't bad and the vaccine will kill you.</p></p>

        <p>No one here is angry because you got the jab.  It was your choice to do so.  All we want is the same opportunity to choose.  We don't want to be lied to, coerced or have children coerced into doing something that has risks outweighing the benefits.</p>
<p>As for lockdowns, studies have shown they didn't have any apprecable effect on spread, and they did a lot of harm.  They caused deaths and ruined lives.  I'd say that's reason enough to be upset.</p>

        <p>Idk about other places but in the UK and a lot of Europe, you only get the vaccine of you're 18+ and you register for it, you get a text when there's room to schedule you in to get it. I get that in the US the going house to house thing is weird but that's not here. It's very much a choice here. The only thing is that if you don't take the vaccine, you wait a bit to go clubbing and shit. </p>
<p>As for lockdowns, they only didn't work BC a bunch of people refused to follow the rules. In places like new Zealand and some Scandian countries, they had one lockdown and had covid under control. They then just had to make sure people coming into the country were safe. I get they sucked but they did slow the spread, just didn't manage to fully stop it in areas where people still socialised.</p>
<p>I just don't see how so many people can be so angry. I'd even say the UK needs to tighten it's restrictions, we've just opened everything up. But people are still protesting. I don't understand.</p>

<p>Didn't work for Germany and Italy, and people followed the rules there.  Also, you realize that not everyone can stay home and have things function.  Some people still have to go to work, like delivery people.  Lockdowns didn't work because quarantining well and healthy people doesn't affect spread because those people don't have virus to spread.</p>
<p>Sick people have symptoms which limit their activity.   Unless it's a cold.  This is infection control 101.</p>

        <p>Not exactly, you can have covid and have no symptoms. Some people are completely asymptomatic. They have no idea they have it. BD if you are someone like that and you don't follow the rules then you spread it to a bunch of other people. There is also sometimes a period where you have the virus and transmit it but it has not yet duplicated enough to give you any symptoms, especially so in healthy young people. As for people that had to leave, there were things in place such as masks, antibacterial gel and social distancing. Theoretically, they should work. Obviously they weren't as effective in some places as in others but the can work. Leaving everything open would've been worse. Much worse.</p>

<p>Which doesn't signifucantly stop the spread.  So, that argument falls flat.</p>
<p>&rt;Leaving everything open would've been worse. Much worse.</p>
<p>Prove it.</p>
<p>&rt;Some people are completely asymptomatic</p>
<p>That's called not having a disease.  There are zero studies that demonstrate direct person to person asymptomatic spread in anything resembling a controlled environrment.</p>
<p>This all feeds back into why people are upset.  They lost over a year of their lives.  Some died due to reduced access to medical care amd psychological stress.  They lost their jobs, businesses and homes, or got into cripplong debt to keep afloat.  They missed weddings, birthday parties, graduations, etc.  They were denied visitation with loved ones, with dying loved ones to boot!</p>
<p>All of this loss for measures that did absolutely nothing to help, measures that cost more lives than they saved.  They lost all of that for NOTHING.  If you still say you are confused, then you are a liar or completely lack empathy.</p>

        <p>If you use antibacterial on anything that is in contact, it will be effective. This could have worked. It only didn't because some people didn't follow the rules. That's it. Proof that no lockdown would've been worse: New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Iceland had less people interacting and a more successful lockdown. Thus had reduced numbers even with respect to total population. UK, US, France and such did not follow the rules. They all got together. The proof of that is everywhere people always posted on social media how little they respected the rules. And we had continued cases. That is proof that lockdowns work. And if you have a worse lockdown, you have more cases. Thus no lockdown is the maximum amount of cases. It's just basic. If you stay away from people and keep yourself away from any possible places you can catch covid, you won't catch or spread it. That's it.</p>
<p>I understand lockdowns were hard. I really do. I experienced it too. That's why I want it over. And that's only gonna happen if we get the cases down. This is nearly over. It's not time to be protesting. If you cared that much you should've organised these protests while lockdown was in effect or just before. It's done now. Whatever happens, you can't undo the lockdowns.</p>

        <p>So, your idea of proof that the lockdowns work is just you reatating your argument in different words.  Lockdowns work because in places with lockdowns people didn't follow the rules?</p>
<p>&rt;Thus no lockdown is the maximum amount of cases. It's just basic.</p>
<p>How does case count prove your arguement?  The vaccines don't prevent infection or transmission.  So, realistically the case count is going to eventually equal the population in any given area.  Pretty much the only way to not get a Covid infection is to have recovered from a Covid infection.</p>
<p>So, having all the low-risk people, the people mainly affected by the lockdowns, getting their minor form of the disease would have resulted in fewer cases and deaths among the high-risk groups, if we focused on protecting them.</p>
<p>You'd be getting rid of the major resevoir of infections.  So, there'd be fewer people who could pass it on to the high-risk groups.  You're right, it is basic.  Too bad your "proof" refuted your own argument.</p>

        <p>You're absolutely right! But it's much less likely. The virus is killed off incredibly quickly meaning you are unlikely to carry it around. It's still possible to say touch a railing with vivid on and wipe that on someone's face but hand sanitizer and stuff are in place for that. Personally, I'm still trying to distance from people and such. I know it's not 100% effective but I just want this all to end. I want to see my friends without people being hospitalised.</p>

        <p>These are not public events tho. It's as much unvaccinated being banned as poor people that can't afford a ticket being banned. You can still go shopping and go to the park and go to the gym or do whatever. You just can't go to live venues and travelling abroad might be more awkward because you're more likely to carry the virus.</p>

        <p>In the UK there's not anything set up yet for a vaccine passport or whatever, the unvaccinated can even go out clubbing rn. But in my opinion anything that you have to pay to enter is not public. It's a private venue hired out Tina select few who've payed to go. Now there are also rules regarding the safety with respect to the Corona virus.</p>

        <p>They are privately owned businesses imo. You can't just walk into a theatre, concert, lecture hall or hotel without having a ticket or being in the course. Also in the UK, there's nothing up yet regarding university. The idea is that most people will be vaccinated by then so it should be safe.</p>

        <p>No, the passport isn't here yet. And if cases kept reducing at the current rate, we wouldn't need it. You're just looking for an excuse to go get angry. That's why you did it yesterday in the cool breeze and not the day before in the heat or today in the rain. You don't give a fuck. You really think that this is all a big conspiracy to fuck over the people that won't get vaccinated it whatever the fuck? Well it's not and you know it. I came here looking for a reasonable answer and I've found one. You don't care. You're just looking for an excuse to get rowdy, same as the footballers. If you don't want to get vaccinated then that's your choice but you also need to accept that doing so makes you more likely to spread covid. If you can't accept that then that's your problem. We're all trying to stop this pandemic. Either get with it or get out of the way.</p>

        <p>&rt;however they seem to tend toward blood pressure related conditions and I keep myself fit and healthy so shouldn't struggle too much with that.</p>
<p>You survived X months without a vaxx and are now OK with with a lifetime's worth of heart issues? What kind of risk assessment is that!?  </p>
<p>&rt;and protect those who really suffer from covid.</p>
<p>Let me get this straight, the entire pandemic is predicated on the theory that asymptomatic spread is behind 80%+ of the cases...but you are recommending someone to get a vaxx that NEITHER prevents infection NOR transmission, BUT only REDUCES symptoms, thereby worsening the asymptomatic spread? Seriously, please spend time actually thinking critically about what people tell you, instead of simply parroting talking points that make zero sense.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;You can still go shopping</p>
<p>I am in Cyprus and we CANNOT go shopping sans vaxxport.  </p>
<p>&rt;My mum works as a care assistant at a hospital and during the height of the pandemic had to deal with the hospital's being full</p>
<p>If your mom is honest, she'll tell you the same things happens every year because of influenza, RSV, pneumonia and other respiratory illnesses. Hospitals always run with tiny allowances for additional demand.  </p>
<p>&rt;She had to watch 2 or 3 body bags being carried out her ward each day.</p>
<p>If you can state the country, province and county, we can absolutely verify this. You don't even need to supply the hospital system's name.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;As for the gene therapy, just don't. Please just don't.</p>
<p>According to you, what is "gene therapy?"</p>

        <p>Idk about zinc but Hydroxychloroquine takes around 12 weeks to take effect. Therefore you'd have to take it as a treatment all the time not just when you get symptoms. This has a bunch of side effects including hair loss, tinnitus and sight problems (versus arthritis.org/about-arthritis/treatments/drugs/hydroxychloroquine). This may be effective agaubs covid, idk. But it's not really a long term solution to covid and covid is a really contagious virus. The vaccine takes a couple weeks to work and may have some side effects but I think it's safer and so does the NHS. It's just a method of keeping people safe.</p>

        <p>People like you is why I was protesting yesterday and will continue to do so until we get a guarantee that covid passports will never be a thing. </p>
<p>The fact that you accept fascism so easily is scary. This is not a temporary situation, this is a forever situation if we let them. And guess what mate, we can gather in public as much as we want, just look at the London protests with tens and even hundreds of thousands of people, most unvaccinated.</p>

        <p>Nah that was shit as well. Why do so many people seem to think that gathering together like this is a good thing? The vaccine passports don't exist yet and they likely wouldn't so long as covid cases are reasonable. As well as this it would likely only be required as long as the owner of the establishment wants it. By keep meeting up in large groups like this, you're more likely to force the passports into play. More likely to start another lockdown. We just fucking got out of it. And here you are dragging us back in.</p>

<p>You also fail to realise just how fed up we all are on here. We are done with lockdowns, done with passports and done with any restrictions and will no longer tolerate this illegal breach of human rights. We are not scared of the gov anymore, they should be scared of us.</p>

        <p>Lockdowns have time and time again been proven ineffective, Masks have also been proven ineffective "Unless N95" and then only mostly effective.</p>
<p>It's what most see as "Government overreach" our own health has always been as it should be "Our Choice" hell Governments around the world can't keep their own houses in order let alone ours.</p>
<p>All Lockdown have managed to truly accomplish x5 the OD rate, x4 the suicide rate add a list of mental health problems that should not be, let alone the long term ramifications of displacing the social environment from our children ,making them social distance and wear masks. Allergists all over the world are seeing the consequences of long term masking, Or have you not noticed allergies are worse then ever this year.</p>
<p>74D \~ We were told outright, long term mask usage is dangerous, as it runs the risk of actually lowering your immune system. Humans need a compliment of Bacteria, Viruses and Allergens everyday to maintain a healthy immune system.</p>
<p>If I put you in a bubble with sterilized air for 1 year, then tore that bubble down, your immune system would be so heavily damaged likely the Common cold could run a risk of killing you.</p>
<p>Only thing these lockdown have truly managed to accomplish is "Making the poor poorer, making the middle class poorer, and making the super rich even more obnoxious.</p>
<p>And NOW the PCR test was pulled for being too Inaccurate, and confusing the Flu with Covid, now it looks more then ever total Gov't overreach.</p>
<p>Mandatory anything Via Gov't trashcan is BAD and likely Evil.</p>

        <p>I'm from the UK. We literally just opened everything back up. Everything is normal. We don't even have a vaccine passport yet and probably wouldn't if we can keep covid rates down. But now we have people gatheringg in masses to protest. But I don't understand what they are protesting. To me that are just asking for another lockdown with that many people all together.its so annoying because I've tried my hardest to abide by the rules. They act like I don't understand when this has been shitty for me too! I'm just trying to get through this. That's all. But now I guess it's gonna be extended. It's so annoying. I thought we'd finally made it. But I guess here we go again.</p>

        <p>Who is forcing you to get vaccinated? Who is arresting you or strapping you down? Noone. You've been told that if you don't get the vaccine then it's not safe for you to attend some stuff like festivals or gigs. So you can't go. Too bad. That's it. I get there's some weird door to door to see how many people are vaccinated thing in the US but that's not you being forced to do anything. You don't want to get vaccinated then don't. That's not a problem. But noone is forcing you.</p>

        <p>Yeah that purple line shows it at around 90% occupancy through the pandemic. Keep in mind too that covid wards had to be separated from regular wards. You needed to keep the sick people away from infected people, meaning you needed more space between. Sure it never quite reached every bed full but it git damn close and in order to fit in enough wards and keep people separated, the children's hospital was used to hold many of the sick who would've died should they catch the virus.</p>

        <p>I do see the irony. I just want to understand why people are protesting in the UK and similar countries, it doesn't make sense to me. The lockdown is over. You can chose to either get the vaccine it not. The lockdowns are likely over (tbh I can see one more coming since we opened up too early) so the protests feel a little late now.</p>

<p>and what it will eventually lead to as in France where if you do not get the "treatment" means you cant shop, eat in a cafe or restaraunt or catch a train. go a theatre , sports game, the cinema, get treated in hospital or catch a plane with an additional rumour that you will soon be excluded from voting</p>

        <p>Looks like the same story if you read the whole page.</p>
<p>&rt; In Q1 2020/21 (April to June 2020), the bed occupancy rate decreased sharply to 65%, after trusts were asked to pause non-urgent operations and discharge inpatients who were medically fit to leave to free up capacity during the Covid-19 pandemic.
&rt; 
&rt; ...
&rt; 
&rt; During the Covid-19 pandemic, hospital services were reorganised due to infection prevention and control measures, and the need to treat Covid and non-Covid patients separately. As a result, hospitals are likely to experience capacity pressures at lower overall occupancy rates than in previous years, so caution should be taken when comparing occupancy rates.</p>
<p>That lines up with the massive drop in elective procedures and increase in the need for specific personnel and equipment during the pandemic.</p>

        <p>there is a 0.004 percent chance of dying to covid if your healthy, and you can still get the virus after you get the vaccine, so its an unnecessary risk, and we hate the mandatory vaccines, it isnt the government's business what our medical history, vaccine mandates and the like violate our rights, and the vaccine has caused 8-11k injuries in the us, so no, it isnt misinformation, its people listening to the facts</p>

        <p>I believe that sin is killing way, way, way more people than Covid ever will. </p>
<p>Are you ready to confess? Are you ready to convert to a monastic lifestyle of purity and silence and the pursuit of God? Well, if not, too bad. I think society should make you do all those things because clearly sin is what causes death. "For the wages of sin is death", the Bible says. You shouldn't have the right to engage in sin or even advocate for it. You will either be holy and righteous or you will need to be killed to keep others safe because you might cause them to sin.</p>
<p>See how that works. You might say, well, I don't believe in the Bible and you can't make me. In the same way, I will say, well, I don't believe in Covid and you can't make me. Same, same.</p>
