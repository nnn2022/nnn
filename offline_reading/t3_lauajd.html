    <strong>Information on vaccines and mutations - have the mutations gotten significantly closer in terms of making the vaccines ineffective [any info from medical and/or hospital workers and experts would be great]?</strong>
    <p><p>I was wondering since there are reports of mutations and attempts to frighten us.  Michael Osterholm has advocated for up to 10 years of going in and out of lockdown due to mutations.  the implication is that the virus is genuinely clever, devious and insiduous and is outsmarting us and finding ways to get around vaccines as an attempt to keep the pandemic going longer than any other in history.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In light of that, the evidence seems to be that when it comes to feared recent mutations, vaccines work as well against the UK variant as earlier versions and nearly as well against the South African variant.  Are there any  mutations outside those two that show signs of outsmarting and/or working around vaccines so far?  Are there patterns that show the vrius has somehow in the past half a year changed systemically in a way as to make vaccines progressively less effective?  It would be grea tto know how much of it is valid and exactly how much of it is made up?</p></p>

        <p>It’s spike protein hasn’t changed much, a couple small variations that’s made it more virulent but nothing that’s been shown so far to render the vaccines less effective.</p>
<p>Mutations sound scary but they happen all the time with viruses, mainly because of the number of generations that they go through.</p>
<p>Time will tell if it mutates in a significant way.  Main reason I’ve advocated and harped for everyone to at least mitigate or try to slow the spread is we still don’t know how or why this virus attacks how it does, and we don’t know of it’s playbook for the future.</p>
<p>I don’t see news of mutations as fear mongering.  It’s a fact of virus evolution.</p>
