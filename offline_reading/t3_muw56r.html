    <strong>My personal experience</strong>
    <p><p>So far I’ve known 0 people that have had hospitalisation/long COVID, despite the fact that I have a close relationship with my grandparents and have asked about their friends (many over 82) and thankfully not one person has been mentioned. </p>
<p>On the other hand I know 2 people that have had terrible side effects from ‘vaccines’, one woman in her early thirties, hospitalised and in a coma, and another woman I know who is 23 has got all over skin rashes to the point where her hair has started to fall out. </p>
<p>I understand my experience is purely anecdotal, but it makes me wonder, do the oldies experience side effects but are on more medication and therefore don’t notice it, or does the mRNA effect the young more than the old? I don’t know but I thought I’d get my experiences of those around me out there and wondered what people’s take on it might be.</p></p>

        <p>There is a lot of evidence that they are overdosing the young people. With flu shots younger people get  a smaller dose, and its clear they should be doing the same with the Covid vax</p>

        <p>As you get older your immune response gets weaker.  The hearty immune response of a 20 year old is what causes a cytokine storm, which can be deadly.  Olds can't have that anymore because their body is winding down. I think middle aged your chances are less, too.</p>
<p>Also, young children still have a developing immune system, so their response is less hearty than an adult.</p>

        <p>Yeah I mean everyone’s experience is different, because everyone’s body is so different and unique. Yet they roll this gene therapy out regardless</p>
