    <strong>What will be their "next" move?</strong>
    <p><p>We all know a lot of people are awaking to Covid bs, but we all know they will use another "crisis" to push the same agenda once again. I will like to discuss what and when will that move will be.</p>
<p>Some of you, who look at various news resources, might notice there has been an increase in both "Climate Change" and "Forest Fire" articles. Most of these Forest fires happen in Turkey, Greece and Canada. Some foreigner news outlets has shown this events as "Natural causes of climate change". They aren't in the least bit. I live in Turkey and most of us saw others trying to set forests in fire secretly. There's video clips of some "terrorists" burning the forests. So i like to notice you a similarity between 3 countries i just said. All of them abuse their people for "New Normal". All of them push the NWO agenda. All of them has corruption in their cores rn. My "theory" is they are currently being paid to burn down forests. This might look weird but you will see what i am talking about at the end.</p>
<p>"When?" us the most important question. Even if they used money to make such a set-up, a pointless set-up would just be a money burner. My guess is Summer of next year. Why? Simple, they will push the nail(set-up), with a hammer. There will be more burning forests and they will probably be in Europe and America to make masses scared. Media will say this:</p>
<p>&rt; Last year's forest fires was a warning by nature but we didn't see it! This year there's more, so climate change must be the cause! You can't create more CO2 emissions so no more cars and transportation for you!(expect who they deem "essential) You need to live in your home! You nedd to eat bugs and not meat because meat production creates CO2!(While they will still use all factories at %100 and create CO2 masses with coals abd petrol) You need to live in smaller and compact rooms to make less CO2 cause warming up your home creates CO2!(They will live in mansions just like always)  Factories creates CO2 so you can't buy things anymore, you will rent them!(They will use factories to make efficiently more money. )</p>
<p>This is what i think about what will happen. They showed who "deny climate change" as "Idiotic conspiracy theorists". This was a set-up just like anti vaxxers. They are trying to make us the enemies of our kind. They are socially conditioning people so they can hate us with a burning passion. What will happen after this? Idk but one thing is certain. This will go crisis after crisis. Until we become manifestation of "Evil" in eyes of our families and get killed by our own kind, or show others light behind the curtains and escape from this everlasting cycle with ones dear to us.</p>
<p>What i said might look insane or not wise but let this stay somewhere in your mind. Maybe, maybe we might remember this in the future.</p></p>

        <p>Similar to the floodings here in Germany. Usually there is a system to prevent strong rivers by opening gates to release water into uninhabited zones. But this time they didn't. The rain wasn't stronger then usual. Also the population wasn't warned: no sirens, no broadcasting, nothing. Many people died. And now they blame climate change and everybody believes it. Clown world everywhere.</p>

        <p>The climate change has been non stop on UK media this week. It's as if forest fires never happened in hot countries before, or floods in flood prone regions?</p>
<p>Ive always known the news and the official narrative was likely bullshit generally, but after the crap they are pulling with Covid, literally EVERYTHING from now on from any 'official' government or big media source is an outright lie as far as I am concerned.</p>
<p>The cats out of the fucking bag, and the evil liars can just fuck off.</p>
