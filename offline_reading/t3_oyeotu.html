    <strong>Do you still think the virus was bat soup that caused all this chaos?</strong>
    <p><p>You’d think people would open their eyes and realize this was a well thought out developed design to divide and conquer. To strip away our freedoms and encourage to question our truths and abolish critical thought. </p>
<p>In fact, remember in the beginning when China couldn’t even keep their Covid death statistics straight? Something was up from the beginning. This was no a coincidence. Then the lies just kept coming and coming and somehow we are just supposed to get used to it and ignore it; no more!</p></p>
