    <strong>Societal Collapse</strong>
    <p><p>With all the cesspool worthy conversations all over Reddit about wishing death to unvaccinated individuals, hoping they are denied ALL medical insurance, etc, I have reached a point at which I despise the existence of truly pro-vaccine people, and more generally people that I “disagree” with on a wider scale.  After being bombarded with hatred from the media and those who disagree with me on a broader scale, I’ve reached a point of sincere hatred for them in return.  To the point where I am almost foaming at the mouth at the thought of them getting severe life altering side effects. Not to say I <em>hope</em> everyone develops issues, but I would certainly consider it karma for those who are so keen on damning those who are skeptical with good reason.  Something about seeing the look in their eyes as they are stuck in their own mind as their prions go to waste, doomed to slowly decay as the last cohesive thought that goes through their head is “I wish I never took this vaccine” would make me feel vindicated.  And this is when I realized the new normal is already here and will always be here.  Covid could disappear tomorrow and the hatred for those who did not comply will still stand.  There will always be another crisis to vilify “the other side.”</p>
<p>The saddest part of this epidemic isn’t the deaths, economic toll, etc, it’s the complete and utter destruction of western society.  From the artificial pushing of racial tensions, left vs right politics, and now vaccinated vs unvaccinated, the last 2 years have made me a noticeably bitter human and incapable of being open minded to differences, and I know I’m not the only one who feels this way.  I guess this was the true end goal of everything, to erode society from the inside out.  I wish I could say I am the better man and would be able to put aside my own convictions for the greater good of society as a whole but I know deep down I want them to suffer.</p></p>

        <p>I understand that you are frustrated. But it is not a healthy state of mind to harbor such anger and resentment even to those who so blatantly violate your well-being. Please do your best to find a beneficial way to vent your frustrations in a productive manner. Your success will be the best revenge. It will be better for you not only now but also in the long run. Good luck and stay well my friend.</p>
