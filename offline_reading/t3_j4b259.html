        <p>SS: the symptoms of mass hysteria can include headache, dizziness, nausea, abdominal pain, cough, fatigue, sore throat. <em>Edit 30m later: those match up with the burden of chronic stress</em></p>
<p>Seems pertinent to the vagueness of some positive cases, especially in the young. Coupled with shortness of breath as one symptom of anxiety and panic attacks.</p>
<p>Is everyone developing a low key PTSD?</p>

        <p>I am 100%. And I’m not sure it’s low key. I had to quit my job before all this started because the stress was causing all those symptoms. Spent thousands of dollars on medical testing to find out what was wrong with me because I was convinced I was dying. After everything was normal, doctors came to the conclusion it was work related stress and recommended I quit working. Low and behold, all symptoms went away the minute I left that building for the last time. </p>
<p>As soon as all this started and the first 2 weeks went by, all of it came back but way worse. But for me, and I suspect many people, that’s being caused by the lockdowns and mandates - not by fear of a very mild virus. For the doomers, it is fear of a super mild virus because they don’t know how to think for themselves and they believe anything the media says. So whether you think we’re overreacting or under reacting, I think most people feel like absolute shit. It’s just that the doomers don’t care about people who feel like shit and are actually dying from the lockdowns and mandates because the politically and financially motivated “scientists” are on their side.</p>

        <p>Well thought out point!<br>
Lockdowns are significantly worse than a mild virus. 
Potentially lose an elderly family member or two..
Vs. 
You and everyone you love giving up all their freedom to live on their knees for the rest of their lives.  No barbecues or sports allowed ever again!!! Lol. </p>
<p>What a great trade off.  Our grandchildren will thank us lol</p>

        <p>I was thinking about this last night, too. We’re clearly in the midst of a mass hysteria event as far as how people are behaving. But a mass hysteria event as in psychogenic illness presenting as virus symptoms would definitely not surprise me. It’s happened so many times throughout history, why not now? </p>
<p>On the opposite end of this, but similar, there has been a phenomenon happening in the last 20 years or so of the placebo effect getting stronger. I am not implying that it’s related at all to what’s going on now, but it reminded me of this and how curious it is! An interesting read:

        <p>A detachment and alienation from our natural instincts and living in nature? Phobias that were meant to respond to lions in the bushes and social games meant for seeing who had the most food.

        <p>Basically every Buddhist teaching I listen to describes Western culture in this way, essentially stating that our comfort and convenience has made us weaker, not only physically but also mentally.</p>

        <p>For sure! Buddhism has helped me through a lot of this. The local Nun just kind of comments how weird it is. Buddhism has endured thousands of years of human BS and endured just the same.
Life is good regardless of the externals :)</p>

        <p>I knew a Buddhist with SGI who completely bought into the propaganda. She unfriended me on FB because I kinda mocked her fear mongering. She was all like, " I can clearly tell you haven't been chanting you have a bad attitude." 
In my head I was like, "Woman I manifested everything I needed I don't need to chant for anything other than peace of mind and all the hysteria won't help make that happen, lol"</p>

        <p>Id never heard about this before except for like the 15th century dancing hysteria’s but many of these do seem to coincide with what’s being experienced now. That’s wild.</p>
