    <strong>The FDA and Pfizer are not to be trusted</strong>
    <p><p>I don't care how vaccines work. I don't care about "tHe ScIeNcE" behind them. I don't care if mRNA is an amazing new technology that allows you to build up immunity without being introduced to the virus. <strong>I don't care because I don't trust the people who created the shot, or the people disseminating the information about it.</strong> Vaccines *may* be safe and effective against viruses in theory, but I don't believe what's in it is what they say is in it.</p>
<p>This is because I have first hand experience with this. I was poisoned by a pharmaceutical that disabled me and ruined my life. They told me it was safe. They told me it would never happen to me, and when it did they denied it was the drug and blamed me for it.</p>
<p>So no, I'm not taking your jab. Biden can do his "information campaign to combat vaccine skepticism". The harder you try the more you push the skeptics further away. If Covid was so dangerous, and the vaccine was so effective, you wouldn't need a PR campaign as we'd be fighting each other in pharmacies like the movie Contagion.</p>
<p><strong>I do not consent, Joe.</strong> Get it trending.</p></p>

        <p>There are stray dogs I trust more than Joe Biden and the FDA. I’m not saying vaccines don’t work in theory, I’m just wondering what could go wrong, if there were to be any type of malfeasance or nefarious intervention at any point of the process we could be in for some seriously interesting times.</p>

        <p>Pfizer also gave untested treatment to African children in the 90's that killed 10/100 of those who got it, leaving some others with life time illness.</p>
<p>The disease Pfizer was trying to treat already had a safe medicine so it was not necessary.</p>

<p>They paid a ridiculously low amount to settle, it was easy as it was only Nigeria. So now they are not liable because how would they pay the damages to everyone with the consequences of the jab in the whole damned world.</p>

        <p>If they don't have enough data to convince people that it's safe and effective, they should get more data, and prove their point.  Instead, they are focused on the psychological aspects of convincing the hesitant through coercive manipulation.</p>
<p>Just convince me with the data!  I'm not interested in being brainwashed to disabuse me of the relevant questions I have that the scientists can't or won't answer.</p>

        <p>Yea. I've seen a video directed to the black community who is reluctant to take the injectable (for an obviously good reason). The video was 5 or 6 black or brown doctors, not experts, but like GPs or gynaecologists or whatever, saying "trust me, it's safe". You must have seen it too, I got the link from here or circlejerk or some sub like that. Laughable really.</p>

        <p>Truth. Drug companies are the sketchiest bunch of corrupt mafia-like thugs, only a truly naive person trusts them. They're snake-oil salesmen at best, cold-blooded murderers at worst. Look at the opioid epidemic for goodness sake!</p>
<p>Pro vaccine people are simply ignorant. They act like the Polio vaccine, for example, was some great thing even though we now know that it was contaminated with SV-40, a cancer-causing agent.</p>

        <p>I will disagree slightly in that the "opioid epidemic" is highly overblown. 45,000 overdoses a year in a country of 330 million is not an epidemic.</p>
<p>Opioids work, they are cheap, and come with relatively few side effects. They should be given to people who report pain because prohibition only makes it worse (they will get their hands on painkillers somehow, and those are often laced with heroin or fentanyl.)</p>
<p>When I was poisoned by an antibiotic that ripped my tendons apart, I sought out opioids for the chronic pain it caused me. For 4 months, I was denied and treated like a dope fiend until I finally found a doctor willing to help. And they do help.</p>
<p>Point is, one of the few things Big Pharma got right, they turned around and did a complete 180 once opioids got some bad PR and pulled millions of people off their pain meds. Now they throw ineffective trash like gabapentin and muscle relaxers at people and label them drug seekers.</p>
<p>But I get your point. I literally need the opioids because of another pharmaceutical, which is absolutely despicable. I was a healthy man reeled into a for profit system for sinister, evil motives.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry to hear about your experience and certainly don't begrudge you of any comfort you get from painkillers. It should just be like the old days where you could buy whatever drugs you want or need at the apothecary, no questions asked. People smoked opium and whatnot for their pain, but they didn't have hordes of addicts running around, robbing people's houses and the like. </p>
<p>These drug companies and quack doctors are posing as our saviors when they've harmed and killed countless millions of people. It's sounds kooky, but I overcame a terrible health problem through fasting and have never had a relapse or fasted again. Best of luck to you.</p>

        <p>The problem is they couldn’t force religious things on people for control because you can say “I don’t believe” </p>
<p>The big problem is you can’t say that apparently toward science because it supposed to be fact. Even though most we deem as facts are actually labelled technically as theories.</p>

        <p>The drug that disabled me, a perfectly healthy 31 year old man, was “safe and effective” too. When I reported my results to the doctors, they refused to attribute to the drug and wouldn’t report to the FDA. When you control the notes, you can keep the ADRs to a vaccine looking as “rare” as you want. We’ve seen cases of people dying of “natural causes” WHILE STILL AT THE VENUE OF THE VACCINE ADMINISTRATION. So no, I don’t trust your systems</p>

        <p>This type has been unsuccessful for years and never moved to human trials.. </p>
<p>No, and that’s why the flu vaccine is borderline ineffective because it uses the prior years strain... flu vaccine is a terrible argument. </p>
<p>The only age group that covid severely negatively effects was heavily underrepresented in these trials so I would not consider that to be well done... </p>
<p>If anything you were saying were true then animal trials wouldn’t have been bypassed and the vaccine would probably be FDA approved. I hope you are not forcing your very flawed understanding on others because it’s not appropriate.</p>

        <p>So, why don’t you trust the FDA?  Does that mistrust also extend to the FAA or the DOT?  </p>
<p>While I wouldn’t claim regulatory agency’s sniff out every problem. The Standards set by the FDA are pretty high.  They’ve really moved us forward in terms of food and drug safety. It’s actually worked too well, because people don’t realize how horrible things were before these regulatory bodies were formed. </p>
<p>Are vaccines 100% safe?  Of course not.  But reasonable care has been taken to minimize issues. </p>
<p>Humans are so different it’s hard to discover a compound that someone won’t over react to. </p>
<p>Just look at allergies. I just grabbed a handful of peanuts and am perfectly fine. But they could kill someone else. And I don’t see anyone claiming that peanuts should be pulled from the market. Or that the FDA failed to provide sufficient warning on the package. </p>
<p>Some folks are really out there.</p>
