        <p>If the business that I choose to enter requires me to wear one, then it remains my choice if I want to shop there or not. I have worn a mask at any business that required me to wear one because the inconvience of wearing one didnt outweigh the inconvience of finding a different store that didnt require them.</p>
<p>But it is wholly different to force everyone to wear a mask and force businesses into effectively become pseudo-police through fiat. It incentivizes others to rat on each other because once it becomes law, those citizens now see it as their civic duty to rat on someone not wearing a mask.</p>
<p>Things get to terrible places one tiny step at a time because there arent enough people willing to speak out.
Check out the Overton window if you havent heard of it. Its easy to shift the Overton window during a crises, people are fearful and looking to the government to solve their problems rather than looking to themselves.</p>
<p>My aversion to wearing a mask has next to nothing to do with the wearing of the mask and everything to do with protecting individual liberty. When people are upset saying its just a minor inconvienence, I agree thats true of most people, but thats not the point.</p>
<p>Im not suggesting were going to be living in a totalitarian state in the next year or 5 years, but we need to speak out against infringements on individual liberty if we want to remain free 20 or 30 years from now.</p>
