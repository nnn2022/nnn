        <p>I just wanted to share this.   All the trusted brands of hand sanitizers are sold out, and clearly some sketchy ones are in US shops.   I saw a whole bunch of weird off brand sanitizers, no purell or anything but they look cheap and unknown brands; tried one and all it did was make my hands sticky so I trashed it.   </p>
<p>The media has people in hysterics and all the hand sanitizer sold out, and now some people could get hurt from buying the sketchy ones that the media insisted everyone NEEDS, even though hand washing with hot water and soap is completely effective.</p>
<p>Be careful out there.</p>
