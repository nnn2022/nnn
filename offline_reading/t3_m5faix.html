        <p>You know, I've read that in simulations of herd movement, it only takes 2% of the population being redirected to change the direction of the entire herd. That's anecdotal, and perhaps means nothing to you. Fine. But it leads me to wonder, why don't these view points have much traction? Why is the battle you fight against oppressive false science so uphill? If I am open-minded, and admittedly maybe I am not, why am I so difficult to convince? If you are able to pretend for a moment that I am undecided about all this, I would ask that you do me one favor. Could you share with me the source or sources of information that were so convincing to you? Why do you disbelieve that this pandemic is so deadly as to require such public health measures as have been put in place (in you country or any other)? I truly want to understand.</p>

        <p>I think you have long since been alleviated of the burdensome privilege of independent thought. You probably sit in front of the tv each night waiting for Fauci to tell you if it’s ok to go outside, to go to work. </p>
<p>It’s ok, though, if you have to go outside just riot in the name of perceived social injustices as you’re exempt from getting or spreading the “deadly virus” in these cases. Need food? Then please shop at the pre approved businesses. As everyone knows it’s impossible to get covid while shopping at Walmart, but you will surely die from entering a local business, Church or gym. </p>
<p>You people are such clowns. If, you want evidence that this isn’t a real pandemic, then you have to look no further than your front door. Maybe you have all been touched by the Patron Goddess of Ignorance, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and can no longer discern reality from fantasy.</p>

        <p>My grandad died of flu in December 2018. I was sad but I accepted that’s what happens to everyone when they get old.</p>
<p>I didn’t call anyone selfish, I didn’t want to track down the person who infected him and shame then on social media - even though they presumably left the house while feeling ill and infected others. I didn’t tell anyone to wear a mask or demand anyone shut their business to try to prevent other people from also dying the way he did.</p>

        <p>Our herd is being thinned <em>ever so slightly</em> (check my math in the title) and it's pretty much <strong>the</strong> most vulnerable who are succumbing.  I'm not insensitive, but I'm delighted that it's not affecting the young and healthy for the most part, and especially the children. Perhaps people will become more aware of overall health; we have a <em>huge</em> obesity problem here in America.  Perhaps people will eat right, drink less, exercise more and on and on.  And perhaps people who are exhibiting symptoms will not only be more likely to stay away from other people during that time, but will also not be punished for doing so whether by their employer or school or whatever.  <em>These</em> things would be good for the overall health of society in my opinion, but instead healthy people are being forced to block their airway and not socialize.  My mom died in July, in a nursing home from dementia, alone.  We were not allowed to visit her.  We were told she had lucid moments every day though, so I can't help but think she wondered why her family abandoned her.  Death often is painful, but that's the way of the world.  She deserved to be comforted by her family though, yet we were all denied that.</p>
<p>Again, it's a <strong>tiny</strong> percentage of people who die from this thing; <em>that's</em> the credible information I present to you.</p>

        <p>Let me be clear: please show evidence, or your argument will be considered completely unfounded. I don't expect everyone to be an expert, but I do expect that someone so opinionated must have seen or read something extremely convincing. There are LOTS of public health measures in place to combat obesity, so I'm confused about what point you are making there. Are you suggesting that the war against untimely death can't be fought in multiple theatres? Look, all I want to see is a link to a published paper. For example, I consider https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ to be an excellent source of scientific literature. Perhaps there is something you know of that I can read that disproves the efficacy of mask wearing during this pandemic.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">Here</a> is my evidence.  2,672,010 deaths.  Let's round it up to 3 million.  No, let's round it up to <em>10</em> million.  Out of a population of over 7.8 <em>Billion</em>.  A <strong>tiny</strong> percentage of people succumb, and pretty much only <strong>the</strong> most vulnerable, which I'm sure you know.  And yet we've turned the world upside down because of it.</p>
<p>If that doesn't sway you then nothing I can say will.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

        <p>You keep bolding "tiny," but that doesn't really make the word any more effective. You have a subjective understanding of statistics, I get that. If you truly don't think that 2.6 million deaths in one year from a novel virus is nothing to be concerned about, you are probably correct to think that we're at an impass. But the world is bigger than you and your evaluation of other people's health. It looks like public health and vaccination are moving us toward some facsimile of "old normal," and that will apparently have to be achieved without your help. In any case, here's a good example of a scientific paper: https://scholar.google.com.au/scholar?q=clinical+study+mask+efficacy+covid+19&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholart#d=gs_qabs&amp;u=%23p%3DgbMKjS4ol-EJ</p>
<p>Be good to yourself and others.</p>

        <p>You know people have been dying from respiratory viruses for forever.  But I doubt you know how many because you've never considered it before.  And you likely didn't give a hoot about <em>any</em> of them unless you knew them personally.  Suddenly you care about all these lost lives, and don't really like hearing about what a tiny (better?) percentage of the population it is and the fact that luckily in this case it's pretty much only the most vulnerable among us.  In fact I don't think you care about any other disease these days.  I don't think you spend much time thinking about the millions who starve to death every year or the millions who don't have fresh water to drink, every day of their lives.  I don't think you spend much time worried about all of the homeless people either, it probably crosses your mind from time to time, but you don't want to turn the world upside down because of it.  No, it's only C-19 that feels so important to people like you.  I find that fascinating.</p>
<p>Edit:  I <em>do</em> help with public health; always have and always will.  I stay home when I'm sick.</p>
