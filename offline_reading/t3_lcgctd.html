    <strong>Got kicked out a store for not wearing a mask</strong>
    <p><p>Ok so for context I live in the UK which has become the worst places to live in terms of covid laws and all the stores have put up bouncers at the entrance to ensure you have a mask. I bucked up the courage and went in without a mask and as I expected I got stopped and got told I had to wear a mask. I kept my cool and explained that theirs no reason for me to when it has 99.8 percent death rate and claimed I don't have it myself. The bouncer kept saying "Its policy" until eventually he went to go get the manager and he threatened to call the police since I was making a scene at the entrance. I sadly buckled under the pressure because I'm poor and didn't want to get fined.</p>
<p>I've had it up to here with this draconian country but I have failed this subreddit as I sadly complied to their horrible rules and for that I'm sorry to this sub.</p></p>
