    <strong>Do I have a case here?</strong>
    <p><p>Hi friends!</p>
<p>So I’m wondering.. I work for a major retailer. Won’t mention who just out of privacy concerns. But with the news of these new mask guidelines, I’m going to assume that my company will let vaccinated employees take their masks off if they wish.</p>
<p>I’m not getting vaccinated. But I’m wondering if they have the right to tell me that I have to keep my mask on because I’m not taking the jab. That seems pretty discriminatory to me. Anyone have any insight on this? I need to keep my job, but I’m tired of this mask bullshit.</p></p>

        <p>They can say whatever they want.</p>
<p>What you stand on is this - do they compel you to produce proof of "vaccination" or health records documenting that you have previously had the virus and have antibodies / T cell response?  </p>
<p>If so, that is against the law.  </p>
<p>No one is going around asking about your hiv / aids status.  </p>
<p>If a person is healthy they should be able to go to work no questions asked.  </p>
<p>This fiasco of caution and fear based policy is beyond ridiculous.</p>

        <p>What about certain state governments that want businesses to verify vaccine status (Oregon).  I'm hoping businesses take the approach of "If you enter this establishment then you verify you've been vaxxed".   Otherwise, it sounds like vaccine passports are definitely coming for some states.</p>

        <p>It’s utter insanity tbh. They’ve never asked for proof of other vaccinations I’ve received. I did the antibody test not that long ago (someone wanted to practice on me), and I didn’t have antibodies. I also tested last week and was negative.</p>
<p>I’m hoping that it’s similar to Walmart, where it’s a “yes or no” question and it ends there.</p>

        <p>Does your place have an HR department? I would email them anonymously by creating a new gmail/outlook/yahoo email address, and ask them straight out what are your rights at work regarding this issue. </p>
<p>If there's someone you actually trust in management or HR, then ask them straight to their face, in private of course, with no one eavesdropping. </p>
<p>Or I'm sure you can dm someone from one of several "free legal advice" subreddits here on Reddit, and ask them in private about what their opinion is. You'll be able to tell who's a lawyer or someone with legal experience by just looking at those who've replied to others with advice. And depending on where you live, try searching for a legal advice one based on your State (for example "r/NewHamshireLegalAdvice", I just made this up). The reason for private dm'ing as opposed to posting your question is that it helps protect you, but if you don't get any answers then I suppose as a last resort you can post your question, similar to how you've done it here. </p>
<p>Any chance you talk to any close trusted friends, siblings, parents or relatives? There's got to be someone close to you in real life that you can talk to about this, right? Finally, trust your heart and your gut feeling. We all have a sixth sense, so trust in it. Good luck to you.</p>

        <p>Ironically, my cousin is a lawyer. However, he’s pretty Democratic and I’m sure that he’d freak out on me if I even touched on the subject. My company hasn’t announced anything yet, but I’m trying to prepare for when they do. </p>
<p>My direct manager also received the vaccine. I’m pretty sure he’s conservative, but he’s very pro-jab. My friends and family are on the same page as I am, but none of them have true legal experience and I’m not sure their advice would help unfortunately.</p>

        <p>I'm in the same boat, as most of upper and middle management have all gotten it, and several have admitted to getting severe reactions, but those fucking assholes all boasted how they "manned up" and "took it like a champ". Fucking imbeciles. This is why I want to sleep and never wake-up ever again in this god damn forsaken world (if you catch my drift).</p>
<p>I'm also having issues with relatives and some family members regarding my position of not getting vaxxed. I was told I'm a menace to society if I don't take it. I'm very depressed by being isolated and shamed by my relatives and family. </p>
<p>I guess it wouldn't be a good idea to ask your cousin, so maybe try one of the suggestions I gave above. I looked into HIPAA, but I can't find any language in there to protect people from private businesses. I'm sorry, I hope you don't have to take it. I've seen too much death and suffering from these shots. We shouldn't play with our lives with Russian Roulette. Good luck to you!</p>

        <p>Lord Fauci came out yesterday and said that the unvaccinated are not a threat to the vaccinated, so I’m just not sure why we’re still playing this game.</p>
<p>I feel that when my company does announce that the masks can come off, they’ll include everyone. They’re just opening themselves up to a whirlwind of shit if they don’t. No one can force me to do anything. It’s ridiculous. I always ask my co-workers who’ve taken the vaccine if they’re uncomfortable with me not wearing a mask and no one ever has an issue with it. I’m more concerned about my Karen customers coming after me.</p>
<p>I’m sending you good vibes, we’re in this fight together.</p>

        <p>I have a similar problem with school. Where I live, I'm considered that wont let me go back to school next year if I dont get the vaccine. I hate masks, and I refuse to get the vaccine for many different reasons, including fertility for the future. If you are concerned for that purpose you could try explaining that to them. But all we can really do in these situations, is pray for the people making the rules, and hope that they will begin to see reason</p>

        <p>I’ve been worried about masks becoming a “scarlet letter” so to speak for a while if places start demanding you wear one only if you can’t show proof of the vaccine. It would be crazy if the narrative completely flipped in that way. Hopefully it won’t happen</p>

        <p>I know it’s not the news this sub wants to hear, but there’s a pretty strong legal consensus that your employer can ask and even demand proof of what vaccines you’ve taken. Just Google it-there are tons of articles on this, all coming to the same conclusion.</p>
