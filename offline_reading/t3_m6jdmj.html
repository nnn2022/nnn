    <strong>Never forget what the government took from you</strong>
    <p><p>Since “15 days to slow the spread” is now a year old, take some time to take stock in what the government took from you. While I know my losses are nothing compared to the many who have lost jobs and health, im sure we all can attest to what has been stolen from us. </p>
<p>I lost my last three semesters of a college experience. I had to take my capstone course online from an 80 year old professor teaching from chicken scratch notes, spending at least 15 minutes a day not understanding how to use Zoom. It’s the only B I got in college. I had to go through my job interview process without getting to meet anyone in person or tour any offices. I still haven’t seen my future office or met any of my future coworkers in person. My life has been nuked socially. No parties and bars at limited capacity and hours. I grinded like crazy my first few years so I could take it easy and have fun as a senior. Fuck me right? The university enforces covid guidelines even for those living off campus. Meaning if my neighbors wanted to rat on me for having a few friends over, the uni could drop the hammer for breaking the guidelines. No spring break. No football games to attend in the fall. A student section that should hold 1500 only allowing 100 for basketball games making it not even worth it to try. I get two tickets for guests to come for my graduation that I’m sure I’ll have to wear a mask and social distance for. Yet they tell me I’m supposed to feel lucky that I even get to have one. My job doesn’t start until November so I had been saving to go backpacking in Europe after I graduate as this will be the last time I could realistically have the chance to do that. Every day it looks less and less likely that I’ll be able to go due to travel restrictions.</p>
<p>Even people have changed. Friends who used to be around all the time have gotten complacent being anti social. I realized just how many people I care for are comfortable not questioning this twisted reality. I don’t understand why more of my peers aren’t as incensed as I am. My university is going through the process of rolling out vaccines to student workers and I see Snapchat stories of people literally crying because they’re so happy they don’t have to be afraid of COVID anymore. It blows my mind how they allowed themselves to get so scared in the first place of a virus that just simply isn’t close to life threatening to our age group. Even the little shit is driving me fucking nuts. I miss smiling at people I pass on the mall or talking to strangers in line at the coffee shop. I miss not being avoided like the plague because I have seasonal allergies that make me cough. It’s dehumanizing by design. People are afraid of eachother more than ever. I got in an argument with someone who said we should never great others by shaking hands again. It’s like March 2020 happened and all these people forgot about the billions of years of evolution that brought about the human immune system. So much for “In this house, we believe in science.” This shit is insane and I can’t believe it’s been a whole year of it.</p>
<p>I don’t think this is all a deep state conspiracy, but I think it’s evident that it is about control. Politicians like Cuomo get huge boners being able to self righteously cast orders to the masses as they grovel in fear. I’d always disliked government, but now I have a legitimate reason to never trust it again. I have one life to live and I’ll never forget what was stolen from me in the name of “science”. If they would use any sort of standard science that didn’t have moving goalposts every other week, I wouldn’t be bitching. Don’t get me wrong, my life is not bad by any stretch. I’ve made the most of what I’ve been given. But over the last year the reality we have been living with these restrictions has been “give a little, they take a mile” and I am fucking over it. The goalposts will not stop being moved until we make our voices heard. </p>
<p>You can fuck right off if you tell me we need masks after vaccination. You can fuck right off if you want more lockdowns that have no basis in empirical fact and cause significant economic and psychological trauma. Not that I want to make this a rallying cry, but there’s no one on the planet I’d love to shake hands with more than DeSantis. His unwavering leadership and fearless reaction to the waves of crisis actors has been a saving grace. I only wish I liked warm weather more, cause I’d be a Florida resident. I hope we get more unflinching leaders like him that won’t kowtow to the mob.</p>
<p>My final thoughts are this: There will always be those that try and take your liberty. Even those that are unwilling to fight for their own deserve what only God gave them. There must always be those that are willing to fight for us all, just as the founding fathers did and the many men and women that have followed in their footsteps. I’ll never get what I lost back, and neither will you. But we can keep ourselves from losing more, and more importantly, keep others from losing what we have. We must fight for what is right for no other reason than the fact that it is indeed right.</p>
<p>TL;Dr: I lost some of my most formative years and social experiences thanks to the ineffective government and the power hungry politicians that run it. Be a part of the solution, not the problem.</p></p>

        <p>It is a dystopian movie. Seeing people with covered faces just out in public, as if it's normal and sane, and people thinking they have the right to force it on you, to force you to change your way of life to accommodate theirs. It's sick.</p>

        <p>I remember in middle and high school, we read lots of dystopian novels for the purpose of teaching us that this could happen, and we need to stand up and not let it. We read all these things and were taught about the dangers of large government. Now, I'm pretty sure some if not all of those same teachers are all face diapered for the greater good.</p>

        <p>Lots of petitions and voting for the right people would be my first choice. Now that I think about it, it was kind of surprising that they taught that. I was in middle and high school only a few years ago, and I went to a fairly liberal school. Stressed gun violence and racism. But they did make it a point that we are the future and it's important for us to understand corruption because it could lead to something like the books, and in my opinion, it already has.</p>

        <p>Also, the stuff that we read was great and really can be applied at least to some degree to today. I would recommend all of them. If you're curious, from what I remember, we read the Hunger Games trilogy, Unwind, The Maze Runner, 1984, Diary of Anne Frank, Animal Farm, Fahrenheit 451, and the Matched trilogy. Also, some short stories were The Lottery (applicable because of mob mentality) and Harrison Bergeron.</p>

        <p>Yep, right now I think it's similar to Harrison Bergeron, or Matched. In Matched, if I remember correctly, the Society gives people everything and they have to wear the same brown clothes, and the Society gives them a job and a partner, little free time, and only a few "choices" to make people feel like they're still in control of something. If someone defies, they are made a slave to the government (as if they weren't already). They don't have anything nice, just bland food and nothing special. No one can stand out and everything is limited. 100 approved paintings that people are allowed to look at, 100 approved songs that people can listen to, etc. And this right now, telling people that they have to wear a dehumanizing muzzle and be antisocial in the name of public health? It's not safety, it's hypochondria and dystopia.</p>

        <p>I'm not one that believes the last year has been a well thought out conspiracy. I think the reason why things have happened is because of mass hysteria. Once one of our leaders went hysterical the rest did. Remember, none of the western world dreamed of locking down until Italy did.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that some governments have recognized they can take advantage of the virus situation. However, at the end of the day I believe the people's willingness to be subjugated because of fear and hysteria has led to what we are currently seeing.</p>

        <p>Yes, exactly what I think. I think lots of people are just really gullible. I don't think this was all planned out or that there's some conspiracy. I just think leaders are power-hungry and saw this as an opportunity to scare people and people just went along with it because they got scared. If they would say outright "We're doing this for a year" I think even the pro-lockdowners would have said no way.</p>

        <p>Seeing that it's a year since "15 days", I ran some numbers on how much time we've lost collectively, and the result is sobering. With 320 million Americans having a year of their lives stolen, that's a total of almost 4 million life-years. We're two-thirds of the way to a Holocaust's worth of lost lifetimes, and that's not even counting the deaths of despair and the long-term effects. Never stop reminding yourself that what is being done to us is <em>pure unadulterated evil</em>, and TPTB hold us in the utmost contempt for daring to even notice.</p>
<p>I'd say "I hope the people responsible pay for their crimes against humanity", but realistically, we know that's not going to happen. They'll make Cuomo or someone like him into a sacrificial lamb and the rest will get off scot free, ready to visit a fresh new hell upon us again in a few years. At best we can hope that Fauci, being 80+ years old already, drops dead before he can take advantage of the next plandemic to get his next hit of 15-minute fame... but there will always be another power-hungry vermin to take his place.</p>

        <p>Second paragraph hits home cause it’s unfolding before our eyes. The fact that no one is really addressing how quick everyone was to dump Cuomo is baffling. They washed his balls for a whole fucking year. Now he’s cast to the side and no ones questioning why he was put on a pedestal in the first place? It’s all a game to the elites. All they want is to further stuff their already overflowing pockets and stroke their already gratuitously oversized egos. They couldn’t give a damn about the peoples lives they ruin in the process.</p>

<p>Could not have find a better word for politicians. I have a lot to do with carreer politicians due to my job and I often talk to them off camera. They are always ready to stab their closest allies in the back, use every opportunity to push others into the dirt and all share one favorite word: "I" (and all its derivations). The same people that look friendly and sympathetic on camera are outright frightening when the cameras are turned off. Do you know this erie feeling you sometimes get towards people, because their eyes are cold even though they are smiling? This creepy stone age sensation that tells you "there is a predator nearby"? I have yet to meet a carreer politician that does not give me this feeling. </p>
<p>TLDR: We are run by a gang of sociopaths.</p>

        <p>Luckily I’m in fairly red territory and in business school so my professors are all pretty level headed. But it’s still heavily a pre-health student body so the amount of “you’re literally killing my grandma” was really high last year. Once they got vaxxed through the school the nursing students all forgot about that though.</p>

        <p>It's seriously depressing. I've lost my junior year of college. Haven't seen the inside of a gym since March of 2020. Was working on getting out there and being more outgoing and just starting to get my life back on track and then this bullshit comes along and ruins everything, making me back into a shut-in.</p>
<p>I have friends who are afraid to hang out with others or just cut friends like me out of their lives and spend time with their girlfriends or boyfriends. When I ride my bike down the sidewalk I'm seeing people literally cross over and walk in the street to avoid me and other people or put on a mask as they approach someone and take it off after. Like what the fuck dude. And all that creepy plexiglass we see at stores now, like, that shit is never coming down. People paid to get that stuff made and installed, they're never going away. Anytime you're going to the DMV or ordering at a restaurant you're gonna feel like you're robbing a gas station in Gary Indiana with all this plexiglass. And I feel like some businesses might look at their sales being flat or up and just choose to keep insisting people wear masks in the stores forever for liability. When does this shit end???</p>
<p>I was really hoping to go on vacation to Japan this summer and I spent the whole quarantine learning Japanese and all that stuff and it probably isn't gonna happen because of travel restrictions. Even if I get the vaccination, I bet the racist Japanese government will use any excuse to keep foreigners out of their country. I miss live music. I miss spontaneously meeting strangers and becoming friends. I miss random small talk with people in the hallways and shit. I almost lost a friend to an opioid overdose this year. Someone who had never touched hard drugs before this shit started. You wouldn't believe how many of my college friends have thought about killing themselves because of the isolation. I've spent the pandemic working on my mental health and still some days I lack the motivation to get out of bed or do homework or attend dumb zoom lectures. </p>
<p>The world is such a mess and I think it could get a whole lot worse for our generation. Keep in mind we're the ones who are gonna have to deal with the debt, climate change, and AI-enabled police states. Lot of grim possibilities ahead. I'm just focusing on enjoying my summer and getting an internship for the fall.</p>

        <p>Another college student who commented a similar experience. I feel you. It’s so depressing because I have no fucking idea what there is to look forward to with our generation.
