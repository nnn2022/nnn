    <strong>"That's not true"</strong>
    <p><p>Apparently it is not true that I can not be seen by my doctor. </p>
<p>I guess when I tried to see them, it was just a figment of my imagination. I guess when they refused to see me when I requested to be seen, I just dreamt it and it never actually happened. </p>
<p>"They are seeing people who they feel need to be seen" 
I guess that makes it all okay then! My health is not as important as others, so I should just accept that they have decided I dont have a need to be seen without them even looking at me, or my issue. I mean, its normal to request to be seen by a doctor when you're well, isn't it? </p>
<p>"I'm being seen by my doctor at my hospital appointment" 
Excellent. You might be, but I am not. How does that make what I am saying untrue just because you are being seen?? </p>
<p>My doctors surgery wouldnt even see my child when he was poorly. But I guess that isn't true either!</p>
<p>I guess it isn't true for all the others who can't be seen as well!</p></p>
