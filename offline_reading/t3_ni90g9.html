    <strong>Will College Students Knuckle Under?</strong>
    <p><p>Yet another university (Indiana University) announced today that all students, faculty, and staff have to be fully vaccinated.  If not, their registration will be dropped, or in the case of faculty and staff, they will be terminated.  This is obviously totalitarian but we know people will get the jab to keep their jobs, go to school, etc.</p>
<p>My question is this: do you think most college kids will go along with this and knuckle under or will there be pushback?  I would like to think that there is hope for the younger generations but I'm not sure.  I graduated from college years ago so I'm pretty much out of the loop on what the younger generations think about this.  If you are a college student will you get vaccinated in order to keep going to school or will you drop out and pursue something else?</p></p>

        <p>i think alot of them would be afraid that the exorbinant amount of money they already paid will go to waste if they dont graduate from that institution. also I know when I was poor and young, I wanted to graduate and felt invincible.</p>

        <p>I hope that students leave colleges like that just so that the lack of funding can really shake up the administrations.</p>
<p>But of course, I can’t say for certain because everyone has a different opinion.  Some are scared of the virus and crave the vaccine, others will get the vaccine because they just want to go to school/finish their degree regardless of their beliefs, and some will refuse flat out.  </p>
<p>I think it also depends on where you are.  I can see all the folks on NY or Cali. Being all for it while folks in Texas or Florida can care less.  I was on the light rail the other day and a bunch of teenagers packed on to it to go to a baseball game and most of them didn’t wear masks, even while the driver bitched to them to wear one.  It was actually refreshing to see that for once.</p>

        <p>That they refuse to accept acquired immunity is really tipping their hand.</p>
