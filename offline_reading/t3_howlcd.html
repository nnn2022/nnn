        <p><strong><em>Gilad:</em></strong> <em>You are tapping here into a crucial aspect of the Covid 19 affair which none of the Western media has been brave enough to look into. As early as</em> <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/bleak-and-worried-netanyahu-implies-virus-could-kill-tens-of-millions-worldwide/"><em>March 12</em></a><em>, the Israeli PM announced nationwide school closures and urged the formation of an emergency unity government to “save the lives of tens of thousands” of Israelis from the coronavirus, Netanyahu presented a profoundly stark assessment in which there would be “tens of millions of deaths” worldwide unless the pandemic was stopped.  Political analysts who follow Netanyahu closely immediately understood that Netanyahu desperately needed the pandemic and the hysteria around it. And it is clear that the Israeli PM managed to utilize the corona crisis to serve his cause. He postponed his trial. He formed a large unity government and practically destroyed both his rival party (Blue &amp; White) and its leader Benny Gantz.  So it was no surprise that once Netanyahu was finally able to form his unity government, Israel was relieved of its lockdown: Israelis were free to enjoy the sun again. Far more peculiar is the fact that the rest of us needed Netanyahu to form his government so that our leaders would also allow us to enjoy the blue sky.</em></p>
