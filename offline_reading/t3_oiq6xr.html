    <strong>Who else just lies and says they got the vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>This is mostly for the lurkers here. I want you to know I lie to everybody about my vaccination status. There is no arguing from me. You'd never think I'm against the COVID19 vaccination. I had Moderna from a Rite-Aid back in April, is what I say. As soon as it became available for my age group. I know at least 4 other families who do this (one of them I was very surprised about). I don't wear a mask and I hardly wore it when I was required to. When I did, I wore a fabric one, the kind that doesn't really do anything. I haven't gotten sick, and if I do, it's none of your business. I want you to know that the template for the CDC vaccination card was available on a public government website, not that I have one.  </p>
<p>If you meet me in person, I had the vaccine and I'm all about saving grandma. Leave whatever vitriol you want, I literally could not give less of a crap what you think.   </p>
<p>Anyone else do this? :)</p></p>
