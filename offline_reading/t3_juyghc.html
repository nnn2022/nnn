    <strong>Poll: How many people live in smaller cities or towns or rural communities?</strong>
    <p><p>All the hot spots seem to be localized to cities, but the lockdowns are state or nation wide. Just curious how many people live in more remote communities but are also affected or not affected. To clarify, anything over 100k is a larger city, imo. </p>

        <p>Town of 5k. With surrounding towns that we have to go to for anything we are about 15-20k combined.</p>
<p>People are still ridiculous here. I can go in some stores without a mask, have been asked to leave or harassed at others so I just leave - If I haven't been to a place since the statewide mask mandate I just don't go at all as I don't feel like finding out if they're making their employees act crazy or not.</p>
<p>We live off major highway so there's quite a few fast food spots on that stretch and all of the dining rooms have closed, opened back, closed again, and now there's a mixture. We just drive thru. </p>
<p>All of the expected plexiglass and most people wearing masks but nowhere near what it's like for those in bigger, major cities of hell from what it sounds like when I talk to others. I definitely get rude looks, have had remarks said, for not wearing one but also have a handful of people I know nearby that are in agreement with noncompliance. </p>
<p>It's making a bit of rounds in the county jail right now, as to be expected, so hopefully everyone is alright there. Can't remember exactly how many people had it per the sheriff but it is staff and jailed both. </p>
<p>There are about 50k in my entire county, we've had a <em>total</em> of 1684 cases this year with 50 deaths. Most of those deaths were nursing home related. </p>
<p>Oh, there's also a free testing site set up that I've seen people at several times and at one point a few months back I had to go to urgent care for a completely unrelated to Covid reason and was told basically that a lot of people are being made to get a Covid test to go back to work <em>even if their symptoms don't have anything to do with COVID</em> if they take a sick day at work. So there's that nonsense going around I suppose.</p>

        <p>We're rural, live a few miles from a town with population just under 11k.  Some things are affected, some not.  There are some businesses that have closed down from this.  Some people wear masks, some don't.  Most businesses suggest wearing masks to enter, a lot don't enforce.  We live a about 100 miles from a major city and the interstate passes through our smaller town.  As of now we have about 80 active cases in our small town, and it's been about the 80 cases mark for months now.  I know a few people that are 'active', regular cold symptoms.  We've been lucky so far living in a state that isn't as strict as some, and it's even a little less so where we live.  So glad I'm not in a bigger city.  I can't imagine what those of you that do are going through, and my heart goes out to you all.</p>

        <p>I live in a smaller network of towns, everything here is in almost 100% compliance besides some gas stations and small shops but almost nowhere is actually enforcing anything. Everywhere that can be open is open but restaurants are restricted as far as I know and we lost some businesses too. No major highways connecting it all together and you need to get on them to get to the more busy locations on large, main one's. It's a pretty small community and out in more rural areas there isn't too much going on at all and never was, where there isn't these little networks of towns there is a lot of forest and a little people, you'd be lucky to find a Walmart in the more out of the way areas.</p>

        <p>I live in a town of about 11,000 that's not very affected. There are a handful of cases off and on. In Ontario, only the hotspots have the strictest restrictions, thank goodness, but we still have some restrictions and mandatory masks indoors.</p>
