    <strong>I’m pregnant and scared about the future.</strong>
    <p><p>A week ago I found out that I’m pregnant. I told my boyfriend and he was happy but I’m scared. We had a long talk and I’m worried about what’s going to happen in the future and how they’ll have to grow up. I feel incredibly guilty for getting pregnant. We weren’t actively trying for a baby but we planned on having one in the future depending on how things were going.</p>
<p>I see stuff on the news and get so frustrated and angry. It feels like everything is about to collapse. My boyfriend knows this and will just unhook the DVR and unplug the internet so I can’t get worked up. I’ll ignore everything for a few days, then see the news and get so much anxiety.</p>
<p>We’re getting married next week. I’m trying to look forward to it but I just keep worrying about the baby. I can’t help but feel like I’m bringing this baby into a world of misery.</p></p>

<p>Congratulations! Yes, the world sucks <em>right now,</em> but if you focus on what you have, a husband and a newborn on the way, you <em>will</em> find joy and happiness.</p>

        <p>Humans have had babies in much worse conditions and still have had an overall loving experience with the good outweighing the bad. Unplug from social media. Most people IRL are not idiots like they are on social media. And the ones on social media wouldn’t dare say anything to your face most of the time. Congratulations and God bless.</p>

        <p>The concern you have about your child's future is perfectly normal. Every generation has felt the same way in the past and will in the future. This is called adulthood--where you realize that life isn't perfect. 
What is most important is the world you make for your family. Will your family's world be anchored in bravery and fortitude or fear and trembling? Will you have a family of unconditional love or emotional servitude? Will you let others decide your family's future or will you pave your own destiny? 
Construct your tomorrows.</p>

        <p>You have no reason to feel guilty. Life will continue. Your child will likely have a wonderful life. We’re under some really crazy authoritarian governments right now but this shall pass. Your kid will probably enjoy mind blowing technology. Despite all of the doomerism about the future, things like child mortality and hunger have been going down everywhere, life expectancy going up, like a billion people came out of poverty, etc. Its really not all that bad. For now, just vote our all these psychopaths in government.</p>

<p>Dragonslayers?   You are supposed to kill the dragons for your children like our parents did for us.  This fight isn't gonna be the same type.  It comes to every generation. And simply having children means that your well-being depends on their survival. </p>
<p>So hopefully you are the good example that helps them to understand how to fight.</p>

        <p>Mama to Mama: the worry and anxiety you're experiencing is proof positive you'll be an amazing Mama. We need to live life and have children and grow life that refuses to be snuffed out by a totalitarian world. We need to fight and love and hold onto our God given rights. Having a baby no matter what is the best thing that will ever happen to you unless you're literally insane. You will be knocked over by the love you feel, your heart will be bigger than you. You will feel more deeply, fight harder and be stronger. You can do this.</p>

        <p>Well here’s the good news: everyone’s scared when they get pregnant. I’ve had several kids and when my wife got pregnant with our 5th last year, I was still scared. </p>
<p>And yes, I agree we seem to be living through some interesting times. But the world has experienced a lot of interesting times…war, famine, plague, civil unrest…but through it all life and love persist. People still connect, share intimacy, create life. </p>
<p>And the “good news” about collapse is that it’s almost never a process of cataclysmic fireball Hollywood bullshit. It’s more like decay. Collapse isn’t an event, it’s a process, and yes we are probably living through one right now, so plan for that. Make yourself anti-fragile. </p>
<p>And tell your fucking boyfriend that now he needs to put a ring on it and make you feel safe because this is y’all’s life now and you’re going to need to depend on one another. </p>
<p>Congratulations.</p>

        <p>Congratulations!!! You are gonna have a baby,they are so amazing!</p>
<p>Yes it are crazy weird scarry times full of worries but its for our little ones that we stay strong and we'll fight. Without them there wouldn't be a reason too.
Fear is what keeping people small and repressed, its a very bad guide. Your baby will not need much of the outside world at the start so hopefully it will all be a bit better when he/she starts school ectr.
I worry for my kids but I try to raise them open and kind but I do not shut the world out and they know that sudenly we became a minorty because we are unvaxxed. They don't fear the world or covid, they try to find there way in there own crazy manners.
Your little one will find its way with your help too. Just try enjoy every minute of being pregnant and later your little one,they truly are fantastic.</p>

        <p>It is scary, and you're never truly all the way "ready", no matter the circumstances. But don't feel bad about the state of the world. I believe we're about to lose a lot of people. What a service you'll be doing for our collective future to put one back. A better one, hopefully. Congratulations and good luck.</p>

        <p>Everything will be great for your baby in the very near future.  We are headed into the Age of Aquarius which is an age of abundance and love.  Things are crazy now because all the negative energies and negative karma that has built up over eons is now being expressed and the truth about how the world is is really coming out.  Trust that there is a divine plan and it will be okay in the end.</p>

        <p>First of all, congratulations on both counts :)</p>
<p>I know a lot of things look bleak because the media is turning everything into fear. But, hang tight and stay close to the few of your loved ones that are still sane and not a member of the cult. Remove sources of fear and histeria from your life and you'll see. You should quickly feel better.</p>
<p>Good luck educating the next generation he or she will be our hope for better days. As long as you love him or her with all your heart and do your best, you should be fine.</p>

        <p>Do not worry.</p>
<p>Have a blast at your wedding and love your baby.</p>
<p>This is a shitshow -- MARK MY WORDS, IT WILL ALL EVENTUALLY END -- as all of this mess is going to collapse like a house of cards. (Vaccines that don't work, variants being caused by vaccines, vaccine passports etc -- the truth will eventually come out).</p>

        <p>If you aren't already out of a city get out. Mind your buisness and raise your kid. Also the whole dragon slayer thing is a good way to put it. Someone has to raise kids that aren't part of the problem. If we all rage quit and don't procreate, we lose.</p>

        <p>There is no perfect time to have children. I learned this the hard way. My husband and I knew right away we wanted kids when we first got together bur decided to wait... Until we had steady income, a house, cars paid off... By the time we were ready and had all that it was 10 years later. </p>
<p>I got pregnant right away... Only to lose my steady job two weeks later and then I lost the baby two weeks after that. This was in the first half of 2019. Then we tried for 2 years to get pregnant again and it didn't happen. After numerous tests and painful procedures, I was diagnosed with unexplained infertility earlier this year. We were referred to an IVF clinic, staring down a $10k bill we couldn't possibly afford anytime soon. After I lost my job, we started a small business with our life savings, 6 months before covid struck and so we lost almost everything while I was losing my fertility too. We're just barely hanging on now and I honestly gave up on having a family. My husband is now almost 40 and I'm 35, starting over again in almost every aspect of life. </p>
<p>But we found out in late June that we are finally pregnant again. Despite all this, the uncertainty of our future and the world in general, I'm not scared at all because I feel like for whatever reason it was destined to be this way. I feel blessed.</p>
<p>You are getting married and starting a family. So many people would loved to have what you have. Try to ignore the rest of the world and enjoy yours because it is a beautiful thing! Congratulations!</p>

        <p>Remember that your children will form the future of our world. Remember that weak men create hard times, but hard times create strong men. Raise your child to not be a sheep, always think for himself/herself. If everyone suddenly stops having children - we’re fucked. 
Your boyfriend is right - don’t watch the news. Its purpose is to make you feel scared and alone on this issue. Keep in mind that a lot of people don’t trust the news. Read books, play video games instead.</p>
