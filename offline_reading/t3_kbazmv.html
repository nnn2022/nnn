    <strong>Anyone else sick and damn tired of having to virtue signal and tell people at work that you had to "stay home and stay safe" on your days off?</strong>
    <p><p>Yeah, I'm getting pretty damn tired of this shit. In all actuality I do go to bars sometimes on the weekends, I do hang out in groups on the weekends, and I do boxing as a hobby. However, each week when I come back to my job my co-workers always ask me what I did on the weekends. I always reply with the same virtue-signaling answer..."Oh I really didn't do anything. I just simply stayed home and stayed to myself."</p>
<p>I have to give my co-workers this canned bullshit answer because people are so paranoid now, that if I were to actually tell them the truth, HR might actually try to get rid of me. It's such bullshit that I just have to sip the Kool-Aid just to keep a job. Oh and when I do boxing, I can't even take amateur fights because if my job knew I was boxing they would freak out and say, "OMG THAT'S SO DANGEROUS! YOU COULD GIVE PEOPLE COVID! YOU MURDERER! YOU'RE SO SELFISH". To even go boxing I have to go to the next city over, so no one knows who I am there. I have to watch everything I say around my co-workers because if I'm not social distancing, I could get fired. Even though, every damn co-worker knows that they are all full of shit and they go out on the weekends as well. I'm so sick of this!</p></p>

        <p>The fucked up Orwellian part is that most of us probably are feeling like you do, desperate that we could just tell the truth and relate to each other. Instead we have to pretend to love big brother or the spotlight of public shame goes full bright on us. But keep up this pretense, and it will get worse. I work in construction, so most of my coworkers are not “stay inside” types of people anyway. I don’t feel the pressure to lie, but I feel for you big time.</p>

        <p>OP, you're not going to like this comment! When your co-workers ask what you did for the weekend, kindly respond none of your business. Why? Because the moment you say, I did A, B, and Z and had a blast, while they were stuck at home miserable with their other miserable family members, they are going to get jealous of you, and then the calls to HR will start.</p>
<p>Remember, your co-workers are just that, your co-workers. They are not your friends, they are not your family (unless you have family that works there), they are your co-workers. Why? Because at any given moment they WILL throw you under the bus to save their own skin, and get ahead.</p>
<p>Lastly, anything you say can and WILL get twisted, and given the nature of HR these days it is not about protecting you, it is about protecting the company. That stuff about protecting "the workers" is just a tag line they use to make themselves feel good AND virtue signal they are "doing the Reich thing."</p>

        <p>Op, what your doing is the equivalent of genocide. The Meer act of working and stepping outside your home has meant you already killed at least 200 people. Now add that on to your deadly extracurricular activites, you have probably killed closed to 5000 people in this month alone. Congratulations op, your the worlds most prolific serial killer. Anyone who socializes should be arrested and get the death penalty./s</p>

        <p>I'm fortunate that my coworkers live by "don't ask, don't tell." But if I am asked, I give a vague shrug and move along with my conversation. But if someone persisted, I'd probably add an awkward sex activity so they'd back off.</p>
