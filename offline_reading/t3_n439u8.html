    <strong>There is a probable link between the Corona 'vaccine' and Neuralink</strong>
    <p><p>Firstly we all know the vaccine is an <strong>untested</strong> gene modifier. Its suggested the pandemic has been planned and while of course there is no solid evidence for this its odd how there are documents talking on the subject of an upcoming Covid virus with scary accuracy.</p>
<p>One of those documents is important and it dates back to 2017:</p>
<p><a href="https://forbiddenknowledgetv.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/spars-pandemic-scenario-copy.pdf">https://forbiddenknowledgetv.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/spars-pandemic-scenario-copy.pdf</a></p>
<p><em>(The above is a backup link to the original document as the original has been altered</em></p>
<p><em>(altered document</em> <a href="https://stars.library.ucf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1029&amp;context=jicrcr"><em>https://stars.library.ucf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1029&amp;context=jicrcr</em></a> <em>))</em></p>
<p>&rt;Within the document is a reference to how the untested vaccine ( <em>"but the vaccine had not been licensed by any regulatory authority or tested in humans.</em> <em>There were concerns over potential side effects</em> <em>"</em> ) would end up causing neurological disorders.<br>
<em>"Reports of</em> <strong><em>Corovax side effects</em></strong> <em>began to gain traction. Several parents of children who</em> <strong><em>experienced neurological symptoms after receiving the vaccination</em></strong> <em>sued the federal government and CynBio. The lawsuit was dropped when they learned of compensation funds available through the PREP Act and the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund."</em><br>
<em>"As time passed and more people across the United States were vaccinated, claims of adverse side effects began to emerge. Several parents claimed that their children were experiencing neurological symptoms "</em><br>
Now, the company Neuralink has been advertising Neuralink as being a cure of neurological disorders</p>

<p>At the current moment very few people would even consider putting a chip in their brain. But if millions were to suffer neurological diseases around the same time, the idea of getting a Neuralink chip to improve their life, to what it once was, may sound alluring. Especially if the idea is pushed by the media and people on mass start getting chipped.</p>
<p>The consequences of the masses having a brain implant influencing their thoughts is obvious to many. And throughout all this the people pulling the strings wont violate the law of free will. People out of their own will, will choose to get vaccinated although the long term effects of the vaccines are untold. And they will choose to get chipped on their own free will.</p></p>

        <p>Unless they were lying, the Neuralink is decades away from actually being able to do anything more than read brain signals</p>
