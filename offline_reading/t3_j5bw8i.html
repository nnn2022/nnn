    <strong>Can we discuss the legality of businesses refusing services to people with disabilities?</strong>
    <p><p>VIOLATION OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT 
(42 U.S.C. §12132)</p>
<p>"Subject to the provisions of this subchapter, no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity." </p>
<p>I have asthma. Covering my mouth makes it harder for me to breath. I have documented medical history of below average o² levels. I feel the mask mandates have a negative effect on my health. </p>
<p>I'm so sick of hearing "ThEy'Re A bUsInESs ThEy cAn dO WhAt tHeY WaNt!"</p>
<p>Can they? Can they ask me what my disability is? Can they ask for a doctors note? Does everyone that has a legitimate medical problem just have to wear a mask anyways? Is denying service to someone for not wearing a mask legal, even though the patron has medical history?</p></p>

        <p>pretty sure there is an exemption in the 'act' for 'declared emergencies' </p>
<p>no they cannot ask you what your disability is or ask or demand 'proof'</p>
<p>yet, </p>
<p>because these are dictates and are outside of 'legislation'</p>

        <p>Here is the whole thing:</p>
<p>https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/12182</p>
<p>Here is the part I believe you are referring to:</p>
<p>(3)Specific construction</p>
<p>Nothing in this subchapter shall require an entity to permit an individual to participate in or benefit from the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages and accommodations of such entity where such individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others. The term direct threat means a significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by a modification of policies, practices, or procedures or by the provision of auxiliary aids or services.</p>
<p>Given there is no evidence that bandanas prevent the spread of viruses, I dont think they have the legal authority to deny me. I would love to sue just to se precendet, but as another poster stated, money.</p>

        <p>Well statistically I have less than a 99% chance of catching the cooties, so I do not believe I would be considered a direct threat. Unless of course I was carrying a weapon or threatening to harm them, I don't think any reasonable person would consider me a threat.</p>

        <p>You can try to fight it my friend. There are already lawsuits in progess. The issue is: even if you are right, and even if you DO end up winning it will cost you fuckloads of money. Thousands and thousands. That's how their system is set up. If you win, they win. If you lose, they win. Either way they are making money off your ass. And I'm not even saying you shouldn't do what you feel is right, just saying. Be realistic with how things could play out. Also, here is what I understand from my local health department in Colorado: the order applies to businesses open to the public. So even if a Wendy's or something is technically a private business, it is still open to the public. BUT, the mask order does explicitly state an exemption for those who "cannot medically tolerate a mask". But as far as I'm aware that still doesn't mean businesses have to let you in. You just can't be forced to wear one. But the sad thing is so many of these cowards who are mask nazis don't even care about the exemption rule. They will kick you out even if you are medically exempt. </p>
<p>Just do what you need to do. Don't be afraid to go places and not wear one. Stick up for yourself. You can be polite and inform them that you have serious breathing issues. And some places might ask you to leave. Fine fuck em. Don't give them your money then. And if it is a place like a grocery store, which is ESSENTIAL (food is an essential item) I'd say just go in regardless if they ask you to wear one or not</p>

        <p>Do to others as you would have them do to you. I don't want anyone using the force of law against me for not wearing a mask, so I won't use the force of law against anyone for refusing to serve me.  </p>
<p>That said, if a business voluntarily subjects themselves to law or threatens me with the law, I will gladly help them follow the laws they choose to subject themselves to. A lot of businesses will start citing mask laws to refuse service, but when you inform them of exemptions, they just ignore it. This tells me they subscribe to the laws but only to use it against me. No. Do to others as you would have them do to you.</p>

        <p>If they tell you that you have to wear the mask, then comply. Then pass out and sue them for damages. I wear a mask so no issues happen. However my sister is constantly getting into confrontations with people because she doesn't wear one. Idk its all bullcrap and I hate it.</p>
