    <p><p>I made a point about people with exemptions not having to wear masks are within their rights to go into shops and they can’t refuse service on a medical basis. </p>
<p>Someone commented “if people are at risk they shouldn’t be going out in a pandemic to stores and stay home” </p>
<p>Here’s my response, and for all the doomers out there who are going along with this shit show. - </p>
<p>You just said it. Hook line and sinker. I agree. If they have a medical problem, they shouldn’t be going to a store during a pandemic.</p>
<p>I DONT have a medical problem. YOU do, because you’re fucking terrified of a virus that kills a very marginal and ill proportion of society.</p>
<p>Your sheer cognitive dissonance is not allowing you to see this fact.</p>
<p>If your POOR metabolic health is putting you at risk of getting sick, stay home.</p>
<p>I’m perfectly happy going out and rIsKiNg My LiFe.</p>
<p>People that think going outside is a risk should stay home. Those that are not worried should be allowed out to keep living in normality and keep the economy going so doomers like you can keep getting enough hand outs to live.</p>
<p>Not everyone has the Fucking luxury to live on a furlough scheme .</p></p>
