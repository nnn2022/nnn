        <p>So let me get this straight: they don't test vaccinated people for C19 (despite the fact that you can still get the virus), pretty much any unvaccinated death is counted as a C19 death due to faulty testing and procedures, and any deaths due to the vaccine are censored.</p>

        <p>howd the data get mangled and twisted this time?  let me guess, like 4 people died.   and maryland turned out to be the only state where this happened so its being trotted out as proof.   more like proof of cherry picking.  i dont know though, shit, maybe this is the final proof its all on the up and up. j/k probably not at this point.</p>

        <p>From the article:</p>
<p>In California, just 8,699 out of 20 million fully vaccinated people have become infected with Covid-19 between January 1 and June 30, according to state data. At least 652 of those were hospitalized, and at least 71 died -- a minuscule percentage out of the 37,180 Californians who died in that same time period, according to data from Johns Hopkins.</p>

        <p>"The CDC still recommends that fully vaccinated people who have had a known exposure to COVID-19 monitor their symptoms for 14 days. And, if a fully vaccinated person experiences symptoms of COVID-19, the CDC advises that then get tested for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. </p>
<p>The change comes along with new CDC guidance that says fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear a mask or physically distance in any setting, except where required by law, rules, or regulations."</p>
<p>But, as the Delta and other more infectious variants become predominant in the unvaccinated population, targeted testing of fully vaccinated people is being suggested to monitor the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic...</p>
<p>11:38 AM CDT Jul 8, 2021 - Jacqueline Howard and Keri Enriquez, CNN     </p>
<p>"The spread of the delta coronavirus variant in the United States has many experts questioning whether it should be time to start testing even vaccinated people for the virus.</p>
<p>Although health officials have said evidence shows vaccinated people are unlikely to spread the virus to others, Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, says it may be important to watch to make sure the more transmissible delta variant does not evade the effects of vaccines."</p>
