    <strong>The Truth about Ivermectin</strong>
    <p><p>As I read, listen to podcasts, think about the dilemmas surrounding Covid19 treatments or cures, the definitive answer to how do we end this chapter of humanity becomes less evident. Or more, depends on the perspective and your actual scientific knowledge about this issue. Which, let's say, more than 90% of us do not have. We go by common sense, gut feelings and overall critical/sceptical thinking just about every important matter of our life's (unless it's your area of expertise).</p>
<p>For me, yesterday it became clear what's the whole problem, or lack of, about either Ivermectin actually works or not. </p>
<p>From what I read and listened to, papers and podcasts , but mostly podcasts, is that the evidence that supports the positive effectiveness of this drug is UNDERWHELMING to most scientific professionals that might be open to a solution, other than the vaccines.</p>
<p>It's really fucking ironic/hilarious/disappointing that the governments around the world go through great great lengths to enforce lockdowns, enforce provisional laws that have ruined millions of businesses, led to who knows how many suicides/mental and emotional breakdowns/depressions and many other negative side effects of the decisions that were made worldwide. 
This is really fucking hard to do. To Enforce it? And people to accept it? Worldwide? 
Well... You get the point. It's 8 billion people. And somehow we are here. </p>
<p>My point is: after going through great efforts to do all of this, I ask 'HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THERE IS STILL NO DOUBLE BLIND RANDOM TESTS WITH IVERMECTIN TO KNOW IF IT ACTUALLY IS EFFECTIVE AGAINST THIS VIRUS?'</p>
<p>That is it. If its an emergency, we would think this would be also a priority and not only create a vaccine where profits are Very big. </p>
<p>If the test came out concluding that Ivermectin is not effective then the whole discussion would end and we would move on. </p>
<p>Is it really that expensive to do such a thing? </p>
<p>Couldn't some doctor could lead a 'funded by the people' project where a sum of money would be required to advance with an official study?</p></p>

        <p>I'll tell you why.</p>
<p>Because in order for pharmaceutical companies to get an "Emergeny Use Authorization" status applied to an experimental drug, there can be no other existing treatments. </p>
<p>If you prove Ivermectin works, and has existed all along, then the EUA (at least in America) all of a sudden is challenged. It wouldn't hold up, and technically the EUA would have to be withdrawn.</p>
<p>Imagine the financial fallout from this. </p>
<p>It would be choas, all injections stopped, governments trying to cancel orders of stock, pharmaceutical companies not paid. </p>
<p>Plus think of the backlash from the public. "WE HAD THE CURE ALL ALONG!?"</p>
<p>Its all bullshit, and Ivermectin should have been used right out of the gates, we would have avoided hundreds of thousands of deaths and saved the taxpayers billions (fucking BILLIONS) of dollars/euros/pounds.</p>

        <p>No, it would have saved taxpayers TRILLIONS of dollars.  Don't forget that all of these economic relief stimulus bills were passed from a direct result of covid.  6-7 trillion dollars of debt accumulated within 18 months...</p>

        <p>I can tell you part of the reason.</p>
<p>Medical ethics dictates that an experiment can't make people worse off in expectation.</p>
<p>So if the current course of treatment (which has been worked on over the last year - the ICU doc's are a lot better now than they were) is established then the best you can do is add invermectin to it if you have a theoretical reason to think there will be no reduction in efficacy (which I think is correct so that's not the problem).</p>
<p>Part of the problem now is that because probability of death is so low you're unlikely to see much by way of results - same problem happened to Pfizer in their clinical trial, they didn't save any lives - fortunately their legal team writes good contracts. So the only double blind trial you could get through ethics is one where you're adding it to an already very effective course of treatment and that's not going to be very compelling in terms of the outcomes you get.</p>
<p>Next thing you could get through is a voluntary study where you offer invermectin to everyone with a full explanation of the benefits and potential downsides (if any). That's not double blind and the results from that will be complicated to interpret and not causal (my expectations there would be either A) that the invermectin would be associated with worse outcomes because people who were having a worse progression of disease would be more likely to take it, or B) because there's almost no downside from an individual perspective almost everyone would take it and you'd be left with virtually nobody in the pseudo-control group to analyze which ruins your ability to statistically differentiate outcomes).</p>
<p>Nobody has much incentive to investigate whether invermectin can shorten the course of the disease in people who are not/will not be hospitalized (and that won't stop them from pushing the vaccine at full force anyways), because these people will recover regardless and that's the type of thing that will be a curiousity study five years from now.</p>

        <p>If people where dying you dont wait for a vaccine, you would want to try different kind of cures.  If ivermectin worked good enough and all people took it, but not all benefitted from it, it would have saved countless of lives. Instead from the beginning it was a big no no.</p>

        <p>Thats sad, but maybe third world countries will start to use it and then it will get better noticed and so on.  I wonder if Sputnik has the same slave contracts as Pfizer or so, or EU. I mean basically the world is using most american "vaxxines"</p>

        <p>ah yes I missunderstood and you are correct. Though if you get concent from one group to try new medication, all the ones that do not try it let's say on another hospital could be the controlgroup yes?  Or are we putting in that the placebos and real group might feel better just by thinking they should?   The un-ethical would be to give ivermectin to patiens without concent, if you got the concent then all should have been fine</p>

        <p>Again, that's why it's called double blind.  If you know who got it and who didn't, it's not blind.  Double blind test literally means that the people being treated don't know, and the doctors don't know.  So you  have to get consent from everyone, and half get placebo.  That's the only way to do double blind testing and why it can be ethically iffy if it's a life saving treatment.</p>

        <p>There is also this pressure on doctors, that the ones that are skeptical or are checking for broader evidence on this subject are actively being silenced, ostracized and laughed/bullied by their peers and social circles. And now, it seems they might even be fired for raising questions on the well being of their patients.</p>
<p>Ethics, common sense and informed decisions are out. And I don't know how can we get them back.</p>

        <p>&rt;My point is: after going through great efforts to do all of this, I ask 'HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THERE IS STILL NO DOUBLE BLIND RANDOM TESTS WITH IVERMECTIN TO KNOW IF IT ACTUALLY IS EFFECTIVE AGAINST THIS VIRUS?'</p>
<p>What do you mean? There are 30 of them! Yes, THIRTY RCTS!</p>

<p>That is why anyone claiming there isn't enough data is either:</p>

        <p>I guess what professionals in the area want to see to get convinced is single RCTS's with dozens of thousands of patients. Not 23k+ on 63 different ones. 
That's what I think is part of the problem for academics , MDs and PHDs in the area. </p>
<p>What frustrates me is, if this is what it is needed to end the discussion about this drug, then just do it already. Whoever is in charge of this responsibility. Do it!</p>
