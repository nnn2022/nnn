    <strong>Story Time: USPS Edition</strong>
    <p><p>I had to go to the post office today. There was no way around it. I wasn't particularly happy since reading this morning they're using the USPS as a private spy agency, but that's neither here nor there. </p>
<p>I walked in smiling, everyone masked up. Walked up to the sweet teller [or whatever you call them] and she complimented me on my outfit. I thanked her with another big smile, and said I needed to pick up a parcel that was oversized and undeliverable to my address.</p>
<p>She began looking into it, so I stepped aside by the wall as another young woman walked in. She was in a much skimpier outfit, but didn't have a mask on. As soon as she got up to the line, one of the butchy, ratty bleach-blonde tellers yelled, 'I'm going to need you to put a mask on." She replies, "Oh! I'm so sorry! I must have left it in the car!" and was handed a mask. </p>
<p>Mind you, I'm standing in the corner, in full view of everyone who just got done looking at me with malice and hate in their eyes, without said mask on, but now a huge, fixed shit eating grin. I stood here for ten minutes smiling like a jackass waiting for them to locate the parcel.</p>
<p>I was called back over to the counter, so I started playing it up, praising the supervisor for her attention and told all of the tellers, "God Bless you, won't you have a wonderful rest of your day?" as I walked out the door.</p>
<p>You will win. Stand tall. They know they can't fuck with the strong ones.</p></p>
