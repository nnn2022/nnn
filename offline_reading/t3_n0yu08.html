        <p>Stepping out of character for a second - aside from issues raised by the rules for this subreddit, I can think of an excellent reason why a lot of you might not want to wander into the discussion I just linked to. Burning Man has its virtues, but is also has a lot of drug use, producing a character known in Burning Man forums as "the twittering muppet." I get the distinct feeling that the mod for that sub is one of the muppets.</p>
<p>I spoke up because Burning Man is something I've gone to and enjoyed, and watching somebody act like he personally owned it (and the desert, too, apparently) really annoyed me. I couldn't not speak up. But in general, one does well to not argue with the muppets, because they're stoned out morons with trust funds, and that combination of smug cluelessness and rich kid entitlement can send almost anybody's blood pressure through the roof when they engage.</p>
<p>Best just to sit back, watch and laugh. Odds are, you'll be much happier that way.</p>

        <p>It hurts me to read this, obviously lots of it is wrong, but if pressured to explain what exactly is wrong I'd probably fail.</p>
