    <strong>How do we explain to our children?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m fortunate to be in a state that has kids In school. My daughter is in elementary school. While we did virtual learning at the beginning of fall 2020 (and it was chaotic) we are back in person now, given the stipulation of mask and social distancing. </p>
<p>I’ve asked about her experiences In school. “How are other students and teachers with following “safety protocols” etc... 
Do you think mask are protecting you?</p>
<p>I want to teach my kids to question, ask why. 
She is a little young to research for herself, but I want to help her be an independent thinker. </p>
<p>My question is how deep are you discussing this with your children?</p></p>

        <p>Not too deep, keep it on broad themes, encourage independent thought.</p>
<p>I've discussed with my kids (under 1) how people often like to think they are doing the right thing (good intentions) but that they sometimes don't really think about the effects of what they do, that sometimes they just want to be good so much, that they are easy to trick by people who are not so good.</p>
<p>I've tried to encourage them to be kind, but also for them to be able to vent about their frustrations, the lack of seeing their friends outside of school, distancing etc...</p>
<p>They understand there are some rules they need to follow at school, but they don't have to agree with them also.</p>

        <p>I spent the last 23 years (apparently) teaching my kid to think for himself and the last 2 things he said to me were 'Watch out for conspiracy theories' and 'I don't believe anything I see online' </p>
<p>So, I guess that was a fail then.</p>

        <p>I'd suggest if you care about your children to never send them to a school that requires them to wear a mask. But it is just a suggestion. I am thankful to not be raising children during this madness. But kids are fucked up anyway and school is tough as it is. Throw the mask and virus religion on top of it and the kids are going to learn nothing but shame and submission.</p>

        <p>I have told my son his grandmother was brainwashed by CNN.</p>
<p>I have found an open church to begin attending, but I told him he has to keep it a secret from my mother. There's no asking questions why, the answer is that the media has created belligerent hateful agorophobes. People have lost their minds and the only way to protect yourself from their wrath is to hide your lifestyle and comply with their demands when they are around.</p>
<p>My mom told me to my face Christians are stupid and bigoted. She said people who go to mass should be charged with murder. All Christians. Bigoted. Ironic, huh? She also knows my children and I are Christian and said that to me anyway.</p>
<p>Anyway, leading your children to try to have rational conversations with irrational people could lead to them being persecuted. Yes, they will persecute and bully children. They have lost their minds.</p>

        <p>They may not understand today and any attempt to counter propaganda from the education camps (<em>schools</em>) could lead back to you unfavourably.<br>
Today: Save videos, images, websites, text, pages, anything and everything that would show the truth that we know, and information that would undermine the foundation of the/an official narrative and/or any rationale related. Regularly backup this data to be stored offsite/elsewhere if possible.
Tomorrow: When the child is older, softly &amp; gradually introduce said data.</p>
