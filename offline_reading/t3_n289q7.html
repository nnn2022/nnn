    <strong>I wrote this in response to "Should vaccines be mandatory?"</strong>
    <p><p>Absolutely not as it sets a terrifying precedent.</p>
<p>Not only is it a violation of the 5th Amendment  (deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law) but it is also a violation of the 14th Amendment (which is the same thing but applies to the States as the 5th applies to the Federal government).</p>
<p>A fundamental problem with having doctors make policy is there isn't any redress of grievances. There is no due process and that is horrifying. With our lawmakers we have a way to hold them accountable, with doctors we do not.</p>
<p>I would ask those who support mandatory vaccinations to think about wanting to give the government power that it does not have and gleefully use that sword against those that you disagree with. That same sword will be used against you when it is convenient for the those policy makers you thought would be on your side.</p>
<p>I hold no animosity toward anyone who wants to get the vaccine. I personally don't want to and that is my right as an American with the freedom to choose. My wife has gotten it and that was also her choice. She respects my choice and doesn't want to force me either way. My 2 children are not old enough to understand any of what's going on and for that I'm thankful.</p>
<p>With freedom comes risk and I will die on that hill. The Constitution isn't merely a piece of paper it is the foundation of our very identity as Americans. Right in the beginning it says "We The People." Not "we the doctors" or "we the politicians" or "we the police." We The People have forgotten where we come from, through everything we have been in such a short time and I fear that the backbone that I thought every American had has been ripped out and the American people are cowering in terror. </p>
<p>We are at a crossroads. Do we go down the authoritarian path with forced vaccinations and god knows what else after (because why stop there once they have that power) Or do we stand and say "No more. You will not take any more ground." Will we fight and remind those in power that they work for us? They are our employees and we are not their serfs. Start local whether it be your county commissioners, county sheriff, school board, town meetings, local representatives etc... </p>
<p>This is our fault and we need to fix this. Are we going to? Time will tell.</p></p>

        <p>Too many ignorant people have no idea what the 5th and 14th amendment are nor do they care.  They don't know the constitution at all and don't understand the founding principles of a limited government or how the constitution protects us from   the federal government.  All these doomers care about is "being safe", even at the cost of their own freedom.</p>

        <p>I mean, it took 77 years for us to decide to add “people aren’t property” to it. It’s not an infallible document. Great framework, but far from eternal.  Times and people and societies change.</p>
