    <strong>To Those Who Use the Label, "COVID Deniers" : Kary Mullis, PCR Tests and the Possible Origin of This Fraud Known as a Pandemic</strong>
    <p><p>This is in response to another recent post called <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/m05um9/to_the_trolls_we_are_not_covid_deniers/">To the trolls: We are NOT COVID DENIERS</a></p>
<p>I made a comment on that post about PCR and i thought i'd share this, because more people need to know. Some people here might say that we aren't "COVID deniers", but how can we be so sure that this virus is killing hundreds and thousands of people around the world like they say it is when we're relying on such an unreliable method of testing?</p>
<p>We need to question this more. It's simple, PCR tests are <strong>NOT</strong> reliable, how do we know that COVID is such a wide spread virus when the PCR tests are unreliable? How can we say we believe in it fully when the evidence shows otherwise? We can't.</p>
<p>I think there's more of you afraid to suggest that a COVID pandemic might not even exist because you're worried about what others here might think. Well Im saying it...</p>
<p>Covid <strong>might</strong> not even be a real thing.</p>
<p>SARS CoV-2, of course is real, but there's no evidence to suggest that it is killing people when we have a test that isn't supposed to be used to diagnose anyone with a virus.</p>
<p>I'm sure a lot of you know that at the center of this whole thing is the PCR test and it's inventor, Kary Mullis. After all, if it wasn't for testing, there would be no diagnosing and a "pandemic" wouldn't exist.</p>
<p>Mullis tired to make it clear a number of times that PCR isn't reliable for diagnosing viruses. He stated the fact that there are very few molecules that we don't have within the human body. As mentioned here:</p>
<p><a href="https://odysee.com/@Setting-Brushfires:a/Dr-Kary-Mullis-Explains-the-PCR-Test:3">https://odysee.com/@Setting-Brushfires:a/Dr-Kary-Mullis-Explains-the-PCR-Test:3</a></p>
<p>With that in mind, there are lot of people that will have traces of SARS CoV-2 molecules in their nose, most of the the time those molecules could be dead / inactive. Another name for this is</p>
<p><strong>Dead Nucleotides:</strong> a dead virus that isn't infectious</p>
<p>And we have lots of dead nucleotides within our body, that's the weird and wonderful thing about the human body, we contain all sorts of molecules, some are active but a lot, probably thousands or even millions are inactive.</p>
<p>The way the PCR test works is that it takes a small sample of your RNA and amplifies it for research use ONLY (that's what Kary Mullis invented it for, not for diagnosing viruses). Each time you're making this small sample bigger, that's called a <strong>cycle</strong>, and the amount of times you do this is called the <strong>cycle threshold.</strong></p>
<p>If you're still confused, Chris Crutch explains the way PCR works in an easily digestible way:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CH-b31AAkpU/">https://www.instagram.com/p/CH-b31AAkpU/</a></p>
<p>The reason doctors are diagnosing so many people with "COVID" is because they're amplifying these RNA samples to a cycle threshold of 35 or over (sometimes even 45 amplifications!) So there are going to be LOTS of people that will test positive because as mentioned, most of us have some traces of SARS CoV-2 in our bodies, even if it's just one molecule, and these molecules will be dead viruses in a lot of people. When your RNA is amplified enough, there isn't a lot you're not going to find.</p>
<p>With this evidence, the logical conclusion to what is happening is people are catching commons colds, influenza, pneumonia etc. but being told they have COVID because they've found traces of SARS CoV-2 and it's fits their agenda. This is why symptoms are so different for everyone, some will have a persistent cough, some will be hospitalised and some will unfortunately die, this happens every year. They can even get away with the excuse of people bing "asymptomatic" when you're getting tested without being ill because they'll still find dead SARS CoV-2 molecules in perfectly healthy people. That's just the way the human body works.</p>
<p>And look, some really could be sick / dying with SARS Cov-2, but how are we supposed to know with the PCR tests? We can't.</p>
<p>Here's a collection of clips put together of doctors and specialists saying as much. One of them is the former Chief Scientific Adviser for Pfizer and the ) the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases himself <strong>Anthony Fauci.</strong> The man who is going along with this madness, yet he admits that PCR is not reliable and states the fact that a "with a cycle threshold of 35 or more, the chances of it being replication competent are <strong>minuscule"</strong></p>
<p><strong>Replication Competent -</strong> When a virus can reproduce and infect someone.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR_sgqQwtsc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR_sgqQwtsc</a></p>
<p>But doctors all around the world are basically saying "hey look, we zoomed into your RNA at ridiculously high amplifications and there it is! SARS CoV-2" Fauci knows this, he knows it's fraud.</p>
<p>Obviously with the nature of PCR, this is going to happen. And i believe that the majority of doctors genuinely think they're doing the right thing because it's what they've been taught, but the whole thing has been rigged from the top down for years because of the "doctors and scientists" at the top of these health organisations.</p>
<p>Here's what Mullis had to say about Fauci: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oza1j2_WqBk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oza1j2_WqBk</a></p>
<p>And this obviously isn't a new thing, it seems like the health industry has been run by incompetent monkeys for a long time. There's evidence to suggest this...</p>
<p><strong>POSSIBLE ORIGIN OF PCR MISUSE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I don't have many sources for this and i'm still researching, but this is something that definitely doesn't sit well with me, in fact it reeks and i think it could be the reason we're seeing the normalisation of PCR to diagnose COVID now. But i encourage everyone to look into this more as well and maybe post links here if you find anything more to back this up.</p>
<p>The first video clip i linked was taken from a panel in 1997 that Mullis was a part of about HIV and how corporate greed has taken advantage of PCR to misdiagnose people with all sorts of illnesses as having HIV. The general belief is that HIV causes AIDS where there has never been any proof of this. The panel says that patients with illnesses of all sorts are being tested for HIV with the PCR test and told that they don't have long left to live because in their minds, it will lead to AIDS and they will die. So they're put onto medication such as AZT (which can be deadly) and they eventually die. The cause of death for a lot of these patients was then recorded as AIDS on the death certificate.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what the situation is like today, but it seemed that the obvious main target back then was homosexuals and there must have been a lot of deaths because of a misdiagnosis of HIV. In reality, it seems like the AZT was killing them, not AIDS. Listen to Christine Maggiore's talk on the Panel as she has a lot to say about this. AIDS is real, but the drugs being given to people who were being told they have HIV we're sometimes deadly, meanwhile health organisations were making money from this.</p>
<p>Here is the full video if you're interested, Kary Mullis' talk is near the end of Part 1 and continues into Part 2:</p>
<p>Part 1 <a href="https://lbry.tv/@marengeti:c/corporate-greed-aids-santa-monica-1997-07-12-part1:2">https://lbry.tv/@marengeti:c/corporate-greed-aids-santa-monica-1997-07-12-part1:2</a></p>
<p>Part 2 <a href="https://lbry.tv/@marengeti:c/corporate-greed-aids-santa-monica-1997-07-12-part2:5">https://lbry.tv/@marengeti:c/corporate-greed-aids-santa-monica-1997-07-12-part2:5</a></p>
<p>I'm no scientist, but the same as SARS CoV-2, i'm sure there a lot of people with traces of HIV in their body as well. See how this can be an opportunity for fraud? You take a dead virus within anyone and you can label them as being infectious with any old virus if using enough cycles with a high enough threshold, if it's there they'll find it. You can then justify lockdowns, businesses collapsing, mental health issues, the "4th industrial revolution" known as The Great Reset and the rollout of experimental  mRNA vaccine technology that has never been injected into humans before.</p>
<p>It's a weapon for control. PCR is both one of the best and worst things ever created. I have a feeling Kary Mullis had no idea of the consequences of inventing such a thing. His genius has been taken advantage of and he doesn't even know it, he died in August 2019.</p>
<p>Now, even the World Health Organisation themselves admits that PCR creates false positives:</p>

<p><strong>"In 1634 Galileo was sentenced to house arrest for the last eight years of his life for writing that the Earth is not the center of the universe but rather moves around the sun. Because he insisted that scientific statements should not be a matter of religious faith, he was accused of heresy. Years from now, people looking back at us will find our acceptance of the H.I.V. theory of AIDS as silly as we find the leaders who excommunicated Galileo."</strong></p>

<p>Kary Mullis can't speak. We can speak for him with what he left behind or see a completely different future for us and generations to come. What will it be?</p></p>
