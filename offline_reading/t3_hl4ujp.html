        <p>The flu one... I mean, seriously, how hypocritical can people be?!?  I know people notorious for infecting everyone with the flu every year as they refused to stay home, and now they are pro-mask evangelists.</p>

        <p>That bad strain of the flu a couple years ago? I contracted it and was sick in bed for a week. Some idiot came to work while sick and spread it. It was the sickest I've been in a long time and there were many  elderly people who died. There were kids that were hospitalized died, because the flu is more harmful to children, while Covid is something they are basically immune to due to its resemblance to other coronavirus colds. Did any of these cultists scream lockdown and masks back then? Ten thousand people died in Texas, where was the media hounding Republican governors then? Where was the wall-to wall 24/7 coverage, thousands of stupid fear mongering articles, and "stay home, save lives" hashtags and the army of reddit/internet/social media warriors? Where were the liberal governors, mayors and officials calling for lockdowns, masks, putting out emergency alerts, and reporting every single case as if it were an Ebola outbreak like they have been doing for the past four months?</p>
<p>Remember the social media fad of <em>licking ice cream and putting it back in grocery stores</em>? They were saying it's just "harmless pranking" and laughing at conservatives for saying it's wrong and people who do that should be punished. Now they are the same ones who call us "disgusting disease vectors" and saying we should be shamed and punished for not wearing masks. I absolutely hate these people. They are filth and they can all rot in hell. If there was any doubt about how fake and horrid these people are, it's all been obliterated this year.</p>

        <p>This is something I’ve been so bitter about lately. I’m officially skipping fall semester because they made 4/5 of my classes online, and to attend the one in person class there’s ridiculous rules in place.</p>
<p>Why am I supposed to suddenly sacrifice enjoyable moments I’ll never get back for people who are at risk or little pansies that just want to feel safe. As if these people couldn’t skip a semester instead, oh no!! That’s too fucking logical!!</p>
<p>Sorry for rant.</p>

        <p>I don’t think you should frame it as “sacrificing enjoyable moments” because that just plays into their hands. You should reframe it as “why should I put my education and path toward economic security on hold indefinitely because others want me to make them feel safe?” This way you don’t allow them to attack you on the surface but to actually have a discussion on the substance. The doomer contingent depend on the rest of us to accommodate their irrational fears because, after all, the response to the pandemic is all about them, their safety, their comfort and all those immunocompromised friends and relatives that they all suddenly have. Don’t make it exclusively about your experiences but instead elevate all of our experiences too. It really strengthens the argument</p>

        <p>Pretty much; if you chose to be unhealthy, not my problem.</p>
<p>Another thing is that, uh, if you're so concerned about keeping yourself and your family safe from the virus, why not just #staythefuckhome yourself and let others go about their lives?</p>

        <p>Yeah but the flu doesn't spread through social contacts apparently, so social distancing wouldn't work on the flu. That's what people say on r/coronavirus, and we know they are very well-informed on the topic.

        <p>I’ve always thought what a weird thing it is nowadays that strangers online expect you to care about their Grandparents. I will never meet those people so why would I care? </p>
<p>Do they care about Chinese Muslims in concentration camps? I mean if they cared about human lives so much they could try to boycott China by stop buying their cheap products.
Or what are they doing to fight world hunger? 
Heck, what about their fellow westerners dying of cancer because of their treatment being delayed.</p>
<p>But I’m the bad person for not caring about some random twit’s grandma.</p>
