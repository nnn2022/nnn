    <strong>The Fear. The Dad Gum Fear.</strong>
    <p><p>This is a rant. Its probably gonna be a soap box. This is my last rant on Reddit. I deleted my main, I'm done with the polarization, I've seen what I need to see, know what I need to know. Know that I don't know what I'll never know.  Its not good for us, folks. To sit here and constantly reinforce our own viewpoints with a like-minded community of internet strangers.Everybody does it, no matter the viewpoint. </p>
<p>Kill your phone, its not good for you. Get away while you still can. But I'll rant. Here it goes:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>My spouse has fallen victim to the fear. Its as simple as that - in a world consumed by fear, blinded by it, it felt like she was the last one holding out with me. But it took her. </p>
<p>And now with the "new wave" coming, the dreaded Delta variant, the commode of fear has flushed her common sense, she's panic-stricken and paralyzed. In three days, she's gone from being by my side to choosing which vaccine she'll get. The next battle I see will be the attempted vaccination of our young daughter, which I will never back down from. Ever. </p>
<p>The kids are next. They say that everybody has to get the vaccine to stop the mutations. That's the news. Even the kids. Inject them. </p>
<p>Because its gone from "slow the spread," to "stay safe," to "get the vaccine," to where it is now, with the whole world (at least on social media, online) telling you that you're a sick, twisted fuck if you refuse to get the vaccine. Because you're killing, murdering everybody else. Because you don't care. About others. Because you don't want a hastily concocted roulette serum of experimental gene therapy that's never been successfully tested on human beings, much less animals, to flow through your veins and instruct your cells on what kind of proteins to make. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'll get the vaccine! As soon as a standard, dead virus run-of-the-mill vaccine is fully approved by the FDA, when the vaccine manufacturer is liable for damages, when its passed all the clinical trials, the full risk-benefit analysis is known and apparant, and it appears reasonably safe, yes I will weigh the risks and consider getting vaccinated! </p>
<p>But it seems like I'm the last one. </p>
<p>I live in a rural Southern community. All the old folks got the vaccine. Then everybody else. And it didn't take long for my wife and I to become the black sheep, the lone rogues that devour ignorance and live with careless bliss. And now we're dangerous. We are responsible. </p>
<p>"We can get rid of this virus once everybody's vaccinated. It'll stop mutating and die off, and we'll put it behind us." </p>
<p>No. Let me tell you what will happen. </p>
<p>The coronavirus is here to stay. There will be an endless parade of variants. There will be more lockdowns, or at least attempted lockdowns. There will be new booster shots every year that you have to take. The vast majority of the population will continue its downward spiral of paralyzed fear and doom - the fear of death, until the next Bogeyman looms from the darkness. </p>
<p>Whether we're all vaccinated. Whether the sun rises or sets, it doesn't matter. </p>
<p>But I'm immune. For whatever reason, because maybe I'm delusional or not, I am immune from the real virus - FEAR. </p>
<p>I still have day-to-day anxieties. Stress. Yes, I'm no different than anybody else. </p>
<p>Except I don't care about what they say on T.V. I don't pay attention to what the media's preaching, the fear they're spreading. </p>
<p>I was red-pilled, for better or for worse. And there's no going back. </p>
<p>I don't even engage anymore. I don't watch the news to scoff. I don't have a Facebook news feed to watch. I don't listen, don't take what everybody else says to heart. Because they're just mirrors of fear, they consume it and try to reflect it on to me. Except I don't engage, I don't care. I don't reflect the fear back. </p>
<p>Aside from the staggering cowardice of society, the massive power-grab of the State, the unchecked sprawling cancerous monster of big tech and social media, there's just something wrong with the whole picture. Its like a bad dream. I could wake up and say, "Oh thank God." Breathe a sigh of relief, wake up and go on with my day. </p>
<p>But whether its a dream or reality, it doesn't matter. Because its real to me. </p>
<p>For the first time in a long while, I trust myself. I've had the ups and downs, the lows, the highs, and in the end you get older and a little wiser through experience. But I love myself and know to trust my gut instincts. Maybe I'm alone. Maybe it feels like I'm the last one (I know I'm not, its an illusion of fear.) </p>
<p>And I could be wrong. In the back of my mind, like some last rusted anchor holding to the shifting sands of sanity, I hold on to the realization that I could be totally wrong. This could be a terrible pandemic from a bowl of bat soup Hwang ate. The vaccines are hasty but good for right now. Take a chance, a leap, believe it will work out for the good. </p>
<p>But deep, deep down, when I take aside this whole community, everything else, all the shouting chaotic voices of dissent  and agreement, I know that there's something wrong. My gut tells me. </p>
<p>DO NOT GIVE IN TO FEAR. STAND STRONGLY FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN. </p>
<p>Disengage from the chaos of society, the internet, the God damned "smart phones," the news, television, Netflix, all of the social media garbage. Masks! No masks! Forever! </p>
<p>Live in the present. Trust yourself. Love yourself. Love others. No matter what. </p>
<p>Because we only have the here and now. </p>
<p>Tomorrow morning I'll wake up, good Lord willing, and drink a nice cup of coffee on the porch with my dogs. The barn cats will wander up, the chickens too. I'll listen to the birds and watch the fog roll off the pond in the gold of early morning sunlight. And breathe. Listen. And try to ignore the rest of the world. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Please read the book "A Wrinkle in Time" if you have not already. It is the heart and soul of this rant. </p>
<p>I also recommend "The Four Agreements," a great book as well. </p>
<p>Shine on brothers and sisters. Do not hate others that believe differently that you. Love them. They are simply afraid. </p>
<p>Amen brother. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

        <p>We thought it'd be later</p>
<p>We thought we'd know in advance. Like an appointment where we know life as we know it, is to change </p>
<p>Look around. Chaos weather. Coups. Unrest. Hate. Division. Shortages. Naked unabashed corruption. Anger. Famine. Disease. Unexplained phenomena. We are seeing so much, so fast</p>
<p>My concern is, I cant see how all this can just blow over, or swept under a rug. Its too much. No going back. IDK... just weird how few seem to even see it</p>

        <p>Just like my girlfriend says when we discuss this whole situation is that despite the fear and hate that we are seeing, it is important to find peace within ourselves. I love my family dearly and though things are going to get rough, we have something beautiful today. I never thought I would have something so wonderful in my life. I have sworn to protect them no matter what. I never expected it to be easy. </p>
<p>All we can control in life is how we approach the challenges we face. </p>
<p>Nothing has changed. I am going to raise our two boys to be men of strong character. They are going to be healthy and happy and they are going to one have families of their own do the same for their children. </p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time post this. It's good to see people still have their hearts in the right place and their heads screwed on straight. I wish you well.</p>
