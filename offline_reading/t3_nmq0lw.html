    <strong>Theory time - What if the majority covid vaccines are just placebos?</strong>
    <p><p>I work amongst a flock of virtue-signalling jerks who've either had their 1st or 2nd shots. A few admitted to feeling terrible for several days, while surprisingly others said they didn't have any issues immediately after getting their shots, and are fine to this day. </p>
<p>While I would never wish anything bad to happen to any of my co-workers or to my bosses (even the pricks who berate others for not getting vaxxed yet), considering how some news outlets have reported some vaxxed people have either perished or suffered extreme injuries from these shots, I couldn't help stop thinking why not a single one of my co-workers or bosses haven't had any issues for several weeks now. </p>
<p>So I was theorizing that the majority of shots out there are placebos or just have a very weak dosages. </p>
<h1>What are your thoughts on why not everyone have no issues even after getting their 1st or 2nd shot, or aren't suffering any lingering effects up until now?</h1></p>

        <p>Yes i suspect they're mixing the placebos and poisons so as to create an army of evangelisers who received the placebo or minor effects decoy (I tOoK mY jAb AnD aM fInE) while culling out a certain percentage who receive the true dose. </p>
<p>Then when those to be culled drop dead from the "new variant" that activates at some future point in the ones who received the real dose, the next round of "boosters" come in and the scared sheep watching the dead and also having preciously become convinced of safety being in the placebo group will line up again. This will come along with more hatred and force for the now completely demonised "unvaxxed". </p>
<p>They plan for every subsequent round to cull more and more until a final big one (the Mark) leading to dystopia.</p>

        <p>Thank you, I'm actually kinda scared of the eventual army of virtue-signaling pro-vaxxers come torching my place down and hauling my ass off to be burnt at the stake or forcefully vaxxed against my will. I already face enough hate at work from a few traitorous colleagues and a few evil bosses, but if the day comes where I'm told either get the shot or lose my job, then I'm in deep deep shit. My finances aren't all cleaned-up yet, and so I'm screwed if I'm fired. My last recourse is to take my company to court for wrongful dismissal, but my friend told me just wait and see, as no one has made any pre-emptive moves within the company, so for now keep my head low, do as I'm told (i.e. be a productive worker making money for the company) and see if the government will ease restrictions.</p>

        <p>I suspect that it's either genetic (same people get sick from vaccine that get sick from covid), or large variations in the vaccine. That is why it would be paramount to save some vials from each batch. I know one nurse who at least said she would do that for the unusable leftovers. Those may come very valuable some day.</p>

        <p>I wish someone could steal a whole batch of Pfizer and Moderna vials, and find some honest and decent scientist to tell us what the heck is in all these shots. Why do Pfizer shots have to be kept in very cold refrigerators at -80C to -60C (-112F to -76F) before being taken out and given to people? And Moderna has to be kept at -25C to -15C (-13F to +5F). </p>

        <p>Thank you so much, I'm starting to think now the reason why placebos were given out was just to get the populace more accustomed to yearly shots (my government is already talking about a shot for 2022, but they're calling it a "booster").</p>

        <p>This is probably the case. Most people wouldn’t get it if they saw everyone dying or getting really ill. This way they convince people it’s safe and they line up to get their booster shots, each of which kills off a small portion of the population. Gradual depopulation so the sheep don’t notice.</p>

        <p>I believe the vaccines are all placebos, and that the reactions are due to the Nocebo Effect. </p>
<p>I believe they are only pushing the vaccine to make themselves look like saviors of the planet.</p>
