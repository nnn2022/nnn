    <strong>Everyone is so hostile.</strong>
    <p><p>I had my son in February. I turn seventeen next month and my fiancé is twenty so we’re young parents. Our son has been alive for about as long as covid has been a big deal. Because there were two big transitions/events for me in that time period I don’t really remember much of daily life before covid.</p>
<p>Everyone is so hostile. I don’t know if it’s just my area but I don’t like it. Sometimes I’m genuinely scared of other people, especially when my kid is with me. I live in a very liberal state but we got a mask mandate in June, which I think was very late compared to other states. Near the end of may, a lot of people were wearing a mask anyways. I wasn’t until the mandate.</p>
<p>In May I was at Home Depot without a mask. A guy came in that was much bigger than me and he was wearing one of those full face masks, I think painters use them. I’m not sure what the mask is called, but I’ve seen people wear them and they look like total douchebags. Anyways, he got really in my face about not wearing a mask. I was scared. I just left the store but it freaked me out. That’s the only confrontation I’ve had. </p>
<p>I don’t know if this is covid related or not but it’s almost all women who are aggressive towards me. It’s really weird. I was at the store and my son was getting kinda upset so I lowered my mask and kissed him on the cheek. The other woman in the aisle gave me a dirty look and left the aisle.</p></p>

        <p>Amazing how in 2019, mob justice was thought of as barbaric, but now it's acceptable, even encouraged. You're not gonna get the hostility from people who begrudgingly wear a mask. You'll get it from the people who have bought into it 100%. And there's a lot of them.</p>
<p>I know it seems intimidating, but just keep doing what you're doing.</p>

        <p>My wife was in the lobby of our apartment building just to get the mail, some man confronted her and told her to wear a mask because he was high risk. </p>
<p>I never wear a mask in my apartment building and no one has said anything to me. I guess some men think that women are an easy target and harass them instead of harassing other men</p>

        <p>Man this whole fiasco has made me so on guard when in public. So sad, it was not always like this in our world. It's very reminiscent of the soviet union or other communist countries where people were afraid of their neighbours. </p>
<p>There are people to blame for inflicting this upon us. It's not the coronavirus I can tell you that much.</p>

        <p>"They're probably all on their periods." -Mr. Garrison</p>
<p>But really, that's a lot to deal with. I hope you have a support system of friends or family or work. No one has really been rude to me, but I'm in a small Trump town so maybe they just wear masks because they're old or like rules.</p>
<p>I think it's normal to feel scared and hormonal after birth though. My friend was terrified someone would steal her baby at the grocery store.</p>

        <p>These people's attitude has encouraged me to keep up my workout routine. It acts as a deterrent to see an athletic black dude with a stoic expression maskless. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't hesitate to get "physical" if it came to that but thankfully I've only been confronted 3 times and 2 of those resulted in me continuing to shop, the other I was kicked out but you need a membership to shop there anyways so they're a little more militant even if they're hypocrites.</p>

        <p>There are three things going on:</p>
<p>1) Some people love rules. If there is a rule, they will try to enforce it regardless of how silly it is. When I started playing paintball, there was a "no head shots" rule. If people were even splashed on their face, they'd complain to the ref. It got to be such a pain, that they eliminated the rule... and people stopped complaining. It was never really a problem. The world is full of petty tyrants that are less interested in living their own life than living yours.</p>
<p>2) People are scared. They think that COVID-19 is swimming in the air around us and waiting, menacingly to strike people down. This fear ratchets up their need to enforce rules.</p>
<p>3) People are hurt. They have lost jobs, friends, and activities. They've been under stress for months. They want to feel that this hasn't been for nothing, so it's important to them that others share in their pain.</p>
