    <strong>Call it a verbal crucifixion but It needs to be said</strong>
    <p><p>So my standard pre-set is sarcastic asshole because of the way all of us have been treated through our entire lives for trying to tell people the truth and for that I will apologize because that attitude works against us all.  </p>
<p>In a wildly over-simplified macro explanation to your questioning of the events I can tell you that it’s one of the many pieces that construct the big puzzle.  Why this piece and Why that piece doesn’t fit is rudimentary.  The name of the game is total confusion with bombardment, if I show you one hair raising event and move on to the next hair raising event quickly then your brain adjusts and previous files move to the back of the memory hole.</p>
<p>Ask yourself “what specifically am I worried about today and what specifically  did I worry about this time last year?” and see if you recall anything aside from macro problems.  The average human brain does not recall specific data over time it takes a singular and specific event to correlate that like: “when I was in senior in HS I really wanted a Toyota pickup truck but $23,000 for a new one was so much money, and today I still want one and the same truck costs $40,000 this becomes my brains way of showing me that the dollar itself has lost value because the same truck does not come with twice as many expensive parts so we just adjust and accept it like the frog in the hot water (inflation being the hidden tax is just one piece needed to chip away middle class, just one piece of the puzzle).  Toyota’s are one thing but start applying the concept to anything.. A big one right now is housing, remember that minimum wage in the 1970s could afford you to buy a home like your parents did, that is no longer a possibility for even average middle class person with well above minimum wage.   One piece of the puzzle </p>
<p>Apologies that one sentence or word cant describe what the entire world is doing but hang with me..</p>
<p>So many pieces of this puzzle are falling into place at an extremely excelerated rate so it will be difficult unless you look at the master plan.. which of course is</p>
<p>ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT 
Which is total enslavement of the free world</p>
<p>We have an entire generation being coerced into socialism with the idea that they need not worry because their overlords will take care of them.  That they will give them money, give them homes, give them health in exchange for their ability to choose for themselves and of course after they sign they will be enslaved to to the machine and given nothing. </p>
<p>some people ask “what’s is so wrong with that concept?”  and they somehow forget that that’s what every genocidal maniac was trying to achieve.  They forget that the human condition for pride and lust and greed and power will be a continuum.  They believe that the general population is good (which they are) and they assume that leaders of them must also be good because they were chosen by the people (which is wrong).   </p>
<p>They will use your confusion and transform it into fear through propaganda, they will give you an enemy and tell you that this will all go away if you eliminate the threat, they will continue to find threats for you to eliminate until they have crafted a world full of slaves who will not fight against the machine but more so love it and love their overlords for their guidance during these oh so treacherous times (that they created).  They want to be worshiped </p>
<p>In order to achieve any of this they must destroy Christianity.
They must destroy any concept of good, or morals, or community, or family.  </p>
<p>The thing they fear the most is Unity of the people.
This is why they must drive a stake through the idea that we are a unified people by convincing us that we must divide ourselves by our race, our gender, our politics, as well as creating labels for us to further divide ourselves  like: maskers,  anti-masker, Q’s, supremecist, Vaxers, deniers, Covidiots, trumpers, etc. etc. etc. etc.  (feel free to start a list it will be longer then this rant) 
The more sub groups the better because the one thing that can stop them is the Unity of the people.<br>
The propaganda machine is built and made to convince you that there are problems that do not exist, and censor all that does not contribute to the narrative.  It is built to instill fear and division so that you won’t talk to your neighbor, so that you won’t question the machines logic, that you will be complacent in accepting that there is just no possible way that they could be lying to you because you are so important and deserve to know truth.  False.  They don’t care about you or anyone else, we are cattle to them.  </p>
<p>You want to make a difference?  Do not pass their narrative on to others it is poisonous.  Go for a walk, smile at those around you, talk to your neighbors, grow food and give it away, rejoin your community and love your brothers and sisters </p>
<p>Unity. Unity. Unity.</p>
<p>And remember that labels and division was their idea, it wasn’t yours or mine.. I’m just here to drink beer, eat tacos, and ask you how your day was. </p>
<p>God bless.</p></p>

        <p>&rt;ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT Which is total enslavement of the free world</p>
<p>I laugh when people think there will be unity and a peace just because the world is communist. Wars are fought because people want more and a global government would just have a lot of infighting. </p>
<p>Just look at how many wars were fought between Romans during days of the Roman Republic. What makes you think a person like Kamala won't try to undermine Xi and start conflicts just to put herself ahead of everyone else?</p>
<p>When the world declared war against the Catholic Church and won, it only took 40 years before we got WW1. Why did WW1 happen? Because everyone wanted more for themselves. They had no problems sending millions to their death for some extra land and political clout.</p>

        <p>We are nearing the end of the game and The individual players of these games that we physically see are nothing more then theatrical NPCs, the idea that any one of them has any real power gets immediately flattened with a currency shift the moment they think they’re in charge. That president, or that PM, or this person or that person- it’s a complete fallacy to believe that they hold the power, they themselves are led to believe they do so they project to the people but at the end of the day they ask their boss if they did a good job.</p>
