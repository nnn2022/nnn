    <strong>Believing Impossible Things</strong>
    <p><p>“Alice laughed. 'There's no use trying,' she said. 'One can't believe impossible things.'</p>
<p>I daresay you haven't had much practice,' said the Queen. 'When I was your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast. ”</p>
<p>― Lewis Carroll </p>
<p>I am sure I am not alone in feeling like I am living in Wonderland at the moment. Somehow, the normies are believing that masks are an absolutely necessary inconvenience, despite the fact that, here in the UK at least, hospitalisations and deaths are dwindling to nothing - all achieved while mingling without masks. They are believing that although all the national and supra-national agencies were saying that masks for the public are unnecessary, and possibly dangerous, a month ago, that now they are essential. They are believing that they are personally at risk when for most of them the risk is minimal.</p>
<p>Reflecting on this, is it any wonder that Germans prior to WWII bought the state propaganda about Jews and the right of Germany to invade other countries? All they had was newspapers and word of mouth then, God only knows what Hitler would have done with social media and television. This is the most frightening thing of all for me about the pandemic: how easily people are manipulated and how unquestioning they are of impossible things.</p></p>

        <p>After Alice fell down the rabbit hole and went thru the craziest adventures she woke up, I feel like I’d like to wake up now. Unless this is “woke” up so maybe I want to go back to sleep?</p>

        <p>Useful background read, just in case what we are seeing in "liberal democracies" is a deliberate manipulation directed at sowing division and fomenting social conflict:
