    <strong>Please don't keep expressing your opinions to employees...</strong>
    <p><p>Okay, so before anyone jumps down my throat, I totally agree with this sub (to a certain degree) i dont believe vaccine passports and mask mandates should be a thing and theres so much sketchy shit that's happened during this pandemic I fully do not trust any of the shit they're telling us. So with this in mind please hear me out</p>
<p>I work in travel and we are currently selling some cruises that require passengers to be fully vaccinated, and we have just had a woman come into our store to ask about these cruises and after telling her that they required vaccination she proceeded to dump all her opinion on my colleague which made her very uncomfortable. Now me and my colleague both have our opinions on this pandemic which we often discuss with each other but we just cant do this with customers cause this is our job and when we are working we are literally just here to be the messengers of the company, wether we agree with customers opinions or not it doesnt matter so for someone to come in and start offloading all her opinions on us it's just infuriating and rude. We cant change anything we just work here, we can only pass on the information we are given by the company as they're who pay our wages... </p>
<p>Basically all I'm saying is no matter how you feel about the restrictions and vaccines and everything please just leave regular employees out of it. Wether that's going into a restaurant, supermarket, booking a holiday. We are literally just here to earn money not give our personal takes on things, so if a restaurant worker asks you to wear a mask please dont give them a spiel about how masks are pointless and whatnot cause it doesnt even matter if that person agrees with you or disagrees with you, their literally just doing their job and all you're doing by forcing your opinions on them is just making their job harder.</p>
<p>Edit: I understand why the rest of reddit hate this sub... like I get that what's going on is really fucked up and could lead to us being in some harsh circumstances in the future but there is more to life than this, it doesnt just revolve around being mad about coronavirus and what the governments are doing.</p></p>

        <p>I get your reasoning, and am sympathetic, but our silence is why this shit is able to happen in the first place.</p>
<p>It's why your employer feels emboldened to force vaccines on their customers to begin with, because no one pushes back.</p>
<p>It's uncomfortable, but fighting back against this madness is what needs to be done.</p>
<p>Even if you are the wrong people, if 50/100 customers expressed that they weren't booking a cruise because of these restrictions then it would surely get back to management.</p>
<p>If everyone just sheepishly keeps going along with it, it only gets worse.</p>

        <p>I dont mind people disagreeing or saying they wont book purely due to that, that's absolutely fine and if I wasnt basically on the clock I'd be telling that person how I agree with them but it's when people hear me say theres nothing I can do about it and then they proceed to carry on telling me how it's wrong and this and that because I just have to sit there and take it and it's the kind of thing that can take a toll on you emotionally so that's why I'm saying it's not worth doing if they can do something to can pass it onto someone that's great but if they tell you they cant and you just carry on that's where I have the problem. </p>

        <p>sounds like you have to find a new job instead of complaining about having to do the one you have to random strangers on Reddit.</p>
<p>nobody cares if your job stresses you out but you, and if taking it out on you is the only thing she can do in her life and you don't have the balls to ask her to leave.. sounds like you get what you deserve</p>

        <p>This isn't that simple.  Business policies are based on, in part, what their customers want.  If enough customers won't do business, prefer to go elsewhere, or are simply unhappy with a company that requires masks, they should let the company know, and the most obvious route is to let someone at that company know.  As the person that interfaces with the customers, you're going to see some of that.</p>
<p>There are polite and rude ways to do it, not all employees will care/agree or feel like they can raise this with management, and in some states/industries it isn't even up to the company/management what they have to enforce.  I get all that.</p>
<p>But tell people you're unhappy with the situation.  Don't be a dick, but also don't accept this silently.  If a company is losing your business, let them know why.  The more people that push back, the better off we'll all be.</p>

        <p>I disagree.
I don't see any reasons to not express my feelings to any employees.
95% of the time, when/if that employee agree with me, my personality is happy. And we might get a good customer and business relationship.
The last 5% that disagree, depending how this person talk to me, or order me, I may still be your friend.</p>
<p>I'm in customer service kind of too. We rely on customers in my job.
Do you know what I do? I pretend I agree with everybody that we might get as customers.
I lie a lot to my customers.
If he/she love Trump, so do I them next 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Everyone that works facing customers, suck it up.
Lie! Agree! Find excuses for agreeing even if it's not company policy.
Your boss care about money!
So should you...</p>
<p>The day we shouldn't express our feelings to somebody unless we agree, that day I hope I'm so old and senile, that I don't understand anyway.</p>
<p>But!
I don't say and mean that the customers have the right to yell at you, or other harassment, for any reason. Mutual respect.
But common disagreement must be allowed.</p>

        <p>So your solution is to lie to make that person happy? Hell no, doing that could literally put my job at risk. Customers should just respect that when I'm at work I'm not here to discuss opinions in too much depth especially when it comes to our policies, I'm here to relay the information from the company above all else. I understand in some jobs it's easier to have these conversations than others but if you're telling someone your opinion and they tell you they are just here to give people information then dont carry on preaching your opinion cause it just puts the worker in a really uncomfortable situation</p>

        <p>But this is my point you're complaining to the wrong people! Complain to the people who actually make the policies not the person who's just paid to let other people know what they are! I've had customers make me cry cause there was nothing I could do or say and they just proceeded to dump their opinions on me, it's a horrible situation to be so just dont put people in that situation. You never know what a person has going on in their life and by you going to them and telling them everything their doing is wrong could just send someone spiralling especially when they have no control over it and are just here to earn a wage to support themselves</p>

        <p>As someone that works in customer service and has for over 20 years, theres an excellent way t address these concerns both with your company as well as the potentially lost customer. One you listen to the customer.....this part is rough, you sympathize with them without necessarily out right agreeing with them.  As they are truly wanting to be heard. You then diplomatically explain that this is above my pay grade, but I can expresses your frustrations to my manager and provide you with an option to express your frustration over the policy directly where the complaint needs to be heard. This separates you from those that are making the policies and allow you the ability to let the customer be heard. </p>
<p>Asking for complaints to customer service representatives to stop happening is unrealistic, we all know we are talking to the small fry guy, but we also know it’s the only one that is likely to listen.</p>

        <p>Even if people complained to my manager who is also just an individual, it wouldnt change the policies because she isnt high up enough to have that affect. Asses the situation, if it's a small company then yea it probably would if it's a big company dont even bother, and just try emailing higher up cause even if we pass it on as high up as we can, it still wont make a big enough impact for it to be worth the stress its caused on the individual most of the time</p>

        <p>You just need to say this is the company policy and not necessarily your personal opinion. You do NOT have control over the policies. Tell them you are sorry you can’t do more to help but you are just a low level employee. If they take it higher then they are less likely to throw you under the bus because they realize you were just dong what you are told. I’ve been in sales forever and this works.</p>

        <p>I am tbf, I've only worked here for like 3 years and I very much just see this as a job for the time being rather than something I aim to stay in. But that's why it's so frustrating cause I dont come here to get grief about things outside of my control. Ive got too much going on in my life to take on other people shit, especially when one, that's not what I'm here for and two, i cant do anything about it</p>

        <p>You are missing the point.  First of all nobody in the business world cares about your feelings and your personal problems. Nobody on Reddit cares about an anonymous person either. Your manager would most likely want the feedback because if sales are low they could get fired. But if yall dont give them that feedback then they cant use it as an excuse.  Maybe this isn't the right career for you? I know people who worked in your business.  And you kinda suck at it.  It is obvious you want a job being a robot where you clock in your hours and put in no effort.  I realize this probably isn't your dream career but I would never hire you because you lack initiative. You are not driven and want things handed to you. If you were smart you would put more effort into this job, learn what you can, build a resume and then use that to get a better job. I realize I am being kinda harsh but I'm hoping you will LISTEN and use the valuable knowledge I'm giving you and grow from this experience in life.</p>

        <p>I mean sales arent low and I'm not here trying to get you involved in my personal affairs. All I'm trying to say is complaining and banging on about your opinions to the lowest employee is pointless and pretty shit on the employee so dont do it please. And if you cant accept that then that says more about you as a person than me. But fuck you for saying I'm a robot, lack initiative and want things handed to me. You've not got a fucking clue what I've been through so you can say whatever you want about this being valuable knowledge but it's not cause it's based on your idea of who I am and you're wrong.</p>

        <p>I actually agree with you. I don't vent at all to employees of places where I go shopping at. It's better we apply pressure to our local city councils, and state/provincial/federal governments. </p>
<p>But if I may, one other thing that people can do is speak with their wallets, which means that once they find out a certain establishment requires vaccinated clients or vaccine passports for proof of vaccination, then I think it's fair to say that those establishments will see a decline of patronage. Which is sad because it screws the workers who could be let go if customers don't come to do business with those establishments.</p>

        <p>I'm not abusing people bro wtf 🤣 I've got to earn money in order to live... if I quit here you think I'll just instantly walk into a job that aligns perfectly with my views? Hell no I'd eventually be homeless and even more unhappy than I am that people shout at me over things outside of my control.

        <p>You're the problem. If you don't agree with all the shit going on then don't go along with it. Simple. This plea will not be answered . This is what happens when corporations go too far. Want to keep your job that is ran by the enemy? You'll have to put up with peoples complaints. Sorry but THAT <em>IS</em> part of your job, dealing with customer complaints. It's never not been. </p>
<p>That is what's so crazy about the covid hysteria in general. People of all ages have always occasionally gotten sick and died. The old have always been vulnerable. No human has ever NOT died (excluding religions and myths) on Earth. You act like something has changed. Everyone who believes in the narrative acts like dying of disease is a completely new thing. Either find a different line of work or deal with it. Those are your options.</p>
