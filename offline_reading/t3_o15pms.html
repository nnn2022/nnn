        <p>Remember 3 weeks ago when you made a post wanting to know why we aren't taking vaccines and I asked you why you thought we should and you spent about 40 comments telling me you would provide a reason, but never did? And you said you would PM it to me, but you never did? And then you said you'd have a reason in 2 or 3 days, but it's been 3 weeks and now you are asking the same kind of presumptuous question?</p>
<p>Do you think it's because you come here with presumptuous questions and won't even try to justify them? And then lie again and again about it?</p>

        <p>I said <em>YOU CAN</em> PM me if you want to have an actual conversation about it and you never did. I’m not going to have lengthy discussions or debates in the comments. That’s true of everyone on any subreddit. </p>
<p>I <em>STILL</em> question why none of the people I reached out to never messaged me to have an actual conversation. It seems more like puffing out your chest for the subreddit, rather than having an actual conversation.</p>
<p>Edit: Also the offer still stands. Anyone who ever wants to message me and talk about any topic is always welcome to. It’s just no one here ever does.</p>

        <p>Ok, that's another lie. Seems to be a theme for you. So, it has been 3 weeks, do you yet have any info to support joining the clinical trials?</p>
<p>This user spent about 10 comments refusing to even understand this basic question. This always clues you in that they have no intention of questioning or justifying their beliefs: they refuse to understand the question.</p>
<p>Finally, after I made it explicitly clear from every direction and they couldn't hide behind not understanding it, they said they would provide it via PM, then after 2 -3 days and now they have to lie about a conversation that is on written record...This is not accident, this is malice.</p>

        <p>&rt; Why do you guys believe you are so absolutely correct?</p>
<p>First of all, this sub isn't really centered around vaccine hesitancy, as most critics would think. It exists to highlight the <em>New Normal</em> that is trying to be established by governments in the wake of COVID. There's a concerted effort to pit supposedly virtuous authority-loving, vaccine-taking individuals against open-minded, freethinkers.</p>
<p>I'm sure it'd surprise you to learn that most people in this sub are not anti-vaccine, or "<em>anti-vaxxers</em>" as the media would refer to them. They're just anti-<strong>this</strong>-vaccine. I don't think anyone should be lambasted for having hesitancy around vaccines that were developed in record time by companies that have poor litigious track records, and bear zero civil or criminal burden for their COVID vaccines. Traditional vaccines take many years to develop and test before being approved for general use. It's good that the process takes time because it takes time to see the lasting effects a vaccine might have on the population.</p>
<p>That being said, I understand the desire to protect the most vulnerable from COVID, which explains the emergency authorization given by the FDA for the experimental vaccines. But, I also don't think it's crazy to not want to participate in what amounts to an experimental test trial for an experimental vaccine if an individual is not in an at-risk group. That's a calculated risk I (and many others) am willing to take.</p>
<p>Again, if you believe you are protected by the vaccine, what I do should not concern you in any way. Coming here to argue with people that think differently than you does not give you the moral high ground that governments and media would have you think you possess. To me, it makes you like one of those people that stand outside of abortion clinics yelling at young women who have made a decision for their personal life after weighing all of their personal options – none of which you're privy to.</p>

<p>That’s a lot of hoodoo jargon you just used right there. There’s a lot of assumption in what you just said. You’ve already made a claim that “this is the way one side is, and this is the way the other side is” when that couldn’t be further from the truth. You’re generalizing people who don’t fit into your categories. </p>
<p>Also it <em>doesn’t</em> surprise me that <em>some</em> of the people here aren’t anti-vaxxers as I’ve talked to quite a few of them and I can understand that people would not want to take a medication without any long-term studies being conducted. However, there has been other illnesses that have plagued the world where emergency vaccines without long term-studies have been put into use and have had effectiveness. I’m not saying that it went perfectly without problems, I’m just saying there’s two sides of the coin. </p>
<p>I believe that I could be protected from the vaccine, but I’m also hesitant to take it without more research first. That’s why I’m just sticking to masks and quarantine. Lots of people assume I’m here because I’ve had a vaccine, and that’s not true.</p>
<p>Edit: again I’m not shouting my opinion from the rooftops, or claiming that anything I think I know is 100% true. I’m just asking questions, and people take that and make assumptions that I have some sort of claim here.</p>

<p>Sorry for assuming you had taken the vaccine. Most of the people who come in here to yell at the members of this sub are the self-important, supposedly virtuous folks I was referring to.</p>
<p>As far as masks and social distancing goes, I believe everyone has to calculate the amount of risk they're willing to take on to live their lives in the way that they want. For some people, that may be wearing a mask everywhere. For others, they may look at the science and realize that they're at little to no risk of experiencing debilitating effects if they were to catch the virus. If at-risk people are concerned about contracting the virus (as they probably should be), they should stay home, wear a mask, or get the experimental vaccine. They should take responsibility for their own health and act accordingly. I'm not going to yell at people who are eating cheeseburgers while I'm trying to diet. They aren't responsible for my health. I am.</p>

        <p>I appreciate the apology!! Most people comment “fuck you” when they don’t want to admit they said something that wasn’t true lol. </p>
<p>For me I know I wouldn’t get very ill, if any sort of ill at all (as I only catch common illnesses every other year). But for me the risk lies in others. My in-laws are sickly, my grandparents are elderly, and (when I can) I do a lot of work with the community (who may be at risk). So I’d rather be safe than sorry. </p>
<p>I can understand the aspect of “don’t yell at people for not doing what you’re doing” but I suppose I’m still just confused on why people <em>aren’t</em> doing what I’m doing. I mean, I’ll be a lil upset internally, but I’m not going to get so worked up over it and make it a scene. I just thought most people know (and regularly come in contact with) elderly or at-risk people? So why wouldn’t people want to make an effort to keep those people safe? Or is there something I’m missing?</p>

<p>Good on you for doing that. I'm not in the same situation.</p>

<p>I sincerely feel bad for the at-risk people, but the world can't bend or break to save the relatively few that are most at-risk. Those are the people that need to consider their health and measure the amount of risk they're willing to take on. In the meantime, I'll make an effort to steer clear of older individuals when I see them in public, but I'm not going to wear a mask everywhere I go because it's illogical to me.</p>

        <p>Ah okay. So what I’m gathering then is that it’s mostly young and healthy people who don’t really regularly encounter elderly/high-risk individuals who are opposing the new normal? Is this correct, or am I still misunderstanding?</p>

        <p>Yeah, I'd say that's a good representation. Unfortunately, if you live in a big city, there's no avoiding high-risk individuals. That explains the harsher lockdown measures to a certain degree.</p>

        <p>Yeah it makes a lot more sense now when you look at it from different perspectives. I live in one of the like top 5 most populated cities in America and it’s hard for me to imagine someone who doesn’t regularly encounter elderly/high-risk people.

        <p>You hold your subreddit on too high of a pedestal. The people here are rude and aggressive. Your mod censors opposing view points such as this. Wonder why my posts only pop up for an hour before they disappear from the feed? Most of you all love to claim you’re free-thinkers and go against main stream media, but what occurs here is just as bad as what occurs on the other side. People here are not as open minded as they think they are. They only want to shout into an echo chamber and yell at anyone who yells back anything different.</p>

        <p>Well that’s a very generalized and pessimistic way of thinking. I’ve given you guys a chance, even though I think you’re too stuck in your ways!</p>
<p>Also, let me clarify again — I didn’t ask any questions in other subreddits because I didn’t need to. The views that they hold are easily researchable and don’t require me to ask any questions to help find them. Here, it is different as your guys’ views are not easily found through verifiable sources. </p>
<p>About the study — which trial were you referring to? MRNA has been tested on animals for several years (if not a decade) by now.</p>

        <p>You don’t claim much of anything it seems. Just that we don’t play as nice as we should. </p>
<p>You say we should be more civil and engage in honest discourse. With whom is this an issue? When trolls come here? With those asking  “genuine question… why do you want grandmas to die?” They don’t deserve civil discourse.</p>

        <p>People make assumptions and put forth aggressive personal attacks rather than actually converse. I ask questions, and in an effort to get answers to those questions, I make an effort to abstain from making claims unless it’s directly in response to the answer for the question at hand. And yet still people choose to engage in such a negative way rather than engaging with the topic in the post. Maybe they assume everyone is a troll?</p>

        <p>I don't read an obscure article and make decision.  I've read everything I can find from many sources for about 18 months now.  </p>
<p>I am sure there was a flu strain.  It was probably a modified virus released accidently from a lab in Wuhan.   The research was partially funded by the US, approved by Fauci.</p>
<p>I am sure the masks in use don't do a damn thing to reduce transmission of viral disease.</p>
<p>I am sure the mRNA and adenovirus shots are damaging people's bodies in the short term, and long term effects are not known.</p>
<p>I am also sure I had sars-cov-2 and survived it just fine.</p>
<p>I am done with whole thing and would like to move on, but I know that corporations and governments are continuing to exaggerate the virus effects in order to profit and further their ideas for changing how we live.</p>

        <p>It's all available for you.   You could merely read the WEF goals for example.   I'm not here to support my claims or convince you (which I doubt is possible anyway).</p>
<p>Your presumption was that people made choices based on a random article or two.   That is not correct.</p>

        <p>It’s not though. The sources I’ve seen aren’t credible. I’m genuinely interested in finding credible sources, even though no one believes that. It really seems like very very very little amount of people on this subreddit actually want to substantiate the claims they make. I looked up the WEF goals and found nothing relating to your claims.</p>

<p>Look again.   Think about what they are trying to do.   I'm not going to make it easy for you.   If you really want to wake up, then do the work.</p>
<p>All sources of information are now equally credible.  You have to come to understand that first, or you'll never progress.</p>
