        <p>Kids are more likely to spread influenza to at risk family members and no one shutdown schools because of that. There was no hysterical, won't someone think of the at risk! These people screaming that never gave a damn about the <em>at risk</em> before. The vulnerable have always faced these risks. No one cared and no one destroyed the world because of it.</p>

        <p>Yeah, and unless that guy is responding with that level of concern every flu season to protect the vulnerable, he's a flaming hypocrite. I think this is one of the things that bothers me most. People are willing to crucify others in the name of protecting the vulnerable, but they were probably perfectly okay or totally oblivious to the deaths of vulnerable people in every prior flu season. Spare me the moral posturing.</p>

        <p>As of July 11th, of the CDC reported deaths from Covid, 92.4% of those deaths were in those older than 54. 80% for older than 64. </p>
<p>So what part of the population that has school-age children AND have people in the home over 54? Over 64?  Maybe THOSE people should consider alternatives to traditional schools if they truly feel they’re at risk?  </p>
<p>Clearly you came here to be a maskhole, so there really isn’t a point in arguing with you because you haven’t looked at unbiased data or facts in some time.  </p>
<p>92.4%</p>
<p><em>92.4%</em></p>
<p><strong>92.4%</strong></p>
<p>If I told you pneumonia killed people in the United States at the rate of Covid, would you close schools over that?
&rt;because it actually kills people at a higher rate than Covid - as of 7/11, there have been almost 10K MORE pneumonia deaths in 2020 than Covid. And at MUCH HIGHER rates in children (0.081% and 0.015% are the % of total deaths in children under 14 for pneumonia and Covid, respectively). Said another way, pneumonia is FIVE TIMES DEADLIER in children and we don’t cancel schools for that...  and SHOCKING - parents always have been at risk contract it too. </p>
<p>Dude - either come here with an open mind or head back over the sheeple in r/coronavirus. ...or maybe you should look into r/pneumonia? LOL</p>

        <p>Sorry - it wasn’t a quote. It was me merely emphasizing my point. If that’s what we’re going to nit pick for this topic - sure. Go for it. </p>
<p>So you do admit that you don’t have an open mind?  Great - that’s a step in the right direction because now I don’t have to try to convince you otherwise. Makes it easy for everyone here. </p>
<p>Your reply mentions science, but I didn’t see any. Please let me know if you can find some. </p>
<p>In the meantime, feel free to read how <a href="https://www.thelocal.se/20200514/explained-why-is-sweden-not-recommending-face-masks-to-the-public/amp">Sweden has fared without masks</a> with some reference science that you’d like to see. But since it’s not YOUR science, I’m not sure you would believe it. </p>
<p>Ironically, I KNOW I’m not right about everything. In fact, I’ve been wrong plenty of times before. BUT - at a minimum, what I try to discuss with people that <strong>do</strong> have open minds is that maybe this crazy-ass world we live in is a little more complex (and a lot better off) that our <strong><em>disgusting</em></strong> media outlets portray...and that’s ALL MSM...CNN to FOX - they all suck and profit off of fear. </p>
<p>So yeah - I’ll be here not living in fear just hoping that people can take objective viewpoints on their stance. None of anything I have said from this thread came from the media except the article I linked. Everything else is derived from my own conclusions with access to publicly available data.  Maybe you should consider something similar?  Be warned - It takes some time to be able to sift through it all...</p>

        <p>Absolutely. And that’s your RIGHT to protect your family/home as you see fit.  I actually don’t mind anyone that wears a mask. It’s your right to do it just like it’s my right to not wear one. </p>
<p>Personal safety is...<strong><em>personal</em></strong></p>
<p>Sometimes I think people think “anti-mask” means I want to rip them off of others’ faces. It’s the opposite (for me) actually - I want you to do what you want...and I’ll do what I want...and we’ll agree to disagree (because humans are complex beings with differing opinions...). But ultimately, everyone feels safe in their own skin because they’re doing what THEY FEEL is safe.</p>

        <p>You realise the flu vaccine isn't highly effective, right? That effectiveness also depends on the season and guess work? That people, especially the vulnerable, still regularly die? So why have you not always worn a mask? Covid will still kill people when there's a vaccine... will you always wear a mask and expect others to?</p>

        <p>The flu vaccine has always worked for me and my family and everyone I know. And what’s wrong with a mask it doesn’t inconvenience you at all. Get one with a design you like you could have a fucking isis flag on a mask and I wouldn’t even be mad like do you not care for the elderly at all. That says so much.</p>

        <p>Confirmation bias and anecdote... it's well known the effectiveness isn't high compared to other vaccines, that some years it's a farce, that people still regularly get the flu even when they have a good vaccine year, sometimes with less symptoms which is the goal, but people still die after being vaccinated. </p>
<p>I won't be wearing a mask. Ever. It does more than inconvenience me. Thankfully we don't do masks where I am so. I would not wear one regardless.</p>

        <p>It doesn’t inconvenience me...if it’s my choice... I think what you have realize is that a lot of people that are against masks are actually just against egregious government overreach. </p>
<p>“It’s just a mask” <strong>could</strong> turn into a very scary rabbit hole. How long until the government requires “just a test” and when people test positive for Covid as ‘asymptomatic’ and the government wants to put you in a ~~concentration camp~~ “quarantine resort” <strong><em>for your protection.</em></strong></p>
<p>So many people have already forgotten that a large majority of the Jews that were killed in the holocaust boarded those trains to the gas chambers VOLUNTARILY because the government said it was “for their protection.”</p>
<p>But yeah - clearly history can never repeat itself and the blatant government overreach is just a figment of my imagination...  </p>
<p>Wearing a mask simply to comply could mean loss of freedoms and loss of life as we know it. And THAT is something worth fighting for (and people have DIED FOR in the armed forces)...even if it’s only <em>possible</em> right now.  Not to mention, pneumonia has killed more people in 2020 than Covid and WE’RE DOING NOTHING DIFFERENTLY FOR IT...and don’t get me started on other things that kill more people than Covid - maybe we should outlaw driving too?  So don’t tell me that this is some benevolent act by the government to protect its citizens. </p>
<p>I will not be tested for Covid </p>
<p>I will not be vaccinated for Covid </p>
<p>I will take my chances with ~~Covid~~ the FLU since I’m under 70 years old...</p>

        <p>An inconvenience is the bus being late, having to change trains, a car breaking down, a computer freezing in the middle of something, a parcel being delayed, rain when you were about to walk the dogs, a plane having engine issues when you've just boarded, chips you've paid for getting stuck in the vending machine, a client cancelling last minute at work, a papercut, your dog barking when you've got make a phone call, a friend being late for dinner...</p>
<p>Those are inconveniences. They're a little frustrating when they occur but don't impact your life and quality of life overall.</p>
<p>A inconvenience does not describe <strong><em>any</em></strong> of the restrictions forced upon people during this time, and that includes for places it applies wearing a mask. Yet individuals such as yourself keep attempting to manipulate people by implying mere inconvenience for a life. That includes being suddenly treated as virus spreading lepers, who regardless of being sick or not are suddenly a danger to and responsible for some random apparently vulnerable person down the line who may or may not be part of some virus chain you may or may not be a part of. Surprise, those people were ALWAYS vulnerable to infection, viruses, bacterium. Yet <strong><em>you</em></strong> continued living your life. You had the flu vaccine? So what, you could STILL pass on the flu which can be asymptomatic and mild itself. You could STILL pass on the common cold which can and does lead to secondary infection such as pneumonia which can kill someone at risk and vulnerable. </p>
<p>Do you have any idea what impact this has had on people's brains? Their mental health and wellbeing? What it's doing to children? The consequences of the long lasting impact? Because I do, being a psychologist.  I've seen the appalling results of the measures you support because you've got tunnel vision for just <em>covid</em>.</p>
<p>Masks play into this, they are far more than an inconvenience or <em>just</em> a mask. I'll ignore the fact that their use in the general public isn't backed by high level scientific evidence, the sort of evidence usually required for such force. And yes, any sort of force like this is a big deal. This virus is here to stay. It will continue to exist, and will continue to kill people even with a vaccine as does the flu. So what is your end game? When will you be satisfied? When are you okay with government overreach (overreach not backed by high level evidence) ending? </p>
<p>Masks are anxiety inducing. They create for many feelings of hypervigilence and trigger feelings of discomfort and danger for many. Physical and psychological discomfort. Disrupt social information and connection vital for health. Many experience claustrophobia. For many crowds of masks are overwhelming and disorienting. Facial expressions are vitally important to human beings and when that perceptual information is taken away it <strong><em>is</em></strong> a big deal. </p>
<p>Facial expressions are vital for social interaction, a sense of connection (vital for health), are key to first impressions, to expression, to communication nonverbal and verbal, to connection even with strangers from afar, they are vital signals that half the time we are not even aware our brain is perceiving and assessing - is this person friendly? Are they happy? Sad? Angry? Will this person be ok if I ask them this? Does this person pose a threat to me? Do they pose a risk to me? Your brain is constantly interpreting the micro expressions of those around you and interpreting and assessing your environment as a result. Take these cues away and that's an issue even if you yourself are not conscious of it. Nonverbal expressions are vital in life and actually account for the majority of communication, connection; and understanding from social exchanges and conversation. </p>
<p>For specific portions of the population facial expressions are even more vital. Some with ASD depend on reading signals and also depend on it to learn the world around them. Others are hearing impaired or death and use reading lips. Those with language barriers. Young children depend on seeing faces to learn emotion and language - and no, the fact their family may not wear masks at home isn't enough input - and to recognise one person from the next as their perception isn't that of an adults. When you cover just part of a face, a child doesn't recieve the perceptual information they need for various reasons. Children don't obtain adult like perception and recognition until between 11-13. They are disconcerting, unsettling, and even distressing for young children as shown by previous studies regarding various masks and perception. Children will actually in many cases recoil from a person in a mask. An infant especially those very young without object permanence also faces issues which can impact their development  - studies have long examined their responses and behaviour to mothers and other people wearing masks and the results aren't pretty. Children should not at such a sensitive and critical period of development have how they interact and interpret other people and the world around them distorted - no, harming a generation of young children with these restrictions and requirements isn't worth "saving" (because masks won't save them and neither did lockdowns) mostly elderly people at the end of their lives.</p>
<p>They come with a physical burden too, one that's worse in the heat, one that's worse for various people with health problems  - both physical and mental health problems. They can impact quality of life. There are many other issues, too, that I won't go into.</p>
<p><em>For me? it's both my physical and mental health. I have a medical condition that would make wearing a mask far more than the feelings of discomfort that you so readily dismiss, and that is also further exacerbated by my mental health. I also have PTSD and anxiety, relating to an event that directly involved a mask and feelings of not being able to breathe, suffocation, and strangulation, material held over my face impacting the breaths I could take. The ONE thing I still cannot have is my face being touched by anything, particularly my mouth or nose, or my breathing even midly impacted. The results actually disable me. I can say as a clinical psych many of my clients would be unable to wear masks for various reasons... That you will likely to dismiss.</em></p>
<p>You are free to wear a mask forever if it makes you feel safe. The health of your apparent loved one who is at risk due to age from what I gather is not my responsibility to alter my life for, just as it never was when they were at risk of say influenza.  I say this as someone with an grandfather almost 90 and a grandmother in her 90s who I love endlessly. They are perfectly capable of assessing their own risks and precautions they wish to take, deciding which risks are worth actually living not just existing. They travel to countries with far worse diseases. They are well used to it and don't actually want the world changed for them. Those I know at risk for other reasons are actually the least concerned and don't want any of this, they want to live not survive, and are well used to the risks they face and have been out the whole time. They don't need others who never gave a damn before virtual signaling like they are heros for #stayinghome or wearing a mask on their behalf. </p>
<p><strong><em>It's not just staying home, it's not just distancing, it's not just a closed business, it's not just a mask. It's not just...</em></strong></p>

<p>The news makes it seem as if we are all in immediate danger of dieing from this. The reality is most of us aren't in danger and you have to have serious health problems or be very old to die from this. The idea they are pushing on the news that we all need to be scared to leave our house to go shopping or workout is bullshit.</p>

        <p>I keep brining up YLL and also the consequences leading to enormous DALYs and QOL reduction. When researchers have tried to address this they're blasted for wanting elderly people to die. These measures are taken into account all the time, benefits and costs, but suddenly it's taboo to discuss it. Taboo to discuss the fact that it doesn't make sense to cause harm to the majority, to cost young lives, by enforcing these extreme  measures in a feeble attempt to save the lives of those nearing the end for the most part. They could have shielded the elderly in nursing homes, instead they introduced covid into them while shutting down the world.</p>

        <p>If anything is proof that we need kids back in school now, it’s that we need them to learn how to properly do math, make graphs, live on a budget, and manage their time. See kids, you don’t want to grow up to be politicians, governors, or nationally known virologists and employees of the CDC.</p>

        <p>Yeah, but you aren't allowed to talk about this because "It'S nOt ThE fLu ThOuGh!" I posted flu deaths in children vs COVID deaths in children on my social media and got reamed.
