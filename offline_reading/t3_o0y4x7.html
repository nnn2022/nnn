    <strong>An outsider seeking information</strong>
    <p><p>i consider myself a somewhat skeptical person in general and would like to learn more about the critiques of the “new normal”:</p>
<p>what is motivating top tier scientists to spread fear and falsify reports on how serious the virus is? why do what seems to be the vast majority of md’s and otherwise highly qualified individuals support the covid vaccines, masks, social distancing etc. </p>
<p>what’s the root of it all? who is benefitting from our world being plunged into turmoil like this?</p>
<p>very open to discussion, just trying to learn</p></p>

        <p>As someone who is also in the middle on this debate, I definitely agree the lockdown went too far in restricting our own personal freedoms, but this great Barrington declaration seems to be less altruistic than it first appears </p>
<p>The three authors of this declaration either published studies done with poor science and unconfirmed data, or were directly funded by corporations which have skin in the game, namely airline corporations.</p>
<p>The declaration was also paid for by a libertarian think tank in part funded by the Koch Brothers.</p>
<p>Moreover, the 15k scientists and 43k medical practiotiners might not be actually scientists and medical practitioners. Upon me trying to "sign" the declaration, all that was needed to confirm I was a professional in a related field was me saying I was. If you look through the list of names, there is also many, many obviously fake names. </p>
<p>I think more than ever the American people need to be aware of corporations and billionaires playing both sides of the game, so to speak. Without proper research, the media can and will smear an entire movement with a few unintentionally made points.</p>
<p>I'd just hate to see this sub go the usual way of tribalism politics, as I think open discussion on this topic is very dissuaded by the media, and this sub being what it is, although some may not agree with it, is important nonetheless.</p>

        <p>What motivates them?</p>
<p>2 things  come to my mind </p>
<p>First  - check out how medical professionals ( or anyone else really ) is treated when they dare to say anything against the official narrative to</p>
<p>Second - check out the financial profiles of the top 1% and how much money they made with this panic ( and also do the math on how much money is spend  / earned on and with the vaccine )</p>

        <p>I guess what's motivating them to say what they're saying is their long and detailed medical education, their years of experience in their field, their years studying coronaviruses and vaccine delivery methods and MRNA, previous pandemics, the facts as numbers prove what's happening, stuff like that.</p>
<p>Or the lizard royal family told them to do it in order to enslave humanity and take away people's liberties so Amazon could make 400 billion profit instead of 380 billion.</p>
<p>I'm not sure which one.</p>
