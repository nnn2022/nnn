        <p>You could not have this situation.  The ultimate goal was to sacrifice all of our livelihoods and mental health, so as to have Trump not win re-election.  The lockdowns occurred around a month after the first failed impeachment.  No doubt in my mind.  Government overreach was all about taking that election.  It worked.  Barely, but it worked.  </p>

        <p>The crux of this post is that a good chunk of the fear that comes with COVID is the “devil I know” fallacy. People don’t panic like this about other diseases that kill similar amounts every year (like  TB) partially because they’ve been around for so long and they’ve accepted them for what they are. If this was a flu variant that killed a similar amount of people there would be a lot less panic because people have already accepted the flu as a part of life</p>

        <p>but lockdowns slow down infection rates, and even with lockdowns, we have 4x as many US covid deaths as we had US H3N2 deaths. also, H3N2 vaccine was developed 4 months into the pandemic. globally H3N2 killed 1-4 million according to wikipedia. covid is at 2 million, and that's with near global lockdowns and containment efforts. however we have over twice the global population we had in 1968 so proportionately yes the H3N2 pandemic carried a very large toll.</p>
<p>do you actually think covid wouldn't be that bad without lockdowns? in my city, when infection rates start to climb sharply, we change the restrictions and within about 3 weeks the rates decrease again. you can see this all over the country, the data is freely available. and even in sweden, where they had no lockdowns for most of 2020, their economy still suffered like ours did because people were staying home out of fear anyways. you could probably claim that "oh the data is all faked to make lockdowns look like they work" but theres not much evidence of that, and that would require a massive effort to keep hundreds of thousands of academic experts quiet and "in on it."</p>
<p>seems like the simple truth here is A) lockdowns prevent the spread of covid19 and B) even with the current rate of infection WITH lockdowns, we are still seeing massive amounts of death and suffering.</p>

        <p>Permanent lockdowns do indeed keep communicable diseases to a minimum. That's obvious. Problem is, doing so kills so much more than the casualties of the actual disease(s).</p>
<p>&rt; in my city, when infection rates start to climb sharply, we change the restrictions and within about 3 weeks the rates decrease again.</p>
<p>So businesses start rolling, restaurants order perishable products, events are scheduled, people make plans -- then some elected official panics and without warning, everything is shut down. Food goes bad, people lose hours of work, others lose jobs in gig work. Wash, rinse, repeat.</p>
<p>And all of that because the ones who don't want to risk catching what's going around don't do what they've done all of their lives and stay out of crowds. No, these idiots actually place responsibility for their health and well-being into the hands of strangers who neither know them nor care about them.</p>
<p>Look, no one is forcing you to attend concerts or sporting events, or eat in restaurants, or even shop for groceries in person. Stay home, secure in the knowledge that you're doing the right thing for yourself and your loved ones. After all, not everyone has the ability to stay home and do their job. Some people must actually do their work in person, and staying home isn't an option for them.</p>
