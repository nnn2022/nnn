    <strong>A small vent on family</strong>
    <p><p>My grandma is getting the vaccine. I tried to convince her not to but my uncle I think he convinced her. God I'm fucking scared. I can't be angry at her because if she dies I know I will bitterly regret getting angry. I prayed for her and I will pray more but I'm just scared what happens if she gets sick. I just hope they're out of the vaccine. Please God I don't want her t die.</p></p>

        <p>All the side effects these vaccines r having and she is going to take it..and normally she is a worrywart about the smallest of injuries because she was a nurse and she has gone through some bad shit. While she told me she said she was gonna ask my dad If he wanted me to take the vaccine. But I don't care what he says on that shit. I genuinely don't want to take it! The vaccines have been fucking around with women's periods and shit and I am young. Why would I want to fuck up my system like that.
I'm gonna vomit</p>

        <p>Statistically she will probably be fine. The odds are in her favor. However, I have no idea about long term effects.  I for one am not as interested in immediate side effects or death. However the propoganda, marketing, bullying, suggest something far, far worse, to me.  I am a firm believer that this virus hoax (hoax meaning the disproportionate reaction to a less than 1% death rate, with NO deaths from plain old pnemonia and flu like past years) was all about the vaccine.  Its not science fiction to suggest that tech overlords, governments, and pharma have a vested interest in power as well as profit.  Controlling the population is key to their expansion.  I don't know the FULL intention of the vaccine, but nothing can be ruled out at the moment, and I don't believe its to cause immediate death or disability... I believe it has a long term purpose that will result in even more money and even more power for the evil corrupt billionaires ruling over us.</p>

        <p>Im fairly certain there is no benefit to turning humans into mutants. Tracking their activity and controling their health though, this will result in big profit, big power. I wouldnt worry too much. Whatever is behind this vaccine agenda is targeted at dissidents...grandmas rarely are dissidents, they are already heavily dependent on the powers that be.</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry. Does she have any history with heart or cardiovascular issues? Or does your grandma have <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001109.htm"><strong>Varicose veins</strong></a>? It can be painful for seniors, and I'm worried that if she takes any of these covid-related shots that then she might feel pain or worse. Is there anyone else in your family who you can gather and speak to her as a group to urge her not to take it? Or is she that worried about covid-19? One thing I've learned is that if this virus is as deadly as they say, then hand-washing and simply staying away from sick people is the best way to avoid getting sick. A lot of people don't wash their hands. </p>
<p>I hope she doesn't take it. I pray for you and your grandma. I'm so sorry.</p>

        <p>I don't think she has heart or cardiovascular issues or any history with those or the veins..but she has said that her heart goes very fast when she's worried which I'm afraid will be exploited if she gets the vaccine.
My grandpa is pro-vaccine but if my grandma dies he will be broken. My mother and sister are at another house. I have no idea what my dads opinion is on the vaccine but he appears to be pro-vaccine...
She does make me wash my hands a lot and she washes her hands as well. She was a nurse so she knows a lot on medical-related stuff. But ive heard of old people dying MINUTES after they get the vaccine and I don't want that to happen to my grandma</p>

        <p>I've read the same things where seniors died off within a few hours or days, or in a few cases that were recorded within a few months after taking one of the big four shots (J&amp;J, AZ, Pfizer and Moderna). Based on what I've read, they are all to be avoided. Also, there's anecdotal evidence that there's a lot of placebos out there for these four major vaccines, which could explain why at my workplace only about half who got vaxxed had any mild to severe reactions, whereas my asshole bosses and some asshole co-workers didn't suffer anything (not even a sore arm). I suspect saline is being given out, but who knows what's really happening. </p>
<p>So if you told your grandma about how Norway banned AstraZeneca because many seniors died within days after getting the shot, would that help? </p>
<p>I can find links or articles for you, but the question is, will she read or listen? Too bad your mom and sis can't call her. I guess your dad isn't going to help out. I'm sorry. I wish I could do something for you.</p>

        <p>I can't text her and she told me not to call her while she's going out cause she'll think it's a emergency. Emergencies to her are just the house burning down and that's it.
I did tell her about the strokes people were having and the sudden deaths due to the vaccine but I don't think she thought about it...and she does text a lot...I think she texted my uncle and my uncle convinced her. But I don't have my uncles number and I don't have a phone I can text ppl with.</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry. At times like these, I tend to pray. I'm actually praying for two relatives of mine who took the AZ shot (before it got banned here in Canada, so they're still scheduled for their 2nd shots later in Sept), as I'm really worried about them. One of them has an ongoing medical condition, while the other never had any pre-existing issues, however I'm worried about blood clots. I fucking hate this demonic-run world. We humans need to get to the bottom of this.</p>

        <p>Fear of very small odds is kind of what got us into this whole current situation.</p>
<p>My own personal evaluation is that for anyone over 60 or 70 taking the vaccine is a good risk.  The odds of a bad outcome from the virus increase with age.  The odds of a bad outcome from the vaccine increase with being younger. </p>
<p>But she's an adult and entitled to her own decision.</p>

        <p>Well she can make her own decisions and I know it sucks sometimes that people do things outside of your control but it's just an aspect of life. </p>
<p>In the end of the day she's the one who either gets it or doesn't and it's just up to her. It's her life and while clearly several other people are talking to her about it, only she can really say if it's for her best interests or not.</p>
<p>Personally I wouldn't rely heavily on praying to any religions diety, as it's usually throwing blind hope to any situation without taking initiative. She'll most likey be fine after getting it if she goes that route, but worst case scenario as you're religious she'll ascend to heaven, but like I said worst case scenario.</p>
