    <strong>If it is my "civic duty" to wear a mask, isolate, and get vaccinated, it must also be the "civic duty" of the obese to lose weight and get healthy</strong>
    <p><p>Why in God's name must we wear masks and put experimental concoctions into our bodies, when the most vulnerable of us refuse to take even the most basic of actions to ameliorate their situations? </p>
<p>According to the CDC, nearly 80% of COVID deaths are among people that are overweight or obese, and the average person dying with (not necessarily of) COVID has 4 comorbidities, which are almost always strongly correlated with obesity (such as heart issues, diabetes, vascular issues, asthma, various cancers, liver/kidney problems, etc). </p>
<p>Imagine if all those people had normal, healthy levels of body fat, and regularly exercised and ate healthy. </p>
<p>How much better off would we be? </p>
<p>Even during regular times, the obese population in America puts a ridiculous strain on our healthcare system. An insane amount of money and manpower goes to treating easily preventable chronic obesity-related ailments simply because people don't feel like putting the goddamn Big Mac and Mountain Dew down. </p>
<p>This gross abdication of personal responsibility should not be my cross to bear. For years, I have made my health a priority, even when it wasn't convenient or easy.Â  It is time for the most corpulent among us to do the same. </p>
<p>I'm not saying that every man should look like Schwarzenegger, or that every woman should look like a Victoria's Secret model. You don't need to be aesthetically perfect to be healthy. </p>
<p>Simply working out a few times a week and eating normal quantities of healthy foods is sufficient. </p>
<p>It's not complicated, it's not expensive, and it's not hard. </p>
<p>It doesn't require Einstein-level IQ or David Goggins-level willpower to do this. </p>
<p>In terms of cost, you can't find food cheaper than beans, rice, bulk fish/poultry, and frozen fruits/veggies. </p>
<p>But rather than force all the fatties in this country to eat healthy and work out, your government and media has decided to keep them sick, weak, drugged up, and dependent. They have chosen to focus the pandemic coercion methods on those of us who are healthy. </p>
<p>Remember how they closed all the gyms and parks early on, yet kept the liquor stores, dispensaries, and fast food shops open? That wasn't a coincidence. </p>
<p>Healthy people rarely need to go to the hospital, and healthy people are not reliant upon corrupt and bloated systems to keep them functional. There is no profit or control to be extracted from people who are self sufficient and can say "no" to increasing intrusion on freedoms. </p>
<p>Notice how the powers that be will coerce vaccinations, masks, and isolation for the healthy, but at the same time make no efforts to curtail the freedom to indulge in the sedentary lifestyle and junk-food laden diet adopted by many since quarantines began? Remember, these lifestyles are a substantial factor in the ever-rising COVID body count.</p>
<p>This is because they already control the people that didn't give a damn about their health. Those people are dependent. Without their intoxicants and government-subsidized lifestyles, they would not last a month. That is not who the people in power care about. </p>
<p>They care about the ever-dwindling number of people who still have agency over their own lives. </p>
<p>These are the people who still have ownership over their homes, the ability to produce food, the ability to raise children how they see fit, and the ability to defend themselves. </p>
<p>These are the people who owe their allegiance not to man or his creation, but to a higher power. </p>
<p>These are the people that don't rely on ten different Big Pharma-produced medications to even get out of bed. </p>
<p>Those in power see these people, and they feel threatened. These people are not subjects or vassals of our modern-day lords. They are free. This cannot be permitted. </p>
<p>As a result, we have ended up with emergency measures that primarily seek to subjugate these free people (as opposed to prevent disease), and bring them into the fold of those who are dependent on the powers that be. </p>
<p>Those in power have made staying at home, smoking weed, eating takeout, drinking, and watching TV the new "healthy" and "public health conscious." </p>
<p>Taking care of yourself and living life normally is the new "public health risk." Now the people that did everything right all along are the dangerous burdens on the healthcare system, not those who make up the lion's share of hospitalizations for COVID due to their childlike impulse-driven choices. </p>
<p>For years, people like me who take good care of their health have had to pay extremely high premiums to subsidize those of us who quite frankly just don't give a damn about anything but indulging their most base urges.</p>
<p>I'm sick and goddamn tired of sacrificing for these people. I could barely access healthcare before COVID because these people create such a burden on the system, both in terms of financial cost and access to resources. </p>
<p>How many helpless innocent grandmas would have been saved if we didn't have morbidly obese people taking up the limited beds in our hospitals? </p>
<p>The current coercion involved in enforcing pandemic behavior is horribly unfair to people like me. If the fatties who are currently clogging up our nation's ICUs still have the right to continue their gluttony and sloth up until the moment they end up intubated on a ventilator, I certainly have the right to continue my much more modest and lower-consumption pre-pandemic life. </p>
<p>If they keep the autonomy to choose what goes into their body, even if it results in extreme demands on our very limited healthcare resources, then nobody has the right to tell me I should give up the autonomy to choose not to put a vaccine into my body, regardless of whether or not it puts others at risk. </p>
<p>People love to praise Asian countries such as Japan for their handling of the pandemic, their meticulous use of masks, and their low death rates. You know what else Japan has? A 3% obesity rate! And it didn't happen by accident. Their government passed a law in 2008 after realizing how major of a strain obesity and its comorbidities are on the healthcare system, and mandated that adults have certain healthy waist measurements. </p>
<p>According to the WHO and Johns Hopkins, 2.2 million out of 2.5 million global COVID deaths (this data was current as of February 2021) were in countries where over half the population is overweight or obese. This is not a coincidence. </p>
<p>"Data from more than 160 countries shows a linear correlation between a nation's COVID mortality and obesity rate, finding that no country with an obesity rate below 40 percent reported high death rates." </p>
<p>Folks, the data is abundantly clear. The people filling our nation's ICUs and adding to our death counts are the same ones who have for years neglected their health. </p>
<p>If they suddenly are taking an interest in their health, great! That's wonderful. If they are afraid of the quite substantial and well-documented dangers that come from catching COVID while overweight/obese, and want to change that, I hope that they succeed in their endeavors. It's never too late to make positive change in your life. </p>
<p>But their interest in their health since the beginning of the pandemic can best be summarized as "it's someone else's job." </p>
<p>To minimize their risk of dying from COVID, it is not their responsibility to consistently adhere to a diet and workout routine, and forgo their drugs of choice. </p>
<p>It is not their responsibility to perform a cost-benefit analysis as to whether or not they should spend much time around people right now.</p>
<p>No, it is my responsibility to sacrifice the prime years of my youth staying at home to stop the spread of a disease that I already had and recovered from without incident. I should not have the agency to determine whether or not the disease presents a risk to me or my loved ones and act accordingly, no, I should simply not have the freedom to go where I please.</p>
<p>It is my responsibility to act contrary to my nature and wear a mask everywhere, despite the fact that it makes me feel suffocated and stifled, and prevents me from using important nonverbal cues to properly communicate with others. </p>
<p>It is my responsibility to take an experimental concoction (with no longitudinal studies of safety or efficacy) produced by companies with storied histories of unethical and criminal behavior without question. To sweeten the deal, the government has assured me that if it harms me, nobody is liable and there is absolutely no recourse. </p>
<p>It is my responsibility to act in ways that are contradictory to my deeply-held religious and personal beliefs and values. </p>
<p>To any sane person reading, you know this is all ridiculous. </p>
<p>Public health is not my responsibility. It has never been, and should never be, the responsibility of an individual. This pandemic has seen us throw away all the tenets of medical and scientific ethics we previously viewed as paramount.</p>
<p>Previously, I could not be forced to undergo any procedure to help others unless I explicitly chose to do so. I couldn't even be made to do something as simple and harmless as donate blood, even if I had one-in-a-gazillion genetics that made transfusions of my blood cure every disease known to man. </p>
<p>Now, I sincerely doubt that autonomy still exists. </p>
<p>Previously, informed consent was necessary. </p>
<p>Now, as long as those in power say so, your informed consent to "treatment" is not needed. If they say you need the "treatment", you will receive it. You will not ask questions. </p>
<p>Previously, science was skepticism. The default state of science was that new research requires a healthy level of questioning, and that well-established scientific consensus should inform public policy. </p>
<p>Now, it is the opposite. Those in power dictate what they feel is best, and science ensures that their edicts have legitimacy after the fact. </p>
<p>And I say to hell with all this. </p>
<p>To hell with the New Normal, and the idea that we are now in an age of nebulous never-ending "public health crises" with constantly-shifting goalposts that warrant preemption of natural rights. </p>
<p>To hell with the idea that we are nothing more than disease vectors. We are human beings, not rodents to be quarantined and exterminated. </p>
<p>To hell with the idea that I am nothing more than a future "shot in an arm." I am a human being, not a head of cattle to be tallied and pumped full of chemicals before I am harvested for the worth of my body or labor. </p>
<p>To hell with collectivism and devaluation of the individual and their right to live life free from interference. </p>
<p>To hell with all the people that replaced religion with blasphemous idolatry of a bastardized form of corporate "science." </p>
<p>To hell with the blind adherence to biased media narratives. </p>
<p>To hell with the bastardization and commodification of everything that used to be pure and good. Everything that came naturally has been ruined. </p>
<p>Food that used to be natural and nutrient-rich is now pumped full of chemicals and devoid of anything but empty calories, sex that used to be a spiritual bond between two people is now a meaningless dopamine hit to be bought and sold, bodies that used to work normally now require extensive medical intervention to function at all, and the purpose of life went from experiencing the fulfillment of long-term relationships and efforts to nothing but pointless consumerism and hedonism. </p>
<p>To hell with this drug-addled, poisoned, sick, and unnatural lifestyle the powers that be wish to foist on the American people. </p>
<p>To hell with the consolidation of corporate wealth and the further destruction of everything unique and wholesome that made America the best damn place on Earth. </p>
<p>I am sick and tired of all this. </p>
<p>I will never wear a mask again. </p>
<p>I will never put their poison into the perfectly healthy body God gave me. I am not "vaccine hesitant." There is no hesitancy or questioning here. I will never be getting this "vaccine," nor any of the boosters for new variations. </p>
<p>I will never accept their vaccine passport, or anything similar, even if it means I will be unable to participate in mainstream society. </p>
<p>I will never extend my right hand to take their Mark. </p>
<p>I hope that my rant resonated with some of you. I hope that you feel the same way as I do, and I hope that this was a call to action. Take the mask off, and refuse to buy into this system that you know deep down is anathema to happiness and fulfillment. </p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p></p>

        <p>I just want to add that, if the same effort and money that went into fighting COVID had gone into fighting obesity, this would now be the problem of a small minority. Particularly since obesity is easier to control than is a virus. The fact that they never worried about obesity in the same way is highly suspicious and goes to show that the whole covid craziness is part of their obscure agenda.</p>

        <p>I agree the obese need to work on losing weight. But this is not about saving the most vurnable. I know elderly and overweight people that survived covid. Now I do not know the details of course. I do not agree with trying to force people to take the vaccine. My work place has recently madated it. Luckily I do not need the hospital like other people etc. Read the 1984 book The eyes of darkness. Wuhan 400 is a fictional virus but the point is we were warned. The chinese government is not going to stop playing with bioweapons. Sadly those in charge have demands to mark us. And not to sound mean maybe people with tatoos and odd piercings should not complain since they already gone down the road. If I get alot of hate or deleted so be it.</p>

        <p>Maybe my hobby is writing?</p>
<p>And I believe that you probably didn't read it the same way I did when I wrote it. Science and religion absolutely complement each other, and you're 100% right, if your religion can be disproved by science, it isn't legitimate. </p>
<p>But nobody can deny that America has been on a long trend towards atheism and religious non-affiliation. By and large, we no longer worship the Christian god and read the Christian bible, which doesnt really bother me, given that I don't belong to a church myself. </p>
<p>However, religion in a sociological sense is alot more than simply believing in a god. It is a complex social system as well.</p>
<p>The unquestioning worship of "Science" is no different than the religous worship of yesteryear. </p>
<p>Let me ask you this: have you ever seen a SARS-CoV-2 virus personally? Not a picture on google. Have you ever seen it with your own two eyes?</p>
<p>I'm willing to wager you haven't. I doubt you own an electron microscope or a bunch of viral samples. You almost guaranteedly have not personally seen proof that this virus exists.</p>
<p>Now I'm not saying it's a hoax, that would be stupid. I'm simply saying that there's no way to know anything about it personally. You are relying upon an intermediary to interpret information for you. That power can be (and often is) abused.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, you are placing faith in scientists and science in the same way that a religious believer places faith in his clergy and his religion.</p>
<p>He doesn't personally see God, and you don't personally see SARS-CoV-2. You place faith in others who claim to have proof of things that you cannot see or comprehend. </p>
<p>In theory, there should be validity behind science that ensures its objectivity and legitimacy. But there are major issues with our current system, and they are hard to overcome.</p>
<p>The same issues that came with blind adherence to religion will be seen soon, this time with regard to blind adherence to "science."</p>
<p>Skepticism is the only rational option with regards to any of this.</p>

        <p>Besides the fact that you can usually see maggots with your eyes pretty clearly if meat is infested, it should be your choice. If food poisoning is your wish, sure.</p>
<p>My point isn't that science is bullshit. It's that we should be skeptical of it, and take legitimate information and form our own opinions on it. We should not blindly listen to talking heads who claim to speak for "science." That is no different than fanatical religious adherence.</p>
<p>Science and religion both are objective. They are true whether we agree or not. They do not need a "speaker" on their behalves. If someone claims to be speaking for science or religion, they are almost always trying to exploit others. If the data is compelling, then we should not need someone to tell us what to believe. You can (and should) take the opinions of experts into account, of course, but you should check the objective data to make sure that their opinions mesh with the facts. </p>
<p>Rather than blindly listen to what a select few scientists say and give them the ability to abuse their position of power, we should look at the data. In terms of COVID, the death rate for the vast majority of people is negligible, especially if you are not extremely old or fat or otherwise chronically ill. </p>
<p>We should have the right to take the peer-reviewed data into account, and determine our level of comfort with the risk. Perhaps we view that vaccines and masks are worth the risk. Ok, great! It should be our choice to use them. And the inverse should be true as well - we should have the freedom to decide we don't need them based on the objective data we have access to from credible organizations.</p>

        <p>You see, I partially agree with you. I agree that people should analize the information given to them and wage the risk-benefit ratio. But this is not a sub for this. Look at the top posts. It's calling people fascists, sheep and applauding not wearing masks the same way people applaud wearing masks and not realising the similarity. If you want a genuine discussion, you should find a different subreddit instead, maybe some libertarian shit.</p>

        <p>That's a fair assessment. And I agree. It seems that many of the folks here are just frustrated with how everything has gone down during this pandemic, and have taken an unnecessarily contrarian point of view towards any and all public health measures. </p>
<p>It's a natural overreaction to a situation such as this. Over time, most of them will drift back towards baseline as tensions die down. Many folks here have based an identity around being anti-COVID measures, or at least they take on that identity while conversing on here. That's an interesting facet about in-groups if you've studied much sociology. Groupthink is definitely a thing, and constantly trying to prove that you belong in a group and ascribe to its ideology almost always leads to the display of extreme beliefs to reaffirm your status.</p>
<p>Just as an anecdote, the only reason I'm posting here is that I don't want to lose autonomy over my body and the ability to lead a meaningful and fulfilling life. It seems that current measures are leading to exactly that, and I feel that at this point, I have no choice but to become a bit contrarian and support others who are doing so, because the powers that be need to know that what they're doing is not acceptable. </p>
<p>I feel that the only way to show those in power that this trend cannot be continued is to engage in open and public civil disobedience, and to publicly express disagreement with the actions being taken. Should the trends go back towards individual autonomy and away from government/corporate tyranny, I'm not gonna sweat any of this. </p>
<p>I feel that most people probably would consider views like mine to at least be reasonable and rational if they hear me out. Maybe they agree, maybe they don't. But there's a lot more to all this than just "mask bad" or "people sheep" or "Fauci = Austrian mustache man." It's really a battle over a very deep, personal question as to whether we should ascribe to individualism or collectivism, and it's likely the defining political debate of our lifetimes.</p>
<p>I hope that I was able to at least give you a little insight as to why many of us believe the way we do. Thank you for being respectful with me, and take care.</p>

        <p>I have always eaten clean, appropriate portions and limited snacking.  I have a new medication that I have to take (never mind why, thatâs mine if your business tbh). I will die without it.  One of the side effects is weight gain.  I have gained 45 lbs over the past 6 months.  Still workout regularly, no diet changes, etc.  Iâm now pre diabetic, but itâs better than dying.  If Iâve tried to lose this weight but canât, are you gums judge me? Just wear a mask, itâs not going to kill you.</p>

        <p>Well no, I'm not gonna judge you, because I simply don't care how you live your life. If you wanted to willingly weigh 600 lbs and sit around eating Ho-Hos and Ding-Dongs all day, it couldn't bother me less.</p>
<p>As you said in your comment - it's not my body nor my problem. If you have a legitimate medical condition making you fat, I'm sorry. That's a rough one. But my point stands - autonomy must be maintained.</p>
<p>If COVID is more dangerous to you as a result of being heavier, regardless of whether or not you did something to deserve your risk factors, it is incumbent upon you to make the choice as to whether or not you are willing to risk certain activities. Nobody has the right to make anyone else change their life to accommodate them.</p>
<p>If you feel being in public is too dangerous due to risk factors - don't go out. It's that simple. The infrastructure is there to allow you to stay at home and completely avoid the SARS-COV-2 virus.</p>
<p>Should we have more robust systems in place to support vulnerable folks such as yourself at a time like this? Yes, 100%. But protecting the weakest among us always should have been a voluntary measure.</p>
<p>And I think you misunderstand the reason why I don't support mask wearing at the moment. I don't wear one not because I'm some sort of "alpha male" who is immune to disease or some crap like that. In all truth, common sense would dictate that they probably work decently well to keep at least some of the SARS-CoV-2 virus out of your body. </p>
<p>I refuse to wear one because it shows those in power that they can unilaterally declare that they have power over our bodies, and force us to hide the most visible feature of our personhood. If they see that people will comply with this garbage, they will keep on doing progressively worse things.</p>
<p>I refuse to wear a mask until all mandates and requirements for usage are removed. Until then, the death by a thousand cuts that our natural rights are experiencing right now is a more pressing issue than stopping COVID.</p>
<p>Until the point that those in power realize they don't have the ability to control my body without my express consent, I will not be following any of their measures.</p>

<p>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/04/children-of-obese-parents-more-likely-to-be-obese-survey-finds</p>
<p>The children of overweight or obese parents are substantially more likely to be overweight or obese. While it may not "spread" like a disease does, it spreads nonetheless. </p>
<p>You won't catch obesity by walking by a fat guy at the store, but if you're fat yourself, the chances of your children picking up your poor lifestyle choices and being fat are pretty substantial. </p>
<p>A child that doesn't have the ability to purchase their own food or go out to exercise is dependent on the parent to provide those things for them. If the parent brings home garbage food, doesn't permit or encourage the child to do active things such as play sports, and models terrible lifestyle choices, the odds of the child being a healthy weight both in the present and the future are pretty slim (mind the pun.)</p>

        <p>No, nobody has to wear one. </p>
<p>So long as people still have the freedom to ruin their bodies through poor eating habits and overburden our systems, there is no moral argument for requiring mask use.</p>
<p>Until the government cracks down on McDonald's, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut, forcing them to shutter their doors to do their part in ending the current obesity epidemic and contributing to our COVID problems, nobody can tell me that the powers that be have any sort of moral authority to determine how I should live my life. </p>
<p>My body runs fine without patronizing these restaurants and poisoning it with garbage food. That is my choice, that I make to preserve my health, and it helps keep me from burdening the healthcare system with the treatment for chronic conditions I would get as a result of eating poorly.</p>
<p>However, it is the right of others to consume that slop, even if it means they will place massive strains on our healthcare system. That's the beauty of autonomy and freedom. </p>
<p>My body runs fine without needing a mask, and I choose not to use one. It is your choice to use one if you see fit to do so. </p>
<p>But it is not moral to mandate that others be limited in their bodily autonomy to assuage your anxieties about disease or access to healthcare, no matter how legitimate they may be. </p>
<p>If you believe masks reduce COVID spread and want to see increased mask usage, prove to people that they have efficacy. Convince people that they work; don't force others to do what you feel is best.</p>

        <p>You individual health is up to you. Whether you die or not is up to you. That is your right, what you donât have the right to is to spread a disease  that you know fully well can kill a person. Despite COVID-19 having a relatively low mortality rate is still affects a minority of the population, that being mostly the elderly.</p>

        <p>No, it most greatly affects the overweight and obese, not the elderly. Hence the 80% of deaths occurring in that population. The truth is that it's not primarily innocent lil old granny getting killed, it primarily is people who are slaves to their gluttony and sloth. </p>
<p>I don't want to kill anyone by spreading a disease, even if they put themselves at risk by their actions. If anything, I feel bad for them that they are unable to break their addictions. But that is not the point at all. </p>
<p>The point is that the onus has always been on the individual to determine the level of risk they are comfortable with taking on. If granny doesn't want to risk getting COVID, the onus is on her to perform a cost-benefit analysis and stay at home if she determines that going into public is too dangerous.</p>
<p>It is not right to force others to accommodate your fears. Even if COVID had a 100% death rate, it should still be up to the individual to determine whether or not they should interact with the public. Isolation should not be coerced or mandated.</p>
