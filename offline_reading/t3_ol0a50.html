    <strong>Help/advice</strong>
    <p><p>Ok so up until now, my family have all accepted that I will not be having the vaccine, while they are all double jabbed. (They just don’t talk to me about it)</p>
<p>My mum tomorrow has an appointment at the hospital after weeks of discussion, tests, biopsies etc we are expecting her to be diagnosed with a serious case of cancer.</p>
<p>My older sister yesterday told me that I would need to have the vaccine if my mum is going to be undergoing chemo, and in fact even if it isn’t treatable. Should I wish to still be able to be around her or the rest of the family.</p>
<p>Not really sure of my question, just so unhappy that it’s going to get to the point where it’s ‘so you’re happy to risk mums health because you don’t want the vaccine’</p>
<p>What can I do?!</p></p>

        <p>Just don’t get it…? Your sister can have her own opinion, but that doesn’t change the fact that you’re not doing your mom any favors by getting  a kill shot yourself.</p>

        <p>You could get an antibodies test at Lifelabs... if you haven't had COVID yet, chances are you have natural immunity and wouldn't need to be vaccinated.  You could also provide a negative COVID test before visiting which could become a little expensive, but that's what I will be doing since I've been banned from my family members houses also.    The thing is more fully-vaccinated are getting COVID than unvaccinated.  There's a DELTA breakout in my towns long-term care home, and 17 are fully-vaccinated cases and only 1 unvaccinated case.  Sadly, 4 people dead so far.    We should all be very concerned for our vaccinated loved ones.  I'm very very worried.  Sending prayers to your mom.</p>

        <p>Antibodies test sounds like a good idea. I’m a delivery driver knocking on over 150 doors a day, have never once warn a mask, haven’t washed my hands any more than I would’ve done prior, was still seeing friends etc during lockdown and I never caught it. At least that I know of. </p>
<p>It’s getting scary isn’t it. I’m more worried now for the vaccinated than I ever was for everyone during the ‘worst of it’.</p>

        <p>You could say that vaccine does not stop transmission so the outcome will be the same! Come on peeps</p>
<p>I will go as far as to say the covid shots don't do shit for symptoms either. Virus gets weaker as it mutates but spreads more rapidly. I noticed the government is using natures scientific fact and crediting the vaccines.</p>
<p>Shit is stupid</p>
<p>Another one.</p>
<p>Yes there was mutations before vaccines. That's what viruses do. Vaccines just increases the rate in which they mutate!</p>
