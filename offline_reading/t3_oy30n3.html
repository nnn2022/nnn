    <strong>[META] Please report subreddits that are banning you for participating in this subreddit</strong>
    <p><p>(Please mods remove this if this isn't appropriate for discussion.)</p>
<p>As I'm sure you're all aware, multiple subreddits have been banning users who participate (either by commenting or posting) in this subreddit. The message is of the following:</p>
<p>&rt;You have been banned for participating in r/nonewnormal, which is known for being a disease vector to other subreddits and society.</p>
<p>&rt;This action was performed by a bot which does not check the context of your comment.</p>
<p>&rt;To be unbanned respond to this message with a promise to avoid that subreddit.</p>
<p>&rt;Any other response will be ignored and is consent for us to mute you.</p>
<p>&rt;You can report misinformation on reddit by using this form: http://www.reddit.com/report?reason=this-is-misinformation</p>
<p>Never mind the absurdity of the assertions itself, these mass bannings are a violation of reddit sitewide content policy.  ​</p>
<p>&rt; Rule 1</p>
<p>&rt; <a href="https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy">Remember the human. Reddit is a place for creating community and belonging, not for attacking marginalized or vulnerable groups of people. Everyone has a right to use Reddit free of harassment, bullying, and threats of violence. Communities and users that incite violence or that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.</a></p>
<hr>
<p>&rt;We do not tolerate the harassment, threatening, or bullying of people on our site; nor do we tolerate communities dedicated to this behavior.</p>
<p>&rt;Reddit is a place for conversation, and in that context, we define this behavior as <strong>anything that works to shut someone out of the conversation through intimidation or abuse, online or off.</strong> Depending on the context, this can take on a range of forms, from directing <strong>unwanted invective at someone to following them from subreddit to subreddit,</strong> just to name a few. <strong>Behavior can be harassing or abusive regardless of whether it occurs in public content (e.g. a post, comment, username, subreddit name, subreddit styling, sidebar materials, etc.) or private messages/chat.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;Being annoying, downvoting, or disagreeing with someone, even strongly, is not harassment. However, <strong>menacing someone, directing abuse at a person or group, following them around the site, encouraging others to do any of these actions, or otherwise behaving in a way that would discourage a reasonable person from participating on Reddit crosses the line.</strong></p>
<p>​https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043071072</p>
<p>The messages users are receiving are 1) unprovoked and 2) based only on the qualifier of their participation in another subreddit. From communicating with a moderator from one of these subreddits, they have admitted that "We also recommend deleting any very recent comments on that subreddit, since if the bot does another sweep very soon, you'll just get banned again."</p>
<p>At least for this particular subreddit, they have admitted that the banning actions are being completed through action of a bot. One would reasonably assume that this is done across all subreddits in question. </p>
<p>Personally, I have been banned from 7 subreddits thus far for participation in this subreddit - 6 of which have the same message verbatim. </p>
<p>The only method you have in protecting yourself from harassment and spam is to report these abusive subreddits. </p>
<h1>To report:</h1>
<p>Click on the following link - https://www.reddit.com/report</p>
<p>Select 'I want to report spam or abuse'</p>
<p>Select 'This is abusive or harassing'</p>
<p>Select 'It's targeted harassment'</p>
<p>Select 'At me'</p>
<p>Please make sure grab the link from the ban message in your inbox. (Not sure if this works on mobile, but if you click on 'permalink' you can grab the url that way on a desktop page). </p>
<p>Leave a comment that you are receiving unwanted, unprovoked messages from subreddits based on other sitewide participation.</p></p>

        <p>this is seriously out of control. I've been banned from 9 just for using this subreddit.  pewdiePie submissions, JusticeServed, Oddly Satisfying, AWW, TIFU, rant, Pics, political humor, and Murica.</p>

        <p>This will do nothing other than draw more attention from the Reddit admins who already want to ban you. </p>
<p>The system doesn't believe this is harrassment, and even if it did it's harrassment that it supports.</p>
<p>The fact that you are in this sub, yet you believe there is some benevolent authority to whom you can appeal is a total oxymoron.</p>
