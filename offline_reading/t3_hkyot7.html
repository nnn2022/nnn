        <p>I've signed tons of petitions and emails before this. I've never ever received a single reply prior to this one. </p>
<p>The letter I sent makes it clear that the science to back up their mask decision is not solid but this councilman does not address those concerns and only re-iterates their regulations to me in the email.  He never addresses the scientific concerns that were well written in the email I submitted.</p>
<p>So here's the creepiest part of this to me.  My bank, car, and driver's license is registered to the address I used.  I voted using this address in their last elections and mailed it from that address.  </p>
<p>Because of this pandemic me and my partner left town only 2 weeks ago to see if life would be better up north for us because he just retired.  I am absolutely baffled as to what this person means that I am not their constituent since I am registered to vote there still.</p>
<p>The only thing I could think of was we are not the property owners of that place - we were staying with friends and paying to stay for almost a year before going north.  I can think of other explanations but any of them creep me out.</p>
<p>I'd like to also mention they attempted to gaslight me twice in this email.  It signs off with "___ stay safe, mask up in public, and please don't spread the disease. Good luck to you and those you come into contact with."  Interesting choice of passive aggressive language.  Thought you guys would like to see what we're up against.  Every day I see a new example of the new world we are apparently moving towards.</p>

        <p>The email I sent had the text that it was sent from One Click Politics.  This was the service used by the person who created the email I used to send from so it was in the footer of the email.  I'll clip the text at the footer.  From what I can tell the service makes it easy to find the right emails to send the emails to once you input your address so they find the right people in the local government to email.  Honestly I think he made fun of the name because he wanted to mock me for supposedly not doing my own research. IMO more gaslighting and passive aggressive verbalization.</p>

<p>Here's the body of the email which I found to be pretty solid - I recently read and viewed Dr. Denis Rancourt's take but honestly I heard long before this from multiple medical doctors they felt the mask mandates can lead to problems and when I worked in a nursing home we never wore masks even if a resident had the flu and only wore gloves for single use things like emptying a catheter and stuff like that.  </p>
<p>&rt; Dear Council Member Hurst,
I am writing to urge you to do your part to make sure that mask-wearing is voluntary, not mandatory.</p>
<p>&rt; Many jurisdictions are basing their face mask policies on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC has flip-flopped its position on face coverings several times since March but is now recommending that everyone wear a mask in public. This recommendation is not supported by strong empirical evidence. Though there is science to support mask-wearing, there’s also a preponderance of science showing that masks can cause considerable harm and are ineffective in preventing the spread of coronavirus. There is also no science supporting the use of masks by healthy individuals. So emergency orders that are being issued to help protect public health are actually hurting individuals’ physical and emotional well being — and violating their basic human rights, constitutional rights and religious rights.</p>
<p>&rt; Evidence that masks reduce the transmission of viral respiratory infections within community settings is equivocal at best. A recent meta-analysis (url) that included nearly a dozen randomized, controlled trials and 10 observational studies found that there was no clear clinical or laboratory-confirmed evidence that masks prevent infection. Even the U.S. Surgeon General has noted that masks “are not effective in preventing the general public from catching the coronavirus.” (url)</p>
<p>&rt; In terms of harm, studies show that wearing a face covering reduces blood and tissue oxygenation — which can be deadly — while increasing carbon dioxide levels. The use of masks can also increase the risk of infection and the spread of viral illness (particularly cloth masks), hinder detoxification that occurs through exhalation, impair the immune system, and cause a wide range other physical and psychological issues. (url). Moreover, some masks have been found to contain known carcinogens, which put people at risk from inhaling toxic chemicals and having them come into contact with their skin.</p>
<p>&rt; There is no science to support the use of masks by healthy individuals, and the World Health Organization backed this up when it said, “WHO stands by recommendations to not wear masks if you are not sick or caring for someone who is sick.” Forcing healthy individuals to wear face coverings is a completely unnecessary intervention that dehumanizes their interactions with others. More important, it eliminates their right to make informed decisions about what risks and precautions they are willing to take.</p>
<p>&rt; It is unethical and unconstitutional to subject healthy, law-abiding citizens to measures that can result in physical and emotional harm and that impinge on their ability to move freely throughout society. For those with deeply held religious beliefs, mask mandates violate their ability to abide by natural law and follow their convictions to walk in faith, not fear. As such, the decision to wear a mask is a highly personal one and should not be universally mandated; measures that are meant to protect the community as a whole are not effective if they hurt individuals in that community.</p>
<p>&rt; Mandatory medicine and mandated interventions such as social distancing and mask-wearing have no place in a free society; citizens want to maintain the right to make responsible decisions about what is best for themselves and their children based on their own unique circumstances. I urge you to do the right thing, stand for choice and protect all individuals by encouraging — not mandating — the use of face masks in the community. This policy can be bolstered by asking at-risk populations and those who are sick to self-quarantine, with society taking the best care of them possible.</p>
<p>&rt; Thank you for your continued leadership during these unprecedented times and for upholding the health and the rights of your constituents.</p>

        <p>Ah sure. I'll send you the actual body that was sent with the links intact.  </p>
<p>I will also send you a great article by Dr. Denis Rancourt where he only analyzed papers that met rigorous scientific criteria (randomized large enough data set etc).</p>
<p>I'm starting to feel like the whole "mask" science is just like the bad science happening around our diet wars.  They use small datasets that make observations look like major things but it is only because anything observable appears more causative than it really is. They use this tactic all the time in the diet wars - also blurring the lines are the cofactors that can influence health like exercise, gosh even eating non-GMO, organic, or living in a non-agricultural pesticide exposed area - they don't properly account for a lot of these factors in these studies and to be quite honest may be impossible to account for these factors.  So the diet papers are always a mess.</p>
<p>The mask papers feel like this to me as well.</p>
<p>Here's a great quote from <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-infection/article/face-masks-to-prevent-transmission-of-influenza-virus-a-systematic-review/64D368496EBDE0AFCC6639CCC9D8BC05/core-reader">this article</a>:
&rt; Current research has several limitations including underpowered samples, limited generalizability, narrow intervention targeting and inconsistent testing protocols, different laboratory methods, and case definitions.</p>

        <p>another point you can make in these letters is that you support the idea of voluntary mask wearing but worry about the unintended consequences of having the police enforce this. </p>
<p>How much would the police force have to grow in a time when many are calling for defunding. Where is the proof this won’t unfairly target minorities?</p>

        <p>I believe I saw a news article go by (wish I had saved it now) on this very issue.  Originally Oregon was not going to enforce mask mandates for minorities but this got squashed when the governor reissued the mask mandates.  I feel like I remember that article talking about a robbery and a mask and a minority but now I can't remember it so I wonder if a narrative is being spun around this now but we'll see if that becomes a pattern.</p>

        <p>Could they have been looking at your iPhone address to assume you aren’t a resident, or does the service not show that?  </p>
<p>Maybe follow up with a hand written letter. Include a copy of your voter card. And include some science links. There’s always that asymptomatic people don’t tend to spread it.</p>

        <p>I did think about that but I don't see anywhere in that email that would show this.  I'm currently using a vpn so they would have to know what IP address I was working from and that kind of requires more access than just seeing my email address.  If I'm not wrong you have to subpoena for those kinds of records and I don't think that.</p>
<p>If they can access the IP I'm working from that easily I'm more concerned about that than just this little snarky letter.</p>
