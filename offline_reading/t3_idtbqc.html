    <strong>Start tipping extra and leaving positive feedback for businesses that aren't pestering non-masked customers</strong>
    <p><p>Been trying to do this lately. </p>
<p>Part of the battle is businesses taking the lead and making a stand against the states that need their tax dollars. </p>
<p>The best way you can send that message to businesses isn't by being a 'Karen', (for lack of a better term) but to make it known to businesses that you feel welcomed, that you are going to make an effort to refer others to them, and that you will start giving them more business over other similar establishments specifically because of the science they support by their relaxed atmospheres (despite actual evidence they actually don't really care or the procedures of reminding a customer to wear a mask before serving was most likely just forgotten). </p>
<p>You can do this by going to their website where they will either have a feedback/experience form, if they're big chains, or an email if they're smaller. If you can't find either, google reviews or yelp is a good option. </p>
<p>It's also important to leave good sized tips for servers that don't pester you about wearing a mask for 15 feet to your table or if you're just picking up an order. </p>
<p>There's a caveat: don't write on the receipt. Those can be kept as records and if an employee is not asking customers to wear masks, that can cost them their job if caught by their managers. If you want to write them a note about the great experience they gave you, bring a small note pad and write it out separately so that it can be easily tossed, rather than it being sent to managers where punishment could happen for that employee. </p>
<p>I would then suggest to give very non-specific, anonymous feedback to the business like, 'I was here sometime last week and I just want to thank you for the professionalism and fantastic service for allowing us to eat in your establishment without asking us to wear masks. Thank you for embracing science and individual choice. Great environment and better food &amp; servers! Will refer family and friends here!' </p>
<p>Don't mention employees by name right now. That could potentially get them fired. </p>
<p><strong>Let's be more appreciative of these non-masked businesses and their employees (intentional or otherwise) and hopefully it will send a clear message to the business that this is what consumers want. But make sure it's safe for the employee.</strong></p>
<p>('positive' pun was not intended haha)</p></p>

        <p>That makes me sad to hear that. The list of places I would consider moving to in this country gets shorter every day.</p>
<p>I am from California originally, and part of me wants to move back home at some point. But in terms of politics, home fell off the list of places I would consider living long ago.</p>

        <p>This. Just give them a positive review or be careful with your wording. For instance:</p>
<p>ABC restaurant had wonderful food, great drinks, and friendly staff! A great place to do for a quick bite and a very laid back atmosphere. 10/10</p>

        <p>The true face of authoritarianism has been unmasked, revealing itself as the imposition of a living death for all, no doubt eventually followed by death itself if its anti-human values are left to run wild to their logical conclusion. Of course in real life pushback from those who are not willing to follow the cult of the state unto death will stop it before it reaches that end point, but it is what we are all dealing with here.</p>

        <p>Excellent advice. Good behavior should be praised and rewarded where it is found. Do it quite privately, though, to minimize the threat of retaliation that would nullify the reward they get for acting like decent human beings.</p>

        <p>I've been doing this.  I have a few local restaurants who don't harass me and I try to reward them for it.  My eyes have been opened to the problem of patronizing large corporate businesses (and restaurants).  I never "got it" before, but now I understand why communities don't want these outsiders taking over.  Unfortunately this realization came to me too late.</p>

        <p>Do you really think people working minimum wage McJobs should be expected to risk catching a deadly disease at work (or transmitting it to their friends and family) just so that a tiny minority of customers like you don't feel 'pestered'. I'm sure it would be pretty easy to convince your hungover 18-year old server that masks are a waste of time #YOLO but that doesn't mean it is the right thing to do. </p>
<p>This kind of stuff is why the anti-mask crowd are perceived as entitled assholes and Karens.</p>

        <p>Like I said, this 'fuck you I got mine' attitude is why people think you lot are just selfish dickheads trying to dress this selfishness up as 'rugged individualism'. </p>
<p>It is our moral responsibility as good citizens and good human beings to protect the vulnerable from the virus by limiting its spread with social distancing, good hygiene and masks.</p>

        <p>You’ve failed to answer my question and provide any evidence. You’ve resorted to name calling (a common trait of “moral warriors”)
Please tell me this moral obligation are you are talking of? When before have you been responsible for me and my family? </p>
<p>Have you spoken to any “vulnerable people”? Asked their opinions? Do they want you to be their nappy? </p>
<p>Every elderly person I have seen and spoken to have made their own decisions, taken their own precautions and been adamant they don’t want anyone limiting their life for them. Not to mention my behaviour toward them (giving them a wide berth and refusing handshakes). </p>
<p>Honestly if I wasn’t so baffled and disappointed by your line of thinking I’d be rolling on the floor laughing.</p>

        <p>You can also eat elsewhere. Are u going to buy them a suit?? If these ppl get sick others aren't going to replace them as seen with all the available jobs and big a#s hiring signs everywhere. Others not wearing masks is a huge reason why people won't take these jobs and it slows down everything opening up as we fail the test.  Even with no more cares stimulus, majority wont take those jobs. Food workers that don't wear masks are often the ones that also don't follow proper kitchen hygeine either.  If u willingly wear shoes and shirt , a mask  which saves lives shouldn't be an issue.</p>
