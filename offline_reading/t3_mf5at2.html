    <strong>People of England, please don't give up hope</strong>
    <p><p>I know the title might sound quite melodramatic, but hear me out; I live in a decent sized city and pretty much every day, I cycle past the local park. On a good day (the weather hasn't been too bad the for the past week), the park is rammed; there was families having picnics, children in the play area, even some outdoor refreshment places open. </p>
<p>In other words, the way things should be.</p>
<p>I'm seriously am starting to think the general public is on our side; they are, however, mostly afraid to say anything, because Twitter gives a megaphone to upper - class Leftist ingrates, who couldn't give a rodent's rectum about the future of the younger generation (or the elderly, for that matter).</p>
<p>So, although the situation is bleak, it's not completely hopeless, there are tons of people living thier lives and defying these restrictions (I've gathered with friends many times and taken alot of non - essential train journeys). I can only apply this to England and not the other parts of the UK because I don't really know the situation on Scotland / NI / Wales (although I do praise the Welsh for allowing barbers to open early). </p>
<p>Keep the fight going!</p></p>

<p>I started using Twitter during the plandemic. I had been told the place was bad, but it's a total cesspool.</p>

        <p>It is heartening to see, I'm sure the shops will be rammed when they open, but I'm worried they will shrug and take the vaccine because they don't see it as much of a bother, then they'll shrug and accept vaccine passports without a fight because it doesn't exclude them. I'm glad they're not scared of the virus anymore but I'm worried they don't care about right and wrong so long as they can somehow go to the pub and go on their beach holiday.</p>
