    <strong>Questions for this sub from an intrigued outsider.</strong>
    <p><p>I have made a poll for this sub, I am genuinely interested in the answers. First a little introduction about where I am coming from with these questions. Skip to the bottom to read the actual question.  </p>
<p>So this is kind of a strange sub to be rolling into for me. I live in a severely COVID affected part of Europe, many of the people around me have had Covid-19, most of them young, with only mild symptoms, some with lasting consequences (permanent lung damage), none dead. My personal business has suffered from lockdown, but I remain convinced that this lockdown is just necessary to stop hospitals from being flooded. The way it was rolled out and maintained by local politicians has been frustrating, but I blame that on general rampant incompetence and not to bad intentions. I do believe my government has every intention of moving out of lockdown eventually, but is just botching the COVID response and the general communication around said response.</p>
<p>I too am skeptical about term "the new normal". I refuse to except that this is a normal state of the world, but I don't see that as a reason to not comply with lockdown measures. Most of this isn't new either. We've had pandemics before, we've had mask mandates before, we've had conspiracies before, it's just that most of us weren't around last time this happened. It's just new to us and some of the results (a massive shift to annoying online "living", for example) are specifically of this time. I believe this time will pass and we will return to a society that is truly "normal". I want to specifically stress that I do not believe this "normal" is the same as before COVID. Some of the changes we've seen during this pandemic will remain. Laws surrounding quick and local mask mandates will probably remain. Online streaming will have become more normal even when it is not a necessity. Confidence in science will remain eroded even when, after all scientists can look back and analyze the massive amounts of data from this pandemic, we can clearly look back and see what happened and what worked. If anything, the term "The New Normal" should be reserved for the changed times once this pandemic is over.</p>
<p>But this sub is something else. The degree of skepticism in this sub is waaaaay beyond my skepticism. To me (a European, leftwing, academically schooled millenial entrepreneur) looks like a conspiracy gateway sub. I can see the merits of this sub (mainly just venting frustration with lockdown measures, which I think is very valid and valuable), but some of the opinions I read here seem to be founded on believes I ABSOLUTELY do not share, such as Covid denialism, mask effectiveness denialism and the general obsession this sub seems to have with labeling people that comply to lockdown orders as sheep or doomers. I hope the namecalling and gatekeeping in the comments is kept to a minimum. Even when discussing differences in beliefs, I hope this discussion can remain civil.</p>
<p>Which leads me to my question: <strong>Why do you object "the new normal"?</strong></p>
<p>I will try and add as many poll options here as I can think of, but since I cannot change them after posting, these will probably not reflect the discussion in the comments.</p>
<p>P.S. My vote goes out to "I believe part of the measures my government took were right, but other parts were not". Closing down small businesses was the right thing to do, bars were the biggest places of infection in my country. Not supporting these small businesses, but opting to massively support big corporations instead, was the wrong move and has left many rightfully frustrated and/or bankrupt. That's just my two cents, I am genuinely interested in hearing your answers.</p>

<p>Technique #4 - 'INFORMATION COLLECTION'</p>
<p>&rt;Information collection is also a very effective method to determine the psychological level of the forum members, and to gather intelligence that can be used against them. In this technique in a light and positive environment a 'show you mine so me yours' posting is initiated. From the number of replies and the answers that are provided much statistical information can be gathered. An example is to post your 'favourite weapon' and then encourage other members of the forum to showcase what they have. In this matter it can be determined by reverse proration what percentage of the forum community owns a firearm, and or a illegal weapon. This same method can be used by posing as one of the form members and posting your favourite 'technique of operation.' From the replies various methods that the group utilizes can be studied and effective methods developed to stop them from their activities.</p>

<p>Edit: thanks for adding the source of what you're quoting. But then I have a question for you: what do I, a dude in Europe, have to gain from "controlling" this sub? Like really? I don't intend to become an insider here, as I quite very content with being an outsider...</p>

<p>This does not explicitly explain anything because it fails to explain WHY I would use any of this against anyone. I don't have anything to gain here (not even karma), I am just curious. Stop being so paranoid.</p>

        <p>&rt;19. Ignore proof presented, demand impossible proofs. This is perhaps a variant of the 'play dumb' rule. Regardless of what material may be presented by an opponent in public forums, claim the material irrelevant and demand proof that is impossible for the opponent to come by</p>

        <p>You are framing this entire conversation as me being a antagonist, an opponent, a spy without presenting a shred of evidence for that claim other than the fact that information collection is a possible strategy for antagonists. Honestly that feels kind of rude.  </p>
<p>I am not ignoring any proof you claim to have (which so far is only the fact that information collection is apparently a tactic used by forum spies) but refuting it by showing you my motive: lazy curiosity. Unless you can present a credible alternative motive, such as a practical method of control of this sub (do you really think this poll will make a difference in the general consensus in this sub?! I don't have such high hopes) or a credible motive (such as a specific benefit I would get from posting this poll, or having any control over the narrative here), you are the one that is ignoring the proof I presented and demanding impossible proof (the only proof I can give you is the absence of any proof for me being a spy, which is not valid proof as absence of evidence is not evidence of absence).</p>

        <p>What makes you think the vaccines are bullshit? The effectivity rate of a vaccine is the literal empirically proven rate for preventing a disease. Do you have a paper proving the effectiveness of zinc, vitamin D &amp; C and, more importantly, is that rate above the rate of vaccines? Because honestly I think that, even though zinc and vitamins D &amp; C have an impact, that impact is negligible compared to a 95% vaccine effectiveness</p>

        <p>Doing science costs money, that does not mean it's for sale. In fact, most fraud in science is the result of researchers having to publish to keep their shitty salary. If science was truly for sale, researchers wouldn't be so poor. Just try living off of a PHD salary.</p>
<p>As for the 20 to 1, in that specific interview that is used to propagate this false story, Gates is talking the value vaccines provide TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT VACCINATE. For every 1 dollar Gates spends on a vaccine program, the community he gives that vaccine to SAVES 20 dollars on healthcare costs because people don't get sick. That's individual vaccinated people not having to pay hospital bills, not profit Bill Gates earns.</p>

        <p>Honestly I expected more Covid deniers in this sub too...</p>
<p>And I agree on that the effectiveness of masks is very debatable, honestly I hope that after this pandemic is over we can have some rigorous studies to settle this debate. On a personal level, I feel like if I have asymptomatic Covid and I sneeze in a public space, a mask will capture some of the aerosols I sneeze out and this prevent some of the spread. It's all statistical and definitely not a panacea, but saying it's absolutely not effective is also kind of shortsighted.</p>

        <p>Ok but don’t just assume “everyone here denies covid” theirs a few but it’s the minority </p>
<p>But also the evidence of asymptomatic spread is very weak which makes healthy people wearing masks kinda pointless as when you sneeze or cough you do it into your elbow</p>

        <p>Not what I assumed, hence the question and multiple options (which don't cover all options, but I was maxed out). The spread among these is quite revealing about the breadth of sentiments in this sub.</p>
<p>As for your point on asymptomatic spread being very debatable, very much agreed, but among the people I have seen get Covid, most of them got it from people that were not sick at the time of meeting them. It's just anecdotal (and I guess can vary quite a lot between regions at the virus can mutate slightly with every new infection) but were I live seems to be quite significant.</p>

        <p>you're absolutely welcome to stay around here and ask as many questions as you like - we don't bite! (hard)</p>
<p>but uhhh... here's a friendly pro-tip: it comes off a wee bit pretentious if you introduce yourself like "a European, leftwing, academically schooled millennial entrepreneur."</p>
<p>most of us don't describe ourselves in such highfalutin terms. for example, i'm an Xennial American, a classical liberal with a masters degree, currently engaged as a parasitic bureaucrat. but on here i'm just an exasperated thirty-something extrovert desperate to break out of lockdown and burn it all down in a fiery heap.</p>
<p>don't talk down to people - it's not our thing.</p>

        <p>Honestly I can see how you'd think that was pretentious, but it wasn't intended to talk down to anyone. Rather, it can help people, if they are so inclined and even mildly interested, to better understand why I might hold the views I have.</p>
<p>And for the record, I rather like having a sense of what background people have, so thanks for sharing. I do think lockdown is a lot harder for extroverts.</p>

        <p>I'd go for the word paranoid instead to be honest...
I am a pretentious dick in real life too. You can dislike that and you can dislike me for that, but it does not make me a spy.</p>
<p>Edit: thought this was in a different comment thread, hence the spy comment. I can see how the first paragraph could have been enough info, but I felt I needed to clarify my own point of view for the sake of nuance.</p>
