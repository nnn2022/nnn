        <p>This whole thread made my skin crawl. </p>
<p>People saying that the owner of the business should be audited and have any covid funding taken way for the anti mask sign posted in his store (it was a dumb sign tbf, but come on...) That he should lose his business. And if you have a problem with wearing a mask you should stay home forever. You don't deserve to make a living.</p>
<p>Several posters calling anyone who voiced concerns about mask mandates "Plague rats." </p>
<p>Another poster said "I hope you realize how much the majority of <strong><em>*country</em></strong>* hate people like you. 'Ma freedom is more important than the lives of others.' You disgust me, to my core. You have no home in this sub, you should feel alienated for your beliefs. Don't like it? Go move to a "free world" where you can't be bothered by others but don't expect to get anything back either. Mic drop, I am out of here you disgusting so called human."</p>
<p>The comment that I took a screenshot of made a good point with respect to the individual choice, because if you know PPE (yknow, PERSONAL protective equipment) you know masks don't work to protect others. You wear them to protect your person. People who are scared have every right to wear PPE. People who are confident in their immune system shouldn't have to stay home forever and lose their livelihood. Almost 70 comments, and almost all were supporting this outlook.</p>
<p>This is a whole new level of not normal.</p>

<p>Expect this kind of thing to be ramped up the longer this continues, especially from the media. People who don't wear masks. People who won't take the vaccine. They will be considered plague rats and superspreaders. </p>

        <p>Did you really just compare yourself to an extremely brutal genocide? Just because you have to wear a mask when you're around other people? It has been known since we discovered germs and modern sanitation that masks prevent spread of germs from your lungs through your mouth and nose.</p>

        <p>I’m going to be nice and explain it to you in good faith instead of just downvoting you: the comparison with Rwanda isn’t based on the fact of asking people to wear masks, it’s based on the fact of calling people plague rats and so-called humans. Using dehumanizing language like that creates a climate where violence seems acceptable. Smart people proactively condemn dehumanizing language instead of waiting for the violence to happen and then going “Oh shit, a genocide.”</p>

        <p>I appreciate the level headed response. However I think there is a huge difference between what is going on with people who believe in covid and anti-maskers. For one, you all are not being called "plague rats"(not that I agree with this practice as I believe it alienates people who might otherwise wear a mask) because of your race, religion or something that you can't change that is unrelated to disease. You are being called a plague rat because you are actively deciding to spread the virus.</p>

        <p>I understand the distinction that you're making, but I'm not more okay with politically-motivated violence than I am with ethnic or religious violence. And that's inevitably what's going to happen if this hateful language gets popular. You might see a person who's not wearing a mask as "actively deciding to spread the virus," but that's a political belief on your part.</p>

        <p>By that logic you should be just as angry with Nazi's, a political regime that by all measures of the word were are are discriminated against, being violently prosecuted as you would be with Jews. Political positions are chosen, and just like all opinions should be debated, and when they are wrong, and especially as wrong as Nazism, vehemently opposed.(Not calling you a nazi, just am pulling a parallel based on your logic)</p>
<p>On my opinion that people like you actively spread the virus, what other conclusion would I make, and why is that a "political" belief?</p>

        <p>I'm not talking about vehement opposition, I'm talking about dehumanizing language. Using dehumanizing language against people for their political beliefs is not part of democratic debate or discourse about public policy in a civil society. This conversation is about calling people plague rats and so-called humans, remember?</p>
<p>I'm not sure what you're referring to here by Nazis being "violently prosecuted;" the only thing that that can mean to me is the Nuremberg Trials and death sentences, which is way beyond the scope of what I'm interested in talking about this morning, except to mention that the Nuremberg Trials closed a process that began with calling people vermin and sub-human.</p>

        <p>You have a fair point about dehumanizing language, which I agree on. My point is anti maskers, who are choosing to spread the virus, the word "plague rat" is an accurate descripter of their actions. </p>
<p>Dehumanizing language in general is harmful, but that is only because it is most often directed at people that can't change, and used as a descripter when there is no real basis. Black people being called "plague rats" is horrible, because there is no reason why a black person specifically would be called that besides simply racism.</p>
<p>Someone spreading a virus, and choosing to do so, I have no problems with using "plague rat" as a descripter. The woman who was put in jail for spreading HIV, was also called a plague rat. Do you have an issue with that? </p>
<p>And again, why is that "belief" political?</p>
<p>On a side note, I truly appreciate your etiquette in this debate, and if you are taking offense to what I am saying please know that is not my intention. "Debates" these days mostly includes people yelling insults from across the table, which is 100% not effective at coming to a good answer/conclusion, or keeping society together.</p>

        <p>A couple points, if I may. I'm not the person you were speaking to before, so that's just a disclaimer.</p>
<p>&rt;who are choosing to spread the virus</p>
<p>This is where, I think, a majority of this debate sprung from. Most, if not all, of this subreddit believe that masks are ineffective in spreading the virus, meaning that anybody coming into contact with anyone else is, in effect, "choosing to spread the virus." </p>
<p>Your entire argument fails if you were to subscribe to the theory that masks do not work (and it is a theory, irregardless. Much like evolution is a theory, so is the belief that masks do not work. So is the belief that masks do work, for that matter.) As for evidence to back this theory up, I'm sure there are a plethora of sources and studies one can find on this sub - since I'm on mobile I can't really show them to you.</p>
<p>But ignore this disparity in the theories you and the other members of this sub believe. Moving on:</p>
<p>&rt;people that can't change</p>
<p>I cannot breathe while wearing a mask. I have no diagnosed medical condition, though. Make of that what you will, but tell me, would you consider me a "plague rat" for not wearing a mask?</p>
<p>&rt;Do you have an issue with that?</p>
<p>I do not. The other person may, but I personally do not - I would consider this down to a rather subtle distinction. HIV is long-lasting, denigrating, and above all, terminal in a sizeable proportion of cases. Spreading HIV (with the awareness that you are positive) involves doing something actively. Specifically, having sexual intercourse with someone. Notice how the woman chose to disregard long-standing awareness of the effects of the disease, and actively attempted to spread it.</p>
<p>Now, I posit: do you think anyone in this sub would be actively walking around with a mask, with the intention of spreading the virus, with the knowledge that they were positive? If a person exists, they are a plague rat. Someone unaware of whether they have the virus, or someone who spreads the virus unintentionally - they are absolutely not plague rats, in the sense of the woman who spread HIV. Of course, this is ignoring the fact that COVID-19 has a 99.98% survival rate, a number that increases for younger people. </p>
<p>I take issue with your argument about "choosing to spread the virus." I would hazard a guess that almost nobody in this sub wants other people to contract the virus. They may be apathetic, but they are absolutely not "choosing to do so." </p>
<p>&rt;why is that "belief" political</p>
<p>Tom Wolf, the governor of Pennsylvania, said that masks were nothing but political posturing (or something to that effect) off camera a couple days ago. Make your conclusions from that, if you will. Science should not be political - but inherently, it is. Research depends on grants and those grants are influenced by politics and prestige. Being for and against masks are now political positions, just like how the support for gender-transitioning surgery for minors is. It should not be, I think we would find common ground there, but it is. The powers that be have willed it, lol.</p>
<p>I'm sorry for ~such~ a massive fucking text dump lol, but I hope I was clear and made sense (or how much ever sense I can make to you).</p>

        <p>It wasn't. Even during the 1300s and 1400s, plague doctors wore rudimentary masks to both, smell herbs and spices rather than dead bodies, and to prevent themselves from getting the disease. When germ theory and modern sanitation science was founded in the 1800s, doctors began to wear masks and wash their hands before surgeries to prevent infections. Then in the 1900s during the Spanish flu, people both voluntarily and were mandated to wear masks in the US.</p>

        <p>That works fantastically for diseases that are always symptomatic. The fact is most diseases aren't, including coronavirus. So when you get infected in some random chance encounter without knowing about it, you prevent yourself from spreading it to people who might be more terminally infected. Unless you are trying to say that you can account for every single cell in your body.</p>

        <p>Contracts are agreements signed by both parties. The contract cannot change without agreement by both parties. If one party changes the contract, the entire contract is null. </p>
<p>The "social contract" is entirely one-sided. The government decides what the people must give and it also decides what it will give in return. If the people give as required in their end of the contract, there's nothing preventing the government from giving less with no impact.</p>

        <p>Like many of the language games of the left, it is a negation of the trems. "Social contract" means government diktat. "Social justice" means punishing innocent individuals who are part of the wrong group. "Inclusivity" and "diversity" means the exlcusion of any wrongthink, iedeological conformity and rootless cosmopolitanism.</p>

        <p>"Latinx"? That's not the proper grammatical way to address all Latinos, never mind the fact that this neologism is gibberish to a native Spanish speaker.</p>
<p>The proper way to refer to all Lations is with, well, "Latino". In Spanish, the male -o suffix can mean a male thing just as much as it can mean a group of things, regardless of what "gender" they're arbitrarily provided in Spanish grammar.</p>
<p>"Latinx" is just a made-up progressive buzzword that I'm pretty sure would be completely unheard of outside of the United States. It's like "wxmen" in English, which, again, nobody uses, because it's another made-up progressive buzzword that tries to be "inclusive" but fails miserably.</p>

        <p>I have no idea. Progressives probably claimed that the term "Hispanic" was too alienating, so they changed it to "Latinx".</p>
<p>From what I've heard, however, most Hispanic Americans in the United States prefer to be referred to by the demonym of the country their heritage stems from (i.e., Mexican, Colombian, etc.) rather than by something generic like "Latinx".</p>
<p>It's so confusing. Why do we need an entire cheesy neologism just to refer to a collective race of people without the arbitrary fear of "triggering" someone? Have these people never heard of GENDERED LANGUAGES before? Here's a hint: most languages on the face of the Earth gender just about everything in their language. How unaware of the world must you be to use a term like "Latinx"?</p>
