    <strong>Last night I was visited by three ghosts: the Ghost of Covid Past, the Ghost of Covid Present and the Ghost of Covid Yet To Come!! I AM NOW A CHANGED MAN!!</strong>
    <p><p>Grandma was dead, to begin with. There was no doubt whatever about that. But as I rifled through her belongings and drawers in her now eerily empty home in a desperate, pitiful search for inheritance money and cherished family heirlooms that I could hawk for my own selfish gain a spectral figure resembling my deceased grandmother appeared before me. I was barely peturbed and carried on pillaging her bedside cabinet for loose change.</p>
<p>"Biscuittttt..." an ethereal voice trembled from her ghostly lips, barely audible over the howling wind outside.</p>
<p>"Fuck off, Nan, I'm busy!" I waved her away like a bad fart.</p>
<p>"You killed me... with Covid!" she screeched. "You didn't get the heckin' vaccineee...!"</p>
<p>I must admit, lads, I was a bit fucking spooked at this point so I decided to bolt it for the nearest pub where I got fucking wrecked with my Republican mates and we swapped Qanon conspiracy theories about 5G, microchips and the Flat Earth. Some people entered the pub wearing masks and we all immediately started barking at them and hurling slurs and insults until they scurried away in terror. Felt pretty good, not gonna lie. You all know how it is.</p>
<p>Anyway after about twelve pints and a couple jager bombs (only a few I'm not a fucking alky) I staggered out onto the street, coughing and spluttering at passersby and making sure to lick every lamp post on my way home. I was wearing my "Unvaccinated and Proud!" t-shirt and MAGA hat so everyone parted like the red sea whenever I approached them on the pavement. I'm all for causing trouble, I am.</p>
<p>I passed out on my bed after watching 4 hours of InfoWars and eating a dirty kebab. When I awoke it was to the sound of rattling chains. I had a splitting headache and judging by the smell I'd evidently shat myself during my boozy slumber. Through bleary, sleep-crusted eyes I peered out at and was shocked to see the ghosts of 600,000 dead Americans gathered around my bed as ghostly apparitions. They all had ventilators affixed permanently to their sunken, ghoulish faces.</p>
<p>"YOU DID THIS." they chanted in unison, their judging voices unobstructed by the tubes in their throats. "YOU DIDN'T WEAR A MASK AND YOU SPREAD MISINFORMATION ON NO NEW NORMAL."</p>
<p>I had a lump in my throat at this point and I was beginning to sweat. Like a BLM rally, the ghosts were mostly peaceful and I had no reason to believe they'd attack me but there was a menacing quality to them. Before I could plead my case they disappeared in a poof of smoke. <em>Thank fuck that's over with</em> I thought to myself.</p>
<p>Before I could put my head down for another forty winks though the spirit of the NHS, embodied in several dancing phantoms adorned in nurse uniforms and performing the Macarena, appeared before me. One of them pointed a bony, transparent finger at me and showed me a vision of patients currently dying in hospitals across the Globe from Covid.</p>
<p>The lead ghost clambered towards me, her jaw unhinged and eyes blazing brightly in the darkness. She crept right up to my ear and whispered in it, almost perversely: "One of the last things they do before they're intubated is beg me for the vaccine. I hold their hand and tell them that I'm sorry, but it's too late."</p>
<p>I felt something fucking grip my hand and my head whipped to the side to face her but she was gone. I was really bricking it now, folks. Finally, the haunting figure of Dr. Fauci, resplendent in a lab coat and carrying a beaker full of Science<strong>‚Ñ¢</strong> , sizzled into existence at the foot of my bed like someone in Star Trek getting beamed down in the transporter. He lectured me on wearing a mask, getting the vaccine, and the dangers of the Delta variant. It was a bit fucking boring if I'm being honest and kind of an anti-climax after all the other spooky ghosts and nightmarish imagery but whatever, I was sold.</p>
<p>My alarm clock rang and I sat bolt upright in bed. My sheets were clean and I had no hangover. Was it all a dream? Was it real? Who gives a fuck, I thought. I booked myself in for a jab and ran to the window and cried out to a small child, no more than six years old, playing on the street: "You there, boy! Have you been vaccinated!?" The kid looked up at me like I was fucking crazy. "Don't just stand there gawking, boy! Get the heckin' jab! Do it for your grandma!"</p>
<p>I sprinted out my front door and barreled my way down to the nearest vaccination centre. I couldn't fucking wait. I barged through the queue and got my first Pfizer jab. Anyway I'm back at home now and I'm shivering like fuck, my brain feels like it's full of blood and I'm pretty sure I just imagined all of that waffle I just wrote as some sort of bizarre Pfizer fever dream. At least... at least I won't get Covid now, right...? Right?</p></p>
