    <strong>They will never win , even if we loose</strong>
    <p><p>We were told mask were dangerous and not effective.
Yet they still mask.
We were told social distance and sanitary etiquette was. temporary .
Yet they make it religious.
We were told lockdowns and curfews were temporary .
Yet we are still in 'Lockstep'.
We were told 2 mRNA shots were 'freedom tickets'.
Yet they ask for booster shots.
We were told QR vaccine health passports are "just like any ID".
Yet worst QR social systems already exists .</p>
<p>Now we are told the unvaccinated people are a threat to society .
Yet the vaccinated are more sick .</p>
<p>And according to few dissident people in the medical field ,
like the inventor of mRNA vaccine technology Dr Robert Malone for example , 
The mass vaccination campaign is creating mass <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody-dependent_enhancement">antibody-dependence enhancement</a> , and is a very likely source of new variants.</p>
<p>So even if humanity panics and kills all the healthy people ,
they still will be sickening themselves and find new culprits to blame amongst themselves.</p></p>
