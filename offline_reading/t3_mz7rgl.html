    <strong>In Canada, the greatest mistake I see is the denial of intentionality</strong>
    <p><p><em>"Oh, the government doesn't really mean that"</em> / <em>"This is all one big mistake"</em> / <em>"They're just relying on faulty statistics and have tunnel vision"</em> / <em>"Due process will prevail"</em></p>
<p>Will lead to:</p>
<p><em>"wait and see, we can cut a deal"</em> / <em>"If we just keep spreading facts and science policymakers will come around"</em> / <em>"You shouldn't be worried, this is all an overreaction which will naturally correct"</em></p>
<p>The complacent middle class and government-connected middlemanagers (synonymous in this bankrupt country) love to use this line of thinking. It connects to the theatrics of lower level policymaking and feeds into the comfy rationalizational <em>"It couldn't happen here"</em>,  justifying their kowtow to the government line with occasional irrelevant dissent. It also means the population is still docile and cattlized, at the mercy of any state violence.</p>
<p>The problem is, it isn't true. Move beyond the irrelevant politics of city councils, journalists and shopkeepers, and Covid policy cannot possible be just "one big accident". There are clear signs of intentional gaslighting and psychopathy in the politically-connected elite. No level of due process and debate is going to change the minds of the Canadian ruling class, that'd require the regime to be arguing from a position of good faith.</p>
<p>Consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Government knows the death rate does not line up with official claims, But still fabricates data using "cases" to mislead</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Government has known the PCR testing method is flawed and appears to freely manipulate testing rates to fabricate lockdown rationales</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Government knows Lockdowns are causing supreme suffering and destruction in Canada, and doesn't care. In fact doesn't even address these claims and wants more of the same (because they win once there are political police regardless of covid)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Premiers and health ministers across the country have repeatedly made gaffes indicating they aren't in control of policy. Ford and Ontario health ministers have even inadvertently said so on camera. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To drum up fear of the "variant pandemic" health ministers are now saying completely ludicrous things like banning outdoor activities, public exercise, shopping for everyday items at the grocery store. All using the carrot and stick of lockdowns and vaccines to clearly drive an unwilling public towards their desired outcome</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every single crisis in this sham "pandemic" has been driven by top-down government policy, which then has whipped up a fake media frenzy to astroturf the appearance of consent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The only acceptable outcome the regime is willing to accept are vaccination passports. This was supposed to be a conspiracy in state media a year ago.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What has been the outcome? Radicalization of the police, repeated violation of laws until they are meaningless, repression of dissidents, scapegoat campaigns to polarize the population. Synonymous with any totalitarian state. I don't know how anyone politically active right now can look at the pattern of behavior coming from the regime and think this isn't anything other than a malevolent conspiracy.  People have to stop believing illusions</p></p>

        <p>And shattering the worldview is an extremely painful process, so it makes total sense they will hold on to that for as long as possible. Burying your head in the sand and hope it just goes away only makes things worse. At some point, people HAVE to wake up. It’s inevitable.</p>

        <p>Hmmm the government doesn’t actually have our best interest in heart? That human beings are fundamentally selfish and create various ways of control to dominate others? Like religion? What if Hell was just made up to scare you?</p>

        <p>As a fellow Canadian I agree 100% with your post.  Last March when this was new and no one knew much about Covid I gave them the benefit of the doubt.  Then a few months passed and we started learning more about the virus and yet government policy more or less stayed the same instead of changing based on what they learned.  Now it seems some provinces are locking down further despite the evidence that lockdowns were never necessary and certainly not needed now.  It is hard for me to believe government's response is merely incompetence.</p>

        <p>Great...so what?</p>
<p>Nothing new, they just have more tools and they're going to use them. </p>
<p>Who are you helping? The brainwashed youth who want to see racism and sexism behind every corner or the around 20% of the workforce that is the government. Or the pensioners just trying to scrape by or the welfare recipients and the folks begging for a UBI?</p>
<p>You'll find out how they feel about your help pretty quick. They will hate you for telling them the truth and love those who lie to them. Why not just get paid and sell it lock, stock and barrel? </p>
<p>You say people need to stop believing illusions, but have given folks nothing to believe instead. When you take away someone's sense of understanding, you have alienated them and they will seek out what is familiar even though they know it's not true. That's the end of 1984. </p>
<p>Folks will revert to the hierarchy that they have until they have another one to revert to.</p>

        <p>That's misdirection. I wouldn't need to give you a rationalization for the implications of truth either way.</p>
<p>But think about it, the real problem is we have the numbers right now already but they're not radical enough to commit and wait idly as if letters of outrage are sufficient to end a dictatorship. The reason is that they don't know the stakes and are clinging to the illusions of due process.</p>
<p>Groups of outraged people, active all the time, unwilling to compromise to the illusions, have a far greater impact on the thinking of dictatorships than these laughable weekly donut marches.  We are not going to succeed until large numbers of people respect no ultimatum with the government</p>
