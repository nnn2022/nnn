    <strong>Up Until Now Vaccines That Killed FIFTY Were Pulled Off the Market - Now It's THOUSANDS! This Is Unprecedented</strong>
    <p><p>Vaccines were pulled off the market once there was over FIFTY people who died from them, that's the standard, not FIVE THOUSAND- source @ 13 minutes in:<br>
<a href="https://thenewamerican.com/covid-shot-killing-large-numbers-warns-top-covid-doc-peter-mccullough/?fbclid=IwAR3h4nzbn4h3t-mOlx3kk_KVvgGb-HD6_y9-Ft-_NtAjbFpiYSVs-W6Ngc">https://thenewamerican.com/covid-shot-killing-large-numbers-warns-top-covid-doc-peter-mccullough/?fbclid=IwAR3h4nzbn4h3t-mOlx3kk_KVvgGb-HD6_y9-Ft-_NtAjbFpiYSVs-W6Ngc</a>k ..and if it Harvard medical's study from 2010 is correct, VAERS only represents just ONE PERCENT of total deaths, that's HALF A MILLION DEAD IN JUST A FEW MONTHS. Name one other product that has directly caused the deaths of even 5,000 PEOPLE and left on the market let alone HALF A MILLION!!!! AND JUST IN A HANDFUL OF MONTHS. It's CLEAR they've either made a horrific mistake or trying to EXTERMINATE us and judging from the way they are working overtime to burying the vaccine death information and threaten anyone who tries to expose it, it's looking like the latter.</p></p>

        <p>This is not going to end well. Big pharma is highlighting the risks of their own existing but cheap products that have shown great results against Covid. Big tech is colluding with the government to relentlessly censor people that question the vaccine being "safe and effective", no matter the poster credentials, arguments or sources.</p>
<p>mRNA tech has been known for decades but never used clinically (guess why). And now somehow they found the trick that turns completely risk-free the temporary modification of your genetic code by a vaccine?</p>

        <p>I kind of agree with Kirsch’s number that its likely around 25k in the USA. He doesnt draw on that from Vaers but the CDC’s data of deaths listed at “other” which began to spike right at the beginning of the vax rollout. That would put it up around 4x the current listed VAERS number. But, in reality its really hard to know for sure. If 25-50 deaths was historically the number to stop at - we are well beyond that point for sure and deep into unprecedented territory.</p>

        <p>Here's one. They had only 25 deaths after 40 million inoculations and they halted:</p>

<p>&rt;More than 500 people are thought to have developed Guillain-Barre syndrome after receiving the vaccine; 25 died. No one completely understands the causes of Guillain-Barre, but the condition can develop after a bout with infection or following surgery or vaccination. The federal government paid millions in damages to people or their families.</p>

        <p>Amazing! How do they hide all those deaths? I though only China could do that.</p>
<p>Apparently only 300.000 people have died more than normal, but you are suggesting that 500.000 died from the vaccine alone.</p>

        <p>They just list them as death from 'heart attacks' and 'blood clots' - seizure, whatever the vaccine caused them to die from. It's going to be 1 million times worse when millions who were vaccinated start dropping dead from the spike protein in the vaccine starting in the winter and for the next 2 years - they'll say it's a new 'variant' and new 'strain' because it will have been far too long after they got the shot- too much time will have gone by since they got the shot to be obvious the shot caused them to die. So then their tracks are covered, plausible deniability - they thought all of this through.</p>

        <p>They'll also blame the new 'variants' and new 'strains' on the unvaxxed, claiming that the vaccines only protected the vaxxed from the original strain and the unvaxxed acted as petri dishes for the new strains (when the reality is that the vaccines are driving the evolution of the new variants). The peer pressure and discrimination the unvaxxed are experiencing now is nothing compared to what it will be when the deaths of those millions are blamed on them rather than the vaccines that are truly responsible.</p>
