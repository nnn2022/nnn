    <strong>Existential crisis on self-improvement</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve been trying to ask this question for months, but it’s too uncomfortable for most people to bear, so I’m gonna ask you guys. I’ve been feeling this way for months, despite the fact that I’m doing everything in my power to achieve fulfillment on a daily basis (writing, working out, improving skills, going outside, meditating, etc.).</p>
<p>At this point it’s pretty clear our planet is a feudalistic globalist satan-run society split in two: the elites, &amp; the slaves, with the slaves having no chance of becoming elites &amp; all elites, both present &amp; future, being preordained by those truly at the top. If that’s the case, &amp; I’m a slave now, what’s the point of doing anything if it just keeps the system running? What’s the point of improving yourself, getting extra degrees, etc. just to be a better slave?</p>
<p>I mean, we say one mean word on Twitter &amp; have to go into hiding for the rest of our lives; these elites literally rape children every day &amp; still are praised by the vast majority of society. So what’s the point of it all if I can’t exercise true freedom &amp; power over my life without being exiled/killed? Some esoteric feeling that only I’ll have in my last moment knowing I did my best? I like to think that, but in these times, what truly is wasting your life vs. living it fully? Can you even live fully &amp; find fulfillment with the sheer amount of conditioning throughout society? And if so, how do you do it?</p>
<p>I know that most throughout history who have found themselves in this situation have found fulfillment &amp; some degree of inner peace through believing in a god/combination of gods/other religious dogma that the OG elites put out to pacify their slaves, but that would be just going back to Conditioning 1.0, &amp; I don’t necessarily know if that’s a good idea for me.</p></p>

        <p>You go by letting go of the future and stay in the present.</p>
<p>Going foot by foot.</p>
<p>One day at a time.</p>
<p>Most of the time, right now, you are fine and might be doing something you like. Take the time to enjoy that moment, every minute.</p>
<p>That's all we have.</p>
<p>We are here, alive, but why you ask? Isn't the only thing that matter to be happy and live through emotions that feel good? </p>
<p>Otherwise, what's the point.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter what you do. Not everybody has to be the next Einstein or Elon Musk, or anyone. </p>
<p>As long as you enjoy what you do, you move yourself forward.</p>
<p>I would really love to see the masses wake up and quit playing this sick game... but it seems that the brainwashing is working a tad too well for too many people...</p>
<p>I feel like you deep down, but you asked us how we do it. That's how I try to do it.</p>
<p>I'm not scared of death, because I've learned better and I know it's far from the end. I won't lie, I'd leave anytime if I could, but that's not how life works. I would never suicide myself, simply because it goes against my values and it feels like going against nature.</p>
<p>So yeah, I feel trapped against my will in this hell, but I'm just riding it and trying to find joy and pleasures where I can.</p>
<p>I do the Wim Hoff method and some meditation when I feel like it.</p>
<p>I don't hold any religious believes. I've found that the truth lie between all the stories. You read and listen to all of them, and find yourself the meaning of what is being shared through various perspectives.</p>

        <p>I look for inner peace. I try and be mindful of the present, rather than keeping focus on the bigger picture. The big picture is overwhelming, where as looking out the window at what you see right now and appreciating that, is not.</p>
<p>I heard on a video a while ago that someone was practicing gratitude. They would write down 5 things a day that they were grateful for, but they could never write the same things twice. </p>
<p>It was easy to begin with, family, roof over head, healthy, love, comfort. It gradually got harder and harder, which forced them to look at the smaller things. Such as that they took an umbrella out and stayed dry from the rain. You dont tend to see these things when you're looking at the bigger picture, and it creates an image that things are worse than they maybe are.</p>

        <p>So appreciating the “here &amp; now” basically? And practicing gratitude? Interesting.</p>
<p>I mean, I want bigger in my life (we all do), but I’ve noticed that when I become fully present, things are pretty chill. So what I will do: I will carve out a few 1-2 minute breaks every day, spaced out, where I just reconnect to the present moment &amp; check in with myself so to speak. Thank you. I needed this.</p>

        <p>Improve yourself because you're a god (John 10:34) and that's what gods do. Sure, people will try to take advantage, just like they can of fire - but who ever got close to fire without being enlightened or burned?</p>

        <p>Yo this is a deep conversation.. I would say read the bible inside out and you will understand this elite evil warfare a lot a lot better,, after all these people worship evil Satan.. </p>
<p>but someone else will tell you you yourself are a god and that like you said religion is indoctrination which your not wrong it is.. take these points tho.. Jesus was a Jew and Christianity wasn’t a thing when he was around... but it’s Christians who worship Jesus. Things have spiralled out of control and evil has twisted a lot. </p>
<p>But I can honestly say out of all the things I know weather it, higher powers, consciousness, being whole with the universe and being your own god, egyptian gods, you name it. The only thing that is inline completely with the world and what goes on is that book .. the bible. You just have to really read it. Find the connection with god. Jesus is not god but I personally believe he is out saviour and our only way to god / heaven. The only begotten son.  And If you saw me walking down the road you would probably judge me as the last person to have these believes. But they found me and through all the fucked up shit I know that occurs in this world I find comfort / peace in knowing / believing the devil reign over this world will come to a end and I could possible live enterally with my loved ones that’s all that matters. Fuck this world.. that is honestly my best advice I could give that isn’t bull shit cliche keep your head up type stuff.. P.S I bet this is dreadful format I did try but got carried away my apologies lol.</p>

        <p>He is at one with god yes. The only begotten son of god. The bible does not 100% he is god at all, hence there is a trinity The Father , The Son , The Holy Spirit. He was born yes from Mary / Joseph.. and he was crucified on the cross for our sins. He is at one with god.. the only way to god but he is not god he literally says it.</p>

        <p>Yes, because it was always written.. the almighty the all knowing creator .. I am talking about. Jesus IS and always was going to be our saviour. He is the incarnate son in terms of he is god in human form
But no and he is not the creator. “The son can do nothing by himself he can only do what he sees the father doing because whatever the father does the son does also” John 5:19.  “By myself I can do nothing , I judge only as I hear and my judgement is just for I seek not to please my self but him who has sent me” John 5:30.</p>
