    <p><p><a href="https://thehighwire.com/videos/did-highwire-expose-a-fox-news-hit-piece/">Here is the link:</a> <a href="https://thehighwire.com/videos/did-highwire-expose-a-fox-news-hit-piece/">https://thehighwire.com/videos/did-highwire-expose-a-fox-news-hit-piece/</a></p>

<p>it's actually really funny. All the host talked about is official Pfizer information that the vaccine is not claimed to stop spread. The news reporter has a narrative she is sticking to that it is an "outrage" that his non-profit got relatively smaller PPP funding (everyone was destroyed by lockdowns, so what?) but also holds the pharmaceutical companies to account . She doesn't budge from it and the eventual hit-piece and her being dishonest about her attack dog being in the call shows how sleazy she was being.  </p>
<p>Most incredible thing is her screeching on about "the vaccine is <em>the only way out</em> and you're attacking that and benefiting from loans". First of all, dude doesn't promote 5G theories, literally advocates for holding the companies to account, for example the trials to not be discontinued. Another example he pressured for saline shots to be included in trials and criticises the blank cheque given to pharma companies.  </p>
<p>Lastly, it's incredible everyone is brainwashed that this is <em>the only way</em>.. As we speak India sends out Ivermection. Friends of family live in Nigeria and they used hydroxychloroquine from the start.. Because they don't have the option to self-destruct for months on end, blame the public for not eradicating a virus spread by breathing, absolve themselves of hospital spread/bed occupancy and care home policy and print money and declare a vaccine or bust route. They found other options because <strong>they had to</strong>.  Guess what, Nigeria has a much lower mortality rate than UK or even USA, what's the excuse for that? Whereas in the west, it's political. They don't want to subvert their damaging initial decisions because pharmacological interventions would undermine the whole "this total destruction of months of lockdown was the only option" narrative.  </p>
<p>I wonder what you guys think.</p></p>

        <p>Del Bigtree is the name of the host of Highwire.  He has been speaking out against vaccine injury in the US for years.  He has really put his neck on the line to get the truth out.  I believe his channel is now banned on YouCensor.</p>
<p>If you haven't seen the movie Vaxxed yet, I would highly recommend it.  Vaxxed and Vaxxed II in fact.  Very eye-opening movies.</p>
<p>I didn't watch the whole piece you posted, but I get it.  This reporter was trying for a "gotcha" moment, but in fact stepped into a "gotcha" moment when she realized she didn't know what she was talking about.</p>
<p>There is a general principle occurring here called "appeal to authority".  Most people, in the absence of knowledge, defer to the "experts".  Normally, this would be fine.</p>
<p>However, here's what's happened with covid.  The Media has distorted what the experts have actually said, and have censored others who disagree with the narrative.</p>
<p>It gives the false impression there is a "consensus" about how to deal with the coronavirus.  However, this is simply untrue.</p>
<p><strong>Consider for example the Pfizer claim the vaccine is "95% effective".</strong> </p>
<p>Most people have taken this to mean it prevents 95% of new infections.  This is the way it is presented to the public through the Media.  But this is simply not accurate; and we know this from the scientific data itself.</p>
<p>The study actually claims the vaccine prevents 95% of the <em>symptoms</em> of covid.  This in and of itself is a dubious claim (because what would that mean if you are asymptomatic for example).  But even if we consider the actual claim from the "science", we can see how different it is than what it being presented to the public.</p>
<p>Actual Claim: "The vaccine has a 95% efficiency rate of preventing <em>symptoms</em> brought on by the SARS-COV-2 virus."</p>
<p>Media Spin: "The vaccine is 95% effective." (We're left to believe 95% effective at stopping the spread).</p>
<p>As you can see, these claims are not the same thing.  </p>
<p>The vaccine does not prevent transmission.</p>
<p>That is why you still need to wear a mask and social distance after getting the vaccine.</p>
<p>Now, you might ask: Then what is the point of the vaccine????</p>
<p>Well.  That's a very good question.</p>
