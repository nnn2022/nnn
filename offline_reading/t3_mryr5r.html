        <p>&rt; Then the news broke about 6 women developing similar issues after being vaccinated. And anti-vaxers latched on and started using what’s happened as proof of the dangers of vaccines. My mother’s case may or may not have been related to her vaccine, but she fits with the other cases and is being investigated. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt; My mother was a lifelong believer in science and vaccinations especially. She was a curious, passionate woman who despised the fear mongering of the anti-vaccine movement. She would be rolling over in her grave if she thought her death might contribute to bad faith medical quackery. </p>
<p>I was going to have lunch... and I've just lost my appetite. How can people be so stupid??? I don't think that Jonestown was this bad.</p>

        <p>&rt;So here is a message from her daughter: get vaccinated. If the  J&amp;J vaccine is deemed safe for you, take that. Vaccination saves far more lives than it claims and we have a social obligation to take that tiny tiny risk for ourselves for the sake of our global well being. </p>
<p>The world is becoming weirder and weirder!</p>
<p>&rt;we have a social obligation to take that tiny tiny risk for ourselves</p>
<p>What?! Social obligation?! I don't remember signing a contract with society to take unapproved medical treatments. Secondly, is this kind daughter going to compensate us if we suffer any form of adverse reaction, to up and including death?</p>
<p>Look, I am sorry her mother died, BUT it is obvious her mother AND the daughter did not read the fine print, it is an experimental medical treatment, these pharmacy companies are not liable for anything that happens. </p>
<p>That fact in itself should tell you all you need to know about these "vaccines" and whether you should take them. You take these "vaccines" at your own risk and own peril. There's a reason why you do not play Russian Roulette with a live round in the chamber, why do so with these unapproved vaccines? Oh, right, I forgot, you have a "social obligation" to take that risk!</p>
