&rt;Speaking during an interview on the Onda Cero network, the minister stated: “Everything appears to point to the fact that we will have to administer a third dose. Via the [European Union], we have signed up to a contract with Pfizer and Moderna. What needs to be determined is when [the shot will be administered],” she continued.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;...<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Darias went even further when asked whether residents of Spain would have to be vaccinated against Covid-19 every year. “Yes, without a doubt,” she replied, before insisting that the current objective is to “continue vaccinating everyone until reaching 100% [of the population], if that is possible.”<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The need for a third dose of a Covid-19 vaccine has not, however, been backed by scientific research. For now, the line of the regulatory agencies – the European Medicines Agency and the Food and Drug Administration in the United States – is that all of the vaccines being used in Spain – Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Janssen and Oxford-AstraZeneca – offer protection against all of the known variants of the coronavirus. This is also backed by studies published until now.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;...<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The European Commission closed a deal in May with Pfizer-BioNTech to purchase 900 million doses of their vaccine, along with an option for another 900 million, should a booster shot be necessary.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Among the scientific community, the practically unanimous position right now is that a third shot is not necessary, and that it is still yet to be seen whether SARS-CoV-2 ends up being a seasonal virus – something that could mean a yearly shot is needed. It is also true that the slow pace of vaccination on a global scale – with dozens of countries where not even the most-vulnerable groups have been immunized – increases the chances that the virus continues to mutate, making the current vaccines less effective.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;This scenario – which is more or less probable, according to the source – could make a third shot necessary. That said, given it would be to combat a different virus, it might be more appropriate to class this as a new or adapted vaccine, like the ones used each year against the flu.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Surprisingly balanced - actually somewhat critical of the Minister - that is ruined by the "<strong><em>It is also true that the slow pace of vaccination on a global scale – with dozens of countries where not even the most-vulnerable groups have been immunized – increases the chances that the virus continues to mutate, making the current vaccines less effective</em></strong>" canard.</p>
