    <strong>Dr. Fearlove : or How I Learned to Start Worrying and Love Hypochondriac Psychosomatic Neuroses</strong>
    <p><p>Nature (!!!) has recently published an accelerated article (I mean if we can accelerate the 10-20 year vaccine approval process to 3 months, why not accelerate research from the eXpErTz!?) which claims that <strong><em>patients with COVID-19 who survived hospitalization had a 51% higher risk of dying compared with 13,997 influenza patients who also had been hospitalized</em></strong> and that <strong><em>survivors had a 59% increased risk of dying within six months after contracting the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</em></strong></p>
<p>What are these sequalae, if I may ask?</p>
<p>Well, the usual ones such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Respiratory conditions</li>
<li>CNS and neurocognitive disorders</li>
<li>Mental health burden - anxiety, fear-related disorders, sleep-awake disorders, PTSD, etc</li>
<li>Metabolic diseases - obesity, diabetes, lipid metabolism disorders, etc</li>
<li>Poor general wellbeing - malaise, fatigue, muscle disorders, muscoskeletal pain, anaemia, etc</li>
<li>Cardiovascular conditions - hypertension, angina, cardiac dysrhythmias, heart failure, etc</li>
<li>GI tract diseases - oesophageal disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, dysphagia, abdominal pain, constipation, etc</li>
</ol>
<p>I know that I recently renamed the DeAdLy PaNdEmIc to "Swiss Army Kovid" as there's no symptom that it cannot cause, but this latest paper from Nature is just the straw that broke the camel's back. <strong>I mean if people can DIE with "long-haul" symptoms like constipation, anxiety, PTSD, stress and anxiety within 6 months of a C19+ PCR test, then C19 is truly a dangerous disease!!!</strong></p>
<p>For the past year, we - including our co-conspirators at the CDC - have been screaming that C19 affects those with many comorbidities and that all the mUh DeAtHs were of those who were going to die that year anyway as C19 was simply accelerating the inevitable like the annual influenza (Oh, there's still an APB out on that slimy bugger.)</p>
<p>Due to the utter vitiation of post-2020 science, the ScIeNtIsTz behind the article have used their well-funded adroitness in deception to attribute these well-documented comorbidities and MSM hysteria-induced hypochondriac psychoneuroses to mUh LoNg HaUl CoViD SyNdRoMe.</p>
<p>I just wasted my lunch break reading this tripe, but if anyone wants to develop PTSD, feel free to find the article here:</p>

<p>Remember to "Believe the science," "Trust the experts" and to live in unbridled fear!</p></p>
