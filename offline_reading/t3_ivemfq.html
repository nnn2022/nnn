    <strong>What can I do anymore?</strong>
    <p><p>The U.K. is about to go into a second lockdown. We did this. We came together as a nation. We eradicated the disease and nobody is listening. </p>
<p>For the first time in three years, I am making a plan to commit suicide. I don’t know what else to do. I’ve seen everything trickle away, and now I’m not sure what I’ll have the opportunity to do anymore. I’ve got a job interview on Tuesday but it’s in a care home. If I’m walking around trying to talk to old people who are even more scared than me, making beds dressed in more PPE than the Chernobyl clear up team for a disease everyone in there already has immunity to, I don’t know how I’m going to live with myself.</p>
<p>My country has been couped from the inside and nobody is listening. Nobody is listening. I want to believe everybody agrees, believe that it’s just a few Chinese bot accounts, but no. Most people want this. And I can’t fight. And I don’t have anyone anymore. My family are in this fucking death cult and I hate how I can’t talk to them about it.</p>
<p>I’m sorry. I want to be in a group with likeminded outside of Buckingham Palace, break the gates and  not to engaging police as we sit in the palace grounds playing Van Morrison and singing Heat of the Moment. I feel like we were progressing to this moment. I want to save the world. I don’t know what I can do.</p></p>

        <p>Maybe you'd feel less suicidal if you took the pressure off yourself to save the world. Just take one day at a time, look for everyday opportunities to do what's right or to make one person's day better. You can do that in a care home. I bet most of the caretakers treat the elderly residents like biological threats. Since you don't have that fear, you could make their day a little better. And maybe you could save up your earnings to move to Bermuda. They've been very welcoming of people.</p>

        <p>Do not kill yourself. Turn off the TV and stay away from social media a day or two. Realize that is not what life is about. You can’t change the whole world, but you can change your world. Stay strong</p>
