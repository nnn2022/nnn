    <p><p>We probably wouldn’t need an experimental vaccine. We’d have experimental treatments, which would have a much more clear picture on benefits vs risks.</p></p>

        <p>The anti bodies plasma infusion is highly effect. The guy that handles my rent is 73 and had open heart surgery recently after a heart attack, well he was diagnosed with covid, they did the antibody plasma treatment before he got sick and he never even got sick. Said he was fine.  Said they almost killed him by putting too much blood in him though. The only issue is this treatment only works among unvaxxinated. Both the donar and recipient cannot be vaxxed. We have effective treatment i don't understand why we need a experimental "vaccine" if you can even call it that. Question I'm wondering is if you catch SARS COV2 and do get sick can you even be considered as having covid 19?? Don't diseases have to harm you for you to be diagnosed with the disease? Never understood that</p>

Hydroxycholraquine &amp; Zinc<br>
<strong>HCQmeta.com</strong><br>
This regularly updated material shows there have been positive results for 191 studies involving 270,418 patients.   </p>
<p>The results for the use of Hydroxychloroquine which included 245 trials involving 3,919 scientists and almost 375,000 patients demonstrated the following<br>
Ivermectin<br>
64% improvement in 26 early treatment trials<br>
72% improvement in early treatment mortality results<br>
46% improvement in 6 early treatment RCT results<br>
22% improvement in 166 late treatment trials<br>
24% improvement in 35 randomized controlled trials<br>
In a series of 56 trials that included 469 scientists, over 18,000 patients and 28 randomized controlled trials, the following was discovered (https://c19ivermectin.com/ ):<br>
85% improvement in 14 prophylaxistrials<br>
78% improvement in 23 early treatmenttrials<br>
46% improvement in 19 late treatmenttrials<br>
74% improvement in 20 mortality results<br>
65% improvement in 28 randomizedcontrolled trials  </p>
<p>In Mexico City, doctors and scientists have been conducting a study throughout 2020 in the use ofIvermectin. <br>
 The study included over 200,000 people and found the range of positive effect totaled 52% to 76% depending on model specification. The team concluded that ivermectin-based<br>
interventions in a well-designed population-level scheme mitigates<br>
the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health system in the<br>
world’s fifth largest city.  The study was led by professionals in<br>
a number of agencies, including Mexico City Digital Agency for Public<br>
Innovation, the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS), and<br>
Ministry of Health Mexico City.  The graph below demonstrates the<br>
downturn in hospitalizations and deaths very quickly after the<br>
administration of Ivermectin as a prophylactic. <br>

Some other compelling facts about Ivermectin:<br>
Ivermectin has been determined to be remarkably effective in prophylaxis (\~86% fewer cases) and treatment (-68% fewer deaths) for COVID-19 prophylaxis by the British<br>
Ivermectin Recommendation Development panel;<br>
<a href="https://hospitalpharmacyeurope.com/views/ivermectin-time-for-action/">https://hospitalpharmacyeurope.com/views/ivermectin-time-for-action/</a></p>
<p>Ivermectin has proven to be very safe,<br>
as one-third of the world’s population (\~7,850,000,000) has taken<br>
ivermectin as part of mass community treatment to prevent many<br>
different parasite (worm) infections and where only 16 deaths and<br>
4673 adverse events have been reported through World Health<br>
Organization and Uppsala University VigiAccess database for<br>
pharmacovigilance from 1992 to 2021;<br>
Several countries, including Japan,<br>
Slovakia, Bulgaria, India, Egypt, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Bolivia,<br>
Peru, Argentina, have made ivermectin readily available to their<br>
citizens (often over-the-counter purchase or free);<br>
Ivermectin is already approved in<br>
Canada for anti-parasitic use and is now generic and inexpensive;<br>
Cell culture experiments show that<br>
ivermectin has robust antiviral action against a pool of viruses<br>
including HIV-1, dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus, West Nile virus,<br>
Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Chikungunya virus, Pseudorabies<br>
virus, adenovirus, and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).<br>
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32533071/Ivermectin<br>
inhibits the replication of many viruses including SARS-CoV2;<br>
inhibits SARS-CoV2 binding to host tissue; has potent<br>
anti-inflammatory properties; diminishes viral load and protects<br>
against organ damage; prevents transmission and development of<br>
Covid-19 in people exposed to infected patients (prophylaxis);<br>
hastens recovery and prevents deterioration in mild to moderate<br>
disease; hastens recovery, and decreases both ICU admissions and<br>
death in hospitalized patients; reduces mortality in critically ill<br>
patients; and dramatically reduces case-fatality rates in regions<br>
with wide spread use.<br>

        <p>Thanks for the info!!! I guess a better clarification would be that we’d spend the time and money to explore the efficacy of the treatments further. Basically less money pushing vaccines = more money toward treatments (a better option IMHO).</p>

        <p>The benefits and risk is pretty clear on what we have now, but the problem is the money is being spent towards propaganda instead of telling people about the risks and benefits.</p>
