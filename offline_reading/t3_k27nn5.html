    <strong>Reality Vs. the internet</strong>
    <p><p>I typically go out for a walk everyday. And it just feel so good to see kids playing, people grouped together, and today there were a group of 20 playing a pickle-ball tournament (all without masks).  Actually, the majority of people that were walking weren't wearing masks.  And people stopped and chatted with me, it just proves that there is such a disconnect here on social media and what the media tries to paint the big picture as.   </p>
<p>I'd love to hear some of your stories; more instances of people that haven't been turned into agoraphobics by the media.</p></p>

        <p>Same here.  It’s such a breath of fresh air just seeing kids playing together at a park without masks on.  Some parents get it.  Others not so much - I’ve seen newborns with masks on at the grocery stores.   I think it depends on the level of “news” they watch.  I watched about 15 minutes of cnn the other day and it was insane.  No wonder the people watching this stuff for hours are so scared of everything.</p>

        <p>As a delivery driver in eastern Washington, about a quarter of the people I deliver to will come to the door with a mask. I've had a few people ask me to place their item on the ground. Doesn't bother me at all. Single use masks for delivering to old folks homes and hospitals. New mask for each location. I don't wear a cloth mask daily due to bacterial complications. The majority of people do not appear to care.</p>

        <p>I’m staying at my parent’s house about an hour outside Seattle for a few days. Yesterday I went to the local high school track to run for a bit and there were flag football and soccer games taking place on the field. There had to be at least 50 people and no one was wearing a mask. It was great</p>

        <p>I'm in the People's Republic of California. I can't even enjoy a maskless walk outdoors without seeing mask people everywhere. Every day I see people riding a bike with a mask on, jogging/walking alone with a mask on, or people driving alone with a mask on. It makes me lose faith in humanity more and more by the day, but I am starting to learn to laugh at it all.</p>

        <p>Newcastle here! We have a brewery that's selling beer in milk bottles, loads of people take that (or whatever their tipple is) down to the quayside on weekends or in the evening and just sit and chat with friends, like ordinary human beings. I'm excited to go myself tomorrow. On the weekends the town centre, parks and quayside are packed with people just going out for a walk or meeting with friends, everyone is being sensible, which shows that these restrictions are redundant. Tbh the amount of people out and about just enjoying the outdoors, even in a town or city centre, even in the late autumn, is the one thing that I hope stays after all of this.</p>

        <p>Oh same! It's weird that just the smallest interactions feel so important. Like when someone came up to me and asked me for directions. Or when the path was all flooded and I laughed with a lady about how we couldn't get across it. Seeing kids play, asking people what they're doing at the weekend and them saying they're meeting friends (which they're not afraid to tell me because they see me breaching the mask mandate all day everyday). Chatting with other dog walkers (maskless, may I add), or when they held a football match - spectators and all - in the field where I walk my dog. I guess they just feel so human! Honestly most people think the restrictions are silly, it's only people who have nothing better to do than screech about stuff they don't even have to deal with from their basement watching netflix who represent the Internet as a bunch of doomers.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately in NJ, the amount of masks on the paths in my local park that I go to most days has significantly increased in the last few weeks. For a long time it was maybe a third masked, now it’s less than half on a good day, two thirds if a bad day.  Although I will say a lot of them are people that don’t wear them unless they’re about to pass a person...which is almost worse bc even experts have said walking or running by someone outside has an extremely low chance of passing the virus.</p>
