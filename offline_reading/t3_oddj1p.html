    <strong>Call to Ban Subs That Promote Hate, Violence, Disinformation, and Extremism - r/NoNewNoralBan</strong>
    <p><p>Reddit Admins,</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I would like to make a formal complaint regarding a sub called r/NoNewNormalBan. While I fully support freedom of speech and do not promote censorship, this subs sole purpose is to bash aother sub, r/NoNewNormal. I draw the line at hate speech, racism, projection, and false narratives. I've known about this sub for a while now, but didn't pay it much mind until recently. But I feel given todays political environment, I cant help but consider this sub to be a radical hate community. I took  a quick look though the posts just now and copied some examples that I could quickly find.   </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I have been apart of r/NoNewNormal for a few months now, and have enjoyed the experience there. As with all subs, we do get some not so popular opinions, and the mods and other community Redditors are typically quick to police. The Mod has done a great job at keeping communication safe and clean. in my experience, this community has been pro-choice and welcoming others for discussion, yet we're constantly branded as otherwise. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>An Unhealthy Obsession</strong> – r/NoNewNormalBan has an unhealthy obsession with r/NoNewNormal. This is a sub that exists simply to trash and tarnish the view point of other reddit users.</p>
<p><strong>Hate Speech / Misinformation / Disinformation -</strong> I just scrolled through for a few min. This sub, &rt;r/NoNewNormalBan has an obsession with projecting the ideologies of hate and racism. </p>
<p>\&rt;r/NoNewNormalBan/comments/mtmx9j/why_doesnt_reddit_ban_nnn_antimaskers_constantly/</p>
<p>\&rt;r/NoNewNormalBan/comments/n1n4r0/as_a_fellow_canadian_i_will_be_happy_to_see_them/</p>
<p>\&rt;u/BitchinBiologist - There's a few countries that tried to test the NNN method: Brazil and India...I must say it isn't really working.</p>
<p>\&rt;u/Kvascha - True, I hate the american covidiots the most…</p>
<p>\&rt;r/NoNewNormalBan/comments/nrncb6/fauci_needs_fulltime_security_because_of_all_the/</p>
<p>\&rt;u/GuyPeakA - Great, they turned from hateful Luddites to straight up murderous lynchers. I can’t wait for the feds to check out their subreddit.</p>
<p>\&rt;u/xMasterMelonx - They were always murderous.</p>
<p>\&rt;r/NoNewNormalBan/comments/n067wq/ironically_the_sheeple_are_the_covid_deniers_who/</p>
<p>\&rt;u/CookieFar4331 - Absolutely. In my mind, they are murderers.</p>
<p>\&rt;u/Ladicius_- I just think that, whilst NoNewNormal is very extreme on their side and promote misinformation and bigotry, we shouldn't go down the same path as them. We need to keep collecting things about them that breaks the Reddit Content policy but also be here as a voice of reason. Calling them murderers is in my opinion a bit far fetched.</p>
<p>\&rt;r/NoNewNormalBan/comments/nlr7j1/they_are_mad_asymptomatic_cases_arent_being/</p>
<p>Whole thread is calling r/NoNewNormal murderers.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>\&rt;r/NoNewNormalBan/comments/mw2vgf/casual_plots_to_kill_a_guy_who_is_doing_his_job/</p>
<p>\&rt;u/Soren_Kagawa - Yeah that whole thread needs to reported to the admins, they’re openly advocating for the murder of a public official. </p>
<p>\&rt;r/NoNewNormalBan/comments/o76suw/more_racist_dog_whistles_from_them_comparing/</p>
<p>\&rt;u/UnknownEntity00000 - "Wait, don't you know the narrative? White man bad, statistics are racist, not getting jabbed makes you a biggot, etc.”</p>
<p>\&rt;NNN has stopped trying to hide that they're racists</p>
<p>\&rt;r/NoNewNormalBan/comments/n5kikw/racist_fucks/</p>
<p>\&rt;u/deadPanSoup - Ah yes, the ancient Indian art of infecting and killing thousands with a deadly virus. Racist fucks.</p>
