<p>I wasn't raised a Christian - my family are atheists - but I converted in my late twenties.  The more I looked for truth and beauty in the world, the more I realised that all those paths led to God.  I'm glad I made the change.</p>

        <p>I was raised Catholic and while I do not "practice" the religion and I fully recognize the corruption of the church, I do think there was a lot of truth in it.. A song from church that has been playing in my head lately is called "Be not Afraid" and it's literally directly applicable to my experience with COVID... one of the lines that stood out to me when I was recalling the lyrics was:</p>
<p>"And if wicked men insult and hate you, all because of me, Blessed, Blessed are you!"</p>
<p>As someone who believes God = Truth, this line in particular hits home because of how nasty people are when you state facts, nowadays.</p>

        <p>I like that you are simultaneously being snarky, AND missing the very fact that Yes, this actually was the plan laid out in the early part of genesis, and that most of the book is about people resisting Gods plan to forgive all of us... So yeah, that's exactly the plan... What sacrifice could ever pay for a crime against the one true God? Would have to be something equal to him... But nothing else is, and so, he became flesh, and sacrificed himself to himself, to forgive all sin against him for all time...</p>

        <p>Only as long as you pretend the very clear messages of:</p>
<p>"Human sacrifice is an abomination to God"</p>
<p>And,</p>
<p>"Do not murder"</p>
<p>Don't exist.</p>
<p>Are there other words and phrases that <em>are</em> there that you also pretend are not there?</p>
<p>How about the dozens of times God says "these are the laws until the end of days".  Isn't that be inconvenient!  Better pretend those don't exist!</p>
<p>Not to mention the shear fucking hubris of believing that humans murdered God, besides how absolutely degranged genuinely proposing that as reality sounds.</p>
<p>And your whole basis of your mythology is only visible in secret messages that you can only see if you squint your eyes, tilt your head, look sideways, and turn your brain off to see them.</p>
<p>WHILE ignoring "human sacrifice is an abomination to God" AND "Do not murder".</p>
<p>The whole type of deception perpetrated by christianity for ~2000 years is effectively the same type of deception practice by the healthcare sector and their affiliates and all of their stakeholders for the last 15+ months especially, although in various degrees for the last 40+ years.</p>
<p>Namely, especially:  calling things what they are not, and also pretending that crucial relevant pre-existing matters do not exist.</p>
<p>Your rebellion against God will end.</p>

        <p>Wow, somehow you took something I said completely the wrong way. I'm not going to pretend ANYTHING in the bible isn't there, so lets just say that right up front....</p>
<p>Murder? Yep, that one is far enough up the list that it made it all the way to the 10 Commandments.... written in stone as it were.... so yes, we have established that murder is a sin.... glad we agree on that.</p>
<p>"human sacrifice is an abomination" again, I'd concur.... specifically in the Abraham story, you'll note that he was stopped by God, told not to harm the boy, and God provided the ram. You did note this as a beautiful parallelism in the text, a note toward God also providing Jesus, but I'll ask if you also noticed the connection between Gen 3:15 and Jesus, that he was born of a woman, and the way things play out in Rev? Good stuff..... BUT wait... so then is the crucifixion also abomination? nope. If you'll permit, I'll offer this link to not have to retype the whole internet <a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/human-sacrifice.html">https://www.gotquestions.org/human-sacrifice.html</a></p>
<p>Now, I don't know what you think my rebellion against God is... never minding the fact that I, like everyone else, has sinned (not that its a contest, but oh man have I....) I know that Jesus Christ completed promise made in Isaiah 53. I'm not squinting my eyes at anything, and the message isn't secret, it's laid out in black and white (and occasionally some red letters). Far from ignoring anything pre-existent, I'm calling you back to Genesis when God said how he was going to make it right. I'll take you slightly further back than that and point to the thing that pre-existed everything else... "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."</p>

        <p>How does that actually make any sense to you? God creates a man to name tens of thousands of animals he randomly created, decided to give the man a "help meet" called woman, puts two magic trees in the center of the garden, a walking, talking snake in the midst, then decides to come down from heaven to walk around in the cool of the day and spy on his new creations, flips out because they didn't want to exist in his idyllic garden of innocence forever, and so banishes them from the garden with fire swords and cherubim, only to kill them and their inbred offspring off in a genocide the world over, sparing only one family and one of each animal on a massive boat at least 30,000 feet above ground, I mean need I go on? That's Genesis for you, a mindnumbing book of judgmental fairytales.</p>

        <p>I've read Genesis, the Psalms, Proverbs, the books of the minor prophets (Micah, Habakkuk, etc.), Ruth, Job, Ecclesiastes, and various parts of the other books of the Old Testament, along with all the New Testament. And in reading them I encountered so many paradoxes and obvious falsehoods but wanted to believe and so dismissed them. Despite my total disinterest in it all, I've still got a few Psalms memorized.</p>
<p>I went to church from the time I was born. Fundamental Baptist Church, check. Lutheran, check. Methodist, check. I've read Genesis well enough to know that that is, indeed, what happens. And it makes no sense whatsoever. The entire Bible is nothing but juxtapositions between the righteous and sinners, and the respective joy of a holy life and consequence of a sinful life. "The LORD knoweth the way of the righteous, but the way of the ungodly shall perish." And perish they do, genocide after genocide, all with God's stamp of approval.</p>
<p>All the great men (they're pretty much all men) of the Bible were killers or were threatening people that God would kill them/starve them/put them into slavery. Then Jesus comes along, not to abolish the law but to fulfill it, gets hammered up to a cross and that's somehow construed as undeniable proof that He's the son of God? If Jesus even existed, and there's decent enough evidence to support that he, in some average human form did, then he would be one of hundreds of such "prophets" of the day, one that just happened to take off.</p>

        <p>How is it possible that you read all of that and so completely missed the actual point of any of it... And no, that is not what happened, and if you read it, you know your account of genesis play sloppy with the actual story. But let's set all that aside and go back to genesis for a minute here... The first people break the only rule they had, and God tells there right there how he is going to fix it. The entire Messiah thing gets laid out right there in the garden, including how Revelation goes down... Then you have a whole rest of the bible full of people resisting Gods plan to forgive them... They keep thinking they know better, and they keep proving they don't. </p>
<p>And as for you thinking it's all juxtaposition between the righteous and the sinners, go check that part again where it says ALL have sinned and fall short, and tell me who was righteous? (And since you used righteous as opposite of a sinner, we can go with that, but that's not actually what it even means)</p>

        <p>Look at you with that signature tone of arrogance of a "true believer", and I'm supposed to be your stereotypical "unbeliever", a wicked sinner at the hands of an angry God. I don't like your tone and I don't give a fuck what you think you know about me. There is no "if." I read that shit you call the Word of God every day, for years. Not sure if you noticed, but my account of the Bible isn't supposed to be word for word. It's a brief, sweeping overview, non-chronologically emphasizing the idiocy of believing in such things as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a talking snake </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a curse placed on all women</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>people living 800 years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>giants roaming the earth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abraham willing to kill his son (great Biblical parallel, you need not remind me. Heard a three part sermon on that one before.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abraham knocking up his daughters in a drunken slumber</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pulling out the old KJV for the first time in years has only strengthened my belief that, if God would have actually existed, he'd be the most sick, demented being to ever live, and that Christians are still the most judgmental, illogical people clinging to old time religion in lieu of science.</p>

        <p>I understand that the actual tone of voice doesn't come through on the internet and its just flat text on a screen, but that wasn't my tone, if there even was a tone.  I don't draw any type of dichotomous line between you and I like you suggest. I'm a sinner, same as anyone else, and I don't think God is angry at you for it.</p>
<p>I stand by my comments on your earlier comment on the facts of the bible, but, that aside, lets look at some of the things you say here, since you roped it in to very close to correct.</p>
<p>-talking snake - Yes. Also don't forget a talking donkey in another part of the bible. </p>
<p>-a curse on women - Yes, pain in childbirth, and also in the very same spot the promise that HER line would produce the messiah, and that he would defeat death in Revelation.</p>
<p>-people living 800 years - Methuselah was 969 and Jared was 962. </p>
<p>-Giants - From the Hebrew word Nephilim, which just means 'fallen ones', but often translated loosely as giant, and there are some actual descriptions of guys like Goliath being 9ish feet tall. If you'll allow me to offer a link I partially disagree with, I think their take on Stonehenge is wrong and out of place, but <a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/giants-in-the-Bible.html">https://www.gotquestions.org/giants-in-the-Bible.html</a></p>
<p>-Abraham and his son - yes, he was totally willing to do it, holding nothing back from God. God stopped him, clarified that he was not to harm the boy, and provided the ram. You are right about the parallels to Jesus, and I'm sure the 3 part you heard on that was probably very similar to several other examples one could find on youtube, as it is a very popular sermon type. Did you also get one on the connection between gen 3:15 and Jesus as a description of both his birth from Mary, AND the events of Revelation?</p>
<p>-guy knocks up his daughters - I think you are refereeing to Lot, but I'll look past the name swap, it's a very big book, lots of characters, and so many stories... anyway.... yes, that event is recorded there in Genesis 19. Add it to the giant list of bad ideas that people had that were not prescribed actions. does inbreeding exist? yes, even still. Are there biblical instructions not to get blind drunk? yes. was if Abrahams idea? no. Was he aware of it? no, but again, I'll grant he bears responsibility for being blind drunk, even if he was mourning the loss of his wife.</p>
<p>I do think you've set up a false dichotomy between Christianity and science. I have a Masters of Science degree, and treasure logic as a tool for seeking truth. In fact, can I offer you a book about science? Its called 'To Adam, about Adam'. If you want to put it on an amazon wish list and send me the link, I'll gift it to you. Basically, a very science scientist wrote it to explain to his son Adam (spoiler was already in the title) that the more he studies deep science, the more it supports his belief. The main cornerstone is him laying out the science of why he believes the creation story did happen, but that science shows it must happen in the sequence described for the ecosystems to function. Switch 2 of the days, and it all falls apart, because science.</p>

        <p>It's anything but inevitable. Every day, millions of non-believers die. What about me? I could be the grocery clerk, postal worker, or waiter you see every day. Despite our disagreement here, would you honestly like to see me fried to a crisp for millions of years, weeping and gnashing my teeth, desperate for it to stop but to no avail, while you're chilling out in heaven?</p>

        <p>If I can interject... I don't think claiming belief is important. I think that doing the right thing matters more than claiming to be a Christian. I know a lot of people who go to church every week and act like complete shit the other 99.5% of their lives. Pretty sure character matters a lot more than some arbitrary label of "I'm a Christian" "Jesus is the way" blah blah blah. People in this sub, generally speaking, are fighting a righteous cause. You will know a man by his works. God doesn't care if you know his name.</p>

        <p>I think they go hand in hand, one cannot be done without the other and expect all to be well. I agree that character matters and it is the goodness of character which can be built up and maintained through believing, having faith and doing good things.</p>
<p>We can't exactly say we know what God cares or thinks, but we do know that God knows our hearts. So if in our hearts and souls we do good, we ask for forgiveness and truly mean it, then we will be alright.</p>

        <p>I think you are missing a key element here... If God is truly fair, then yes, that is what we deserve. Good news though, he's not fair, he's gracious, and has offered complete forgiveness to anyone that wants it.</p>
