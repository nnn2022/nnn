        <p>Look sweaty, the shot works in some ways and not other ways, fact is it doesn't work but will work so long as we all get vaccinated, but if we continue to go about our day to day lives after getting vaccinated it will no longer work.</p>
<p>We need 101% vaccination, then another year of staying at home and #WEARAMASK, after which case it still won't work and you can get another shot, but to be safe just continue to stay home and mask up.</p>
<p>What is so difficult for y'a'l'l to comprehend?</p>

        <p>But whether I take the vaccine or not doesn't change the scamdemic. It will continue, unabated, until world domination is complete.</p>
<p>So, back to the original question, why do I need one?</p>
<p>The answer is, I don't. If you took it and it works, you are safe and have nothing to fear. There's no need for me to participate in the clinical trial of an untested vaccine and untested delivery system (mRNA), other than to be in the "control group".</p>

        <p>“No vaccine is 100% effective” is not an excuse to be an authoritarian piece of shit and ask the government to take people’s rights away because you’re afraid of disease. </p>
<p>Do not support the government gun holding people hostage and forcing them to vaccinate to a certain population percentage. </p>

        <p>Natural herd immunity also protects people who cannot get vaccines.  </p>
<p>Personally, I have an autoimmune disease and won't be taking it unless there are actual studies done on the long-term effects of the mRNA vaccines on people like me.  I also don't expect everyone <em>else</em> take it, because I am comfortable with the risk of living my life normally.</p>

        <p>Vaccines are ONE WAY to partially achieve herd immunity. For thousands of years we achieved herd immunity the old fashioned way, by people getting the disease.</p>
<p>According to the CDC, the vaccine doesn't prevent you from getting the disease, nor from spreading the disease. But hey, what do they know, right?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/keythingstoknow.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/keythingstoknow.html</a></p>
<p>&rt;Although COVID-19 vaccines are effective at keeping you from getting sick, scientists are still learning how well vaccines prevent you from spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 to others, even if you do not have symptoms. Early data show the vaccines do help keep people with no symptoms from spreading COVID-19, but we are learning more as more people get vaccinated.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;We’re also still learning how long COVID-19 vaccines protect people.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;For these reasons, people who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 should keep taking precautions in public places, until we know more, like wearing a mask, staying 6 feet apart from others, avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated spaces, and washing your hands often.</p>
<p>If you can still "spread the virus to others even if you do not have symptoms" that says you HAVE the disease (you can't spread something you don't have).</p>
<p>If you don't have it, then you can't spread it. Yet, those who are fully vaccinated "should keep taking precautions in public places" because ... you can still get it and still spread it.</p>

<p>They have very clearly stated that the vaccine is mostly about you not getting sick (as in not showing symptoms, being hospitalized, etc.), not about keeping you from getting COVID. It's to lessen the symptoms, not prevent transmission.</p>

        <p>Assume for the sake of argument that is true. Then why in the world would a "fully vaxed" person (defined, by them, as someone who is 2 weeks past the last shot) need to continue to wear two or three masks, social distance, avoid indoor spaces, etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. ?????</p>
<p>WHY?  Why on EARTH would you need to do that? What possible reason would there be OTHER THAN GETTING THE DISEASE!?!?!????</p>
<p>There is no other logical explanation. And they admit to this in the other paragraphs where they clearly say you can get the disease after getting the vax because it doesn't prevent transmission, just lessons symptoms.</p>

        <p>In addition the CDC is moving to cover up "breakthrough" infections (the massive number of vaccinated people who are getting infected) as much as possible. They've made two significant changes.</p>
<p>First, they aren't reporting any infections that don't result in hospitalization or death. If we did the same for COVID, the "casedemic" numbers would be drastically lower.</p>
<p>Second they are lowering the cycle threshold, only for vaccinated people, from 40+ to 28. If they did this for all tests COVID would immediately cease to be a pandemic. It would never have been considered a pandemic if we'd started with reasonable PCR cycle thresholds.</p>

<p>They are trying to keep the numbers hidden by changing the rules of what constitutes a breakthrough case because there are so many at this point. Hence only reporting hospitalization &amp; death, and only testing for CT &lt;= 28.</p>

        <p>First off, according to the CDC, the vaccine doesn't prevent you from getting COVID so your entire first paragraph is out the window. They can't rely on people around them to not get infected.</p>
<p>People who have severe reactions to vaccines should be the first test subjects. These vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) are a whole new class of untested delivery systems, mRNA. Maybe they aren't allergic to them.</p>
<p>Those with compromised immune systems or reduced effectiveness, for whatever reasons, are the ones who should be taking precautions. Unfortunately, we told EVERYONE to wear masks and so on. That means those who actually need N95 respirators and other actual PPE (BTW, a "surgical mask" doesn't qualify as PPE) can't get it. So we are making it WORSE, not better for this group.</p>
<p>Besides which, as I said at the start, the CDC specifically says the vaccines don't prevent you from getting COVID nor from spreading it. So, again, useless for the immunocompromised or those with reduced effectiveness to be around people who THINK they are safe, but actually aren't.</p>

        <p>If the vaccine shot works, then a fully vaccinated population will stop the spread of the virus. It will be effectively extinguished. This is why no one you know has died of smallpox, which once ravaged whole populations. Enough people were vaccinated (or died) that the population achieved herd immunity.   </p>
<p>If the vaccine shot works, and only part of the population takes the vaccine, then the virus continues to spread, just more slowly. The more the virus spreads, the more chances there are for it to produce mutations that can defeat the vaccine, and more potential for a second outbreak. This is why the flu persists, despite flu vaccines. (The influenza virus also has more genetic material prone to mutation, allowing it to mutate much more easily)  </p>
<p>The known health risks of getting vaccinated are the tiniest fraction of the known risks associated with contracting covid. The shot is free. You are free to choose to take it or not. But your choice ultimately impacts the results of my choice.</p>

        <p>I hate to break it to you Moron, but none of the injections STOP transmission of SARS-COV2.  This has been admitted to by the CEO of Moderna.  The injections only reduce symptoms of COVID for some people.  That is why so many people that have received their injections, still get COVID and can still pass it on.</p>
<p>Plus, studies have shown that a huge percentage of people are already immune to COVID because of their exposures to other coronaviruses, such as the common cold.  Like 40% of the population.  Of course, you don't know that do you?  That is why such a huge percentage of people either have very minor symptoms or don't even know that they have had COVID.</p>

        <p>You should maybe do a bit of research before you spout off non-scientific garbage. Even the CDC admits that the vaccine does NOT stop you from GETTING OR SPREADING COVID! It simply reduces the symptoms, supposedly, to approximately the same level as those who haven't been vaccinated experience (meaning you don't even know you have COVID).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;What we are still learning<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Scientists are still learning <strong>how well vaccines prevent you from spreading the virus.</strong> We’re also still learning <strong>how long COVID-19 vaccines protect people.</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong><em>Although COVID-19 vaccines are effective at keeping you from getting sick, scientists are still learning how well vaccines prevent you from spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 to others, even if you do not have symptoms.</em></strong> Early data show the vaccines do help keep people with no symptoms from spreading COVID-19, but we are learning more as more people get vaccinated.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/keythingstoknow.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/keythingstoknow.html</a></p>
<p>As to the health risks of getting the vaccine, I refer you, again, the the CDC. Specifically the VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) reports.</p>
<p><a href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/vaers.html">https://wonder.cdc.gov/vaers.html</a></p>
<p>For the past decade, Jan 2011 through Dec 2020, there have been 990 reported vaccine related deaths for all vaccines (MMR, DTAP, etc.). We are talking roughly 3-4 billion doses here.</p>
<p>From Jan 2021 to now, there have been 3391 reported deaths. That's over 3 times as many deaths in 4 MONTHS as there were in 10 YEARS. And consider this is for only a few hundred million doses, not billions.</p>
<p>The COVID vaccines are many, many TIMES more fatal than all the other vaccines COMBINED. Approximately THREE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more fatal.</p>
<p>If you choose to inject yourself with untested poison, go for it. Don't expect the rest of us to go along with your delusion. I'll stay in the "control group" thank you very much.</p>

        <p>You. Can't. Kill. An. Airborne. Virus.</p>
<p>Vaccines do not kill viruses. Full stop. That is not and never has been how they work. You can not eradicate an airborne virus. It isn't possible in any way, shape, or form with modern technology. We can't even successfully eradicate HPV or Herpes and they aren't even airborne. Vaccines prepare the immune system to help it fight off the infection quicker, but they do NOT kill or prevent you from contracting the virus.</p>
<p>Viruses spread, immune systems fight them off, they mutate and spread again, immune system fights off the new strain. This has been ongoing for billions of years long before mammals even existed. It's part of life, we move on and deal with it just like we have with Influenza and SARS in the past.</p>
<p>COVID-19 is here to stay. In fact, COVID is just a mutation of fucking SARS, so it has already existed for years. It existed last year, it exists this year, and without some insane nanotechnological breakthroughs it will still exist in 100 years.</p>

        <p>That says nothing about eradication. It is considered "contained" because of extremely low transmission rate. </p>
<p>It's not something anyone would even consider testing for, even if someone had it they would either stay home sick for a couple days or go to the doctor, where the doctor wouldn't even bother to test them for anything, they'd send them home and tell them to drink Gatorade and sleep. Much like Influenza there is no medicinal cure for it, hence why doctors don't test for it. </p>
<p>Shit, even when I had mono I had to see 3 different doctors to get a diagnosis because the first two told me to stop being a bitch and go sleep because "its flu season". I could have had SARS every year and I would have never known. The third only decided to not be a complete twat and actually run a test because I literally couldn't open my eyes by that point.</p>

        <p>The issue is viruses mutate and we don't want this to be jumping around the population to the point where current vaccines become ineffective. I get that it's frustrating because it's all hypothetical, but they're pushing the vaccine because it's the easiest way to eradicate Covid. We're seeing how successful high rates of vaccination can be; just take a look at Israel's vaccination rate compared to cases and deaths</p>
<p>It's not just a power play. Most countries on earth didn't get together and agree that they would see how far they could take Covid to exercise control on their population. India's healthcare system has collapsed and represents the exact outcome everyone has been trying to avoid</p>

        <p>“they're pushing the vaccine because it's the easiest way to eradicate Covid”</p>
<p>No lol they are pushing it because they think that is how it will work. They don’t know for sure if it will work or not. This has never been done before. They have done similar things, like with chicken pox but I would actually argue that they created more issues by doing that. Also chicken pox still exists.</p>
<p>Israel will definitely be the one to watch on wether this theory will actually work in the long run. You are right about that.</p>
<p>“It's not just a power play. Most countries on earth didn't get together and agree that they would see how far they could take Covid to exercise control on their population.“</p>
<p>You are right about that, however American politics have shown time and time again that they like to use situations to their advantage whenever they arise. It isn’t a power play, but if you really think that the politicians are not trying to use this to pass stuff politically then you are mistaken. A lot of stuff has already passed because of Covid that would have originally been very controversial.</p>
<p>“India's healthcare system has collapsed and represents the exact outcome everyone has been trying to avoid“</p>
<p>India, has a lot more issues that Covid though. If COVID was the only issue there you would see the exact same thing happening in the USA.</p>

        <p>I am completely sympathetic to people who want to see how things shake out in the short to medium term. We'll all be anxiously watching Israel. </p>
<p>Regarding American politics, my broader point is that the environment of Covid isn't a political invention. It's out there and it's deadly, and people very close to me are still working on Covid ICU floors. I agree that politicians will try to make the most out of any set of circumstances they're in, but that's what politicians do. Politicians being politicians is a far cry from conspiratorial thinking. </p>
<p>And yes India was ripe for this type of collapse, but NYC was in very bad shape early last year as well. My one family member who lived there at the time said it was hard to fall asleep just from all the ambulances</p>

        <p>Unchecked spreading of the virus is exactly what's happening and it's not a big deal. The face-diaper, antisocial behavior, and hand wringing farce is just a placebo so people feel like they are doing something while we wait for everyone to get it and move on. Same with the vaccine. CDC admits the vaccines DO NOT STOP YOU FROM GETTING COVID. If you think it does, you are mistaken and a "science denier", to use the quaint lib term.</p>
