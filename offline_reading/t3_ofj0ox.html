    <strong>I DO NOT CARE!</strong>
    <p><p>In the UK the government is making masks a personal choice from 19th July onwards and I am so sick of the people protesting this decision. I just want to scream from the rooftops - I DO NOT CARE!</p>
<p>I do not care if you feel vulnerable with people not wearing masks. Stay at home if you feel safer! 
I do not care if you think I am selfish - it's selfish of you to expect me to do ANYTHING for your own benefit and at the detriment of my comfort and preference. </p>
<p>I literally do not care. We are not a "community" - you don't know me and I don't know you. I don't owe you anything, and frankly I DO NOT CARE what makes you feel better. Your feelings are your own and I am entitled to do what I want. I just want to scream I DO NOT GIVE A S*** ABOUT YOU.</p></p>

        <p>Like a dog getting taught tricks with treats, eventually the dog does the command without the treat.</p>
<p>I am of the view that the masks are being made voluntary to identify % programmed, and how well the propaganda has worked.</p>
<p>No doubt it will become mandatory again and ditched again to identify the rate of programming.</p>

        <p>I was listening to people call in on radio 2, they were either furious or already getting anxious. </p>
<p>People were saying that they wouldn't be able to go into shops if people weren't masked up and they're already worried about it. </p>
<p>Apparently we're selfish for not covering up to protect others. I nearly called in to say "if someone's health is on me, where do I draw the line, do I remove unhealthy items from their shopping trolley and stop them from smoking and drinking?".</p>

        <p>Honestly! They are failing to grasp this very VERY simple concept - WE DO NOT GIVE A SHIT whether you feel/are safe or not. Can someone please explain this to me - how can you refuse to accommodate to your own needs (by staying indoors), yet expect a complete stranger to accommodate to your needs (by wearing a mask or getting vaxxed)? </p>

I'm not responsible for them fat asshats who can't exercise, eat junk and then keep shouting how at risk they are and we have to accommodate this. If you fkin at risk then why you even outside.

        <p>Better yet, if you believe in the propaganda that much, then shouldn’t you be safe if you’re wearing a mask and got the vax? It’s so effective, right? If it’s so effective on its own, other people shouldn’t affect you.</p>

        <p>Radio 2 is propaganda bollocks. Probably all those people were actors, paid to call up and cry down the phone. If you had called in with some common sense they’d never have put you on air. People in my real life aren’t freaking out so that’s how I judge it.</p>

        <p>Could not agree more. Honestly even if it was all as they say it is - when did it become MY responsibility to coddle your insecurities?! If I was scared of breathing air outdoors I would stay at home - simple. If you choose to go out then deal with the consequences of your actions. I cannot even explain how much I simply DO NOT give a shit whether you feel well or not. You could not begin to imagine how little I care about you or your personal wellbeing.</p>
<p>I think the root of the problem is that they assume that we have a duty to care about them - which we do not.</p>

        <p>The transport secretary already said they still might make masks a condition of carriage. Ie no mask - no entry on the public transport. Same with shops. The guidelines are ambiguous at best, the govt are trying to shift the decision making on someone else. As long as it’s simply encouraged but not enforced I couldn’t give a fuck. You want to wear it? Wear the fucking thing. No? Don’t wear it. Just don’t get into anyone’s face trying to pick a fight over personal choices. That goes both ways.</p>
<p>But yea, i agree with you. It’s not my problem that someone feels personally threatened because someone else chose not to wear a mask. Like literally, fuck off. I have got enough shit going on</p>

        <p>Exactly. They would not think twice if I got vaccinated and suffered ill effects or died - just another statistic. Yet I'm supposed to care enough about a bunch of strangers to put experimental toxins in my body and walk around with a mask all day because you never learned to THINK for yourself? </p>

        <p>We don’t give a fuck in the UK now anyway. Once the Health Sec got caught bonking his secretary we all stopped caring. The PM knows this so he had to say let’s open up even with bullshit case numbers rising faster than ever. </p>

        <p>Our leaders are a joke. Our "reopen plan" currently is a 3 step process, which actually started at step 0 with nothing changing after our most recent lockdown for 2 weeks. The steps are based off of vaccination rates which we hit the benchmark for step 3 while in step 1 but the other benchmark they had was that we couldn't move from one step to another for at least 21 days. And throughout this entire reopening plan, there is no step for fully open. </p>
<p>The difference between step 1 and step 2 was allowing 6 people to eat on a patio at a restaurant instead of 4. </p>
<p>Confused yet? I know we all are. It's just a big farce, and unfortunately, there are so many people that support whats going on in Ontario. Just sad.</p>

        <p>In my home state (Massachusetts) people online were livid when our governor announced the end of indoor masks.  People vowed to wear masks forever, boycott any business that didn't require masks, etc.</p>
<p>Fast forward over a month, and it's a rarity to see a person in a store with a mask.  Even the "masks forever" crowd is hanging maskless in crowded places. I predict the same scenario for the UK.</p>

        <p>Yeah you don’t need to go to such extremes there bud. Covid is not your every day flu or virus. We haven’t seen something this infectious on such a scale in a long time. I most definitely could have passed something on but I am taking measures to ensure that the possibility is as minimal as possible. As opposed to the willful ignorance and outright neglect I see posted on this sub. It’s depressing and the mentality of the people here is disgusting and selfish. People are literally comparing the government loosely enforcing vaccine recommendations to Nazi Germany. It’s insane.</p>

        <p>Of course it was an exaggeration, because you’re being extremely dramatic. Exaggerations are the only thing that will get the point across.</p>
<p>If you call people selfish for wanting to live their own lives, yet you think everyone should change what they’re doing because some people are scared of a virus with a 99.85% survival rate, it’s not hard to stop and think maybe you’re the selfish one</p>

        <p>Man you sure do like to jump through some hoops to get to that logic. I have no urge to try to reason with someone who ignores simple facts. We have been in this pandemic long enough that if you truly feel this way and believe the bullshit you just spewed then I hope you have a shitty day. I would hope for some self reflection but you are clearly unable to do so. Educate yourself and get off social media. Get out in the real world and talk to real people.

        <p>Yeah duh dipshit. I’m not scared of anything involving covid either. Doesn’t mean I can’t follow simple basic guidelines to help others. You are LITERALLY being told to wear a mask because it can help protect others and instead you say “Fuck that. Masks are mildly uncomfortable and it makes me a sheep. Isn’t that right echo chamber?” Wear a mask. Get the vaccine. Stop being a little pussy ass snowflake.</p>

        <p>Haha yeah that’s what you all like to scream about but none of that shit happened here. You were asked and not told. No one is trampling on your rights. Other countries actually had the balls to enforce these rules and give out tickets and even jail time. Not in America though. You could brazenly defy orders meant to protect others because your fragile ego couldn’t take it and no one stopped you. Then the infection spread out of control and America became one of the hardest hit countries. Infection rates and deaths were so much higher than they should have been because people wanted to stick it to the man. So yeah you can go fuck yourself with your misguided anger at being “oppressed.”  It’s a fucking joke and you are a moron.</p>
