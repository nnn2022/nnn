    <strong>Just need to vent- no one seems to get it</strong>
    <p><p>I lost my grandma today at age 91. I have not been allowed to hug her since March. The last visit I got was through a window and she couldn’t hear me. She had late stage althizmers along with hearing loss so it was hard if not impossible to talk on the phone. She died alone. I couldn’t see her due to this “pandemic”. I am angry.</p></p>

        <p>&rt;The most terrible aspect of the obsession with saving lives, for me, has been the way the old have been left to die alone during these past few months. This is unconditionally wrong. To justify it as an unfortunate, temporary trade-off — or as a necessity in service to the greater good — misses something fundamental. The dying should be accompanied and held, comforted and mourned by those they have loved and who have loved them. No calculus of health and safety should limit this defining obligation: it simply belongs to us as human beings. That safety has supervened over humanity in this way helps illustrate the substitution of lives for persons. Persons are unique — each will be born and die only once, and the respect due to these two great passages is absolute. There are fates worse than death, and one of them is the bullying of the old into the self-serving belief that we have incarcerated and abandoned them for their own good.

        <p>When I went in October we talked through a window. Her hair was overgrown and her nails weren’t cut. I called the home and they claimed that they couldn’t get anyone in to do their hair or nails “due to covid”. I am suspecting a lot of shitty nursing homes are covering up abuse and neglect this way.</p>

        <p>I’m truly sorry, prayers for your grandmother. This plandemic has gone far enough. Seniors are dying alone, suffering depression, becoming physically weak because they can’t leave their apartments/homes, drug addiction reoccurrence etc. We are losing a great generation that are forced to be left alone at the end of life.</p>

        <p>Sorry to hear, that really sucks. If you want, share some stories about who she was and her life. My belief is we live on through our memories and stories. You have the right to be angry. It makes me angry. By telling the story you are getting it out there and hopefully these stories are starting to change people's minds about the reality of what is going on.

        <p>It's particularly painful when a LOT of the elderly believe the same stuff this sub does (they're just not on Reddit), and 20 and 30 something weirdos want to keep them locked down for life.</p>
<p>Hot take: When they have their family by their side, sure it's sad when an old person dies, but if someone is over 80, ultimately we should celebrate their life and use their funeral/cremation/whatever as an opportunity to reconnect with family and friends of the deceased, it's what they would want! I always found something oddly beautiful in the funeral for a very old person being packed with tons of people. It shows that they made a very real and lasting impact on this Earth.</p>
<p>It's perfectly natural for old people to die, and whether it's COVID or something else is irrelevant...we need to let them spend as much time as possible with loved ones; it's why I always love talking to the elderly, they have so much to share and deserve to enjoy the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>If an old person wants to self-isolate, absolutely let them, but if they want to be around family, it is cruel and evil to deprive them of that.</p>

        <p>I just don't get this.</p>
<p>I know doctors are trying to be extra-careful, but why not allow visitors in special cases with extra precautions for a shorter time period, like dressed up with all protective gear, honestly I would even use an oxygen cylinder or whatever is needed to be safe?</p>
<p>I admit it's not easy, it's cumbersome, but at least it would be somewhat human.</p>
