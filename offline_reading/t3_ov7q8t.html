        <p>They are very cautious about not using ivermectin.</p>
<p>But go ahead with the experimental "vaccine".  Even though we haven't even finished the trials and it hasn't been approved, don't worry about it.  It's still fine.</p>

        <p>&rt; They are very cautious about not using ivermectin.</p>
<p>Yet have no qualms about using mechanical ventilators,  which have just as many negatives as Ivermectin might,  but actually have a measurable negative impact on <em>long-term</em> outcomes.  You never ever want to be on a ventilator if you can avoid it.</p>
<p>You can get a free kit in Seattle that's designed to help you safely consume heroin through your rectum,  but the FDA will throw the book at you if you go off-label with an anti-parasitic in an effort to save your own life.</p>

        <p>Listen, this vent thing is really silly. No offense. I practice critical care medicine and vents are not a therapy. Never have been. They keep you from dying a few extra days. It's not a choice between vent and no vent.. the choice is vent and live a few more days, hoping your lungs heal in the meantime, or death today. </p>
<p>I can explain further if you like, but your understanding of this is really off.</p>

<p>No..  that's exactly how I understand it,  which is,  basically:  "a coin flip."  So,  if that's the "last line" of care you have available,  not pouring everything you have into effective treatments is criminal.</p>
<p>&rt; I can explain further if you like, but your understanding of this is really off.</p>
<p>What is the 1, 2 and 5 year survival rates for those who have been attached to a ventilator for the average amount of time a surviving COVID patient does?  What are common side-effects,  both permanent and temporary that occur from ventilator usage?</p>

        <p>I don't think you get it. The vent isn't an optional thing. At the point you need it,, You either get it, or you die. </p>
<p>Given that your body is pretty damaged if you need a vent, the survival depends on that underlying organ dysfunction.</p>

        <p>1) yeah, sort of. Theres people who start to get really bad, but sort of pull through at the last second without the vent. Then there's others that progress and it's hard to tell who is who. </p>
<p>2) in the setting of covid, no, it's often the lungs that are the primary issue. In other disease processes, sometimes. But there are many situations where all the organs fail together such as in bacterial or viral sepsis and the treatment is targeted towards the infection.</p>

        <p>I don’t think you’re incorrect, but I don’t think that is really their motivation. They need to keep Ivermectin suppressed along with other helpful unusual treatments until the VAXxx Has enough time to really dig in and mess up the immune system. That way you will continue to require more shots.  </p>
<p>That is really the goal, more frequent more reoccurring injections.</p>

<p><strong>2018</strong>      </p>
<p><strong>Really think about that date.</strong>    </p>
<hr>
<p>&rt; From FDA.gov:
&rt; From February through the middle of May, the FDA issued a total of 59 EUAs for IVDs for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 based on validation data using contrived specimens derived from SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. As the pandemic progressed and more patient specimens became available, on May 11, 2020, <strong>the FDA recommended in the Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests that developers obtain and use patient specimens to validate their tests.</strong> So just from Feb-May 59 tests were authorized (so how many since then?) and the FDE recommended testing against real samples.  </p>
<p><strong>I can’t believe they would actually allow test developers to obtain and use patient specimens to validate their tests without isolating, purifying and examining under an electron microscope. UNREAL.</strong>  </p>

<hr>
<p>&rt; “I think if a country said, “You know, we need to end this epidemic,” They could quietly send around a memo saying: “We shouldn’t be having the cutoff at 37. If we put it at 32, the number of positive tests drops dramatically. If it’s still not enough, well, you know, 30 or 28 or something like that. So, you can control the sensitivity.”  </p>
<p>&rt; <a href="https://uncoverdc.com/2020/04/07/was-the-covid-19-test-meant-to-detect-a-virus/">Yes, you read that right. Labs can manipulate how many “cases’ of Covid-19 their country has. Is this how the Chinese made their case load vanish all of a sudden?</a>  </p>
<hr>
<p>&rt;Jessica C. Watson from Bristol University confirms this. In her paper “Interpreting a COVID-19 test result”, published recently in The British Medical Journal, she writes that there is a “lack of such a clear-cut ‘gold-standard’ for COVID-19 testing.”  </p>
<p>&rt;But instead of classifying the tests as unsuitable for SARS-CoV-2 detection and COVID-19 diagnosis, or instead of pointing out that only a virus, proven through isolation and purification, can be a solid gold standard, Watson claims in all seriousness that, “pragmatically” COVID-19 diagnosis itself, remarkably including PCR testing itself, “may be the best available ‘gold standard’.” But this is not scientifically sound.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&rt;Hence, we have asked the science teams of the relevant papers which are referred to in the context of SARS-CoV-2 for proof whether the electron-microscopic shots depicted in their in vitro experiments show purified viruses.  </p>
<p>&rt;But not a single team could answer that question with “yes” — and NB., nobody said purification was not a necessary step. We only got answers like <a href="https://bpa-pathology.com/covid19-pcr-tests-are-scientifically-meaningless/">“No, we did not obtain an electron micrograph showing the degree of purification”</a>   </p>
<hr>
<p>&rt;Countless labs have reported a 100 percent positivity rate, which means every single person tested was positive. Other labs had very high positivity rates. FOX 35 News found that testing sites like one local Centra Care reported that 83 people were tested and all tested positive. Then, NCF Diagnostics in Alachua reported 88 percent of tests were positive.  </p>
<p>&rt;How could that be? FOX 35 News investigated these astronomical numbers, contacting every local location mentioned in the report.  </p>
<p>&rt;The report showed that Orlando Health had a 98 percent positivity rate. However, when FOX 35 News contacted the hospital, they confirmed errors in the report. <a href="https://www.fox35orlando.com/news/fox-35-investigates-florida-department-of-health-says-some-labs-have-not-reported-negative-covid-19-results">Orlando Health's positivity rate is only <strong>9.4 percent, not 98 percent</strong> as in the report.</a>   </p>

        <p>Thank you for pointing that out. However, this article refers to several studies and the paper which has been retracted supports only a very small part of the author's case; he mentions the Elgazzar study more or less as an aside. Mr. Henderson's convincing argument is not weakened by the omission of this detail.</p>

        <p>The article was poorly cited and a list of references were not provided at the end. However, from the two articles that were hyperlinked, one was theoretical and the other was conducted in vitro (so, done in a Petri dish). I can’t find any clinical studies involving humans.</p>

        <p>This highlights an important point about experimental treatments. If experimental medical treatments have any place, it’s with patients about to die, like the bottom tweet says. It is NOT with the entire healthy public in the form of a forced experimental vaccine. </p>
<p>So much of the Covid response has been absolutely backwards.</p>

        <p>Their caution for Ivermectin because they're needlessly questioning of its efficacy (despite mountains of data) is ridiculous considering the alternative they're pushing is a vaccine in which has questionable efficacy as well as known harmful short-term side effects and unknown long term effects.</p>
<p>It's a double standard that no sensible person should be willing to overlook, given the profit vaccine companies have made.</p>
<p>This isn't about safety or efficacy. It's about money and power. If you haven't jumped aboard the NWO conspiracy, you are either naively optimistic or gravely ignorant.</p>

        <p>So, the same “experts” (doctors?) saying “Take this experimental treatment” are the same ones saying we need more data on the treatments that have been used all over the world for decades?

        <p>Reminds me of something my mom told me once. There was this doctor that had his family practice and this man that kept coming to his office for something that was bothering in his ear. He kept having this issue for years. When the doctor’s son became a doctor himself, he treated the same man for the same thing bothering him in his ear. The son was able to figure out what was wrong with the man. He goes really excited to tell his father; “Dad I finally figures out what was bothering Mr. Jones’ ear, he had a tick inside his ear canal!” To which his father answers, “Son, that tick is what paid for your medical school.”</p>

        <p>To be really fair. All the ivermecin studies used in the big metastudy were small. The real scandal is that they never organized a big study somewhere end of last year when the metastudy was published. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>swprs did inform early about ivermecin and the article were most time positive. But here is an article that look at it more critical. I think it's important to also see something one is in favor critical: <a href="https://swprs.org/the-ivermectin-debate/">https://swprs.org/the-ivermectin-debate/</a></p>
<p>To the WHO speaking against Ivermecin the article states:</p>
<p><em>Some of the weakest arguments against ivermectin include questioning its safety (as done by Merck, the WHO and the US FDA, despite the fact that it is one of the safest drugs in the world), or calling it a “veterinary medicine” (it is used as an anti-parasitic drug in both humans and animals, as are many other drugs). Such dubious arguments, as well as some rather obvious</em> <strong><em>conflicts of interest</em></strong><em>, raise legitimate questions about the motivations of some of the critics of low-cost ivermectin.</em></p>
