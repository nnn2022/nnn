        <p>I find this to be a vital question, and I think the answer is self evident.</p>
<p>The reason covidists have focused on 'The Children' is that Covid is intertwined with a long-emerging 'Globalist Neo-Marxist Movement' and these types of movements ALWAYS focus on indoctrinating children.</p>

        <p>For masking children, I suspect the same reason they closed schools even though their early models (which are worthless anyway) showed closing schools wouldn't make much difference- bc they were an easy target. The government has a lot of control over schools and daycares, it was easy to close them down or force masks on kids. That way they could be seen as doing something. And it upsets a smaller segment of the population, those who don't support masks and have children. There's plenty of people who don't support masks or shutdowns but who also don't have kids so it's not really something that's on their radar. And of course we can't forget the teachers unions and some parents who want it. Never mind the WHO does not reccomend masks for kids under age 12.</p>

        <p>Yeah that is certainly a big part of it! IMO the over-arching theme  is that we have suffered a globalist putsch and removing child care was a big help for 'great reset'.</p>
