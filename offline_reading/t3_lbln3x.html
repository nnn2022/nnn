    <strong>[Germany] Chancellor Merkel admitted vaccinations will be mandatory</strong>
    <p><p>On TV that absolute fucking bitçh said everyone who refuses to get vaccinated will basically be excluded from living the "normal" life. </p>
<p>Remember how a few months ago they called us the "conspiracy theorists"? Clowns. I would say I can't wait to finally leave this absolute trash ass fucking country but I just know eventually it will be just like this everywhere. I despise humanity. I pray these people all get fucked</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://twitter.com/twinkreality/status/1356712057471696898?s=21">Here</a> is a link to one of the videos for those who want proof. It's german tho</p></p>

        <p>OH god, bringing back memories of when NSA spying finally came out.    </p>
<p>I remember for the years leading up to it how people acted like the idea the NSA was spying on basically all phone and internet traffic was an absurd conspiracy.   Said we'd been watching too many bad movies.   </p>
<p>Then it all comes out, and I distinctly remember how everywhere you went people were suddenly pretending like everyone already knew this and it was all old news.    </p>
<p>I suspect it's a defense mechanism of weak minds.</p>

<p>Remember, they want you to give up your property rights <strong>and</strong> get vaccinated. If you refuse to do both, you will be confined to your home or taken to a quarantine camp, and not allowed to participate in society until you get the shot or get "re-educated".</p>

        <p>You know whats a wild thing? If they didnt coerce people like this id be more likely to take it. But the fact they are either directly or indirectly forcing people into it makes me completely uninterested in taking it. </p>
<p>As for the property rights, there is no way in hell youd convince me to give up something my family has accumulated trough generations. Not even if i see every single one of these billionaires give up all of their property too.</p>

        <p>They're doing it this way because, otherwise, most would not voluntarily take this. They instilled fear in the populace to get them frightened and illogical enough to comply. Then they use manipulation tactics for the rest of us.</p>
<p>As for the second part of your comment... Well, someone posted the Canadian leaked document on here a few minutes ago, and this is what they say will happen to those of us who don't comply:</p>
<p>&rt; Committee members asked who would become the owner of the forfeited property and assets in that scenario and what would happen to lenders or financial institutions, we were simply told “the World Debt Reset program will handle all of the details”. Several committee members also questioned what would happen to individuals if they refused to participate in the World Debt Reset program, or the HealthPass, or the vaccination schedule, and the answer we got was very troubling. Essentially we were told it was our duty to make sure we came up with a plan to ensure that would never happen. We were told it was in the individuals best interest to participate. <strong>When several committee members pushed relentlessly to get an answer we were told that those who refused would first live under the lock down restrictions indefinitely. And that over a short period of time as more Canadians transitioned into the debt forgiveness program, the ones who refused to participate would be deemed a public safety risk and would be relocated into isolation facilities. Once in those facilities they would be given two options, participate in the debt forgiveness program and be released, or stay indefinitely in the isolation facility under the classification of a serious public health risk and have all their assets seized.</strong></p>
<p>Either way, they're going to take your shit, bro.</p>

        <p>Good luck leaving society.</p>
<p>No, really. I mean it.</p>
<p>Because they're going to make it very, very difficult for people to flee into the woods, as many on here claim they will do. With all the surveillance going on, along with drones and other tech, and law enforcement and rangers, they will ensure that settlements that exist outside the designated living zones will be eliminated. The inhabitants will probably get sent to those isolation facilities with other dissenters.</p>

        <p>Sure in the west there is a lot of surveillance. But any third world country is lagging behind significantly.<br>
Is this the human settlements thing youre talking about? I saw this blond chick talking about it a while back. 
But hey, if this is really where this is going, i dont mind taking myself out. As I said, im free spirited, this medical dystopia is my worst kind of nightmare as i hate hospitals, cant stand needles and even less so control over my life
PS: im not planning nor am i suicidal right now, but if the world really turns like this then sorry bb im outta here lol</p>

        <p>I don't know... I just find it difficult to laugh at these notions. All of the predictions have been coming true, and the Canadian government leaked documents this stuff is coming from seems to be right on nearly everything so far. I'm not seeing the light side of this at all. I hate seeing my life slowly being ruined, all because a bunch of tyrants want to see their vision of a utopia realized.</p>

        <p>Believe me, I hate is as much as you. Ive been following this shit from its early onset and it depressed me into oblivion. </p>
<p>Now i just do what i can and look into my options instead of letting it drag me down. Moping around wont fix anything, but speaking up and sorting your life according to your beliefs might. <br>
If this is the case, trust me, less people are on board than it might be apparent. To me it sounds like your modern version of a socialist takeover and they usually dont go smoothly with no resistance.</p>

        <p>All things considered precious metals should be much higher priced and i think they're more a "store of value" than an investment.  They're perfect in other ways as you can buy them in cash :) <br>
Youre not the only one thinking a crash might be coming. The stock market is bloated to levels not seen not even in 2008.</p>

As it is now, there's not even enough vaccine to demand that everyone takes it.

        <p>I agree it's not entirely impossible that someone else will try to push it, but I really don't see how they could actually pull that off. The way I see it, all they can do is to make up an unenforceable law, because for something like that to actually work would you'd need a vaccine that anyone can take, which we do not have. I mean, c'mon. Think about it. By barring unvaccinated people from say air travel, you'd automatically disallow air travel for anyone with serious allergies, kids, and everyone else who can't be vaccinated whether they want or not, which would be like half the population. Not to mention that getting your doctor to write you a paper saying you're allergic to bees or whatever isn't really that hard. Let's be realistic here ;)</p>

        <p>I'm not saying it will be just like before. Clearly some things will change, because they always do. But believe you me, if you have a society that's accustomed to some basic liberty, shit like what we see today can't possibly last for very long. I grew up in Poland under soviet rules and I've seen that shit. The exit won't be pretty, but it will happen.</p>

<p>What you're getting from Politicians is the theatre of politics. </p>
<p>We're entering the most difficult stage now - where governments are trying to increase uptake of a vaccine in healthy members of the population who are not at personal risk of death or injury from Coronavirus. They can bribe you, bully you, manipulate you, encourage you, frighten you, </p>

        <p>Unfortunately, that is not legally binding for any EU country, it's just a recommendation.</p>
<p>I think they did that, to ensure if enough people are against vaccinations, that we'll 'see' a path for our local countries to forbid vaccinations would be to push for making EU regulations override our local laws, so we push towards that. </p>
<p>In that case, if enough of people are against vaccinations, then Schwab and others will get stronger EU laws integrations, so for next "pandemic" they won't need to bribe all our countries, only the EU parliament. So they would win, even if they temporarily lose on mandatory vaccinations.</p>

        <p>Don't believe the hype! They are fighting with all possible resources: smear campaigns, using all kind of media to infiltrate us with their lie, fear mongering and so on. More and more people are seeing through their sick mind game. Now it's on us. We have to go on the streets and demand, what the government, the big industries and other entitled persons stole from us: our sovereignty, our freedom, our security, our rights and our prosperity. The politicians are supposed to represent the people and govern in their favor. Don't you think it's time to remind them that they weren't? Enough is enough.

        <p>I used to be a smug **** who enjoyed saying 'I told you so' - in the past year I've never wished more that I could just be wrong about everything, and that I was completely off track. The sad thing is, that when we say stuff now, people still call us nutters, even though everything we've banged on about in the last 12 months has come to pass, and worse.</p>

        <p>2020/2021: the year that "conspiracy theorists" were vindicated</p>
<p>This is a horrible thing for so many reasons.  But purely from a logistics and messaging standpoint, I don't understand how anybody can be talking about universal vaccination when they can't even seem to get shots to the tiny subset of the population who are eligible and willing.  What's next, mandatory pet unicorns?</p>

        <p>Schikkelgruber has spoken. Here it will lead to disaster. Mothers are already girding up for school requirement coming. That sucking sound you here will be the 100,000+ kids exiting the public school system immediately. So after enforcement starts knocking on the door the first rounds will fly and god help you if my wife is behind the muzzle.</p>

        <p>This has been the goal for years. The covid outbreak just conveniently 'coincided' with new vaccine tech that will underpin the project's rollout. </p>
<p>Currently, these schemers are occupied with figuring our a way to fully suppress ivermectin. This 'wonder drug' has a well documented history of effectiveness against viruses and really has potential to throw a spanner in the works.</p>

<p>I've decided that this is the hill I will die on and take my consequences to stay vaccine free even if it means to go to exile.</p>
<p>This country is awful anyway, I need to give away 45% of the money I earn and literally don't get anything in return. I never was or will become unemployed. Healthcare is so much better in other countries because I can pay for it and almost all old people can barely afford living a good lifestyle anymore. Also it's known that the social system will go down the drains in 10 to 20 years. </p>
<p>Unfortunately 99% are not in such a good position to go to a country where the people will welcome them with open arms and gladly take my German euros in return for not bothering me.</p>

        <p>When I lived in Germany in late 2000s, they did not force any vaccines for daycare or school. I was able to get exemptions for most US states I lived in. Some states exemptions are harder and the state will fight you on your proof.</p>

        <p>The exemption should be that you’re children are exempt from public school and will be partially funded by the state. No one needs the resurgence of eradicated diseases because “vaxeens caws awtizm n mycrowchips.” Full state funding would be qualifiable for those who do have a legitimate negative reaction to inoculation, its not a large number but still too high</p>

        <p>Alabama was a mandatory state when I was in school. A few anti-vax loons tried it and couldn’t enroll their children. If you want to subscribe to baseless pseudoscience by all means go ahead, you don’t get to endanger others because of it. You can’t force people to abide by your religious preferences just like you can’t force people to support your own ignorance and refusal of proven science. Endanger yourself and family members in isolation, leave the rest of us out of it.</p>

        <p>I think you'll find that smallpox and mumps and so forth are many orders of magnitude more dangerous to children than Rona. Even the good old seasonal flu is more dangerous to them. If you wanna stick the Rona vaccine into your toddler, have at it (I guess). But the risk/reward ratio is terrible because the virus itself isn't dangerous.</p>

<p>OP explained that Merkel said people who didn't take the vaccine would be excluded from living a normal life. Meaning the vaccine could still technically be voluntary.</p>

        <p>Yes, it's still voluntary but she said if someone doesn't want to get vaccinated it's possible that they aren't allowed to do other things.</p>
<p>So it's your decision but if you won't get vaccinated you're not allowed to do some things, like visiting restaurants or concerts etc. I think this will happen. Eventim already said that it should be possible to decide if they(all businesses) want only vaccinated people... What will stop them? Nothing. Everyone I know want the vaccine, except 2 friends. I told my dad the side effects he only said: I don't care I will take the vaccine.. :/
The most are sheeps. Just follow, don't think. The TV told it so it's true.</p>

        <p>What’s your problem? If you don’t get vaccinated u shouldn’t be allowed to see others, even vaccinated ppl. Cuz guess what u not being vaccinated allows u to get ppl sick and the virus to mutate. It’s what’s happening with the measles rn. Ppl are getting sick and dying because you and your selfish, self centered human life wasting pricks of friends don’t want to put something in your body that will only help you. Honestly you people disgust me. Hope u get a taste of your own medics and catch corona or your family does. Maybe that’ll teach u a lesson about protecting yourself and others</p>

        <p>Riightttttt, because being vaccinated has always been a requirement to have natural or human rights. I'm guessing that goes back to not only John Locke,  but all the way back to political and moral philosophy in ancient Greece. I bet it even predates ancient Egypt! /s</p>
