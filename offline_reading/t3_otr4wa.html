        <p>Really? I am not huge on physiology but do white blood cells come from the lungs or something? Not calling you a liar, just not sure how damaged lungs impact the immune system's ability to fight an infection.</p>

        <p>Ah 
I get your confusion but as far as my knowledge on the matter goes:</p>
<p>Long paragraph so apologies in advance but I just want to help people understand</p>
<p>White blood cells are part of the immune system.
Those arent the only cells that help in immunity but yes they are the ones that do the most work when we think of "immunity"</p>
<p>But the issue is 
That white blood cells work in tandem with your organs</p>
<p>So lets say hypothetically that you have a disease in your stomach lining right?
Something thats affecting it and not letting you absorb nutrients efficiently </p>
<p>Your immune system meaning white blood cells, platelets, antibodies they all go there to fight off this unknown foreign object affecting your stomach </p>
<p>Lets say they fight it off once.... 
Now they know that if it happens again they can fight it again right?</p>
<p>Problem solved?
Nope</p>
<p>If your stomach itself is weak and cant heal due to some other object you consume that keeps wounding it </p>
<p>Then the virus or whatever that affects your stomach can repeatedly attack the stomach cuz its weak</p>
<p>You get me?</p>
<p>So it doesnt matter if your immune system can fight it off unless your body can heal well enough so that its harder for the disease to take hold.</p>
<p>Now in the case of Covid 
If you smoke
Your lungs get damaged
Thats undeniable</p>
<p>I.e the covid virus has an easier time affecting the lungs of a smoker 
Than the lungs of a non smoker</p>
<p>Even if they both have amazing immune systems.</p>

        <p>Well I could link the articles online that talk about smoking, its effects
And the articles about how the immune system works</p>
<p>But you could google it yourself and find out. </p>
<p>After all I am a stranger to you and one thing I do appreciate about this sub is that people are encouraged to find out on their own.</p>
<p>As you dont know me there is no real reason for you to trust what I say eh?</p>
<p>But from a person speaking to you all the way across the globe and with vastly different experiences 
 My experience mostly comes from my personal life and what I learned as a science student in college </p>
<p>So...yes
If even after searching you cant find information about what I said 
Do let me know 
But I can assure you 
Atleast afaik smoking does affect your lungs 
And so it affects how effective covid is at attacking the lungs of a smoker vs a non smoker</p>

        <p>I can find what ever I want on google. The data is inconclusive.</p>
<p>https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04598594</p>
<p>&rt;There is currently no known treatment for COVID19. <strong>Active smokers are infrequent among patients with COVID-19 which has led our team to hypothesize that nicotine is responsible for this protective effect via the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR).</strong> In fact, nAChR possess the ability to modulate ACE2 expression, the cellular doorway for SARS-CoV2. nAChR modulation by the virus would be responsible for the numerous clinical signs observed in COVID-19, including the cytokine storm manifested in intensive care hyperinflammatory patients.</p>

        <p>One sentence says that
1. There wont be a lot of smokers having covid.</p>
<p>And 
2. If you are a smoker. and you do get covid. Then covid will do more damage to the smoker. Than the non smoker.</p>
<p>How is that contradictory?</p>

        <p>Uh no...
Because while damaged lungs increase the chance of you getting covid and being more affected by it 
Its not the only factor that determines infection by covid 
Whats more important is if your immune system itself is directly affected 
Which is why most of the deaths from covid come from old people.
A smoker with bad lungs but who is healthy in other ways can still not get covid yknw...</p>
<p>Correlation does not mean causation </p>
<p>A smoker isnt more likely to get covid 
But a smoker is more likely to be affected by covid and not survive.</p>

<p>And yes
Genetic material is correct in a manner of speaking 
All cells have genetic material in them 
So technically all our cells can be classified as genetic material.</p>
<p>But usually you just say cells or tissues.
And therein lies the issue 
All cells have genetic material </p>
<p>So smoking causes cancer because of toxins that affect cells is a more apt statement.</p>

        <p>No. That is wrong. I'm not sure where you got this information but you have a fundamental misunderstanding. It is almost exactly the opposite of what you said.</p>
<p>Cancer is caused by the carcinogenic toxins in the smoke. The carcinogenic toxins can cause your dna to replicate incorrectly or just straight up trash it no replication required. Most errors are benign or your immune system takes care of it. Some mutations cause cancer.</p>
<p>Granted damaging lung tissue constantly requires a higher rate of cellular replication to repair. so it makes it far more likely to get cancer. However what you are describing is simply incorrect.</p>

        <p>Ok 
Lung cancer is mostly known as carcinomas yes?
So carcinomas happen when the dna of a cell is damaged or altered and the cells begin to grow uncontrollably.
So like you said dna replicates incorrectly or straight up thrash it.</p>
<p>So arent we both saying the same thing?
Ultimately its the cells that are damaged and by extension the tissue
The difference is that you say genetic material as if its separate from cells.
And I say cells while acknowledging that all cells have genetic material.
Either way thats semantics.</p>
<p>End result is that the cells are damaged</p>

        <p>&rt;White blood cells are part of the immune system.
&rt;Those arent the only cells that help in immunity but yes they are the ones that do the most work when we think of "immunity"</p>
<p>I can agree.</p>
<p>&rt;But the issue is 
&rt;That white blood cells work in tandem with your organs</p>
<p>More or less, homeostasis. The human body is quite good at not dying.</p>
<p>&rt;So lets say hypothetically that you have a disease in your stomach lining right?
&rt;Something thats affecting it and not letting you absorb nutrients efficiently </p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>&rt;
&rt;Your immune system meaning white blood cells, platelets, antibodies they all go there to fight off this unknown foreign object affecting your stomach </p>
<p>Still following.
&rt;
&rt;Lets say they fight it off once.... 
&rt;Now they know that if it happens again they can fight it again right?</p>
<p>Not sure what they fought or how, but still following.</p>
<p>&rt;Problem solved?</p>
<p>Maybe? Still following.</p>
<p>&rt;Nope</p>
<p>I guess not. </p>
<p>&rt;
&rt;If your stomach itself is weak and cant heal due to some other object you consume that keeps wounding it </p>
<p>Still following.</p>
<p>&rt;
&rt;Then the virus or whatever that affects your stomach can repeatedly attack the stomach cuz its weak</p>
<p>Still following.
&rt;
&rt;You get me?</p>
<p>I'm so, so, sorry but, no. I do not understand what the point of your hypothetical stomach disease scenario was.</p>
<p>&rt;So it doesnt matter if your immune system can fight it off unless your body can heal well enough so that its harder for the disease to take hold.</p>
<p>This is a conclusion based on your hypothetical stomach disease scenario?</p>
<p>&rt;Now in the case of Covid 
&rt;If you smoke
&rt;Your lungs get damaged
&rt;Thats undeniable</p>
<p>Damaged lungs, got it.</p>
<p>&rt;I.e the covid virus has an easier time affecting the lungs of a smoker </p>
<p>How? Do you have evidence that tissue damaged by cigarette smoke is more prone or susceptible to covid 19 infection?</p>
<p>&rt;Than the lungs of a non smoker</p>
<p>Again, I would love to see proof.</p>
<p>&rt;Even if they both have amazing immune systems.</p>
<p>Please. You are making claims with absolutely no explanation on mechanism of action.</p>

        <p>Ok 
So your immune system works to either to heal a wound 
Or fight off a foreign object that may cause said wound </p>
<p>The point of my stomach example 
Was to show 
That it doesnt matter if your immune system can fight off a bacteria or virus </p>
<p>If the area that the immune system works to fight it in is already damaged by external factors. </p>
<p>It was to draw a parallel between the external factor in the lungs being smoking 
And the virus then entering the lungs and trying to cause damage</p>
<p>As for my claim on covid 
I am merely applying the basic mechanisms of a normal virus, for instance the common cold virus</p>
<p>To state how smoking compromises your lungs so that they cant heal as effectively compared to the lungs of a non smoker.</p>
<p>I want to impress on you the impact of smoking on your lungs regardless of the virus affecting it.</p>
<p>Bcuz what it means is that the immune system will have to work harder to fight off a virus in a smokers body than a non smokers.</p>
<p>Its pure logic.
Its the same reason that the body of a person who is malnourished takes a longer time to heal his wounds 
Than the body of a person who isnt.</p>
<p>So realize that I am not talking specifically about covid 
Im talking about how smoking makes it easier for a virus, any virus to affect you.</p>
<p>Specifically viruses that are respiratory in nature.</p>
<p>Since your initial question was about the relationship between white blood cells and smoking</p>

        <p>I suspect masks make it spread further by breaking the large droplets into smaller drops that can travel further and hang in the air longer. Wet a cloth put it infront of your face and blow. Tell me I am wrong.</p>

        <p>The science has been lacking, they found enough people willing to test experimental vaccines, but couldn't test mask efficacy.</p>
<p>Granted there are ethical considerations to testing, I just don't see how they could possibly be more profound than testing experimental drugs.</p>

        <p>In my case it was always a common sense that they do work</p>
<p>It was uncommon sense to say that masks dont work.
You are literally providing a buffer between you and the air that you breathe </p>
<p>The better the quality of the mask the more effective it was at stopping droplet transmission. </p>
<p>Not 100 percent of course 
But better than nothing.</p>
<p>And either way 
Youre arguing about wearing a mask
Even if masks dont work

        <p>The virus is something that affects everyone
You thinking only about the welfare of your own self for something that affects everyone is a selfish line of thinking.</p>
<p>In which case having any say in the discussion of the covid virus would have to be framed through the lens of someone who only cares about themselves. If so, its perfectly fine to not want to put on a mask.</p>
<p>I was under the assumption that we were talking as individuals who want the virus to stop affecting both us and people around us.</p>
<p>As for the article
If you choose to ignore the statements of the World Health Organisation
Opinion piece or otherwise from the World.Health.Organisation.(which in this case idk how you came to that conclusion) </p>
<p>Then I cant do anything about that
You wanted proof 
I gave you the proof</p>
<p>Any more proof would require you to carry out actual experiments on your own</p>
<p>Which in this case I doubt would happen.</p>

        <p>No organisation or study will have a good track record
If the WHO doesnt have a good track record then there's no reason to believe other organisations either.
In which case no proof on this earth will be sufficient unless we see it ourselves.</p>
<p>So if you dont believe them 
Theres no reason for you to believe anyone. </p>
<p>For me I dont need proof as my relatives who had lung troubles and were smokers is enough.</p>
<p>I am merely saying this to tell you what I know.
So its not my opinion 
But sure you can say that what WHO has written is opinion if you want. I cant convince you</p>
<p>As for the experiment 
You dont know that WHO hasnt done the experiment 
Neither do you know if they have done it.</p>
<p>But if you choose not to believe an international organisation like that </p>
<p>What chance is there of you believing anything unless you do it yourself?</p>

        <p>Right but whats the point of this post?</p>
<p>To say that if youre none of those things you can just walk around, get covid and youll be fine?</p>
<p>Even if thats true 
It seems like youre telling people not to be afraid of a virus that exists to compromise your body?</p>
<p>Isnt that kinda irrational?</p>
<p>To have no fear of a disease that has currently killed so many people and crippled the world?</p>
<p>On the statement that if youre a healthy person youll be fine?</p>
<p>As far as diseases go 
Isnt the expression "better safe than sorry" the most applicable here?</p>

        <p>Broken down by age, if you are under 18, statistically, you have zero chance of dying.  19-40, near zero.  40-65 - 0.5-1.0%, over 65% 4%. 
But 75% of all deaths were overweight/obese. </p>
<p>Now, add into those stats that everything from car accident deaths, suicides, and drug overdoses (except for one) were assigned as COViD deaths AND COViD tests couldn’t tell the difference from the flu and COViD, then yeah…. Pretty much you can walk around as if there is nothing to be afraid of.</p>

        <p>Hmm 
Ok thats logical </p>
<p>But stats only go so far in determining safety tho eh?
And those stats assume that the individuals are all healthy but in this day and age and judging by the people on this sub in America </p>
<p>Shouldnt we assume that most people are unhealthy regardless of age?</p>
<p>Idk imo </p>
<p>Stats merely tell us the current situation 
But with this virus 
Theres now a delta variant 
And I hope not but there could be other mutations that come up later on </p>
<p>So wouldnt relying on statistics to inform you of whether the virus is something to be afraid of or not be backwards thinking?</p>
<p>Isnt the whole point of the vaccinations and mask mandates to mitigate the risk of the virus transmitting and more importantly preventing its spread and mutation?</p>

        <p>How about we lower the speed limit to 30 mph?  We could limit the top speed of all vehicles in the United States to 30 mph.  Screw it.  20 mph.  </p>
<p>If we did, we could save almost all of the 30,000 people that die in car accidents and almost all of the 4.4 million people that get injured badly enough to seek hospital care.  </p>
<p>Now, it’s safer and would save all those people, and lowering the max speed that cars can go is only a small price to pay to save those lives.   Think of the children.  </p>
<p>If lowering the speed limit to 25 mph saves one life, then it is worth it.  </p>
<p>No….  We could, but we won’t.  Risk is inherent in everything.  If you are scared of riding in a car, you choose not to, you don’t force everyone to drive slower than some runners can sprint. </p>
<p>Now, statistics in this case are flawed, as I mentioned.  Flu wasn’t eradicated in 2020, the tests couldn’t tell the difference between the flu and covid, so both were counted as positive tests, and the tests had high false positive rates as well. But, even using those flawed tests, children were low risk. 18-40 were low risk.  </p>
<p>As for the “purpose of vaccines and mask mandates”…</p>
<p>Do you remember when COViD was new?  People said “the mask is too small to stop a virus.  The weave is much larger than the virus”  Fauci told his friend as much in his emails released by a FOIA request. </p>
<p>The answer was “well, COVID isn’t airborne.  It has to have large droplets to spread”</p>
<p>And then the CDC quietly admitted it was airborne.  But kept the masks.   But ok.  </p>
<p>A normal vaccine using dead, weakened, or live viruses, the same or similar enough to the threat virus to give immunity (cow pox and small pox gives cross immunity). </p>
<p>The mRNA don’t do that.  As to how effective they are:</p>
<p>Pfizer reports they are 95% effective to protect you from getting the virus, and 95% effective from being hospitalized. </p>
<p>A recent Israeli study has shown those numbers were a bit optimistic, but I suggest you read the whole thing. It makes sense that in a plane full of fully vaccinated politicians, 5 people spread it to each other even though the plane had air purifiers.  </p>
<p>Now they are showing that vaccinated people could be super spreaders.  They are asymptomatic, so they don’t feel anything as they shed the virus to others.  Hence the new mask mandates for an effect they had already said would happen when they released the vaccines. </p>
<p>Since vaccinated can still get the virus, and spread it, it would be reasonable to assume that everyone should get vaccinated, so when they catch it, hospitalizations would be minimized, until everyone got it. </p>
<p>Sadly, there are new studies coming out that show that the vaccine actually counteracts your natural immunity, so you’ll need boosters, and the drug companies have ordered billions in drugs (antivirals and anticoagulants) in order to treat breakthrough cases. </p>
<p>The original plan should have been to protect the elderly and at risk, and go about life as normal until everyone got the virus and 99.998% of those people beat it.</p>

        <p>Ok 
Idk about the exact stats of car accidents 
But generally speaking most accidents that do happen, happen because people dont follow the road rules eh?</p>
<p>So in your analogy it wouldnt matter what limit we set because despite any lives well save 
There will still be accidents because people dont follow the rules.</p>
<p>On another note 
Your theory is inherently flawed because car accidents are generally man made yes?</p>
<p>But diseases generally arent 
Ignoring the theory that covid came from a lab which I will neither agree with nor disagree with </p>
<p>The fact remains that diseases spread without human control and in covids case
They transmit when we sneeze or cough or basically do anything that expels particles through the air</p>
<p>As for your mask statement
You basically seem to say that there were a lot of contradictions eh?</p>
<p>Ok 
Well look idk about what people said at the beginning and what faucis email said</p>
<p>But logically speaking 
People make mistakes no?
Especially at the beginning when noone really knows what the virus is like </p>
<p>Is that reason enough to all of a sudden completely stop trusting anything fauci or the cdc or who would say?
Is that reason enough to stop wearing masks?</p>
<p>Masks dont harm anyone do they?
Its purely for protection 
Both you and others around you</p>
<p>So I dont rightly see what the big issue surrounding not following mask wearing would be.</p>
<p>As for the vaccines 
Yes I do believe noone is wrong for being distrustful of that 
Youre having needles stuck in you with god knows what and you dont know for sure it even works.</p>
<p>So I get that skepticism.</p>
<p>But hasnt enough of the world 
For instance New Zealand
Shown that the vaccines do more good than harm?
And if the majority of people themselves have taken it 
And if people themselves who own businesses and stuff have put up notices saying "no entry if not vaccinated" then that means that they have been vaccinated and are doing well and good no?</p>

        <p>Good catch, I meant to write “mechanically or electronically” limit car speeds above when I said “limit” them.  Remove the human element.  If we do that, we can get rid of car accident death. </p>
<p>Are you for that?</p>
<p>“Car accidents are generally man made” — See COViD lab leak theory and vaccine injuries/deaths, as well as the new studies showing they disrupt natural immunity. </p>
<p>“Masks do not harm anyone, do they?”  Well, let’s see.  Pleurisy, collecting bacteria from their air and then keeping it on your face to be touched until you wash it with hospital disinfectant. (When is the last time you did that?), <em>I mean… go to a public bathroom with people pooping.  Those particles are big enough to be transferred to the mask through the air, then they sit on your face in a warm/dark/moist environment for hours and hours</em>,studies showing lowered O2 levels when wearing masks, false feeling of safety/security from wearing a mask that may be ineffective, according to Fauci.  Oh, there are many ways masks could harm people. </p>
<p>New Zealand’s population density is 18 per square kilometer. The US has double that at 35.7 per square kilometer. </p>
<p>New York City’s population density is 38,242 people per square kilometer.  You are comparing apples to oranges. It’s a false equivalency argument. </p>
<p>Does it really mean they are doing well and good?  Or…. Are they bowing to pressure to post those signs?  Places also used to feel justified posting “whites only,” and their neighbors were fine with that. </p>
<p>Now, with what we know about vaccinated passing COVID to both vaccinated and unvaccinated people as asymptomatic spreaders, why would banning unvaccinated people make sense?</p>
<p>If you are ok with taking away liberty for a sense of security, perhaps misguided, what’s to stop you with masks and forced injection of experimental medical treatments?   </p>
<p>Let’s go to the Nuremberg code for guidance.  Can you answer yes to all of these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential.</li>
</ol>
<p>This means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, over-reaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision. This latter element requires that before the acceptance of an affirmative decision by the experimental subject there should be made known to him the nature, duration, and purpose of the experiment; the method and means by which it is to be conducted; all inconveniences and hazards reasonably to be expected; and the effects upon his health or person which may possibly come from his participation in the experiment.</p>
<p>The duty and responsibility for ascertaining the quality of the consent rests upon each individual who initiates, directs or engages in the experiment. It is a personal duty and responsibility which may not be delegated to another with impunity.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The experiment should be such as to yield fruitful results for the good of society, unprocurable by other methods or means of study, and not random and unnecessary in nature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The experiment should be so designed and based on the results of animal experimentation and a knowledge of the natural history of the disease or other problem under study that the anticipated results will justify the performance of the experiment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The experiment should be so conducted as to avoid all unnecessary physical and mental suffering and injury.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No experiment should be conducted where there is an a priori reason to believe that death or disabling injury will occur; except, perhaps, in those experiments where the experimental physicians also serve as subjects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The degree of risk to be taken should never exceed that determined by the humanitarian importance of the problem to be solved by the experiment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proper preparations should be made and adequate facilities provided to protect the experimental subject against even remote possibilities of injury, disability, or death.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The experiment should be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons. The highest degree of skill and care should be required through all stages of the experiment of those who conduct or engage in the experiment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the course of the experiment the human subject should be at liberty to bring the experiment to an end if he has reached the physical or mental state where continuation of the experiment seems to him to be impossible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the course of the experiment the scientist in charge must be prepared to terminate the experiment at any stage, if he has probably cause to believe, in the exercise of the good faith, superior skill and careful judgment required of him that a continuation of the experiment is likely to result in injury, disability, or death to the experimental subject.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I can see several that are answerable by no. </p>
<p>While some will argue “the Nuremberg code is for medical experimentation, not vaccinations!!!” But this is an experimental “vaccine” (but not really a vaccine) that skipped animal trials, and we haven’t been given a list of possible side effects or any idea of how common and rare they are.</p>

        <p>Doesnt mean you shouldnt be afraid 
The world around us didnt get to this point because of "miniscule risk" 
If it truly were miniscule then people wouldnt die
And people have died</p>
<p>In this case the fear comes from the unknown
This virus is new to us.
Hence the need for fear.</p>
<p>If it were like the common cold or a simple flu we wouldnt need to be afraid of course.</p>
<p>But its not.
Its not like im saying the world will end or its some apocalypse eh?
Just that its better to be safe than sorry</p>
<p>Even if you do indeed have nothing to fear</p>

        <p>does mean exactly that. </p>
<p>minuscule doesn’t mean none, thus people die</p>
<p>average age of those who died?</p>
<p>this is why each and every of the the sentences that you put in your comments is a pure fear mongering </p>
<p>time to be concerned was in Q1-2020, since then we know the case fatality rate per demo, since then this CFR was consistently reducing</p>

        <p>Your sense of whats miniscule is flawed then.</p>
<p>A normal everyday disease that people arent afraid of is the cold </p>
<p>The death rate for cold is barely non existent now. Its caused by a virus too</p>
<p>So comparing something like that to something like covid 
Is a massive increase in risk.</p>
<p>Plus for you to say miniscule is you comparing only within the US but you have to take the whole world into account.</p>

        <p>I don’t care about US at all, I’m not american</p>
<p>I open the numbers reported by the government - 300 people of my demo has died in 18 months, among 115k (already 0.3% CFR). almost all of them had diabetes, severe heart / lung issues, cancer / chemo, transplants etc. </p>
<p>it’s beyond minuscule for majority of population</p>

        <p>I assumed you were American as this seems to be a mostly American centred subreddit.</p>
<p>But either way my point stands
Miniscule in one country does not apply to all countries.</p>
<p>Some countries have more elderly people 
Others dont.</p>
<p>Even in my country the deaths have been very small </p>
<p>But it doesnt mean the risk is miniscule of people getting covid 
It just means that the death rate wont be high.</p>
<p>The issue with covid comes from transmissibility more than lethality.</p>
<p>I myself am not afraid even If I do get the virus because im confident I can survive 
But I have elderly family and relatives and I dont want them to be hurt 
Hence why Im saying that its better to be afraid of the virus and take precautions than to just assume youll be alright and stroll along like you have no care in the world.</p>
<p>If you think thats fear mongering then you dont know the plight of the countries and people that dont have the resources to fight the virus</p>
<p>In the grand scale of diseases
Miniscule risk should be stated relative to all diseases
Especially in this case 
Viruses
So Covid definitely isnt miniscule risk relative to other diseases in the world.</p>
<p>Especially as the more it spreads the likelier it is to mutate into something deadlier</p>

        <p>The risk of death is miniscule to the individual </p>
<p>But to say that covid 19 has miniscule risk as a virus 
Is wrong
Bcuz to say that you have to take the whole world into account 
Regardless of their age or ethnicity or nationality</p>
<p>Especially compared to other viral diseases</p>
<p>If you can truly say so youd have to say how less dangerous covid is compared to most viral diseases that exist in the world like the common cold and the flu and Ebola for example</p>

<p>to those diseases where fatality rate is higher, there the risk wouldn’t be minuscule </p>
<p>5% average CFR would be scary af, or the average age of fatality below 50</p>

Especially considering the seriousness of covid in the current world climate.
I am merely saying that its a global issue where thinking as an individual doesnt help anyone.</p>

<p>what you think is not important, really. you can only influence you </p>
<p>maybe there was no dent because you are an island which was on the lockdown since the beginning? or do you think that people are all so great that you “stopped covid” with your positivity?</p>
