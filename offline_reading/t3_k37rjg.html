    <strong>The masquerade hinges on the mask. Link to the suppressed Danish mask study.</strong>
    <p><p><strong>The between-group difference was −0.3 percentage point</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The difference between the mask and the control non-mask group, for infection, was -0.3%.</strong></p>
<p>https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817</p>
<p>Observational evidence suggests that mask wearing mitigates transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is uncertain if this observed association arises through protection of uninfected wearers (protective effect), via reduced transmission from infected mask wearers (source control), or both.
Objective:</p>
<p>To assess whether recommending surgical mask use outside the home reduces wearers' risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a setting where masks were uncommon and not among recommended public health measures.
Design:</p>
<p>Randomized controlled trial (DANMASK-19 [Danish Study to Assess Face Masks for the Protection Against COVID-19 Infection]). (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04337541)
Setting:</p>
<p>Denmark, April and May 2020.
Participants:</p>
<p>Adults spending more than 3 hours per day outside the home without occupational mask use.
Intervention:</p>
<p>Encouragement to follow social distancing measures for coronavirus disease 2019, plus either no mask recommendation or a recommendation to wear a mask when outside the home among other persons together with a supply of 50 surgical masks and instructions for proper use.
Measurements:</p>
<p>The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection in the mask wearer at 1 month by antibody testing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or hospital diagnosis. The secondary outcome was PCR positivity for other respiratory viruses.
Results:</p>
<p>A total of 3030 participants were randomly assigned to the recommendation to wear masks, and 2994 were assigned to control; 4862 completed the study. <strong>Infection with SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 42 participants recommended masks (1.8%) and 53 control participants (2.1%). The between-group difference was −0.3 percentage point</strong> (95% CI, −1.2 to 0.4 percentage point; P = 0.38) (odds ratio, 0.82 [CI, 0.54 to 1.23]; P = 0.33). Multiple imputation accounting for loss to follow-up yielded similar results. Although the difference observed was not statistically significant, the 95% CIs are compatible with a 46% reduction to a 23% increase in infection.
Limitation:</p>
<p>Inconclusive results, missing data, variable adherence, patient-reported findings on home tests, no blinding, and no assessment of whether masks could decrease disease transmission from mask wearers to others.
Conclusion:</p>
<p>The recommendation to wear surgical masks to supplement other public health measures did not reduce the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among wearers by more than 50% in a community with modest infection rates, some degree of social distancing, and uncommon general mask use. The data were compatible with lesser degrees of self-protection.

<p>I fucking KNEW this would be the one thing to fight back against. </p>
<p>And I have. I’ve fought so hard that I actually got into a fight with a masker. He got triggered when I kept telling others they didn’t really have to wear one. </p>
<p>He couldn’t fight very well and ended up fleeing before the cops arrived. They left without so much as writing a report as far as I know. </p>
<p>I haven’t worn that cursed mask one single time. Fuck that.</p>

        <p>In England it's much better. You have to wear a mask in shops and restaurants when you're not sat down but the law is written in such a way that they can't enforce it. Nobody really cares much and most people see it as a bit daft, and only comply because they don't want a fuss. Not ideal but better than in some places where you have to walk round with one even when you're walking down the street with no one around.</p>

        <p>Just for balance, this report is really not as anti-mask as it seems. </p>
<p>The null hypothesis was that wearing a mask cut infection rates by 50% or more.  That was disproven. The data did allow for a reduction of up to 36%.  </p>
<p>Plus, it did not attempt to measure the benefit of the mask when worn by infected individuals to reduce spread.   This is nominally the reason given for mask mandates.  Although like many others, that goalpost has shifted. </p>
<p>Also, this study was with surgical masks, not cloth and not N-95.  Not that people are wearing those, but it makes the results arguable.  ("Yeah, but that study was done with surgical masks.  It doesn't apply to real life).  </p>
<p>It shows what everyone with half a brain realizes, wearing a mask does not mean you can't catch a virus.  But it will take no wind from the sails of people advocating for mask mandates.</p>

        <p>Just to be really clear, this study does not show that masks don't work. Neither does it show that they do.</p>
<p>From the paper:</p>
<p>“The most important limitation is the that the findings are inconclusive.”</p>
<p>“Yet, the findings were inconclusive and cannot definitively exclude a 46% reduction to a 23% increase in infection of mask wearers in such a setting.”</p>
<p>Limitations were:</p>
<p>“Inconclusive results, missing data, variable adherence, patient-reported findings on home tests, no blinding, and no assessment of whether masks could decrease disease transmission from mask wearers to others.”</p>
<p>Because of the small sample size, the confidence interval of the results was huge and, based on this data, the effect of mask wearing could range from a 46% decrease in infection to a 23% increase in infection. That is very inconclusive.</p>
<p>All we can conclude is that in places where infection rates are generally low, and other protective measures are in place, this specific mask recommendation made during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, with background rates of 2% PCR acquisition, failed to show that mask wearing reduces risk by 50%. It may have reduced risk by 46%. It may have increased risk by 23%. Or somewhere in between. We don’t know, because of the way the study was designed and the results they got.</p>
<p>A failure to show statistical difference is not evidence that there is no statistical difference, and the statistical analysis of the results on this study show that it is impossible to give a conclusive answer to the question of whether or not masks work.</p>
