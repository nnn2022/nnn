<p>I wonder what it would look like if they did this same study on working people being forced to wear masks for their entire shifts. It would definitely increase, given the data provided in this study.</p>
<p>https://drtomcowan.com/why-a-study-on-mask-effectiveness-cant-be-trusted/</p>
<p>edit: Here is another interesting study: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7138271/ "Disposable surgical face masks for preventing surgical wound infection in clean surgery" </p>
<p>"Primary outcome: incidence of postoperative surgical wound infection</p>
<p>There were 2106 participants in three trials. <strong>Tunevall 1991 reported 13/706 (1.8%) postoperative wound infections in the masked group and 10/723 (1.4%) in the non‐masked group (no statistically significant difference: odds ratio (OR) 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58 to 3.07).</strong> Chamberlain 1984 reported no postoperative wound infections in the masked group and 3/10 (30%) in the non‐masked group (no statistically significant difference: OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.63). <strong>Webster 2010 reported 33/313 (10.5%) in the masked group and 31/340 (9.1%) in the non‐masked group (no statistically significant difference: OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.97) (Analysis 1.1).</strong>"</p>
<p>I've been sitting on these for a little while, I can't believe we are dealing with most of the public wearing and touching these bacteria ridden germ-sponges.</p>
<p>When you are trying to pull up research like this, add "-2020" to the end of the search so you don't get all the propaganda from this year. https://www.lifehack.org/articles/technology/20-tips-use-google-search-efficiently.html (Any search engine)</p>

        <p>I had read an article not long ago from the British DHS about this as well. I believe it was published in 2016. Basically they found that there was no difference in infection rates whether the surgeon wore a mask or not, and most surgeons wear them out of tradition. Very interesting article. I’ll see if I can find it again.</p>

        <p>Pretty much what these studies are saying. "no statistically significant difference"</p>
<p>Looking at the actual data, there is a slight increase in bacterial infections but maybe there is a margin of error which is why they use "statistically significant". </p>
<p>Tuberculosis: https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis</p>
<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4202234/</p>
<p>Make no mistake, the long-term mask wearers are spreading bacteria all over the place. Pay attention to how many times they touch the mask. (I never touch my face/hair/etc and I never wear a mask. Old habit from food service jobs) Keep your immune system in tip-top shape, especially gut biome. </p>
<p>The virus has never been isolated; Koch's postulates not fulfilled. Bacterial and fungal infections are a real concern. Anti-maskers (especially disabled/medical exemption) should be treating the pro-maskers like walking petri-dish <strong>NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND</strong>. They want everyone sick, that is their goal.</p>
<p>It's one thing to wear a clean mask for 10 minutes in a store. It's a whole other can of worms when employers are forcing their workers to wear them for entire shifts. This is why I will not back down fighting the masks, people who are saying "wear the mask" probably aren't working 8-12 hours for minimum wage in a germ-sponge mask.</p>

        <p>I would perhaps look at studies that focus on infection rates in hospital workers vs the general population, since they tend to wear their petri dishes all day, I imagine it would be much higher.</p>

        <p>They didn't start "wearing them all day" until this year. Good luck finding an honest mask study allowed to be published in 2020. </p>
<p>Interesting how I can find tons of videos people visiting ER pre-2020 and none of the staff say "You can't film here! HIPAA!" Also, no masks.</p>

        <p>It’s really pretty interesting how much medical knowledge comes from “tradition” and has never been thoroughly studied scientifically. A lot of the things we do just because that’s how we were trained. Every few years a paper comes out like this one and everyone’s like HOLY SHIT we’ve been doing it wrong for 50 years! </p>
<p>Anyways, I’m still not sure I would be comfortable getting operated on by a surgeon with no mask, even after seeing a study that shows that it’s probably not that big of a deal.</p>

<p>Yeah totally. I wouldn't know if they wore one or not I guess. They knocked me out pretty good when I had surgery. Shout-outs to my anesthesiologist.</p>

        <p>Do you mind a tldr?</p>
<p>While masks in operation theaters make actually sense, they still come at the severe downside of causing the surgeon oxygen deprivation which comes with several problems like increased risk for mistakes, fatigue, etc.</p>
<p>So it might make sense to find for these instances something that works better as well, like a special faceshield that doesn't interfere with breathing but stops spit as well.</p>
