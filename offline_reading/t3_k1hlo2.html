    <strong>Truth of my fucking chest</strong>
    <p><p>Man.. I really just don't know where to start.. </p>
<p>First of all, thanks to this sub for letting me feel like I'm not the crazy one in this world full of covid propaganda and naive idiots.</p>
<p>I think it's ridiculous that in 2020, where people supposed to be smart and developped and have all the mediums to do their research do exact the opposite of what they are supposed to do; asking questions. Not believing one just because they said so.</p>
<p>It pains me to see children growing up in a world where they think it's normal to wear a mask all in the purpose of "security" - yeah right, that kind of security that makes some people feel safe but actually doesn't do shit. If so many researches showed that wearing a medical mask doesn't even stop aerosols, why does the majority of people believe they are safe? Why are they more than willing to give away their fundamental rights? Why do so many people believe what they're being told? Why do so many people think the government actually wants the best for them?</p>
<p>I could go all day with those kind of questions.. I really just don't understand it. Sometimes I feel like a schizophrenic, sometimes I laugh at people for being so naive and stupid. The other time I could cry for the exact same reason. Seeing this world literally going to shit because of all the sheep's listening. And other times I get mad, all because of the same reason.</p>
<p>There are so many topics I could go on about and give a total fucking rant but I feel like this does it.. For now</p></p>

        <p>My own "research" was mostly getting curious and usually the answers came from the CDC website.  I paid for that research in taxes so I'm going to access it!</p>

        <p>Screw that. I don’t trust anyone (not even myself) not to skew information, whether unintentionally or intentionally. So I trust my own interpretation of information (or the interpretation of people I trust, not random “scientists”).</p>
<p>And it’s funny. I am a Christian, and some think that means you don’t do research and just take whatever your pastor/priest says. And I disagree there too. Take into account what the “experts” say (whether priest or scientist), study whatever information you can find, and make your own decisions. In the end, the consequences are on you.</p>
<p>Even with that, I understand not wanting false information to spread. BUT. Just like I don’t want religious falsehoods suppressed, I don’t want viewpoints on science suppressed.</p>
<p>It’s far better to show WHY information is false and/or wrong than suppressing it. Suppressing it makes it more enticing, and more seem that the “bad guys” are suppressing the truth (which often happens, but also sometimes is not the case). It’s EASIER to suppress, but, in the end, more effective to counter false arguments with MORE research and understanding, not less.</p>

        <p>If anyone would like have to a discussion, whether you're pro covid measurements or against--feel free to send me a message. While I may not completely know USA covid measurements for instance, or the politics (since I'm from the Netherlands) I try my best to understand. I think actual interest makes a conversation a lot easier. Just as long as there are good arguments</p>

        <p>There's a book entitled "Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds." I believe this is what's happening now, unfortunately. I also believe that people have been primed for this type of event because of a lot of technology, especially 'dumb' phones. When everything you see and need in life is encompassed by a little piece of plastic that seems permanently attached to your fingers, we are in trouble. Social media has all but killed actual human interaction and therein lies the rub.</p>
