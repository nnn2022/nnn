        <p>The only upside is that the senate has openly stated that they will not approve the bill.  </p>
<p>Personally, I'd like to have been in the room when the government was asking the SCC if this was legal.  Something they have to do in order to bring in a bill that erode legal rights.</p>

        <p>The Canadian senate is an appointed rubber stamp body. They'll do as they're told, as always. Which is to say, find your way out because the window to do so is closing fast.</p>

        <p>You have a source for that? I’m not aware of the Senate ever rejecting something the House has approved. That’s because they are appointed, not elected. They’re not going to go against their boss.</p>

        <p>I've always been sensitive to things (or sensing things) ever since I've been a young boy, and then when 9/11 happened I really felt something very dark had caused it from behind the scenes. </p>
<p>And when the pandemic started at first I felt "What's going on?", but later that feeling turned to "Wtf is this bullshit scamdemic??" </p>
<p>Everything seems too orchestrated, too perfectly timed. I suspect there is an intelligence that operates at a level beyond human comprehension. It is an entity that does not have any respect for humanity. I feel it. I feel it's presence on this planet, but I could never pinpoint it. But now I've sensed it's running out of time due to some sort of fuck-up that occurred, and so now it's using this scamdemic to usher in its final plans. </p>
<p>I think it has to do with harnessing or trapping our souls to a lower level of existence. It's so hard for me to explain. I just know that the more that people vaccinate then the more we will be cornered into a place where we can't escape from. I am absolutely worried about the future.</p>

        <p>Someone actually asked me that before. I need to buy one of those blood test kits to see if I'm Rh-. Maybe I'm a StarSeed? LOL</p>
<p>As for the "fuck-up", it's difficult to pinpoint, but I believe there are Forces of Good who have been antagonizing this "entity" and/or caused complications or irritations to this "entity's" minions (e.g. the Elites or NWO who obey this "thing"), and I feel that some type of misstep or miscalculation occurred.</p>
<p>Maybe "it" was acting too arrogant with a certain part of it's plan, but then realized it fucked-up or it's minions fucked-up (and subsequently punished/eliminated), which then resulted with this entity having to advance it's own timetable, for the purposes of achieving it's final goal of entrapping our ability to advance as a species and/or to "ascend". </p>
<p>This is just my "gut feeling" is. I realize there is something out there making people sick, but as time progressed I started realizing that the PCR testing is extremely faulty, so I don't put much faith into the actual case numbers being recorded (especially in my country of Canada). </p>
<p>So what I'm saying is it's possible that something very volatile and toxic is being sprayed into the air to infect a particular section of the world, or perhaps water supplies are being poisoned with it. So when we hear and read about those who are suffering from covid in comparison with those who said they had covid but were only sick for a few days, I'm starting to think a lot of confusion and chaos is being deliberately being caused in order to ensure there is no consensus on anything, meanwhile behind the scenes more laws are being created to destroy our civil liberties, and entrap us more into further lockdowns. </p>
<p>This "thing" (the entity) is extremely clever, but I feel it does not have any inkling or understanding of Love, Empathy and Compassion, so I do feel we can beat it and destroy it's minions, but it'll be a very difficult battle. Sorry, I'm rambling on.</p>

        <p>I'm Rh- and I know this sounds weird but everything you say connects because I feel it too. I have a strong feeling you are Rh- as well.</p>
<p>Check this out:
 https://futureofworking.com/11-rh-negative-blood-type-personality-traits/</p>
<p>And you make a very interesting point, I have hope that good will prevail, and that evil's arrogance will be it's downfall. I've always had this un-based personal opinion that we are currently in hell, that this is a lower form of reality, and a few of us were sent here from higher realms to help break the shackles, the vibrations in this reality are very low and difficult to withstand. Maybe our goals is to help others open their mind and live truthful lives to ascend last this evil realm.</p>

        <p>Thank you so much for the link. OMG, I read all 11 points, and I match up with 8. LOL!</p>

<li>For #4, I'm not the smartest person I know</li>
<li>For #9, I don't have one major phobia</li>
<li>For #10, I don't think I have a mental illness (otherwise I wouldn't be able to do the job I do for a living LOL)</li>
</ul>
<p>I really got to get the blood test kit from Amazon, as I'm so curious if I'm Rh-. </p>
<p>Oh, by the way, never fill-out those free online "Family Tree" websites, or never do those free online DNA lineage tests, as that's how "they" try to find Rh- people or try to find certain people who have special abilities based on certain bloodlines here on Earth.</p>

        <p>No problem, there's some excellent Rh- docs, and the ancient Atlantis bloodlines if you're interested, there's another theory that Rh- blood is alien in origin (I know sounds crazy).</p>
<p>It's no guarantee you are, but I have a hunch about you if I were a gambling man lol, could be wrong, but no harm in finding out!  </p>
<p>Edit: And yea, the only reason I know I'm Rh- is I used to be in the military...also Blood donation people are obsessed with getting my blood because it's medical properties help patients, they send me emails all the time lol.</p>

        <p>It's not crazy at all. I think mankind's DNA has been tampered or modified with over millions of years. I think very special human beings who have Rh- blood are being bothered or tracked by certain entities (Reptilians? Greys? Demonic? Biomechanical? Others?). </p>
<p>It concerns me, as it would suggest that these entities are trying to either destroy all Rh- people, or to harness their soul energy. I'm not sure, but there's something going on, and it worries me.</p>

        <p>Thank you so much, I'm glad more people are aware and talking about sensing this "entity" that is causing us suffering and harm. It uses people to dominate and impose its will onto the populace. We need to Love, have Empathy, and be Compassionate. I know it's going to be hard to forgive many of our fellow humans (even I feel great anger and pain), but we have to rise above these assholes, or otherwise we could lose our souls to this coming darkness. I still have hope, and my dreams tell me many things are going to get revealed, but I think the key year will be either 2023 or 2024, and in 2025 all of mankind has to make some sort of world changing decision. I don't know what it is, but I think it has something to do with forgiving our enemies. That will be a monumental task, as I've talked to several friends who want utter bloodshed and destruction upon those foolish people who led us to the precipice of this cliff we're all on. Anyways, I hope my 6th sense is totally wrong. I will continue praying and wishing everyone to be healthy, happy and love each other. It's the only way through this yucky icky miasma mess we're in. It's a miasma of fear that's blanketed the planet, but Love can destroy it. That I know to be true; Love. 💖🙏</p>

        <p>You're not wrong. I've been given the exact same information that humanity has a choice to be made about which direction they're going to choose. If humanity doesn't choose well that doesn't reflect on our fate however if we choose the light. I got the information that 2024 would be a big turning point. Also that the lies and deceptions that have led us here to this point will be revealed slowly over time but gathering speed as we move closer to 2024. I don't believe this is an entity as much as it is a collective negativity that's almost taken on a pseudo-consciousness but it isn't really conscious because it's not part of God.</p>

        <p>It's funny how I've heard so many people who weren't religious, stating the same.  It wasn't the virus, or the people dying that caused people to suddenly become religious.  It was the actions of people in power supposedly acting "for the good of everyone."</p>

        <p>Yea except it’s not media regulation, it’s individual regulation. The media is free to report what is sensational over what people need to know. Why isn’t the war against misinformation focusing on mainstream media and large influencers? </p>
