        <p>My grandmother passed away in 2018. When she went to the hospital the last time we knew she probably wasn't going to make it, so I dropped everything and flew up there to see her. Cost me half my savings but it was worth it; I got to say goodbye, support my mother and aunt, and be there for Grandma.</p>
<p>It would have been a disaster, and for no reason, not to let us visit. If this was 2020, we probably wouldn't have been allowed to see her - and in some states, my mother and I wouldn't have been allowed to even see my aunt because we'd have to quarantine on arrival. Grandma didn't survive 14 days. It was comforting to her to know that family was nearby, and it brought some closure and peace to the living.</p>
<p>What good would it have done to ban us? It would have been cruel to everyone. She was dying. We were healthy adults who chose to be there. Arguably even in 2020 it would have been a bigger health risk to keep us out because it would have hurt our mental health so much, especially my aunt, to know someone we loved very much was dying with no one around and the government decided that was good. FFS let people make their own decisions.</p>

        <p>People that are against hospital visits are sociopaths and fucking losers. They wouldn't dare say any of this shit in person. My mother passed away in the hospital due to neglect imposed by a 3 month lockdown. Ill crack their fucking face in, if they dare say I'm in the wrong.</p>
<p>Ps. My mother was only 48, she wanted to live. I'm only 24. I have lots of life left to terrorize pro-lockdowners.</p>

        <p>I bet if any of those commenters came into a situation where they had to be brought in the ER they would change their tune real quick.</p>
<p>I've been admitted because I've had a seizure (not an epileptic) and I wasn't allowed to see my family because of covid and do you know how much it fucking sucks to be alone when you're scared for you life and wonder if it was because you're having a brain tumour or a stroke and doctors never explaining anything to you? Well, I haven't been properly tested for covid either, they just took my temparature and asked me if I had flu symptoms and then I was moved into a room with an elderly risk patient. So this shit is okay but I could not see my family because they could be asymptomatic carriers? 
You see the issue there?</p>
<p>Anyway, I would wish those commenters otherwise to go to hell but I'm better than them, so I will not stoop to their level. But eh, what do you expect from a community that has birthed MGTOW and incels. Psychopathic man-children the lot of them.</p>
