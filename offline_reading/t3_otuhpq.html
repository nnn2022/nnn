    <strong>By the logic of vaccinated get sick by unvaccinted we shouldve been all dead by now by various diseases</strong>
    <p><p>It seems like that the other 50% of people werent capable of thinking in the first place. 
They were forced by „group“ to do this.
It‘s like hanging out with people who consume drugs on a party, then youre the only one who doesnt want it, then youre afraid you will be abandoned or „uncool“ then take the drugs, too, and endup in a mess. And nobody cares what happens to you.</p>
<p>Or the need for social confirmation, inform of ‚likes‘ so they can feed their ego. „post heyyyyy im vaccinated“</p>
<p>Or not caring about anything, they just want their rights back as soon as possible because its makes them feel vulnerable for staying away from the life they are so used to. and so cannot deal with that.</p>
<p>I mean how many people are not vaccinated against ordinary diseases. 
We were travelling, made business, tourism, met all kinds of people. And most of us didnt get sick. </p>
<p>By wearing masks all the time, we are restricted from airflow. 
This sounds stupid, but since bill gates likes to eliminate co2 during his lifetime, why wouldnt he think of a glorious mask idea:
„if they keep co2 in their mask, and they keep on breathing it back in, we can reduce co2 that way!“</p>
<p>I know, very stupid. But who knows?
Apart from that I know the brain is dying with having a mask on all the time. And if you dont switch masks during the day, you breathe dead bacteria and get pneumonia. 
Super healthy!</p>
<p>Now they talk about how vaccinated are spreaders. Shouldnt be that way.
That means they got injected with something to cause them getting sick. 
And this could result into a pingpong effect.
Passing on the disease to eachother of the vaccinated until the immunesystem gives up and they die. </p>
<p>This is were again bill gates said: „oh the next pandemic will get the attention.“</p></p>
