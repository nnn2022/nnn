    <strong>Image a false pandemic that would allow them to release another virus that would go unchecked to secure a global mandated vaccination program that will ultimately give them absolute control.</strong>
    <p><p>After months and months of research into virology, it is quite evident that COVID has defied all the natural laws of a Virus. They simply don't work like this.</p>
<p>So lets imagine. Imagine releasing a virus upon the population that it is no more deadly than the seasonal flu virus, but carries an exceptionally high infection rate and is a relative of the already existing coronavirus's associated with colds. Imagine that this Virus had been engineered to demonstrate "novel" characteristics which really only serve to increase the rate of infection.</p>
<p>Then to ensure that the Pandemic takes hold, imagine them instilling fear into the people through killing thousands of vulnerable people by infecting nursing homes and hospitals with it, also causing so much chaos and confusion that even more people are killed through the misuse of ventilators, compounded by changing policies and creating mandates on how to rule Causes of death.</p>
<p>To ensure the spread imagine that they kill a Black man to incite mass global protests, followed by several additional killings leading to protests to keep the virus circulating. Throughout this imagine that they publicly state masks do not work, which they don't, they will slightly stall the spread, but that's not what they want, they want to get that virus everywhere as fast as they can. Imagine now that they retract their former claims and impose mask and isolation mandates to "protect" the people, which stirs up more protests, and with masks having minimal impact the spread keeps flourishing. The   controversial election was another perfect venue to secure the spread, Biden celebrators, and Trump protestors in the streets crammed together. </p>
<p>Once more let's imagine that throughout he course of this pandemic they initiated a mass testing campaign, using a testing technique that was never designed to be a diagnostic tool and is known to be highly flawed when used improperly, as a failsafe to secure mass positive results in the event that some people still have resisted or not contracted it. As long as they have contracted any coronavirus in their past the test is likely to be positive. </p>
<p>Now imagine that once they have gotten the world to focus on an otherward benign virus as a pandemic, they launch a secondary more virulent virus that has has a slower infection rate but is more lethal (trying to mimic the Spanish Flu). This virus would go unchecked becasue COVID is the only virus people are focusing on, from scientists, health professionals and the public at large, and anyone who dies will be tested positive for COVID becasue everyone either has it or has a relative of it in their systems, and since COVID has "proven" to kill people, who will look any further?</p>
<p>And  imagine all this is to achieve a global demand, acceptance and compliance for a vaccine that contains "elements" that will endow them with absolute control over us becasue just imagine that these "elements" will actually work to neutralize our immune systems so that they can administer additional elements which we will  will grant them control over our biological and mental functions. </p>
<p>Finally, imagine that all this can be accomplished without anyone being the wiser and only would require a handful of people to make this happen.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Just something to Imagine.</p></p>

        <p>Thatâ€™s scary AF. But plausible. My scenario: I like to imagine all the nefarious nasty beings behind this diabolical plan shrivelling up and dying a thousand deaths. The light pulses across our great lands in one fell swoop. A healing frequency is sent throughout. All darkness is gone. All sickness is healed. All misery is stopped. All mankind unites under their own sovereignty. All is love. </p>

        <p>Plausible for sure. I imagine the trajectory to be something along these lines in addition to some catastrophic event that will really propel their plan along.</p>

<p>I understand the proverb, but the truth is sometimes it takes a monster to defeat a monster. The trick is, once the battle is won, the monster must realize and accept it is a monster, and retreat to it's cage until called to do battle once again.</p>

        <p>Haha nice quote. Jordan Peterson said something similar and it really stuck with me. Those that are not fully aware of the monster within are the most susceptible to it's manifestations as they do not recognize it for what it is.</p>

        <p>That's where this is going, they were able to make people believe this exists and follow everything through fear alone and it sets the stage for just about anything else to be sent down the line for any agenda regarding mass control of society. The goal is obviously some kind of turning earth into a giant smart farm kind of thing whatever is specifically trying to be done. If they wanted to kill us all, it would be extremely easy but that's also not happening even though many lives have been lost to this. Of course there's a lot of other things that can happen to but either way it isn't looking good judging by how this was handled by people. The vaccines are already poison, what could be in this one that they need to rush out and push this hard?</p>

        <p>I think this Vaccine is like a precursor for the next. Similar to how when people receive transplants to successfully take, the immune system must be suppressed to prevent rejection of the new organ. This vaccine i believe serves a similar purpose, suppress our immune systems so they can implant other devices deep into our systems where our immune systems would attack it, such as nanobots.</p>

        <p>Yeah the only step after that is implanted technology that replaces or integrates with our organs and of course it'll be carried as some immortality thing when though it may extend life you give both your body and soul to the government and there will no longer be free will as they will have eyes on and control over everything. Remember they wouldn't be giving anyone something so great if it didn't benefit them a lot more, this will be rigged technology.</p>

        <p>lol well for one, it wouldn't require the need to falsify data, falsely inflate the data and sabotage the vulnerable while throwing the world into a panic.</p>
<p>IN reality, the first order of business would be to secure the vulnerable, not kill them, assess the threat on the healthy population, and if there is minimal risk to them, then let the virus circulate through them until it is weakened through mutation. This was a circus act, nothing more...A real pandemic cannot be stopped unless everyone has little airtight bubbles that our completely self contained and even then once they step outside again, guess what the virus will come back...You can't avoid it, you can't stop it..All you can do is take measures to protect those most at risk...</p>

        <p>The symptoms of all these viruses are the same...flu like symptoms with respiratory distress...And no...You don't discover a virus unless your looking for it.. That's why tests are virus specific..You don't find AIDS or Polio while testing for COVID or any other virus.</p>

        <p>What Iâ€™m saying is once other symptoms from the Spanish flu would start to pop up people would come in saying that they have also been experiencing that. Scientists check for things like mutations and once they donâ€™t find mutations they do other things and the virus is found.</p>

        <p>What other symptoms? They have been saying COVID causes just about everything and are even predicting long term effects which there is no possible science that can do that without a LONG term study..however, they are attributing all deaths to COVID if the COVID virus is found and that's exactly what there testing is providing..Positive covid results... so they aren't investigating any further, which is the current case.</p>

        <p>lol...No..they move forward with their plans with a society full of compliant rats at their dispose. IT's pretty simple, they revere themselves as Gods, however they need eternal life for that, which they will be seeking throughout there sick science. If we saw people living to 200 years or more, we might be a little suspicious, but in the new future, where history is currently being rewritten, it will be the norm to see those in power to live for multiple generations...becasue they are the chosen ones lol</p>
