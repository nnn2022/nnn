        <p>Okay but this strand of coronavirus is new and researchers don't know a lot about it. After just a year, people have reported long lasting symptoms such as cognitive dysfunction, loss of senses, and chronic respiratory illness. Some people who have contracted covid 19 and survived are still dealing with groups of symptoms that are thought to have been caused by covid19, and it's possible that covid19, like chickenpox, can have complications later on in life after contracting it once. </p>
<p>I'm glad you would take an Ebola outbreak more seriously, since the symptoms of Ebola are a lot more obvious and gruesome, and yes, more deadly. Except you can't say for sure what the effects of covid19 are because even the experts don't know yet, since it's a relatively new coronavirus, so you shouldn't dismiss Covid19 as a serious disease and ignorantly infect other people just because you don't think there will be any long term side effects. Also, the more people who catch it, the more likely it is that higher risk individuals will catch it, and the harder it will be for them to perform necessary tasks and interact with people without catching the virus and potentially dying. </p>
<p>We just need to do what we should have done way early on and just sit still until the few people who had covid quarantined and were then cleared. And now that they're offering a vaccine, we could literally be back to normal life in a couple months if we all got vaccinated. I'm personally not trying to force or coerce anyone to take the vaccine, as it seems to be the top reason not to get vaccinated ("i'd rather die for my right to choose than be forced to take a vaccine") and I totally agree with that. My mentality is simple: I want to get back to the way things were, you probably want to get back to the way things were, we all want to get back to the way things were... the easiest way to do that and be safe from Covid19 is to get vaccinated... so let's get vaccinated.</p>

        <p>I guess I‚Äôm just living on the edge because I still care about being pissed on than breathed on. As for going back to normal. We didn‚Äôt need to change anything the first time around. We could have flattened the curve perhaps (which we did) and allowed for natural herd immunity. People were always going to die from this. There was no way of stopping it. Vaccine wise, once they are available to anybody that wants it than there is no excuse for any restrictions. It doesn‚Äôt matter how many get it but if everyone has access to it. That puts the risk back in our hands. It‚Äôll protect people like you from monsters like me.</p>

        <p>I don't know about you, but I don't want to be like all the other boomers who sent their kids to go catch chicken pox and develop a herd immunity to it, cuz all them mfs have shingles now. It's a virus, inherently unpredictable, and because of how new this strain is, has not been thoroughly researched. I don't want to catch it, even if I survive it. That said, if I catch it and I know I have it, I'll willingly be homeless for like 3 weeks til that shit is gone because I live with my parents and am around old people all the time. </p>
<p>We changed things the first time around because of how infectious coronaviruses are, and because Covid19 was a novel coronavirus at the time, experts (and thus, the general public) did not know how deadly the virus was going to be. I'm probably as apathetic as you are about people all over the globe. I honestly don't care how many people have covid or how many people die from it. People die, it happens, and I'm not a stranger to that fact. The problem lies with potentially wiping out an entire generation of people, and how that might effect us politcally, socially, and economically. Honestly, being aware of the effects of a disease and doing nothing to stop the spread of it can be categorized as a form of genocide, which has been the documented word for what happened to native americans and africans during imperial times. More generally, doing nothing to stop the death of upwards of millions of people can also be categorized more broadly as genocide rather than a form of it. </p>
<p>I really don't care one way or the other about the ethics of it, that's up to the history books of the future to decide. What I care about is me, and making it harder to stay healthy and not catch this virus is my problem with the anti-mask and anti-vaccine community that developed as a form of anti-establishment. Frankly, it's not based off of any science, and is just a large group of adults saying "you can't tell me what to do" like children.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to fearmonger obviously, and I don't think you're a monster. Please stop putting words in my mouth and have a decent conversation with me. The more open you, and other people in this community, are with opposing viewpoints, as I am with yours, then the more discussion we can have about these issues and hopefully the more change we can effect soon and get shit back to normal.</p>

        <p>To your first point, about willing to be homeless for 3 weeks in order to keep your parents and older people safe? Well that certainly seems like a personal responsibility. You see, I don‚Äôt live with my parents, nor do I regularly interact with old people. So why should I have to take the same precautions as you? I‚Äôm not willing to be homeless if I get it. As for the economic impact? At least in America, we have a crisis when it comes to things like healthcare and social security. Do you know why? Because the largest generation in history (the shingles promoting boomers you were talking about) are now collecting their social security and using Medicare. If a large portion of that generation were to be taken out by a disease, than the future of those programs would be a lot better. See? I‚Äôm not putting words in your mouth. I really am a monster.</p>

        <p>You make it really hard to talk with you by being a self proclaimed MoNsTeR. Lol no, you're just like me and like I said I really don't give a shit if we snub out a whole generation. What I'm looking at in terms of consequences are economic, political and social. The economy might benefit from relieving us from the healthcare-needy older people, but not from the fuckton of overweight healthcare-needy people with heart problems, breathing problems, and other reasons they're going to die soon. Yes, the one of the largest living adult generations might be significantly downsized by just letting loose, and thus reduce some spending on public healthcare (although keep in mind a good amount of retired americans stay with healthcare within the marketplace). Politically, however, america may sway very quickly and radically in a new direction. Does this mean we might quickly develop into a more socialist nation? A fascist nation? Dunno about all that, but it has happened in the past in other countries where generations have died at higher rates. It's something to consider. Socio-economically? A lot of older folk work in education, healthcare, airlines, and other trades. We are already in high demand for commercial airline pilots, doctors, school teachers, college professors, and even truckers and other blue collar work (some in higher demand than others). If a group of people are all becoming hospitalized and/or dying very quickly, that demand for workers goes higher, which means the reliability and quality of the services they used to work for goes lower. Travel may become more expensive to pay for a shortage of staff needing to take on more responsibilities or for more resources, general prices of goods may go up due to a lack of interstate transportation, etc. A lot of this is more big picture than you might first think, and the more you look at it that way you might see how it might indirectly affect you. </p>
<p>Since I'm on a cooldown now apparently from having a lot of discussion with people, I'll respond to your other comment where you say pushing people into poverty can be seen as a form of genocide. Your first link guides to a concern for famine in poor communities such as those in Bangladesh, Sudan, Niger, Afghanistan, and Venezuela. These are all areas who have been struggling with a food shortage for as many as 4 to 11 years to even four decades before the pandemic. Honestly, food shortages outside the United States are not really a big concern to me, especially since they've been going on for the past few decades. In these areas, it's either dying of hunger, or dying of a lack of medical resources in a pandemic. A lot of Americans are lucky because they catch covid and snuff it off due to our relatively advanced field of medicine which other communities around the world may not have. While most cases of covid19 are either asymptomatic or mild, 1) the long-term effects have not been studied and 2) another huge chunk of covid19 cases are moderate to deadly, ranging from crippling flu-like symptoms to acute respiratory failures. Imagine how bad those effects would be in a third world country, struggling with a food shortage, in a pandemic with no regard for public health safety. It's a lose lose situation, and it's not anyone's fault but their hesitance to lockdown their country before Covid19 got to their communities. Early action would have probably stopped all this from happening, but now that it's happened, they have two problems to deal with at once and it's their own fault.</p>
<p>Your other two sources pretty much cite the same communities, and I can't find a first-world country that is suffering to a food shortage due specifically to covid19 besides company related policies keeping workers and customers safe, which have not affected anyone acutely within the United States. The only recent food and water shortages that have happened were in Texas and Oregon where a large ice storm knocked out power for a vast array of people. This was not a covid19 related incident, but it was harder to recover from due to the restrictions in place for covid19 and public safety (though you won't find texans really following those restrictions... kind of explains their high infection rates.) </p>
<p>The difference between what I said and what you brought up is subtle, but it's there: Knowing the effects of a potentially deadly virus and negligently infecting other people with it is a far greater threat and more closely rides the definition of genocide than a food crisis being even more negatively affected by a covid19 pandemic. Whereas the former is a group of people ignoring a single problem despite a solution rapidly approaching, the latter is an entire community ravaged by two devastating crises at once with little access to a vaccine. They have to choose between hunger or public safety, and it looks like if they're going to blame covid19 for an increase in famine, then they've chosen public safety. But choosing to fight one problem that simultaneously happens to worsen another problem is just bad luck and a tough circumstance, not genocide.</p>

        <p>You're under the impression that covid is such a magical virus that "we know nothing about", while at the same time "listen to the experts and the science!". As if this virus wasn't a respiratory virus, a mild coronavirus...hardly anything enigmatic.</p>
<p>The percentage of people at actually high risk of complications from this virus is extremely small...otherwise it would have a much higher IFR and a sizeable proportion of the deaths would be young people.</p>
<p>You're also missing the point that normality shouldn't have been taken hostage first of all (especially not over an extremely low IFR virus that didn't warrant any of the draconian measures). I will not take the vaccine, because that sets a dangerous precedent that they can take our freedom for one year and then "generously" give it back as long as we take the vaccine like good little boys and girls.</p>
<p>This is exactly like a horribly abusive spouse who takes everything from you, including your self-worth and dignity, then makes you feel relief when they "allow" you something that was just your basic right. "Thanks for letting me go out with you for 20 minutes to get a hamburger tonight...I know it could be worse, you could not allow me to leave the house or talk to anyone for months while beating me up every night and starving me".</p>
<p>And your long term effect argument is irrelevant. Healthy people can also get permanent heart and lung damage from the flu, common cold, and even stomach flus. Surely you knew that. But those are acceptable risks and we don‚Äôt wear masks or shut everything down every time one of those bugs is going around.</p>

        <p>&rt;You're under the impression that covid is some magical alien supervirus that "we know nothing about"</p>
<p>I never said experts don't know anything about it. In fact, when Covid19 was first identified, there was already a wealth of information on it, such as the MERS-CoV outbreak in 2012 and the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak in 2002. However, simply having a baseline understanding of a coronavirus is not enough to just give up and have at it. For over a year, medical experts have been looking into the symptoms, virology, epidemiology, and prognosis and prevention for Covid19 to not only better understand the virus, but to help find a way to quickly contain the virus. Keep in mind, Coronaviruses are mainly hosted to animals, with about 15% of Coronaviruses responsible for common cold infections <a href="doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.45134">(1)</a>. The article just mentioned also goes over what the medical community has learned about Covid19 since March 15, 2020. This is a really small amount of time and it covers a lot of information. </p>
<p>To reiterate, we don't "know nothing" about this strand of SARS-CoV, but we also don't know everything. For only having been out for about a year, we still don't know any long term effects (which isn't to say there are any, but <a href="https://doi.org/10.5455/JPMA.32">it seems there could be based on what we know about SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV</a>.) These include long term cardiorespiratory, pulmonary, endocrinological, neruopsychiatric, and glucometabolic complications. I encourage you to read up more on this not out of fearmongering, but just to show you that the medical community (and thus the public) doesn't know exactly what we're dealing with other than only a decade of relevant research.</p>
<p>&rt;IFR</p>
<p>Alright, now let's talk about Infection Fatality Rate, which I'm assuming is what you mean here (took me a fat minute to realize you weren't talking about aviation lol cuz I've never heard of such a fancy acronym lik this). Yes, according to 534k deaths and 29.5m in the united states 21.4% (69.56m people over the age of 57) has a total IFR of about 1.81%. This seems really low statistically, and I agree that it is. This does not account for non-fatalities, though, including long-term complications of survivors, which has not been documented yet from what I've researched. If we put this into numbers instead of percents, 1.81% of 69.56m is 1,259,036 people, which is more people than that have died to cancer last year <a href="https://www.cancer.org/research/cancer-facts-statistics/all-cancer-facts-figures/cancer-facts-figures-2020.html">(606,520)</a>. We're in 2021, by the way.  Yes, it's a low number relative to the population of the united states, but by saying "the actual number of people at risk of dying to complications is extremely small" is a little misleading, given that only half of that number died to a much more prevalent disease with a higher IFR (which also tends to kill you if you don't get it treated 100% of the time :thonk:). </p>
<p>Normality hasn't been taken hostage. Limits on people in a store and a mask mandate is not restricting your ability to go anywhere. In fact, I would argue this is one of the most lenient covid19 prevention practices worldwide. I also know that gathering in large groups is not illegal (see Capitol Riot of Jan 2021, Portland riots circa May 2020, covid19 parties, etc) in most areas of the country, and this is off the top of my head. Yes, businesses could get fined for having too many people in one spot, but I don't see that affecting you directly. </p>
<p>&rt;dangerous precedent</p>
<p>Hm, like this hasn't happened already? You can't enroll a child into most public school systems without current vaccinations on record, to start. Also, the likelyhood that anyone is going to require vaccine proof for you doing anything you could normally do pre 2020 (ie the freedoms you could still enjoy now combined with things you could do before) is very low. If there's anything you and I could agree with though, I would say it's this issue here. I don't want anyone having control over anyone else's life based on HIPAA protected medical information, and vaccines are covered under this. Except that children require it for public schools, but we're already so used to this that we don't think about it. Also if this is your only reason for not getting the vaccine, you might want to really read that last sentence again... we already do this.</p>
<p>&rt;makes you feel relief when they "allow" you something that was just your basic right</p>
<p>And what's a basic right you don't have anymore that was given to you constitutionally? What can you now get arrested and imprisoned for doing now that you could do back in 2019? Keep in mind private businesses are not government entities, even if they're being mandated by government entities. This means that a store requiring sub 100 people in their establishment because they were mandated to by the state means that <em>they</em> get in trouble for not following this, not you. The worst they can do is kick you out or trespass you.</p>
<p>&rt;"94% of those over 80 will not die if they contract covid. Many will not even have symptoms at all."</p>
<p>This needs a citation. I'd like to see more information on this. A lot of stuff in this paragraph seems like it needs a source, such as people in their 60s not being more at risk than if they were to catch the flu, average 60+ year olds not having more than mild or moderate symptoms, etc. Because it seems to me that if we apply the IFR solely to boomers (which is both a stretch and misinforming), then over 21% of boomers have died due to this virus. That doesn't seem to match the IFR I got from a simple google search. </p>
<p>&rt;"Mortality rate of covid does not exceed the mortality rate of just being that age"</p>
<p>Another citation needed, but I went ahead and <a href="10.1001/archinte.166.14.1505">found a source that says you're making that up.</a> (<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/410689">full text</a>). <a href="doi.org/10.1001/jama.2020.1585">Here's another source suggesting that age demonstrates a patient's prognosis</a>. Tl;Dr, patients requiring intensive care were a median age of 66, meaning despite outlier young people dying from this virus, we're still seeing that age is a huge factor in fatality. To compare, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6474463/">the median age for strep infections is 2 years old</a> and <a href="https://www.who.int/immunization/newsroom/press/news_group_b_strep_stillbirths_infant_deaths_2017/en/">about 147k infants die because of it</a> globally. With all the adult strep infections worldwide, median age is still 2 years old.</p>
<p>&rt;People who are "vulnerable" to covid, are also vulnerable to other causes of natural death that no one ever claimed to want to protect them from</p>
<p>And people with AIDS are vulnerable to other causes of natural death too lol. They're just a lot more likely to die due to a common infection most of us show no symptoms for. The point is that yes, old people eventually die. They'll die faster with covid in a big chunk of cases.</p>
<p>&rt;Healthy people can also get permanent heart and lung damage from the flu, common cold, and stomach flus</p>
<p>Sure. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.otoeng.2013.10.004">Here's an article discussing chronic olfactory disorders in a study based on 240 patients</a>, and <a href="doi.org/10.4103/0970-2113.99118">here is a case report</a> discussing the condition arising from a 29 year old woman who recovered from the swine flu. What makes covid19 any different, especially with two examples of similar aggressive viruses such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 who have documented sequelae uncovered in just a decade of research? My point, aggressive corona virus sequelae &rt; slightly documented flu sequelae. (by the way, both these articles I believe are talking specifically about the H1N1 flu, not any other type of flu. I really looked, but I couldn't find any significant article discussing a major condition arising from any type of flu. <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/370426">There was even an article published</a> that examined the Guillain-Barre syndrome arising from the H1N1 vaccine, which is an inflammatory neuritis that affected 500 people out of 40 million americans who were vaccinated. In other words, negligible but an interesting topic. But this is from a vaccine, not from the flu itself.</p>
<p>^^^ Also this is why we get vaccinated so we don't have to deal with potentially dying from the flu every year. ^^^. It's actually the reason we don't have to wear masks to stop the spread of the flu. It's not because it's considered an "acceptable risk," it's because it's normal to vaccinate against the flu so if we catch it, it doesn't present such crippling sickness. And due to the lack of sustainable research that would claim that there are common long term conditions that arise from the flu, we don't really care if we catch it.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm probably gonna have to wait another 15 minutes to respond to the rest of my inbox. Maybe use that time to fact check me or educate yourself. I also encourage you to do your own research!</p>

        <p>Almost literally nothing. Again, it comes to personal responsibility and common sense. Don‚Äôt put sick people into nursing homes. If you have underlying health issues, take extra precautions. I got married in September and a family friend didn‚Äôt come because she was worried she might get sick. No hard feelings. We certainly missed her but I still had a 100+ guest indoor wedding with no illness. If you feel sick, don‚Äôt go to work. Same as it always is. The problem I have with this whole thing is that it is the healthy people that are punished.</p>

        <p>So, don't put recovering patients in their nursing homes because the nursing homes were unable to properly protect the other residents, but otherwise just let people get sick and die?  And everyone would just ignore the sickness and death and keep working and spending money and distracting themselves?  </p>
<p>Don't say that we could have kept the vulnerable safe if you don't mean it.  What you mean is let them die, because you believe you and anyone you actually care about would have been fine.    </p>
<p>I know you won't believe it, but the reason there were "only" 500,000 excess total deaths in the U.S. in 2020 and the reason you were able to hold a large indoor wedding and be lucky enough to not spread the virus (unlike the weddings that led to huge outbreaks), was that many many other people were making different choices.  All the people social distancing and wearing masks -- often voluntarily -- reduced the spread of the virus.   My family didn't have a funeral for the relative who died of Covid, because every member of my large extended family respected the virus, even before a family member died.  His exposure, by the way, was despite being as careful as possible, but sometimes luck is not on your side and one person who was careless crosses your path at the wrong time. But my parents made it through without getting the virus and are vaccinated, so I am thankful for the efforts many members of our community made, especially the sacrifices over the holidays.</p>

        <p>Yes. Don‚Äôt put dying, infectious people into a nursing home. They‚Äôre most likely going to die. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to have them take others with them.

        <p>That, or you know universal health care, or  just give people stimulus checks  consistently during the lockdown so they don't have to work, like pretty much every other country did. Unfortunately the US government pretty much dropped the ball on this. That also doesn't distract from the fact that hospital bills are ridiculous. So don't claim you care about people's economic well being, when you clearly don't.</p>

        <p>It comes from taxes, like everything else. We would also have more tax money if they wealthy paid their share and businesses actually paid their taxes. Yes nearly 1/2 million dead in the year is the government dropping the ball, especially when this would have been easily avoided. There is way more to it than stimulus, if they did everything else right the stimulus wouldn't have mattered as much.</p>

        <p>An economic study was done about 5 years ago. That economic study came to the conclusion that if the wealthy 1% were to be taxed 100%. All of it, every single cent, it would only fund Medicare for 3 years. One social program that is only available primarily to people 65 and older. Taxing the rich into oblivion isn‚Äôt the answer because, if you do that, than the jobs they create won‚Äôt be sustainable and it still wouldn‚Äôt give you what you want.

        <p>Cool story bro, I never said that, there is a difference between where they are taxed now, paying more, and then "being taxed into oblivion". Also you want people to take responsibility for themselves, yet are literally defending the people who aren't paying their fair share, or are not taking "personal responsibility" on their taxes. I agree we should cut wasteful spending, like reversing of the tax breaks the rich and companies get.</p>

        <p>Have you actually looked at the numbers, or any evidence actually? You are saying that we can't afford the less than 200$ billion difference between the current health care spending and the universal Healthcare plans. What are saying makes no sense if you actually look at the numbers. </p>
<p>I think some rich people literally made that much just during the pandemic, Universal health care isn't that expensive compared to the broken system we currently have. Even if somehow raising the tax on the rich doesn't increase revenue, there are other ways ways do so. Stop being so defeatist unless you actually have a good alternative.</p>

        <p>‚ÄúThere are other ways to to do so.‚Äù Yes, like having the tax structure of a country like Denmark. They‚Äôve got all the social programs you could dream of. They also get taxed at 90%. On top of that, everyday goods are extremely expensive thanks to the import tariffs that the government has imposed on their companies. That‚Äôs why every time my cousins come to the states they bring empty suitcases. So they can take back things like dress shirts, jeans, and underwear that are triple the price back home. I don‚Äôt want to live like that. I‚Äôd rather have a say in where my money goes.

There would be no need for insurance. Prices would fall because doctors would have less ‚Äúcustomers.‚Äù They‚Äôd have to make it affordable to people. Instead, those of us that work hard and put significant portions of our paychecks into healthcare insurance are the ones that have to pay for the ones that don‚Äôt. Well I‚Äôm sorry to say (not really) that I don‚Äôt care about them. I‚Äôm a callous, cold-hearted son of a bitch. I want to fix the system, but it sure doesn‚Äôt involve paying more for other people. And the whole ‚Äúlet‚Äôs just tax the rich!‚Äù argument is no good because what happens when they say ‚Äúfuck it, I‚Äôm leaving the country!‚Äù? What happens when a guy like Jeff Bezos says ‚Äúyou know what? I‚Äôve made enough money, I‚Äôm going to shut down Amazon and lay off over half a million employees.‚Äù The rich are always going to find a way to keep their money. Finally, the U.S. government is the LAST entity that I would trust with healthcare. Our school system sucks, or infrastructure is crumbling, we can‚Äôt secure our borders, Amtrak has never turned a profit, social security is headed for bankruptcy and the VA (government run healthcare) is abysmal. All while being in astronomical debt! With the exception of National defense, I can‚Äôt think of a single thing the U.S. government haven‚Äôt fucked up. With that kind of track record, what makes you think that this time around will be any different at all?</p>

        <p>Well you don't have any alternative, so you are arguing for the status quo which we both know sucks. And yes Healthcare is a right, in literally every civilized country they can do it, why can't America? Also what is to stop Jeff Bezos from doing that now? Literally nothing. Solve that problem first then you can try the others.</p>

        <p>Bezos isn‚Äôt being taxed 80,85,90%. And no, it‚Äôs not a right. It relies on people to perform it on you. What if no doctor would perform surgery on you?

        <p>Using that line of logic food isn't a right, since it's a service that's provided, since we can't force people to produce, farm, cook or prepare it. Logically we can look at countries that already do that and we can see how behind America is in comparison. And the only one who's suggested taxing that much is you, it's a ludicrous idea that's just another red herring. I wonder if you can avoid making those.</p>

<p>Tbh I never heard that term before, but why is someone disagreeing with you a radial far left Marxist (I think thats what you mean)? </p>
<p>What I mean is that the goal of every person should be to better their community, or the overall goal. I don't mean anything radical by that just that people should try to better society as a whole instead of solely focusing on themselves. Unless that is somehow a radical concept now.</p>

        <p>That is a philosophy that I don't subscribe to and is not how societies thrive.  So we really have no personal responsibility for the consequences of our actions as they affect others and no one needs to try to look out for each other in a crisis?   I mean, I think we in the U.S. failed to look out for people economically, but that is a separate issue. I read a theory that people with your perspective often haven't really experienced people caring about them, even when they were children, and if that's true I am sorry.  </p>
<p>Who are the people sitting down in the highway?  The people who dare to be over 65 or be immune compromised?  If you did see someone sitting in the highway, you DO have a moral obligation to avoid running them over.  You can't just shrug, say it's their fault, and hit them because it'll be quicker and do less damage to your car than trying to avoid them.</p>

        <p>I get it, but I think this is why I think the n95 mask shortage is the real issue here.</p>
<p>The surgical masks were never supposed to protect us - but instead of asking why we still have a n95 shortage an entire year later, people are arguing about mask mandates. Yes, they are acting out of fear - because they know that they they're being denied the equipment to properly protect themselves.  I think that if people felt they could actually protect themselves with PPE that works they wouldn't feel the need to have lockdowns and mask mandates to compensate. </p>
<p>And while I don't think the coronavirus was a bioweapon (it's not deadly enough, for starters) I do worry that the next pandemic might be. I think this whole fiasco has shown how completely ill-prepared we would be if China or some other hostile actor were to use a bioweapon against us.</p>

<p>The article itself practically accuses the story of being fraudulent, and the links are dead. But even assuming it's not, the article says</p>
<p>&rt;"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend wearing face coverings while driving, especially, if you're alone in the car."</p>
<p>So what is this supposed to prove?</p>
<p>&rt;https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8283965/Two-Chinese-boys-drop-dead-run-PE-lessons-wearing-face-masks.html</p>
<p>Turns out the first death could have been a heart condition instead and they don't even know if the 2nd one was even wearing a mask. </p>
<p>So the possibility that n95s caused a mere 3 deaths somehow prove n95s aren't safe?</p>
<p>&rt;What people really need is vitamin D. The modern world is chronically deficient then wonders why a weak virus hits them so hard.</p>
<p>That's a bit hyperbolic, don't you think? Your own sources say stuff like this:</p>
<p>&rt;&rt;Meltzer told Healthline that he ranked getting adequate vitamin D in the diet ‚Äúbelow masks and hygiene‚Äù in terms of COVID-19 prevention</p>
<p>Like, yes, vitamin D deficiencies increase your risk, but not by that much.</p>

<p>And, no, vitamin D is huge for all diseases. The flu season is very likely a result of less vitamin D during the Fall/Winter months.  Covid overlaps the flu season, so, no, Vitamin D is huge.</p>

        <p>No, when you breathe out, you breathe out a mixture of gas and liquid particles. The gas particles include things like carbon dioxide and other byproducts of the oxygen/nitrogen you breathe in. The liquid particles include any loose moisture and aerosol particles from your respiratory tract, quickly condensed water vapor as soon as it leaves your warm insides, and sometimes, yes, little particles of saliva. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm.164.5.2101032">Feel free to read about it here</a>. Don't try to strawman what I'm saying like Cathy Newman, you're better than that. Please make a good-faith effort to understand my viewpoint and what I'm saying.</p>
<p>There are other ways you can get sick than getting spit on (which can get you sick). Inhaling respiratory droplets carrying the covid19 virus, and touching a surface with covid19 droplets then touching your face or any open cut being the primary two other ways of getting sick (since this is a respiratory disease spread through respiratory particles and bloodstream). I can provide more primary sources on this information, but most of it has already been reported in the mainstream news as secondary, laymanized information that I don't really think it'll take more than a google search to validate. Let me know if I should provide, though, and I'll be more than happy to.</p>

        <p>Sounds like a tax on being too simple-minded. I have five cloth masks that I store in a bag. Bring it with me everywhere that I think I'm going to be in a mask for more than an hour at a time, and every hour I switch masks. Every time I come home, I wash all my used masks. It's not hard and it doesn't cost me a dime.</p>

        <p>Gas and aerosol are not the same thing. Maybe they were downvoting you because your analogy is comparing two different things. Experiment: let someone fart in your face with pants on and then let someone fart in your face without pants, one mine carry more substances. :s</p>

        <p>Methane is one of the main compounds of a fart... which is a gas..
Where do you think the term passing gas came from? 
Aerosol is a liquid mixed into pressurized air...

        <p>Yes you‚Äôre right, I‚Äôm saying gas isn‚Äôt always the only thing coming out of farts. Aerosol is solids/liquid droplets that travel in the air: fog, dust, maybe fart juices lol. That‚Äôs why a mask can be helpful, for when you cough aerosolized particles into the air, a proper mask can help catch it.</p>

        <p>Because of what you said, that‚Äôs their reasoning at least. But saliva is the most unlikely scenario of getting COVID. Theres other experts saying that unless it‚Äôs an m95 it‚Äôs like a mosquito flying through a chain link fence... 
I watched a video of a dude vaping and exhales through his mask. It travels right through... sure some is slowed down but it just goes out the sides and tops... 
Just look around, I‚Äôve seen pretty much everyone wearing a mask, I‚Äôll see maybe 2-4 people a week not wearing one... for the most part everyone is wearing a mask. If they worked we would know by now. </p>
<p>This entire thing is just ludicrous, go and order a burrito at chipotle and wear a mask, only to take it off 30 seconds later to eat right next to everyone in line is ok. 
Having 200 people in the aisles of Walmart fighting over toilet paper is ok, but having 5-10 people in a small business at the same time isn‚Äôt. 
We were told steroids to help the lungs don‚Äôt work by fauchi, turns out that‚Äôs the number 1 thing to help when put on ventilators... 
Michigan banned buying seeds last summer.
Michigan and New York flooded old folks homes with sick patients, while blaming the spread on trump..
Cuomo lied about how many people died to COVID to save face... while trashing trump the entire time. Meanwhile small businesses get shutdown, people lose their jobs, they can‚Äôt feed their families, will never be able to re open their businesses. While Amazon Walmart and all the other big ones rake in all the cash the small businesses are no longer allowed to earn.
COVID-19 might be the actual virus floating around but it was definitely spread on purpose. Call me a nut job but I don‚Äôt care anymore... none of this makes sense, it hasn‚Äôt from day one. But everyone is scared shitless from a virus with a 98% survival rate and too worried to notice that it‚Äôs all nonsense..</p>

        <p>Which is why we should study the physics of gas and how our masks help prevent the spread of disease. In fact, covid-19 is spread through droplets of respiratory fluid that is constantly released from breathing, talking, coughing, etc. For anyone that wears glasses, you might notice that any quick attempt to clean glasses by breathing on them to wipe them off results in a foggy layer on the glasses. This fogginess is the result of respiratory droplets covering the glasses and making its surface moist. </p>
<p>With that said, when you have a mask designed to catch those respiratory droplets and stop them from spreading as far, you can actually lower the chance of infecting other people with covid-19 even if you don't think you have it. When two people wear a mask and stand a reasonable distance apart, it can take as long as 15 to 30 minutes before anybody could contract Covid19, which is why the more barriers between human interaction the better.</p>
<p>Coming from a Cybersecurity major, by the way. None of this information took very long to google, and it's all backed by science we've been taught since 2010. This is basic high school biology.</p>

        <p>Buddy.... all of this is good and true for m95s
Not those blue surgical masks or gator or whatever. 
Someone can take a vape pen... which is a perfect example of the moisture you‚Äôre speaking of... and it blows right fucking through the mask. The science since 2010 also tells us that those particulates are too small to not pass through the masks everyone‚Äôs wearing. Especially these pieces of cloth tied to you‚Äôre face... 
read the fucking packaging it straight up says in it does not help prevent the spread of infectious disease... 
sooooo mr cyber security genius.... you can read all the fucking articles you want. But none of this is true when it comes to the masks everyone‚Äôs been wearing...</p>

        <p>Okay, seriously read what I'm writing. You brought up exhaling glycerin and other shit from a vape pen and said that was a "perfect example" of the moisture and respiratory droplets I'm talking about... except that if you could see the respiratory droplets as purple, you would see the vape go through the mask but not any purple. This is because the respiratory droplets (the 'moisture' I was talking about, which is not to say moisture in general) are bigger than the aerosolized gas breathed out during vaping. N95s are more than capable of blocking these respiratory droplets, and this is a fact that hasn't changed just after March 2020. Doctors use it to protect blood from getting in their mouths, and also to stop spreading any bacteria from their own mouths into patients during open surgery.</p>
<p>&rt;Read the fucking packaging</p>
<p>I did, and you misquoted it, dude. It says, verbatim, "This product is not a respirator and will not provide any protection against covid-19(Coronavirus) or other viruses or contaminants." It does not say it doesn't help prevent the spread of such contaminants. Yes, you can still catch Covid19 even while wearing a mask, which is why everyone is trying to get everyone to wear their mask. If I'm wearing a mask, I can still catch covid19 from you; if we are both wearing masks, then both of us are catching our own respiratory droplets and are much less likely to catch it from each other. Again, this science hasn't changed since doctors started using them in surgeries to sterilize their environment. </p>
<p>Thanks, but I'm not a genius. If you don't know how to verify your sources by now (which you clearly don't), then you don't get to tell me about how shitty my sources are. Despite my education, I can read and understand a science journal and keep up on medicine lol.</p>

        <p>You understand you think you just won the argument by acknowledging that it doesn‚Äôt protect against COVID... idk why you‚Äôre even having this discussion after reading that... 
I‚Äôve said this entire time the 95s are the only ones worth a damn... and no the ‚Äúpurple‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt stay back unless it is an 95.... that‚Äôs my entire point. The masks were wearing don‚Äôt do shit. Those molecules are so small.. the basic blue mask you see it‚Äôs the same as a mosquito flying through a chain link fence... that‚Äôs backed by science my friend.. and common sense... like you do understand the bacteria were talking about has to be examined through a microscope right?.... 
you people are comical... you‚Äôre basically arguing someone has to spit on you in order to catch an airborne virus... it‚Äôs just not true. I think it‚Äôs awesome you‚Äôre willing to do research to back you‚Äôre argument.. I‚Äôll research something when I‚Äôm unsure of something but this is pretty freakin basic...</p>
<p>People like you are legitimately brainwashed into not thinking for yourself... 
people ask all the time how could the Holocaust have happened... because people like you refuse to actually use common sense instead of just repeating what comes from the media... because they‚Äôre the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù 
I feel sorry you all are so worried about a 98% chance to live</p>

        <p>They don't protect against covid. They prevent the spread of covid. I acknowledged this, I demonstrated that there's a difference. You're the one who's not understanding what I'm saying. The problem with you saying that this is basic and then giving the wrong answer is demonstrative of your inability to do research in the first place, which I'm the one doing to even get this information. But no, doing research is for covid sheep who don't know how to research.</p>
<p>Think of it this way. To breathe, you inhale the in front of your mask (some of it comes through the mask because it's not literally metal and because oxygen is smaller than small droplets of liquid). Some of the air you breathe also comes from the sides, top, and bottom of your mask meaning that if you're standing in a cloud of covid-infected respiratory droplets, you might end up breathing it in. The point is that the mask is supposed to help stop the dispersement of those droplets into farther distances, which is why standing 6 feet apart along with wearing a mask is supposed to lower the chances of getting sick. To reiterate, it helps lower the rate of infection by keeping exhaled particles localized instead of spread out, and because respiratory droplets are bigger than oxygen molecules, the mask stops the purple covid and you might see carbon dioxide and water vapor go through the mask. <strong>that was my point, and you missed it and called me an idiot.</strong></p>
<p>Some basic facts you got wrong:
-Covid19 is a virus, not a bacteria. It needs to be sheltered in a membrane of some kind, such as respiratory droplets, in order to survive longer and not break apart faster. This also means it's an amino acid, a non-living thing, and it's easier to break apart (or "kill") on surfaces than it is to kill bacteria because bacteria can grow resistant to anti-bacterial medicine and wipes.</p>
<p>-Comparing the size of respiratory droplets through N95 mask to a mosquito through a chain link fence. I wonder who told you that because that's not true. Again, these masks are used in surgeries to stop doctors from infecting patients with particles leaving their mouth that carries bacteria and viruses like the common cold, which could complicate surgery recovery.</p>
<p>-98% chance to live, yes, but the novel coronavirus also has shown long term, chronic symptoms post-infection as well such as cognitive dysfunction, respiratory problems, nausea, and some general pain. I don't want to deal with that, and I don't understand why it's so bad to want to stay healthy lol. You're acting like the same people who sent their kids to chickenpox parties, and now those kids grew up and have to deal with shingles. History is repeating itself because you're too ignorant of basic facts and you disregard others health concerns because you're so barely, slightly inconvenienced by the use of a mask.</p>
<p>Finally, you keep saying that I am saying you have to spit on people to infect them with covid? I've already denied that twice very clearly. It seems you don't understand how breathing works, so I'll <a href="https://doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm.164.5.2101032">link a very helpful article that examines exactly what is in an exhalation</a> that you can feel free to read at your leisure. Basically, when you inhale, your body brings in a bunch of shit like oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and other particulates in the air. Your lungs process this gas and release oxygen into the bloodstream to feed your brain and keep it alive. Simultaneously in a single inhale, carbon dioxide enters the lungs as a waste byproduct of used O2. During exhalation, this carbon dioxide, as well as water vapor and other small liquids from the lower respiratory tract exit the body through your mouth or nose.</p>
<p>Spitting on someone is accomplished by gathering an accumulation of saliva in your mouth, and then forcefully exhaling a short amount of air through small opening in your mouth to turn that saliva into a projectile.</p>
<p>Hopefully, after explaining the subtle difference between breathing and spitting, you might be open to hearing more of what I have to say than discounting me as a brainwashed, holocaust denying, no common-sense headass. Lol ffs for someone who says they have a basic understanding of the shit we're talking about, you seem to be getting a lot of things wrong. It might help to do that research you said you would do if you're unsure of something.</p>

        <p>You're giving up and not doing any research. I'm on this sub to keep an open mind and to call yall's bluff on the "reddit is a libtard cesspool" and clear up a potential hivemind from starting in this community. Everyone here is posting the same ideas all day, reinforcing a confirmation bias getting you guys thinking that you're right even though your points don't match up to the science you claim to know.</p>
<p>We're going back and forth because you don't address any of my points without strawmanning it. All you keep saying is that I'm saying you have to spit on people to infect them which is not what I said. And, you're ignoring everything else I said, like when I specifically addressed your concern about the size of particles moving through the mask, or when I specifically addressed your argument belittling a desire to stay 100% covid free even though it probably won't kill 98% of people who are infected by it (which seems relatively high considering the stats of this country, but I'll let it slide because I agree it's not that deadly). I also specifically addressed your argument about research, and I invited you to show me the research you've done that backs up anything that you say. All you come back with are misinterpretations of elementary science, and no citations because no expert you've read actually said what you believe.</p>
<p>You can feel free to shut down this conversation, but you'd be a hypocrite. In a non-partisan discussion in a free thinking community claiming to be an open forum for covid19 discussion, you're walking away from facts without giving your own. The only reason this discussion is going back and forth without any progress is because I feel like I'm doing all the work. I've brought you an article or two (can't remember who I'm talking to but I've been ripping articles out the ass for two days now), and I've provided basic explanations for processes (which by the way, after further research, have come up with a few new concepts to discuss but I see you're done). </p>
<p>I'm actually surprised you even said I haven't responded to anything you've actually said when I literally quote you almost verbatim. What's an example of me misrepresenting you, because I'm not aware that I did that and would like to know what you actually meant. Otherwise, that little feeling inside where you can't point to a single example I misrepresented you but still think I don't know what you're talking about is just a resistance to open minded discussion.</p>

        <p>What do you think you're doing in this community? Spending your free time posting screenshots and belittling people for their beliefs regardless of if they're valid or not. Me coming here to be open minded and spark a discussion in an otherwise anti-establishment and doctor denying echochamber is not the problem. The problems are the cesspools, and if you really believed in free speech and being open minded (unlike a lot of these communities on reddit) then you wouldn't be saying all this dumb shit discounting me and what I have to say while going back and posts rebutting an analogy about pants and pissing. I wouldn't say I'm the only one here using my free time to argue with people.</p>
<p>Also, we're gonna need to talk about doing research again and basing our arguments on expert findings, not being a know-it-all layman with a dunning krueger complex. "tHiNkiNg YoU KnOw BeTtEr ThAn OtHeRs" You really woke up and decided to use this phrase like you haven't spent the last year knowing better than actual physicians, epidemiologists and doctors all over the world. At least I've never claimed that anything I've cited was my own original idea, and I was very upfront and said I was a cybersecurity major not a doctor, and how all my information is based on what the medical science community has been studying. </p>
<p>Despite all the evidence out there for masks working, despite the simple, elementary explanation of the size difference between various gasses and respiratory droplets, and despite expert testimony, you still choose to believe your own reality, just like that 5-10% you just made up out of thin air. I'm not saying that not wearing a mask is the only reason the virus is spreading, I'm saying that if everyone wore a mask, the virus would spread less. Learning about shit you don't know about isn't supposed to be simple. Living in your own little bubble and coming to your own baseless conclusions, on the other hand, is actually pretty simple. It's simple minded, and it's a one-step process.</p>
