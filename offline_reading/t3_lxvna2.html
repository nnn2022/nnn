    <strong>Wokeness has far more in common with Calvinism than it does Communism.</strong>
    <p><p>Wokeness can be defined as a philosophy with the central belief that advocacy for those innately less endowed than oneself is righteous; and from my perspective, it’s a direct philosophical descendant of Calvinism.</p>
<p>It can be observed that everywhere Wokeness is culturally prevalent, there’s also a historical Calvinist cultural influence; and the correlation is quantitatively proportional. In other words, the more that a culture has been influenced by Calvinism in the past, the more woke it’s likely to be today. Case in point, Wokeness is by far the most prevalent in the US, it’s point of origin, which happens to be the country historically most associated with Puritanism, a particularly extreme form of Calvinism. Furthermore, Wokeness has only seemed to spread as a philosophy where there’s a Calvinist cultural undercurrent; in other words, you’re more likely to find people who are receptive to woke philosophy in places like New Zealand and South Korea than you are in Japan or Russia.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that Wokeness is an entirely secular philosophy, it’s neither a religion nor a political ideology. What’s interesting about these types of philosophies is the fact that they can serve an interchangeable role with religion from a psychological point of view. In other words, Wokeness can be contrasted with philosophies such as Individualism, Absurdism, and Epicureanism, not ideologies such as Socialism, Fascism, and Liberalism. In a nutshell, it’s possible to live your personal life in accordance with a philosophy or religion, but not a mere ideology. We can also say that all religions are philosophies, but not all philosophies are religions; by comparison, ideologies are not standalone philosophies.</p>
<p>Calvinism and Wokeness both operate on guilt based morality (Nietzschean resentment), rather than that of honour (Nietzchean sentiment). The two philosophies also imply that all individuals are born sinful (though wokeness professes that sinfulness is proportional to endowment, which must be compensated for with advocacy for those innately less endowed). Furthermore, both philosophies are puritanical and totalistic in nature; no amount of heresy or blasphemy is tolerated, and one must judge everything, however minor, through the lens of the philosophy wherever it’s possible to do so.</p>
<p>Wokeness is ultimately a philosophical reaction to Secular Humanism, which is a reaction to Evangelicalism, which ultimately stems from Calvinism. The culture behind these philosophies has remained largely unchanged since Oliver Cromwell was the dictator of England.</p>
<p>So does the average woke zealot have more in common culturally with Cromwell or Lenin? Of course, Cromwell.</p>

        <p>Wokeness is a religion that has been run through a couple wordfilters. And it always struck me as a better fit for catholicism.  Instead of God, you have diversity. Instead of satan, you have Donald Trump. Instead of original sin, you have privilege. Instead of cathedrals, you have Twitter. Instead ofIndulgences, you have patreon donations.  The only way in which they fundamentally differ aside from the names, is that unlike Catholicism, Wokeness  Has no concept of redemption.</p>

        <p>The no redemption aspect, cultural prudeness, and overall zealotry is part of the reason why I think it’s a Calvinistic philosophy.</p>

        <p>I may need to read up on calvinism. I'll admit to being fairly ignorant about it</p>

        <p>That is an interesting supposition but I am thinking of other factors as well. Calvinism is a subset of the protestant reformation. Though it was most prominent during the protestant reformation, there have since been numerous other denominations that have had far greater influence over religious thought in the west. Therefore it would be more accurate to say "protestantism" as opposed to calvinism. </p>
<p>You mentioned that predominatly calvinist nations have suffered most from wokeness. I would add that it could be because of universalist democratic principles have allowed these nations have more open societies and as a result allow for greater diversity of race, religion, and ideology. Allowing for woke racial ideologies to become prevalent. Closed societies like those in the middle east do not suffer from these ideologies because they are largely homogenous/theocratic therefore do not allow for diversity of race or thought. </p>
<p>I agree with your point that wokeness is filling a vacuum left by protestantism. I believe it is because of the weakening of the influence of the church in western societies. Destructive ideologies have taken their place. Like you said they share a number of similarities. Communism has a utopian component much like the concept of "a kingdom of god." They identify with a priesthood of intellectuals and authority structure. There are woke evangenlists who seek to convert the uninitiated. There are radicals who believe violence is justified as a means of spreading their ideology. </p>
<p>Though I'm not sure the problem could have been ameliorated if the West remained catholic. Russian communism took over a monarchic eastern orthodoxy system. They simply divided among class boundaries rather than racial. Marx himself states that communism cannot exist outside of capitalism since capitalism produces the drastic stratification of class structures. So that could be something to consider as well.</p>

        <p>I really like your response, and I tend to agree that wokeness is also very compatible with other Protestant cultural influences such as Lutheranism in places like Sweden; though I figured calling out Protestantism in general, and not the particular sect of Calvinism which is associated with puritanical thought and no salvation would be something of a step too far.</p>

        <p>I could go on and on about how wokeness is a religion. There is blasphemy (saying a racial slur.) A veneration of martyrs, George Floyd, Mike Brown, etc. The heretics are brown/black people who are not woke. The orthodoxy is basically anything CNN says.</p>

        <p>There was an article in National Post, saying that woke war on Christmas is basically 1 to 1 replica of puritan war on Christmas. I think this is right up your alley. The author is jewish, which helps with an unbiased third-person look on the situation</p>
