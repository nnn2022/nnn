    <strong>Olympian Kerri Walsh Jennings made IG post saying she bravely went maskless to store; mob attacks.</strong>
    <p><p>Three time Olympic gold medalist Kerri Walsh Jennings made an Instagram that she went shopping without a mask and called it "a little exercise in being brave". She wanted to stand up for her rights.</p>
<p>Of course,  the doomers descended and forced her to apologize. </p>

        <p>To be fair, her apology read more like, "I'm sorry you feel that way". Plus, she said she believes that high quality masks work (N95?), which is what the scientific literature suggested before the pandemic.</p>

        <p>I wasn’t familiar with her before this but I like the way she worded it. I feel like after 6 months of This  I have come to a conclusion. Doomers are not more emphatic than us. They’re not smarter than us. They’re naive. That’s it. That’s the big difference. They trust whatever they’re told . They think everyone has good intentions despite being shown evidence of the opposite. It’s pretty clear where this is heading and everyone just ignores it because they have bought into the narrative that’s it’s embarrassing to not believe whatever the government says.</p>

        <p>My mask protects no one. You can still get infected with a virus even if everyone around you wears masks. Want to know how I know this? Because people who test positive for COVID aren't issued a mask and told to go back to their daily lives. </p>
<p>If you're sick and you need to leave your home, wear a mask to let others know to avoid you. If you are high-risk and need to leave your home, wear a mask with good filtering capability. This will also let others know to avoid you.</p>

        <p>Wow, such misinformation. You should check your sources. Sick people aren’t told to just go back to their daily lives. </p>
<p>Masks aren’t 100% effective, just like seat belts aren’t 100% effective, but you still wear one. Masks still greatly reduce the chances of spreading the infection. The goal is to reduce the rate of infections. </p>
<p>Not all sick people are aware they have the virus. If everyone wears a mask, it’s a simple thing to stop this pandemic.</p>

        <p>Is your reading capacity impaired? There was no misinformation in anything I said.</p>
<p>The mask does not GREATLY reduce the spread. If you believe that, then kindly show the proof that they do. By the way, the goal was to spread the inevitable infections out so that care needn't be rationed. We did. Now the goalposts have been moved to "reduce the rate," or in some places "eliminate spread." Sorry, that's not what I signed on for.</p>
<p>Stay away from people who are uncovered and you won't catch what they are unaware that they might possibly have. If everyone follows this advice, it's a simple thing to stop this pandemic. You are not responsible for my health. It's on me to avoid contact with people if I want to stay uninfected.</p>

        <p>When you said “My mask protects no one.” That is not true. </p>
<p>Masks are an effective part of the strategy to prevent the spread of the virus. </p>
<p>The Mayo Clinic says “face masks combined with other preventive measures, such as frequent hand-washing and social distancing, help slow the spread of the virus.”</p>
<p>The CDC says “Cloth face coverings are one of the most powerful weapons we have to slow and stop the spread of the virus – particularly when used universally within a community setting. All Americans have a responsibility to protect themselves, their families, and their communities.”</p>
<p>And JAMA says “Covering mouths and noses with filtering materials serves 2 purposes: personal protection against inhalation of harmful pathogens and particulates, and source control to prevent exposing others to infectious microbes that may be expelled during respiration. When asked to wear face coverings, many people think in terms of personal protection. But face coverings are also widely and routinely used as source control.”</p>
<p>That’s the proof that you asked for. Happy to oblige.</p>

        <p>That is not proof. Those are statements made without a shred of proof, using words and phrases like "help" and "combined" and "widely and routinely used."</p>
<p>Show me a study that says that my mask protects another masked person from catching a virus that I have. There isn't one, but you're welcome to look anyway. As I said above, if it did indeed protect in that way, health officials could simply issue masks to those who test positive. </p>
<p>My cloth mask is not something that any hospital or healthcare worker would consider wearing in a professional manner. It's a piece of cloth, similar to other masks we see on people around us. It allows my breath to escape through the sides and top (and the proof of that is that it fogs my glasses when I wear it). Within that breath, if I am infected with a virus, are the droplets that carry it toward others. Some of that breath will collect on the inside of my mask. Some will take the path of least resistance and flow around it. Some will go directly through it. </p>
<p>Any way you look at it, it isn't protecting me, and it isn't protecting those around me. They can still catch what I have, and I can still catch what they have. The way to prevent spread is <strong>distance</strong>, which you can fully control. Don't get anywhere near anyone, and you'll never catch what they have, whether they are wearing a mask, not wearing one, wearing one with a exhalation valve, or wearing it below their nose.</p>

        <p>The JAMA issue I used the previous quote from has a study that shows how universal masking reduced the rate of infection. </p>
<p>https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768533</p>
<p>The data shows exactly what you asked for: 
“During the preintervention period, the SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate increased exponentially from 0% to 21.32%, with a weighted mean increase of 1.16% per day and a case doubling time of 3.6 days. During the intervention period, the positivity rate decreased linearly”
That’s one. </p>
<p>Surgeons wear a mask when performing surgery for the same reason. They don’t want their germs directly infecting a patient. The surgical mask isn’t a 100% blocker of their breath, but it reduces the amount that goes towards the patient. 
That’s all that health professionals are asking people to do. Reduce the odds of spreading the infection by wearing a simple mask in addition keeping our distance.</p>

        <p>That study measured something very different than what we're discussing. The healthcare workers in the study were trained in the proper use of PPE, so it's not likely that they were wearing homemade cloth masks, and while the patients weren't trained, they also likely weren't wearing those cheap paper things we see a lot of now. </p>
<p>As I stated earlier, universal mask use did not stop patients from infecting healthcare workers. They did appear to reduce the infection rate, but I've never argued that they didn't. </p>
<p>My statement is simple, and proven by your quoted study: someone wearing a mask can indeed catch a virus from a masked infected person. But someone who stays far away from an infected person, so far as we know, cannot catch what they have. </p>
<p>(By the way, in 2015 someone did a study on surgical mask use. They couldn't prove any effectiveness in reducing infections, but masks are still worn to keep surgeons/hospitals from getting sued. Looks like they're wearing them out of fear as well.)</p>

        <p>Yes, you can. 
Look at Japan as an example. Their reaction to the coronavirus was that everyone should wear a mask, and they did. Now their schools are open and cases are very low. 
Japan has had 1,377 total deaths from COVID-19, while the US had over 5,000 deaths just in September. </p>
<p>You are correct, if everyone in the US wears a mask, we can cut out the social distancing BS.</p>

        <p>Now that's some prime misinformation there. Countries that "did it right," so to speak, didn't rely on mask-wearing, because every time it's relied upon, it fails spectacularly. And places like Florida and Californis only had spread rise after mandating mask-wearing.</p>
<p>Distancing is the most important tactic in the arsenal, and it's one that YOU control. See someone you don't know? Stay away from them, the farther the better. Now you don't have to worry about whether they've washed their hands, or if they're properly covering their face, or if they caught something yesterday and they don't know it yet.</p>

        <p>What non-infected people do doesn’t make a bit of difference. And guess what, 99.9% of us are not infected. So why should we all cover our faces and cut off normal social interaction? It’s absurd.</p>
