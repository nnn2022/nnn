    <strong>"Masks shouldn't be political"</strong>
    <p><p>This is a sentence (or some vague variation thereof) uttered quite regularly over the past few months.</p>
<p>Masks are very much a political thing. Wearing a mask is a symbol (either knowingly or otherwise) of support for the almost entirely uniform overblown reaction to this virus. Not wearing one means that you acknowledge that the reaction to this is quite overblown, and likely to cause vastly greater damage than would otherwise have been the case if we had taken a more proportionate response to this. </p></p>

        <p>They are 100% political. Even if that wasn't their intent originally, all the hyperpartisan bloviating around masks got mixed in with everything else that pushed the overreaction to this thing. </p>

        <p>Nah it was during the BLM protests where they justified it by saying they were wearing masks. Pretty much everyone up until May was like “hey masks may or may not work but it’s worth a try” then BLM hit and it became purely political and about white SJWs condescending on your for “not saving lives”</p>

        <p>If they worked you would see large decreases in places with high compliance, yet you don’t. “But not enough people are wearing them!” Is how they keep the heat on the people instead of taking blame for failed lockdown and voodoo mask policies.</p>

        <p>Anyone who says wearing masks is following the science doesn't understand that science is a process, not a religion.  If we were in a clinical trial for mask use the trial would have been ended for ineffectiveness and possible harm because the outcome is clear, masks don't work.  </p>
<p>Look at NY, CA, CO, MA, NJ, etc.  Basically 100% mask compliance yet cases "exploding" but now look at IA, SD, NE, FL, GA, etc.  Low mask compliance and cases are less "explody" so it's clear there is no effect.  Anyone who says it's due to differences in population density is being an idiot.  Go to an Applebees or Safeway in MA and then IA, there are just as many people per sqft in both indoor locations.</p>

        <p>There is a mask mandate in Omaha, NE.  We’ve had it since August.  Compliance is the highest I’ve seen so far and the cases are at their highest levels.  I’m convinced all of these cloth masks increase the chance of infection.</p>

        <p>Anywhere outside of Omaha and Lincoln pretty much everyone sees this for what it really is.  Don’t be afraid to go with out a mask anywhere in Omaha.  The mandate is really weak and you’ll find a majority of the places don’t really care.  There is the occasional liberal pussy you’ll run into that will throw a fit so you have to be prepared to stand your ground and say you’re medically exempt.  If they still put up a fight you have to be prepared to leave and not give them your business.  Don’t let them win by putting on the muzzle and sticking around.</p>

        <p>Yes, because masks are supposed to be treated as a biohazzard. Disposable, 1 hour use, put it on take it off toss it. Don't touch it, don't pull it down and put it back up, don't hang it on your chin, and if you do do those things, toss it and start over. You breath on it, you're going to start cultures of nasty stuff, that you will then inhale. As with everything, we're doing it all wrong and the idiots are yelling at everyone they'd better start doing it wrong with them.</p>

        <p>It's the same in Europe. Look at the Czech Republic, Italy and Spain. High compliance but deaths are rising. Even here in the UK where mask compliance is also high, our cases and deaths were decreasing but started increasing once masks were introduced. A coincidence? Maybe deaths increased because masks were introduced round about the same time non-essential stores, restaurants and bars started opening up and that caused the spike but surely it shouldn't make a difference if masks actually worked, especially with our high compliance? </p>
<p>As for science, I'd like to see the Danish mask study if it ever gets published...</p>

        <p>There's actually a lawsuit over this in Ohio.  Parents are suing the interim health director Lance Himes (who is actually an attorney) over masks for a few reasons, one of which is mandatory masks are forcing them to make a political statement.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2020/09/14/coronavirus-ohio-parents-sue-over-k-12-school-mask-mandate/5792812002/">From the Cincinnati Enquirer article</a>:  “Plaintiffs dissent from this view, yet are being compelled to  participate, and have their children participate in the state’s symbolic  endorsement of panic over process,” the complaint reads.</p>
<p>I don't know what happened with this suit. Probably nothing because Governor DeWine and his henchmen are dictators now.</p>

        <p>They made it political when they criticised a handful of anti-lockdown protesters as murderers but weeks later thousands and in cases tens of thousands (black trans lives matter in NYC)<br>

<p>They always claim that gatherings of tens of thousands did not spread COVID whatsoever. Which is ridiculous just looking at the photos.  </p>
<p>They <strong>made masks political by using it to aid their weaponisation of the idea of the enemy being "evil covid spreaders" but they are good and virtuous when they gather in 100x the number becaue masks are force fields that give immortality.</strong>  </p>
<p>That's ignoring the fact that theres many pictures of people not wearing masks at these rallies, touching them, having it on their chin.  </p>
<p>Whenever someone says masks aren't political, remind them of this.   </p>
<p>I've seen 100s of times at this point that while they call Trump a "superspreader" and attack people for just living life as "spreading". When you point out the gatherings of thousands they then say "BUT THEY ALL WEAR MASKS ZERO CASES"  </p>
<p>So how can anyone with a functioning brain cell say that they are not making masks political by engaging in such braindead hypocrisy and using it as the weakest crutch I ever saw to deflect from their wrongs.</p>

<p>This article compiles many studies into one, I would recommend reading the journals included in the link to (and go deeper down the rabbit hole if you haven't already). But yeah truth be told the are and idol propaganda symbol of government compliance. This was never about public health and it will never be about public health.

        <p>It's a similar discussion to anit-vax. You have the option to not do it, it's just your civic duty to do what is best for the general public. There is nothing bad that happens to you when you don't wear a mask, so why would you not wear a mask? It doesn't inconvinience you and it can save lives. It doesn't matter if it is an "overreaction." If wearing a mask can save even one life, why shouldn't you do it?</p>

        <p>No, it is not our civic duty to inconvenience ourselves for those that are genetically unfit for our environment. I'm short, skinny, and ugly. Where's my government-appointed girlfriend? Oh wait, I'm on my own when it comes to that. And comparing this to anti-vax, which is even worse. Risk your own health just because someone else's health and immune system are poor?

        <p>Yes why leave the house, if you can die? Why do anything at all? Why even exist? </p>
<p>I could slip and break my skull when walking down the stairs, so I better never do it again. I can get run over by a car when crossing the street, so better never do it again either. </p>

        <p>Yeah, but a mask isn't going to hurt you. You aren't going to magically strangle yourself with a mask. It does not inconvenience you enough for it to matter. It's a safety precaution.</p>

        <p>Corona won't last another 5 years. A vaccine will be created and distributed soon hopefully. Even so, you might want to consider wearing a mask if you are going to go outside when you have a cold. You aren't obligated of course but caring about others can make the world just 
 a bit better. Wearing a mask shouldn't be viewed as a bad thing, it just shows you are willing to do what you believe is best for the general public.</p>

        <p>First off whoever is downvoting you should stop, since you're actually one of the first "pro mask" people on reddit I've met, who aren't completely hostile towards those who disagree. </p>
<p>&rt;Corona won't last another 5 years. A vaccine will be created and distributed soon hopefully. </p>
<p>I hope so too, but what's to say that politicians won't use lockdowns in the future for things such as the common cold? What's stopping them from saying "oh the flu must be stopped too", and then they also lockdown? </p>
<p>&rt;Wearing a mask shouldn't be viewed as a bad thing, it just shows you are willing to do what you believe is best for the general public. </p>
<p>I'm not saying it's bad, I'm saying it's annoying and that I won't continue to do it, after this entire bullshit is over.</p>

        <p>You could have an accident and kill some people in a mishap. Maybe we should go ahead and lock you in a basement just to maybe “save one life”. </p>
<p>Do you understand how stupid that sounds?  The “just one life” argument is so pathetic. It tells me that you don’t even believe your own bullshit.</p>
