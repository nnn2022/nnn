    <p><p>Of course...I‚Äôm not saying I actually believe this, but it‚Äôs an interesting concept. How do you run a global ‚Äòfire drill‚Äô?</p></p>

        <p>Constant lockdowns for any virus or hell, any reason they pull out of their ass at all, at any time they want. "Climate lockdowns" are something I bet they'd love to impose on the plebs - can't have them doing what used to be rich people things, such as traveling, eating meat, driving your own car... and there are so many useful idiot plebs who would love that not understanding it's not actually about the climate so I genuinely fear it will be next.</p>

        <p>Remember when the governor of Michigan placed rules like this? </p>
<p>"Close areas of the store‚Äîby cordoning them off, placing signs in aisles, posting prominent signs, removing goods from shelves, or other appropriate means‚Äîthat are dedicated to the following classes of goods:</p>
<p>Carpet or flooring.
Furniture.
Garden centers and plant nurseries.
Paint."</p>
<p>Yes, paint. We all know paint is one of the main carriers of the virus. </p>
<p>Or my state, which has a curfew because "if people have large gatherings it's easier to hear who's violating social distancing laws at night time when everything is quiet".
All bars are closed. But apparently if they serve food they can stay open and serve alcohol.
It's like they pulled this stuff out of their ass.
Wtf is stopping paint sales and keeping bars open under the condition that they serve food actually going to do?</p>

        <p>Yes - it‚Äôs ramping up to get worse, and quickly. I think they‚Äôll give us a glimpse of freedom for the summer months, and maybe into early fall. Following that, in the next flu season, I think things may get really ugly. They‚Äôre going to keep pushing and pushing for the vaccines. They‚Äôll blame the next one on everyone who refused the vaccine. I think things will be really ugly by this time next year. I hope I am wrong.</p>

        <p>Several doctors have mentioned how a vaccine can make symptoms after exposure worse. If that is true, than next winter we might have some people get really sick.</p>

        <p>Absolutely!</p>
<p>Step 1: release minimally dangerous pathogen, run a 16+ month fear-based psyop, strip away freedoms, foment animosity between pro and anti- mask/vax and set up a biosecurity surveillance state.</p>
<p>Step 2: Allow the vaxxed to be exposed to wild coronaviruses that become extremely deadly via the antibody dependent enhancement. Hundreds of millions (potentially billions) of sick and dying people will collapse the healthcare system, resulting in the military being deployed as martial law is instituted worldwide.</p>
<p>Step 3: Mandatory jabs, isolation-cum-concentration camps, extermination of the diseased and the ungovernable, etc</p>

        <p>I'm starting to suspect that a large portion of this sub is being managed by saboteurs (possibly China's State Council Information Office) in order to subvert public health measures, erode public trust in medical institutions, and generally leave the United States more vulnerable to future bioweapons.</p>
<p>People here are right to question the effectiveness of surgical masks, but frankly I think they missed the point because we knew from the beginning that the n95 masks, not surgical masks, were the ones that actually offer protection.</p>
<p>As long as people are distracted by surgical masks they won't ask why we <em>still</em> have an n95 mask shortage a year later but China doesn't. (Then we might actually try to hold our leaders accountable, and they won't allow that will they?)</p>

        <p>I think it‚Äôs kind of morphed into that. A global fire drill. I don‚Äôt think it was planned from the start though. But they figured they could use all this information, for a future plague. It actually is valuable information. </p>
<p>Imagine a virus that killed 30-40% of people infected, with a peak mortality range amongst children and young adults. </p>
<p>It would be absolute total pandemonium.</p>
