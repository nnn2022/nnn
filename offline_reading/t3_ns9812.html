    <strong>Players of Event 201</strong>
    <p><p>Does anyone have an idea why nobody is looking into the "<a href="https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/players/">Players</a>" of <a href="https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/">Event 201</a>?</p>
<p>I don't want to get too much into Event 201, but I'm naturally suspicious of coincidences. If the outbreak didn't happen, I would have just thought, cool, they're being proactive. Scenario testing is a good thing. But just 1 months later, we start getting reports of a virus out of Wuhan. Then we find out that <a href="https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20210524/wuhan-lab-researchers-illness">3 lab workers tested positive</a> in November 2019, just 1 month following the event.</p>
<p>I mean, the event focuses exactly on what just happened and still in the middle of.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I never put any thought into this until someone posted a link to the John Hopkins #Event201 Tweet that showed a plush Virus doll. That got my wheels spinning. <a href="https://twitter.com/JHSPH_CHS/status/1184483676924436480?s=20">https://twitter.com/JHSPH_CHS/status/1184483676924436480?s=20</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>A quick search shows this.</p>

<p>not much, but did profit from COVID</p>
<p>&rt;Total net sales for the quarter ended December 26, 2020,were $3.2 billion, an increase of 18.6% compared with thefourth quarter of 2019, driven by sales of personal protective equipment (PPE)and COVID-19 related products.</p>
<p><strong>George Gao</strong> - <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2017.21487">https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2017.21487</a></p>
<p>This guy has direct ties to the Wuhan lab. Also, it seems clear that there were safety concerns early on.</p>
<p>&rt;“It will offer more opportunities for Chinese researchers, and our contribution on the BSL‑4-level pathogens will benefit the world,” says George Gao, director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology in Beijing. There are already two BSL-4 labs in Taiwan, but the National Bio-safety Laboratory, Wuhan, would be the first on the Chinese mainland."<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;" Future plans include studying the pathogen that causes SARS, which also doesn’t require a BSL-4 lab..."<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;" Many staff from the Wuhan lab have been training at a BSL-4 lab in Lyon, which some scientists find reassuring. And the facility has already carried out a test-run using a low-risk virus. "<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;" But worries surround the Chinese lab, too. The SARS virus has escaped from high-level containment facilities in Beijing multiple times, notes Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey. Tim Trevan, founder of CHROME Biosafety and Biosecurity Consulting in Damascus, Maryland, says that an open culture is important to keeping BSL-4 labs safe, and he questions how easy this will be in China, where society emphasizes hierarchy. "<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;" Trevan says China’s investment in a BSL-4 lab may, above all, be a way to prove to the world that the nation is competitive. “It is a big status symbol in biology,” he says, “whether it’s a need or not.”</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I think there are 3-4 options regarding the origins of SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>SARS-CoV-2</em> happened naturally. This idea was promoted early on. South Park did a pretty solid episode on how this possibly happened (/s). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNMRD9nCASw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNMRD9nCASw</a> (/s). I think most agree that SARS-CoV-2 didn't happen naturally.</li>
<li>SARS-CoV-2 was man-made and accidently released from the Wuhan lab. I think this is the most likely case.</li>
<li>SARS-CoV-2 was man-made and intentionally released. I don't see a reason why the Chinese Government would be involved in doing something like this. I also don't think the US government was involved. For China, it just doesn't make sense, as it infected them first. For the US, we were way to unorganized in responding to this, so I doubt we had any plans of such an event.</li>
<li>SARS-CoV-2 was man-made and intentionally released. What about the Private sector though? I don't think anybody can deny the fact that this would be a huge financial opportunity for any of the players involved. What if this was orchestrated by the private sector?</li>
</ol>
<p>just some thoughts.</p></p>
