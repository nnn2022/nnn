    <strong>Is it weird that I think this way?</strong>
    <p><p>From my true nature, Im actually a very goal driven, rational, and happy person. I like to joke around and spread good vibes when Im somewhere.
But in the past 10-15 years I would say, this got less and less due to so many people that are just garbage of character.
Many people on the internet are showing their true nature of toxicity. I dont see anyone praising anyone doing something good. Mostly they are doing the opposite. Talking people down, enjoying being evil, because that feeds their ego. 
And if youre someone successful, they just want something from your status. 
So that leads me to the theory that too many shitty people are around and they slow down the progress of evolution because they rather sit around all day and do nothing but useless things. 
Have you noticed how we are in a peak of technology and art?
There is not alot of innovation, there is alot of recylcing, a lot of copycats. Nobody dares to try something new, out of the box. 
Everything is getting milked to get the quick buck with no quality.</p>
<p>And like this we cannot evolve further. Or very very slowly. The useless eaters with their mentality are driving us down and try to stop our progress because they are too dumb to achieve anything. Nobody of them is even happy for your success or wants to support you.
And I came to conclusion, why would I talk about how the vaccine is bad and what all the plans from the big people are? Why would I waste my time talking to a useless eater, to perhaps save him ?
In a room of 10 people, perhaps 2 are intelligent enough or worth anything. 
Is it better to just let them get fucked and we with actual brains, that can think for ourselves, could continue our lives?
In the end we get nothing but hate from these people. 
They dont understand anything, they dont research, they dont ever read a damn book, they never do anything. 
They make us feel like trash. They deserve to get their  eternal holidays.
Maybe we could live on with better people around us?
That means if we avoid this natural selection and wait this issue to calm down. 
As we are too small compared to these apes that are allowing all this bullsh!t to happen. 
I personally dont think we can help a stupid person, nor I can think we can make a change. 
But I think we can make a change for ourselves in that group. We can protect ourselves from these monkeys and perhaps be considered â€žworthyâ€œ ?</p>
<p>I donâ€™t know. Im just done with this humanity.
There is really a small amount of people that you can talk to normally, that you can have fun with, that arent judging you for some thoughts. 
That are able to discuss as topic without getting emotional and labeling you a crazy conspiracy theorist, just because you researched actual things and they did not.</p>
<p>For my part, Im done trying to help other people.
Nobody helps me outside of this subreddit.
I appreciate all the things that are here posted to keep people informed and aware. 
But for me, I just let now everyone around me who I notice isnt very bright , take the vaccine and enjoy their â€žfreedomâ€œ. 
Id probably nod and say â€žwow good job! youre saving lives :)â€œ and walk away and dont care at all.</p>
<p>Simple just talk what the people like to hear and you will be worshipped. 
If you try to talk sense and actual eye opening things, you receive nothing but hate.
Just let them have this damn vaccine and hope that nobody will force us to take it.
I hope they leave us alone or devide us. 
I apologize if this is harsh.</p></p>

        <p>Well put. </p>
<p>&rt;I donâ€™t know. Im just done with this humanity. There is really a small amount of people that you can talk to normally,</p>
<p>I feel exactly the same way. And this is a paragraph which I wrote a while back and shared on My sub. It relates to only a very few.</p>
<p>Any Man in the modern age must be "The Gray Man." The grayÂ manÂ is the man who moves around the periphery of our awareness, without creating any stimulus. This makes that person invisible for all practical purposes.</p>
<p>And in today's society, any Knowledgeable/Wise man needs to follow this. Only talk with mature, logical people while avoiding all the clowns. You making sense and being practical will not do anyone good. Why? It's too late. Society already has collapsed and it's getting worser by the day. People simply aren't ready to hear the harsh truth.</p>
<p>So, be invisible and focus on your own goals and don't bother anyone. The example I like to give regarding this is, be the Predator. The Predator is far too smart and different from society, so he stays in the jungle doing his own thing. His Intellect, and way of thinking, and knowledge, is far too beyond and great comparing to any humans, and he's a very unique 1. Too bad, they don't know that the Predator thrives in the shadows and is far too Great for society. </p>
<p>And because, no 1 is so Intellectually capable on His level of thinking, and mindset, he simply has gone His own way, far away from society doing his own thing. And not bothering anyone, and if someone were to bother him, they are effed by the predator himself.</p>
<p>Me, You and very few Us here, are like the Predator. We know too much, experienced, know the whole game in and out and realized that's it's all the same and not worth it. Whether, it's about the harsh truth about this clown society or anything. Only a very few Us know it all. While, most normies and clowns, will stay in their delusional, fantasy worlds. And We? Like the Predator have gone Our Own way and away from the clownery of society, and from the dreamland/delusional fantasy.</p>

        <p>At first, I wanted to warn everyone and I did. I've been waiting for this move for a long time. We have all been told the New World Order is coming. Only a few of us actually believed them.</p>
<p>But now, after all the denial, and the ease at which so many have been duped by this obviously fraudulent "vaccine", a large part of me has started to pull for the elites. I have no idea what my future holds, but if they sacrifice a bunch of worthless sheep first, so be it.</p>
<p>After all the sheep are gone, we finally get down to brass tacks.</p>
