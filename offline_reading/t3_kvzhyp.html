    <strong>How long until the definition is officially changed? The vaccine isn't really a vaccine.</strong>
    <p><p>So the Covid vaccine neither protects you from contracting or spreading it. Explain to me how it is a "vaccine"?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>vaccine[vakˈsēn]NOUN</p>

<li><strong>a substance used to stimulate the production of antibodies and provide immunity against one or several diseases, prepared from the causative agent of a disease, its products, or a synthetic substitute, treated to act as an antigen without inducing the disease.</strong></li>

        <p>Yeah, it's only a matter of time, I'm sure. Instead of vaccine, I'm now using the term, "synthetic pathogen", as stated by the Doctor in this video:</p>

        <p>The COVID-19 vaccine does prevent catching the disease.</p>
<p>Yes. COVID-19 vaccination works by teaching your immune system how to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID-19, and this protects you from getting sick with COVID-19
<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/facts.html">From the CDC</a></p>
<p>It works similarly to your bodies natural response do diseases with building immunity, and similarly to other vaccines, so yes it is a vaccine.</p>

        <p>This is because no safety measure is 100% effective. Masks, socially distancing, and the vaccine all have their own flaws, but when working in unison, provide a much lower chance of infection.</p>
<p>A good way of putting it is like layers of swiss cheese. Throw one slice down on a table (Social distancing), and you’ll still be able to see beneath it, (High probability of catching virus), throw another one down, it will cover up some of the holes left by the other one, continuing to stack these layers of swiss cheese (Safety measures) will ensure a much much lower chance of infection.</p>
<p>Here’s another example. In your car, you probably wouldn’t feel safe driving without a seatbelt and without your airbags on, and if you got into an accident, you would likely be injured or die. Wearing a seatbelt makes this much safer, using airbags makes it exponentially safer still, and finally, being in a car that is specially designed to withstand impacts is going to be, get this, safer. All these examples could have parallels drawn to them with COVID.</p>
<p>I will be taking the vaccine as soon as it becomes available to me, even though I wear masks and socially distance myself, because at the end of the day, I would like the lowest chance possible of catching a potentially deadly viral illness.</p>

        <p>That's cool. Go ahead and get the vaccine. Be sure to post your card on reddit so you can get that sweet sweet karma. I will take the .1% risk that I will contract it and die.
Question though. Do you drive? Because every time you drive the chance of you dying is higher than that of catching Covid and dying.</p>

        <p>The fewer people that take the vaccine the more time you will have to spend in this ‘New Normal, that you hate so much, if <a href="https://www.muhealth.org/our-stories/covid-19-vaccine-key-reaching-herd-immunity">80-90% </a>of people took the vaccine we would  be able to return to our old lives, the higher this percentage gets, the less the risk becomes, even if your increasing that percent by just a fraction of a percent, you’re still helping.

        <p>Information and statistics about the disease change often because it is fairly new in the grand scheme of things. Just because <em>some</em> doctors and nurses are refusing the vaccine doesn’t mean you shouldn’t. Oh, and many of those headlines about doctors and nurses are misleading. ‘Some healthcare workers refuse to take COVID-19 vaccine, even with priority access’ is one I found, and in the subtitle of that article it says the nurse refused because she wasn’t sure it was safe for pregnant woman, and she was 6 months pregnant.</p>

        <p>So when should we expect to stop wearing masks and social distancing and locking down if not now that the vaccine is out? If covid is as swift-changing and highly contagious as they say it doesn't seem like it'll ever fully go away. So I don't quite understand what it is that you think will happen once 80-90% people get this "vaccine" or what will happen when that goal isn't met (as it's unrealistic af)</p>

        <p>This strain of virus will go away once people have either been either naturally or medically immunized, and it reaches a point where the virus runs out of hosts to live off. Vaccinations will certainly be beneficial to this process as people won’t have to be infected to build immunity. This current strain will almost certainly be gone by this year, either people will take more precautions, or, sadly, enough people will catch it to the point that everyone has either recovered, or died. Most likely, there will be a new mutation every year or couple of years, like the flu, and people will go about wearing masks, getting their vaccines, and socially distancing while it’s active.</p>
<p>TLDR; once there are enough doses for everyone</p>

        <p>Yeaahhhhh that doesn't sound anywhere close to normal and is hence a "new normal" that will happen whether many people get the vaccine or not. To repeat this cascade of bs every year until there's enough doses of new vaccines/immunity is reached for new stains is what people don't want. </p>
<p>This isn't as deadly as they low-key hoped it would be so they're trying to pretend that it is. What's going on right now is a circus show and I really don't understand why so many are not only willing to get this vaccine but are also bullying people into getting it as well when it seems like it won't change sht.

The reality is this virus is here to stay, and that is terrible, we all want to go back to being able to go outside and see our friends, but we will have to deal with life with COVID because it won’t go away quickly on its own.</p>

        <p>Exactly, we have to live with it. If deaths are the concern there needs to be more talk and action about preventing serious affects through other means (exercise, vitamins, etc) and vaccines/other precautions if they want them. If other people want the vaccine, feel free. People should stay home/wear masks when experiencing symptoms (much like what should have been happening in the past) as those who don't have symptoms are less likely to transfer the virus anyway. If people want to continue to wear masks and social distance, that's their prerogative.</p>
<p>In any case, forcing people to lockdown (especially those who are perfectly healthy/experiencing no symptoms) will only bring about more casualties in other ways. Deaths that are likely far more than the 1.95m (not quite millions and not taking into account how these numbers are likely inflated) out of over 90m worldwide thus far. Forcing people to wear masks that essentially don't even work and may cause other health issues down the road is also not constructive. We've survived MUCH worse in the past without all this extra stuff and we'll be just fine going forward. Death sucks in any way but unfortunately it's a part of life, we can't run or hide from it</p>
<p>Edit: I got those numbers straight from typing in "deaths from covid" on Google. No deep search. But then again who really knows anyway</p>

        <p>Your very close to what I’m trying to get at here, while yes, exercising is beneficial to your immune system, it should not be the main precaution to take, masks and vaccines are both extemely effective and should be the main priority. While it’s <em>arguable</em> that creating laws enforcing them could be a violation of rights (I don’t feel this way, masks are fairly inconsequential to wear, while vaccines are a little more involved, and I could smell the conspiracy theories from her if they were required, they are still also very beneficial), it’s been proven to help substantially by countries other than the US.</p>
<p>In regards to locking down healthy people, there are a few things. Asymptotic people would still be going outside, because they assume they’re healthy, symptoms can take a few days to show, and a healthy person can still catch and spread COVID.</p>
<p>I hope I can help change your mind on this at least a little bit. I also appreciate you not calling me an idiot, it makes it much easier to have a civilized conversation.</p>

        <p>I don't believe in the name-calling so much, but admittedly do so when I'm upset lol.</p>
<p>Asymptomatic people aren't very likely to contribute to the spread, that's why I say it's not right to keep them locked up. I think if you're experiencing true signs, you need to take some time to recover, as anyone should regardless of the cause. Continuing to social distance isn't a terrible idea and would make them likelihood of catching the virus from potential asymptomatic/pre symptomatic people close to zero. Hold your breath if needed and practice proper hygiene and you should be golden. I socially distanced before this and practiced proper hygiene, simply because people are bloody gross, and hardly ever caught anything. Masks, though harmless to put on, can still transmit the virus and can contribute to other illnesses. So I wouldn't want to force people to do that. Vaccine enforcement, forget about that entirely I won't even go into how stupid that is at the current time. In the end, individuals must be responsible for themselves. Trying to receive full compliance in anything won't happen, and if forced that only opens a different box of issues. We're edging really close to totalitarianism under the guise of "not enough people are doing it so we're still suffering and will need to make restrictions harder until everyone complies". I struggle to see any good rationalization for that being ok.</p>
<p>But qué será será. And apologies if none of this is coherent, I'm quite tired.....of it all</p>

        <p>I love that swiss cheese analogy. I've had trouble explaining this to people. They seem to be under the impression that if they do one thing, that's fine. And that a new thing isn't worth doing too. Or, that if nothing is 100% effective, it isn't worth doing anything at all.</p>
<p>Another good resource for this is the video the guy from Vox did which talks about the combinations of masks and how effective they are. Like one person wearing it next to someone who isn't... Both people etc...</p>

        <p>Right... Because a video sponsored by bioskin (mask company) isn't pushing an agenda.</p>
<p>He forgets to mention in his video the efficacy of cloth/surgical masks. Along with the fact that masks actually increase the chance of upper respiratory infections by about 3 times. N95 masks are the gold standard for masks but the filters need replaced every hour or so.</p>
<p>The Cloth and surgical masks are only good for about 15 minutes or till the mask gets wet. Once wet it is a literal face diaper.</p>
