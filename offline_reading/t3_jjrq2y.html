    <strong>Does anyone here have or had COVID?</strong>
    <p><p>I am currently working from home due to a positive test and it's the biggest non-event of my life. I had a mild headache with a cough after two days I was fully recovered. My wife is completely asymptomatic. If nobody told me I had it I would of never noticed. Yes, COVID can be a serious problem to some people but not to most.</p>
<p>The funniest part is I am shocked it took me this long to get it. I have literally done everything the doomers say not to do for months without a problem. I never stopped going to work in my office job, have been to indoor restaurants, malls, movie theaters, family gatherings, amusement parks and even the dreaded indoor church. The fact I got it from my super doomer mother in law makes it even funnier.</p>
<p>Wondering if anyone else here has a similar experience.</p></p>

        <p>Covid made me invulnerable. I’ve never been sick since. I was in a train derailment where I was the sole survivor. I also can bench like a mofo now. It also made it so I can hear people’s thoughts if I touch them. It’ll help when I go back to work as a security guard at a college football stadium.</p>

        <p>The Dread Virus hit our house this week (at least we think so; we're not bothering to go get tested).  The symptoms were pretty minor -- chills, fever, fatigue, loss of sense of taste.  Unpleasant,  sure.  But not worth shutting down the whole country over.</p>

        <p>Got it last week. Slight headache, fever of 99.5, mild cough, no loss of taste or smell, and it lasted less than 3 days. Same boat as you - throughout all this I never stopped going out or doing the things doomers call you a grannykiller for doing - and it still took 8 fucking months for me to get it.</p>

        <p>My girlfriend and I both had some mild sore throats and mild spike in temperature about two months ago, but we didn’t bother to go get tested. She’s a doomer so I didn’t want to escalate it anymore than what it was already at. It only lasted two days, but we still stayed home for a good period of time after that just for the sake of potentially spreading.</p>

        <p>I think we all had it back in Jan-Feb. We have a kid in grade school, my wife works at a school, and I travel to NYC a lot for work, so it all adds up that we caught it early. We all had a chronic dry cough that lasted about 2 weeks. Mine was a little longer, but I vape so I understand why I was hit harder with the cough. </p>
<p>Shortly after we recovered, we found out our neighbors all tested positive for it in early March. We are pretty close with them, the kids are always wrestling and playing, we shake hands and hug a lot. I even share joints with one of their sons, so I wouldn't doubt we had it and gave it to them. </p>
<p>None of them died, none of them even got that sick. The mother was hit the worst, but she is obese and has other health issues. And even she survived and was only on OTC meds for common colds.</p>

        <p>Considering there is NO VIRUS... No</p>
<p>Only thing people are getting is the common cold or flu which they now claim is Covid.</p>
<p>If you are sick and test positive you just have the flu and nothing more.</p>
<p>Stop falling for their BS lies that there is a deadly virus floating around.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The PCR test is bogus and not designed to check for a virus. It was made to search for genetic material in our body which we all have.  If it is set to 30/35 you will test negative. but if it is set to 60/65 amplification you’ll test positive because it is detecting your genetic material. This is why it gives an 80% false positive, they have set many test to amplify. <br>
The inventor of the test stated many times IT CAN NOT BE USED TO FIND A VIRUS</p>

        <p>we all have trillions of virus particles within us all the time. The question is whether these particles are a response to something else (ie bacteria infection, immune system working as it should, toxicity from air / food / water / vaccines), or if it's something that we "catch." Check out terrain theory vs. germ theory. Mind blowing stuff.</p>

        <p>I got covid on August and it wasn't pretty. It was quite annoying and weird. </p>
<p>Week 1: I started feeling high pressure on arms and legs. They were feeling heavy. I also had problems to sleep. I assumed I had covid ( even without making a test ), so I started taking ivermectin, azitrhomycin and Vitamin D ( all started during 2nd day of symptoms) and I took them for 5 days. </p>
<p>Week 2: The symptoms from week 1 disappeared completely. However, new symptoms appeared. I lost palate and smell. I also started getting way too much tired and I barely could walk. I got worried because so many people lost smell and palate for weeks. Fortunately, I lost them for 3 days and in the same week, they came back to normal.</p>
<p>Week 3: No symptoms from week 1 and 2. New symptom: I started coughing up like crazy. I got worried about my lungs. It was a dry cough, with zero secretion. I rushed to the Hospital and there was nothing wrong with my lungs. They were 100% clean. </p>
<p>By the end of week 3, I did the serology for covid and it was positive. So yeah, I assumed I had covid without even knowing it was covid until the end of it. Then all returned back to normal and I had nothing else.</p>

        <p>I had it in February. That's right, it was around back then. Sore throat, slight fever, a little bit of coughing and general malaise. Took a day off work, and was good as new by the end of the week. I'm glad I got it before the panic otherwise I wouldn't have been treated like a human.</p>

        <p>I have it. Tested positive. Currently hiding with family. Two days of stuffiness and very mild fever. Little bit of fatigue and a headache. I’ve been MUCH sicker before. I have lost my smell though... but that’s also pretty normal with nasal colds.</p>

        <p>Two days ago I got the mildest of mild sore throats and a some very minor congestion.  No fever, no cough, no loss of smell.  I am 99% sure I don’t have the virus. also refuse to be tested over the nothing-burger-sniffles I have, it’s not worth the drama in the off chance I test positive.  I drank lots of water and tea, ate super healthy food, and took a little sudaphed.  Out of respect for others I have stayed home, I feel fine today.  This shit is normal and I don’t understand what nightmare world we live in now.</p>

        <p>Not me, though I suspect I have had it already.  I didn't even bother to get an antibody test.  But my in-laws had a very similar experience.  My father-in-law didn't even get sick, just a little funny feeling, kind of like when your allergies are acting up.  None of the classic symptoms at all: no cough, no lost sense of smell, no fever.  They got positive results because they had been exposed to it early, early on.</p>

        <p>I had it in March. Back then I had a trip to Hawaii coming up and I was terrified I’d get sick and either have a miserable trip or not be able to go (of course it got cancelled anyway). So in an effort to stay healthy, I stayed home. I cloroxed my groceries. I didn’t leave my apt for 3 weeks. 2 weeks into that I tested positive for covid. Staying home and being overly cautious sure saved me /s </p>
<p>Almost no symptoms, bit of trouble breathing, slight fever. I’ve had colds worse. I don’t think much of anything can actually stop it, if you’re a human around other humans it’s a possibility.</p>
<p>As a side note I’ve had way more colds in the past few months than ever, I think all this sanitizing is tanking my immune system and resistance to anything. I want the germs</p>

        <p>I've been exposed- essential worker in a hospital, I do all the shopping, etc... I've not taken any time off from the real world since this started and I've never once been sick.  </p>
<p>So while I've had it, I must have been one of the billions who were asymptomatic.</p>

        <p>I’m 99% sure I had it in July. Had bad flu-like symptoms. Doctor said I was presumptive positive. I tested negative but the nurse swabbed me incorrectly. My girlfriend lives with her grandma and her grandma tested positive around the same time as me, so my girlfriend likely had it, was asymptomatic, and gave it to both of it. Oh, and her grandma survived without even having to be hospitalized so she’s not a grandma killer.</p>
<p>And I’d 100% go through it again before going through any lockdown bullshit.</p>

<p>Probably around that same time too. Only reason I didn't think it was a flu was the fever (which I literally never get).</p>

        <p>Only if you get colds all the time too, lol.</p>
<p>But seriously, the only reason I even noticed something was wrong were the chills, fever and sleeping a lot. Even a couple of days in, I was able to do most of my routine at maybe 40%. But I'm told my ma thought I was in literal, mortal danger.</p>

        <p>Why did you even get "tested"... that is the one sure guaranteed way to catch this casedemic. It is well documented that there are huge false positives. If you did not immediately drop dead, then you just had the common cold.</p>
