    <strong>Masks on flights</strong>
    <p><p>Has anyone been on a flight where you have to wear a mask? Is it possible to get out of it by saying you have breathing problems or something like that? I have managed to not wear a mask once throughout this shit show and I really don't want to start now but it looks like I will have to on a flight.</p></p>

        <p>I just got some snacks and drinks and continuously ate/drank for most of the flight so I could have my mask off. Had no issues. This may not work for longer flights though</p>

        <p>That’s awesome. So they don’t require it if you’re eating, thus negating the entire purpose of wearing a mask. Nice.</p>

        <p>Same, I do not want to leave my state right now. I live in WI, the story of the court case which led to the end of all mandates should be well known by now, all the states surrounding us are doing "new normal" partial reopenings, given that we had a <em>full</em> reopening I feel like we are an island a sea of crazy and I am not going anywhere until this crap dies down.</p>

        <p>I passed through WI on a road trip (escaping from a crazy state) recently and stopped to get some cheese. Everyone was so nice, there were no masks, and I felt like a normal human again! I’m so jealous that you live there (plus, the countryside was beautiful!)</p>

        <p>Tl;dr I think it just depends on who’s working that day on whether they’re gonna make you wear one or not bother to say anything/fight you on it</p>
<p>I flew to visit my dad at the end of May cause I hadn’t seen him in 5 months. I also haven’t worn a mask once, (which has become increasingly harder in California) so I was really nervous for my flights. I flew out of Long Beach airport (which requires masks at all times) and nobody at the airport said anything to me. When the Southwest lady scanned my boarding pass for me to board she told me I had to have a mask on. I told her I had a medical condition and she said ok and I continued. After I sat down and everyone else boarded a different flight attendant came over to me and asked if I had a mask to put on, and I told him I had a medical condition. He walked away angrily saying he never got the paperwork for that, cause there is no paperwork he was just mad he couldn’t force me to wear one. He never came back the entire flight. My connection was in Oakland, whose airport also requires masks, and an airport security guard stopped me and told me I had to have a mask on. I told him I had a medical condition and he asked what it was. I told him he can’t ask me that and he gave up and walked away. Nobody on my second flight said anything to me. </p>
<p>On my flights home miraculously nobody said a single word to me, not even in the airports and my connection was in Oakland again. Meanwhile my dad just flew down to see me a few days ago and they made him wear one but as soon as he sat down he took it off and just pretended to eat and drink for the whole flight. I think it just depends on the airline and who’s working that day. I did a ton of research before my flights and southwest seemed to be the most lax in their mask requirement. Some airlines threatened to ban you from their airline if you don’t comply though. Like I said it really just depends IMO.</p>

        <p>Thank you for that information. I flew Southwest out of San Jose, California the first week of May. The airport was requiring masks. I knew that Southwest was going to start requiring masks a few days later. At the door to the airport, an employee told me masks were required. I told him I had a medical condition, and he said okay. Nobody else in the airport said anything to me. Most people at the airport were wearing masks, with the exception of pilots and flight attendants. None of them walking through the airport had a mask. On the flight, only one flight attendant wore a mask. I assume all flight attendants wear masks on the flights now, but I thought it was interesting that when they had a choice, most chose to not wear a mask.</p>
<p>I've been a little nervous about flying again now that airlines are requiring masks. Your experience sounds more stressful than mine was, but still manageable for me.</p>

        <p>Dang you had your flights just in time then. That’s nice. Yeah all the flight attendants are wearing them now. I’m also surprised that most weren’t wearing one when given the choice. Although my dad told me he overheard one of the flight attendants talking to another one and saying “I hate this fucking thing” (referring to the mask) and how this is all bullshit. In fact he ended up talking to her later in the flight and she said if she didn’t literally need her job to survive she wouldn’t be there and wearing one. So maybe there are more people out there that are against this “new normal” than we think. </p>
<p>Well I wish you luck if you do book more flights soon. I haven’t decided yet if I’m gonna book more trips over summer. I’m afraid I just got lucky last time and I won’t be as lucky next time. I wish I could just spend the entire summer at my dads cause he lives in Idaho where things are basically 100% (their water parks are open lol) but I can’t really just take 2 months off work.</p>
