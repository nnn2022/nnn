<title>Recently I've heard there are only actually ~15,000-20,000 deaths from COVID in the UK, and this was recently reported by ONS. Does anyone have that article? I'm trying to find it</title>

    <p><p>UK has a ridiculously high IFR, of 0.9-1%. (1/8 of the UK have antibodies, with ~100 k reported deaths from COVID). </p>
<p>A relative recently told me the figures have been exaggerated and there's only been around 15 k to 20 k deaths from COVID, and this was recently reported by ONS. Does anyone have that article because I'm trying to find it?</p></p>
