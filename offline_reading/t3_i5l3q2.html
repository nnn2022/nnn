    <strong>Can you imagine if they took the obesity epidemic this seriously?</strong>
    <p><p>But this particular crowd would most likely protest if they started taxing unhealthy foodstuff, or shamed you nonstop on social media for eating poorly, or banned the sugary crap altogether. They would be crying freedom of choice and disregarding the health concerns.</p>
<p>Just a (highly controversial when it shouldn’t be) thought on the irony of this.</p></p>

        <p>In American history there was a point where we started to (think Super Size Me, healthy school lunches), maybe around the early to 2000s to 2010. Then the whole "body positivity" movement started, and all of a sudden we see obese people saying they are "healthy", and to be happy with your body no matter what. I don't know what happened.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don't think government intervention will help obesity, nor should it. It's not up to government to tell you what to eat and what not to eat. We need to stop normalizing overweight and obese bodies, and instead normalize healthy bodies. Stop the misconceptions that eating healthy costs more than eating junk food. I see this all over social media shared by teenagers who think this, who have probably never been in the produce aisle of a grocery store.</p>

        <p>Yup, I'm fat and in my 40s. It's not healthy and when you pass the big four-oh, that's when you find out how stupid you have been to get fat. Losing weight is the hardest battle I've had to deal with in my life - I have overcome other addictions (even smoking) but stuffing my fat face is a hard habit to break. </p>
<p>No-one should normalize this. I am lucky, I have a partner who loves me, stable(ish) income, etc. but if I didn't, I think if I was still in the state I am now - I'd probably off myself. As is, I shall keep trying to drop the pounds. </p>
<p>So, kiddies don't end up like me. Recognize fat for the pile of poison it is and don't get fat in the first place. There is nothing "positive" about it, whatsoever.</p>

        <p>Weight loss is incredibly hard, and I think this is why so many people struggle or think it's just their "genetics" holding them back. It can feel like absolute torture sometimes. Food addiction is real and needs to be treated as such. I wish you the best of luck and you're going to feel so damn good when you hit your goals, just be patient and persevere</p>

        <p>Ya weight loss is hard when you think that way. Also when you are surrounded by McDonald's and Starbucks..but really it's as easy as you make it. Don't expect to loose any weight shoving fast food in your mouth 3xs a week. </p>
<p>Food addiction is very real tho..most people don't realize just how addicting food is. But, again, a lot of good addiction is mental. I have been through food addiction and smoking addiction and have quit both cold turkey with horrible cravings and without any cravings. The mind is super funny</p>

        <p>Don't be so hard on yourself, you're doing the right thing trying to fix it. One step at a time and all that...very little that is easy brings any real satisfaction so it will take time.</p>
<p>Only thing I learned in my own struggles (not with weight) is don't compare yourself with others. The only comparison worth paying attention to is looking at you, today Vs you yesterday. Have you made a step forward today, that's all that matters and don't sweat the odd time you do slip up, everyone does it.</p>

        <p>To me, body positivity is accepting that not all of us are going to look perfect like models and not everyone will have the body of aquaman, and that's ok. Or like, someone with vitiligo shouldn't be made fun of, etc. But then it got co-opted into a disguise for overweight people to say "I don't want to change so I demand that society does instead". For people who supposedly love their bodies they sound pretty damn insecure</p>

        <p>To be fair, many of the "healthy" school lunches really aren't  so healthy. Especially when you take into consideration different dietary needs. And in the summer when fresh produce rots quickly, resulting in food waste and necessitating another trip to the grocery store, eating healthy can indeed cost more unless you grow your own food. Overly processed food might not be nearly as healthy, but you can stock up when you can afford to and it stays edible enough for weeks, months, or even years. I agree though, we need to normalize healthy bodies and stop glorifying disease.</p>

        <p>So I'm not American, however I have friends there, and also have looked up prices. Rice is healthy and cheap - you can buy several kg at a time and can make many meals for a family. In season produce is far cheaper or even frozen veg. Or buy in season and freeze. You can make far more filling meals for cheaper than junk food. You can buy smart and eat healthy for less than a diet of junk, it's possible (my friends who are not at all wealthy do so)</p>

        <p>&rt;We need to stop normalizing overweight and obese bodies, and instead normalize healthy bodies.</p>
<p>I agree, but I would add we also need to recognize what is healthy and what really isn't. There's still a very bad misconception that anyone who isn't skinny as a stick is unhealthy.</p>
<p>I've never been overweight, but I must admit I don't like to look at my body. I've gained 30 pounds... in 12 years. Went on a strict diet that worked to make me lose weight, but also made me sick.</p>

        <p>I’m a bigger girl and I am always conscious of this. Some times I have days where I don’t give a shit what goes in my mouth but most days I try to balance it. The last 5 months have seen will power take a back seat to comfort eating but never did I get so delusional to think I was still doing right by my body and immune system. I don’t have a problem with anyone telling me I need to lose weight. I need to lose weight.</p>
<p>The body positivity movement was started by people who can’t handle criticism or hard truths. They don’t ever want to think that they’re responsible for shitty situations they’re in regarding their physical health. And they definitely don’t want to acknowledge that they could be contributing to a negative covid outcome for themselves. It’s easier to blame someone else and act like a victim. And it’s destroying society.</p>

        <p>No beating myself up here! I have a level head about it. It’s the hottest time of year in Phoenix and with gyms still closed, it’s easy to write off exercise. Been making a plan of action for myself. I just think it’s good to be honest and realistic: I could be healthier, being overweight isn’t something to celebrate, I still have confidence unrelated to what I look like and people really need to take more personal responsibility for their situations rather than look to something like the body positivity movement to give them self esteem. Losing weight will be for me and me alone and being overweight is my problem and mine alone. It’s all about taking ownership!</p>

<p>At the start, I just took vitamin D supplements when I heard how covid was disproportionately affecting those with vitamin D deficiency. Now I’m taking vitamin D, C, zinc + a woman’s daily vitamin. Finally started grocery shopping and adding in far more fruits and veggies to my diet. Just gotta keep cutting down the sugar like a damned addict and up my exercise and I’ll be in a much better place!</p>

        <p>Sugar in my amateur opinion should be considered an addictive substance and it definitely shouldn’t and doesn’t need to be added to majority of our food products. And yet, if you’re like me when you grocery shop and you know how to read the labels, you understand the neigh impossibility of eliminating sugar from the diet in USA.</p>
<p>This could be due to the fact that sugar triggers a biological and especially neurological response not unlike cocaine, and therefore this addictive substance can boost the sales of any flavorless, overly processed product. </p>
<p>Going on off on a tangent here but here is a quick article about the ongoing scientific debate in regards to sugar being a dangerous and highly addictive substance. </p>

        <p>Not feeling guilty is a huge thing when it comes to food. It's a vicious cycle of eating, guilt after eating, eating again because of continued guilt. Not labeling foods as good or bad, eating because you are hungry and also being positive about your self image all helped me. But I also didn't lie to myself about my goal to loose weight. I would remind myself I want to put nutritious food in my body. </p>
<p>We put so much garbage in our bodies that it's scary. I saw on the news they were recalling some processed frozen foods because of plastic in them. I dont want to know what they put in food.</p>

        <p>I think the body positive movement started with good intentions. There are extremists on both sides.</p>
<p>I considered myself overweight at 122 at age 14, and for several years after, I was obsessed with getting my weight down to 90 (I'm 5'4") and I was envious of every thin girl I would pass (confession: I still am). I ended up going on a 500-calorie diet, which worked... and made me sick at the same time. I'm not obsessed with losing weight anymore, but I will admit I don't like to look at my stomach/waist (I gained 30 pounds in 12 years).</p>
<p>I think the body positive movement got hijacked by the people you describe. Sadly, that happens to every movement with good intentions.</p>

        <p>I'm in my 40s and, before this past March, I was losing weight.  I got a Fitbit and started walking a few miles during every lunch break at work.  I'm 6' and was closing in on 190.  Now I don't care.  I think I'm 220 right now.  I gained it all back and I've basically decided to intentionally eat like crap and not exercise in the hopes that I'll be dead by my early 50s.  My kids will be grown by that time and I honestly don't want to stick around here in clown world any longer than I have to.</p>

<p>And you don’t find this painfully ironic? Does this not clash with the mainstream rhetoric? Claiming to care about health while ignoring the science and making us sicker? Making fast food essential for God’s sake? I had a friend on FB who shamed people for questioning the essential status of fast food, saying that some people couldn’t cook. As if it’s impossible to learn how. But eating junk food is going to weaken your immune system, and making yourself more susceptible to the virus is technically considered to be manslaughter in this day and age, no?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXigmGZk5FU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXigmGZk5FU</a> </p>
<p>but u won't even be even told about that from a doctor :D</p>
<p>same applies to cancer, that has a whole list of treatments, where the FDA literally went to war basically to block them and ban them.</p>
<p>there are so many, whole documentaries are not even made about a single cure, but rather about a bunch of them and the fight against them, like this one:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bitchute.com/video/ZgBRnq7bIfA8/">https://www.bitchute.com/video/ZgBRnq7bIfA8/</a> </p>

<p>covid-19 fakedemic has nothing to do with health, but rather it is about sickness, programming, trauma, mind control,  digital dystopian tracking, power and mass murder (already just through deaths of despair).</p>
<p>we have treatments for the biggest killers, we even got well thought out and tested and safe measures to improve the overall health of the public and reduce the chance of dying from certain infections, like giving vitamin d during the winter on mass and having a campaign for that.</p>
<p>we know all that, but again it was never about health or safety, it is about slavery and sickness.</p>

<p>So, now ask yourself why it is that our masters won't spend $0 to save 8 million people, but were willing to trash the world for far fewer and most importantly, for people who will die this year anyway in the main?</p>

        <p>that’s funny when there is research that suggests it is contagious in the sense of when you are in an unhealthy environment and surrounded by unhealthy people with bad habits you can absorb that. it’s the energy exchange. if you don’t have a strong sense of self, discipline, or the tribal need to feel like you belong it’s very difficult. me personally i’ve struggled with my weight my entire life and outside influence/environment is a real factor. proud to say i’m no longer struggling i own being the freak that brings their own meal prepped food to gatherings and doesn’t indulge alongside friends and family, i realize my true authentic self doesn’t want to consume garbage or overeat.</p>

        <p>There were also places that began taxing the unhealthy foods as an experiment, can’t recall the exact place, but still, no one cared enough to spread the information. And yet, we can see from what’s happening on social media that they could pull it off easily.</p>

        <p>Don't they know that a large percentage of deaths are a result of complications from obesity? How selfish of them to want to keep sugary foods in production and have fast food still open. These people are taking up valuable hospital space and spiking up the cost of drugs for those with conditions that make them gain weight. How absolutely selfish and anti-science. /s</p>

        <p>I’m a little chubby. I drink.  I eat unhealthy foods. Quit smoking except the occasional cigar.  And I drink more.  If I was that scared, I wouldn’t do it.  Just like if I was afraid of Rona, I’d stay home.  Not expect everyone else to cater to me.  But these lockdown people don’t care about anyone’s health.  They just love the lockdowns.  They don’t need a reason.</p>

        <p>Obesity and it's related diseases that happen to be the leading causes of death in the USA kill far more people every single day than this virus ever could if it tried.</p>
<p>However, mentioning that the percentage of those overweight (around <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/obesity-overweight.htm">71.6%</a> ) and obese ( approx <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html">42.4%</a> ) and severely obese (9.2%) is a <strong><em>massive</em></strong> public health concern that is killing huge numbers of people and you're suddenly shaming those who were overnight/obese. How dare you! How dare you imply that weight is a health crisis! How dare you encourage personal responsibility to mitigate one's own weight and health! (Not saying it's easy please don't take it that way). How dare you point out modifiable risk factors that include being overweight/obese and other lifestyle factors. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/obesity-overweight.htm">Childhood</a> overweight and obese statistics are terrible, too, and pose far more a risk to kids than this virus. 20.6% of children and adolescents are obese that is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/childhood/index.html">1 in 5</a>, and 13.9% of 2-5 year olds, and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/childhood.html">20.6%</a> among 12-19 year olds. <a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/overweight-obesity#prevalence">1 in 7</a> or 6% have extreme obesity. Around <a href="https://www.ahealthieramerica.org/articles/facts-about-childhood-obesity-102">1 in 3</a> are <em>overweight</em> or obese. <strong><em>So the last thing that should be encouraged is children sitting indoors on devices, in a generation who may already have <a href="https://www.ahealthieramerica.org/articles/facts-about-childhood-obesity-102">lower life expectancy</a> than their parents</em></strong></p>
<p>I will only mention three leading causes of death related to obesity and lifestyle factors, the first being <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm">Heart disease</a> is the leading cause of death in the USA and kills over half a million people every year - 647,457 people, not too far from as many who have <em>supposedly</em> died worldwide from this virus. Someone in the USA dies every 37 seconds. It is largely preventable through lifestyle changes with risk factors being overweight/obesity, poor diet, physical inactivity, excessive alcohol use, and smoking. Heart disease also increases your risk when it comes to respiratory viruses... <strong>INCLUDING SARS-CoV-2</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/publications/factsheets/cancer.htm">Cancer</a> ends around 599,108 lives in the USA every year. Again, not too far off world-wide deaths for this virus. Leading risk factors for preventable cancers include overweight/obesity, as well as smoking and secondhand smoke exposure, excessive drinking, UV exposure. About 42% of <a href="https://www.cancer.org/latest-news/more-than-4-in-10-cancers-and-cancer-deaths-linked-to-modifiable-risk-factors.html">cancer diagnoses</a> and 45% of cancer deaths are linked to modifiable risk factors and are thus largely preventable - that's 4 in 10 cancers and deaths being preventable. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/facts.htm">Stroke</a> (cerebrovascular diseases) kills 146,383 per year in the USA and <em>disables</em> many more as it's a leading cause of long-term disability. 795,000 people have a stroke each year and 34% of those hospitalised are under 65 years old . Obesity alone is a major risk factor for stroke, including in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4458137/">young adults</a></p>
<p>Type 2 diabetes... The list goes on.</p>
<p>That's <em>a lot</em> of lives lost to largely preventable causes. No one is screaming about those, I wonder why? If people cared about lives...?</p>
<p>I will add- <strong><em>the body positivity movement was a mistake</em></strong>. Healthy at any size is a lie. Body positivity should be doing all you can to take care of your body, not just saying <em>oh I'm beautiful</em> when obese and not caring for your health. Not just rolling over and saying you're happy with your body when you're killing yourself. None if it is <strong><em>easy</em></strong>, weight loss and diet changes, exercise, all of that is hard. So please don't think I'm implying there's an easy fix, or that there aren't so many factors involved. I'm saying don't <em>normalise</em> and accept this, or pretend it is healthy.</p>
<p>Also, if it was about health and saving lives... ban smoking? Would save far more lives than anything else. Except people would freak out about freedom and personal choice... but they accept the hell that is shutdowns?</p>
