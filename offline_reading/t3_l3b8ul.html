    <strong>I don't believe the vaccines are intentionally bad</strong>
    <p><p>Hi all, I don't think whoever made the vaccines created them for the purpose of causing harm. Just that they are completely untested,  based on a never used technology for a virus we scarcely know anything about.  </p>
<p>Government use of fear mongering and the like to control population and gain power is just business as usual,  all governments do all the time is try to gain more power.  </p>
<p>I don't trust it,  I won't take it.  But don't think it was made to cause harm.</p></p>

        <p>If you were the regulator of food going inside of a country and the food producers didn't assure that the food is not posioned, would you allow it inside your country?</p>
<p>Well, this is exactly what it's been happening with the vax. So yes, it is intentional.</p>

        <p>Well of course. Vaccine is a product and as far as whomever produces it is concerned, it's primary purpose is to be sold with as large profit margin as possible. If it causes harm, it's a secondary thing. Nothing new here.</p>

        <p>2 months? I could inject patients with some radioactive stuff and in 2 months they wouldn't develop any symptoms. It would take years to do so. </p>
<p>This is why radioactive elements took so long to be considered dangerous. Needs a very long time to affect people. </p>
<p>We just know that in VERY short term, with a selected few people, from very specific groups, the chances of adverse reactions is relatively small.</p>

        <p>Do you think the vaccine contains radioactive material?
And to be correct. The tests started more than 2 months ago. Animal tests were started in August. And the people who tested it were not from specific groups. They had to test it on a variety of people (as it is regulated for every vaccine a pharmaceutical company wants to sell) and not like you say on a specific group.</p>

        <p>mRNA vaccines have been developed before but on vaccines we already had the “normal” one. Which means they weren’t as popular because there was vaccine 1.0 and no one wanted to really buy vaccine 2.0. That was for things like rabies and Ebola I believe. </p>
<p>Also COVID-19 is a new type of coronavirus. We have a blueprint of viruses similar which made that easier to produce a vaccine for. If you know how to make a grilled cheese then it’s not that much harder to make a melt, right? </p>
<p>Lastly, most countries that have complained that develop vaccines were green lighting production on the vaccine. Usually there is a lot of government red tape that prevents vaccines from being made faster. Or a lack of funding. But because these countries realized the virus is dangerous, they knew we were going to need something to fight it. Like how we fight the chicken pox or measles. </p>
<p>I understand being scared. You’re allowed to have those feelings. But i suggest looking into peer reviewed sources and not a Reddit dedicated to screaming about uncertainty or government control. I was scared too. It seemed too good to be true. I heard all about the nasty side effects and as someone who can’t move during a cold, that scared the life out of me. I finished my second dose about two weeks ago and my worst symptom was better than my colds. Of course each person is going to react differently but I went in with what I felt was my best knowledge and my desire to see the ones I love. I have a wedding soon. I wanted my grandmother in law to be there but she’s on chemo. She can’t be around us yet and we her unless we want to risk her immune system not being able to defend itself. So video calls work for now. The more people who get the vaccine, the faster we can get to old times.</p>
