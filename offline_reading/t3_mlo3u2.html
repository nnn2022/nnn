    <p><p>Hey guys, I am interested in the subreddit, mainly because I believe completely the opposite of what you suggest. Allow me to share couple of thoughts.</p>
<p>For now, let's choose to believe this virus is real, I don't think many people deny that. Let's also believe that it might not be that dangerous to many, as it really seems. But let's just decide that we need to get rid of it. </p>
<p>So lets imagine that if one gets sick, they might spread it for 2 weeks(?) and then they are recovered. So what if we just could keep every single person at home for 4 weeks, all over the world? Everyone who is sick, would either recover or die, and the remaining viruses would die off as well without host. Wouldn't this be the best? 4 weeks and then we are done, no more virus. </p>
<p>Well, obviously that is not realistic. Someone has to at least deliver food. Someone has to produce the food. Also people get sick for other reasons and need medical attention, so hospitals need to work. And power generation. And multiple other things. </p>
<p>So we cannot close everyone in their homes for 4 weeks, but why would we not take the next best thing? Close everything we can, for as long as needed and keep minimal count of people at work to make the system not collapse. </p>
<p>As someone who has been staying inside almost a year (except all restrictions were lifted here during june-aug, and yes, I have been outside anyway for walks, even with other people, not completely alone) it feels slightly frustrating. I would rather see that we close everything as realistically as we can, and see people screaming as loud as they can to <em>make sure the freedom is returned</em> after this is over. </p>
<p>Now it feels like we have those who live normally, and scream not to limit their freedom, effectively making the whole thing take longer (should we again belive that it goes away by complete lockdown).</p>
<p>I am well aware that staying inside for 4 weeks alone or without anyone but your family would cause various divorces, arguments and mental health issues, so again, not that straightforward. But 4 weeks (or whatever) would be way better that a whole year that we have had so far. </p>
<p>Another thought is very similar. There is this guy who owns a pub and he rages over facebook about the situation and that he should fight for the pub to be open. How about, close the pub and fight and rage for compensation. </p>
<p>Considering "new normal", I would like to see that it's no longer normal to be at work while sick. Especially here, when you can take unlimited sick days (depending on your job, after 1-5 days you need doctors note)  and especially as you get paid for sickdays, even though that's reduced pay. I would like to see that when you get flu, you immediately work remotely or take sick leave if possible, and not make the entire office sick, which would cause even more sick days for more people .</p>
<p>Rather long post, but what do you think? We can change the numbers if these are not realistic, but I'd like to know why these thoughts might be wrong.</p></p>

        <p>Okay, but what makes you think of that? Smallpox virus has been eradicated. </p>
<p>Do you mean that it cannot die because it's not alive in the first place? Virus is after all just a pathogen that replicates itself, given a suitable host.</p>

<p>But it’s all amazing. </p>

<p>Said media programmed fools do out of touch with reality it’s ludicrous. </p>
<p>How many people do you know who have died? </p>
<p>I know of one person who’s gotten sick. One. </p>

        <p>We seem to have different opinion about human rights and freedom.</p>
<p>Why would it be human right to hurt other people? If you have runny nose and couch, is it violation of your human rights to say that you should not visit nursing home where you'd potentially kill old people if they catch the same harmless disease as you have.</p>
<p>I especially enjoy the people who have such superior health, so they can live normally without fear of the virus as they would survive it anyway, but at same time they have "unspecified medical condition" which prohibits them from wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>Can you explain what is "deprogram"? How I feel like this is is equal to "make up your own reality based on 'research' that was written by an instagram model"? Real research is not based on opinions you find on the internet. </p>
<p>I don't own a tv as most content there is waste of money, and the whole concept of tv is obsolete.</p>

        <p>Smallpox is a lot different than a coronavirus. Viruses do go away but more so because their severity becomes lessened greatly by mutation and we live with it - it becomes endemic and is no longer a reason to freak out and close everything down. It might make fragile people sicker than normal, but the vast majority of the population can deal with it. Much like the regular flu.</p>
<p>For some reason though, people seem to think that this virus defies this likelihood and I’m not sure why.</p>

        <p>Mate this happened in Victoria, Australia. They had 350 cases per day. They done a full lockdown. It meant all businesses closed except for groceries. All construction shut down. You couldn’t leave your house unless it was for 1 hour of exercise per day and you had to wear a mask 100% of the time outside of your house. There was a 5km radius around your house that you couldn’t travel out of. They had police in check points. There was an 8pm curfew. You couldn’t visit a friend unless you were there to care for them. </p>
<p>That lockdown lasted 4 months to get it to zero. So your 4 weeks would do Jack shit. So with the amount of cases today it would be 4-6 months of this full lockdown and it still wouldn’t be guaranteed to work.</p>

        <p>Yes, my idea about 4 weeks was if everyone would literally just sleep inside their homes for that time. In real situations people need to eat and do some essential work, and naturally that causes some infections and makes the actual time longer.</p>

        <p>Why instead those who are vulnerable to disease shield and everyone else who are in very low risk continue on living? It's very selfish perspective to say "lock up everyone to save 0.3%" is it not? It's been over a year yet nothing changed. In my country, lithuania, we've been locked up since early November, completely, like they did in australia, but guess what? We're still under governments shoe, they still don't soften restrictions and grow their power with pushing fear and inflated numbers. How much longer do you need to be locked up to realize that it's not about the virus or saving lives mate? And where did it become my responsibility to care for others health? Everyone cares for their own health, asses their risks and go on live their lives, your sense of safety shouldn't cost my liberties. That's the end of it.</p>

        <p>The problem in my opinion isn’t the 4 week lock down per sé. Most of the usa was actually on board with that last year. The problem we have really seen is that people have become hyper aware that we are being guided by hypocritical politicians who break their own rules, or filthy rich millionaires who live on Disney land sized compounds, the MSM who has used this pandemic as a click bait strategy, and by scientists that have been caught lying about the virus origin on camera in trying to defend the CCP... ALL of this together has made the average person reluctant to give up any more freedom what’s so ever because the trust has been completely erroded and bastardized.</p>

        <p>If it was just 4 weeks that would be one thing, problem is it’s NEVER just 4 weeks. The tendency of government is to always get as much power as possible. Plus as u said, u can never completely lockdown. And it is a reality that u can never completely eradicate a virus, especially one that it as contagious as this one. I noticed that u mentioned smallpox being eradicated. It’s not impossible to eradicate. But for a virus that has a 99.5% survival rate for everyone under 70, it doesn’t make sense.</p>

        <p>It's hard equation to balance.</p>
<p>Again feel free to challenge my assumptions, but a lot seems to do with health care capacity. There are limited number or ICU beds. If by a magic wand you could infect every single person on earth right now with all the virus variants, would you do it? Most people would survive without even noticing any symptoms, or have a runny nose for a couple of days. Many people, possibly millions would die, mostly old and those with pre-existing conditions. After this we could get back to normal, with the "best people" remaining. So, sacrifice lives in order to make the world better.</p>

        <p>I definitely wouldn’t do that. That would be a bad course of action. I propose letting the virus run its natural course, infecting a large amount of people over a period of time. Not everyone will catch it, just like not everyone will catch the flue. Lockdowns and other measures don’t work to significantly slow the virus, so why destroy people’s lives? I’m sure you know the obvious examples of Florida and Sweden.</p>

        <p>Hi! Healthcare worker here.  You should probably know that hospitals were complete ghost towns for a while, and the only "surge" I saw was due to delayed care - "elective" procedures and tests that weren't allowed to occur under the governments orders.  Needless pain and suffering and advancement of disease that could have been mitigated if only we weren't playing political football.  We had empty field hospitals built that went untouched.  In my city, an old VA hospital was also converted into a covid hospital and never used.  Most of the "covid hospitalizations" are not pure covid cases, but rather people who tested positive or were presumed to be a positive case (based on "potential exposure), but we're actually in for other things.</p>
<p>To answer your other questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>I don't support policies which put people into poverty.  Poverty kills.</li>
<li>I don't support policies which delay necessary medical care.</li>
<li>I don't support policies which require social isolation, as it well documented that social isolation leads to poorer health outcomes and obviously has significant ramifications on mental health.</li>
<li>I don't support policies which infringe upon basic human rights.</li>
<li>I don't support policies which have no actual scientific basis.  There is an article out there called "The untold story of social distancing." Basically we are all guinea pigs for a disease mitigation method that was dreamed up from a 13 year old's homework assignment.  Seriously, look it up.  </li>
</ol>
<p>We literally took the WHO pandemic playbook, which strongly advised AGAINST the very measures we have implemented, and threw the whole thing out the window.  We then actively censored, discredited, and stripped licenses from any scientist or healthcare professional who spoke out. </p>
<p>Science requires discussion, space for disagreement, and space for alternative hypotheses.  None of this has been allowed to happen.</p>

        <p>Yeah, thats what I tried to imply. But how close to actual lockdowns have there been in any country? Even during the most strict mask recommendations and "max 6 people" limitations which are the strictest measures that we have, stores are some times crowded, people seem to not care about safe distances and people seem to party at home and visit other towns that dont have restrictions.</p>
<p>Now, if we draw the conclusion that these restrictions were not effective, we should first make sure that did anyone even try to follow them.</p>

        <p>You said it yourself, a true full out lockdown is impossible.  People need food, water, supplies, medical care, etc.  A society also needs tradesman to deal with repairs - what happens if your toilet breaks or your power goes out?  People that need to travel for work need gas in their cars and/or access to public transport.  So you need fuel station attendants and train conductors/bus drivers.</p>
<p>And what resource do people need to pay for all of these necessities? Money. How do people get money? Jobs.</p>
<p>What happens if, during the 4 weeks of extreme lockdown, your employer goes bankrupt and you lose your job?  How will you pay for necessities?  </p>
<p>Finally, what happens when you force people into isolation for even a modest amount of time?  Major mental health issues.  This has been proven time and again by studies of prisoners in solitary confinement.</p>
<p>So essentially you are advocating for population wide isolation, which <em>will</em> - not might, <em>WILL</em> - lead to a major population wide mental health crises. </p>
<p>So by locking down you're adding a crisis on top of an existing one - and have failed to solve the first crisis by locking down on the first place.</p>

        <p>Why insult like that? Can you even read? </p>
<p>Did anyone do a lockdown where 100% of people had to stay inside 100% of the time? I don't think so, as I said that would not be possible, so we could try to aim for next best thing. All places with lockdown did not limit people from seeing each other, which caused thr virus to spread. </p>
<p>Money has to come somewhere, so it comes where it usually comes: a country takes a loan from a bank, ie. public debt. Most countries have billions of public debt, which can never be paid back. Public dept is not same as individual debt, which is what people often do not realize.</p>
<p>For the sake of argument, U.S. Puböic debt seems to be 4.49 trillion. Lets make ~350 million people stay literally inside for 2 months (about 8 weeks) for 1000 dollars a month to buy food. That would cost 0.7 trillion. Yes, that is a lot of money, but for a country like U. S. It's not that much.</p>
<p>Again, if you are unable to understand: No, not realistic. No, some people need to at least deliver food, make food, grow food.</p>
<p>But the original question is: why not go with the next best thing, which would that people would actually limit their contacts. I'm my country they have these recommendations about safe distances, masks, etc., but I just can't understand: huge portion of people do not care about the recommendations, the virus spreads more and more, and then the government is surprised that things are bot working. Of course those are not working, if people do not even try.</p>

        <p>I've read your entire post, including the part where you advocate for locking up as many people as possible so society doesn't fall apart for as long as it takes the virus to die. That's just stupid and if you're insulted by that, you should reflect on why it's stupid. NZ has supposedly eradicated the virus multiple times only for it to suddenly appear. </p>
<p>Also look up hyperinflation. In my country we had a similar situation before with bananamoney, that's why we know just printing money doesn't work and it's a STUPID proposal. Let me say that again, it's DUMB AS FUCK. And not every country is the US with its GDP and capital. So be smart next time</p>

        <p>Nah, I just picked on the "naive or stupid" -part.</p>
<p>I can understand that many people would not be happy if they are locked in for extended periods of time and this would cause huge mental health issues.</p>
<p>I just feel that most who oppose staying at home are just loud people who would not get any problems from that, as the common argument seems to be about personal fReEdoM.</p>

        <p>Do you live with your parents? </p>
<p>Many people do NOT live with their parents or other relatives or even their significant others or friends or some people may be divorced and only see their children on weekends. Some live by themselves, alone in a rented apartment in a city. Migrant workers do this as well. You are telling these people to stay at home, not see their elderly parents who may die before the lockdown is even lifted, not see their signifcant others, children, friends etc or just stay alone in their apartments. For how long? A lot longer than 4 weeks, it's so long that no one can give an accurate number how long it'll be. </p>
<p>This is why you're naive and stupid.</p>

        <p>No I do not live with my parents.</p>
<p>I am how ever capable of using this rather simple device called "phone" and also there is a "computer" and "webcam" that I can use to contact people, which I do on daily basis. </p>
<p>Seeing parents can arranged while having minimal contacts, people self-quarantine here before visiting old relatives. Seeing couple of friends occasionally can also fit in the restrictions. Seeing your significant other that lives in their own place is not forbidden.</p>
<p>What's the problem? I clearly said in my original post, that it's impossible to have 100% lockdown, why not aim for next best thing? </p>
<p>Minimal contacts does not mean to have large gatherings with multiple friends, or seeing different set of people every day, or a having dinner with relatives or other families, or a party with multiple people.</p>
<p>Again, my original post I was just proposing the idea, that if the virus takes certain time ot incubate, then for couple of weeks you are sick and contagious, and then it's gone. Would it not be great, if we could separate every single person from everyone else for this period of time, as the virus would effectively be gone after that, as it would be physically impossible for it to find a new host. Every host would be isolated, and would either die or recover. No more cases after that.</p>
<p>I baffles me that anyone in this thread took the idea literally, as I clearly said it's not realistic. I suggested that we try to aim for the next best thing.</p>
<p>People who can work remotely, should do that. Most of people I know do. People who cannot work remotely, will not. Now we have minimal people at work. Then, let's try to limit the contacts. Only see some of the people you know, the most important people. We're now having a good start. </p>
<p>Believe me, I'm looking forward to get back to my hobbies, which can not be done if places are closed. I just wish that more people tried to achieve that, and would stop spreading these conspiracy theories about the situation.</p>

        <p>Because this is what you said "So we cannot close everyone in their homes for 4 weeks, but why would we not take the next best thing? Close everything we can, for as long as needed and keep minimal count of people at work to make the system not collapse.
"</p>
<p>It's a bit too late to pretend you were only acting retarded when you literally said close everything we can and keep only minimal people at work</p>
<p>I mean dude, I'm from asia AND chinese but even I comprehend basic english while you don't seem to even UNDERSTAND what you wrote. Even now you write "Would it not be great, if we could separate every single person from everyone else for this period of time, as the virus would effectively be gone after that, as it would be physically impossible for it to find a new host.

<p>Do you EVEN understand english?</p>
<p>Especially since multiple countries made it illegal to visit people from other houses for multiple months, so basically what you were suggesting which you didn't even bother to research apparently. Yet those countries still have covid.</p>

        <p>I'm not acting retarted. Have you any idea that we can discuss things without really wanting to implement them? We can propose ideas without actually supporting them. I can also suggest, that let's just continue life normally everywhere, that's what many people seem to want. Problem solved? No, we most consider if that is a good idea first. Most likely there are no good solutions. Each solution is equally bad in different ways, opening everything is bad  and closing everything is bad. I came here to understand why people seem to be so obsessed about the whole conspiracy theory, so let's have a good discussion from both points of view.</p>
<p>Close everything that we can and keep only minimal people at work. That's what I'm suggesting? What's the problem? We can fit "necessary contacts for mental health" into this.</p>
<p>Try to learn communication skills. Instead of saying that "you did not bother research" you should just tell me that "<em>multiple countries made it illegal, including countries a,b and c, here is the source and here is discussion and analysis how it went</em>". The point of a discussion or argument is not to "win" or figure out who knows less. No need to be rude.</p>

        <p>Yeah, that's why I said it was a bit too late to pretend you were only acting retarded. It's an implication that you're NOT acting. Seriously. Do you comprehend english?</p>
<p>I have communication skills. But it requires you to understand english. So my advice is try to learn english because if you want to debate on a majority english-speaking sub, you're going to need a better comprehension of english. Maybe you should have used your 1 year staying at home to learn that instead</p>
<p>And there were multiple problems wrong with that. Because a) you have no time frame so you're dooming people to limbo of not seeing people. You're also killing off businesses because again, you have no time frame.</p>
<p>I mean, your plan is doomed to fail because you have no clue how to start. Let's say you have necessary contacts. What's a necessary contact? Parents? Children? What about siblings? Then what about the people living alone as migrant workers? They have no family there, so I guess we'll just weld them at home until the time is up. Or can friends be included? Oh, friends can be included, then I guess it's time to include friends as well for the people with families. Secondly, who's overseeing this? Who is going to say to citizens, okay you need to be stopped, I need to know who you're going to see and if he's a necessary contact?</p>
<p>Also, the fact you're a social recluse is a telling sign that you don't understand the benefits of in person socialisation. Not everything can be done with a phone and over zoom. Maybe you should learn to socialise with people in person</p>

        <p>&rt;Well, obviously that is not realistic. Someone has to at least deliver food. Someone has to produce the food. Also people get sick for other reasons and need medical attention, so hospitals need to work. And power generation. And multiple other things.</p>
<p>You identified the problem right there. That's why "lockdown" will never work to halt transmission or eradicate the virus. As long as someone comes into contact with someone else from outside their home, there will be transmission. Then the "essential" worker goes home and passes it to the people they live with. And to say that they could just wear a mask and stay separated in their own house wouldn't work. Not everyone knows or even understands how to disinfect and avoid transmission in close contact.</p>
<p>But, if you want to <em>assume</em> lockdowns work to stop virus transmission (a very large assumption considering their track record). It would have to be a complete and total shutdown. All essential workers would have to stay at their work and not be allowed to go home. People would have to be forcefully kept under house arrest. The military would have to patrol every street and arrest or shoot on sight anyone who set foot outside their house. If someone had a medical emergency they would have to be kept at the hospital for the rest of the lockdown. You can quickly see in a free country this would never be allowed. People have rights that you can't just take away because it's an "emergency". A shutdown like I just described could never happen.</p>
<p>So, if there's no way the government can legally force people to stay inside their houses and your strategy is to get people to do these things voluntarily, it won't work. Unless compliance is enforced with severe punishments like being shot on sight if you're spotted breaking the rules, you won't get full participation (even then you might not). There will always be people who are unwilling to comply, no matter how much you tell them it's necessary. It's just human nature that for a variety of reasons, some people refuse to follow the crowd. That's why, even if lockdowns could work in an ideal world, they will never work in the real world.</p>
<p>Now why don't our leaders realize this? If your plan to stop the virus will only work if ~100% of people participate, you need a new plan. I think the people in power are intelligent enough to know this, which is why I (along with probably most of the people in this sub) don't think these "lockdowns"/"shutdowns" are about stopping the virus. This is about them seizing an opportunity, to gain more power over our lives (as well as other motives). Those who have power always want more.</p>
<p>Long comment, but what do you think? I apologize if it became repetitive.</p>

        <p>4 weeks huh? 4 weeks? I’m almost 100% certain all us non-compliers did “4 weeks”.  <br>
I believed it was all a stupid farce but I went along at first to make it go away. In fact, it was about 4 weeks before I noticed other people defying the restrictions and I said That’s enough, this is insane and all the lockdown is doing is prolonging the virus. </p>
<p>Another thing: it is not realistic to even expect a two week compliance. Do you know why we have police forces in every city, state, country, even in rural areas? </p>
<p>Because there are <em>always</em> people who are breaking the law, everywhere:  drug abuse, theft, kidnapping, assault, etc. These kind of people aren’t going to suddenly and magically decide to care about society. In fact, these types are going to take advantage of those “4 weeks” if they can.</p>

        <p>Peru already tried that. Months of full quarantine right when the pandemic started. Only people working in essential businesses were allowed to work, for which you needed a pass. Soldiers were in the streets. Most people were allowed out once a day to buy food or medicine. At one point they even had restrictions for days that woman and men could go out. Absolutely no one was allowed out on Sunday (except health workers I guess). Masks have always been mandatory when you're outside your home. Social gatherings have been illegal for over a year now. The list could go on. The cases did not go drastically down. After a while they realized that this wasn't feasible. There are millions of people in Peru who live on what they make day to day. There are families who don't have anything to eat and depend on donations from the government or private sources (ollas comunes). Poverty was hard enough before all of this happened. It's always the poor who suffer the most. It seems to me that most people who are in favor of lockdowns are people with the means to withstand the lockdown. If lockdowns worked, Peru should be doing quite well.</p>
