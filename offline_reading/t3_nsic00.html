    <strong>Do people seriously think the "2019 normal" is actually coming back? 😂😂😂</strong>
    <p><p>I've seen plenty of blind optimism this year, but this is the most hilarious one, where people actually think "things can go back to normal". So let's break this down:</p>
<p>Even after all the investigations currently happening (implying foul play), and the shady events of 2020-2021, I see some people on the main coronavirus subreddit STILL posting stuff like "I got vaccinated, I want my 2019 life back", not realizing that now the governments have seen how fucking EASY it was to have the masses comply (literally a few weeks into 2020 March, and it was already changed forever), what makes people think they won't try again with another future Crisis to consolidate more power? After everything that has transpired... how can they seriously think "2019 normal" is just going to come back that easily?</p>
<p>Sure, the hysteria is dying down (I've seen plenty defying the mandates), but "2019 normal" is gone either forever or for a very long time (think after-9/11 and before-9/11, same logic applies.) its not going to be fast, after the propaganda has trained the masses to be fearful of other people (except for the skeptics like us)</p>
<p>In fact, even if things did revert back to 2019 normal, that would also mean being oblivious to all the corruption unlike in 2021, so in a way, at least you're not going in blind unlike before, which actually makes this a good thing.</p>
<p>Even now, the World Economic Forum was already talking about a cyber attack, then coincidentally the amount of cyber attacks have increased... they're already ramping up another possible crisis (look into cyber polygon, July 9, 2021, similar to event 201 pandemic simulation from October / November 2019)</p>
<p>Now, I'm not saying its impossible, but don't count on it.</p></p>

        <p>You are correct. Things are never going back to pre-2019. They will keep inventing new viruses - genius because they're invisible so we're just to take their word for it and everyone will panic and get their masks out again. This thing has caused irreversible permanent damage to society. I never bought into it so never masked, tested, vaxed but majority of people were roped into it. The manipulation is staggering that they have now convinced people things will return to normal if 70% of people take the shots. They've been lying since the first day, why trust them?</p>

        <p>In the UK, we were told lockdown would be for "two weeks" and then it would be reviewed - then after two weeks we were told it would be another "two weeks" and then another review - then they started talking about a "road map" to get us out of lockdown - and it was at that point that I realised we would <em>never</em> go back to normal - and more than a year later we are still wandering around in the wilderness of this "road map" with no exit in sight.</p>

        <p>People actually do.  I do not.  The whole point of the Covid situation is a quantum political transformation- something that in the US was fairly steadily underway until 2016/2017.</p>
<p>It was dealt a four year setback and we're in many respects experiencing "catch-up mode".  Crisis is a tool for transformation.  Expect more to be rolled out with increasing regularity- with health being a frequent theme.</p>
<p>Just my theory.</p>

        <p>Adults, especially the young &amp; middleaged adults are <strong>loving</strong> these lockdowns (this is in Ireland) they shout down anyone daring to disobey the <em>rules</em>, and believe everything any 'expert' or official says.
Now the govt is 'predicting' a <strong>FOURTH WAVE</strong> and virtually everyone is buying it w/o question.
Lockdown in Ireland is completely normalised, many really do not care if it never ends😫</p>

        <p>I think a lot of people are saying we re getting closer to normal but I disagree.  People also thought that last spring/summer but then we all went into lockdown for 6 months. I think we are actually in a very bad place with the separation and vilifying of the non vaccinated. Next winter it will be worse with health passes and passports already in place.  And furthermore inflation could bring economics chaos and another crisis the governments will "save" us from..  Don't let your guards down, peeps. When we have no masks, no threats of lockdowns, no segregation, no mandatory vaccine for colleges, open travel anywhere, and probably more stuff im missin just now, then we can consider we are back to normal.</p>

        <p>I think it's financial collapse.</p>
<p>Money has been printed through debt in amounts that are beyond comprehension to the normal human. We're still in the 2008 crisis but its been extended through furious quantitative easing (printing of money through debt). Your cash is worth less and less every month.</p>
<p>This pandemic is the perfect blame for it. Bankers get away with it (again) and politicians can be blamed for the financial crisis through lockdowns. I reckon meat won't be affordable anymore (hence the push for us to eat bugs) and houses will only be rented. Furlough will continue into a UBI digital version of your currency where the value can be directly controlled by the issuer. One day you'll be able to afford meat one day of the week and the next it's bug soup for the rest of the week. Now they have complete and utter control through vaccines that weaken the immune system thus people rely on big pharma more and more and they control your spending. China is already doing it and the west will follow.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if I fear the people in charge of this more or the people that mindlessly follow such blatant propaganda, it bewilders me that you see someone going "take the jab" on TV for a split second and think that it's the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to my rant.</p>

        <p>So, how about this one; in the past, the American population has been slightly more resilient to governmental harassment. The revolution, the civil war (whether or not you agree with why, people still stood up), and even farther out than those two examples. Why have Americans become so docile?</p>

        <p>&rt;<strong>”The use of fear of disease had been one of the first approaches to public goodwill adopted by Rockefeller and he knew it to be effective.</strong> Since then it has become standard and accepted practise among the conspirators, even in radical circles. Thus <strong>the Russian Communists offered as an excuse for the invasion of Rumania, statistics that were designed to show "an appalling prevalence of endemic diseases" in Bessarabia.</strong> The Communists propose, in the words of one commentator, that "if Rumania will not treat the needlessly ill with Communism, Russia will cure them with bombs."</p>
