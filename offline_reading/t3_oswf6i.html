    <strong>The idiocy is astounding</strong>
    <p><p>Took my daughter to the orthodontist today. They are still requiring masks and temperature checks. So there are two women at the entrance doing this. We get our masks and stickers showing we don't have a fever. Go upstairs to the office and the big waiting area has hardly any chairs in it so that people can "socially distance". Then on the other side of the short wall the chairs are all normal close together. Sitting here in the waiting room with my disposable mask hanging on one ear. </p>
<p>All this, plus every single woman at the front desk is touching her mask/face as I walk by. Either adjusting it or just resting that way.</p></p>

        <p>Speaking about stupid things: where I live, at malls there are free thermometers to check your temperature. Last year there were security guards checking it, nowadays nobody gives a shit anymore, yet many people still stop to have a temperature reading.
The funny thing is that some weeks ago I had a dental surgery and I felt some fever. I told myself I go to the mall pharmacy to see if they have some aspirin.
I checked the temperature at the entrance and it read 36.4Â°C (normal).  Half hour later I checked it again at home and it was 37.8 (moderate). This for saying, that crap is useless as fuck.</p>

        <p>Especially useless now that they admit the PCR test are completely unreliable and most of the cvd cases were probably just flu.</p>
