    <strong>Research complete. Returning to base.</strong>
    <p><p>Howdy all! Before you start reading, a big thank you to everyone taking the time to do so.</p>
<p>I'm not very well-known around these parts, but its fair to say that I hold a different opinion to many people here with regards to everything happening these days.</p>
<p>However, I consider myself an open-minded type so came here to listen to the other side of the argument and see what merit there is in it. I'd love to be able to discuss more with you guys, but Reddit's internal systems make it difficult for someone in my situation (regularly receiving low karma) to engage fully.</p>
<p>That being said, I'm going to leave here as I think I've found all the research I need to either dislodge some misconceptions I've made in some areas and re-affirm my belief in others.</p>
<p>So, I'd like to run down the opinion I came in with on certain topics and let you know what's changed and what's remained the same, giving reasons for each.</p>
<p>Ok let's go...</p>
<p>-</p>
<p><strong>Initial Opinion #1:</strong> Covid-19 is real.</p>
<p>One thing I couldn't understand is people saying that the virus doesn't exist and it was all a conspiracy. Everyone is bemoaning the lockdowns and, in spite of the world governments enforcing them, they're acutely aware that people are dissatisfied and wouldn't do so if they at least think they're doing the right thing.</p>
<p><strong>New Opinion #1:</strong> Covid-19 is real.</p>
<p>As much as some may be annoyed, nothing on this thread has really convinced me otherwise of this matter. Sorry.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p><strong>Initial Opinion #2</strong>: Wearing a mask stops you spreading Covid-19.</p>
<p>A lot of people have the misconception that wearing a mask prevents you from catching the virus and redditors have pointed that out as the "silver bullet" against them. However, I've known for a while that the mask never stopped you from catching it, but it did stop you from spreading it.</p>
<p><strong>New Opinion #2</strong>: Wearing a SINGLE mask REDUCES THE CHANCE OF you spreading Covid-19.</p>
<p>For the most part, my opinion is unchanged, however two things to point out are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>people have the perceived notion that whether someone wears a mask or not determines how safe they're being but, no, there are other ways of staying safe, such as going out less and keeping your distance.</li>
<li>the concept of wearing multiple masks at the same time to "increase protection" is stupid. If one mask isn't enough, make better masks.</li>
</ol>
<p>-</p>
<p><strong>Initial Opinion #3:</strong> Wearing a mask at all times when outside is important.</p>
<p>The research I've taken into whether or not masks are beneficial to me found no real evidence, but it did indicate that it limits spreading Covid-19 to others. With the added information that some people have the virus with no identifiable symptoms means that it was important to protect others for the reason to end the lockdowns faster.</p>
<p><strong>New Opinion #3:</strong> Wearing a mask when outside the house AND INSIDE BUILDINGS is necessary.</p>
<p>You'll note I changed the word "important" to "necessary". The reason for this is that masks aren't nearly as safe as people claim them to be; they make a difference, yes, but not a great difference. I say it's necessary due to my nation in particular either limiting service or issuing fines for non-compliance, so it's necessary to avoid a wallet-puncture if nothing else.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p><strong>Initial Opinion #4</strong>: The vaccines are safe.</p>
<p>I'm a very big advocate for the use of vaccines and strongly condemn anyone in the anti-vax movement. As much as I believe in the rights of liberty and free speech, I've been looking for someone somewhere to give me a good counter-argument against vaccines, but no such luck. The covid-19 vaccines are no different.</p>
<p><strong>New Opinion #4</strong>: The vaccines are safe ENOUGH.</p>
<p>The different vaccines have a differing level of efficiency and some claim that they were developed too fast. On the surface, that's true and the numbers don't look good. However, after researching the testing that has taken place, I'm personally reassured that, while it was fast, it was in depth enough to be beneficial. Even a vaccine that's 99.999% effective when given to 1,000,000 people still only has a 0.00004% chance of successfully immunising everyone so any vaccine is guaranteed to fail eventually, Covid related or not.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p><strong>Initial Opinion #5</strong>: People who don't support the lockdowns are idiots.</p>
<p>And now for the opinion that made me realise I'd gone too far. Yes, at one point, I would look at people not wearing masks and parading in the streets and think "you're the reason this lockdown lasts so damn long". While that was a shocking opinion, it was what finally made me realise that I was being too close-minded about this and an investigation was needed, which led me to...</p>
<p><strong>New Opinion #5</strong>: There are idiots on both sides of the argument, and intellect on both sides too.</p>
<p>A lot of times when I've given an opinion, it's gone down like a lead bloon. Other times, I would engage with well-spoken, passionate individuals who clearly know their stuff and would provide great insight into alternate viewpoints, so these could be the most significant opinion change I've got here.</p>
<p>What confirmed the other part of this is that, despite me regularly getting ridiculed on this forum, I was banned from r/CovidVaccinated for the sole crime of posting here where anyone who did the research into what I said would know better and this please never did ban me. In that instance,</p>
<p>r/NoNewNormal 1-0 r/CovidVaccinated</p>
<p>-</p>
<p><strong>Initial Opinion #6</strong>: The number of deaths is shocking.</p>
<p>The headlines of the outbreak paint a truly bleak picture of the death that the outbreak has caused and I was very upset by it. Until I realised...</p>
<p><strong>New Opinion #6</strong>: The number of deaths is bad, but misleading.</p>
<p>The BBC indicates that "within 28 days for any reason" stipulation, but do the media companies? Nope. Upon realising that, I take the death count with a pinch of salt now and focus more on infection rates as that paints a clearer picutre in my opinion.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p><strong>Initial Opinion #7:</strong> The biggest enemies of r/NoNewNormal is the world governments.</p>
<p>From the initial conversations I had and the general tone of the posts, there was a lot, A LOT of anti-government posturing, particularly aimed at Boris Johnson and Joe Biden. I've always thought that being in the government in these times is an unwinnable situation and still think that, but can understand why they'd be the scapegoats here.</p>
<p><strong>New Opinion #7</strong>: The biggest enemies of r/NoNewNormal is the media.</p>
<p>Despite everything they've done to annoy us, we can at least claim that the government are trying to do the right thing. Failing, but trying. I cannot say the same for the media, who's primary purpose is to engage the public with fearmongering and propaganda. The right-wing media companies in particular are nefarious in their approach and it's made me very skeptical of all of the media, leaving me very few sources I actually trust.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p><strong>Initial Opinion #8</strong>: The stop the NHS being overwhelmed, lockdowns were necessary.</p>
<p>Controversial one this. I believed before coming here that lockdowns were a good idea and important to stop the spread. However, it is important to note that I was virtually immune to lockdowns as I had two jobs, both still active during the lockdown, and live far away from my family so not much changed on a personal level.</p>
<p><strong>New Opinion #8</strong>: While the NHS would've been under more pressure without a lockdown, the lockdown caused more problems; more money should've been pumped into the NHS instead to increase capacities. Either that or greater financial packages should be available.</p>
<p>This is the hardest to summarise as my opinion on lockdowns went from "absolutely yes" to an incredibly murky jumble of thoughts that, when written down, never seem to feel right. What I wrote above is the closest I can get to making sense of it all.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>And, that's it.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this and for your engagement with me during my time here. As I go, I hope everyone here stays safe and healthy however you approach the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p>Goodbye!</p></p>

<p>Used to work with a fella, he was non stop.</p>
<p>Someone referred to him as "Wobblegob".</p>
<p>I asked "Why do you call him wobblegob".</p>

        <p>I'm sorry that I came across that way as I was being genuine.</p>
<p>I really did come here with the intention of having my opinion changed and it happened with mixed success. Some opinions completed changed, some waivered and others stayed as is.</p>
<p>I apologise if I come across as a troll.</p>

        <p>Yep I have.</p>
<p>What's important is being able to be receptive to other opinions. That's why I came here.</p>
<p>I now feel confident enough in my opinions about Covid-19 and all the trimmings that no-one from either side of the fence can change my mind now and it's thanks to r/NoNewNormal that I gained that perspective.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

        <p>I worded myself poorly...</p>
<p>Being receptive to an opinion means being willing to consider an opinion and I am willing to consider opinions.</p>
<p>What I was trying to say is that, unless some earth-shattering evidence comes to life, I feel comfortable in considering the opinions of others but still disagreeing with said opinion.</p>
<p>Does that make sense? I feel like that didn't make sense...</p>
