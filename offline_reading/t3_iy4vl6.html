    <strong>Blaming 196,000 deaths on Trump? Did anyone see this?</strong>
    <p><p>I logged into Facebook unusually often over the last weekend. I have been avoiding it because of all the virtue signaling. I saw a bunch of different memes that tried to blame Trump for all the covid deaths. Here’s the insanely weird part - all those memes are gone from my feed. I even checked some friends’ profiles and couldn’t find them. </p>
<p>It’s so incredibly stupid to blame anyone for deaths from a virus unless they purposely infected people, like blankets infected with smallpox or Cuomo and nursing homes. Otherwise, humans cannot control viruses. It’s just so incredibly stupid. I’m glad the memes are gone. It’s the bots, right? </p>
<p>Disclaimer: Trump is an awful person and should never have even run for President. In previous campaigns,  nobody would have taken him seriously. He is not qualified. SMH. There are one or two things I’ve agreed with, but that’s with any president.</p></p>

        <p>Not sure what's awful, especially compared to Hillary, but I guess everyone has a right to their own opinion.</p>

        <p>"everyone has a right to their own opinion" - this is correct , but that rule doesn't seem to apply with regard to the current president.</p>
<p>it seems the swamp knows no bounds when trying to protect itself</p>

        <p>the only thing Trump can do in the united states, is let the states govern themselves OR declare Marshall law.</p>
<p>his opponents were and are poised to exploit either, regardless of truth or facts .</p>
<p>it's so transparent and i believe largely ineffective , i can only hope no one is falling for it.</p>
<p>the 200k little flags stunt, the CDC already published the truth and if the MSM and dems what to keep floating lies i don't think it will go well for them.</p>
<p>where are the 70K flags from last years flu ?</p>
