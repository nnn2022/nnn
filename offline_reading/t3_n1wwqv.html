    <strong>I feel the need to update my friends here: I got the first shot of Pfizer yesterday.</strong>
    <p><p>So, as post says, this is my favorite sub here on Dreddit, and I've been a member since it began (under a previous alias, similar to my current one).  I try to contribute where I can, but mostly, I just sit and steam about where the world, and America, is currently.</p>
<p>My wife and I, both of us 45, and totally healthy otherwise, got the first shot, yesterday.  I was 99% against it, but I'm not anti-vax.  I get a flu shot every year.  I monitor my health and sports performance (ride bicycles semi-competitively) closely.  I know when something is "off" or different.  We have both remained free of illness over the past year plus.  But, she convinced me.  She convinced me as SO's will often do.  I told her I would get the vaccine ONLY because she is willing to do so, but I wanted to know WHY she was willing, when she shares many of my beliefs about this new world we live in.</p>
<p>She said that getting the vaccine just aligns with what we normally do, well before COVID, to protect our health.  I countered that the flu vaccine is time-tested, and side effects are KNOWN.  She came back with "we aren't early" with this vaccine, now.  Many have chosen to go through with it, including my slightly more liberal, but naïve, 21 year old daughter, who has had both shots.</p>
<p>So, rest assured, my mind HAS NOT CHANGED about these new normal practices of big pharma/government/media.  I'll not be posting to social media, other than here, IN THIS SUB, about my now-vaccinated status.  This isn't a fucking trophy that I earned.  I don't need to virtue signal about SHIT, and I won't.  </p>
<p>But, I love my daughters, my wife, and I want them to have a father and husband that will be firm in his beliefs, but malleable to change, to a low extent.  </p>
<p>BTW, my arm where I took the vaccine had a little stiffness in the muscle for a few hours.  But, I hit the gym this morning, like I always do, and lifted HEAVIER with my arms than I intended to do.  I wanted to see anything that felt "off".  All good, here.</p></p>

        <p>Good on you. This sub is about promoting the concept of choice, not bashing people for their choices. People can determine for themselves whether or not to get vaccinated. There are always risks either way. I am also getting vaccinated, by my own choice. No one pushed me into it. However, I would never push anyone else to do anything medical, including getting any vaccines (or not getting them). Fuck anyone who judges you for it.</p>

        <p>Four months in to a new medical treatment, when these usually take 5-7 YEARS to approve and still have occasional failures after that IS EARLY.</p>
<p>Did you get the swine flu vaccine in 2009?  Same story, same players, same risk.  The volume and number of people screaming at you does not, it turns out, correlate to the validity of their claims.</p>

        <p>yea that's my concern... I totally support people doing whatever the hell they want with their bodies IF they are completely aware of the side effects and risks.</p>

        <p>And if this were a serious disease or I were at serious risk, it would be a challenging decision.  As it is, when I and my family are healthy (and almost certainly exposed repeatedly already) a vaccine with possible side effects isn't worth ANY risk.</p>

        <p>as much as i disagree with you admittedly relenting for no good reason whatsoever (the position is <em>not</em> grounded in reasoning or empirical data, but rather emotions), i very much appreciate how you articulated your ideas, and that you will not pathetically virtue signal or brow beat others.</p>
<p>well done. i hope you don’t feel any ill effects, short or long term, of vaccine toxicity.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your thoughtful comment, as opposed to a few of the 12 year olds here.  I appreciate your assessment of my description of the thought process behind getting jabbed.</p>
<p>And, spot on: I don't give two shits who does or doesn't get the vaccine.  It's not a "badge of courage".  It's something of a personal decision, and Lord knows it likely won't be the WORST decision I ever make, or have made.  If I grow a third arm, I won't have a reason to bitch when I'm working on my car anymore :D.  If I die, then it's been nice knowing most of you, and that my mindset of how the world has turned, is shared by many.</p>

        <p>I do t think there’s anything g wrong with people getting the vaccine, if you want to get it go ahead. I just personally want to wait for there to me more long term data, and would maybe take it once it’s FDA approved and not experimental. My mother was vaccinated and was fine, she asked my why I’m not getting it and I told her the same thing, I want to wait til it’s FDA approved. I don’t rip on them or anyone getting it. The main thing is it being your choice and not being forced. I will only make fun of people virtue signaling about it because they deserve it lol. Hope you stay well brother</p>

        <p>I get it. You lack faith in your own immune system and believe that drug companies can make your immune system better than the original that's been fighting off all sorts of pathogens for the past 200,000 years? ok..... go ahead and trust the science, I will take a pass.</p>
