    <strong>Got a burst of hope today!</strong>
    <p><p>Going to dinner with family down by Fort Lauderdale Beach, FL. See people everywhere, almost no masks, people on the beach and in the restaurants having a grand old time! So happy to finally see some degree of normalcy again!</p></p>

        <p>I experienced the same in a suburb of Phoenix today! Every table that could be filled at the restaurant was full. Lots of people walking the sidewalks outside. People wearing masks but it seemed like a lot of people were half assing it just so someone wouldn’t give them shit for it. The thing that’s a big give away to me is traffic. It’s the same if not more dense than a year ago and all these people can’t possibly just be going to the grocery store. Life is being lived.</p>

        <p>Sorry, but I tend to...take these posts with a huge grain of salt.</p>
<p>I've seen people at LDS claim that Pennsylvania, particularly my county, has "zero masks, no social distancing, everyone having an amazing time" at malls, and other places like that. I never see anything like this in PA (what I see: everyone in masks, everyone paranoid and keeping six feet apart, people looking miserable and afraid, and so on). I see the exact opposite. Same in NJ and DE, which people also claim have all that same stuff, aka "no masks, etc".  </p>
<p>I wonder if people make these sort of claims just to cheer others up and "give hope" to this sub. Or maybe they just happen to be out at times when this happens (even though I've been going out frequently lately).</p>

        <p>Oh, I get it. It is a Saturday, so it might because it’s Saturday night, but it’s a lot more people than I expected. Plus, cases in FL have begun to plateau, so I have a push of hope that things are beginning to turn around.</p>

        <p>Yeah your post reflects what I would say closely. Like where I live, I went hiking recently and almost like 2/3 of people and their kids were wearing masks. In a state park/hiking trail. Most the people not wearing them were the ones that went higher up the trails. People do not realize even the official recommendations say "6 ft and 15 minutes". Like walking past someone outdoors for two seconds doesn't require a mask even by the strictest standards.</p>

        <p>I’ve gotten in numerous arguments on other subs over wearing a mask while hiking outside. You have to be a special kind of brainwashed to believe wearing a mask outside while hiking is actually doing anything. That the virus is just going to jump from one person to the next in the half a second you pass someone on a trail.</p>

        <p>I was at my local state park on July 4th, my estimate was that about 1 in 4 were wearing masks.  That includes the crowded picnicking area by the water, where I'd say it was 1 in 6.  I didn't see any of the disc golfers wearing masks either.</p>
<p>I guess though that Wolf has ordered more restrictions since then?  I'll have to go back to the park next weekend.</p>

        <p>I'm from PA, affluent bedroom community near Philly,  and I'll agree, it's pretty miserable with fear. </p>
<p>But! We are down in Brigantine at the Jersey shore and it's been incredible!  NJ is in a tighter lockdown than PA, yet out of the hundreds and hundreds of people I've seen on the beach or walking around town, I saw maybe 10 people in masks, and three of those gave the appearance of having potential comorbidities. Oh yeah of course there were masks on in stores but that was about it. None of the people eating and drinking at outdoor restaurant seating were wearing them, they don't have to - I could see the masks getting yanked off the moment they were seated. </p>
<p>Waiting to pick up takeout food I struck up conversations with several different people. Since I wasn't inside I wasn't muzzled. I'd lead off with something like  "man, I am <em>so done</em> with this crap." Not ranting, just making conversation. Two agreed enthusiastically,  one nodded politely, but no one came back at me.</p>
<p>People out in the fresh air and sunlight knew intuitively that there's almost no risk.</p>

        <p>I’ve yet to see any place in NJ without masks or people disregarding the guidelines. I went to the boardwalk and it was like 85% masked and miserable. Entire families were walking around together all masked up and paranoid, like why even bother. People here are extremely paranoid and into Covid guidelines, no hope here. This area has likely fully adopted this as their new normal that won’t change. </p>
<p>I think these posts may be a way for people to cope, honestly. I’ve noticed a lot of these types of posts lately and all I can say is the reality in my area doesn’t give me any hope.</p>

        <p>Was at non socially distanced beach packed with people and no masks at all, even in a "required" setting. I don't want to name my city to not dox myself. But it's in "north" north America 😊 I do believe people are done with the virus exaggerations especially as the vaunted fatalities failed to materialize. They will not be able to impose a second lock down here Imo.</p>

        <p>Today was a pretty good day.</p>
<p>I walked into Publix without a mask on and they said “ we’re legally supposed to tell you to put on a mask, so if you have one put it on your chin.”</p>
<p>Then I went to a graduation party for a friend and someone gave me the first handshake I’ve had since March.</p>
<p>Then I went to my little brother’s little league baseball game with about 1,000 people in the complex and only saw one mask.</p>
<p>Today was a good day.</p>

        <p>Going to get together with two friends for one of our birthdays at her house for snacks. The mother is a nurse tho and a controlfreak and is very much like “oh we shouldnt be in a room with non-family people for longer than 1 hour cause pArTiClEs and vIrUssss”. And even before the virus she just used to kick us out the house at dome point. 
So I imagine its gonna be a short meet up. 
Ugh so sick and tired of this.</p>
