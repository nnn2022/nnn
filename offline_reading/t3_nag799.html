        <p>To elaborate for the doomers, the entire pharma industry is built on profit. It's more profitable to treat symptoms than find cures. If you think big pharma cares about your health, ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>How come taking a full bottle of pills will kill you, but taking one a day is healthy?</li>
<li>How come a side-effect of anti-depressants is suicidal thoughts?</li>
<li>How come we closed the gyms and limited outdoor exercise during a health emergency?</li>
<li>How come we've seen huge increases in cancer, autism and obesity over the last century?</li>
<li>How come spraying poison on our food kills insects, but is fine for humans?</li>
</ul>
<p>How about we stop treating symptoms and start actually living healthily, like we're supposed to? Our immune systems have always worked, so why aren't we putting them to use? We should be optimising them, not destroying them.</p>
<p><a href="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fm0.joe.co.uk%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F04%2F24165327%2Fmaaaaa.jpg&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1">McDonald's after 10 years</a> - If not even microorganisms will dig into something, it's probably not food - it's junk. Stop eating junk like a human trash compactor. Here's some guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whole, natural, organic foods is best.</li>
<li>The more processed, the worse it is for you.</li>
<li>If you need stimulants like caffeine, you're not getting enough energy from your food.</li>
<li>Poisoning yourself isn't a reward, neither is eating junk.</li>
<li>Calories are not identical - 500kcal of cake =/= 500kcal of fruit.</li>
<li>Practise seeing food as fuel instead of entertainment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, cravings are simply your subconscious mind trying to return to its old ways of self-sabotage to fit in with the people around you. Surround yourself with healthy people, and your subconscious will copy them.</p>

        <p>Excellent, excellent post! </p>
<p>As a long time worker in the mental health field, with lots of interaction with pharma, and their reps, I can assure you, it's a dark, shady, and underhanded culture, and not one to be trusted. I can also vouch for how the ENTIRE mental health system (in addition to the physical health system) is designed to keep people imprisoned in their mental health crises, so they keep drawing those Medicaid dollars, and distributing them to the various companies. It's all about the money, both for Big Pharma, and the Medical, and Mental Health fields, at least at the corporate level.</p>

        <p>I worked for a mental health clinic for a while. It was entertaining to watch for look of disappointment on a new drug rep's face when she would find out that the psychiatrist is not only female, but better looking than most of the reps. </p>
<p>I mean, it's funny how every other job in outside sales and pharmacology is dominated by men, but going to the clinics to push a new, higher profit version of the drug with an expiring patent is 99% very attractive, 20-35 year old women.</p>

        <p>Anti-vaxx or anti a specific vaccine that was created hastily? I haven’t seen anyone here telling people not to get vaccinated against polio  or MMR. The only anti-vaccine posts I’ve seen have had to do with the particular set of covid shots that have been created in a worryingly short amount of time and are currently being tested for efficacy in the general population</p>

        <p>the reason it was created so quickly was because a lot of the typical red tape you can expect from testing a new vaccine was removed and also there was a massive amount of collaboration between scientists around the world. Do you have any real reason to doubt the efficacy of the vaccine other than “it was made too quickly” (which isn’t even a valid reason).  You know hundreds of millions of people have already received the vaccine right lol?</p>

        <p>And because it was created so quickly the long term effects aren't known. Ontario just banned giving out the first shot of AZ to anyone else because it's so dangerous, J&amp;J has been shut down in a lot of places too. I would rather deal with potential long term effects of a flu variant than potential long term effects of an experimental compound produced by a company that has never, and still doesn't, have a single FDA approved drug. If you think the vaccine is worth the risk then I absolutely think you should have the right to get it. But don't pretend like everyone who doesn't agree with out is an idiot, it closes your mind off and will harm your growth. I understand you probably like to be surrounded by people who only agree with you, but you'll benefit a ton if you open your mind and try to learn about the world.</p>

        <p>There is a very noticeable difference between physically assaulting somebody, and not wanted to get injected with an experimental drug with recorded and severe reactions. Once again you have failed to intelligently address a single point I made in any comment, so I'm genuinely going to hope that you're just a bored troll and this isn't actually a reflection of your intelligence. Also it's very telling you won't even mention your education, you definitely come off as a Karen with a pHD in googling so I'd say your trolling has been successful in that regard </p>
<p>I have researched this, both with my peers in the medical industry and through scientific papers, but you are more than welcome to believe what the first result on google tells you. I'm going to stop wasting time making intelligent arguments to someone that's either trolling or that is genuinely mentally challenged as that's a lose lose scenario. Once again I'll say the same thing - if you are able to address a single one of my points in an intelligent and rational manner I will happily continue to have a discussion with you, because unlike you I'm not afraid of new ideas and conversations with people I don't agree with. However I feel like your reading comprehension will fall a bit short and you'll just end up rambling off something idiotic in an attempt to be inflammatory and I'll just end up ignoring you. Either way wish you all the best in your personal and intellectual growth, troll or not</p>

        <p>.0017% of people who have received the COVID vaccine have died, and scientists have not found a casual link with taking the vaccine and dying. However, COVID has a global mortality rate of about 3%, a figure much much larger. And the 3% doesn’t include the lifetime complications someone can have from getting Covid and recovering. My credentials shouldn’t matter, and if you’ve ever actually taken a philosophy or rhetoric class you’d know that discrediting me because you think I don’t have any actually is an ad hominem.</p>

        <p>And seeing how 0.2% of covid deaths are from people in my age range, that would work out to max a 0.006% chance of me dying if I contract the virus. As well the deaths from covid are linked extremely stongly to comorbidities. As a very healthy young adult my risk of death contracting covid would be significantly lower than 0.006%, as between 85-90% of deaths occur in patients with a comorbidity. And these are all calculated using official government numbers, which have been proven to not be completely accurate.</p>
<p>Covid may have long lasting health effects, but I would rather take a risk with long term effects from a flu variant than a highly experimental drug produced with lessened oversight, lowered testing requirements, and made by a company that has never had an FDA approved drug. </p>
<p>And the idea you're thinking of would be far better described as an appeal to authority, not an ad hominem. Which you're also wrong about. If I was saying I'm correct because I'm much more educated in these topics that would be an appeal to authority. Which I haven't done a single time. I was asking about your education level to give context to the conversation and how in depth I can go. Maybe you should try out one of those philosophy or rhetoric classes? I have taken several excellent ones, as well as technical writing courses for my published papers, so if you would like a recommendation I would be happy to help.</p>

        <p>Nice projection, but seeing as how I just made that exact point doesn't mean much. And no, that isn't an ad hominem either because it's directly related to the topic at hand. An ad hominem attack is if I said something about your character as opposed to your position, which you indicated is based on googling. I've been published in the Texas Journal of Science for a paper related to the production of demuslification chemicals in oil and gas, as well as listed as an author in the BC Medical Journal for work I did in biochemical engineering having to do with 3D printing cellular structures. If you consider those quack sciences, I would love to hear the more reputable papers that you've had published. </p>
<p>So if I get the vaccine I can't spread the virus correct? That's news to me and I appreciate you informing me of that. If getting the vaccine means it's impossible for me to spread to others that would be a strong point in your argument, and would make me much more likely to get vaccinated. Can you show me your source that indicates getting the vaccine stops you from spreading it?</p>

        <p>Not impossible, but reduces the chance greatly. The current vaccines have about a 94% effective rate, which I’m sure you knew. Less chance of you contracting it means less chance of spread as well.</p>

        <p>So if you don't contract it does that mean you're unable to spread it? The resources I've read seem to indicate that they know you can spread it even after your vaccination, but they think it'll make it less likely. But that all appears to be based on hunches, as I can't find any studies or articles that explain why they believe it'll be less likely. Wouldn't it be a much easier and safer solution for those who are at high risk to be vaccinated so they can't contract it? Then they can weigh the risks of the vaccine vs the risk of catching covid and make an informed decision for themselves. While I can make an informed decision not to get it? Then those elderly and very sick you mentioned would be protected, even if walking around unvaccinated can spread it.</p>

        <p>Exercise is a natural human activity. Your eyes face forwards (I assume); you're a predator; you're supposed to run for your food. The body has natural ways of telling you to stop - exhaustion, pain, stitches.</p>
<p>Pills aren't something we've evolved to take. It takes hours to die of heatstroke, with your body constantly telling you to stop once it gets dangerous. It can take minutes to die of overdose.</p>
<p>Furthermore, exercise is a linear process. You run, and keep running, and keep running, and eventually you die of heatstroke. With pills, you can take as many as you like and digest them in the same amount of time.</p>

        <p>Some do have benefits, some don't. Giving kids Ritalin mostly isn't beneficial to them, the guy who founded ADHD even said "ADHD is a prime example of a fictitious disease." It's just an easy way for kids who aren't cut for classroom learning or are going through problems at home to be used to create a quick buck for big pharma.</p>
<p>Almost all of the things we take pills for can be fixed naturally. I'd keep painkillers and antibiotics, for instance. But depression can be fixed - imagine you don't like your life and it gradually declines your mental health until you're depressed, and then you're given pills so you can continue with the life you hate - treating symptoms, not causes.</p>
<p>Symptom relief medications mostly won't be needed if everyone slept long enough and ate a nutritious diet. In my experience, every time I've been sick, it's because of either a lack of sleep or a poor diet.</p>

        <p>&rt;How coming taking a full bottle of pills will kill you, but taking one a day is healthy?</p>
<p>Because the amount is important. Water is required for life but too much will kill you. Too much oxygen will kill you. Too much of anything will kill you. </p>
<p>Its the same principle of why you might add a little bit of vanilla extract to a batch of brownies. It helps make the brownies better, but if you add too much it's going to ruin the brownies. Dosage is important with all things, not just medication. </p>
<p>&rt;How come a side-effect of anti-depressants is suicidal thoughts?</p>
<p>You are correct, suicidal thoughts are a possible side-effect of anti-depressants. They increase your energy and motivation levels when you are depressed, which can lead to suicidal thoughts before your feelings of depression have lifted. It is not a universal side-effect and it's more common with some types of anti-depressants than with others. It's also not guaranteed than anyone who experiences suicidal thoughts as a side-effect will act on them. </p>
<p>Anti-depressants have a perfectly valid medical use but they are only given by prescription because of their potential to be abused. </p>
<p>&rt;How come we closed the gyms and limited outdoor exercise during a health emergency?</p>
<p>Because touching equipment that is potentially covered in someone else's bodily fluids is a quick way to get infected during a pandemic. Even if machines are perfectly sanitized there's still a high possibility of getting infected when you're indoors and surrounded by people breathing heavily and not wearing masks. There's no issue with exercising outdoors so long as you maintain social distancing. People are still encouraged to exercise, just not at gyms. You can absolutely work out at home, even with no equipment. </p>
<p>&rt;How come we've seen huge increases in cancer, autism and obesity over the last century?</p>
<p>The primary reason cancer rates have increased is because of increased life expectancy. Over 3 quarters of people diagnosed with cancer are over 60 years old. Through most of history, people rarely lived to be that old. Another reason is that we have the ability to detect and diagnose many illnesses now that we previously couldn't, which is the same reason autism is being diagnosed more. </p>
<p>The reason autism is seen as more common now is not because a higher percentage of people have autism, it's because more people who have autism are being diagnosed. </p>
<p>Obesity is definitely a major health issue today that is rapidly increasing. The reason is that many people in developed countries have quick and easy access to as much food as they could possibly want. Moderation is important and it's easy to become addicted to eating. </p>
<p>It's a difficult addiction to fight as it can't be avoided. While you can avoid cigarettes or alcohol, someone with a food addiction can't just stop eating. It's a serious issue that needs to be addressed. </p>
<p>&rt;How come spraying poison on our food kills insects, but is fine for humans?</p>
<p>Because something that's poisonous to one thing may not be poisonous to another. Chocolate and grapes are both perfectly fine to eat for humans but will kill dogs. Not all pesticides are the same and they are reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the EPA. </p>
<p>Part of the EPA's reviewal process to approve pesticides is the potential risk they pose to humans. When a pesticide is approved the EPA sets limits on how the pesticide may be used, how often it may be used, any protective clothing that must be worn when using the pesticide, etc.</p>

<p>That's either impossible, or impressive. Your bodily defense against over-eating is the feeling of fullness, vomit, pain, etc. Pills aren't natural so we don't have a defense mechanism.</p>
<p>&rt;Because antidepressants can increase energy and motivation levels, which may be very low while people are depressed</p>
<p>So they have the motivation to kill themselves? Why don't we opt for natural ways of fixing our mental health that don't increase the risk of suicide and make big pharma filthy rich?</p>
<p>Like eating healthily, surrounding yourself with positivity, spending time with friends, hell a freaking visit to a dog home would make most people feel better. Why aren't these things subsidised and organised?</p>
<p>&rt;Because they cause contact between strangers, which spreads plague.</p>
<p>Indoor gyms, perhaps, but we've had outdoor restrictions too. Here's a <a href="https://odysee.com/@The-Dollar-Vigilante:6/Man-Arrested-Standing-Up-For-His-Wife-Dollar-Vigilante-1:4?r=4EE4CBPKVetA7qe1xQ983S3NFkMU8y55">man being kidnapped</a> for walking outside with nobody around but his grieving wife. There's many, many examples of this.</p>
<p>&rt;Cancer it's because the vast majority of formerly deadly illnesses are now very treatable, leaving just a few poorly treatable that kill almost everyone.</p>
<p>I suppose that played a part, as well as more accessible screening, but <a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-us/cancer-news/press-release/2015-02-04-1-in-2-people-in-the-uk-will-get-cancer">50% of people</a> in the UK will now get cancer in their lifetimes. I think that's still a big increase.</p>
<p>That link states, "more than 60 per cent of all cases diagnosed in people aged over 65." Average life span is around 80 in developed countries so around 40% of cancer occurs in people around 15 years from the expected age of death.</p>
<p>&rt;Autism it's because it was never diagnosed over a century ago as no one had ever scientifically documented the correlated pattern of symptoms.</p>
<p>I don't know much about this one, all I know is it's really been on the rise.</p>
<p>&rt;Obesity is because advances in technology have enormously increased food output.</p>
<p>It's not just the output, it's the type of food. You're hungry a few hours after eatig a 1,000kcal McDonald's, but not after a 1,000kcal grilled steak. You can fit more junk calories in your stomach than whole calories.</p>
<p>&rt;The dose makes the poison, and insects don't always tolerate the same dose as people.</p>
<p>At the same time, insects don't eat the poison every day for decades. My first point in this comment applies here too.</p>

<p>You can apply this counter-argument to literally anything. How come stretching is good for you, but rotating your neck 360 degrees will kill you? How come meditation is good, but meditating for five days straight will kill you? How come fasting is good, but fasting for ten years will kill you?</p>
<p>They're irrelevant because you can digest ten pills in the same time it takes to digest one pill, and your body has no way of stopping you. Pills aren't natural, we aren't naturally supposed to consume anything that we can so easily overdose on.</p>

<p>Yeah thats the idea. Everything in moderation. Pills aren't some special exception, and being "unnatural" doesn't make them bad for you just like being "natural" doesn't make them good for you. </p>
<p>&rt; we aren't supposed to consume anything we can so easily overdose on</p>

<p>How come some salt is necessary to survive, yet too much will kill you??</p>

        <p>1) There are therapeutic doses of drugs. Drinking too much water at once can kill you, drinking it daily is healthy, similar concept. 
2) A part of depression is not being able to get up out of bed and do things. Unfortunately, antidepressants motivate you to start doing things and being productive, but can some people the desire to end it. 
3) I don’t think any reputable health care provider is going to tell you to exercise less. Gyms were closed just to try to reduce the spread of COVID. Kind of a cost-benefit analysis situation; are more people going to die or have long term health complication from not exercising in gyms or by catching covid from the gym. I don’t believe in the closures but thats the reasoning. 
4) Due to advancements in medicine, people are living longer. The older you are the more likely you are to develop cancer. Probably pollutants from big companies fucking us as well but the fact that people are living longer lives is a big driver of the increase in cancer rates. Autism is just more diagnosed now, many people in the past were undiagnosed. 
5) This kinda goes back to #1, dosage. Insects are a lot smaller than us, meaning a small amount of poison does a lot more damage to them than us. Another thing is insects are built differently from us, so we can target something specific to them and not present in humans when making bug spray. Pesticides are kind of a necessary evil for the mass production of food.</p>

<p>We evolved to drink water, whereas modern medicine is foreign. Your body tells you to stop drinking water through pain, it doesn't have a way of stopping you taking ten pills at once.</p>
<p>&rt;Unfortunately, antidepressants motivate you to start doing things and being productive, but can some people the desire to end it.</p>
<p>If the medical industry wasn't profit-driven, it would have better ways of treating depression. Currently, it goes: Life sucks for a long time, mental health declines, depression sets in, take pill, continue with sucky life but without the emotions.</p>
<p>That's treating the symptom. Treating the cause would be to improve your life.</p>
<p>&rt;Gyms were closed just to try to reduce the spread of COVID.</p>
<p>It's not just the gyms, it's the outdoors too, even when you're not near anyone.

<p>Good points, I still think there's been a rise in cancer caused by all the chemicals we use - eating junk, cleaning products, skin products, EMF radiation, pesticides, herbicides, GMO, fluoride, Teflon pans, etc. etc. etc.</p>
<p>&rt;Insects are a lot smaller than us, meaning a small amount of poison does a lot more damage to them than us.</p>
<p>One dose might kill insects and be harmless to us, but we eat the food every day for decades so it must add up.</p>

<p>So why is it that everyone who says this has either a jug of 0% ultra-skim "milk" or a carton of whitened soy juice pretending to be milk in their fridge?  Usually right next to the block of congealed, flavored and colored oil because butter isn't processed enough for them either.</p>

        <p>I just wanna answer one fallacy in this. The rest was pretty accurate.
The reason cancer and autism rates have gone up is because more people are getting tested. I wasn't diagnosed with autism until 2011 when I was 14 because while I had all the symptoms, it wasn't widely known or tested for. My grandpa acts the same as me, and now he's sure he has always had autism, but they always just labeled him as a "weird kid" not diagnosed autistic. 
With cancer, back in the day, people just got sick and died, they didn't check for cancer. 
For those last two points, the answer is the same as why the Covid numbers kept going up, more people getting tested. People who refuse to give their kid the polio vaccine use the same logical fallacy to relate vaccines to autism. It's, quite frankly, a bullshit argument, unlike the current situation we are in where we are questioning a rushed, non approved vaccine for a virus that isn't deadly to the overwhelming majority of the population. </p>
<p>You last point about obesity can 100% be explained by two things:</p>
<h1>1. Increasing portion sizes over the last century.</h1>
<h1>2. Increased access to energy dense, nutrient scarce food (eg. fast food, frozen food).</h1>
<p>(optional) #3. The USA's food pyramid is total bullshit, not accurate, and needs to be updated.</p>
<p>We are on the same team, but I feel like I can't let misinformation be spread in an echo chamber. We can't be like the other side who doesn't call out their kind when obvious lies are being shared, leading to them all repeating the same fake news.</p>

        <p>A major issue is that most med schools spend a negligible amount of time teaching disease prevention. Doctors are woefully prepared to educate patients on how to prevent illness. They have very poor understanding of nutrition and, unless your doctor is physically active...which most aren’t, they don’t have a good grasp on the fitness side of things either. The best they can do is throw disease management at the patient. Once you hit that point, you’re already behind the eight ball. </p>
<p>Which medical professionals shouldn’t take all the blame, these patients know they’re living a very poor lifestyle. Unfortunately, the doctor they trust to put them on the right track promises them to fix it with a synthetic drug instead of giving them the proper education on how to take some responsibility and fix it without meds.</p>

        <p>Oh I see. I had understood what he said as "as long as you exercise and eat healthy food you'll be fine." while also downplaying the massive benefit synthetic drugs have been able to provide. But I guess he was only saying that about anything not specifically asked about. Which actually makes since considering health is a far more complex topic than diet and exercise could explain alone.</p>

        <p>You are absolutely right in both of those regards. Still. Health is a complex topic and no one should pretend the diet and exercise are the sole components. Nor should anyone downplay the massive benefits technology has played in our increase lifespan. Even if there are organizations out there benefiting from addictions to some of those medicines.</p>

        <p>So you’re trying to make the exception the rule?</p>
<p>“Diet and exercise aren’t effective because a small fraction of the population may have a genetic heart defect.” </p>
<p>That’s not how it works. The overarching theme for the US health situation is a lack of exercise, poor diet, and personal apathy. It doesn’t take long working in the medical field to become jaded towards the attitude of the general population toward their own health. They just want a pill, or ten, and no burden on themselves. Sorry if that offends you, but it’s true.</p>

        <p>I'll agree there is a fitness and diet issue, but don't sit there and pretend that's the only solution that'll keep the nation healthy. Health is a complex topic and suggesting  diet and exercise are the only factors is at best ignorant. Doing so while downplaying the important role medicine has played is also ignorant. In fact, obesity kills an estimated 350k people per year in a country that saw 2.8 million deaths in 2017. Here's a source https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db355.htm</p>

        <p>I also included personal apathy. I work with people day in and day out that do not manage their hypertension, obesity and diabetes. That leads to more complex issues such as heart failure and end stage renal disease with dialysis becoming necessary. If these people had managed their lifestyle early on, their life would look much different. </p>
<p>I’m not suggesting that diet and exercise are the only two components. Some people are born with sucky genetics. It’s a bad situation and it happens. I’m glad there are medicines out there to make their lives more manageable. There have been advances in medicine that are remarkable, the issue is people see medicine as a get out of jail free card. Can’t count how many times I’ve heard diabetics talk about eating the donut because: “I’ll just take more insulin later.” </p>
<p>Your obesity stat is interesting. How many cancer and heart disease deaths do you think are hastened because of obesity? Not sure you can put a number on that, but I’m sure it’s not negligible.</p>
