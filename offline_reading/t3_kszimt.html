    <strong>The Covid will soon disappear, but only for a brief moment...</strong>
    <p><p>Now that the election has been successfully stolen and Joseph Biden will soon take office, Corona pandemic is going to dissipate.</p>
<p>We will probably have to deal with a hardcore lock down and national mask mandate. During the ensuing upheaval, they will slow down testing, ramp up vaccinations and deaths and cases will quietly go back to being classified using precovid standards. We will see a substantial decrease in the numbers for both. </p>
<p>We will be given a couple of months of normalcy. Joey Biden will be hailed as a hero. And, just when everyone settles back into life, boom, a new covid strain or an entirely new virus will start spreading across the globe.</p>
<p>And, because the Joe Biden lock down and national mask mandate got rid of the original pandemic, we will be forced into another lock down, everyone will have to put masks back on, new vaccines will be rushed to market and the demoralization will continue.</p>
<p>Lots to look forward to.</p></p>

        <p>I agree. I think the first part of what OP said is true - Biden will have his “nationwide mask mandate” (which really means nothing, as I don’t see the states that still don’t have a mandate suddenly changing their mind for Biden), and after a month or two, numbers will start getting better and Biden will be credited with “winning the battle against Covid”. But I don’t see this happening again next winter. Maybe I’m being optimistic but look how low compliance is even in places like CA now. I do think people are over it, it’s just no one is really speaking out against it.</p>

        <p>I do agree with you on everything you've said but either it'll play off where after everyone has received their vaxx that we go back to a somewhat normal (no lockdowns but masks and social distancing stays) and in 2025 SPARS makes the scene or they try to keep us locked down until then by saying there are new variants etc</p>

        <p>Scary as shit -- I just wonder, "why"? What's the nefarious end-game? Why would JB want to lock the place down again? You think he will be swept up in more hysteria? Other than some who say that Xi Jinping is behind the West's implosion, I'm not really sure what the country has to gain in the long run or the short run with repeated lockdowns.</p>
<p>It is impressive, actually, how Fauci and others have just shrugged off the "new variant" -- gives me some semblance of hope....that Biden will claim a victory because we won't be counting the whatever-the-f's that we have been counting ...</p>

        <p>I, too, think the COVID scare will likely die down, but it could take until spring to start to see it.  Of course, credit will be given to our new Shitlords, and the vaccine, but just the warmth of spring and less time indoors will have an impact on numbers reported, starting in the south, then moving northward, as the warmth of good old Mother Nature, doing what she does, takes over.  No government or science intervention needed.</p>
<p>My trouble is, so much damage has already been done.  Hatred has been fueled, and media is still going to do their thing, as well.  America changed from this, and not for the better.  I, myself, feel I aged about 10 years this past 12 months.  It took a lot out of me.  Gone are my dreams of something beyond my normal day to day.  Now, it's work, sleep (or attempt to), work, sleep.  That's it.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your kind words. Very descriptive and energetic. Pretty unoriginal though. I think my 3 year old said something similar to me yesterday but, I do appreciate the effort.</p>
<p>Now, I just read my original post and I can't find the word "OVER" anywhere, slap dick. Over? We're just getting started. I said we are going to see a short break in the action, after being put through a strict lock down and a nationwide mask thing. They will start dialing back the testing and cases and deaths will be counted differently. This will make it appear as though the lock down, masks and the new fake ruler saved humanity. And, the lock downs, masks and vaccines will forever be justified whenever someone sneezes in the grocery store.</p>
<p>A second pandemic or some such shit will soon follow. A new strain of vid, a new virus, a bioweapon, who knows but, something is on deck. And, the demoralization, the ushering in of the bio-patriot act, will continue.</p>
<p>Fucking over? I never said over. I didn't even hint at the possibility. This way of life has just started. Anyone who stands up against it will be called a bio-terrorist. The WHO just made sure of that. Buckle up, cupcake. </p>
<p>And, when the coming lock down starts, why don't you spend some of that time working on those reading comprehension skills?</p>

        <p>On the election; For me, I saw four or five important swing states just stop counting late Nov 3rd. Nearly every other state managed to finish on time, except these. Then over 2-3 days, they found enough votes to turn the result. That by itself is highly suspicous but not proof - but then in PA, there were something like 2 counties where 100% of voters voted.. only those two. I believe this is unheard of in any election ever. The way the trends went, as analyzed by statisticans, the article I read said if you flipped a coin 100 times, it would be like getting heads all 100 times. And they urged to only look into these counties further. The states response: “Stay out of our business”. All of the sudden people don’t wanr to trust the Science anymore... These states would not audit their results, they would not match signatures on the envelopes to the actual vote. Or signatures on the ballet to the registered voter. In some cases I heard they “lost” the envelopes. This election was a joke. I could have signed my ballot as Santa Claus and it would have been counted. Or someone could have never sent it to me and signed it for me late night Nov 3rd. The MSM and social media instantly shut down anyone who even suggested skepticism. These are just the reasons I know of. To top it off, could you even imagine what would be being said right now if Trump won under the same circumstances?</p>

        <p>I think the case for a stolen election is strong without evidence. </p>
<p>Assuming the average Democrat isn't an inhuman monster, they do literally think Trump is Hitler, and minor process crimes (registering an illegal, falsifying a signature, running a stack of ballots twice, etc) are possible, why would you ever assume there wasn't voter fraud? It is possible and morally justified, so it happened at on some scale.</p>
<p>The question of whether it was sufficient to change the election is answered by the refusal to confirm that it didn't, especially after calls for audits and evidence of sufficient potential fraud by the voter integrity project to sway the election. </p>
<p>In this hypothetical world of no fraud, when millions of people cry fraud and simple checks could dissuade at least a portion, the response would have been to hear the evidence, and likely to reject almost all if not all of it after investigation. Instead, the resources of the FBI are directed at protestors by the party that actively resists voter ID after all concerns are dismissed on procedural grounds.</p>
