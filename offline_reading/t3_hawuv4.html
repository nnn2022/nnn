    <strong>Why The News Is Not The Truth In The " New Normal "</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://hbr.org/1995/05/why-the-news-is-not-the-truth">https://hbr.org/1995/05/why-the-news-is-not-the-truth</a> </p>
<p>A classic 1995 article from an insider, the media in the " new normal " is out of control, it's pushing lies and propaganda towards a Orwellian future. Wake people up to the truth! I Quote:</p>
<p>The news media and the government are entwined in a vicious circle of mutual manipulation, mythmaking, and self-interest. Journalists need crises to dramatize news, and government officials need to appear to be responding to crises. Too often, the crises are not really crises but joint fabrications. The two institutions have become so ensnared in a symbiotic web of lies that the news media are unable to tell the public what is true and the government is unable to govern effectively. That is the thesis advanced by Paul H. Weaver, a former political scientist (at Harvard University), journalist (at <em>Fortune</em> magazine), and corporate communications executive (at Ford Motor Company), in his provocative analysis entitled <em>News and the Culture of Lying: How Journalism Really Works</em>.</p></p>

        <p>The most disturbing thing about all this covid insanity is that the more is known about the virus, the clear and indisputable evidence showing how it is far less deadly than presumed...the more they ignore, ridicule, dismiss, and silence every bit of truth that comes out. And the more they keep enacting these draconian and dystopian shit.</p>

        <p>Yeah, exactly. Every time people in this sub claim that things are getting better, people are ignoring the masks, people aren't afraid, that people are listening to the truth instead of the hype... I just wonder if I am living in an alternate universe somehow, because it feels like the truth is becoming <em>more</em> suppressed, people are <em>more</em> afraid, there's <em>more</em> draconian measures being implemented, etc...</p>

        <p>Right, logically this never should’ve gotten to this point in the first place, but it definitely should be over and forgotten about by now. The fact that they keep getting more and more restrictive in the face of all facts and reason tells me this isn’t going to end any time soon. There are clearly ulterior motives afoot and anyone who thinks this has to do with a virus at this point is incredibly naive. I hope I’m wrong in my predictions of the future, but so far I have no reason to believe this will end anytime soon, or will not end in further dystopian measures, such as forced vaccination among other issues.</p>

        <p>So, news reporting has turned into "stories with a sharp dramatic focus that both implied and aroused intense public interest" thanks to Joseph Pulitzer changing the face of newspapers. I hadn't thought about this before.</p>
