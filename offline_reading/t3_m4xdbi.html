    <strong>A Good Company</strong>
    <p><p>Hello all,  </p>
<p>I work for a private company. Large, but private. could easily be public. Something like a Menards but different industry. I do not wish to give out details. I mean, I really want to, I'd love to shout it from the top of my lungs, but I'm not sure they'd like that.  </p>
<p>Regardless this is about all my company is doing in regards to Vaccines, confirmed by an in person meeting this week. They provide the CDC hand out and said "if you want one and absolutely can't find one see HR so they can help you schedule a vax somewhere"  </p>
<p>Here's from the official Vaccination Update Email so to speak.  </p>

<p>I know many aren't safe, and at far pushier companies, particularly anything publicly owned, but there are still some good companies out there. They understand it's a completely personal decision. And to be honest most of our managements been over the masks for many months. Also can't remember the last time we sent a sick person for a wuflu test, which makes sense as it was just 2 weeks paid off for usually little more than a sniffle.  </p>
<p>If you are in a crunch with your employer or something similar, it should be a light in the darkness to know, there are SOME options out there. I know there's gotta be more than mine!</p></p>

        <p>I work for a bunch of a-holes that are pushing the vaccine hard. But they always add "personal decision and not mandated" into the emails. Your company seems a lot saner.</p>

        <p>Sadly I think a lot of it will come down to the politics of those at certain levels of the company. Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised - especially as once a year they have someone come in for free flu jabs. But even that's always no pressure - just save a trip to Walgreens if you want it.</p>
<p>I expected to hear they'd be working on getting someone in, helping making appointments, etc. But no not at all.</p>
<p>I think it's liability. My company and many others in IL got sued for using a Biometrics company with poor conditions. Never gathered consent, etc. Lots of us, LOTS of us, across many different companies got nice $800-1200 checks.</p>
<p>Now, after that and getting it fixed, let's go mandate all our employees to take an experimental vax?</p>
<p>Thinking they learned their lesson. No Shareholders or Government to bail them out.</p>
