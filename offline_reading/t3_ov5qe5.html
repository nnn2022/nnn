    <strong>The year is 2024</strong>
    <p><p>We just got over a wonderful summer of "freedom" under our wonderful president Joe Biden. We got to have our masks off after another horrific fall. Which during the fall we had to wear masks regardless of vaccination status due to a mask law Biden put in place due to the new Covid Variant. </p>
<p>"If you're area is in the red according to the CDC you should lockdown for two weeks regardless if the staff is fully vaccinated" Biden says "my election is coming up I need people to vote again for me from the comforts of their home".</p>
<p>CDC comes out with a map showing 2/3 of the country is in the red. Meaning those states with high infections with more than 200 cases must lockdown. "Before the number of cases would average 50-100 that was when we let people do whatever they wanted even though we recommend masks. We allowed businesses to make their own decisions regarding masks and vaccines.. It's unfortunate but I told everyone back in 2021 we were only a few mutations away from a break through Variant against all of the vaccines. We strongly encourage people during these difficult times to wear masks, distance, stay home and get the booster!" Walenski says.</p>
<p>Businesses like the restaurant Karen manages in NYC strongly encourages people to get the booster and wear masks "This new Variant is no joke! I know someone from a cousin of mine from a friend of theirs from a hospital worker that their hospital beds are at full capacity! They have all said they wish they got the booster! All of my workers are vaccinated and I will require them to get it!" When asked if Karen will make customers wear masks she strongly encourages them to do so "I've been making them wear masks since the Delta Variant! I know someone who can't get the vaccine who would have been scared to come eat here if everyone else didn't wear a mask. I know people want to take them off but please don't be a maskless asshole do the right thing and stop the spread!"</p></p>
