    <p><p>Loads of people are accepting masks and distancing as part of our lives now. Meanwhile you have the country divided with some states reopening, not reopening, counties with mandates and counties without. We could have done a huge lockdown early on and probably gotten rid of the pandemic a lot sooner. They told us two weeks, but never enforced it. At least not a world wide lockdown. Why didn't they do this? Well simple if there are only a handful of people now thinking what we are still doing now has gone on for too long, imagine what it would have been like if they did a hard lockdown for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>They wanted to tire us out. They wanted to drag this on for a long time so that instead of having temporary control with a lot of backlash, they were wanting long term control with very little backlash. People would have been asking "Where is the data?" When now it has been some time for the sheep to collect it and use it toward anyone who speaks out against it. If the government really cared about us they would have done the lockdown at the very start of this thing. Would it have worked? Who knows. It could have proven either two things. That a lockdown would have worked or a lockdown wouldn't have worked so if there is another pandemic they would know what to do for next time.</p>
<p>Now when there is another pandemic sometime in the future they can easily say "We need to lockdown because remember when Covid hit and we didn't"? I guarantee you there will be little to no push back if they made the decision to do that. When they simply could have tried it with this one and see if it was effective or not. Instead we are living with the restrictions way past two weeks and most of the public is either too afraid to go back to how things were or approves of how we are living today. The vaccine passports and pressuring people to get vaccinated was an easy way for them to divide us even more.</p>
<p>"If you make people uniform, you can control them. If you teach people to read, and think, and question things, you lose control. So, the best idea is to separate people if you wish to maintain a monetary system. It's called divide and conquer. By dividing people, they're not a threat, you can control them." - Jacque Fresco</p></p>

<p>I believe you're right, but keep in mind that the longer it goes on, the uglier the backlash is liable to be.</p>
<p>They're creating a pressure cooker.</p>

<p>I believe the time for mass backlash was last year. At this rate, I see people just getting used to it, and carrying on with life. Most people approve of the restrictions, and those that don't are just a drop in the bucket compared to the billions who do.</p>

        <p>The only thing a lockdown does is delay the inevitable.  Take Australia and New Zealand, for example.  They have "controlled" the virus, but their borders are closed.  What do you think will happen when they reopen them?  A virus is going to virus.</p>

        <p>Gee, Alarming_Tension_843! Why do you think the governments of the world are doing this? They must be plumb stupid, and just looking at the wrong data! Hot dog! They're just dummies who don't know better, and there's no nefarious agenda at work!</p>
