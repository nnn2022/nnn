        <p>My dad watches it every morning and his day off and it bothers me....</p>
<p>I love my dad so much he has supported me for my whole life and truly does care for me but he has high blood pressure and was easy to anger even before covid I don't really know where he stands on it he does not share any of his own opinions but I know he does not understand it as I do from some things he has said earlier on to me in the pandemic like "You're doing everything that is recommended right" and b"just get in the habit of putting on the mask when you go into a store"</p>
<p>Now he works for Canada Post and hates the fact that his boss forces him to wear a mask when doing PO boxes when she is with him now cause he can't see in it. I have explained things to him like how the death counts are calculated and overinflated and he just said "I don't wanna hear it" and once He was talking about the flu cause it was on the news and I said so you know flu cases in Ontario and reporting are all down and they are all being reported as covid cases and he erupted "you can't compare this to any flu" and argued with me but then we made up and hugged and told each other we love each other so I love him but I wish he watched less news but I can't change him nor would it be right for me to try!</p>
<p>He has been like this long before covid he was obsessed with watching the news for the latest shooting funny the news does not really cover shootings anymore a year ago they were like 2 or 3 a week and that was the Canadian news covering US shootings...</p>

        <p>lol, do you even know how the term "conspiracy theorist"  was coined?</p>
<p>"trained professionals" </p>
<p>I don't even know where to start with you honestly, you are so pathetic you have a  goddam mask on your Reddit avatar and you come in here to make snippy remarks.</p>
<p>I bet you give people with no mask in public dirty looks and would gladly film one if they came inside a store without one.</p>
<p>People like you are so lost in the clueless propaganda that you probably watch daily on the news that you are conditioned to believe and comply without question to the "trained professionals"</p>
<p>I could call you out on the sheer hypocrisies of these covid bylaws and you would not care because it's going against the public narrative....</p>
<p>So continue to listen to the professionals and mindlessly comply because you think one day it will go back to normal...</p>
<p>If I were you I would do some research on Klaus Schwab see how he contradicts himself in his book compared to tv. In his book, he claims that Covid is one of the least deadly pandemics humankind has experienced not as bad as other pandemics but it is still a great opportunity for change.</p>
<p>Compared to when you see him on the tv spouting about how dangerous it is etc..</p>
<p>So you can buy into the whole mask up to protect others bullshit argument, that simply exist and positive affirmation that you are doing the right thing. </p>
<p>But please don't turn against your fellow man over this is tt really worth it...</p>

        <p>&rt;Exactly how does a mask infringe on your rights</p>
<p>Personally, I think just the idea of forcing someone to do something is wrong does not matter what your motives are... And the act of forcing someone to comply especially when they are not violent violates your "god" given rights some would refer to them as.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you want to talk about government-provided rights I'm not aware of anything in the US but where I live in Canada we have something called "security of "person" it is under section 7 of the charter this is used in abortion law and some judges have found that section 7 of the charter dictates that you get to control what happens to your body that includes what you place upon it and would therefore include a mask.</p>
<p>Surgeons use masks for different reasons than the ones that are being touted to us for covid.</p>
<p>Do you even realize that masks don't do anything for asymptomatic cases unless you are worried about someone sneezing you really have no reason to wear a mask..</p>
<p>"  It's not a new thing, it's been proven effective for doctors and medical professionals. "</p>
<p>Again surgeons use masks for different reasons and do you really think every doctor agrees with you on masks personally I recently went to an ear nose and throat sepcialists and once I got into his office he dropped his mask and told me I don't care you don't gotta wear yours, this guy has a Ph.D. and is more educated than both of us but keep on touting what you hear on the news about how masks will save us.</p>
<p>Personally, I am dropping my masks in more places now because of things I read in this sub still cant go unmasked in grocery stores here in Ontario but every else is pretty much fair game.</p>
<p>I live in a rural town of 10k people and I see people wearing them in cars and outside it is ridiculous these people don't even take the time to educate themselves on what masks actually do</p>

        <p>Least deadly doesn’t mean it’s not going to affect people. The mask on my avatar doesn’t have literally anything to do with this very real and serious pandemic. The people that think like you are the ones who extend the danger of the pandemic. I have never filmed anyone because I understand that it’s stupid and random and might affect there life. From the articles of Klaus Schwab i have seen he appears to not have any degree involving medical anything really. Also at least I’m doing something by wearing a mask, what do you mean mindlessly comply to professionals i literally only wash my hands a little more and wear a mask it’s not mindless because putting a piece of cloth on my mouth doesn’t doesn’t mean I just follow everything they say.</p>

        <p>We do listen to trained professionals. Not only in the things affected by lockdown (economists etc) but also scientists. There are a number of scientists who have pointed out their observations and studies on the measures and the actual danger of the virus, and an even larger number who don't support it but won't say for fear of losing their job. The information is unfortunately censored and buried, but it's not impossible to find. I hope that you'll be able to look past the propaganda and find facts and studies, and if you would like to then we here would be happy to help you!</p>

They see that information and believe that “this says masks don’t work that’s proof masks can’t possibly work they’re useless.” I’m just saying that just because Dr. bla bla bla says masks don’t work, and Professor whatshispants found different results, doesn’t mean that either are wrong. </p>

        <p>I guess so. This year went wrong because people on both sides forgot that science isn't something to be treated like a one sided religious cult where anything that doesn't agree is evil. It is a collection of hypothesis', facts, studies, ideas, conclusions and many other things, but most importantly being able to question and test things (whether they are 'established fact' or not) is what science is. To me, I have always seen a lot of holes in the mask argument but the Danish mask study really cleared up uncertainty. I'd be interested to see what shaped your view? Tbh as long as people's opinions are educated and well thought out I don't really mind if they agree with me.</p>

        <p>The biggest problem for me is masks were denounced at the beginning of the pandemic, the most important time for wearing them when this thing was at its peak. We were lied to, and that's why I struggle to trust my government's mandates anymore. </p>
<p>Surely the study of mask-wearing was carried out for SARS-COV-1 then wouldn't it have been common sense to just recommend them to the public as a precaution anyway at the forefront of the pandemic?</p>
<p>I think the majority of us, (but not all) understand the virus and its capabilities but we like to look a little further and see what political agendas are stemming on the back of this, and that's what this sub stand for because we fear it could be something sinister.</p>

        <p>Well to be fair part of the reason masks weren’t common sense in the beginning was because the virus was so new. The didn’t want to just say masks for everyone without properly research their defense against this virus.</p>
