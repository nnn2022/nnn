    <strong>Dissenting opinions.</strong>
    <p><p>Id like to commend our mods for allowing people who obviously disagree with us to post and be a part of this group. If we censored them the way they do on there subs we'd be just another echo chamber. And they're fun to argue with anyways.</p></p>

        <p>so far though people have been bringing pretty weak game in defending the status quo and “consensus.”</p>
<p>some questions i’d like answered</p>
<p>-what is the basis for the belief in asymptomatic spread worthy of restricting the lives at a population level.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>what is the best evidence that masking “works?” we know the double masking reco comes from a simulation with a mannequin and aerosol particles, not a randomized study comparing infection or outcomes.  there are others like this, and the one with the hair dressers.  many of us see masking as authoritarian window dressing and a forced show of obedience/solidarity as opposed to something thats obviously moved the needle in the wild.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i’d like a reflection on the costs of covid, which is something like a 10% increase in total deaths in america, less of a total increase in other countries, compared with the huge costs and downsides of such extreme societal measures.  IS COVID STILL WORSE THAN THE LOCKDOWNS?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>why are we talking about mandating vaccines when “so much in unknown” about whether they even make a dent in transmission.   many of us here see the timing of release at the back end of the seasonal hump as a way of piggy backing the vaccines to the natural decline, which you can see happen every year with flu, sometimes early trending down in feb like covid did this winter, or sometimes later or earlier.  look up flu deaths o other years and you will see a similar curve to what we have been seeing.  it is natural and expected for these curves to go up AND down, so why did we hype this thing up as the super killer mystery bug?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>at what point do we live with some covid deaths in order to live our lives like we do with so many other diseases and causes of deaths that also impact many hundreds of thousands of people, yet free society used to keep on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>those are just some starter questions i thought up.  there are many more im sure.  we dont want dissenters to feel unwelcome, but we are fucking sick and tired of the lockdowns, and all the politicized groupthink and social larping as intelligent scientific neighborly caring, thats kept us in an unthinkable situation.  we want our lives back, or better proof that this isn’t some vietnam or iraq war lie from a podium for some nefarious and undemocratic intents.</p>

        <p>Trouble is: they don't give us the same courtesy.   </p>
<p>A regular r/covidiots poster commented here recently, got downvoted and someone said something along the lines of "i'm fuckign done with answering questions". And the poster took that as a cue to go whine on r/covidiots about how he had been "cursed out" and downvoted. I replied there that honestly while swearing isnt ideal, he should have expected the downvotes. I was a polite a reasonably possible, you can read for yourself.</p>
<p>Within no-time i had 10 doomers on my tail telling me to fuck off and i also got downvoted, like expected, but still ya know, hypocrites...<br>
I basically said okay fine, but why do you whine about being downvoted and cursed at, then do the exact same thing. </p>
<p>They really didnt have a reply other than to call me a murderer.</p>
<p>Things like that make me a whole less keen on giving doomers a voice on here even for "polite debate" because these hypocrites never allow us the same courtesy and 50/50 chance they will just turn around and go whine on covidiots what morons we are the next minute. </p>
<p>There is really no benefit or no point at all in giving them a voice here. They dont really want to hear our point of view, they don't really want to listen, we're not gonna convince them, they're not gonna convince us. So why bother?</p>

        <p>A big contribution to the hostile and divisive social and political environment in the U.S. is the fact that people aren't open to dissenting discourse. Constructive discourse is what allows us to find the most appropriate solutions to our problems! Regardless of our personal beliefs.
