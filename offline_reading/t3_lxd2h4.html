    <strong>Tonight's Uber Driver was a New Ex-Nurse of Twenty-Seven Years,</strong>
    <p><p>and she had some interesting things to say.</p>
<p>She first mentioned how Uber takes 70% of the fare, drivers are quitting, and mentioned the possibility of both Lyft and Uber shutting down briefly because of it. She also Lyfts, like a boss. This outage may only be localized, yet this impacts myself and potentially others greatly. I work second shift. I can bus to work, but covid restricts the buses to stop at 10pm. I clock out at 10pm. If people cannot get to or from work efficiently, jobs are lost. More economic fuckery.</p>
<p>She <em>also</em>, and more importantly, very recently got laid off from her job of twenty-seven years as a nurse because she refused to get it after they mandated the vaccine. She scoffs masks and I love it. She's seen more than most, said she was in the covid unit for five months, described some inconsistencies among another few things, and I'll refuse the shot right along with her.</p>
<p>Paraphrasing from her mouth:</p>
<p>Â· At one point they had, "Fifty patients with fifty different symptoms," such as a rare rash. I can't recall the one other rare symptom she mentioned. It was a short ride.</p>
<p>Â· She also mentioned a boy in a specified local hospital recently got his hand and both legs (below knee?) amputated <em>because of covid</em>?? Make that make sense, please. I hope it was a misremember.</p>
<p>Â· Her own sister succumbed to her five year battle with brain cancer within two weeks (may have been two days, cannot recall) into the first lockdown and was labeled as a covid death, despite the claim her sister <em>had never taken a PCR or any other Covid test.</em></p>
<p>Damn, I wish I'd recorded that conversation. I hope I get her as a driver again so I can ask</p></p>

        <p>Sounds like an awesome medical professional. Feeling pretty rare these days.</p>
<p>My most recent uber ride was the worst. The driving spent the first few minutes virtue signalling, then the rest was a rant about how he <em>hates antimaskers</em> and drilling me for my stance. Good 'ol human interaction. ðŸ˜‘</p>

        <p>Ffs. I just realized I was born twenty-seven years ago. She could have been there when my mom got put in a chemically-induced coma and I was born seven weeks early. Thanks pneumococcal! Put my mom in medical books for the ground-breaking treatments ðŸ˜Ž</p>

        <p>If you tipped well and were chill you probably will get her again. Drivers remember and recognize cool passengers too. Im super friendly, tip well give them a good rating and always get picked up within minutes.</p>

        <p>I schedule mine every night. The first driver canceled, the asshat. But, in his defense, I sent this with the horrible error....</p>
<p>"Hello! I have a question: If I were to add a stop, would you be okay to bring my brother to work after dropping me off? We love together"</p>
