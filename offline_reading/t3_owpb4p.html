    <strong>Hospitalized Covid-19 Experience</strong>
    <p><p>I've been a frequent and firm member of this sub since the beginning. (Still Am) </p>
<p>I have to share my experience with all of this. It's a real disease though not many disputed its existence in the first place. I contracted it the 20th and have just finished recovering. I'm a 26 yr old female well within the bracket of people who shouldn't have had a rough time. The universe put me in the hospital on the 22nd, just two days in. I have no diabetes or any underlying condition, average weight build and moderately active.</p>
<p>My symptoms:
- Overwhelming Bodily Pressure
- Extreme Fatigue
- Nausea/Vertigo
- Reduced Oxygen Intake
- 100% loss of taste/smell  (still cant but it's more of an 80% now)</p>
<p>I had no fever the entire time, and was put on supplemental oxygen while I was down around 88%. It was a little nerve wracking but the worst of it past after those first 4 days. Was not gasping for air or anything that dramatic but I was so incapacitate by the illness my sick husband (also covid) could not help me in the ways I needed.</p>
<p>Let me back up now, the reason I got hospitalized was for severe symptoms. THE FAULT WAS MY OWN because I tried to continue to work after just starting to feel symptoms. I chalked it up to a cold that I could work through, since I never had a fever how was I going to tell my boss? My skepticism of its severity pushed myself into the hospital.</p>
<p>Will I get the vaccine? NOPE, I got my Antibodies the hard way.</p>
<p>My point to all of this? 
Just respect your body if you get it. Don't be a fool like me, take it easy not to strain your body.</p></p>

        <p>Pretty much the same story for everyone I know that caught it. The only difference is it sounds like it hit you a bit harder with the oxygen intake. All but one of the people I know that caught it were sent home the same day and told pretty much to ride it out. The one guy, my brother in-law, I guess, had it the worst. He was on oxygen for about 2 months I think. But he was over weight and very unhealthy.</p>

        <p>Glad you got through it. Most people I’ve met believe the disease is real, as you know the only concern is the government over reach.</p>
<p>If the world was serious, you would have been given a prophylactic or other preventative pill to keep your symptoms low.</p>

        <p>Interesting. When I got it, i had almost those same symptoms.  They told me to stay home unless I had trouble breathing. I was sick for two weeks. Of course, that was before the hospitals got paid to admit people with covid. I wish you a healthy recovery!</p>

<p>If we are going to agree "Covid" is real, it will never go away. Tests, masks, jabs, loss of freedoms, we get to keep it all! Hope you feel better.</p>

        <p>Kind of reminds me of when I had pneumonia. Not saying that's what you had but I remember having similar symptoms aside from the loss of taste and smell. I did the exact same as you. I tried to work through it until my boss told me to go to the doctor which I did. Although, the pneumonia lasted significantly longer (talking a few weeks or similar symptoms even while taking antibiotics). Glad you're back on your feet.</p>

        <p>Question for you, did you take any medication BEFORE you started feeling the more severe symptoms? </p>
<p>Most people I know that got "Covid" really only had flu symptoms until they were dosed with powerful prescription meds (steroids, antivirals, antibiotics etc.) whose side effects may actually be the "disease".</p>
