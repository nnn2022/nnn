    <strong>How do people not see through the lies and deception yet?</strong>
    <p><p>This is my experience being based in the UK.</p>
<p>Starting from the beggining we had china pumping out propaganda of people dropping dead in the streets and being locked inside their houses. People slate Trump for wanting to shut off flights to China calling him a racist. Few weeks later Italy go into lockdown, a country with one of the oldest populations and where most families live together (kids, parents and grandparents) Next the whole world goes into lockdown, apart from the many countries that didn't lockdown, including Sweden which also happend the be the first country to adopt microchips, weird coincidence but oh well. Rumours start to spread that every death is being called a covid death, people are becoming skeptical, but don't listen to your gut listen to the man on your TV telling you to fear the deadly virus. Oh and another weird coincidence is the event 201 which took place a few weeks before all this, strange that it simulated the spread of a coronavirus like what is happening now, nah just another one of those weird coincidences better keep listening to the man on the TV. Weird that the fella that invented that PCR test says it shoudn't be used for detecting viruses, oh well im sure the experts know what they're doing.</p>
<p>2 weeks to flatten the curve, yeah okay we can do that. 4 weeks to flatten the curve hmmm okay. 6 weeks to flatten the curve, yeah whatever let's just get it over with. Summer comes around and the government know that they cant keep people inside their homes during the good weather. So we're allowed back out again in groups of 6. It's also worth mentioning at this point that there has been no mask requirements in shops or anywhere at all. Also during this period people started talking and noticed that nobody really knows anyone who has died from the virus, or if they had they were on the brink of death anyway, but the man on the TV says thousands are dying so it must be true.</p>
<p>Somewhere around this time the orwellian phrase "New Normal" is born.</p>
<p>Around this time we start seeing the blatant censorship from YouTube and other sites such as Facebook. Completely scrubbing anything that goes against the mainstream narrative, to do this mainstream media began heavilly reporting on 5G conspiracies to discredit the real issues.</p>
<p>Eventually pubs and restaraunts reopen, people can travel around the country in their groups of 6, life almost felt normal again, but there was still the lingering doubt in the air of the deadly virus that was nowhere to be seen but still being pumped through mainstream media everyday. Still no masks at this point, and still nobody really knows a healthy person who has died, on top of this cases aren't very high.</p>
<p>Oh I almost forgot that around this time a police officer decided to choke a man of african descent to death infront of a crowd of people recording him (personally I think this was done on purpose but that's another story alltogether) police officers had been doing this for years but this one was different, this one mattered. So much so that the mainstream media began HEAVILLY repoorting on it and this great new movement called Black Lives Matter was born. Now if you question anything about BLM then you must essentially hate balck people. BLM hold massive protests across the world, but the covid is a nice virus and doesn't go after political movements.</p>
<p>Towards the end of Summer cases start to rise (weird coincidence) NHS track and trace app gets released to control the spread of the virus. So were now in October, everyone has to wear a mask in stores, nobody really knows why but they do. In the words of my dad "I was brought up in a generation that do what they're told" - actual quote when I question him.</p>
<p>November 1st, month long lockdown announced, the virus is getting stronger, cases are going up. But still I don't know any person who wasn't pretty much already dead that has died, hell I don't even know anyone who has had it that said it was worse than a cold. I even know multiple people who tested positive but didn't pass it on their housemates, weird how the most infectious virus in the world works, it's almost as though nobody has really figured it out yet but don't worry the scientists are making massive leaps in fast-tracking the new experimental vaccine.</p>
<p>So now this month long lockdown is over we'll be fine for Christmas and people can go visit their family, nope. Right before Christmas tier 4 is announced for most major cities. Thanks to the "new strain that has been discovered".</p>
<p>Now everyones Christmas freedom that they were promised for their co-operation in the November lockdown is gone. Christmas is over, everyones getting fed up, we're now stuck in this strange limbo phase between Christmas and New Year with rumours circulating of a 2 month lockdown in January.</p>
<p>January rolls around, yay new year same shit, probably worse, lockdown until March. But good news the vaccine is ready, we've managed to do what usually takes 10 years in 10 months. For a virus we don't even really understand yay how amazing is that, it even somehow works against the new strain don't ask how we know we just do.</p>
<p>This vaccine must be injected into every person so that we can go back to normal. Ignore the fact that multiple countries have managed to defeat the virus with no lockdowns or vaccines at all. If you all take your vaccine you can be free like them and life will be normal again.</p>
<p>Normal is gone, life will not go back to normal ever again. Somehow people seem to think that if they take this one magical experimental MRNA vaccine that has NEVER been used on humans before then life will just go back to normal and we'll all look back on these crazy covid times in a few years and have a good chuckle. I feel like I've essentially watched the government wear down the general population with propaganda and lockdowns to the point where they are actually excited to take this vaccine.</p>
<p>Thankfully there's alot of people out there who aren't afraid to question the mainstream narrative and continue to question it. A line is being drawn in history right now and people need to get on the right side of it before it's too late.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Wrote this all in on sitting, missed out so many details I could add but I don't have the energy i'm sick of this shit tbh.</p>
<p>Edit: Not sure how I managed to forget our lord and saviour Bill Gates who has somehow become the world health advisor even though he sells software lmao.</p>
<p>Edit 2: One thing even the people who watch the news 24/7 can't answer is why are cases spiking now when we are all wearing masks and seeing nobody, but they didn't reach this level in the summer when no masks were required and people could travel and meet in groups of 6. Almost like a thing called flu season exists maybe.</p></p>

        <p>I love rants like this. You have essentially written what I wake up to in the morning and what I go to sleep to at night.</p>
<p>Your comments regarding the declination in summer even when we were socialising and going to pubs and the increase in winter hit the fucking nail on the head... oh and the not using masks until july but the cases had already dropped.... now they're flying up again...when everyone is using masks</p>
<p>Must be those very few who dont wear masks nothing to do with flu season at all... come to think of it, where has flu gone this year?</p>

        <p>It's a really good summary of the fuckery that is going on. The problem of getting people to open their eyes has many facets, some of which I believe are related to understanding generational traits. Somehow our political masters have managed to play to the worst tendencies of every generation from teenagers to octogenarians in spinning this Scamdemic. It will take different strategies to wake up different groups. Some of the strategies may actually conflict.</p>
<p>In every watershed event of the past (wars, economic crashes, civil unrest, etc) there has always been an underlying current of generational conflict. Note that in The Great Corona Panic, <em>every generation seems united in a blind hysteria. I don't think I ever recall seeing this before.</em></p>
<p>They have hooked the Olds and the Boomers by playing to their tendency to believe everything a TV talking head or "authority figure" says.</p>
<p>They've played to the cynicism of Gen X by using political distractions to take their focus away from the Scamdemic, and fostered an attitude of "Oh well, we're screwed anyway. Why bother? What can we do?"</p>
<p>They've played to Millennials and Gen Z by taking advantage of their obssession with social media, tendencies towards conformity and groupthink, and their fear of being outcasted or "cancelled". Not to mention free money from Uncle Sugar.</p>
<p>I don't know what the answer is, but I don't think there is a "silver bullet" to reach all these people and wake them up.</p>

<p>Bill Gates has been <em>de facto</em> in charge of global health for years through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's grants to aid organisations and research facilities. Having worked in NGOs, I thought this was common knowledge.</p>

        <p>Yup I feel bad saying it. Throughout my life I never came across as very opinionated to those around me. Then this shitshow happened and I've been trying to wake some people up ever since.</p>
<p>I wasn't always known as a 'conspiracy theorist'. It was when this started  happening that everything started to click. Things I've heard in the past or maybe read on my way down the rabbit hole made perfect logical sense. If what we know isn't 100% accurate about what is happening in the world around us.. I'm at least damn sure we have the majority of it right</p>

        <p>&rt;Towards the end of Summer cases start to rise (weird coincidence)</p>
<p>Weird indeed. Here's a picture of my summer in Northern California. Beaches were packed a people boating like I've never seen before. Most likely since that was the only thing we were allowed to do. The casino in my local area was packed like a night club, again one of the few things allowed to stay open. The parks local to my area were filled more and more as time went on. Perhaps people don't like being locked up so they did what little they were allowed. We kept mask on in businesses. Visited lake Tahoe in the summer for a small get away. Again packed beaches and casinos. My downtown area and local bars brought the drinks outside with no mask at tables.</p>
<p>Extremely weird that none of this all summer long lead to an increase in cases. You could argue the outdoor thing...but I won't buy it.</p>

        <p>Yeah I was saying from the start that they'll "give us the summer off" and I'd say that's exactly what they did. Toned the propaganda and fear mongering down a notch because there was no way people were gonna stay inside during the blistering heat.</p>
<p>Just the fact that you could meet 6 people in the UK should have been enough for everyone to get ill, didn't even have to be the same 6 people either.</p>

If this were a movie I was watching, I’d be like, ‘yeah right, no way so many people would fall for that, what an unbelievably poorly written script’

        <p>The answer is that socialism took the western world by the balls. They started in Europe. The countries that has been at war with eachother for over 400 years become united under a banner of socialism. They control everything, neuter their people by taking away their guns and controling their economies. </p>
<p>Socialist agendas infected schools across the western world. It used to be just higher education until the generations shifted and older teachers left the school systems to be replaced by the young new teachers with those fresh socialist ideals. </p>
<p>Socialism teaches you not to question, to obey the state because the state takes care of you. Socialism is the seed for something even worse though- communism. </p>
<p>The new normal is the push into communism for the developed world. Resist it.</p>

        <p>Great post, but BLM was around for a long time. I still remember it from 2016. It comes around every American election year. It’s sort of an American tradition to have BLM riots or protests every election year. Expect to see BLM to make a comeback 2024.</p>

        <p>There's no real mechanism for all of society to just change rapidly without top-down intervention. This is why we limit the power of the government. Once they make a decision, it's what we live with until we decide it's such a grievance that we're willing to fight and die to fix it. The lockdowns really suck, but we don't have enough fight and die support in opposition to them. So, what's going to happen? Nothing. Until the government realizes they fucked up, we're stuck with it. The government is going to take their fucking time with it because they don't actually care about us, so we're at the whim of things like congressional politics, party posturing, lobbying efforts (thanks for those expensive, rushed vaccines, Big Pharma), etc.</p>
<p>Hopefully more people like you will realize you are shouting into the aether when you wonder who's coming to save us. The answer is no one, and that should a) help you prepare your own life better and b) help you realize why we limit the powers of the government in the first fucking place.</p>
