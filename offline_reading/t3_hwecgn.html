        <p>Why would anyone wear a mask against a coronavirus?</p>
<p>It's disgusting.  All of their breaths are going upwards, sideways, and even through the mask.</p>
<p>All with a microbiome on their face, breeding weird diseases.</p>
<p>Fucking maskers.  They're the ones killing grandma and spreading disease.  IT's SCIENCE^TM.</p>

        <p>Even Trump is calling for masks.   I suppose it’s because coronavirus is a worldwide problem that’s created economic chaos and jammed up health care and the only way to control it is with masks and distancing.  If both Israel and Saudi Arabi use masks, the reason must be medical, because they wouldn’t agree on anything else, right? </p>
<p>I’ve heard people talk about weird diseases caused by bacteria under masks, but I haven’t heard details.  It sounds disgusting.  Is there somewhere on the web I could look?  Thanks!</p>

        <p>You’re right, lockdowns cause an economic mess.  One country, Sweden, decided to go the other way when the virus hit - no shutdown, no government health directives, they figured they just ride the wave and save their economy.   As a result, they’ve had a death rate 40% higher that the US.  And their economy tanked anyway.   </p>
<p>Lockdown was a horror show.  Businesses in my neighborhood were destroyed, people couldn’t pay rent.  Now that the virus is under control, things are getting better (I’m in MA).   MA and NY &amp; NJ got hit hard, but those are the states with the lowest infection rates right now.  Almost everything’s open and the economy is coming back.  When it comes to the economy, it turns out the only thing worse than lockdown is not having a lockdown.   No my opinion - look at every country in the world.</p>

        <p>The virus isn't under control in any of the states or countries. They just hit herd immunity. You can't control or stop this virus, those governors only pretend to have done something.</p>
<p>Every place has to hit a peak before it stops and slows down. How do you get a virus under control once and it never goes out of control again? It's not a person that you break its legs and it stops running.</p>

        <p>I’m not a scientist, so I don’t know enough about things like black mold to question any of that.   What I do know is this:  Coronavirus is screwing up the economy of every country in the world.   Countries have brought it under control, and all of them did it by using masks, distancing and sometimes lockdown.  That’s all we’ve got, at least for now.   I don’t know about occurrences of black mold or other disease anywhere in the world, or in the US for that matter, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a problem.  </p>
<p>You’re right, the virus isn’t gone.   It’s brought under control when there’s a low infection rate.    At that point, it’s low enough to be tracked, and people who get it are quarenteened.   I expect that at some point, the northeast will be hit again, probably a spread from one of the hot spots.  </p>
<p>Herd immunity requires that at least 70% of the population has been exposed to the disease.   Right now, somewhere around 5% of people in the US have been exposed.   NY has the highest rate, and it’s only between 15 and 20%.    So there won’t be herd immunity for a long, long time, unless we get a good virus.  </p>
<p>I’ve been trying to find info about diseases that are caused by masks, mold or anything else.  If anyone has a source with data about how many people develop those sorts of problem, plus things like age, location, I’d appreciate it if you send me a link.</p>

        <p>Neither am i a scientist but i can list a few things that prevent people from wearing masks</p>
<p>1 - Breathing difficulties which could be set off by the restriction of a facemask</p>
<p>2 - Anxiety disorders which prevent the use of facemasks</p>
<p>3 - People on the autism spectrum cannot wear masks, some can and will probably love it, but some can't, its a spectrum disorder after all</p>
<p>4 - Skin conditions which can make the wearing of masks uncomfortable (e.g https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermolysis_bullosa)</p>
<p>5 - Mask phobia, either born with it, or set off by a previous mask-related trauma (e.g muggery or bank robbery)</p>
<p>6 - Cultural, religious, reasons that dictates one cannot wear a mask </p>
<p>I don't believe masks can cause diseases but i don't think everyone should be forced to wear them for the above reasons</p>

        <p>I agree completely.  The people in those categories shouldn’t be required to wear mask, and they shouldn’t be constantly shamed about it.  I don’t know how that problem gets resolved.  New Zealand is a small country and had the best compliance, a shared concern for community.  From what I understand no one needed to be shamed, and id guess that people in your six categories were just accepted.   If someone’s now wearing a mask, there must be a good reason.  </p>
<p>I don’t know how to fix that problem here.</p>

<p>Wrong, those high numbers assume everyone is equally susceptible and infectious which we now have evidence that is not true.</p>
<p>Threshold is around 20-25%. Haven't you noticed that once places hit around 20%, that the virus just starts burning out on it's own? It's like that almost everywhere that's hit hard.</p>

        <p>The established sources I found, including NIH, agree with a higher number.   Granted, there’s a lot we don’t know about the virus, but something higher than 60% seems fairly well established from the data available at the moment.  </p>
<p>“As infectious disease epidemiologists, we wish to state clearly that herd immunity against COVID-19 will not be achieved at a population level in 2020, barring a public health catastrophe.”</p>

<p>“For this particular coronavirus, doctors estimate that about 60% to 70% of the human population would need to have antibodies in order to have herd immunity as a species.”</p>

<p>“With influenza, you need herd immunity of 60% to 70%. With measles, you need about 95%. With COVID-19, it’s somewhere in the middle,” he [Dr Gregory Poland, Mayo Clinic]. said</p>

<hr>
<p>“Based on early estimates of this virus’s infectiousness, we will likely need at least 70% of the population to be immune to have herd protection”</p>
<p>https://www.jhsph.edu/covid-19/articles/achieving-herd-immunity-with-covid19.html</p>
<hr>
<p>Assuming an R0 estimate of 3 for SARS-CoV-2, the herd immunity threshold is approximately 67%. </p>
<p>Assuming a uniform herd immunity threshold of 67% (R0 = 3) and an IFR of 0.6%, the absolute number of expected deaths across the globe would exceed 30 million people (Figure 2C). </p>
