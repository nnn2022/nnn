    <strong>Microsoft climate extremist, who views humanity as a plague, collaborated with Prof Neil 'Lockdown' Ferguson on developing the computer modelling framework for global pandemics, which was later used to persuade the government into lockdowns</strong>
    <p><p>This is a serious conflict of interest and is surely the real reason why Professor 'Lockdown' Ferguson's pandemic computer models keep on calling for lockdowns, as climate extremist Stephen Emmott was involved with the design.</p>
<p>Emmott gave a lecture at Darwin College Cambridge titled "The Human Plague" and he wrote a book on the topic called Ten Billion.  He also doesn't believe in human rights “Personally speaking, I think there should be no such thing as human rights. There should be a charter of human responsibilities, and if we were focused on human responsibilities rather than human rights we would be in a totally different place to where we are now. The root of this is about our collective responsibilities to each other and to other species we share the planet with.”</p>
<p>Could we really trust pandemic modelling from a man who wants us all locked down anyway?  Surely independent experts who are not conflicted in any way are required for making such critical predictions.</p>
