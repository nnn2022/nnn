        <p>This episode wasn't about a virus. In it, the family's home was burglarized, and from then on, the characters feel uncomfortable and afraid of another burglary or worse. They throw around ideas on ways they can feel safe, including never leaving their home again, giving away all their possessions, getting a gun, etc. The father, a psychologist, illustrates that safety is a notion that can't be taken away, and that the answer is to carry on with life, and not allow trauma to overtake their lives.</p>
<p>Again, though this situation is about a theft, I think the same applies to what is going on with the virus. The answer isn't to hide in fear forever, people need to stop allowing the fear to cloud their judgment and go on with their lives.</p>
