    <strong>Double whammied by local authorities. Can't express how depressing this has gotten.</strong>
    <p><p>Context:</p>
<p><a href="https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/quebec-to-implement-vaccine-passport-due-to-rising-covid-19-cases-premier-says-1.5535639">Quebec announces vaccine passports for non-essential services.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/uottawa-makes-covid-19-vaccination-mandatory-for-all-on-campus-1.5541604">uOttawa announces vaccine mandate for return-to-campus.</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The worst part? The complete silence that ensues. Not a peep in protest. In fact, you look around and all you can see is people being in support of this. Quebecois gym-goers in broad daylight talking about how good an idea it would be to impose on the unvaxxed, and how they are to blame for everything (parotting their favorite news source, no doubt). Parents and students cheering the "leadership" that uOttawa and Seneca college are displaying and calling for more universities to follow suit. Citing now-falsified pro-vaccine studies about transmission in an attempt to justify textbook authoritarian garbage. Ridiculous.</p>
<p>It's depressing. I feel like shit almost 24/7 now. I can't go on like this. I'm desperate, saving up like crazy. Soon as I can I'll move to Ontario. Then out of this fucking shithole country. I can't even stand the idea of living near people who think this is ok, out of malice or non-chalance. Notice: most vaxxers are not active supporters. But because they are vaxxed they don't care. To them, they just have to put up with one more hurdle. They can't understand the distress that the unjabbed feel when confronted with the news that their rights are under significant attack. Disgraceful.</p></p>

        <p>Be strong. My wife and I will keep you in our prayers. 
You have a purpose in life. We all do.
Any others that see this it doesn't matter if you don't believe in God. What dies matter is intent. Meditation, yoga etc.
Give OP love and strength. We are all brothers and sisters in this. Even the coerced need us.
We need as a whole to break through the fear.
God Bless.</p>

        <p>It is completely insane what this has come to and the lack of pushback against it. Canada is full of useful idiots who fell for the “we’re all in this together” propaganda. It’s sad to see. Keep your head up and do not give in.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I'm in BC and might have to move to Alberta one of these days.  Dark times, hang in there.  The number of breakthrough cases is rising, they won't be able to keep lying about the unvaxxed being the problem in society.</p>

        <p>Most cults have a forced-sex aspect. This is the progressive form: compassionate needle rape.  Here, the victim can also die.</p>
