        <p>What a horrific person.</p>
<p>Sadly, once you get far enough into it with these people, this is usually what they resort to. You get to see their true colors and the mask slips (pun very much intended). Unironically wishing the same virus claim people’s lives while patting yourself on the back for being such a good person for “doing the moral responsible things”, one would think the irony would hit these people in the face with freight train levels of weight and speed, but it never does. They have no self-awareness. </p>
<p>By the way, it’s no surprise this doomer is a part of the atheism sub and is a self-proclaimed part of the satanic temple. It’s just sad, really. Feel sorry for them more than anything.</p>

        <p>It's not real and these people are either paid to act like this to create the <em>illusion</em> people are out to get anti covid vaccine people, but very rarely do you see this type of behavior in real life. </p>
<p>It's like a fear tactic used to make people think the walls of society are closing in on them, when in reality that's completely false. You have free will and nobody can ever force you into a vaccination you dont want or need.</p>

<p>Wow, these people are horrible.</p>
<p>I did like one comment though from u/Lessnewnukacola</p>
<p>&rt;None of the vaccines prevent spread. That's not my conjecture, the companies that make them still agree you can get covid and spread it. That means all the vaccine does is lessen severity. That's good, and in the case of some people, potentially life saving for them to get the vaccine. </p>
<p>&rt;However. It explicitly means that not having the vaccine does NOT make you any more likely to "kill the person next to you". </p>
<p>&rt;Do some damn research. </p>
<p>Good stuff!!! Respect to both of you!!!</p>

        <p>I had someone, just today, on this very sub claiming to be a Healthcare professional telling me to just stay home and die already. Several times and in several different ways. Said my life didn't matter and to contact them when I'm dying of Covid so they could add it /leopardsatemyface. I don't believe for a second someone who wouldn't string two thoughts together without expletives was an actual Healthcare professional but was telling non the less.</p>

        <p>I feel your pain. On a subreddit for a city in my state, someone posted about hospitals in certain areas being at capacity because they cant move people out of beds and in to long term care (bc of covid). I was polite, thanked them for sharing, and advocated for more resources to be provided to overloaded hospitals. The post agressively advocated for vaccine use, masks, and social distancing. </p>
<p>I shared that I would do my part by wearing a mask and social distancing, but that I plan on waiting and getting more info before I get the vaccine. I was conflicted about it beforehand but I shared that my grandmother and my sister got it and both had a bad reaction. My sister had to be hospitalized but it wasnt as severe as my grandma, who was in the hospital for 2 months. The first 2 weeks that she was in the hospital she was not improving and we were told to get her affairs in order just in case. I was traumatized and anxiety ridden because of this. My life is still affected by this because im still worried about my grandma (thankfully she is getting stronger). But my sister seemed to develop food poisioning type symptoms that lasted for about a week and a half. She had to be hospitalized for dehydration from keeping no food or water down, and she has recovered from that... but the migraines that she developed never went away. She had to co lease her apartment and come to stay with me and my husband because she cant function. She has spent thousands so far seeing a neurologist to try and get the migraines to stop. </p>
<p>I admit that I should have known better and anticipated that I was going to get attacked for sharing this. The past few months of my life have felt like hell. I have had occasional moments of peace and I cherish them. I felt like it would be a weight off my chest if I just shared my experience. Nope. I got called an anti vaxxer who is probably lying and doesnt care about anyone but myself and is evil and heartless. Some guy went to my post history and critiqued that I wasnt posting about my grandma when she was in the hospital, so it didnt happen. Like wtf?? Idk about anyone else, but when I am in alot of mental duress, I use the internet as an escape. This may sound kind of messed up, but I also use that time to try to not think about whatever is causing me stress. I had to wait to even talk about my grandma to my friends (anyone outside my family), because I mentally couldnt take bringing it up. </p>
<p>Point is, these people are sick and I have a hard time believeing that they actually care about society as much as they claim. I will admit that I am selfish to an extent. I wont get the vaccine right now because I cant risk having that same reaction and then my husband being the only person to make money and take care of me and my sister. It wouldnt be possible. My family comes first, but ill wear a mask and social distance to make those around me feel safer. These people saying that people who hesitate about the vaccine deserve to be shot/assaulted/jailed are actual lunatics. I dont care what they think anymore.</p>
