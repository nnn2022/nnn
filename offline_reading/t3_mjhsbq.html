    <strong>No one is wearing a mask in my town anymore.</strong>
    <p><p>I've been noticing recently that no one wears a mask in my town anymore. It was glaringly obvious yesterday because it seemed like all the students from the local schools were walking down the street for some reason, and most of them didn't have masks, and the ones that did had it tucked under their chin.</p>
<p>It was beautiful.</p></p>

        <p>If you're talking about college students, no they don't. Look at the situation at most American Universities right now. They have stolen a year from these kids and there has not been a single meaningful resistance to any of it. Colleges used to be the cradle of counter culture. Imagine COVID in the 70s or 80s, hell even 10 years ago kids would be a lot more resistant to the media narrative</p>

        <p>&rt;You are putting lives at risk by not doing the right thing and just wearing a mask</p>
<p>Are you going to provide any evidence to backup that claim?</p>
<p>In what way did you arrive to that conclusion? With what sources and through what avenues of individual study and verification did you arrive to this conclusion?</p>
<p>Please explain.</p>
<p>&rt;Even if it saves one life it’s better than letting that person die</p>
<p>For every 1% the unemployment rate rises, economists estimate 47,000 people in the United States die as a result. This includes suicides, drug and alcohol overdoses, stress induced heart attacks and more.</p>
<p>The true unemployment rate reached about 25% and is currently about 18%.</p>
<p>That would be a little over 1.1 million people dead from forced Government shut downs alone in the Unired States.</p>
<p>This does not factor in the over 100 million people around the were hrust back into extreme poverty.</p>
<p>Could I not argue that "If it just saved ONE of their lives, we should not shut down the entire economy and not allow people to run their businesses"?</p>
<p>How do you determine that those people's lives are worth less than people who may have died of Covid?</p>
<p>Especially considering in the United States now, suicide deaths have overtaken Covid deaths?</p>
<p>&rt;Explain to me how you think this is similar to nazi Germany and I’ll tell you why your wrong.</p>
<p>No -- you are saying it's not. Therefore it is up to you to explain that view.</p>
<p>&rt;I’ll take back what I said about people not being sheep’s because I’m a way they are but they are doing it to save lives.</p>
<p>That's what they are being told.</p>
<p>The same thing happened after 9/11 when the US Government was entering a "temporary" war, that they were going to "temporarily" spy on US citizens, suspend habeus corpus, militarized the police,.enact insane security theater at airports and more.</p>
<p>They did it with legislation with names like "The Patriot Act."</p>
<p>All of it to "protect you from terrorism" and if you voiced suspicion you were "Insulting the families of 9/11 victims."</p>
<p>21 years later -- all those "temporary" measures are still in place and worse than ever before.</p>
<p>&rt;And let me guess, you don’t believe that hundreds of thousands of people have died from COVID.</p>
<p>Well how can you tell?</p>
<p>The CDC states that only 6% of all Covid deaths occures in people without preexisting health conditions. Which means they probably died as a DIRECT result of Covid.</p>
<p>Which means 94% of people who died WHILE infected with Covid had an underlying health condition.</p>
<p>If, according to the WHO, over 60% of all people infected withifh Covid-19 are asymptomatic and never display symptoms.</p>
<p>Then how do you determine that the obese 70-year-old wifh a heart condition who just died in your hospital and was found to be infected with Covid died BECAUASE of Covid?</p>
<p>How do you know he wasn't asymptomatic?</p>
<p>They don't...they just automatically label them a Covid death. Which makes no sense.</p>
<p>There's also the fact that the coronavirus relief packages pay hospitals even if a patient has no insurance. </p>
<p>Hospitals receive $13,000 per patient they labeled with Covid, but if they put them on a ventilator they receive $39,000.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that COVID-19 patients who are placed on a ventilator have a significantly decreased chance of recovering, thereby forcing patients on ventilators prematurely increases the death rate.</p>
<p>Many states do not require the inclusion of test results to prove COVID-19 on a death certificate.</p>
<p>So there is a financial incentive to label covid deaths.</p>
<p>Which is why even folks who are dying of motorcycle accidents while infected with Covid are labeled Covid deaths.</p>
<p>Like this man in Florida --https://wpde.com/news/nation-world/man-who-died-in-motorcycle-crash-counted-as-covid-19-death-in-florida-report-07-18-2020 </p>
<p>Or why magically the flue disappeared this year (how curious).</p>
<p>So it doesn't really add up to any kind of common sense logic or reasoning.</p>

        <p>&rt;Are you going to provide any evidence to backup that claim?</p>
<p>It's fucking obvious that masks reduce covid particles emitted.</p>
<p>&rt;In what way did you arrive to that conclusion? With what sources and through what avenues of individual study and verification did you arrive to this conclusion?
&rt;
&rt;Please explain.</p>
<p>What big brain studies have you used to show that masks don't reduce spread?</p>
<p>&rt;They don't...they just automatically label them a Covid death. Which makes no sense.</p>
<p>It makes sense considering that they just don't have time to carry out detailed autopsy's, since there's just so many deaths. Additionally, it could be hard to tell exactly what caused the death, and it is better to overestimate than underestimate</p>
<p>&rt;Studies have shown that COVID-19 patients who are placed on a ventilator have a significantly decreased chance of recovering, thereby forcing patients on ventilators prematurely increases the death rate.</p>
<p>Are you this fucking stupid? The people put on ventilators were the people with the most severe cases, ie those most likely to die, so of course outcomes are worse for patients on ventilators compared to those off</p>
<p>&rt;So there is a financial incentive to label covid deaths.</p>
<p>So what's your alternative, have the government <em>not</em> ensure everyone can access treatment for a once-in-a-generation pandemic?</p>
<p>&rt;Or why magically the flue disappeared this year (how curious).</p>
<p>It is better to over-estimate covid than under. Besides, we know that covid is more infectious and spreads more rapidly, so it's not surprising that it 'stole' some kills from the flu</p>

        <p>&rt;It's fucking obvious that masks reduce covid particles emitted.</p>
<p>That is not a scientific argument.</p>
<p>&rt;What big brain studies have you used to show that masks don't reduce spread?</p>
<p>"masks are NOT effective in preventing [the] general public from catching coronavirus,” </p>
<p>Surgeon General and CDC: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-cdc-says-americans-dont-have-to-wear-facemasks-because-of-coronavirus-2020-01-30</p>
<p>Fake data to try and push mask narrative: https://www.wsj.com/articles/kansas-democrats-covid-chart-masks-the-truth-11598483406</p>
<p>The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University summarized six international studies which “showed that masks alone have no significant effect in interrupting the spread of ILI or influenza in the general population, nor in healthcare workers.”</p>
<p>Oxford went on to say that “that despite two decades of pandemic preparedness, there is considerable uncertainty as to the value of wearing masks.” They prophetically warned that this has “left the field wide open for the play of opinions, radical views and political influence.”</p>
<p>https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/ </p>
<p>A study of health-care workers in more than 1,600 hospitals showed that cloth masks only filtered out 3 percent of particles</p>
<p>https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577.long</p>
<p>An article in the New England Journal of Medicine stated, “[W]earing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection” and that “[T]he desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic.</p>
<p>https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372</p>
<p>Other credible studies showing lack of mask efficacy, such as studies published in the National Center for Biotechnology Information, Cambridge University Press, Oxford Clinical Infectious Diseases, and Influenza Journal, just to name a few.</p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19216002/</p>
<p>https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-infection/article/face-masks-to-prevent-transmission-of-influenza-virus-a-systematic-review/64D368496EBDE0AFCC6639CCC9D8BC05 </p>
<p>https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/65/11/1934/4068747</p>
<p>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00307.x</p>
<p>Would you like me to continue?</p>
<p>&rt;It makes sense considering that they just don't have time to carry out detailed autopsy's</p>
<p>If 60% of all people are asymptomatic, then it would go to reason that the official Covid death count should be 60% less at least than what it is.</p>
<p>&rt;since there's just so many deaths</p>
<p>Or because hospitals get $13,000 every time they labeled a Covid death.</p>
<p>&rt;Additionally, it could be hard to tell exactly what caused the death, and it is better to overestimate than underestimate</p>
<p>Where is the data that it is better to "overestimate" deaths?</p>
<p>&rt;Are you this fucking stupid? The people put on ventilators were the people with the most severe cases, ie those most likely to die, so of course outcomes are worse for patients on ventilators compared to those off</p>
<p>The only data I have found is that ventilators increased deaths.</p>
<p>Please provide your data, thanks.</p>
<p>&rt;So what's your alternative, have the government not ensure everyone can access treatment for a once-in-a-generation pandemic?</p>
<p>Perhaps, as the most published MD on the subject in the world recommended in this hearing https://youtu.be/QAHi3lX3oGM </p>
<p>...we should not have told people "You have Covid...now go home until you feel like you're dying."</p>
<p>Nobody was informed of known over-the-counter drug treatments that have 80% effectiveness rates.</p>
<p>&rt;It is better to over-estimate covid than under.</p>
<p>According to who and what data?</p>
<p>The "overestimation" has destroyed countless people's lives, thrust hundreds of millions into extreme poverty, destroyed the economy, and killed millions more due to joblessness.</p>
<p>&rt;Besides, we know that covid is more infectious and spreads more rapidly, so it's not surprising that it 'stole' some kills from the flu</p>
<p>That doesn't make sense on a statistical basis.</p>

<p>That's called intentional ignorance. And that is why you are a mindless sheep, being controlled utterly by The State.</p>
<p>You cannot -- and WILL not -- think for yourself. In fact, you cannot even bare to entertain an opposing viewpoint, which means you never sought one out in the first place. Which is the FIRST thing any individual thinker would do when confronted with an apparent narrative consensus.</p>
<p>&rt;but I will talk about the comparison to nazi Germany. In case you don’t remember, that was when (off the top of my head) 6,000,000 people died because someone wanted to wipe out the Jewish. Tell me how that is the same as this.</p>
<p>Because they used fear and uncertainty to pit one group of people against another, then shut down all opposing viewpoints as "misinformation", encouraged neighbors to "snitch" on each other if they saw someone displaying "Wrong Think", used State-controlled media to push a narrative, and created a climate of fear if anybody spoke our against it or questioned it  and eventually forced people to identify what "side" they were on with articles of clothing.</p>
<p>This lead to millions of deaths.</p>
<p>This is a principle of psychology -- the ability of large otherwise intelligent groups of people to be systemically lured into giving up all of their freedoms, all if their liberties, and all of their autonomy and to even aid in the destruction of individual thought and discourse to further the agenda of a small group of people who make up The State.</p>
<p>You are displaying the same psychological principles.</p>

        <p>I looked through ur account the fact people like you even exist is fucking sad. Pathetic losers. Go cry about someone wearing a mask. I don’t give af if you wear a mask but can you stop giving a shit about what other people are doing it’s not a big fucking deal they aren’t bothering you. You are Literally a self proclaimed asshole and you think that’s cool. I feel bad for the people who have to be inconvenienced by your bs. Yes they don’t wanna talk to you. You are pathetic they’re hoping your bum ass will leave and not come back. (Referring to ur comment on this sub yesterday)</p>

        <p>In business, the underlings often wear masks because they are following the rules.  But, the business owners I deal with (real estate) don't wear masks when meeting in private, and often now tend to have discussions outside wear no mask is required.  A small amount of sanity appears to be returning.</p>

<p>Your statement is completely off.  People are dying immediately after taking the vaccine, and there are far far more serious injuries.  The CDC statement that there is no link between the deaths and the vaccine are just absurd.</p>

        <p>And I am telling you the CDC is lying.  There is a link between these side effects and death to the vaccine.  Buts it’s just the start, the vaccine will have its most large damage to you months and years after it starts modifying your gene expression.</p>
