    <strong>Why masks can't be compared to wearing clothing</strong>
    <p><p><strong>Why masks can't be compared to wearing clothing.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Facial expressions and body language are needed for almost all communication, but genitalia aren't necessary in most communication and are only used when couples bond or have children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Almost everyone use faces to recognize people, emotions and for communication. It's not only deaf, Hoh or autistic individuals needing to do it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You breathe through your mouth and nose, but not your groin. So, you won't feel the same humidity when wearing pants like masks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You've sense of smell and taste in your face, not in your groin area. You can look up mask breath. It's more to it than not brushing teeth, flossing, mouth wash, tongue scraping etc. I both floss, brush teeth, use tongue scraper, mouthwash and drink lots of water. It's about reused air combined with cheap masks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clothing like pants, sweaters, jackets and shoes are voluntarily used of most people for comfort. Keeping oneself warm, protecting against dirt, strong sunshine and sharp objects. Also used for decoration. Clothing are a necessity many choose to use and isn't mandatory. In some countries it's legal to be nude, but people still wears clothing by choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Masks can be useful if you're a medical professional who knows how to use them correctly and are in a sterile environment. Commoners knows how to wear pants, but not how to wear masks. A few other professionals may use other kinds of masks to protect themselves from spray painting or dust if they're a painter/construction worker or smoke and gas if they're fire fighters or military. That are special masks, not cloth masks. They're only used in a few situations, not all the time when outside of their homes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mental health and the uncanny valley. There's a reason many people don't like the mandatory face covering in Afghanistan and the common face covering in Saudi Arabia. People likes seeing the human underneath. So, masks can be optional. But shouldn't be mandatory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sensory issues related to masks are more common than clothing. Most autistic children learns to wear clothing voluntarily if they're made of the right fabric, with no labels on them etc. Many who aren't neurotypical have more difficulty wearing mask. Claustrophobic, PTSD and anxious people also are able to wear clothing most of the times.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you wants to wear a mask, you're free to wear one. But masks should NOT be compared to clothing and NEVER be mandatory, I thinks.</strong></p></p>

<p>Oh yeah and the never ending mockery of 'freedumb' and 'muh rights'. Seriously fuck these people. I can't believe they can still defend this shit. Entire cities have been destroyed. Children are being brainwashed. </p>
<p>There was a post on trashy the other day of a man holding a sign that said 'masking kids is child abuse' or something to that effect. Anyone with a fucking morsel of intelligence understands the horrible effects this is going to have on the youth. </p>
<p>I could go on all day. Fuck this dystopian nightmare, it's only going to get worse. Americans need to stand up, we are the catalyst that will determine the end result of this insanity. </p>
<p>Thousands of people are destroying BILLIONS of peoples lives. I'm seriously so fucking livid and disgusted by the brainwash that has taken over the world.</p>

        <p>Based. When people tell you this isn't about the election because this is going on worldwide, remind them that the US still has a very strong influence on the world stage. There are probably more than a few countries waiting to see how the election goes because it directly affects them.</p>

        <p>People wear seatbelts to keep themselves safe, not anyone else. Also, seatbelts are not a requirement for shopping, working, movie theaters, restaurants, or any other facet of life besides driving. And you can choose not to wear a seatbelt. You might get a ticket if you’re pulled over, but it’s a lot harder to tell if someone is wearing a seatbelt in a moving car than if a person is wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>also, it took 20+ years from when seat belts were dictated as standard equipment to being forced to actually wear them. at least, they went through the motions of actually legislating it, too.</p>
<p>and even before they were mandated as standard equipment, seat belts were a factory option, as were air bags.</p>

        <p>Also, seatbelts are there to help you keep control of yourself and the vehicle in reflex/emergency situations. If you have to slam on the brakes or swerve to avoid hitting something the seat belt keeps you from flopping all over the dashboard.</p>
<p>And if I hit something head on with enough velocity and not wearing a seatbelt, my chances of flying through the windshield are much higher, and in turn, my chances of injury or death are significantly higher.</p>
<p>In contrast, my chances of dying because I didn't put on a mask during the 20 foot walk from the restaurant entrance to my table are 0.</p>

        <p>Don't disagree but just FYI, seatbelts do keep others safe, if you have a high speed accident in the car and someone isn't wearing a seat belt, their body bounces around inside the car and can injure or even kill the other occupants.</p>

        <p>Seatbelts have been tested and retested and there are govt standards that the manufacturers, installers and repairers of them must maintain. Everything from their material, elasticity, attachment points, dyes used... It's all been tested AF.</p>
<p>There are no standards for "consumer" masks, especially the reusable ones. Jessica on Etsy met no standards with regard to fit, function, or fabric.</p>
<p>How air tight is the fit on every face? How do subtle facial adjustments, such as sticking out a chin slightly to allow for better breathing and better fit going to affect your jaw or teeth alignment over the long term with that mask?</p>
<p>How much is it filtering? How effective is the SpongeBob fabric at reducing viral spread? How much CO2 is it trapping behind it?  How much condensation is it collecting and how do you know when it has to much? How many microscopic things are living inside the mask after it has been on more than fifteen minutes? How much heat is it trapping? How does it react to stress and strenuous activity?</p>
<p>The person washing it at home (if they wash it), has no regulated guidelines as to how and with what kind of soap to wash it so as not to damage whatever untested functions it purports to have.  </p>
<p>Is the "rain fresh" scent from your underpants detergent really good to be breathing 8 hours a day from less than 2 mm from your nose? Are the fabric dyes or material offgassing safe to be breathing for that long, especially after being inundated with hot moist nose breath?</p>
<p>There are no standards for proper drying. Is mildew growing in there? Did the fabric pinch, wrinkle, bundle or rip even  microscopically to compromise efficacy?</p>
<p>Etc. Etc.etc. </p>
<p>There is an excellent segment on this week's Highwire where they interview 2 OSHA medical mask experts who basically destroy the whole "if a surgeon can do it so can you" argument. Check it out.</p>

        <p>This is what I was looking for. Could you imagine if these standards applied to seat belts? You'd have people making them from t shirts, bungee cords, leather belts, etc. There's no single standard for masks because they are completely ineffective.</p>

        <p>That's because they're strictly for compliance. Here's a trick next time you walk into a shop that requires a "face covering". Wear glasses. They cover your face. Not all of it, but neither do masks. If they hassle you, tell them their sign should have been more specific.</p>

        <p>“But ASIANS...” when before COVID, they only wore masks when they were sick or for poor air quality. People living in Japan who had no cold or flu symptoms didn’t wear a mask to Starbucks or the grocery store for the fun of it. </p>
<p>It was already said below, but also “Tell your (surgeon/dentist/etc.) not to wear one either!” Except they change their mask in between patients (and changed gloves and washed or sanitized their hands) and we have no idea if Karen in Walmart has even washed her mask since her state started a mandate in April. We also know how so many people think it’s cool to just litter their mask on the ground. Hospitals and doctor’s offices have specific waste containers for masks. Plus I don’t ever recall my dentist telling me she went shopping in a mask before COVID was here.</p>

        <p>A seatbelt is a working piece of safety equipment. The appropriate comparison would be a powered air respirator/cleansuit combination. </p>
<p>When they compare masks to seatbelts, it's like trying to say a chain of zipties is a sufficient "seatbelt."</p>

        <p>Masks are about forced compliance, especially on political enemies, and as a mark of conquer and humiliation. It's why very early on in the pandemic there was not much vitriol about mask use. As the issues became politically delineated those on the left figured out they can use it as a wedge (along with the entire pandemic) to gain control. I say this as a lifetime blue voter. It's the lowest our country has been in a long, long while.</p>

        <p>yes personally for me its not about the effectiveness of the mask. Its simply the symbolism of it.</p>
<p>For me its just such  a sign of submission to ''the new normal'' and something thats used to measure just how far they can get and how compliant  people are.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It dehumanizes people the same way people are dehumanized when driving cars. theres a reason everyone all aggressive nowadays the same way people get overly agressive in traffic. in masks were not humans were just another thing with no emotions</p>

        <p>This. No one was wearing them back in March when I was wearing one out of fear. Then the numbers started coming back, I realized I freaked out over nothing, was ready to get life back moving, and then our governor starts enforcing mask mandates. Now it's become a political issue, I feel like it's become their MAGA hat. They wear it out of solidarity and pitch it as an act of solidarity, instead of pitching it as an act of practicality. No wonder people are skeptical. </p>
<p>I stopped wearing my mask and give anyone who looks at me like I'm murdering someone a nice, big grin. You don't scare me, I scare you. I have the power.</p>

        <p>They stripped the left of all their power swiftly and dramatically. They have felt powerless for the past 4 years. Then they hand them a golden opportunity to virtue signal and dehumanize anyone who doesn't follow the narrative. You are now less than them. You are a 'plague rat' in their eyes. They are quenching their thirst for power with a destructive force, secretly hoping millions of people die so they can gain more power over their common man. It's all by design and it's all horribly evil and disgusting.</p>

        <p>I firmly believe in optional masks. The nice thing about optional masks is that when you see someone wearing one, you know that they are too stupid to get into a relationship with. I have fervently wished all my life that stupid people would brand themselves with a distinguishing mark and now they have one. I just don't want compulsory masks.</p>

        <p>Exactly. Where I live, as of now, masks are only recommended indoors and in public transit. Hopefully they will never be made mandatory. Some people wear masks, others don't. It's about 50/50 these days.</p>
<p>I wear a smug grin of my bare ass face every time I'm on the move. I look at people in masks, these thoughts come to mind:</p>
<p>- That person is full of fear. I have no wish to interact with people who fear life. Fear kills the immune system and ironically, I have no desire to be around sick people.</p>
<p>- That person is submissive to authority. I have no wish to interact with authoritarians.</p>
<p>- That persons seeks outside validation by virtue signalling. I have no wish to interact with people who's source of happiness is outside of themselves.</p>
<p>It's a good way to separate people with integrity and balls from the pussies.</p>
<p>I also don't give my money to businesses that require masks or don't accept cash.</p>

        <p>This is why I object to the designation of "anti-masker". It's a misnomer. I would personally take a bullet to protect anybody's right to wear a mask if that's what they need to feel safe/most in accordance with their true nature as they see it. The shaming, the abject expressions of horror/attempt to ruin the lives of people who don't wear a mask is something I can't accept or ever endorse. If you have billion/trillion dollar corporations and governments endorsing the dictates you feel comfortable with you forfeit every right to feel like the oppressed and aggressed against "minority" when you rail against those deviating from the sanctioned narrative... These would be Gulag plebs enforing the the narrative have more power than Jesus himself would ever have dreamed of.  You'd think they have the requisite humility demanded by the disparity in influence,unearned as it is, but it is nowhere to be found.</p>

        <p>Really good! Thanks!</p>
<p>I hate the meme where it shows how wearing a mask is like wearing pants and someone pees but it doesn’t get on you . . </p>
<p>It is really not comparable, but how do I explain why?</p>

        <p>I’d say by end of year masks will start to be on the chopping block in many places (outside of NY and CA). FL and a few states now have practically gone back to normal. Even in shutdown areas most people DGAF outside of wearing masks indoors in businesses.</p>

        <p>I'm pretty sure this is a reasonable position on the mask debate, just as it is when dealing with 'no shirt no service' laws:</p>
<p>If a private business demands I wear a mask...a shirt...a suit of roman legionary armour...they're totally within their rights to do that. I don't care, it's your business. Equally, if they want to say you can't smoke here, don't smoke. You'd have to have failed in your understanding of property not to get that in their house it's their rules.</p>
<p>The problem comes when it's a mandate. If a government mandates masks/a smoking ban/you must wear a shirt/battle armour, then it's infringing on the rights of the property owner as well as the customer.</p>

        <p>Masks can't be compared to clothing because most masks require a professional mask fit for a proper seal. You can pick your size of clothes but nothing happens if you get a shirt that's too small or too big on you. If your respirator doesn't have a perfect seal, particles can enter your respiratory pathway.</p>
<p>Having the government mandate masks but not instruct people on how to use them is the biggest farce in my opinion. I have had plenty of people walk into my work wearing a mask incorrectly. One lady specifically said "I thought the metal part goes over your chin".</p>
<p>If this virus was so deadly and a true zombie apocalypse, you wouldn't be wearing a fucking surgical mask.</p>

<p>Honestly if I could get away with it I'd never wear clothes again, but I can tolerate them okay. Masks are way more overwhelming like you said. Controlling your breathing is so important for anxiety, and masks take that away.</p>

<p><em>"wearing masks is as restrictive as wearing trousers, I feel so bad about not being able to shop naked."</em></p>

        <p>Even if you couldn't die of masks they still don't have an excuse to be rude about it. If they were right about masks not affecting your physical health, it still doesn't change the fact it may affect you mentally. Claustrophobia, anxiousness etc. are real. Some people needs to learn some empathy.</p>

        <p>I am pro mask, but anti lockdown, and yes I agree with you 100 percent. Masks can not be compared to wearing clothing. I also believe that masks shouldnt be required in places like bars right now, and only in places were you interact with high risk people like pharmacies, doctor offices, grocery stores, etc. But if your in a place where your not interacting with high risk people like bars, then they shouldn't be required</p>
