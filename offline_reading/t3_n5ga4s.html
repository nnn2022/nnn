    <strong>If you are in your late twenties or early thirties and live in the US, your chance of dying from the vaccine is almost 3 times higher than your chance of dying from covid.</strong>
    <p><p>I am trying to convince my girlfriend not to take the vaccine so I have been doing a bit of digging. I figured I would share what I found here because the data actually supports my argument a lot better than I expected it would. Please feel free to challenge my analysis and assumptions.</p>
<p>In the 54 weeks of data from March 2020 - March 2021 (I stopped here because death data can lag several weeks), a 25-34 year old had an <strong>average chance to die from covid of about 1 out of 775,862</strong> (this chance peaked at 1 out of 312,500 in the worst week)  <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#demographicsovertime">https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#demographicsovertime</a> </p>
<p>According to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, 53 people in the age group 30-39 have reportedly died after taking a covid-19 vaccine.  <a href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D8;jsessionid=441B971A91D0E9861D94D1EEB0A1">https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D8;jsessionid=441B971A91D0E9861D94D1EEB0A1</a> </p>
<p>Using 2019 U.S. Population estimates, about 13.456% of the U.S. population is aged 30-39.  <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-national-detail.html">https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-national-detail.html</a> </p>
<p>According to this article (supposedly updated yesterday, May 4), \~106,200,000 people in the U.S. are fully vaccinated.  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html">https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html</a> </p>
<p>So, assuming the demographics of vaccinated people match those of the U.S., that means .13456 * 106,200,000 = 14,290,568 vaccinated people of age 30-39</p>
<p>Reducing the fraction: 53 deaths / 14,290,568 vaccinated   <strong>= 1 out of 269,633 vaccinated died</strong></p>
<p>So if you are young, your chance of dying from the vaccine is almost 3 times that of dying from covid. This doesn't even include health, as all comorbidities are included in the covid death figures.</p></p>
