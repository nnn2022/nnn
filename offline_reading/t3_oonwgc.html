    <strong>If the Covid-19 was manufactured, I believe the most probable origin to be Fort Detrick, Maryland</strong>
    <p><p>Do you remember "vaping disease"?</p>
<p>Do you remember that strange pneunomia that people got in the US in late summer 2019?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>I remember people being admitted to hospitals with pneunomia, fever and vomiting, that could not be diagnosed as any previous illness.</p>
<p>It's a fact that covid-19 and vaping disease have such similar overlap in x-rays, that doctors are suggested to diagnose based on clinical examination, not radiography:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7309841/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7309841/</a></p>
<p>&rt;Ultimately, the greatest likelihood of successfully distinguishing COVID-19 pneumonia from EVALI (like the provided examples in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7309841/figure/fig0001/">Fig. 1</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7309841/figure/fig0002/">Fig. 2</a> which were seen in a single ED shift), lies with open communication between radiologist and ED clinician; that is, <strong>suggestive imaging findings are combined with direct patient questioning regarding recent use of e-cigarettes, COVID exposures etc.</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>If you vape = vaping disease.</li>
<li>If you don't vape = covid?</li>
</ul>
<p>Suddenly vaping disease disappeared... just when Covid kicked in.</p>
<p>Now what does that have to do with the US military base in Fort Detrick, Maryland?</p>
<p>Well, you see, Fort Detrick was home to research in germs and bioweapons.</p>
<p>It was shut down in <strong>July 2019:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/05/health/germs-fort-detrick-biohazard.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/05/health/germs-fort-detrick-biohazard.html</a></p>
<p>&rt;Aug. 5, 2019 <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Safety concerns at a prominent military germ lab have led the government to shut down research involving dangerous microbes like the Ebola virus.</p>
<p>Later that year, the World Military Games were held in Wuhan in October.</p>
<p>Several athletes have claimed to be sick during their stay there.</p>
<p>To me, this seems something that has to be investigated. I'm not saying it's what happened for sure.</p>
<p>I'm saying that a strange pneunomia in the US overlapping with closing a military bioweapon facility, then 2 months later, a disease spreading to military personel in Wuhan, that is something that needs to be investigated.</p></p>

        <p>The only thing  can say, in February 2018 I fell sick. I thought it was some kind of heavy flu even if it felt totally different than the flu, but i had the same symptoms as given to covid now. Could barely breath, or to walk, lost totally my smell, had headache, and was in bed for a good 2 weeks ...  </p>
<p>Edit: I don't vape tho</p>

        <p>That sounds like too early for covid or even vaping.</p>
<p>The first registered vaping illness was April 2019.</p>
<p>You probably had the 2018 killer flu, I had it as well and it was absolutely brutal. I was sick for almost 10 days and took 30 days to recover.</p>
<p>The 2018 flu killed tons of people, almost as many as covid.</p>

        <p>I would say either fort detrick or chapel hill. In January of 2019 the doj indicated 2 or 3 (if my memory serves me) Chinese nationals for attempting to smuggle “genetic materials” back to China. Both of which were part of the PLA and were Chinese genetic researchers.</p>

        <p>I remember being very uneasy about the reports of vaping disease, like something wasn't right. I vape, and I settled on the theory that those people had been vaping cartridges full of vitamin E acetate or THC oil. I had no fear that my own vaping practices would bring that kind of harm. It was extremely suspicious and opened my eyes to the uncalled for fear that the media spreads. Then event 201 played out and I heard no more about vaping illness. </p>
<p>Your theory is highly plausible. There are small things that cause cognitive dissonance, but people paid high salaries to manufacture a narrative are not going to make it easily debunked. Governments are continuing to go after vaping, probably because it is taking money away from one of the 1%'s cash cows.</p>
