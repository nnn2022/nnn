        <p>I have been on Reddit for 6months now and I not even once looked at anyone’s profile. Like wtf? Why would you do that? Some of them even go super deep and scroll way down at posts I had long forgotten about and then hold them against you, when it has literally nothing to do with OP.</p>

        <p>Shit like that is why you don't ask for advice on Reddit: a lot of Redditors are really goddamn petty. Combine that with the fact that they don't know you enough as a person to give you objective feedback and you'll be in for a world of hurt if you take their Ouija board suggestions seriously.</p>

        <p>In regards to your original post, I don’t think it can be answered by strangers on this type of forum.  I will try to give you something I hope you find meaningful.<br>
Taking care of your self is the top priority, being honest with yourself and having an internal dialogue is key to finding out who you really are.  Once you are comfortable with who you are, project that outward into the world, that’s where you lose control of how others perceive you.  If you perceive a conversation isn’t going well maybe ask the other person outright if they are enjoying the conversation.  Hope this helps.</p>

        <p>I was recently diagnosed with ASD which sort of explains why I'm so shit in social situations and introverted. For me it feels like everyone is unintentionally playing out some boring soap opera or drama that I don't have any interest in or be apart of.</p>
<p>I'm not sure exactly why I come across as so off putting to people I think it has a lot to do with how you engage in the conversation and how inclusive you are of them as well as overall body language. I find I always try to end conversations as quickly as possible as I find them confronting.</p>

        <p>Based on your comments and a little of your post history you come off as way too sensitive which is a really off putting trait in women. My advice is to start eating right, start working out and start working on having a positive mental attitude. It's not healthy for women to have a r/childfree mindset no matter what dumbass redditors tell you. You need to get more in touch with the real world, drop the dopamine machines, uninstall things like tik tok and instagram if you have them and to start putting yourself out there. You're almost 30 and if you feel like a foreveralone woman right now, it's not going to get any better if you don't make some serious improvements in your life. </p>
<p>Last thoughts, if you do even half of the things I suggested you'll see an improvement in your mental health and outlook on life. I'd suggest watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU_W0oE_ock8bWKjALiGs8Q">Charisma on Command</a> to help improve your social skills and get an understanding into the psychology behind human interaction. Finally, if you don't want people critiquing your lifestyle don't put it all online. Yeah the guy with the mask comment was kind of a ret@rd but he had a point with the second part of his comment. Masks suck ass and are dehumanizing, but you're not doing yourself any favors with the ideologies you find yourself subscribing to like anti-natalism and not caring about others.</p>
<p>I hope this comment is a little dose of reality that helps you better understand the world around you.</p>

        <p>Jesus Christ. That one post in r/socialskills was about something in REAL life. Not online. I am a completely different person in real life, which is unfortunate because the people who give me advice here only see the top of the iceberg and my little „post history“ on Reddit. They don’t know that I am donating money in real life, that I have created a network for people supporting each other irl, and many other good things I’m doing I don’t want to brag about but apparently have to because people 11 out of 10 times think they know and could judge you, instead of just sticking to one single post.</p>
