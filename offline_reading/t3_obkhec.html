        <p>The chap below who says that the "the way you feel about flat-earthers is the same way the mask freaks feel about you"....</p>
<p>I respectfully disagree. I love a conspiracy as much as the next guy, but to me the current flat-earther movement is based upon delusion. It relies upon so many other fundamental principles of physics and astronomy being incorrect that there is no debate in my opinion.</p>
<p>However, the COVID hysteria has been bent out of proportion by politics as much as scientific fact. Look at the blatant logical fallacies demonstrated in this video. In the first few seconds a bloke is spraying his drink with some sort of disinfectant. Any reasoned person would assess and come to the conclusion that ingesting anti-bacterial agents is far likely to be harmful to your health than COVID. </p>
<p>I do agree with your general point as well. The COVID hype is harrowingly similar to the current flat earth mob. Unfortunately, the difference is that the COVID mob is accepted and embraced by the mainstream which is in turn completely fucking over all our lives.</p>

        <p>I think he means when we started hearing about flat earthers again. They basically didn't exist, they were so few, but there was a "random" surge in anti-flat-earther sentiment starting a couple of years ago. Came out of seemingly nowhere.</p>
<p>This was used to reignite sentiment against "conspiracy theorists", which we said said to be.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't frame it like that because I'm not claiming that I know the earth is flat. Rather I would bring up things that call into question the current heliocentric model of the universe and the mainstream depiction of "space." </p>
<p>One of the most compelling is simply the fact that we can see much further than should be possible based on the calculation for the curvature of the earth. You can look up videos of people using NikonP900 cameras zooming in on ships that have "went over the curve" and bring them completely back into view. </p>
<p>There's also the fact that despite the fact that the earth is supposedly traveling 66,000 mph in an elliptical orbit, yet we don't feel any force. Angular motion is by definition acceleration and F=MA. Even if you are traveling at a constant speed in your car, you feel force when you turn because that is acceleration. Imagine turning at 66,000 mph in a circle constantly. </p>
<p>There there is the mountain of evidence of how fake NASA is, from the moon landings to the ISS. The ISS is supposedly orbiting around earth at 10 times the speed of a bullet, and we are able to send astronauts up and dock on it. There are countless videos showing that objects are photoshopped into ISS videos, and the women's hair is clearly permed and stands straight up in relation to their body no matter what position they are in. NASA officially claims that they lost the technology to go to the moon and haven't been able to build it back up again, and that is the reason we have not gone to the moon in 50 years, and no other country has either. </p>
<p>The coriolis effect is the concept that when a bullet is fired, the earth moves underneath it. Why then does an airplane not also experience a coriolis effect? If a plane is landing on a north-south runway, why is the runway not moving 1000 miles per hour underneath them based on the rotation of the earth?</p>
<p>Other things would be that every image of the earth is clearly photoshopped and this is even admitted by NASA. The blue marble photo even has the same exact cloud patterns photoshopped over and over again. </p>
<p>Why do we see the same stars at night no matter the time of year even though we are supposedly on the other side of the sun 6 months later and looking out at an entirely different direction of the universe?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Maybe people will be mad on this sub for me talking about this here but I beg anyone with an open mind to look into it. I'm not a "flat earther" but the earth is definitely not a ball that is spinning 1000 mph and going around the sun at 66,000 mph, and I'm fairly certain no one has ever been into "space." If you spend any amount of time looking into it with an honestly open mind, it will become quite obvious.</p>

        <p>Yeah I honestly don't know what to make of it all but there are a lot of problems with the current paradigm and our understanding of the Earth and Space. All of the ideas and theories should continue to be debated and not censored. If you look into it, make sure to avoid the "Flat Earth Society," as they are a disinformation site that is artificially boosted to the top of google and youtube search results to give a false depiction of what flat earthers believe. It was, interestingly, mentioned by Obama a bunch of times in pre-written speeches as well. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Look into it with an open mind. Make it a point to actually debunk any questions to the current heliocentric model, and see if the answers actually satisfy you without just going "well the people that are smarter than me said so."</p>

        <p>You make a lot of interesting points. My problem with these ideas is that this sounds convincing to an uneducated layman like myself but for all I know a physicist could come in here and debunk every single one of your points. But yeah a part of me has always felt the flat earthers are right but I've never seen any smoking gun evidence. It definitely looks flat when you fly in a plane.</p>

        <p>Take it as an exercise, you should be able to listen to and debate for something you do not believe in.  </p>
<p>Doing so you'll see patterns like the one you're simulating:  </p>
<p>Dismiss an antivax or flat earth theory because it's wildly dismissed by the masses.  </p>
<p>Dismiss an antivax or flat earth theory with an appeal to authority.   </p>
<p>Dismiss an antivax or flat earth theory with insults, threats, lies, strawmen etc.  </p>
<p>Recognizing the process is just as important as the facts and theories being discussed.</p>

        <p>The reason I appealed to authority is I just feel that if the Earth was flat there would be some wacko scientist raving about it somewhere with actual credentials and big research money. I'm just asking for a "smoking gun" source before I'll believe it. It does make me suspicious that Youtube goes out of its way to cite the Wikipedia page for Flat Earth on any Flat Earth video. They don't even do that shit for Illuminati videos but for some reason they're worried about misinformation with Flat Earth? It's just a hard pill to swallow for me. Wouldn't every pilot have to be in on it then? They would all have to use Flat Earth maps.</p>

        <p>I don't hold any particular position on this, but there are a number of pilots out there who claim the earth is flat (though they tend not to be the ones that cram it down anyone who'll listens throat). My fiances step brother was the one who introduced the notion of a flat earth to me a few christmases ago during a rather interesting chat about reality. He got his commercial license the year prior and claimed to have never seen curvature from the cockpit; just a big, flat plane with what seems to be a finite rendering distance. He also mentioned bringing things into view that are supposedly over the horizon, using a powerful enough DSLR. 
Interesting! Though without seeing any of this for myself I avoid drawing any conclusions.</p>

        <p>They change a little bit but they don't completely change. There are stars which are visible all year-round. You only see stars at night, and during night time, the dark side of the earth is facing completely away from the sun. 6 months later, the earth will be on the complete opposite side of the sun. So during night time at that time, the dark side of the earth is facing in a completely different direction from where it was 6 months ago, looking out at an entirely different section of the universe. Meaning it should basically be a completely different sky with completely different stars.</p>

        <p>Goes to show you why the education system is the least bit of education and more so indoctrination. If it was eduction about life itself, children wouldn't hate it. But it's what the entire world says is they way so they do it. Then to realize it was only there to stop you from thinking or being curious.</p>
<p>The sooner they have people trapped in either obligations or perceived responsibilities, the harder it is for people to break their chains. Especially when it's attached to our modern day social ideologies.</p>
<p>The internet has changes humans for better and worse. I was able to learn while others buried themselves in porn and games. Did my own fair share until I'd realized it was that all along that changes they way my brain comprehended life itself. Lust over disconnected human meaning.</p>

        <p>The education model in the states is a total failure and disgrace. I think the cracks were made ever more apparent during the ludicrous lockdowns and "shelter-in-place" orders here. Zoom schooling was literally the worst that public schools could offer. No wonder millennials are seemingly the worst in terms of staying in lockstep with the health fascists--they've been through so many terrifying "shelter-in-place" orders at public school because of the mass shooting hysteria that they are complacent about itMy family will continue to wing it and do a combo of homeschooling and private school (my 11 year old is going to a one day a week outdoor adventure school). I feel they will be far more critical thinkers and away from the insane cultural relativism and militaristic regimentation by not attending public schools. I've also become a hardcore (leftish)-libertarian because of Covid and think the lack of school choice in the US is criminal.</p>

<p>The point you're missing is that the education model has been a total success, it was designed to produce exactly the results that you're seeing. Read up on John Dewey and his associates and read what they said about transforming public education, and what they believed the end result should be. 100 years later and we're living during the successful culmination of their efforts to subvert education.</p>

        <p>It's funny, I told myself I wouldn't be having any children unless I could teach them the meaning of the world itself, because I wasn't about to just blindly assume everything I could see was right. There was something incredibly off with everything I'd seen. People blind an unaware about why they do what they do. Then, bam, I learned it. Fuck was it painful.</p>
<p>Now I'm spending a percentage of my time trying to articulate a truth about autism that isn't know. Something the public education system is doing. Instilling us that we're less than everyone else. Nothing could be further from the truth. Revealing how everything we'd been told was only to keep everyone controlled. The most genuine of people suffer the most. That's why it sometimes pushes them to resentment and world burning mentalities.</p>
<p>I thought to myself, if I was to structure a better education system, how would I do it? I glanced at Elon's Ad Astra, that was it. Then to only suspect he'd been diagnosed with Aspergers to which I was as well. Only to have him reveal that on SNL. Sitting there thinking, I fucking called it....</p>

        <p>I've seen different videos of schools having band practice while wearing masks and thats the most ironic part to me! In this video you see a girl using a woodwind clarinet with her mask on.... if you can blow through your mask to play a wind instrument, do you really think it's blocking out any virus particles? Straight up lunacy.</p>
