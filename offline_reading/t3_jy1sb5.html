    <strong>Why the mRNA vaccines terrify me, and why I’m NEVER getting one</strong>
    <p><p>Forgive this extremely long post, but I have to get this information out there. For anyone willing to read until the end, thank you.</p>
<p>Now, we’ve all seen the mainstream media outlets being selective about the information they present regarding these mRNA vaccines. The companies spearheading this effort (namely Biontech, Pfeizer and Moderna) continue to boast their over 90% success rates, further giving the public reason to inject a rushed vaccine, using never-before-seen technology, available for human use in just under one year. Indeed, the mRNA technology has been in development for 30 years now with plenty of unsuccessful animal trials, and no human trials until this year!</p>
<p>The Powers That Be have effectively been able to take away the livelihoods, liberties and rights of billions of people with no accountability. Millions, if not billions of people have been overcome with desperation, depression, anxiety, hopelessness, poverty, and cynicism. It’s come to the point where many people acquiesce to these tyrannical restrictions, exclaiming to those around them, “Ugh, I can’t wait to just get that <strong>vaccine</strong> to go back to my normal life!” </p>
<p>This sentiment alarms me, because it accepts a false dichotomy of either unending, sporadic lockdowns or a vaccine imposed upon you by authoritarian governments that don’t really care about your health. It disgusts me that people are being forced into accepting one or the other. This alarm led me down a rabbit hole to studying the pathology of protein diseases, and to try figuring out why TPTB want to primarily use an mRNA vaccine so badly.</p>
<p><strong>What Are Prion Proteins?</strong></p>
<p>Proteins that <strong>prions</strong> are made of PrPc, or prion protein, are normal proteins which occur mainly in the nervous system but are found throughout other tissues in the body. The infectious kind is called PrPsc. When misfolding of proteins occur, it becomes a malignant agent known as a prion, with the ability to transmit their misfolded shape onto normal variants of the same protein. Other proteins can exhibit prion-like behavior, but I’ll touch on that later.</p>
<p><strong>What Are Prion Diseases? </strong></p>
<p>According to the CDC, prions are considered “abnormal, pathogenic agents that are transmissible and are able to induce <strong>abnormal folding</strong> of specific normal cellular proteins called <strong>prion proteins</strong> that are found most abundantly in the brain.” Even the CDC admits, “the functions of these normal prion proteins are still not completely understood.” Mad cow disease is probably the most well-known of the prion diseases, but neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s and certain forms of dementia have been revealed to be forms of prion disease as well. What’s terrifying about prion diseases is it’s highly infectious nature within the body. Just a singular prion can collapse nearby proteins into the same misfolded shape. This linear progression of protein collapse leads to disease. Oh, and guess what? Although prion disease is rare, it is <strong>fatal 100% of the time. </strong></p>
<p>What’s important to note is that prion diseases have an <strong>exceptionally long incubation period. </strong> You can have prion disease and go five to up to twenty years without noticing signs of disease. However, once the proteins multiply and aggregate into <strong>amyloids,</strong> collections of these misfolded proteins, they collect in overabundance between nerve tissue, lead to a rapid deterioration in health, and <strong>unavoidable</strong> death.
So, little is known about PrP, why proteins misfold into prions and why amyloids lead to disease. It’s been discovered that other proteins, such as amyloid beta (implicated in Alzheimer’s disease) can misfold and lead to prion diseases. And, surprise surprise, little is known about why this happens as well. Does this mean other proteins, not just protease-resistant proteins, are capable of exhibiting prion-like behavior and causing disease?</p>
<p><strong>The role of Phosphatidylethanolamine and mRNA</strong></p>
<p>This word is way too long, so from now on I’ll be referring to phosphatidylethanolamine as <strong>PDT.</strong></p>
<p>PDT is a lipid found in all living beings. When PDT in food undergoes the Maillard reaction (what happens when food is browned and makes it taste so good, like cookies, breads, steak, etc) it rearranges into a more toxic form called an amadori product. Amadori-PDT’s cause oxidative stress and are higher in foods high in sugar, fat, and cooked to high temperatures. It’s also present in processed foods. You know, all that bad shit you shouldn’t be eating.</p>
<p>On a personal note—I’m not a believer in completely ridding yourself of these foods. I believe in balance, and as long as one strives to eat foods rich in nutrients and antioxidants to combat foods causing oxidative stress, you can lead a healthy, balanced life. Your body was designed to do just that!</p>
<p>Now, where am I going with this? How does it relate to prion disease? Well, guess what…PDT’s have been discovered to be a significant co-factor in propagation of infectious prions. This also makes me think about the standard diet in the majority of developed countries, and how these diets are rife with Amadori-PDTs. Why, instead of educating the public about the importance of nutrients and antioxidants, do they aggressively push the need for a vaccine? </p>
<p>Not only are PDTs a cofactor, but polyanions (single strand <strong>RNA molecules</strong>) are a crucial factor in the production of infectious prions. Without that single strand RNA, prions won’t have that high level of infectivity. </p>
<p><strong>How this all relates to the vaccine</strong></p>
<p>Although the vaccines appear to be shrouded in mystery, the companies do give us this bit of information: the vaccine uses messenger RNA to essentially “hijack” cells and encode it with the information to produce spike proteins. Cool, right? Except this coding is coming from the outside in, to create a protein from the inside out. A protein your body <strong>doesn’t naturally produce</strong> (I may be wrong on this). It’s bad enough that scientists admit the presence of foreign RNA could lead to an inflammatory response, thereby leading to autoimmune conditions that may permanently disable you. Either way, they’re taking advantage of the public’s ignorance and claiming that this is all just a natural process of your body (making proteins), there’s nothing to worry about, and that the vaccines are over 90% effective. </p>
<p>Side note—what are they considering effectiveness? The presence of antibodies? Because sure, they very well could be present, but what about how the incredibly complex ribosomes of your cells get altered by this RNA? </p>
<p>So, my questions are this. Why are we artificially introducing mRNA to change the way our cells express proteins? How do we know these proteins <strong>don’t have the potential to be malformed?</strong> We are aware the Standard Western Diet already has major health implications in neurodegenerative diseases, among other diseases (including COVID!!!), why aren’t we advocating for healthy, balanced living? How many of these shots do people need to take throughout their lifetime? Why is the vaccine being so rushed when a potential disease to come of this new technology has an incubation period of at least five years? How do we know this vaccine can’t cause that? Why use this technology for COVID-19, a disease with an over 99% survival rate for the majority of the population? Why aren’t we opting for focused protection of the vulnerable? Why is it so hard to get a definitive answer if these vaccines will be mandatory? Why are our livelihoods being, essentially, held hostage?</p>
<p>Why now?</p>
<p>The risk to reward ratio doesn’t make sense. <strong>All this for a disease with a 99% survival rate for the majority?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Final Thoughts/Conspiracy Time</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps I’m drawing too many conclusions in linking this RNA vaccine to potential prion disease. Still, you’re interfering with the natural mechanism of protein production in the body. Why would you want to tamper with such complex and delicate biological machinery, which creates dozens, if not hundreds of the most complex compounds in your body? Remember, it only takes a small amount of malformed proteins to progress into fatal disease. Imagine giving these vaccines to a child and this happens. A child that’s 5 years old and needs this mRNA vaccine to go to school. What if these spike proteins develop into prions and now their life expectancy is 25 years old? Could the world be seeing a mass extinction within the next 5 to 20 years from these vaccines?</p>
<p>I’m also aware that the Gates and his family are known eugenicists, and there are theories floating around that TPTB want to cull the population by over 90%. It makes sense for them to permanently take away any sense of normalcy for the global population and giving them a promise to return to normal by getting one little harmless shot. It sounds so appealing. It’s <strong>mass psychological warfare,</strong> and they know it.</p>
<p>And no, I don’t believe the vaccine will take away your humanity, turn you away from God, or keep you from getting into heaven. I know TPTB have finessed the public into thinking the only people that are against vaccines are "religious nuts", selfish idiot “Trumptards”, and woo-woo essential oil people that are “against science” and under the unfortunate influence of "vaccine hesitancy and misinformation." Well, guess what. I was enlisted in the U.S. Air Force for four years stationed at a combat control squadron. I got injected with every vaccine known to man (with the exception of smallpox, since, ironically, the military knows it could give me a fatal reaction due to my eczema). I’m <strong>never</strong> getting this mRNA vaccine. It’s not the concept of vaccines that scare me, <strong>it’s the new technology. </strong> </p>
<p>I would rather wear a mask for the rest of my life and never leave my house than be subject to this vaccine.</p>
<p>We are all capable of living happy, healthy, abundant lives through diets rich in nutrients, exercise, mindfulness and stress management. My body is biologically fine-tuned to thrive on these pillars of healthy living, and I refuse to let TPTB fool me into thinking my body is incapable of protecting itself, especially from a virus such as this. It's not even 100% clear whether asymptomatic transmission is even a thing. </p>
<p>I can’t be one of those people that just goes “Just let the doomers terrified of COVID take the vaccine so we can all move on with our lives.”  Everyone needs to be aware of the potential dangers of this vaccine. The dangers that the mainstream media refuse to touch upon, because TPTB won’t allow it.</p>
<p>Please, do your own research to decide for yourself if this is worth it. We have had too many instances of “trusting the science” too quickly that lead to biological and environmental disasters. I can’t let this be another one of those instances.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> mRNA vaccine changes the way your body makes proteins. Possible prion disease connection? Who knows? I don't trust it.</p></p>
