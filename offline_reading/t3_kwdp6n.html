    <strong>I don't understand this subreddit but I'm willing to learn</strong>
    <p><p>Different account just incase you guys hate me.
I don't get the against masks business but I'm always willing to learn. I wear masks when I go into shops and I believe in staying home but I'm not gonna try and force my thoughts on you guys I just want to learn why your against masks. This community seems actually really positive and I don't want to disrupt that I would just love it to be explained to me so I can get the other side of the story from the people on the other side rather then being told by the media "anti mask bad"</p></p>

        <p>I am refusing to use a mask because for 35 years of my life my immune system has done just fine, I’m not dismissing the fact that people may want to wear a mask that is fine with me. Just don’t force your choices on to me, also other recent actions such as the WHO changing the parameters of what constitutes a pandemic (removing mortality rate as a defining parameter of a pandemic) and the literal changing of the definition of Herd Immunity to fit their narrative makes me extremely suspicious of their intentions. Also this is not the first time the government have tried to sell us on this bullshit of pandemics, like Swine Flu, Bird Flu and CJD (Mad Cow Disease) all turned out to be nowhere near as deadly as first thought. The main difference there was the MSM (especially Channel 4) were very skeptical of these “pandemics” and called the government on their lies, back when journalists had integrity that is!</p>
<p>During my life I’ve faced 3 economic recessions and 4 “pandemics” all brought on by elitist filth in the government and banking sectors and god knows who else that has their fingers in the pie!</p>
<p>If you actually trust that any government has your best interests at heart and they actually care about you, you’re in for a rude awakening.</p>

<p>If you are sick, STAY HOME.</p>
<p>I’d honestly be okay with the public shaming and ridicule of people out who are obviously symptomatic.  I still don’t want to see anyone fined or arrested.  But maybe we can shout at them and throw peanuts or something.  Hell I’ve been doing this my whole life minus the shouting and peanuts).  I fucking hate seeing some asshole drag themselves or their sick kids out somewhere, it burns me up.</p>

        <p>I'm personally not anti-mask; I am anti-using general lockdowns as a cover for the destruction of the health service by the uber-rich and their bandit ministers. It's not fair that, because they looted billions from the treasury, <em>we</em> now have to suffer because <em>our</em> health service is overran when <em>they</em> - the people responsible for reducing its capacity - holiday in St Barts.</p>
<p>General lockdowns serve no medical purpose beyond preventing our health services being overran (healthy under-60s are at minimal risk from the virus itself), but they are - according to the UN; WFP; World Bank, and others - set to kill tens of millions worldwide through starvation; missed medical treatment; war; conflict; unrest, and the generational after-effects of poverty. So, I think avoiding them where possible to be the best course of action.</p>

<p>Once this is over, it could well be "the Covid pandemic cost us billions, and we had to lockdown to save the NHS which was at breaking point. We can't have that again so we need to increase taxes, which will help everyone to Save The NHS, and/or we'll have to sell off parts to private companies (Trump needs something to do now) as the NHS is not fit for purpose if it can't cope with Covid-catch-22".</p>

        <p>I'm not necessarily against masks, I'm just against them being mandated by the government.</p>
<p>Masks certainly can help and do serve a purpose. But the notion that they're this cure-all for the virus is silly. The vast majority of people who wear masks are wearing them improperly, storing them improperly, incessantly touching them, and not wearing a quality that's truly effective, thus neutering their usefulness. Wearing a mask this way is often worse than no mask at all. But media, social media, and the general populous will act like you're an amazing, selfless hero for wearing a dirty old piece of cloth on your face, and an absolutely selfish, murderous monster for not wearing one. It's ridiculous.</p>
<p>In addition, mask mandates always come with social distance requirements and a slew of other restrictions. These mandates and restrictions actively contribute to massive spikes in unemployment, poverty, homelessness, terrible education, missed health screenings, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, domestic abuse, depression, anxiety, suicide, and a myriad of other issues.</p>
<p>What it really boils down to for me is personal responsibility. Protect any of your elderly and/or vulnerable, if they want you to. Take any and all personal precautions you find necessary to feel safe. Don't force your fear and paranoia onto others, disproportionately harming the young and/or not overly vulnerable in the process.</p>
<p>Finally, not everyone here is necessarily anti-mask. We just disagree on the measures taken to combat the virus, since the "cure" is much worse than the virus itself, at this point.</p>

        <p>Masks are the most obvious and personally invasive aspect of the global circus that has been the covid19 pandemic. From what I have seen come out of the USA they dehumanise us and become psychologically fetishised and end up in an extreme US <em>vs</em> THEM position, like football fans ready to riot. An obsession with masks literally reduces the scope of what we should all be thinking about to only face value.</p>

        <p>I really don't care about the masks. If I have to wear one, I will. I think it says an awful lot about the seeds that are being sown when people can't disagree with something without being labeled a conspiracy theorist, anti mask anti vax. </p>
<p>What i dont like is what I dont understand, and I dont understand why it has been accepted that everything other than covid no longer matters. I dont understand how people are able to just turn a blind eye to the suffering that is being caused by the lockdowns. I dont understand how people who do think about the suffering caused by lockdowns are classed as selfish. </p>
<p>I dont understand why they feel the need to constantly push fear on to us, with no shred of positivity. I dont understand why they are not offering vitamin d and stuff to those who are vulnerable. I dont understand how everything I learned about building an immune system is now classed as bad. Everything they suggest we do, are things that actually suppress the immune system and that doesn't make sense to me. </p>
<p>I dont understand why its constantly assumed that people who dont agree are thought of as not caring about others or saving lives, when all I see is these people trying to ensure that ALL lives are looked at, and not just covid.</p>

        <p>I'm against the masks for several reasons, the main one being that despite the fact that it's now mandated in almost the entire world people keep getting sick. It's obviously not helping and yet lots of people see them as a universal solution to the problem. They are a complement at best. </p>
<p>It also does a lot to how you perceive the world. I'm not denying that covid exists by any means, but I think the reaction to it is excessive. The masks keep reminding me that the world is upside down and I don't like that, it makes me sad and worried. That's why I don't want masks to be normalized. This is not ebola or the black death.</p>

        <p>Do you have to wear a mask 6-10 hours per day in order to make a living? Just curious because they're a lot easier to wear for a short trip into a store. They started mandating masks AND face shields at my job and my body and mind straight up rejected the mask. I felt like I was suffocating. I had a full panic attack. Hyperventilating and hysterical crying. I am not at all prone to emotional outbursts. The face shield wrapped around my head gave me a splitting headache. I thought I was coming down with covid symptoms until I moved the face shield way up and my headache was relieved. Thankfully my work decided that since we aren't open to the public we only have to wear masks if we get up from our desks or can't "social distance" in the back room. No face shields. </p>
<p>I decided to research whether surgical or homemade tshirt masks work. They absolutely do not. They will not stop viruses, they will only stop bacteria and fungi. Viruses will go STRAIGHT THROUGH in both directions. The bacteria, fungi, and viruses also get stuck on the mask, inside and outside, so they need to be replaced constantly. If you aren't constantly replacing your mask with a fresh one, masks will actually MAKE you sick. </p>
<p>I don't care what anyone else does, but being called an anti masker because I don't like wearing them or seeing them is a bit over the top.</p>

<p>Chronicles U-turns and narrative shift of mask use straight from the mouths of those who we are told to listen to (government medical advisors, WHO, world leaders etc.) Watch and ask yourself:</p>
<ol>
<li>Was this a genuine change of opinion among scientific communities, was more research done in those six months that justifies this volte-face?</li>
<li>If so where can I find it?</li>
<li>If I don’t believe this really is based on scientific research, which time were all these people lying?</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the crux of the matter for me. It’s not so much whether masks work, it’s what they represent. They are a quick and easy way to measure overall compliance at a glance, they remind everyone they need to live in fear, they remind me of how easily the population has been manipulated and that worries me. </p>
<p>I’m not a big rebel or a lawbreaker (at least I wasn’t until they made EVERYTHING illegal). I choose to wear it when asked, but I always write some sort of snarky slogan on mine in marker pen to remind people that they need to remember to ask these questions.</p>

        <p>Hope this thread illuminates some of the different perspectives between us and that we still respect each other’s perspective. </p>
<p>At its heart, I define this thread as common sense—asking questions, and pointing out hypocrisy,  those that have imposed harms far and wide through decisions and policies that have no effect on them.  That science isn’t a controlled randomized study but based on feels.  That people can be painted as one thing because of a single reasoned view—stigmatizing  us as the detestable.</p>
<p>Masks are fine but mostly worthless if not fit tested, n95, free of moisture and changed frequemtly (15 min has been the science for the 15 years I’ve been studying or practicing as a nurse).  Masking little kids, moist covering, covering when outside, inappropriate donning and taking off pose quantifiable risks. It’s insanity.</p>
<p>Value judgements of those who make choices contrary to the “mandates” has fractured society’s common empathy.  Today on the radio, a lady was freaking bc she was “exposed” to covid from a masked coworker.  She was livid, insecsed that her coworker had the audacity to take a vacation to Mexico with her husband (where she contracted virus presumably). She rages that “how selfish, her husband is sick with MS, and she’s traveling with him and risking virus—now I’m quarantined (no positive).  As the lady raged (and was cheered for her righteous indignation), all u thought of is why that couple traveled.  My perspective was instantly—they traveled bc he doesn’t know how much time they have left to do that.  It was not a deliberate malicious journey, but an assessment of risk v reward. Husband was high risk, and they still chose that because life circumstances. </p>
<p>This is the same rationale choice (risk), we have denied elderly here since March.  The 90 year old locked in her room, desperately longs to spend “her last days with her grandkids”.  Human touch removed.  </p>
<p>The worst thing I have and continue to experience is the death in isolation.  At the end of life, we have banned going on a year the human need for closure at the end.  We have the PPE now and families willing to sign waivers for the chance to hold their loved one as they leave this world.  Dying alone is a fate so unnatural and cruel.  The desperation and helplessness by those left behind are wounds that won’t heal. Witnessing this human tradgexy daily strips away something necessary from those who provide care.</p>
<p>All these things are risks but they are risks that can not be decried as one single way—bad.  Grandparents who have spent the last 10 months unable to meet and hold their grandchild, kids as young as 5 denied any socialization while they are forced to “kearn” on a screen for 5 hrs a day.  Only children with no playmates. Teens separating from all the experiences so vital for their lifelong mental well-being—denied the opportunities that define who they become. Forced with no choice they watch as the privledged send their kids to private schools, hire tutors, buy endless entertainment.  No end in sight, and endless hypocrisy.</p>

        <p>Well, first, thank you for being willing to listen.  Thank you.</p>
<p>The mask thing is simple.  Before 2020, everyone knew that the only one responsible for his or her health is him or her.  I am responsible for my health and mine alone.  I have traveled the world multiple times.  I've sailed on giant aircraft carriers carrying 5,000 to 6,000 people each all locked up in tight compartments all breathing the same air.  I've been exposed to more viruses than I'll ever be able to count.  And I'm still here.  You accept the risk and you strengthen your immune system so that you can face what's out there.  This is how most people lived before 2020.  This is how I still live.</p>
<p>Then comes 2020 and I'm supposed to just accept that all businesses need to close for our own safety and people need to be fired, laid off, or kept from working until they run out of money and are unable to feed their children all the while being forced to wear a stupid mask because our immune systems can no longer be trusted?  No.  I'm not accepting that.  </p>
<p>I am an essential worker (thank the gods!) and I work at a hospital.  I wear a mask because they pay my salary, but outside work?  Hell no.  I've been exposed to Covid already and I've read every article.  I've looked at the tests and I've read the testing manuals.  I have studied.  And there's no evidence of reinfection.  None.  So I see no reason to follow the fear porn and pretend to be afraid of something that has already failed to kill me.  </p>
<p>Basically, Covid affected me so severely that it made me want to take a nap in the middle of the day.  My roommate got sick and her boyfriend who gave it to her and his mother all got sick and they all got better.  They all had very lasting coughs too.  But the thing is, none of them are afraid either because they made it through.  They recovered and it's time to return to life.  </p>
<p>I'm not going to wear a mask because I don't need to.  I don't.  I don't like being lied to and I don't like lying.  I'm not going to let someone lie to me and tell me I HAVE to be afraid of a virus that made me want to take a nap.  I'm not going to lie to others and pretend to not have gone through it.</p>
<p>Life is risky.  It always has been.  People get sick and people die.  More people have died due to lockdowns than have died from Covid-19.  We're killing people just to save a few lives.  And now we're killing people just to continue the fear.  Every single day we risk more people dying or committing suicide just so people can continue to feel safe about a virus that's come and gone.  That's not right.  So we go without masks to show that we are done with the lockdowns.  We're done with people dying because they're not allowed to get the help they need.</p>

        <p>There's no proof masks work in the general public to prevent the spread of disease. The rct done in Denmark recently showed no statistical difference between people who used them and people who didn't.</p>
<p>Real world data shows even places like CA, NY, etc, with harsh mask laws still have tons of cases, while places like FL that don't have the same or fewer cases and deaths.</p>

        <p>Even if masks work, there's no scientific reason for healthy people to wear masks.  There's no scientific reason for a person who's recovered from covid to wear a mask. There's no reason for a person who's had the vaccine to wear a mask.</p>
<p>Since the mandates indicate that these people should still wear masks, it's not about controlling a virus, it's about controlling people.</p>

        <p>I think more of us are anti-lockdown rather than anti-mask. </p>
<p>Anti-lockdown because - when is enough, enough? Do we keep locking down every country until the covid "spike" has begun to fall? And restart with each spike? With some countries or states not having as strict lockdown measures compared to their counter parts yet having the same outcome creates a baffling question of "Why?" Is it worth killing the mental well being of far more people than those that will inevitably die from covid and their co-morbidities? Simply put - UK has had roughly 400 people die from covid alone (according to parliament members) and the others have an average of 2.7 additional co-morbidities. </p>
<p>As far as Anti-Mask, you'll find people on this sub that are anti-mask and that is totally okay for anyone to hold that opinion. I'm not anti-mask but I'm not pro-mask either. As a healthcare worker, I choose to wear one in case there were that chance of me being an asymptomatic carrier and giving it to one of my older patients (even though research out of San Diego shows there's an almost 0% chance of asymptomatic spreaders). Giving a person the choice is what needs to be made - theres never an instance that a government knows what is best for its people - of course, imo</p>

        <p>Masks are the easiest thing to mock because they clearly do nothing at all. It also is the funniest thing to mock bc there’s so many people that get crazy about it. </p>
<p>But in general I don’t trust the government or the political theatre of the whole thing. Their refusal to investigate the origin of it (Chinese lab testing viruses to gain an advantage of how they work) is the final straw.</p>

        <p>I'm not 'anti mask' in that I believe people who wear masks are stupid, and I don't believe masks are somehow dangerous. I just disagree with them being government mandated, and I also struggle with all the abuse that I receive as someone who can't wear a mask for medical reasons.</p>

        <p>To my mind, the masks are a more emblematic than anything else. Wearing one in crowded places wouldn't be a big deal, if there were solid evidence they were effective, if the government were remotely consistent or believable in its messaging about them, if that were the only thing... if alot of things that unfortunately aren't true.</p>
<p>The business shutdowns are the most devastating, people being harassed for traveling or socializing is the most terrifying, but the masks are the most visible.</p>

        <p>For asymptomatic spread: Jama (JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association is a peer-reviewed medical journal published 48 times a year by the American Medical Association. - so, a very reputable source) published a study on December 14, 2020 in which is a meta-analysis of 54 studies with 77, 758 participants. The study determined that even if you are living in a house with someone who is covid positive but asymptomatic (e.g. a spouse you are sharing a bed with) <strong>"the asymptomatic/presymptomatic secondary attack rate is not statistically different from zero, and the confidence interval is technically 0.7 ± 4.2, resulting in a range of -3.5%-4.9%, but attack rates cannot be negative, so it is truncated at 0.</strong> So they can’t say below 0 as your chances in a study but your chances of contracting it are effectively zero in this scenario. This is someone you live with and share a bed with. </p>
<p>So if it's zero chances you're going to get it from someone you live withh... what do you think the odds are for walking by an asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic person at a grocery store or OUTSIDE are? </p>
<p><strong>Source study:</strong> https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774102</p>
<p>The best science prior to mid 2020 indicated that cloth and surgical masks had little effect in reducing transmission because they are not effective enough and people don’t use them properly anyways. Then all of a sudden, mask lobbyists (like Masks4All) demanded the mandates be put in place so politicians yielded. It had nothing to do with science and everything to do with lobbying. </p>
<p>The WHO admitted to the BBC that its June 2020 mask policy update was due not to new evidence but “political lobbying”: <strong>“We had been told by various sources WHO committee reviewing the evidence had not backed masks but they recommended them due to political lobbying. This point was put to WHO who did not deny.” </strong> (D. Cohen, BBC Medical Corresponent). Source for quote:

<p>Studies on the effectiveness of face masks: So far, most studies found little to no evidence for the effectiveness of cloth face masks in the general population, neither as personal protective equipment nor as a source control.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A May 2020 meta-study on pandemic influenza published by the US CDC found that face masks had no effect, neither as personal protective equipment nor as a source control: https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Danish randomized controlled trial with 6000 participants, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in November 2020, found no statistically significant effect of high-quality medical face masks against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community setting. https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A July 2020 review by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine found that there is no evidence for the effectiveness of cloth masks against virus infection or transmission. https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A May 2020 cross-country study by the University of East Anglia (preprint) found that a mask requirement was of no benefit and could even increase the risk of infection. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.20088260v1.full.pdf</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An April 2020 review by two US professors in respiratory and infectious disease from the University of Illinois concluded that face masks have no effect in everyday life, neither as self-protection nor to protect third parties (so-called source control). https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An article in the New England Journal of Medicine from May 2020 came to the conclusion that cloth face masks offer little to no protection in everyday life. https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An April 2020 Cochrane review (preprint) found that face masks didn’t reduce influenza-like illness (ILI) cases, neither in the general population nor in health care workers. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047217v2  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An April 2020 review by the Norwich School of Medicine (preprint) found that “the evidence is not sufficiently strong to support widespread use of facemasks”, but supports the use of masks by “particularly vulnerable individuals when in transient higher risk situations.” https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049528v1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A 2015 study in the British Medical Journal BMJ Open found that cloth masks were penetrated by 97% of particles and may increase infection risk by retaining moisture or repeated use. https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An August 2020 review by a German professor in virology, epidemiology and hygiene found that there is no evidence for the effectiveness of cloth face masks and that the improper daily use of masks by the public may in fact lead to an increase in infections. https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/a-1174-6591 </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some recent studies argued that cloth face masks are indeed effective against the new coronavirus and could at least prevent the infection of other people. However, most of these studies suffer from poor methodology and sometimes show the opposite of what they claim. Typically, these studies ignore the effect of other measures, the natural development of infection numbers, changes in test activity, or they compare countries with very different conditions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A meta-study in the journal Lancet, commissioned by the WHO, claimed that masks “could” lead to a reduction in the risk of infection, but the studies considered mainly N95 respirators in a hospital setting, not cloth masks in a community setting, the strength of the evidence was reported as “low”, and experts found numerous flaws in the study. Professor Peter Jueni, epidemiologist at the University of Toronto, called the WHO study “essentially useless”. https://swprs.org/who-mask-study-seriously-flawed/</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A study in the journal PNAS claimed that masks had led to a decrease in infections in three global hotspots (including New York City), but the study did not take into account the natural decrease in infections and other simultaneous measures. The study was so flawed that over 40 scientists recommended that the study be withdrawn. https://reason.com/2020/06/22/prominent-researchers-say-a-widely-cited-study-on-wearing-masks-is-badly-flawed/</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A US study claimed that US counties with mask mandates had lower Covid infection and hospitalization rates, but the authors had to withdraw their study as infections and hospitalizations increased in many of these counties shortly after the study was published. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Wearing masks for a prolonged period of time is not harmless, as the following evidence shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The WHO warns of various “side effects” such as difficulty breathing and skin rashes. https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tests conducted by the University Hospital of Leipzig in Germany have shown that face masks significantly reduce the resilience and performance of healthy adults. https://science.orf.at/stories/3201213/</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A German psychological study with about 1000 participants found “severe psychosocial consequences” due to the introduction of mandatory face masks in Germany. https://corona-transition.org/der-maskenzwang-ist-verantwortlich-fur-schwere-psychische-schaden-und-die</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Hamburg Environmental Institute warned of the inhalation of chlorine compounds in polyester masks as well as problems in connection with face mask disposal.https://corona-transition.org/maskentragen-noch-ungesunder-als-gedacht</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The European rapid alert system RAPEX has already recalled 70 mask models because they did not meet EU quality standards and could lead to “serious risks”. https://corona-transition.org/maskentragen-noch-ungesunder-als-gedacht</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Germany, two 13-year-old children died suddenly while wearing a mask for a prolonged period of time; autopsies couldn’t exclude CO2 intoxication or a sudden cardiac arrest.  https://corona-transition.org/13-jahrige-maskentragerin-stirbt  https://corona-transition.org/zweites-kind-moglicherweise-durch-maskentragen-gestorben  https://www.thoughtco.com/carbon-dioxide-poisoning-608396</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In China, several children who had to wear a mask during sports classes fainted and died; the autopsies found a sudden cardiac arrest as the probable cause of death. https://www.thatsmags.com/china/post/31100/student-deaths-lead-schools-to-adjust-rules-on-masks-while-exercising</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the US, a car driver wearing an N95 (FFP2) mask fainted and crashed into a pole.https://nypost.com/2020/04/24/driver-crashes-car-after-passing-out-from-wearing-n95-mask/</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no country in the world that has mandated mask usage that has been shown to reduce spread as covid still spreads and is increasing globally despite mandatory indoor/outdoors mask mandates and high compliance levels, including now Japan: https://rationalground.com/post-thanksgiving-mask-charts-still-no-evidence-that-masks-work/ </p>
<p>Peru who has had mandatory indoor/outdoor mask mandates since March AND strict military enforced lockdowns is 10th in the world for highest deaths per million and has a higher death per million rate than the US who many have criticized for their lax approach: https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/</p>
<p><strong>An analysis by the US CDC found that 85% of people infected with the new coronavirus reported wearing a mask “always” (70.6%) or “often” (14.4%). Compared to the control group of uninfected people, always wearing a mask did not reduce the risk of infection.</strong> https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/pdfs/mm6936a5-H.pdf#page=4</p>
<p>Conclusion: At best: they’re pointless; at worst: they’re harmful</p>

        <p>We aren't against doing something to protect people against the virus. We're against the government thinking they can force people into a false sense of protecting by restricting small business and the travel and entertainment industry.</p>
<p>You're scared of corona, well we should do as much as we can to fairly keep you safe if you want to. Include delivering supplies and giving you paid leave.</p>
<p>In my country we're in an lockdown almost as big as that one in March but this is way worse because we're still forced to travel for work.</p>
<p>There is a huge scandal going on because the schools are closed but special kids with ADHD are still forced out even if they parents are at high risk. And if they keep their kids home they will lose government help.</p>
<p>So a business owner of a barbershop that can choose to protect himself if he feels unsafe is forced to close even through he is at no risk. Meanwhile old people with Diabetes are forced to work as cashiers.</p>
<p>Were is the meaning in this?</p>
<p>We should have just given everyone at risk the optional choice to get paid leave until they're given a vaccine.</p>
<p>And these not at risk should get unpaid leave and a ability to pause rent until they have gotten a vaccine.</p>
<p>Under these payments these people should be forced to stay home unless they opt out.</p>
<p>Then everything else should just have been as before. and these not staying at home should be free to party and have fun as they did before.</p>

        <p>The way to beat a virus is the encourage people to build their immune system... you build it by going outside and getting vitamin D, going to the gym, eating healthier, etc. </p>
<p>If the govnt wanted to really help people they’d be bailing out gyms and subsidizing them so everyone could have free membership. They’d be building even more parks and running paths. They’d be subsiding organic farmers. Instead they tell everyone to sit at home, watch tv, live in fear and order take out food.</p>

        <p>Personally, I am against these mandates. If they had left it at "You SHOULD wear a mask", I wouldn't have a problem. There's lots of things in this world I should do. But when you start saying, "You MUST wear a mask", now we've got a big fucking problem. </p>
<p>At this point I won't wear mask out of sheer spite. If it could be proven tomorrow that masks cure cancer and make my dick bigger, I would piss on one before I ever wore it.</p>
<p>Tl;dr Mandates bad, liberty good.</p>

        <p>I will tell you why.</p>
<p>For centuries and I mean centuries the media and the Establishment has cried wolf.</p>
<p>Thorton Affair leading to the Mexican American war a lie</p>
<p>Sandy creek a lie used to kill Natives</p>
<p>The sinking of the Maine a lie</p>
<p>War on Terror Red Scare you name it all lies for war and control</p>
<p>People stopped trusting the media and the Establishment cause everytime we came running it wasn't a wolf.</p>
<p>Now the wolf is here and they don't trust the liars at the top.</p>
<p>If the Media hadn't cried wolf so many times they would trust them.</p>
<p>Also look at the vaccine backfire of 1976. Not a fun time. I am hoping this time is different the numbers out of Israel scare me though. 13 bells palsey? No thanks.</p>
<p>Still if they prove those 13 are just background noise and the florida and mexican doctors didn't die from the Vaccine I will take it</p>
<p>Covid is very real</p>
<p>Didn't help Fauci lied about masks but the masks thing is silly. They work</p>

        <p>Simply put, I refuse to obey unconstitutional orders.</p>
<p>In my state there is no law requiring masks, just a governor on a power trip. </p>
<p>I complied in the beginning, but then the illegal orders just kept getting piled on, and I said enough is enough, and am now flat out refusing every single illegal order, regardless of its merit.</p>

        <p>Thank you for thinking for yourself. I know that might sound a little sarcastic but I’m being serious. So many people nowadays unfortunately don’t. This makes me feel a little better about all this. Someone who doesn’t have the same viewpoint questioning us instead of attacking. Too bad more people aren’t like you.</p>

        <p>I know others have said it in their posts but I want to let you know we appreciate you coming by to hear our side without the usual pattern we see from pro mask folks--invading other topics, throwing insults and treating everyone like plague ridden grandma killers.</p>
<p>The very fact that you don't believe in forcing your views means you are the exact opposite of the people we gathered here to resist. For the most part, we don't care if you wear a mask or stay home. Some of us don't have the sort of job or finances that would allow that, nor do we see it as strictly necessary. I work in a business that provides in home installation, and we haven't once shut down or been laid off. We <em>were</em> told "you must obey these additional safety rules at all times" including masks, gloves, and sanitizer, which hasn't been rescinded these 10 months later. I didn't throw a tantrum and quit, I just complied with a minimum of effort and continued to provide for my family. Also, if they think I can <em>actually</em> do my job effectively with thin rubbery nitrile over my hands and treating every surface like a medical biohazard, they clearly have never done this before.</p>
<p>So the reason the entirety of media seems to be harping on "anti mask bad" without consideration of any other issue, is because there is a concerted effort to hide their lies under more lies. Even their fakest of numbers don't actually support the extreme measures we've been put through, so there has to be someone to blame for why we aren't able to go back to normal. That'd be us. All they have to do is call us a bunch of conspiracy nuts and conservative science hating morons, and everyone who might have stood up for us flinches back for fear of being associated with such crackpots.</p>
<p>My $.02 anyway. Have a good day :)</p>

        <p>If I may piggy back on this a bit.  For those who think it’s “just the flu”, do you think visiting or seeing patients in the hospital has value to you?  I work Covid and I agree that most deaths are in the elderly populations. But most of my patients in the hospital are in the 40-65 population. Those are the ones that are on Bipap for days to weeks. I wonder if seeing the journey, so to speak, of those that survive would help people recognize the severity of it? 
Did focusing too much on the death rate overshadow the disability rate? How do you measure a week in the hospital with no ability to talk, no TV, no windows, no visitors against say a three week no restaurants mandate.  Insight to me is very helpful.</p>

        <p>Because asymptomatic spread is extremely rare, and we've all been acting like asymptotic spreaders. Masks also create more division. Like there was enough before, now we can't even breathe properly around people we don't live with. Just makes me feel strange and depressed to be treated like a disease bag everywhere I go.</p>

        <p>This is amazing. There should be more people like you. It's OK for everyone to have their own opinion, but to be willing to understand and ask yourself the genuine question "why?" it's a rare quality these days, trying to understand others instead of attacking them downright. It is OK to have each one their own opinion. And that's what we believe in this sub. The problem is that certain people's opinion is being shoved down our throats day and night and we get attacked if we do not agree. To me, people can wear a mask as long as they like, stay at home as long as they like and get 15 vaccines in a row. The problem is when they try to impose their idea of "health" (which by the way, I think that isolation, fear, mass hysteria, hate for your neighbour is the exact opposite of health). That's what we do not like. We are all responsible human beings in this sub and no one has ever ever gotten sick because of us. We are responsible for our own health and we would like to keep this.</p>
