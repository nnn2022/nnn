        <p>Checkmate disease" is what this should be named because, like chess, it puts the hospitals into an impossible, no win situation whereby two opposite and deadly conditions manifest at the same time in the body...Zero platelets and blood clotting...Treat one and the other will kill you....This is genocide masquerading as incompetence! Murderous eugenic intent posing as medical malpractice at best...It isn't a mistake. It's a murderous agenda milking the confusion and chaos for as long as possible to inflict as much irreversible damage as it can get away with before it is confronted with the truth...How many of us will be left to fight the final battle remains to be seen as millions continue to step into this death trap called "Public health"...In a final act of the vilest manipulation; before they too succumb, their last actions are to call others to join them....</p>
<p>Jacques Attali was an advisor to François Mitterrand (former President of France) and wrote this in 1981: “In the future it will be a question of finding a way to reduce the population. We will start with the old man, because once he is over 60-65 years old, man lives longer than he produces and it costs society dearly. Then the weak and then the useless who do not contribute anything to society because there will be more and more, and especially finally the stupid. Euthanasia directed at these groups; euthanasia must be an essential instrument of our future societies, in all cases. Of course, we will not be able to execute people or organize camps. We will get rid of them by making them believe that it is for their own good</p>
