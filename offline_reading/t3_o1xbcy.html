        <p>Could also be money. </p>
<p>Person a is scared of the coof to the point he will inject experimental chemicals into his body.</p>
<p>Now, they could settle for that one payout, or they could go "Oh no, now you need to be afraid of <em>five</em> coofs, and get yearly updates on <em>all</em> of them!"</p>
<p>In the long run, I suspect they will have the best profit, and lowest risk of riding a 3-legged mare, if they lift the lockdowns and keep pushingnthe Vax to the gullible.</p>

        <p>Yeah they’re all NSAIDs which would actually fail FDA approval today. </p>
<p>I’m sure we’ve all had to use steroid cream. </p>
<p>There’s a reason many of these things require prescription. It’s not addiction, rather the affects of taking them.</p>
<p>If you are concerned about “injecting chemicals into your body” you should question why that method is FDA approved and the one you choose to consume only has it as it’s historic treatment. Ie: pick one.</p>

        <p>And that's the problem you face when you come to a sub full of people who are smarter than you and try to start drama. Your standard go-to of making a false equivalence, and when caught, acting exceptionally stupid so that you can pretend victory by going "a-ha! I'm actually from &lt;different brigade sub&rt; don't you feel silly!" is easy to see through and nobody cares enough to engage. And yet you have so much of your ego tied up in the attempt that you can't help but to desperately keep trying in hopes of getting the last word. </p>
<p>Just once, I'd like to see one of you NPCs go off-script and try something original.</p>

        <p>So many people in the skeptical covid circles have been saying that vaccines iin the heat of a pandemic will just create crazier variants that hurt everyone. They keep pushing the narrative “vaccine immunity &rt; natural immunity”. This has NEVER been the case with ANY other disease. It doesn’t even make sense! Why do you think injecting mRNA will be more effective than a virus injecting its mRNA ? They’re really still drawing out this narrative even tho everyone is fucking over it (I’m speaking for everyone lol). Those countries that are “waiting” don’t want the fucking vaccine cuz they know what happens when they get injected with anything the WHO is pushing. It’s so infantilizing, too… “waiting” passively for your fucking vaccine. They’ve seen way worse than this virus! Give me a break!</p>

        <p>None of those vaccines are 100%. The immunity conferred through natural infection can give you 100% immunity (for example, chicken pox--you get it once as a kid and then never again. Same with measles, and you can confer immunity to newborns through breast milk). Same with polio etc. The issue is that some people do not survive these diseases or have lifelong damage from these diseases. That does not mean that vaccine immunity is 'superior'. It depends on how risky the disease is. There is a lot of factors to understanding the risks and benefits of vaxing which is unpopular to talk about cuz you basically get shut down as anti-science etc.  Here is an example of a system/society-wide effect of getting immunity from vaccines described here: </p>
<p>“before the introduction of modern sanitation, polio infection was acquired during infancy, at which time it seldom caused paralysis but provided lifelong immunity against polio infection and paralysis later in life” (p. 1075) [2]. These observations were especially important in the tropics, as Spalding emphasized in discussing poliomyelitis: “the disease is endemic and the virus is ubiquitous. Children who are exposed to it at a very early age rarely suffer permanent damage and acquire immunity” (p. 800) [3]<br>
Since the introduction of the WHO vaccination campaign, the situation has changed. If there is reinfection in a country where the wild virus has been removed, the first contact is no longer during infancy but later, during childhood or adolescence. Then these children or adolescents, not being fully protected by vaccination, are likely to become paralyzed. This is the probable explanation for the outbreak in Namibia, where children ⩽12 years old developed poliomyelitis, including 3 who had bulbar palsy [4, 5]. It has been confirmed that the source of this outbreak was Angola [6]. A more-severe epidemic occurred in Angola, where there were 1093 cases, including 89 deaths [7]" <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/194/11/1619/916374">https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/194/11/1619/916374</a> </p>
<p>Polio and Hep A are spread by fecal matter. The risk of ingesting fecal matter in a significant amount in the developed world is pretty much nil. </p>
<p>In the case of COVID, the threat of being ravaged or death is not that high for low-risk people, especially young people and children. So if COVID follows the same trend as all other diseases (which, why wouldn't it), natural immunity gives superior results to vaccines, which are never 100% effective and can sometimes be harmful.</p>

        <p>The point of vaccines is to prevent you from dying but also to stop the spread of the disease and hopefully eradicate it. Measles was nearly completely eradicated but has been cropping up more and more due to anti-vaxxers.</p>
<p>And if you read further in the journal you linked, you'll see that they are advocating for a different timeline of vaccination, not stopping vaccination altogether.</p>
<p>"it would have been more rational to introduce vaccination gradually and only when the infant mortality rate had decreased substantially."</p>
<p>Also, they were able to give infants polio, if we were to have given infants COVID at the beginning of 2020, that would not stop the elderly from getting sick like in the example of polio. The difference is an existing disease where they could predict an outcome and a new disease where we had little to no information about how it spread, presented, or pretty much anything about it for the first few months. We are still learning more about COVID and the fact that there have been infants *have* died from COVID, it is perfectly reasonable for parents to want to get the vaccine so they have a lower risk of getting it to lower the risk of transferring it to their baby.</p>

        <p>I mean if you want my thesis statement it would be "Natural immunity <em>is</em> more effective when the disease has existed for a long time and we know how the disease works. However, when there is a new disease where we have limited knowledge of the disease, relying on herd immunity would not benefit those who were not able to achieve natural immunity at the infant stage and thus not benefit most of the population; notably those who are immunocompromised and elderly people. Therefore, vaccines are more effective and logical in regards to COVID 19."</p>

        <p>Well, we don’t know much about the vaccine either. There are people who have seriously been affected by the vaccine as well, and deaths within a short time period after. So it’s not exactly this completely unproblematic easy way out of the situation, either. Every medical intervention has a cost benefit analysis.</p>

        <p>Of course, there is no perfect solution. However, deaths from the vaccine are significantly lower than deaths from COVID. Also, although long-term effects of the vaccine are yet to be seen (possibly because there are none), we have evidence that long-term effects post-recovery can include fatigue, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, coughing, and sleep difficulties.</p>

        <p>Even w all that info, tho, my upset was that they’re claiming vaccine immunity is superior to natural immunity when historically that is false. You just agreed that historically that is the case. Whether you think the covid situation merits the vax or not is unrelated to the fact that I think they’re manipulating people by claiming the vax immunity is superior when there isn’t really enough research on either immunity to make a judgment call (but common sense and experience would point to natural immunity logically being superior)</p>

        <p>I was also responding to your post that only included one study and one virus. If we look at smallpox, 80% of infected children would die. I can't find statistics for infants with smallpox but it seems unlikely that you could get "natural immunity" from it as there's a higher chance of you dying</p>

        <p>Yeah, when I showed my friends the interview with Geert Vanden Bosche, they sent me an article that claimed he was trying to push his own vaccine and so that’s why he’s speaking out against these ones… when he literally never said anything about having a vaccine. He said he was working on developing ways of activating Natural Killer cells in the body as immune response to viruses. Didn’t say anything about having a vaccine ready to be released or anything. They also said he was a veterinarian… I didn’t hear him say anything about being a vetenarian..? They just discredit him and discarded anything he had to say . Even if he’s “just “ an immunologist, he’s allowed to bring up concerns…! It’s total madness</p>

        <p>Your friends are too far gone. The msm has their brains in shackles. If the first thing you do is try to discredit someone instead of having a conversation about the topic it’s because you can’t prove that you’re right. Never watched game of thrones and it’s a bit of an over exaggerated comparison but “When you tear out a man's tongue, you are not proving him a liar, you're only telling the world that you fear what he might say.”</p>
