        <p>Saying that 68% are vaccinated is one of the biggest lies of this whole thing.</p>

        <p>&rt;considering a plan to 'manage' the US with just 68% of Americans with shots.</p>
<p>This is a good idea. Door to door forced inoculations will be the end of "Democratic socialism" in America.  They couldn't win an election for a decade after that.</p>
<p>The lowest rates of vaccination in America is the African American community.  The DNC can't win an election without 80%+ of the black vote.</p>

        <p>Perhaps stop wasting tax payer dollars and shift your focus to being humanitarian by looking for better ways of treating COViD patients, rather than forcing s vaccine that people clearly don't want.</p>
<p>Covid isn't going away. It's here thanks to Dr Fauci. We need to accept that and move on. Those that want the vaccine will get it. There needs to be other options.</p>

        <p>How about letting covid do it's thing among the unvaccinated and whoever is left now has immunity? That's an idea the doomers and the "anti vax" crowd can both get behind, right? Hell I'll even throw in some federal subsidies for the vaccinated who don't trust their precious vaccine to stay home from work for another year while this plays out.</p>

        <p>I mean maybe if they stopped the propaganda and bribes more people would get vaccinated? I have spoken to several people who were set on getting the vaccine as soon as they were eligible but after seeing the bribes and propaganda they changed their mind. They think something dark is going on here, something isnâ€™t right.</p>

        <p>I was probably 60/40 myself leaning towards getting it earlier this year but the unrelenting propaganda and religious fanaticism about it just made me more and more suspicious.</p>

        <p>We have three impostors among us. </p>
<p>I was for sure gonna get the J&amp;J but around early March I was talking with a manager who is from Moldova and she said she and her partner (who is Russian) were both potentially saying no. I didn't see the need for me to do it.</p>
<p>Then I saw how fanatical people were getting about it and I'm like hmm, kinda sus.</p>
<p>They wouldn't need bribes if it was really that good.</p>

        <p>I really do wonder what will be next... maybe they will bring in the idea of vaccine passports and that will get shoo'd off as well. After that? Maybe they fuck off... the NWO cannot continue if people don't consent.</p>
