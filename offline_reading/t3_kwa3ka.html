    <strong>Anyone else get a runny nose from wearing masks for long periods of time? As in hours?</strong>
    <p><p>Or could it be the fact that I’m using surgical masks? I’ve seen posts on here that they have chemicals in them but I don’t really know anything about it. </p>
<p>Are cloth masks actually better, if you have to wear one? I can’t breathe properly through thick cloth masks but I know there are a lot of them designed to be more breathable.</p>
<p>Today was the first day in a while I’ve had to wear one for a longer time than going into a store. I’m not going to explain the situation but I had to. Also, I used two of them throughout the day because they’re meant to be disposable and I feel super grossed out when they get wet.</p>
<p>After I had it off it completely went away, but as soon as I put it on again (within minutes) it came back. Just a runny nose, no symptoms, it’s not covid. </p>
<p>Please don’t call me a sheep, don’t support the mandates but I need to work and fly. I’m just asking this question here because I feel like I could get attacked on other subs.</p></p>

        <p>I have to wear one at work and I kept feeling like I was getting sick. It gave me the feeling you get right before you catch a cold, but it wouldn’t get any worse and it went away in a day or 2. This has happened multiple times since masks and never happened before.</p>

        <p>Yes. Get a few comfortable fabric masks. Wash with unscented detergent, both before wearing them and between wearings. Have a few to swap out if you're wearing for a long stretch.</p>

        <p>Yup all the time and as someone else said that feeling of getting sick. Buy a faceshield if you can.</p>

        <p>Edit: I have a weird but really mild burning sensation in my nose. Maybe it was just the type of disposable masks I’ve got because today was the first time I used them for more than a few minutes. </p>
<p>It might also be because ate some food with Thai peppers a few hours ago but I really don’t think so because I eat spicy food all the time and this never happens.</p>

        <p>Humans aren't meant to be breathing through a mask for long periods of times, It could be a number of factors, do you change the mask often or do you use the same one over and over again? it could be the chemicals in the mask, it could be something you ate, do you wash your hands and dispose of the mask every time you touch it and replace it? if so it could be something in the soap that gets on the mask and you are breathing it in, the list can go on</p>
