        <p>I remember back in ISIS days one of the few biggest newspapers of our countries had a story with what was supposed to be a ISIS guy grave robbing. Later I saw I video of that same guy from when the picture was made and he was not grave robbing but showing his respects. There's lot of other instances where things like this happen but this was the first time I saw how blatant the news can lie.</p>
<p>In fact, probably the biggest news paper of my country used to be a Nazi propaganda channel back in the day. They have not changed in the sense that they're still all about propaganda too. And it's still effective!</p>

        <p>Sure COVID exists, so does the Common Cold...IT's just a name they give they give to a circulating pathogen. And from what read, people aren't really questioning the existence of COVID, perhaps it's origins, but primarily it's the "pandemic" and the ensuing measures that are being taken that are in question. Is the term pandemic being applied correctly? sure, by definition any pathogen that has spread to multiple geographical locations can be considered a pandemic..Like the common cold lol. However, the claims and implications that this pandemic is a global killer is an absolute farce and all the data reflects this. </p>
<p>Take an Annual flu bug in a year where there are already going to be a higher number of deaths, call it COVID, market it as the next Spanish Flu, scare people shitless by fabricating "models" that show how deadly COVID is, place infected people into nursing homes and hospitals to boost numbers, redefine how COD's are recorded and give financial incentives to declare COVID as a cause, kill a multitude of people through the misuse of ventilators to ensure deaths tolls reach a level that can justify there fear mongering, then proceed to cancel or close medical services, lockdown and mask people in the name of "public safety", but actually removing the most vital elements that sustain a healthy immune system like fresh air, exercise, human contact and general healthy psychological state (stress kills the immune system), therefore over an extended period of a deteriorating immune system, people will be highly susceptible to any pathogen circulating and compounded by the other conditions that will emerge and go untreated, like cancers. This sets the stage for more "upsurges" in deaths that can be leveraged. </p>
<p>So COVID doesn't need to be a HOAX for the pandemic to be a hoax.</p>
<p>The problem with why this sub is gone to shit is becasue it has become inundated with shills  who think they are clever when they twist the context of what is really being said and use the twisted version as rationalization to make arrogant snide remarks.</p>

        <p>lol..I know what you mean, it's very confusing when you try and understand how they could possibly rationalize their position and then project our position.</p>
<p>I think they need to believe. We have crossed the threshold whereby people have either fallen into a complete psychosis, and therefore their minds depend on the idea of the pandemic just for sheer survival, or their ego's would be totally shattered if they accepted the truth. The other is the control freaks, who have been craving the opportunity to impose their wills upon others, even if the origin of the "will" comes from elsewhere, it doesn't matter as long as they can freely exercise their need for control upon others. In any of these cases, what's characteristic of them all is that the pandemic appeals to each one and like a drug, they need it to sustain their state of mind. </p>
<p>I have yet to encounter anyone that can deliver a logical, well supported argument that demonstrates how the pandemic is real and the measures are justified...Once I produce real data, the argument diminishes to a barrage of derogatory remarks and / or goes silent lol...</p>

        <p>Thats a really good explanation of it, in part i also really think the media brainwashing (and CENSORING) they target at all age groups both online (10-55+) and MSM (18-80+) have been extremely effective, they blindly belive everything they are told and have been pre-programmed to see us as raging lunatics who belive the earth is flat and Trump is the second coming of Jesus and this even applies to liberal leaning Europeans, Asians etc somehow, its absolutely ridicilous. And also labeling conspiracy theoriest as a bad word even though we absolutely should be vigilant about the goverment and the people in prominent positions and that there is nothing “insane” about it.</p>
<p>Yep, same here, its always “SEETHE” “Trump lost!!” “GRANNY KILLER” “i hope you die of covid/respirator etc” and my favorite “source?” and when you do provide it its silence or just more vitriol. Its just absolutely mad.</p>
<p>I just want to add to the media part also, i live in Denmark and they tried to make a vaccine mandate and there were huge protests for 9+ days untill they relented, NO DANISH MEDIA COVERED IT.</p>

<p>Thats the logical scenario that people are trying to prevent. All this theater is to make sure that if you get to the hospital, for any reason, that you have a bed. Even if its „just“ corona and you prob wont die. </p>

        <p>Just some food for thought: The big difference between the common flu and corona is that the flu doesnt appear globally at the same time. Its spread out, therefore the cases can be handled, health system is fine.</p>
<p>Corona, while not that deadly, spread out simultaneously all over the globe. Dont remember italy when they didnt have enough beds? Thats the whole issue with corona. It was never about the death rate, but about the collapse of our hospitals.</p>
<p>If it was seasonal like the flu it wouldnt be an issue.</p>

        <p>RIGHT!!! lol</p>
<p>And when you plug those numbers in, which I have calculated, the entire world has already been exposed /  infected long long ago.</p>
<p>Just for the record the health system has always been fine...Do you remember all those COVID emergency overflow and testing centers that they spent 100's of millions on that never got used...The Hospitals have been operating well below capacity especially relative to former years, ICU units have always operated at, near or above capacity long before COVID..They have laid off, let go reduced hours for countless medical staff...Just like the videos you have seen showing the hospitals empty, which I can attest is the same for my local hospital which operated almost at 100% capacity all the time, is nearly vacant. </p>
<p>Initially they created a surge in hospitals becasue they scared the shit out of people...This was deliberate to create the illusion of the pandemic. </p>
<p>I predicted back in March that they were trying to mimic the Spanish Flu based on the media hype and therefore we would see a lull and then they would come out with a ore deadly strain to recreate the fear...Oh and just for the record, they really have no clue about the Spanish flu 90% of the material is purely speculation including the death tolls. Also, note thhat viruses do not behave in the manner we are seeing or the human race would have been eradicated long ago. They operate under two basic premises. High infectious rate, Low virility or Low infection rate, High virility. With COVID, they literally started with a low high, then went to a high high, and back to a high low and now have been trying to create another high high scenario lol...It's completely absurd.</p>

        <p>In the italianregion that got hit first no one knew what was coming. Thats the reality how it turns out if you do nothing. </p>
<p>Saying they created a surge is a joke, considering that the media and people only catched onto corona when italy got hit. Before it was just some weird virus in china, few cared about except for a headline.
The death rate in the italian region has picked up before it hit the media and before we knew corona was alrdy in italy. Without media or anything, that would have been suspicious already. After all there were italian doctors raising awareness to the rise of similar cases, before it got to the media.</p>
<p>The nature of preventative actions is that u can also do too much. Or that the actions are so effective, that it seems there was never a danger.</p>

        <p>lol so they didn't create surge...Well perhaps it's time for you to do some homework.</p>
<ul>
<li>First based on the alleged infection rates the entirety of Eastern Asia would have a graveyard well before Italy or any other country got hit, and well before any measures were taken period.</li>
<li>Now they are trying to backdate COVID to sept 2019 in Italy.</li>
<li>But then it took 5 months of circulating before it killed it's first victim...lol</li>
<li>From Feb 19, suddenly the whole world is under siege</li>
<li>With another 5 months there are surges across the globe lol</li>
</ul>
<p>As for fabricating the surge
 - They didn't place infected people into the most vulnerable care facilities ?
 - They didn't change policies to declare almost any symptom as COVID COD?
 - They didn't provide financial incentives to medical facilities to declare COVID as COD's
 - They didn't kill countless people through the misuse of ventilators</p>
<p>Ok, lmao, there is no statistical reality to what we have witnessed and the only joke is believing this pandemic has any organic merit whatsoever.</p>

        <p>lol a virus spreads depending on where the infected go, not depending on which country borders yours.</p>
<p>But lets see if there is even a point in arguing with you: Before corona was an official thing in italy, the region that got hit hardest already had a suspiciously higher death rate and more people in hospitals.</p>
<p>So it didnt take 5 months for it to kill someone. Thats how long it took to sprrad so far that it became obvious that a virus is going on.</p>
<p>Please go look at death rates as well as hospital occupance in the lombardy region before corona hit the media. Its really obvious.</p>
<p>Your indications of a surge are laughable. That all would only lead to a surge if hospitals would declare untested people as corona deaths. But thats not whats happening. Im sure there are countries where that happens, but for example in western europe that would be close to impossible. Atleast if you do it routinely as you say to create a surge. Sooner or later that would be uncovered durung a routine check.</p>

        <p>lol.</p>
<p>You're too funny...I can't believe the lengths you will go to rationalize this delusion of a pandemic.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Italy historical Death mortality rates:
https://www.statista.com/statistics/568024/death-rate-in-italy/</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Italy projected mortality rates:
https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/ITA/italy/death-rate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Italy 2020 Current mortality rate:
Projected at 700,000 which equals a 1.15% mortality rate compares to 1.08 projected and 1.05 for 2019...Considering when you factor int he projected for future years, they are not that far off the mark..</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the spread, have you even bothered to look at the timelines?
20 countries infected by January, that's one hell of an infectious virus.
So you think only infected people travel?
Based on the stats reported in the US, from the first death recorded Feb 5 to the 25,000 death recorded April 19th, when you extrapolate the data using a 2% death rate, the entire country would have been infected and over 6 million dead within the next 6 weeks. If you lower the death rate then the infection rate increases and therefore it would have taken even less time to spread across the country..</p>
<p>Over 94% of people who allegedly died with COVID had other serious comorbidities. And YES hospitals were declaring many people as COVID deaths without testing as per the "guidance" </p>
<p>"In cases where a definite diagnosis of COVID–19 cannot
be made, but it is suspected or likely (e.g., the circumstances
are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty), it
is acceptable to report COVID–19 on a death certificate as
“probable” or “presumed.” In these instances, certifiers should
use their best clinical judgement in determining if a COVID–19
infection was likely. However, please note that testing for
COVID–19 should be conducted whenever possible"</p>
<p>BTW your saying the surge is laughable:</p>
<p>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-05-italy-deaths-rose.html</p>
<p>2020 was already going to be a year where many westernized countries were going to experience a higher mortality rate and this trend is also expected to persist. without COVID lol...</p>
<p>Listen man, your spouting nonsense trying to sound like you have some basis, but you don't, the numbers and stats speak loud and clear, which it's very apparent you cannot comprehend or choose to remain in denial to support your beliefs.</p>
<p>People who live in this full blown psychosis avoid the numbers becasue they are so telling and their minds are so invested into the pandemic that if they allowed themselves to accept the facts, their realities would shatter, so i get it lol..</p>

        <p>And why would almost every country on earth willingly destroy their economy to do that? Why does every country have the exact same problem. Either its a huge scheme where every single scientist around the globe that has told us to stay at home and social distance ourself is in on with no clear benefit to noone.

<p>The world was lead to believe that there was a lethal pandemic, an invisible enemy that was going to wipe out humanity. Of course every nation is going to panic, especially when these the information is being disseminated by "trusted" sources.</p>
<p>Simple fear tactics:</p>
<p>- A video showing people dropping dead in the street in Wuhan'- Theater and never seen again until India, another staged event</p>
<p>- Claims that the WHO suppressed the information</p>
<p>- Mass erection of COVID facilities to handle the imminent hospital overflows - never used and hospitals were well under capacity not over</p>
<p>- Claims of anomalistic side effects like COVID foot and COVID rash which didn't last long in the media </p>
<p>- Silencing of medical personnel under threat of discharge who come forward and claim how bad the situation really is - This one was a great move - caused instant panic in people  </p>
<p>- Claims of Ventilator shortages that were going to result in mass deaths, yet it was the ventilators that caused most of those deaths and that campaign went real quiet.</p>
<p>- Deliberating infecting nursing homes with a pathogen (most likely pneumonia) and killing immunocompromised people and people who were already about to die to boost the numbers</p>
<p>- Censoring of social media / internet and labelling anyone who raises questions based on the real data</p>
<p>- Manipulating the data to create the illusion</p>
<p>- Changing policies to ensure that just about any death could be labelled COVID</p>
<p>- Never truly isolating the the entire virus, only a fragment, and basing all testing and diagnosing on this fragment which literally could be anything.</p>
<p>- Using a PCR test that could create a positive in any tissue sample </p>
<p>- Look at the faces representing the Pandemic, Gates and Fauci - these are trusted sources for sure lol</p>
<p>- Look at the wealth transfer during the Pandemic - The billionaires got richer so the only ones that suffered are the people and who is running the pandemic, the billionaires lol</p>
<p>- Plenty of scientists and medical doctors have come forward but never make mainstream becasue they oppose the narrative therefore are discredited despite their accreditations. </p>
<p>This whole scheme only took a handful of people and some really well executed scare tactics. You think the average doctor has any clue?, no they are given a set of instructions and follow those instructions. Simple. As for scientists, most are funded by these billionaires, therefore they will produce the results that gets them paid.  But the bottom line is, the jig is up and people are finally catching on. All the contradictions, the hypocrisy, the outright bullshit is surfacing. Nobody can answer the questions as to why the "anti-masker and anti vaxxer" communities are thriving with respect to health, and it's raising eyebrows <a href="https://everywhere.You">everywhere. You</a> can only suppress the truth for so long. </p>
<p>lmao...too much</p>

        <p>Do you really think every nation can work togheter like that when they cant even agree on the most simple shit. That china, the US and european scientists all agree that covid is to be taken seriously even though they apparently all know its bs? Every single one of these did their own research but they are all in on it. Do you see how unlikely that is. Some of the points you made might be true even though theres no way to guarantee it since you provided no sources but dont you see that it all boils down to how highly unlikely, one could say impossible, this conspiracy is?</p>

        <p>lol Which source, there's a countless number of them, in fact all you have to do is open your eyes and you can't miss them.</p>
<p>The only bullshit is the ones trying to be passed off as a pandemic. </p>
<p>Why is the anti mask, anti pandemic, anti vaccine communities and people  doing just fine and not dropping dead in the streets...Why? answer that fucking question..Every place that has rejected this pandemic is alive and well.</p>
<p>As for your incessant and absurd assertion that somehow sooooo many people need to be involved to make this conspiracy a reality is just a fallacy wen in fact it's only a very small group that control the entire world.</p>
<p>When people look to a man like Bill Gates as there savior, a man who's only background in medicine is his hundreds of millions invested in the industry, an industry that thrives on sick people and a man who is a proponent of eugenics and depopulation, it is the people who look to this person who have gone mad, completely dismissing any reason or any real science. And if it is this easy to make a man like this a Global icon in the minds of a pandemic, then pulling it off is far more simple than you seem to comprehend.</p>
<p>When people to to a man like Fauci, as another savior who will guide us to safety, yet hasn't been able to get his story straight from the beginning, and who also has a financial stake in the pandemic, again a another demonstration of how easily people will so easily abandon reason.</p>
<p>If you are confused as to the references I provided, it only serves to prove that you have absolutely no grasp on reality and therefore just a waste of time.</p>

        <p>This exact scenario is playing out on reddit currently. That dude who cosplayed the fat world of War craft gamer "died of corona " and everyone on the thread is talking about assholes spreading corona and how his death hit them hard. 1) what fucking joke life do you live if a guy who you saw a picture of once "hit you hard" and 2) dudes been morbidly obese for decades. He didn't give a shit about his health his entire life, why should I care about it after he died because of his neglect?</p>

        <p>If you're an expert in any field and read a story on the news its hilarious how wrong they get it but then we assume they get everything else right when its a subject we are unfamiliar with. Theres a term for it but I can't recall it at the moment</p>

        <p>Jeremy Clarkson is only 60. 60 is not that high risk so it doesn't surprise me that he is fine.</p>
<p>The porportion of 60 year olds who had a history of heart attacks or stroke is probably significantly higher than the porportion of 60 year olds who died of COVID-19.</p>
<p>If you are an obese 60 year old, especially if you have diabetes or heart disease, it would be a good idea for you to lose weight and lower your blood sugar. But don't be surprised if you only get a bad flu even if you don't take those precautions. Your safest bet is to lose weight and lower your blood pressure if you are afraid of ending up in the ICU or cemetery from COVID. And quit smoking.</p>
<p>I'm not one to victim blame. I believe in universal health care and all that. I'm more left than most people here probably. But if you are obese or smoke cigarettes, you have zero right to force other people to lock down for your safety. Period. Either you assume the risks of your lifestyle, voluntarily shelter in place or you take steps to get healthy.</p>

        <p>Yes, there are so many people who either don't understand or don't want to take the responsibility for the bodies they live in and use every minute of every day. If you're mentally and physically capable, it's your responsibility, no one else can do it for you. Disabled people or kids is a different story, but they usually have caretakers, parents, guardians and it's THEIR responsibility....NOT the government or the whole of a country's population.</p>

        <p>OCD,left side thinking, higher IQ  people of the world are suffering from all the false media reports. It is causing paranoid personality disorders in all corners of the world. I am slowly losing the love of my life . In 27 years we have been together this year marking our 20 th anniversary of marriage in November. I have seen a complete change in my wonderfully funny, super caring, hardworking, highly intelligent husband. He has become super paranoid, seeing signs in music, numbers, the most innocent of retail ads. This has increasingly worsened in last 3 months. I have cried, begged, screamed, and finally said enough and said he either seeks help or leaves. His loving family has tried. His parents who both just turned 80 are dying from his condition. They are at at loss. I try not to involve them anymore. He doesn’t eat, sleep, or groom like he used to. He has gone from 245 lbs pure muscle down to 175 lbs of bones. He stopped leaving the house a month ago. He believes god tasked him to save the world. He can’t stop looking for answers to how to stop the madness that he perceives as truths from the media. He cries with fear that he’s not going to find the way to save humanity. If I debunk or cannot see what he sees he cries that I’ve lost my soul. I’ve called every type of treatment center and unless he wants treatment they won’t help. I finally was told by my son that I am playing with fire. It hit home. As a mom , even though I said he is my burden, for better or worse, I love this man. I told him he needs to either seek help or leave. I told him I love him, but I need to set boundaries for myself and our kids. The youngest still at home is 18 daughter and my son 22 years old cannot have anyone over. His mania scares their friends. He’s not aggressive at all . He’s just off the wall with what he perceives as happening. As soon as anyone stops by he is filling their ears with psycho babble bull. It’s embarrassing and my boy doesn’t fight him but my daughter will attack him verbally with such cruelness out of frustration that it’s hard on me. I feel she has a right and feel for her and her youthfulness taken but as well sympathetic to his feelings as I know he is mentally under duress. He gasps for air while reading. He tears up and sometimes even sobs heavily with fear,anxiety, and most of all saving billions of people. He’s even said if he needs to leave to find a way he will. I questioned his love for us and he cries that he loves us but we are desensitized due to getting flu vaccines so he can’t save us so he needs to save who he can and he doesn’t have much time. So please , please, I know you all will give me  backlash, Please be sympathetic. Empathetic intelligent people are usually the best thing that will happen in your life. They are the ones we are losing to this plague of false media and lies. I will take these past 27 years with him and live the rest of my years trying to get him back if that’s what it takes. I’m only 45 so ya know it’s going to be a journey. A journey I’m willing to take. May we all live in peace.</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry to hear this. While what is happening with the media is certainly harmful, I don't think that can really be the cause of what you're describing... that seems far deeper. People experiencing paranoid delusions can be dangerous. You may want to have him committed (or the equivalent, wherever you are) if he won't seek treatment, but I understand that would be a heartbreaking decision. Best wishes.</p>

        <p>In our state he must either commit a crime or be physically dangerous in order for me to have him committed. I’ve exhausted all options for getting him help. He has to authorize treatment or a doctor has to convince him to accept care. He really thinks he is the normal one and the rest of us are not. He as well doesn’t trust doctors. So now I wait. Hoping he doesn’t become aggressive to us or a danger to himself. We don’t rest much because neither does he. The manic episodes seem to increase later when it’s time to sleep. He averages 2-4 hrs sleep a day. Really is media fueling him. He believes it all and then basis the rest off of others blog sites. He’s always like I said had OCD . If you combine that with a lot of negativity it can become problematic. Thank you for the advice. I wish I could . Thank you as well for the blessings , we can use as many as we can get.</p>

        <p>So has anyone on here actually read the column in the Times that Clarkson himself conducted? Because he talks about how scary covid is and how he's not sure he's even better yet, but then went on twitter to directly contradict himself?</p>
<p>Just wondering because the title of this post is incredibly ironic.</p>

<p>He said when he found out he had it, he was scared he would die in a plastic bag or whatever- but that he stayed home and recovered. Read the article. These two pictures don’t contradict each other.</p>
