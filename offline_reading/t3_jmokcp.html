    <strong>People who do not mind the lockdowns have not had their social life upended.</strong>
    <p><p>Whenever there is a case spike and we are entering WAVE 2 or we're still in WAVE 1. I think people get excited. I think there is a group of people who like to play quarantine. This website is made up of almost all young people who are at such little risk to this virus yet they are acting like they are 85 year old shut ins who won't go outside.</p>
<p>I have a life, I have hobbies, I have friends stop making me feel guilty for going to my friends apartments, going on an RV trip with my friends, planning ski trips,  and trying to live my life. I don't want to generalize, but I think a lot of doomer people were the people that stay in most weekends and don't socialize to the extent of others. That is not saying it is wrong to be introverted but I think they do not understand why I am desperate to see my friends every weekend after working M-F. </p>
<p>My friends are the most important thing to me besides my family so stop trying to make me feel like a piece of shit for wanting to see them. So what if there is more than six of us hanging out at once. Fuck off.</p></p>
