    <strong>2020: the year I realised that I'm a huge conspiracy theorist and that there's nothing wrong with that</strong>
    <p><p>I never thought it would come to this but after lurking here for a while I thought I'd share how the handling of Covid around the world (mostly in the UK and US) has affected how I view the government using special powers in situations such as a pandemic.</p>
<p>Back in February when it was announced that the virus had broken into pandemic status, I willingly accepted the early measures such as social distancing and the move from going into work/study to working remotely where possible. It made sense.</p>
<p>Then came the orders for non-essential businesses to close for a few weeks and for people to remain inside except for "the essentials". Again, I complied as I believed it was possible for said businesses to recover, even though in hindsight maybe even that was a generous expectation. After all, it was for the greater good which was something I genuinely believed in at the time.</p>
<p>Then came the hypocrisy and gaslighting. </p>
<p>"Masks don't work. Oh wait they do now".</p>
<p>"Protesting or mass gathering at this time is irresponsible and will promote the spread of the virus. Now watch us do it and complain if you dare".</p>
<p>"You lost your job so that healthcare workers wouldn't be overwhelmed by the cases. Now watch them flaunt that by choreographing TikTok videos and twerking in your dumb unemployed face".</p>
<p>How quickly the people demanding these things could wrap most of the public around their little finger is very frightening.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I am by no means antivax but I believe having fears about grievious side effects from the covid-19 vaccine that has been rushed out in only one year isn't irrational in the slightest. But unfortunately, I've noticed even that viewpoint is being demonised by the media.</p>
<p>The new normal essentially boils down to people being taught never to question the actions or motives of the government ever again. And it has worked on just about everyone I know. I don't know you guys personally of course, but it's good to know there's still some people from the old world left. I hope for all our sakes we never have to face repurcussions for our determination to speak out about this. I feel as though I'm taking a big risk just posting this but honestly, at the same time I feel as though it would be wrong to remain silent.</p>
<p>I just want the nightmare to be over and every day I'm less convinced that that's just going to happen by itself. That the government will just loose their grip by their own accord. Why would they? You can tell they've realised that this is a perfect opportunity to steamroll over our lives indefinitely. This is the sort of thing that fallen monarchies would be kicking themselves for not coming up with when it was their turn. The fact that most people now don't even suspect that is just sad.</p>
<p>I don't care who I disappoint with my opinions here. If you disagree, that's one thing. But if you honestly, from the bottom of your heart  believe that speech like this should be censored or otherwise suppressed... You are an enabler for tyrants and therefore you are nothing but a stranger to me.</p>
<p>There is no "greater good". People who think they know what's best for <em>you</em> either don't know you or are full of shit.</p>
<p>Happy new year to you all. Let's brace ourselves for whatever's going to throw itself at us next.</p></p>

        <p>I've been fairly loud about how I feel. About the flip flopping and absolutely ridiculous rules. No one tries to shut me up, but they don't seem to care as much as I do. And that's disheartening. 
I watched the last episode of Electric Dreams and realized the propaganda that episode displayed to the public was meant to outcast people like YOU and ME. The people that question the sanity of what is going on. It put a target on the backs of those questioning it. And the last word of the episode was that only the insane would question the insanity of what was going on. I hate a lot of shows now because of the current state of things.</p>

        <p>I think the best thing we can do at this point is turn "conspiracy theorist" into a non-dirty term. Though we can't really claim it for ourselves we can certainly weaken its edge as a gaslighting tool by authoritarians</p>

        <p>This was well articulated. America was founded on a conspiracy. The word, conspiracy, or the phrase, conspiracy theory, has a bad connotation with it for people to use that to dismiss anyone with dissenting opinions.</p>
