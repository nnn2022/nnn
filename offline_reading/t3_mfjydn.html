    <strong>In the UK, we can't go back to the old normal, because it doesn't exist. This country is dead inside.</strong>
    <p><p>The government has created a monster that it can't now tame: a population that refuse to return to normal. I asked a question on r/AskUK the other day, about getting back to normal and whether or not people felt safe. The overwhelming majority of people said even after the rules were lifted and they'd had both vaccines that they'd never again go places without a mask, they'd leave home as little as possible, pubs &amp; clubs are no longer places they'll attend and they'll endeavour to see people virtually, where possible. This will kill our economy, I mean it's already dead on its' feet, but this will put the final nail in the service economy's coffin. People have been so effectively scared here by the government that the old normal no longer functionally exists, and trying to go back to it is a pipe dream.</p></p>

        <p>Agreed.</p>
<p>While most of the folks I know here are pro-lockdown (sigh) they're all rearing to get back to normal ASAP as far as I can tell. If there are real people too afraid to go outside, I'd guess they're mainly comprised of the people who were already spending all their time on social media anyway.</p>

        <p>Or old-ish people. My mum is 53 and so militant on the rules. She has only broke the rules once and that was letting me my sister and my brother (we all see eachother all the time so we’re basically one household) in her kitchen on Christmas, yet she still opened all the doors and all the windows and sat at the opposite end of the kitchen.</p>

        <p>One of my UK friends reached out to me last summer. He isn't buying any of this shit either, and would fit in perfectly in this sub, but I've noticed the rest of my friends there either think y'all aren't locked down hard enough or everybody needs to mask up and vaccinate. I'm sorry. I wish I could rescue my sane friend, but he seems to be doing alright mentally somehow.</p>

        <p>It is. It's a fucking embarassment of a country, populated by arseholes. It's a sad thing to acknowledge, but the majority of our contemporaries are just really, really stupid. Fucking vacuous chumps, always susceptible to moral panics and herd-mentality. They revel in enforcing rules on each other. They believe in this "just doing my bit" communitarian fantasy, which essentially equates to a kind of curtain-twitching fascism. And it's popular because these imbeciles lead utterly stultifying lives and this shit gives them a sense of purpose they've never had. It's a kind of all-encompassing societal ignorance - a whole nation of people who are just plain ignorant of <em>how</em> to live happily, so they occupy their time with confected shite. A populace ruled by distraction, tittle-tattle and contrived drama, all mediated by the televised media spectacle and social media. Fuck this country! </p>
<p><strong>however</strong></p>
<p>I'd say there's a small percentage of "true believers" in lockdowns and doomerism, and a massive majority of sheep who'll go whatever way the wind blows. And it doesnt take a majority to be on-board with us, in order to enact the change we want. As Fidel Castro (I know) said, "I began the revolution with 82 men. If I had to do it again, I would do it with 10 or 15 and absolute faith. It does not matter how small you are if you have faith and a plan of action”.</p>
<p>I'd argue we're a sizeable minority of the population, and the New Abnormal agenda cannot succeed as long as we exist and stand firm. As we make our presence felt, we will influence the sheep and, eventually, things will turn in our favour. We will be a major spanner in the works, in regard to the establishment's plans. Our organised, steadfast resistance to this abnormal evil will triumph. But only so long as we do not back down!</p>

        <p>People in the uk are too relaxed, that’s the problem. Drop all restrictions tomorrow and they’ll go back to normal. Tell them they need to wear ten masks when shopping and they’ll do it. The sad reality is, the powers that be know it.</p>

        <p>There's definitely a lot of people who buy into it. But part of the problem is it's not as organic as you think. And a lot of what people believe now is because of what they see other's posting - they're parroting what the perceive to be the popular opinion when much of it is false.</p>
<p>[The WHO is monitoring online conversations and emotions, using “social listening” to change COVID narratives - Machine learning analysis is being used on people's conversations.] (https://reclaimthenet.org/who-is-monitoring-online-conversations/)</p>
<p>&rt; The company has been creepily scanning more than 1.6 million social media posts each week to monitor online conversation ....The WHO’s aim is to learn the coronavirus topics that are gaining popularity so that it can then create its own content to counteract and attempt to change the narrative.</p>
<p>This Guardian article from 2015 on "non-lethal warfare" to counter the spread of "disinformation" - <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/31/british-army-facebook-warriors-77th-brigade">"British army creates team of Facebook warriors"</a> </p>
<p>&rt; The British army is creating a special force of Facebook warriors, skilled in psychological operations and use of social media to engage in unconventional warfare in the information age. The 77th Brigade, to be based in Hermitage, near Newbury, in Berkshire, will be about 1,500-strong and formed of units drawn from across the army. The brigade will be responsible for what is described as non-lethal warfare. Both the Israeli and US army already engage heavily in psychological operations. Against a background of 24-hour news, smartphones and social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, the force will attempt to control the narrative. Soldiers with journalism skills and familiarity with social media are among those being sought.</p>

<p>&rt; Within China, the CCP has long paid hundreds of thousands of social media propagandists and also pays for posts on an a la carte basis, totaling hundreds of millions of propaganda comments each year. More recently, these activities have gone global and escalated dramatically during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
