    <strong>The Proof On The Online Pro-Lockdowners In The " New Normal"... There Shills!</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/31/british-army-facebook-warriors-77th-brigade">https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/31/british-army-facebook-warriors-77th-brigade</a> </p>
<p>The brigade will be responsible for what is described as non-lethal warfare. Both the Israeli and US army already engage heavily in psychological operations.</p>
<p>Against a background of 24-hour news, smartphones and social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, the force will attempt to control the narrative.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/defence-and-security-blog/2015/feb/02/british-army-ukraine">https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/defence-and-security-blog/2015/feb/02/british-army-ukraine</a> </p>
<p>The emphasis now is not so much on military force but "political  warfare", including psychological operations (psyops), deception, and media operations (hence the numerous references in recent stories by defence journalists to "facebook warriors"). </p>
<p>Disrupting communications and spreading and countering sophisticated propaganda will be the new Chindits' priorities but the environment they will operate in will be very different from that of the Burmese jungle. </p>

<p>Have you ever come across someone on the Internet that you suspected was a paid government troll? Well, there is a very good chance that you were not imagining things.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/No-Place-Hide-Snowden-Surveillance/dp/1250062586?tag=permacultucom-20&amp;linkCode=w13&amp;linkID=&amp;ref_=assoc_res_sw_cr_dka_cra_t0_result_1&amp;ref-refURL=http%3A%2F%2Factivistpost.net%2Fbanners%2Famazon.htm">Edward Snowden</a>, we now have solid proof that paid government trolls are using  “psychology-based influence techniques” on social media websites such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. Documents leaked by Snowden also reveal that government agents have been conducting denial-of-service attacks, flooding social media websites with thinly veiled propaganda, and have  been purposely attempting to warp public discourse online. If we do not stand up and object to this kind of Orwellian behavior, it is only going to get worse and worse.</p>

        <p>This sub seems to be winning against the trolls but r/maskskepticism is being heavily brigaded. It’s so obvious those aren’t all regular people just going on Reddit. There seem to be two types: those with fake concern sharing their “intelligence” and total psychopaths acting like bullies.</p>

        <p>Yes I’ve been wondering <em>why</em> the mask subreddit specifically is under attack. Why does there seem to be such a huge and unrelenting push for total mask enforcement over the past month, 4 months since we knew of Covid 19, probably about 9 months of it actually being present here?</p>

        <p>I’m waiting that too and am not convinced it’s because they give a shit about people’s health. It’s about control. But now that they’ve “won” by making masks mandatory nearly everywhere, what is the next step? Mandatory masks for those that refuse the vaccine and those that comply can go bare faced?</p>

        <p>Spread the word about the social media shills... More people need to be aware it's almost all a brain wash online, trying to submit people through public conformity. From North America to Middle East and Europe, the news is almost all the same and parrot the same content... It's almost like main stream media and social media exist now solely for the purpose of propaganda and normalization of the agenda for the global deep state. Whether it would be pushing war, demonizing China ( fuck the chinese government ), shitting on trump or whatever the soup of the day is, BLM or masks, the global media seem to always be synchronized in pushing narratives.</p>
<p>The television was the method of choice from the 50s-90s, in the 21st century tho, propaganda and agenda shilling for governments and the global deep state have moved online.</p>

        <p>It’s true. And that’s why it’s important to keep alternative news sites alive. Social media has been compromised so much that people don’t realize how algorithms are censoring what they see and what they post. It’s crazy how some people’s personalities seem to have changed lately due to all the propaganda. I don’t know how far down the rabbit hole you want to go, but I suspect things like neurolinguistic programming and subliminal messages. There’s probably techniques that I don’t even know about but I’m 100% sure of shills, especially on social media like Reddit where most people are anonymous.</p>
