    <strong>Personal experience, masks do affect breathing!</strong>
    <p><p>I'm a healthy person, not asthmatic, not diabetic or anything. Although I don't exercise a lot but I usually have no problem walking a mile or two. BMI 21.</p>
<p>I'd an exam for which I had to go to different university campus where masks were mandatory. It was a three hour exam and masks were to be wore throughout, otherwise you can't sit for it.</p>
<p>I'd to walk a mile within the campus to reach the exam hall. It was difficult for me to breathe with the mask on, by the time I reached the hall I was already uncomfortable. And it was really difficult to sit three hours with the mask on throughout the exam.</p>
<p>The weather also didn't help. If you walk, run for a distance or climb stairs, you need deeper breaths to relax. Which becomes difficult with a mask on. Especially if you can't remove it for long period of time.</p>
<p>Even if you believe that masks work or that they should be mandatory, at least be honest about how uncomfortable they actually are. At least acknowledge that doing heavy activity or wearing for extended periods does affect breathing.</p></p>

        <p>"Masks don't affect breathing" is one of the most blatant examples of the 'piss on my back and tell me it's raining' rhetoric we are being fed.</p>
<p>Sure, maybe it's less noticeable in some situations when you aren't breathing hard but I am actually quite experienced with masks and exercise from winter sports and it's pretty damn obvious and instinctual to pull it off at times when you are gasping for air from exertion.</p>

        <p>I have a hard time breathing in them without fail. I have sinus issues, so perhaps related, but I just can’t believe the blatant lie people try to sell me when they say they’re harmless / don’t affect breathing. Absurd.</p>

        <p>They really do and like someone else said it is very dangerous to our brains. The other day a strap on one of my big cup masks that I put large enough holes in to at least not collapse from the lack of fresh air I'm breathing so the only other options was one of those tight to mouth blue medical one's that also get gross very quickly. I had my nose out most of the time and made sure only to breathe though that. But then big manager guy demands I put it over my nose and he was up there the whole time so I didn't get a air break besides sneaking a breath here and there. </p>
<p>In under half an hour I'm already getting very tired, my cognitive functions decline, I'm much slower mentally, and I can't do my job properly. If that went on a whole shift I would have passed out. They may affect some people more or less but its still doing damage under the surface.</p>

        <p>Without affecting breathing, masks <strong>cannot</strong> work. Restricting airflow is the only mechanism would make them work at all.</p>
