    <strong>Why is it so hard for folks to see this is a scam?</strong>
    <p><p>I know it's because they are sheep and all that. Seriously though why don't people see it? It's been a year, we made it past the first big spike of cases and deaths, we have vaccines and other most vulnerable have made it past "Phase 1". Do we really need to keep the restrictions going when the most vulnerable are either protected with the vaccine or have antibodies? Why do so many healthy Americans need the shot? </p>
<p>Trying to reach 75% herd immunity with vaccinations is implying that 75% of the population is unhealthy people. One day I remember looking at my folks and asked them "Do you think people are actually dying of Covid or something else?" Of course they would ask me what I meant and I would say "What if they were dying of something else but they also have Covid?" That's the big red flag here. There are so many other ways you could die with Covid in your system, but they can write it off and say it was "Covid Related". </p>
<p>For a virus to be the sole reason you died one would think a healthy person would die from it. I'm sure some folks may have actually died from it, but not over 500,000 solely due to Covid. I'm willing to bet at least 400,000 had other health problems the media didn't disclose. </p>
<p>Once they continued to push the narrative that more people need to get vaccinated after "Phase 1" and especially "Phase 2" should have been red flags. However the biggest red flag of all is vaccine passports. Imagine this you are going to an event and feel great. No temperature, No coughing, etc. You show up and all the sudden they tell you that your "Covid Positive". Instead of enjoying the game, movie, etc. That you paid money for they not only say you can't attend it, but make you stay in a hotel nearby for two weeks to "quarantine".</p>
<p>That one day you had planned to go to an event, movie, etc. that you traveled to now turned into a 2 week stay. A two week stay doesn't sound too bad right? Well except you didn't plan for it. You let your boss know you were going out of town for the weekend, but not for two weeks. So now not only are they screwed without you for two weeks, but you're now isolated and watched over to make sure you get a "negative" result before you head home. </p>
<p>And that's the life some people want?</p></p>

        <p>I often ask myself the same question but then think back to the beginning of last spring when I too was happy to social distance and wear a mask. But then I realize that there were hardly any voices speaking out against the measures back then. There were no studies being published about the harmful effects of masks or lockdowns (save the fact that it had been previously widely accepted that those are harmful). Even if you read solely mainstream media, it’s your duty to go and research these mysterious “anti-lockdowners” when they are covered in the press. Everyone who still supports these measures is simply too stubborn and too arrogant to accept the truth</p>

        <p>A few reasons I've noticed.</p>
<p>One - people wether professionals or normies.... Have a genuine desire to do the right thing, to be genuinely virtuous - unfortunately this human need is easily highjacked and railed into the narrative and creates an extra level of identification. I fell for it with the Iraq war intially for similar reasons. I.e. "I'm a Dr, I've been training my whole life to help people - this is MY war."</p>
<p>Two - when someone starts to listen to their own common sense/gut... Admitting something doesn't make sense - the question often comes "so what is the meaning/agenda/it's all a bit conspiracy?".... The ramifications of the scam are so widespread. That it fundamentally challenges ones (false) world view threatening to make the world a much more dark and dangerous place.</p>
<p>Three - people often don't like being wrong.</p>
<p>Four - fear of ostracism, punishment, ridicule.</p>
<p>Etc..</p>
<p>Here's a good article exploring it.</p>

        <p>I think because they're only thinking about themselves and only thinking about the short-term. By having our views they suffer, constantly. By having theirs, well they get patted on the back don't they. They don't want to do what's right, they want to <em>feel</em> like they're doing what's right and they get so much positive feedback from following the crowd that that's what they end up doing.</p>

        <p>For some weird reason, yes people want that life. They’ve bought into everything and are willing to give up basic freedoms and essentially have their movements monitored if they’re told it will keep them same from Covid. People have been convinced that Covid is the worst thing in the world and if they get it it’s almost a death sentence. It doesn’t matter what stats they see showing mortality rates for not at risk individuals, they just throw back the variants nonsense or some other programmed responses. It’s crazy.</p>
