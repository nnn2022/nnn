    <strong>They are changing up their methods of propaganda, I just noticed</strong>
    <p><p>"I'm wearing the mask to protect you" and "stay home or you're killing grandma"</p>
<p>now it's "I got vaccinated to protect others" and they are switching from protect grandma to "get vaccinated to protect the children since they can't get vaccinated yet"</p>

        <p>Both the original commenter and your statistics are really disingenuous.</p>
<p>Suppose your numbers are correct, you aren’t taking into factor the number of children who actually got infected. Sure 277 died but it was only due to lockdowns and measures to stop the spread. That 277 would be a lot higher than the 1840 you say, had there been no lockdown measures.</p>

        <p>Not so considering the CDC put children between the ages of 2- 17 as least likely to succumb to the virus. If we are really jumping down this rabbit hole take into consideration what percentage of your 277 had prior illness or weakened immunity due to medical history. Sssssoooooo my number of 1840 are actual reported abuse cases, how many of those 277 are honestly 100% healthy to begin with? </p>
<p>Your oppinion that "277 could have been worse" is dwarfed by the damage it had already caused. Lockdown counties when compared to unlocked down counties posted same numbers, the fallacy you saved someone by staying home was already proven wrong.</p>

        <p>There is no merit in comparing between countries. It means almost nothing. We don’t use public transport much at all in America, we have online infrastructure secure and ready. We have healthcare that isn’t garbage. With all of this we still were absolutely devastated by the virus.</p>
<p>If you don’t think staying home saved your life, it might have saved many people close to me as well as myself.</p>

        <p>America uses public transportation, I use public transportation 4 times a week along with homeless population who has been unaffected by covid pandemic. </p>
<p>Our online infrastructure is too heavily relied on and could crash our entire nation/modern world. The American healthcare system is fantastic, free anything is never the answer. I love knowing I can go get a hernia fixed or a tumor removed same day. Where as waiting 5 months in Canada is a joke, and the notion of free healthcare is a lie in itself if people are taxed insanely to cover it.</p>
<p>I disagree with your final statement the most, I could spend all day telling you why you're wrong. If you're happy with how things went for you great, I lost too much family this past year unrelated to Covid-19. Covid prevented me from seeing my father unplugged and prevented me from burying my grandfather. My niece to be died suddenly after being born and instead of sids her and my father's death certificates both claimed Covid19 when neither had exposure nore a test at the time of death.
I am full vaccinated (excluding covid) though I don't get the regular flu shot every year as I think its unnecessary and why we have immune systems. I have worn masks for months until finding out they don't do much from the CDC themselves.</p>
<p>We are not devastated at all, the media portrays we are. An illness with a 99.8 % survival rate does not justify shutting down the world plain and simple. Covid was over reacted to just like swine flu, bird flu and all those other "pandemics". Lockdowns helped nothing but lining the pockets of government officials. Every 1,000$ in relief will be 5,000$ owed by future children and grandchildren. Do with this information what you will, you're not going to convince me by telling me your country is better or vice versa.</p>

        <p>Those are that died "involving covid" so they could be a 500 lb 17 year old with serious health problems... also 179 died of the flu in same time frame. Also with liberal death counting, they could have had the flu, cancer, suicide, but test positive for covid so called covid death. The death rate for the virus is literally anyone dying for any reason any other year for the age group. No excess deaths.</p>
