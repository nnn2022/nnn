    <strong>Anyone got the links that show how many people have died in America in 2020 to 2019???</strong>
    <p><p>I saw someone post a photo how in Cananda the death count of 2020 is pretty much identical to 2019 </p>
<p>And in Australia nursing home deaths where the virus has only killed people is down 1000 
Well as flu cases/deaths drastically going down</p>
<p>And in Italy 99% of those who died with covid actually died of other things (I assume the death rate would be the same as last year got to double check) </p>
<p>But does anyone have a chart that compares deaths in 2019 compared to 2020? This can also kinda show how many deaths cause of lockdown have been caused</p>
<p>And how only 6% of the people marked as covid, had no "co-morbiditys" in America</p></p>

        <p>CDC fluview interactive has this data bit it isn't normalized for population change and it's week by week with several weeks of delay for complete data.  MMWR season is typically Oct to Oct so 2020 MMWR season just ended and it will be several weeks before the data can be compared to previous years</p>
