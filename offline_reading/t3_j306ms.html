What we've got here is failure to communicate
Some men, you just can't reach
So, you get what we had here, last week

Well, he gets it..."</p>

        <p>SS:</p>
<p>Thanks to the U.K. Column (30th September)</p>
<ol>
<li>Pushing the military as the only ones capable of distributing the vaccines. Something wrong with supermarkets/ grocery stores? Any excuse to roll out the army. Once here, like all these measures, they will not go away, and most likely will be used to quell popular uprisings and enforce mandatory measures.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, we are already seeing the U.K. army on the streets:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Again seeding the notion that, without the vaccine, there will be no freedom to work, travel or participate in regular social activities. The vaccine will be the only ransom or parole from our home imprisonment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Government, local authorities, police, military in collision with private corporate interests is fascism. Our slightly watered-down version will be communitarianism. Same basic principles at play.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All this for a virus that, if you believe their own statistics, died out 2 or 3 months ago and now poses no imminent threat to the public whatsoever.</p>
<p>Of course, with the decision to once again introduce infected patients to care homes, we can virtually guarantee a “second wave” slap bang in the middle of the flu season.</p>

        <p>And the latter is 100% deliberate. They want to manufacture more hysteria to keep the lockdowns going another year, and so on, and so forth, until eternity as is the plan in every western country.</p>
<p>If a vaccine ever arrives, it still will not be enough.</p>

        <p>The implications of this are terrifying - using the Armed Forces to carry a partisan government's water and as enforcers against its own population. <em>This is literally how you get tyranny!</em></p>
<p>Here in Canada, they tried to slip through this sort of "info ops" (AKA propaganda) task with our armed forces, too. To his credit, our CDS squashed it when it showed up on his desk. But I fully expect our corrupt government of NWO ideologues will try again.</p>
<p>It's being driven by senior officer-bureaucrats who have nothing better to do since the war in Afghanistan ended - the language used in the documents is literally a cut and paste from the bullshit "nation building/whole of government engagement" CIMIC good-idea fairies that infested that theatre of operations.</p>
<p>Since they don't have a war to fight, they will happily settle for building a bureaucratic empire based on treating their own populace as the enemy.</p>
<p>It's a great springboard to lucrative consulting, civil service, and political posts after retirement...</p>
