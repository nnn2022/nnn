    <strong>Japan 90% Normal - WHY?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m American living in Japan, been here since 2001 and since May things have been getting back to normal. Well, almost... People still walk around in mask inside and even outside, signs in stores telling people to wear them and social distance and some stores with thermal cameras before entering.</p>
<p>But it is NOT forced upon us, I been walking around since March without a mask and never really have an issue. People do not harass or attack you for not wearing one, nor do police fine or arrest you. I’ve only had one store ask me to leave for not wearing a mask, and they did so in a very polite way and apologized constantly to me for it. I’ve seen many others walking around without a mask as well. </p>
<p>All business and schools have been open normally since May and stores and restaurants are constantly packed full of people. Especially lately due to the holidays, places are packed like crazy. We couldn’t social distance here even if they tried to force it, it’s impossible.  Trains are packed full, especially in larger cities like Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto and Fukuoka where your slammed in there like a sardine in a can.</p>
<p>Gradually we been aloud to attend concerts, sporting events and other events as well. At first they limited it, actually drawing names of people who wanted to attend and limiting the amount of people. But for the last couple of months, they allow anyone and ask people to wear a mask but do not force it.  These events have been full of people all close together and we’ve never had any problems.</p>
<p>People been meeting their friends and family, gathering together to enjoy food or travel. So many have traveled to spend time with family members for New Years.</p>
<p>Cases of the Rona have been low, until yesterday when they reported 1,307 cases in Tokyo but that number is very low considering Tokyo has a population of over 9 million people.</p>
<p>So why am I saying all this? Well because it makes absolutely no sense at all for other countries like America, England and Australia to be locked down keeping small businesses and restaurants closed or forced to dine outside, not having concerts or sporting events, keeping schools closed or virtual schooling and forcing restrictions upon the people. They continue to report cases and claim hospitals are packed over capacity and people are dying. Yet how can that be when in these countries people are more spread out and many things are shut down?!  Especially America, where it is a massive country with plenty of room and people spread out all over. It makes NO SENSE for these countries to be so restricted forcing people into poverty, yet Japan a country right next door to China and a tiny country slammed full of people close together is pretty much living life normal and have been for numerous months now. We have never been locked down and forced to comply with stupid rules, yet we been fine.</p>
<p>I‘ve known CV19 is a hoax since day one, nothing more than a massive false flag to usher in NWO like restrictions and rules. People with the common cold, allergies, the flu or other illnesses are being told it’s corona and they believe it because #1 they are sick #2 the corrupt PCR test #3 doctors and nurses tell them it’s Covid </p>
<p>But the fact Japan is 90% normal and other countries are still “fucked up” just goes to show they are lying to the masses and uses Covid as an excuse to remove freedoms and enforce new restrictions.</p>
<p>People over on the r/coronaCoronavirus section  always  say,  ”Japan  is  a  place  where  they  have  always  worn  mask  and  they  are  social  distancing there”</p>
<p>Total BS... People here only wear mask when sick, allergies or China pollution blows over and like I said above, we couldn’t social distance here even if we tried and wanted.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Proof Japan is almost normal, we had the Rizin K1 fights last night for New Years Eve live event where they allowed tons of people to attend. Yes, they had to wear mask but the place was packed and they allow fighters to fight normal with no mask and full contact. Spit and blood flying all over the place and no one panicking over it.</p>

        <p>Then why are obese Japanese not dropping dead? (Yes, they do exist.)</p>
<p>The real answer is that the government is fixing the numbers, and the media is cherry picking cases to demonstrate how dEaDlY the virus is.</p>

        <p>The same reason people in nursing homes might die more than if home with family, sheer numbers of compromised people. Such a huge percent of Americans are obese, and obesity kills the immune system, there arent enough strong healthy people with good immune systems to shield them.</p>

        <p>No, it isn't. Otherwise that light as a feather ballerina and the extreme bodybuilder would not have caught this disease and nearly died.</p>
<p>It ain't obesity that is the issue... I am 99% sure that it is "Low... no FATALLY low levels of C, D and Zinc!"</p>

        <p>The ballerina was probably anorexic or had some other eating disorder like bulimia which affects the heart, common victims of Covid have heart problems. The body builder most definitely was taking steroids which suppresses the immune system. Not really surprised about those deaths. Those people only "looked" healthy.</p>

        <p>Lack of widespread testing, not warehousing the elderly in shitty nursing homes, and most importantly, low obesity rate. If our health officials here in America actually wanted to us to improve our health and lessen the burden of COVID (among other diseases), they would be encouraging the public to exercise and improve their diet.</p>

        <p>They are testing all over here, they actually even have test stores you can walk in and get tested. They also sell kits at some stores.</p>

        <p>Japan has performed 4.8 Million tests in total. The United States has performed 253 Million. That puts the US at 763,000 tests per Million and Japan at 38,000 tests per million. And while I believe that Japan is doing testing right, they really are not in the same league as most other developed nations when it comes to mass testing numbers. Almost every country in Europe and North America has tested over 300,000 tests per million. Japan is 149th in the world in tests per million.</p>

        <p>It's the same reason Redditors salivate over packed bars in NZ but hiss at the same thing in Tampa. It's the same reason why if you ever mention Sweden, they point out they had more deaths than their neighbors, even if that makes no sense in context. People want to believe that if you "follow the rules," no COVID. But since the evidence contradicts that, they distort it.</p>
<p>Japan is too perfect because they had no lockdown and few deaths (unlike Sweden and Florida). So they just dismiss it. It doesn't fit in their narrative.</p>

        <p>People always think Japanese wear mask, especially during this BS pandemic. But many haven’t been and are never forced. I went out yesterday and saw numerous women walking around normal. Made me felt so happy, I always greet and high five anyone not in a mask and tell them nice smile.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I hate the fetishization of Japan that I see on Reddit. Yes, including in this sub.</p>
<p>It's not a perfect country, and I think /u/alone_in_the_crowd is right, in spite of being downvoted. If there is an agenda going on, I think they aren't going after Japan because the nation is on a decline. Their military force is a joke, and their population is dwindling. The Japanese citizens tend to be overall obedient, and conformist.</p>

        <p>I have many Japanese friends.  They are all laughing at us.  We have no idea how to handle a crisis.</p>

        <p>This is exactly what I’ve seen living here too. I was working at a restaurant this year but quit because it was too busy. The ‘go to eat’ and ‘go to travel’ campaign was forcing me to work overtime everyday. We had a line waiting out front from June-November when I finally couldn’t handle it anymore. </p>
<p>A lot of people still take it very serious. It’s bizarre. More people died during the flu season of 2018 and nobody batted an eye. The power of mass media is unbelievable.</p>

        <p>Do you know if there is a 14-day quarantine requirement there for residents? </p>
<p>Also, is travel allowed there from North America? </p>
<p>My son is moving there this spring and I'm hoping to go visit.</p>

        <p>Pcr tests are a terrible way to assess disease penetration, but two things that do impact the positive count are how many tests you run, and who you test. It is likely some countries are testing fewer and not using the same nonrandom selection strategies.</p>
<p>Japan could truly have the same number of (actual) cases as the US and not know it because it doesn't actually matter. </p>
<p>Or they could have better immunity from more exposures to similar colds. We really don't have the data available to say. Some do, and it's very interesting that it isn't being shared.</p>
