    <strong>I am not ashamed of taking the virus seriously for the first 2 to 4 weeks.</strong>
    <p><p>I've been thinking about this and I feel like I was doing the reasonable thing by following the stay at home orders the first 2 weeks just incase it was going to be something that's actually dangerous even the first 2 week extension was pushing it for me but I gave them the benefit of the doubt but then when the science started coming out and saying it wasnt as dangerous as we first thought I was done with the political lockdown nonsense.</p></p>

        <p>For me i started smelling bullshit when the media would focus on "cases" so much instead of hospital capacity or deaths. Then it became clear it wasnt just about " flattening the curve" anymore</p>
<p>In my mind it was always the more cases we have the better it is if they arent seriously sick because its a way to herd immunity</p>

        <p>I flipped as soon as the media started caring about it at all. I followed it for months previously through whatever trickled out of china, not sure if it was china being china or an actual thing. Fortunately I can trust that the truth is usually the opposite of whatever the media claims is true.</p>

        <p>I remember thinking "I should try to limit how much I'm out and about while this virus is around" when my office sent us home. That night I went to a brewery that I frequent and I asked if they were gonna close, to which they responded, "LMFAO No, we've had great business recently." And then they were forced to close. That's when I realized a shitshow was about to occur.</p>

        <p>I mean who wasn't.  Even though I knew it was a bunch of bullshit.  (I was calling conspiracy in march) I still took precautions to prevent having a bad cough. I've had bronchitis.  And I am also a hypochondriac.  I didn't watch the news.  I ONLY researched the proper information that was pertinent to my health like bleach water solution, hand sanitizer and proper homemade face covering. I quarantined/sanitized everything that came into my apartment. I never subscribed to fear porn because knowing what celebrity caught it or fat ass who breathed hard because of it, was ABSOLUTELY IRRELEVANT to my situation.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, I didn't want to be hacking up phlegm while trying to do all this running around outside.  Even though the Flu and cold only cost me one day of work in my entire lifetime. This time I had a couple hundred stacked up, so I took 2 weeks off and did my unusual hypochondriac panic routine. This was also convenient because I was awaiting a new contract approval. Once approved,  I had a bouy of food poisoning buy gotten so tired of being inside and burning through my savings I went back to work. </p>
<p>I work outside and touch A LOT of door knobs so I always had a bottle of alcohol handy, years before covid. This is why I never understood hoarding. Now,  all of the markets are now re-stocked with cleaner, alcohol,  toilet paper and hand soap so I guess since people are emotionally invested in MaSkS , they just wipe their ass with their hands after they shit, and proceed to make themselves a sandwich. Seems legit.</p>

        <p>Cleaning products are still largely wiped out where I live (small township, less than 5,000 population). It really does feel like no one ever cleaned their house before the coronavirus. Last time I went to Walmart for paper towels the shelves were largely empty and it took me a trip to three stores to find something decent. And four stores for the bathroom cleaner.</p>

        <p>I'm annoyed I still can't buy isopropyl alcohol (I use it for cleaning things like electronics) or oddly, Windex. Are people hoarding window cleaner?? It doesn't even kill viruses unless you buy the special disinfectant version.</p>

<p>Because most people don't use rubbing alcohol all that much, at least not enough to consider stocking up. However, the initial panic buying and product shortages sparked a cycle of even more panic buying and product shortages, because many people reconsidered the need for certain products and weren't sure how long the shortages would last. My area still hasn't recovered from the panic buying.</p>

        <p>Yeah the models said millions would die even with lockdowns. I was sick with it already (presumably, since I had all the symptoms) when my area closed down, so I stayed home for two weeks and had food delivered. I felt like I was a few weeks ahead of everyone even then in terms of rejecting hysteria, maybe having it and not dying helped me see the light. Now I feel months ahead of most people since they still think the lockdown saved more lives than it ruined or ended. But, being both pragmatic and skeptical initially is "believing" science, the whole point of science is to update your views based on new information.</p>

        <p>I relaxed after the protests when I saw gov officials say you should go to the protests during a pandemic. And then everything was confirmed further 2 weeks after the protest when thousands of people wernt dying. Iv been researching this almost everyday since then. For months I TRIED to find credible information saying this was getting worse and out of control but its been in control since the end of March. Covid is real but blown out of proportion the people saying its fake make us look so bad.</p>

        <p>I have a theory that <strong><em>everyone</em></strong> had some fear at first. We actually believed it was novel.  We actually believed the Chinese government that hospitals were overflowing. We actually believed it could be a virus that could kill one or more percent of the population irrespective of age, <em>which is terrifying.</em></p>
<p>But then to your point, some of us started digging into the numbers. Asked questions...maybe challenged the rhetoric after they ~~quarantined us~~ put society on house arrest. </p>
<p>Maybe I’m naive, but I actually think the initial round of lockdowns from state governments was a self preservation move - <strong><em>no one</em></strong> wanted to be the poster child for mass death. But then I personally started to see a trend where once there was more data, certain ~~governors~~ dictators became the tyrants that many make them out to be...and then we figured out we can <strong>politicize</strong> the lockdown...<strong><em>WELCOME TO HELL</em></strong> - now you get masks, people who are <em>violently</em> afraid of the general population, and a religious following for Science^^TM.  It’s like we have ~~people~~ <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaver_(Firefly)">reavers</a> in the streets of California ready to prey on someone not wearing a mask or a wearing MAGA hat (I now wonder what they would do to someone with a MAGA mask...lol). </p>
<p>The amount of permanent damage that has been done to our society through physical, psychological, and financial harm is unforgivable.  I cannot believe that we have actually put up with this, but I hope these ~~politicians~~ communists get theirs....</p>

        <p>When I first found out I wasn't worried at all as I thought it would be just like bird flu etc, which were all no big deal. I was concerned about the virus once everyone started making a fuss about Italy and restrictions started being introduced. I spoke to my doctors about it - my specialist was completely unconcerned about me, and fully supported living life as normal, while my GP reassured me that our healthcare system was unlikely to become overwhelmed (as in Italy) and that my fears of being denied treatment were totally unfounded.</p>
<p>I think this is a reasonable response - reacting to fear by seeking information from a trusted medical professional (someone who knows me and my body - not some bozo on the TV).</p>

        <p>I'm always the type to say "Better safe than sorry." When initially hearing about the shit going on in China,Covid did seem like a serious threat. However,considering that it is mostly a respiratory disease and China has the shittiest air quality,it would not really be a surprise. Still,I figured a couple of weeks of being cautious wouldn't hurt,sure we'll go along with this flatten the curve BS...except the goalposts kept shifting. I am at a point now where I can clearly see this is not going to be the apocalypse that everyone made it out to be and I am thoroughly irritated that our general lives and economy have been uprooted for pointless reasons. And just about anytime I see one of my friends posting up about masks and "we're still in a pandemic" it makes me lose a bit more respect for them and humanity as a whole.</p>

        <p>Yeah definitely. When I heard China was locking down to stop the spread of the virus I was concerned. I was resigned to the fact that the US would face mass casualties because we'd never allow ourselves to lockdown like that... except we did. And surely that meant coronavirus was a serious threat. </p>
<p>For the first two months I was anticipating all hell to break lose at anytime. There was a rise in cases and deaths, but nowhere near the level they'd predicted. Hospitals were nowhere near capacity and the initial death projections for my state, even the best case scenario, was off by orders of magnitude.</p>

My wife was constantly wanting to go out for this or that and I told her not to, went shopping one time in the first 4 weeks, obsessively sanitizing, the whole nine yards. I can't believe people are still living like that almost 6 months later. People haven't seen their families in that time. Bonkers.</p>

        <p>Same here. I was absolutely terrified for the first maybe three weeks. Then I began to question and to trust my own reasoning and observation skills. It became very clear very quickly.</p>
<p>I'm pretty hard on these lockdown, mask-wearing fools--because I was once one of them--and if I can wake up and get a clue, fucking so can they. The reality is there--for anyone who is not too stupid, too ignorant, or too fearful to see it.</p>

        <p>I was happy to stay at home for two weeks to help stop hospitals getting overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Yes. I fell for that bullshit. I was always concerned that this was the start of some massive conspiracy but to avoid unnecessary deaths, I agreed to stay at home for a bit.</p>
<p>As soon as they extended it indefinitely and hospitals were clearly not filling up and the stink of bullshit became unavoidable if you had a functioning brain, I was arguing against government overreach. It took me abut a week and a half and I was always suspicious but I knew that I didn't know enough, at first.</p>
<p>I will not even fall for it for one day next time. Governments should never use their power to lock down. Inform, educate, and let people come to their own conclusions. Unfortunately, our society hasn't worked like that for a while.</p>

        <p>We all took/take it seriously, and there's no shame in that. I personally was never okay with any lockdown measures. By mid-March I was already finding myself shocked at how quickly everyone gave up their rights gladly in exchange for a little dopamine rush from ratting their neighbors out on social media. I even texted a friend at the time and said "I'm already pissed off about who's benefitting from this while we get fucked over." It was clear it would become the new 9/11, the new Patriot Act, ushering in a new era of control and manipulation. It's a lot like the fallout from 9/11 and the intro of the Iraq War given how much the media has to do with where we're at right now.</p>

        <p>I thought for the first couple of weeks that my mother or I would surely get it, especially since she's a retail worker, but after about a month went by and there were hardly any cases in my area (aside from a couple of senior's home outbreaks) I started thinking this was less serious than people thought. In Ontario, it's really a "city problem" and they tell you not to become complacent if you're in a rural area, but there really have been hardly any cases in rural areas (outside of senior's homes). I actually think in my region that we might have had it already earlier in the winter, given that people are actually going and getting tested but they're all coming up negative.</p>

        <p>Well duh numbers from Italy suggested a 10% case fatality rate.  </p>
<p>But then "two weeks" kept getting indefinitely extended.</p>
<p>Then governments and people condemned anyone who protested against lockdowns, but cheered on protests from "approved" movements.</p>
<p>Then Antibodies tests came out of NYC</p>
<p>Then it became clear that places were developing herd immunity with less than 0.1% of the population dying.</p>
<p>Then places with herd immunity saw the excess death rate drop <em>below</em> average.</p>
<p>Anyone who still supports lockdowns in spite of all this new information is a sheep.  I still think COVID is more dangerous than "just a flu" but not by nearly as much as we originally feared.</p>

        <p>&lt;&lt;I mean who wasn’t?&rt;&rt;</p>
<p>I wasn’t. Not boasting, just stating a fact. I never had a moment’s anxiety about the virus and I’m 63. Can’t fully explain it. I suppose I never believed it was the black plague, because we had reassuring IFR data from the start. And call me heartless, but hearing about nursing home residents dying in large numbers didn’t horrify me. What horrified me from the get-go was how we were transferring the burden of the crisis from older people like me to the young and the poor.</p>

        <p>I was concerned about the virus for a few weeks also, was one of the only few in my area wearing a mask during the peak, when it may have mattered. My biggest fear came from the Italy reports, people standing silent and apart from each other in shopping lines. It gave the immediate sense that society was bottoming out into some sort of doomsday.</p>
<p>After the initial prep phase (humans were always going to be the real danger), I started asking questions. It was very simple even in early to mid-April. They said the mortality rate in Italy for confirmed cases was 3.4%. OMG. But wait...they also said 10 times more people were probably infected that could be accounted for, especially with asymptomatic transmission, so 0.34%. Then found out the vast majority of deaths were very old, sick people.</p>
<p>May be several times more deadly than the flu, but still way way waaaaayyyy off the threshold we should be destroying civilization over.</p>

        <p>i mean, i don't really have anything to add to the discourse below regarding the numbers and statistics and the science, because like everyone else here, i'm okay being wrong and changing my mind. i'm also trying to be mindful about washing my hands and not crowding people's personal bubbles, but i'm not wearing a mask in public and i'm not staying home anymore. so basically, just how i behave during every cold/flu season, lol.</p>
<p>i will admit that i was scared shitless of this thing at first; i started following it in December/January in China, and it was fucking terrifying. my husband and i watched the videos on Twitter of people dropping dead in the middle of the street in Wuhan, of people getting welded into their apartments, of the field hospitals springing up in Hubei. i didn't trust the Chinese then and i certainly don't trust them now - i never trusted their numbers or their PCR tests. in February i started following some Russian models on IG who were basically stranded in Wuhan and shiposting on IG live all day. basically, i should have known then and there that covid-19 was a huge scam. they were like, "oh my god, i can't believe we're still stuck here, we're bored, we're not sick, it's not that bad, why can't we just go home?" typical teenage girl stuff, lol.</p>
<p>but then everything spiraled out of control in Lombardy, and then it spread to NYC. and it did look really fucking bad, and i bought into it, hook, line, and sinker. i panic shopped (i still have like, twelve boxes of wine in the basement, lol). i begged my husband to stop going to the gym. it really looked like this thing was coming for all the old Italian people. my father planned his OWN FUNERAL because he thought THE RONA WAS A'COMIN' FOR HIM because he's of Italian descent, over the age of 60, and male. my poor WASPy mother was at the short end of a short rope, lemme tell ya. (my dad is fine now, lol, he doesn't think this is going to kill him and he's accepted that, and he says he's made peace with death. we'll see, lol. he needs attention to live.) </p>
<p>i was terrified that the hospitals here would be overwhelmed, that the morgues would be full, that we'd be hearing sirens 24/7, that people i knew and loved would be dropping dead. i bought into that stupid Medium post, "The Hammer and the Dance." FLATTEN THE CURVE! STOMP THE CURVE! CARESS THE CURVE! jesus christ, i was brainwashed.</p>
<p>the last normal day was Friday, March 13th. i remember being in the office and trying to bring home as much i could so that i could telework for two weeks. (spoiler alert: i didn't have enough to do from home for two weeks, let alone two months, lol. thank god i've been back in the office since June, hahahah.) then my state locked down. we *really* thought we were only two weeks behind Italy or New York City. ("THE PEAK IS ONLY TWO WEEKS AWAY YOU GUYS, JUST WAIT AND SEE! TWO WEEKS!" - @ hysterical Twitter blue check)</p>
<p>but i woke up on Saint Patrick's Day, the economy had gone to hell, people were losing their goddamn minds, and i was like, "why are we doing this? it doesn't seem that bad. this is madness." i stopped watching the news or reading the paper, i started muting blue check hysterics on Twitter who were just throwing fuel on the panic porn fire. i never put "stay the fuck home" anywhere on my TL. i saw a tweet from a mutual to the tune of "can you believe that we'll be doing this for 6-8 weeks?!" I COULDN'T GET THAT OUT OF MY HEAD, IT KEPT ME AWAKE AT NIGHT. i had to quit IG because the agitprop was so bad and the virtue signaling so annoying. (you know why i like Instagram? i like puppies, kittens, other people's babies, birds, and food porn. that'sit. if IG stops giving me the content i demand, it's dead to me.) i feel like i took some sort of black pill and woke up a new skeptical person, like i had been reborn and could see clearly for the first time in a decade.</p>
<p>i was willing to give the Hammer and the Dance 15 days to slow the spread, maybe 30 days if they were lucky. i could do this for a month. it started to dawn on me that it would be a fuckton easier to isolate the truly vulnerable (the elderly, the immuno-compromised, the morbidly obese, etc) and let the rest of us keep on truckin', but apparently that's a super unpopular opinion, and i want to kill everyone's grandma. (i mean both of my grandmas are dead so i couldn't care less, really. they can't kill my grandmas so they shouldn't care either.)</p>
<p>no, no i cannot. i am an extrovert in quarantine. i'm Tracy Flick on house arrest. I'M TINKERBELL AND I NEED ATTENTION TO LIVE.</p>
<p>my husband and i went on a walk one day at lunch in early April. it was one of those cold, dreary, damp, grey days - the sort of spring day in Virginia that no one wants to think about really because they're absolutely miserable. and we're walking around our quiet, nice, well-kept suburb, and it's completely still outside. no children laughing or playing, no dog walkers, no wine moms out-and-about, no joggers. empty tennis courts, empty basketball court, taped-off playgrounds. every word hung in the air. just dead as a door nail. and the streets were empty - there were no cars. you see, in our area, there's always traffic, people always have somewhere to be, and they're usually in a hurry. there are *always* cars on the road. that was the creepy part - there were no fuckin' cars. you could literally stroll down the middle of a busy state road and not see a car for ten, fifteen minutes at a time. that day, we were the only souls under a cool marble sky.</p>
<p>well then, i broke with reality. i dashed out into the middle of the street, threw up my arms, and started shouting, "BRING OUT YER DEAD! BRING OUT YER DEAD!" i really and truly in that moment felt like i was in a bad Monty Python sketch and John Cleese would pop out from someone's garage and yell, "APRIL FOOLS!" my husband laughed. "BUT WHERE ARE THE BODIES, HONEY?!" i yelled. "WHERE ARE THE CARTS AND WAGONS FULL OF DEAD PEOPLE? THEY PROMISED ME PILES OF DEAD PEOPLE. WHERE ARE THE DEAD PEOPLE? WHERE ARE THE BODIES, HONEY?! BRING OUT YOUR DEAD!" and we walked home arm-in-arm right down the middle of the abandoned steet like something out of an off brand apocalypse movie, reciting Monty Python and the Holy Grail, making a great ruckus and being assholes-at-large.</p>
<p>the hospitals were never overwhelmed. the morgues never got full. we never heard more sirens than usual (in fact, we think we heard fewer.) they never treated any covid-19 patients at the Dulles Expo Center field hospital. the bodies never piled up in the streets. no one ever came around in a cart to collect them. we never started burning heaps and piles of dead bodies in the middle of the road. the armies of the dead never appeared. i'm a little disappointed, tbh. they promised me more dead bodies!</p>
<p>and now we're on day 160 of 15 Days to Slow the Spread (TM). the Hammer and the Dance! is this... is this what hell is like, lol?  🤦‍♀️</p>

        <p>While I am pleased you were able to exercise independent judgment and enlighten yourself after realizing the narrative was contradictory and wrong, I do not agree that it was reasonable to concede staying at home for 2 to 4 weeks. If we locked down our lives for "just two weeks" for every new disease that appeared we would never have a life. No, lockdowns and restrictions for two weeks were not justified, they were never justifiable, and the authorities should never have been given the benefit of the doubt when it comes to enacting such an insane and tyrannical policy.</p>
<p>That said, while I was against "stay at home orders" from the first time I heard of the idea, taking additional precautions may well be justified and is nothing to be ashamed about. After all, the disease does raise the risk of sickness by a magnitude comparable to a flu season. So if you wash your hands more often or refrain from being packed in with crowds indoors during rough flu seasons you should definitely do the same thing with this outbreak. Staying home or at least keeping your distance from people when you're sick, along with practicing basic hygiene, is always a good idea. Above all you should never cough on people when you're sick.</p>
<p>The same precautions we take against any communicable disease while still being able to go about all the activities of life unobstructed are justified; the "precautions" that involve suspending our lives out of fear are not.</p>

        <p>I don’t trust the governments reaction to it. I don’t like that they can close down small businesses and leave the giant businesses open. I think they use it to their advantage. I don’t like being forced to wear mask I think it should be a choice. But that doesn’t mean COVID is something to fuck around with. My teacher just died from it and my father in law was hospitalized with it. I wear a mask because I’m pregnant, and it doesn’t look like fun if you’re someone that it hits hard. I think you should be cautious, my beef is with being forced to be cautious by law and the government using it to their advantage.</p>

        <p>Definitely don’t be ashamed, but I think there are a substantial number of us who weren’t ever that concerned about the virus. I was seeing pseudo-scientific fearmongering about it on r/conspiracy in December/January with posts about body burning increasing sulfur oxide in the air and people in hazmat suits in a morgue... all of it fairly easily toppled by fairly facile investigation. Couple that with the numbers China was reporting being not so scary (setting aside reasonable skepticism of those numbers). </p>
<p>So I was already primed to be skeptical about how bad COVID was when things started getting bad in Italy (ie, when the rest of the world began taking it seriously). At that time, it seemed weird to me that surrounding Asian countries were doing ok, even though they should have been hit much sooner than Italy. I was also reminded of the China fearmongering when things like that Italian newspaper obituary section viral video came out. When I looked into the epidemiological models (I do modeling for a living, so I trust my judgement and understanding of them), especially those developed after Diamond Princess, it became clear the problem wasn’t so bad. Cultural differences lead to more rapid, deadly spread in Italy explained why they did “worse” than Asian countries who innately “flattened the curve.” I was also concerned about the lack of evidence-based approaches (such as lockdown) in the face of the virus, which was reaffirmed by Ioannidis’ first commentary article about the situation.</p>

        <p>Sure, we just didn't know at first.    It made sense to pause <em>briefly</em> and assess.   The problem was that people stopped assessing and started hiding and then attacking others who didn't want to hide.</p>
