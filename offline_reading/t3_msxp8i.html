    <strong>What a lovely day...</strong>
    <p><p>I went out to run several errands, and in each place, I somehow "forgot" to put on my face diaper. Yet, in no instance did anyone say a single word or play mask police with me. Which also meant that I didn't have to try to re-educate anyone or coddle anyone's fears.</p>
<p>I went to a plant nursery first. There, I saw lots of faceless individuals. I had several questions as I was searching for some suitable shrubbery to replace some things that were lost to our February freeze here in Texas. I chatted at length at a NORMAL conversational distance from the very kind and helpful garden employee, and not a word came up about my freely exposed face. Unfortunately, due to supply shortages, I left empty-handed... but I'll be back when they get a new shipment mid-week. It's one of my favorite nurseries and has been for a long time. They remain on my favorites list.</p>
<p>After a good time of plant hunting, I was hungry so I stopped off for some lunch. How forgetful I was... I forgot my face diaper again, silly me. Oh well, I'll just go in anyway. To my delight, there were absolutely no "Mask Required/Requested" signs anywhere, just a friendly reminder about social distancing. Cool, I hate people in my space anyway. I'm all for anti-social distancing... so I placed my order and filled my drink, and ate my food right there in the restaurant. No one said a single word to me. They will continue to get my business.</p>
<p>I had to pick up a few odds and ends at the El Cheapo store that was plastered with HUGE signs blaring "Masks Required". Oh well, mine broke. I'll just be a minute... got my stuff, went to the checkout, paid for everything... and no one said a thing to me.</p>
<p>For those who wish to support these sensible businesses in Dallas... here they are: Northaven Gardens, Redenta's Nursery, Taco Bueno and Dollar General.</p>
<p>Same story at the other 2 places I had to go... no rag, no complaints. It was a lovely day. ðŸ˜Š</p></p>

        <p>Let's add Advance Auto Parts and Auto Zone to the list. </p>
<p>I will start a thread to list "Smile Friendly" businesses where face diapers aren't forced, and others can add to the list to include other businesses and locations that welcome smiles and faces. These are businesses that deserve our support. I will also add Albertsons (at least the one in my neighborhood) to the list as well.</p>

        <p>Great news. A lot of the signs on the doors are really just for the government inspectors to placate them and send them on their way. I'm finding more and more people just don't give a shit about the mask mandates.</p>

        <p>I did encounter some little martinet yesterday at another nursery. It had been raining like hell, so I popped in for just a second... before the little $8 an hour goober immediately asked, "Where's your mask?" I said, "Sorry, I have a condition that precludes the use of a mask." He immediately replied, "Then you have to leave. There are NO exceptions. The CDC says that even vaccinated people have to wear a mask. We follow CDC guidelines here". I countered, "Oh, you mean the same CDC guidelines where we were advised by the CDC NOT to wear masks? Or that we only need to wear them for two weeks? Or that we reach herd immunity at 60%, or 70%, or 90% vaccine rate... or whatever it is THIS week? THAT CDC?"</p>
<p>He then threatened to call the police on me. I guess this thing is giving neat new powers to entry level chumps like that mouth breather.</p>
<p>That's ONE business I won't support. They kind of suck anyway, but I thought they might have what I was looking for. Guess I'll never know, and there are plenty of other smile friendly businesses where I can send my support.</p>

        <p>Yeah, everyone wants to imagine that Clay Jenkins has a hold on the city and Dallas is complying, but I haven't worn a mask downtown in 3 weeks. </p>
<p>It's a lot easier to get rid of the mask when you just stop carrying one with you every time you leave the house.</p>

        <p>Clay Jenkins gets smacked  by Greg Abbott every time he talks about implementing more strict rules for Dallas County than what Abbott has okayed for the rest of the state. Jenkins is a two-bit county judge, and even the County Commissioners put their collective foot down on him.</p>
<p>Do you realize that the City of Dallas is the ONLY SIGNIFICANT TOWN in Dallas County where you cannot physically visit and use a library? True. It's all "curbside" and by appointment. No more losing yourself in the racks of books, or visiting the genealogy department, or using the computers if you are a poor person trying to go online to access services or look for a job... or if you're a poor kid without the resources at home to do online schoolwork. Literally EVERY SURROUNDING TOWN has open access to libraries, even if the daily hours are a bit reduced. The resource is still there, everywhere else BUT Dallas.</p>
