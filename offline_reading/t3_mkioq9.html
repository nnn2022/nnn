        <p>Here‚Äôs another way to look at these ‚Äúprovisional‚Äù numbers:</p>
<p>The previous 5 year average for suicides was 46,437 so this year we saw a relative decrease of 1600 suicides (or a 3% drop). </p>
<p>I‚Äôm sure there were a bunch of very unhealthy older people who died of covid this year who would have committed suicide, so the suicide numbers are going to be pulled down a bit. I can guarantee the number of suicides of younger people is significantly higher. Ignore this for a second. </p>
<p>Importantly, the number of ‚Äúunintentional injuries‚Äù deaths dramatically increased from a 5 year average of 163,609.6 to 192,176, for a total 28,566 excess deaths, an increase of 17.5%. This number includes ‚Äúaccidental overdoses‚Äù which we would classify as ‚Äúdeaths of despair.‚Äù</p>
<p>So the alternative headline could read ‚Äúdeaths of despair dramatically increased in 2020.‚Äù</p>
<p>Or you can run the headline ‚Äúsuicides decreased in 2020.‚Äù It all depends on what you want the reader to believe. </p>
<p>Remember also these are ‚Äúprovisional‚Äù numbers. Reclassification of a small portion of these ‚Äúdeaths from accidental injury‚Äù as suicides would mean that suicides were indeed higher. The only thing that makes an ‚Äúaccidental injury‚Äù a suicide is intentionality, which can often be difficult to determine.</p>
