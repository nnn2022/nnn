        <p>They are, they are conflating it with background cases of myocarditis across the entire population... they also are saying that so far the amount of cases doesn't suggest the need to pause or rescind vaccine rollouts, its kind of really upsetting to be honest, literally injuring the young to save the old...</p>

        <p>Im sort of torn on the issue giving vaccine to kids. I know of cases where kids got covid and still were severly fatigued for months. Then again, my daughter had it a few weeks back. No real symptoms except some sneezing (during pollen season) and a little runny nose on and off.  The didnt infect anyone else either.</p>

        <p>I find it highly irresponsible - i mean just evolutionarily speaking we, through the vaccine are creating a monoculture of antibody response (the mrna vaccines I'm particularly picking on), to be honest, the most legitimate argument against gmo'd foods is monocultured crops, being of the same genetic line are susceptible to the same disease  that spreads like wildfire --- even if the vaccines have a level of effectiveness the mrna one in particular directs the body to the particular antibody to make --- highly worrisome in my perspective. </p>
<p>This doesn't even touch on the presumption that the vaccine may in fact be more harmful to that demographic than good (looking at large numbers) -- the real issue I take with all of this though is that we just don't really know yet, and have decided to jump in as a society without any hesitation, the least we could do is approach children in this respect with caution and care - not pressing this unless it becomes incredibly apparent that something terrible is happening to them you know?</p>

        <p>Mrna vaccines target the whole S-protein, not just one part. It doesnt only target the RBD so I dont really understand why you think its creating a monoculture of anti-bodies. </p>
<p>Also, beeing a few hundred million vaccinations in, it seems fairly benign to most of us. Its all about risk assesment and mitigation. I think would should decide for your self. However, I will only chose restaurants, venues, hotels, airlines that require vaccination going forward. Thats the best solution for everyone. Then the un-vaxxed can either chose establishments catering for their needs or start some in order to cater for the like minded.</p>
