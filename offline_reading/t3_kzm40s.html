        <p>Brain fog, difficulty concentrating, low energy. Vitamin D deficiency can do that, and isolation and being too sedentary for months aggravates everything. A lot of people feel worse in the winter than summer even if they don't have full blown Seasonal Affective Disorder. Even I notice a bit of a dip in the winter and I have good energy year-round. It's just better in July than January. Fuck cold weather.</p>

        <p>I dont think it is entirely propaganda. However, I think the amount of people actually experiencing these problems could/would be sensationalized by the media. Last time I had bronchitis, I had heavy breathing walking upstairs for a few weeks. Aftereffects are real with fucking everything. This just scares people.</p>

        <p>Yes. This happens with the fucking flu and colds too. I have a condition that causes all of that, and you can get it after ANY viral infection. Hundreds of thousands of ppl get it every year before covid. No one was being swabbed for flu last year,  but sure Jan, it's all covid, couldn't be something that has been happening for decades and is largely due to deconditioning during the illness for many ppl</p>

        <p>How about... people will seasonally get sick-
Because it’s our bodies’ jobs to purge themselves of toxins or heal seasonally: we’re triggered to do this by different factors. We will always get sick- sometimes in mild ways and sometimes in more severe ways depending on our toxic load or deficiency of minerals and vitamins. A test identifying an rna sequence in our bodies isn’t going to change this. Correlation can never lead to absolute causation.  Maybe their anxiety and all the other craziness in the world is causing our immune systems to
Go haywire. Social isolation lowers to bodies immune system. We are wired for social connection and 3 dimensional contact. So many peoples minds and bodies are suffering right now with this madness. Our bodies are born to heal and repair. That’s all they know how to do as long as we give them what they need.
This is the nature of our bodies and how the work.  There is
No need for debunking this.Read toxemia explained. Read the lost chapter in the history of biology. That will debunk this endless narrative- when people wake up and understand germ theory is false.</p>

        <p>I'd be super leary of accepting these statistics given the fact that most of the time it is how doctors.treat.female patients and not actually due to a lack of their legitimate health issues. I have a condition called pots, on average it takes 8 years to be diagnosed, it plagues more women then men exponentially but if a man goes in with the same symptoms he's exponentially more likely to get proper testing and a diagnosis within months instead of being dismissed for hysteria.</p>

<p>Not people who think their feelings trump facts.  And really that's what this is all about isn't it.  That feelings have pushed scientists to overlook facts.</p>
<p>I'll say it again.  Just because you had bad experiences with doctors stereotyping you doesn't mean that hypochondria is not more prevalent in women.  Please separate your feelings from fact.</p>

        <p>No you don't or you would have looked up the stats and conditions I mentioned and realized it's exactly what I said. But you couldn't be wrong and had to keep going. So who's feelings are involved now? You're a sad sad human really.  It isn't just my experience, like I fucking said, it's hundreds of thousands of women every year. Your "science" was a poorly done piece ages ago,when they still smoked in fuckin operating rooms with the last patients guts still on their gloves and gown, get over yourself and read research the Info provided instead of doubling down on your stupid, outdated, wrong information.  But hey, you said the word science so that makes you intelligent right? No one will argue with you if you say science while being proven wrong. What a sad, loser argument, or maybe you're just one of those ment who can't have a woman tell ypu something at this point, I'm leaning towards that.  Get some counseling or something, you've got a major judgement and personality problem at least. </p>
<p>For anyone reading, what I said is true of not just my condition but thousands of other conditions more women experience than men, statistically, and doctors are exponentially more likely to test men for those conditions than women despite the prevalence amongst the condition being almost entirely women. </p>
<p>Also if you're reading, don't be like this guy unless you want to die alone or at least not have the people at your bedside thankful you're finally gone</p>

        <p>By this logic we can easily say  "anyone who get sick 6 months after getting vaccinated is vaccine inured" couldn't we? </p>
<p>This isn't science it's crap. Correlation doesn't equal causation. For the next 3 years people will get any condition and the Dr will say, did you have covid? Oh then this must be from that." Despite the fact that say 200,000 ppl a year got the condition before covid existed, example POTS.  200,000 ppl a year get diagnosed with that in the USA every year before covid, but it's poorly known, since covid, anyone who develops POTS, it's instantly due to covid. What what about us poor fucks who got it before covid? Suddenly the only way to get it is covid then huh? Except that's not even close to true</p>
