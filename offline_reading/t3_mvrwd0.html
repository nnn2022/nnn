    <strong>I’ve noticed a trend in this sub</strong>
    <p><p>There’s a two different groups of people in this sub:</p>
<p>Then there’s the people who fear lockdowns and the shot and realize the “cure” is worse than the disease, and allll the lies for what they really are.</p>
<p>Then there’s the other people who fear lockdowns, hate this bullshit, but still get the shot because they don’t want to put “high risk groups at risk”. That’s fine, get your shot if you want it! But I’m wondering how you are only half-skeptical of this shit? Have you really not heard of how everything is labeled a covid death? Have you not heard of how PCR tests are garbage? Do people forget that the elderly, sick/immune-compromised and healthy have been naturally exposed to this virus for over a year, meaning most of us should have natural antibodies? Ever thought maybe NOT getting this shot won’t kill every “high risk” person around you or make them terribly ill? </p>
<p>Just curious on how some of you can see through the lockdown type stuff yet still believing “covid dangerous” narrative at the same time?</p></p>

        <p>My mom is a half skeptic and it's so annoying. She says she's against everything. She'll bitch about having to wear a mask, but then put one on every time she sees someone because "well they might be immunocompromised" and then state Covid is fake two minutes later. She'll also say "but it's an American flag mask so people know where I stand."  So annoying and this sub is split like that.</p>

        <p>This is my mom, too. Doesn’t agree with lockdowns. Doesn’t like wearing a mask. Thinks this entire thing is bullshit and has been a major skeptic from the start. And yet she still got vaccinated. And she still puts on a mask to “be respectful.”</p>

        <p>Full disclosure - I belong to group number one. I saw this for the bullshit it was back in February 2020 when our government wouldn't stop flights coming in from China 'cause "racism", but started punishing its own citizens with the masks, lockdowns, and store capacity limits. Not to mention the fuckery with BLM "peaceful protests"...</p>
<p>I think a lot of the second group only cared when it began to personally affect <em>them</em> (or their families) - by which time it was too late. The tyranny train had already left the station.</p>
<p>It's the old "<a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/files/2019-01/First%20They%20Came%20by%20Martin%20Niem%C3%B6ller_0.pdf?l6HOtWW1N8umC_ELxnQI6NpaAYbxRCJj=">first they came for the</a>...." thing all over again.</p>

        <p>I am also first group and agree, and good poem. But yea that makes sense. Like maybe they hopped in late and are sick of the tyranny but are still ingrained to be scared of covid. I just feel like “you’re halfway there! Don’t get the poison!” Like obv everyone should do what they want, but the people half-skeptical, come on guys</p>

        <p>This reads almost exactly like a Doomer troll post. I'll still engage in good faith.</p>
<p>My wife is in the camp you're describing. She says that because the PCR tests are shit, there likely isn't asymptomatic covid, which means that the covid that people do get is actually bad, but that it's much much more rare than made out to be. Please don't try and argue with me on this, I don't give a shit, I'm not going to right my spouse.</p>
<p>As for your other, implicit notion, that people are "half wrong", I'm fine with it, because people are not a monolith. Different people have different beliefs and opinions, and that's ok. None of us are at exactly the same point of knowledge. Knowledge isn't linear anyway. Demanding that people accept the things you believe, right now, is the very idea we're fighting against.</p>
<p>For instance I link a lot of people this new article from The Atlantic. It's the mainstream media perspective of masks and vaccine, so it's accessible to Doomers, but it's a step closer to the old normal in that it's calling out the dumb practice of outdoor mask mandates.</p>
<p>If you're going to be a purist about your beliefs, AND demand that others believe the same things, you're going to find yourself very alone very quickly in the face of the overwhelming power of the mainstream media and government. Being nitpicky about having the "right" beliefs is a turn off to would be allies.</p>
<p>Honestly for most of the normies I only try to push the idea that vaccinated should mean you don't have to wear a mask anywhere. Because that's about as far along the path as most of them can go right now.</p>

        <p>Covid is definitely not dangerous or deadly as people make it out to be. The percentage for my age group is extremely low.However for people above the age of 75 it’s a different narrative I hate lockdowns but if a stim shot is what it takes to end this I will go ahead with it. If you think about logically, let’s just say covid is a sacm. Why would the government shoot itself in the foot like that? . We’re more profitable to the government under normal circumstances i.e not on lockdown .So it is highly unlikely that this is all bogus. Is it overblown? Yeah . Is it fake fuck no. They government just don’t know how fo deal with because in a situation like this, no matter what they do It’ll backfire on them.</p>

<p>Your making the mistaken assumption that this is all about profit. This is about <em>power</em>.</p>
<p>Remember, once the government has taken away all of your freedoms, removed all of your basic human rights, and made you dependent on them for survival, they can (and will) take <em>everything</em> from you - at gunpoint.</p>
<p>What could be more profitable than that?</p>

        <p>First camp for sure. This is gonna be a long rant but i want to share my view as health worker (well ex worker) who was on the field.</p>
<p>Covid exist but it's nothing like they are trying to say it is. But it can be dangerous for immunocompromised people,elderly with natural weaker immune system,people with pre existant conditions and often more than 2. Keep in mind that these people are also at risk for every respiratory diseases but since 2020 we received the order to stop testing for influenza. (The governement statistics are public)</p>
<p>I saw the bullshit since the beginning as i worked at the hospital in the beginning of all this. I should have quit earlier but decided to stay to collect evidences that are very very disturbing such as governement private documents and footage and i had to find a good source to speak for me as i want to stay anonymous. I did and i trust them completely. The truth will come out eventually. 
I have witnessed what is really going on,if i get caught things can turn ugly for my family and i.</p>
<p>They made us sign things stating that we cannot speak about anything going on in these buildings and a good friend of mine had to do the same in elderly residence and she also quit and became an anonymous whistle blower. They forbide us to speak about it to our spouses even. This is some serious shit and a lot of money and serious threats are at it. </p>
<p>Some people could not take the pressure and unfortunately commited the irreperable and not speaking soon enough is something that many of us have to live with now (even writting this bring tears to my eyes). I'll never forgive myself because i keep having nightmares about the fact that if i have found these evidences earlier,more lives could have been saved. </p>
<p>I knew something very sinister was going on when superiors told me i wasn't allowed to perform any surgery for X numbers of days because of covid...I have every reason to believe that some people WANT cases and deaths. Don't blame your local politicians,they are only puppets.</p>
<p>All i can say is that far less people died of covid than what they pretend. Abuse,neglect,starvation,dehydration,removing essential medications,injecting more medication to accelerate deaths,intentionally infecting people are things that will come out one day as we have crystal clear evidence for this.</p>
<p>I will never encourage people to get vaccinated for covid. I let them decide for themselves but doctors push it because they get reward$. Even doctors who didn't push it got "convainced" and that's why you'll see many of them switching opinions. </p>
<p>Same with covid deaths (why do you think they put every patient from the same floor in covid deaths regardless of the real cause ?) . </p>
<p>Coroners have discovered what's going on too. They know people died of X,Y and Z reasons and not covid. They get silenced. </p>
<p>All of us who know the damn truth get silenced. All around the world it is the same thing ! Even regular citizens because they have pressure from their entourage,doctors,medias etc There's only one narrative that is acceptable these days and anyone with critical thinking knows this is not normal.
That's why many of them "fall for it" and get vaccinated. They aren't scared of the vaccine but they are scared of the multiple societal consequences of not getting it. </p>
<p>After a year of this many people are broken emotionally and have adopted a "if you can beat them join them" mentality. It's easy to call these people weak but it isn't as simple as that. They feel trapped ! To me the camp 2 you are talking about is people like this.</p>
<p>I never saw anyone getting the vaccine for others as it doesn't even stop the spread.</p>
<p>I know for a fact that doomers get their informations from mainstream medias (puppet governement funded) while accusing us of taking ours on facebook..These people are like stuck in a cult,scared of the invisible and blind in front of facts because  "insert media articles with stats". I advice anyone to seriously be careful around them. Especially if you have crucial informations.</p>

        <p>I wear a mask when it seems necessary. I social distance when it seems appropriate. If someone asks me about the vaccine i just say I'll wait to get it, i just want more information about it. Seems to be a winning formula.</p>
<p>I live in Florida, currently in Chicago. Florida seems more loose, which is nice. Walking down a street in Chicago and got glares from two people because i wasn't wearing a mask outside. Seemed bizarre to me, but whatever people are conditioned for is how they'll react. </p>
<p>Covid is dangerous to a certain demographic. I know two separate people that were 80+ with lung cancers that both had Covid, obviously super high risk, are doing fine, so my fear of it is very low. </p>
<p>The biggest problem with pandemic and everything in society is honestly that being skeptical of anything puts you on the other side of things. I remember being taught to be skeptical and ask questions about everything, use that info to form my own opinions, but that seems to be less true during this time. </p>
<p>Like "stranger danger." Everyone is taught this and everyone agrees to be skeptical of what you dont know. </p>
<p>But now if im skeptical of fauci im somehow a denier of the virus even being a thing. At the beginning he said no masks unless you showed signs of infection and now he is saying 2 masks even if you're vaccinated. This is where i started to break off and see it more as propaganda. Do i think it's as wide a conspiracy as some on this sub, no way, but there's definitely some truth to it, just as there is some truth to the people that are truly afraid of this virus.</p>

        <p>I'm getting my second Moderna shot next week. I find some of you people in this subreddit as hopeless. You are so beaten down by you governments that you can't accept good news.  You folks are as bad as the doomers, I call ya "reverse doomers". The 4th of July in America is going to be EPIC. Like Miley Cyrus's song, "Party In The USA".</p>

        <p>An experimental drug with no long term tested side effects with the human trial ending in 2023 is good news? My body my choice, id rather not be a test subject for unknown long term side effects. If all of that sounds like good news to you, good! I don’t understand “following science” blind like that, but you do you!</p>
