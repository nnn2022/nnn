        <p>Yup, same old racket.</p>
<p>“At the present writing, <strong>October 1976, a group of medical opportunists have taken upon 
themselves the dictatorial authority to declare the threat of a sweeping epidemic of SWINE FLU</strong> which they said was similar to or related to the 1918 epidemic of Spanish influenza 
which wiped out 20,000,000 people world-wide. This declaration was <strong>supposed to scare all the people into their vaccination centers to be shot full of experimental vaccine poisons,</strong>
while they, the promoters, <strong>raked in the profits.</strong> During the big polio vaccine drive, a spokesman for ParkeDavis one of the five drug houses making the vaccine stated "Our company will clear over $10,000,000 on Salk vaccine in 1955 " Before they were through 
they had fleeced the people of over $4 billion dollars on the Salk racket (See the chapter on POLIO CAUSED BY VACCINATION) </p>
<p><strong>Most of the people had their eyes opened during the polio vaccine fiasco</strong> so now when the <strong>same poison pushers</strong> started to beat their drums again for swine flu vaccine customers, they were smart enough to <strong>see through the hoax and refuse the shots,</strong> even though the scare-head <strong>propaganda slogans</strong> said <em>swine flu is contagious and you can die if you don’t get the shots.</em></p>
<p>However, the scare techniques and perhaps other inducements, worked on (the then acting) President Ford who has since been voted out of office—and none too soon. <strong>When the high pressure sales committee, Doctors Salk, Sabin, Sencer, Mathews, Cooper, etc marched into Ford's office in March (76) and told him to hand over $135,000,000 to support their private money making racket, he handed it over like a simple child</strong> without even bothering to ask them for a guarantee that their unproved vaccine would not kill the people—as it did in other vaccine drives—or that their claims were justified. </p>
<p>Their claims of safety, effectiveness and need have all been proved to be false during the past few weeks when <strong>the vaccine killed 113 people, nation wide, and paralyzed 75 in California alone.</strong> We do not have the reports from all 50 states, but if it is the same as in Calif, that would add up to 3,675 cases of paralysis. Many coroners have been given orders by the doctors not to give out the swine flu casualties. So, we don’t know all the facts yet, and we may never know unless we have a "Watergate" investigation.”</p>
<p><strong>“All the flu vaccine sales promises were lies—proved later by the deaths and disasters within 
a few hours after the shots.</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>insurance companies</strong> which had insured the doctors and vaccine makers down through 
the years <strong>balked at this obvious vaccine swindle game.</strong> We wonder why Ford couldn’t have taken a tip from these shrewd businessmen and also turned down the whole, questionable vaccine program. <strong>We wonder what inducements prompted Ford and Congress to let themselves be talked into financing not only the vaccine but paying the damage costs</strong> which could amount to billions of dollars judging by the large number of deaths and disasters already reported, plus those which have been hushed up by the vaccine promoters. </p>
<p><strong>The most common remark we hear on the streets today is, "IT’S THE BIGGEST RIP-OFF OF ALL TIME."</strong></p>
<p>The vaccine promoters and drug insurance companies, no doubt, <strong>remembered the multi-million dollar lawsuits following the devastating polio vaccine campaign of the 1950’s when the Salk, Sabin, and Cutter vaccines caused thousands of cases of polio, death, and 
other disasters.</strong> The law suits flooded the courts and the vaccine promoters and drug houses had to <strong>pay out damages amounting to many millions of dollars.</strong></p>
<p>The five pharmaceutical houses making the Salk vaccine were called the <strong>Rockefeller chain</strong> 
then, and it is the same ones now making the swine flu vaccine, with a few exceptions. The <strong>vaccine promoters wanted to dodge all financial loss—the cost of the vaccine and the damage suits, so they could make clear profit, while the taxpayers were saddled with both the payment of the vaccine and the damages,</strong> also. I doubt that the crime syndicate could run a more crooked racket than this government sponsored and financed caper, with all the profits siphoned off into the pockets of the medical and drug concerns. </p>
<p>If those <strong>smooth talking con-men</strong> had been holding a machine gun on Ford they couldn’t have done a quicker and easier job of robbing this simple man who didn’t even know enough to do a little investigating before <strong>dipping into the public till to finance a private money making scheme.</strong></p>
<p>Ford was not the only guilty one in this conspiracy against the people. Most of the members of Congress gave their supporting vote. </p>
<p><strong>Before leaving office Ford asked the taxpayers to give the Congressmen a substantial raise.</strong> We wonder if he wanted to reward them for their part in helping him support organized 
medical crime. </p>
<p>An AP news report in the Los Angeles Times (Dec. 3, 1976) with a headline: $129 MILLION FEDERAL RAISE PROPOSED, says in part: </p>
<p>"... Ford will put the exact rates of pay he thinks advisable into the budget submitted next month. Unless the House or Senate kills the proposals. (Are they likely to turn down a raise?) the members of the House and Senate will receive $57,500 annually compared to the 
current $44,600." </p>
<p>Are they worth it? Another report told us that most of our Congressmen are corporation lawyers with an eye to serving private interests. Their vote for giving $135,000,000 of tax 
money to support a private medical racket (swine flu vaccine) would indicate that they are indeed working for "outside interests", and not for the good of the people who hired them to their high positions. </p>
<p>The same AP report also says: "The commission (to raise salaries) made it clear that it hoped to link the raises to a commitment by the three branches of government to come up with a stricter code of conduct on outside income and financial disclosures." </p>
<p><strong>Does this mean that if they are given the big raise they must promise to tell the truth about 
what "outside interests" paid them extra to swing the "big deals" in their favor?</strong></p>
<p>Public officials like this should not be given any raise at all; they should be given a dismissal and a prison sentence, plus confiscating the bribes they have taken from "big business". </p>

        <p>Back then, we still had a media that kind of reported the truth.  Vaccine makers were liable for damages too.  </p>

        <p>And that is why you can't sue vaccine companies anymore.  Gotcha. But, can the CDC be sued?</p>
