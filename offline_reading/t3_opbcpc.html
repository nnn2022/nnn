    <strong>A model letter to send to MPs/Officials regarding rejecting vaccine passports</strong>
    <p><p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>Whilst sending letters to MPs regarding vaccine passports might not be effective, it is worth a shot.</p>
<p>I would also suggest we send them on mass to public health bodies/officials/staff, health and safety boards, etc.</p>
<p>Below is a model letter that I feel covers most of our points against them in a measured and reasonable way. Feel free to use and to send to your own MP/official/relative who endorses them.</p>
<p>It isn't perfect perfect, but I did my best. Feel free to suggest any edits that I could put in the post, or other points.</p>
<p>See you all on the protests on the 24th.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I am writing to you, my local MP, about an issue I feel strongly about.</p>
<p>I am aware there will be a vote in the House of Commons about the Government’s proposed use of ‘vaccine-only’ passports (which would not allow for a negative covid test or prior immunity to be accepted) within the UK, that is, as a separate issue from their use for international travel. I will be referring to the use of vaccine passports/covid certification within the UK as ‘internal’ or ‘domestic’ vaccine passports.</p>
<p>I would absolutely implore you to not vote for the mandatory use of vaccine passports domestically within the UK, for the reasons below:</p>
<p>1.We have been told by the NHS and the government that the covid 19 vaccines, whilst highly effective in preventing and reducing symptoms in the vaccinated, do not stop a vaccinated person from potentially spreading covid 19. Thus, there is little reason behind the idea that such internal vaccine passports would reduce the spread of COVID-19, nor that they would make large venues anymore ‘safe’ against the spread of COVID-19</p>
<p>Vaccine passports are a permit to spread the virus unwittingly. System vaccines do not protect the vaccinated from mucosal infection. This is the initial, most contagious phase of infection. Therefore, fully vaccinated individuals can contract, carry and spread the disease. Giving people a “passport” to spread the disease (while giving them a false notion they are NOT doing this) makes no sense from an epidemiological point of view.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li>It is highly unlikely that covid 19 will be eradicated from the UK and the world. Only one human disease in history has been eradicated, smallpox, and that took over 100 years after the vaccine for it was introduced.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, I feel that the best course of action regarding covid-19 would be to treat it as the endemic disease it is-focusing on vaccinating the vulnerable and developing treatments, rather than on the spread itself.</p>
<p>I feel that measures such as internal vaccine passports and border restrictions are not going to make any difference to a disease which we will never eradicate nor permanently control the spread of, at least not for a century or so.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li>The government has said that the reason behind them is to also encourage vaccination uptake. With all due respect to the government, vaccine uptake in the UK is one of the highest in the world. Over 85% of adults have had a first dose, and over 65% have had two. Over 60% of young people have had the first dose, and it has only been available for them for a few weeks, so many may simply have not found the time off work or such to get the vaccine.</li>
</ol>
<p>The question I would like posing to the government is as follows-what percentage of the UK population would need to be vaccinated before, if the internal vaccine passports are mandated and implemented, before the internal vaccine passports are no longer mandatory? When would the use of the internal vaccine passports be reviewed?</p>
<p>I certainly would not wish for internal vaccine passports to be a permanent feature of society long after the covid-19 situation is no longer a priority of public health.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li>Internal vaccine passports are fundamentally against human rights. A person has a right to access services and entertainment in their own country without being denied access on the basis that they have or have not had a medical treatment, which is what a vaccine is.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is thus entirely possible that internal vaccine passports are straight up illegal and that the government is acting outside of the law in mandating their use.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li>Internal vaccine passports are discriminatory against racial minorities and religious minorities, who are less likely to get the covid vaccine for a variety of reasons which should be respected.</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li>Internal vaccine passports would create a ‘check point’ society, where access to services within one’s own country is predicated a medical decision which should be a person’s own choice for their own medical reasons, not because they simply wish to go to a concert or nightclub.</li>
</ol>
<p>People have a right to bodily autonomy, and their human rights should not be restricted as a matter as to what choice they made about vaccination or any other medical procedure.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li>Internal vaccine passports are an example of extreme medical coercion. In proper medical practice, a person is not coerced or blackmailed into having a medical procedure such as vaccination, and all advice given to the person should be regarding the medical benefits. To do otherwise may be considered a case of medical harm, and is against the Nuremburg code, which was set up to prevent such situations.</li>
</ol>
<p>For instance, if I am ill with TB and a doctor tells me I need a course of antibiotics and afterwards, TB vaccination, they should explain why that would be beneficial for me from a medical standpoint, not ‘otherwise you will not be able to enter a nightclub, go to a concert, and potentially not pubs and cafes’.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is exactly what the government has done with the ‘vaccine only’ internal passports, for which I am appalled.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p></p>

<p>Cheers. Have added it to the point about the government saying the vaccine does not stop the spread.</p>
