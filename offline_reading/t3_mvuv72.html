    <strong>Does anyone work in an Ontario (Canada) hospital?</strong>
    <p><p>So yesterday my father was watching some news channel, which was aggressively reporting that “Ontario hospitals are overwhelmed”. I’ve long noticed the media only covers part of any issue.</p>
<p>I’m a nerd, and I just wanted to include this passage from BRAVE NEW WORLD REVISITED by Mr. Aldous Huxley, which I feel sums up my thoughts rather well: “In practice we are generally forced to choose between an unduly brief exposition and no exposition at all. Abbreviation is a necessary evil and the abbreviator's business is to make the best of a job which, though intrinsically bad, is still better than nothing. He must learn to simplify, but not to the point of falsification. He must learn to concentrate upon the essentials of a situation, but without ignor­ing too many of reality's qualifying side issues. In this way he may be able to tell, not indeed the whole truth (for the whole truth about almost any important sub­ject is incompatible with brevity), but considerably more than the dangerous quarter-truths and half-truths which have always been the current coin of thought.”</p>
<p>With that in mind, is there anyone one here with friends/relatives who work in Ontario (preferably Toronto) hospitals? Are they REALLY overwhelmed? What does “overwhelmed” even mean?</p></p>
