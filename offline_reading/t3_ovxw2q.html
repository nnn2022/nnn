    <strong>How Can Wal-Mart Legally Selectively Choose Which Group of its Employees Must be Vaccinated?</strong>
    <p><p>I know that companies can group employees for items like benefits, but the law is very specific that those practices must be non-discriminatory. For example, you can give benefits to employees that are full-time while legally leaving out part-time employees, but you can not base it on race, age, disability, etc. How then can Wal-Mart create two classes of employees based on a medical status? How is Wal-Mart legally able to require a vaccine in their corporate office, but then say the employees in our warehouses and stores are not required. If their concern was about COVID, shouldn't they make sure their store employees are vaccinated, since they are more likely to spread it to the general public?</p>
<p>Edit: essentially an unvaccinated person who works in the corporate office couldn't work in that office, but then could go work in a store with no problem? Seems to me there is a legal challenge that could be had here. Wal-Mart should require ALL or no employees to be vaccinated. They should not be allowed to discriminate against corporate employees because it is less convenient to require store employees to be vaccinated.</p></p>

        <p>Wal- Mart pays $hit wages to their store employees and warehouse workers.  Plus they have many Black and Hispanic employees (and that demographic have many people that are not vaccinated).  To top that off, they are having trouble finding workers for those jobs with the enhanced unemployment benefits.  So Walmart can look all PC by making their higher salaried employees have to be vaccinated.  They have more to lose if they lose their jobs for not complying.  But they can't afford to force their low paid workers to be vaccinated.  Because they would be more likely to just quit.</p>

        <p>True. Although making the corporate employees get it is evil, I was really glad to hear the hourly associates and store managers don’t have to. </p>
<p>I still won’t shop at Walmart but I hate to think of minimum wage workers having to choose between the vaccine and feeding their kids. </p>
<p>Those corporate employees are at least way more likely have savings, 401k etc and to be able to afford to quit and still be able to pay their bills while they look for a new job, or have the option of working from home.</p>

        <p>If WalMart requires all employees to vaccinate or be fired...soon there will be no one to stock the shelves of their stores for their shit wages. The management and corporate employees are higher paid and value their jobs more. So threatening them carries weight.</p>
<p>At least in the short-term, jobs that have a labor shortage will not see vaccine requirements because they can't fill the jobs as it is. There is no easy replacement if they lose someone for refusing the jab. Some companies can't afford to lose 1/3rd of their staff over this without significant production losses. However, there is enormous government and media pressure. So they have to balance it. And companies will force certain classes of employees to get it.</p>

        <p>I sincerely hope they ALL quit. Walmart is a parasitic company that pays their employees WAY below survival wages. The world would be better off without Walmart.</p>

        <p>I totally agree. They’re 100% evil, remember when they had a food drive for their own employees instead of, you know, just paying them enough to be able to afford food?</p>

        <p>Oh, I remember that. The food drive wasn't to help their employees. It directly benefited Walmart since they are also one of the world's largest grocery stores too.</p>

        <p>There’s a pilot shortage, but yet United &amp; Delta announced they will only be hiring vaxxed pilots. This gets around the obstacle of the pilot unions. As long as other airlines don’t hop on this trend, this might screw them over enough to seriously hurt them.</p>

        <p>I hope so. I will never fly with either of them again. If we really want to stop these mandates we should aggressively boycott EVERY company that does this, including Facebook and Google.</p>

        <p>That is my point though. They are creating two classes of employees based on medical status. If they are going to mandate vaccines for corporate employees because of COVID, I am arguing they must do the same for all employees. Employees are not allowed to create classes of employees based on discriminatory practices. I argue that vaccination is a medics status and therefore Walmart is creating classes of employees illegally.</p>
