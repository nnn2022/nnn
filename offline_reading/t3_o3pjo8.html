        <p>Yet in reality, I don't personally have that big a footprint.</p>
<p>I could be much more efficient if it was possible, but I don't have a choice but to use a gas engine, until an alternative is provided. I walk and bicycle more for exercise instead of taking the vehicle as it is good for my health, and saves on gas use.</p>
<p>With proper recycling, I'd be more than happy to do it, composting has been in my past and I've done that too, yet I must deal with packaging from corporations through no fault of my own - but I'm blamed?</p>
<p>Yes, I require a gallon of water each day to function, so what. I'll pee it back onto the ground, my urine has nitrogen in it that helps gardens grow.</p>
<p>With further options I could compost my poop, urine, toilet paper, toilet rolls, kitchen scraps, bones, etc with little to no impact on the sewer system. I could even switch to microfiber cloths to save money on toilet paper and further help the environment, (or a bidet).</p>
<p>I am all for efficiency and making the planet more green - but not at the expense of draconian measures that PUNISH the average Citizen,rather than EMPOWERING them to change, or PROVIDING them with viable options.</p>
<p>We have everything we need still on Planet Earth, and though it has a FINITE amount of resources, we haven't reached anywhere close to that yet. When I can grow so much food for myself in just a 12 x 12 foot area and some pots, and even a couple garbage cans (potatoes) and cant even eat it all cuz i get sick of it and have to give it away, don't talk to me about food shortages, overpopulation and all this other BS that could EASILY be solved whenever we want to.</p>

        <p>Ok I’ve heard so many conspiracy theories on this sub, So the government created a highly infectious harmless virus, and then released a vaccine as a form of population control? Why not just release a deadly virus? This all seems kind of stupid and doesn’t connect at all.</p>

        <p>The most obvious reason why not would be that you are never going to get universal infection of a respiratory virus but on the other hand through various social mechanisms, you have a much better chance at getting closer to the total population number since people are voluntarily dosing themselves.
I'm not saying I think a planned depopulation scheme is a likely scenario but it's interesting to think about.  I don't think you would be able to get buy-in by the number of people necessary to pull it off since it's so evil.</p>

        <p>I dunno is that the claim, where did you see it, and refer to us the source.</p>
<p>What we DO KNOW is that the World Economic Forum, the UN, the WHO, who are the "Build Back Better" Globalist crowd and Agenda2030 planners ar celebrating Covid19 as a 'unique opportunity to restructure and reshape our world' towards their goals.<br>
This is where the alleged 'conspiracy theories' come from, but when you investigate the goals of these organizations,and read the papers on their website, then you may understand.</p>
