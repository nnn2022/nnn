    <strong>To Those For Whom Opening Schools Is Classist and Racist</strong>
    <p><p>As someone who works with parents and is one... I think it is accurate to say that trauma is what children are experiencing when they are denied the ability to be a part of life. Kids now have full time online jobs going to school. In the stats that I've seen in my area, they are failing around 40% of their classes. Most are experiencing drastic reductions in their self estimation as, isolated, they believe that the reason that they are not succeeding at Do It By Yourself Covid School is because they are stupid. An ER nurse in my area related an unprecedented number of suicide attempts recently. Way more than "normal". I don't need a stat to know what I see in my own child, to hear other parents sharing the tears and hopelessness of their own. </p>
<p>For a disease for whom the majority of its damage is done to a very clearly delimited demographic, I wonder why children's lives are treated like a bargaining piece when there has never been a need for them to be bargained with. Targeted protection is a strategy advocated for by many many thousands of doctors, with some of the very best in the country and the world signing on to the Great Barrington Declaration. Sacrificing our own children was never necessary. The voice of Covid, Fauci himself, is now speaking up for kids to be allowed back in school. When will experts be expert enough to open the gates. I have a HUGE file of studies evidencing that schools being open do not significantly contribute to spread. When is science going to stop being a doctrine and start being a tool for life affirming decision making? </p>
<p>And how are the low income doing? The low paying jobs, for those privileged enough for even them, are largely often in person. When parents go to work, where are their kids? Maybe they are home alone, or one caring for their younger siblings, attempting to do school. Imagine having the privilege of the unhealthy infrastructure needed to do online schooling, passing the days bathed in screen light. If the children are in care, then, how is it OK for children to gather for care but not for schooling? Childcare workers are more expendable than teachers, by the promoted reasoning? BTW childcare pays very very poorly. Nothing like telling people that, because they are low income, they and their children can just carry the terrible alarming deadly risk for everyone else. I know parents who have had to quit their jobs in order to care for their children. Many parents now get to act like unpaid paraprofessionals, jail wardens effectively, for their own children, attempting to help them fit in the virtual education peghole that is inhumanly difficult to fit. This is not to save lives. The children were never killing people, but this locking them up to play out the prevention of the dark fantasy of grandma's death is harming them, deeply, and sometimes mortally. </p>
<p>Privilege is sitting secure in your own home, with your online job, and your online activism suggesting for others to sit by themselves, like you do, as their moral duty. Meanwhile the low income continue to circulate, working, doing the things that are still allowed to be done, and maybe need to be done, to make the unwieldy proposition of a populace wrapped in cloth and 4 walls even temporarily doable. As evictions for nonpayment of rent become once again legal, there are less and less of those who have the "privilege" of being Stay Homed. If you want to know what privilege is, look to our leaders whose children attend in person schools while daddy governor denies the other children the same. If they really thought it best for schools to stay closed, why not keep their own kids home? </p>
<p>Privilege is living a healthy and worthwhile life, with people whose company you choose, doing the work you've given yourself to, and a breath of fresh air filling your lungs. Arrogant assholery is denying others even their best attempt at such.</p>
<p>When you mislabel adherence to the unhealthy upside down world that we see here as a privilege, it is like kneeling in the pew to give reverence to one fragrant and mountainous pile of It. This world in which children's lives don't matter, and are now effectively being sacrificed on the eat crap altar for the new religion of Covid Lives Matter More, is a world in which parents may be the only saving prayer for the lives of the most tender, vulnerable, and beloved amongst us. </p>
<p>I know what it is to give up my life for another. My sacrifice is by way of a love that values life. I don't make people live as though they are not people at all, and call that a life saved. I have children, and I know what it is to nourish them towards life's calling. Life is for up. Life is for opening. Life is not for hiding under masks and darkening behind doors. Life is not for refusing ourselves to each other. A parent's sacrifice is the true sacrifice. A parent's sacrifice begins with birth, a miraculous bringing to life. Bringing To Life! Where I am concerned, if the sacrifices you are asked to make do not bring to life, if they are not flush with an unbetrayable and self transcending heartening of love, like what I have in me for my child, then what you are proposing is a sacrifice that neither myself, nor my child, will partake of!</p></p>

        <p>It's part of the plan.
 The question to you and the rest of the parents is. Where do you draw the line? </p>
<p>Till they strip you away from your children (already happening)?
Till they come in and send you to the camps (happened in Australia &amp; China)? 
Till they put you in the oven (happened to ethnic minorities all over)? 
Where is this special red line everyone loves to talk about?</p>

        <p>Public schools have been shit since at least the 90’s in my experience. I’m glad they’re shit down.</p>
<p>Conversely, I’m appalled that not many parents are willing to start home school associations to replace public indoctrination camps.</p>

        <p>I hate school so much now. I made a post on it but basically my day is spent staring at a computer screen alone. I hang out with friends and chat with people i know on google meets but that’s not the same as in person with no masks. I think as an adult I would literally rather homeschool my kids than send them to public school. Some of the teachers are great but most are lazy and won’t help you if you need it, especially if you’re older because “you should know by now” or “you have a computer in front of you”.  I want to drop out and if I had a job with more hours I would  for the year.</p>

        <p>I would totally support my 15 year old to do anything that we could do that would work better. He didn't go to school until 3 years ago, so he's got an idea that he needs to get all of the learning now. I would rather have him work, ride bike, and have illegal hang outs with other teens than sit in front of the computer all day trying to make computer school work. I was thinking that if I were in this scenario I would try to find a place that does things that I want to do and intern, in person. Even if it were a farm, or handyman, or the newspaper, I was trying to think what opportunities are out there. I don't think you really need to go to school. You could get your GED. You could build a homeschool portfolio and even get into many colleges in the future without doing time in high school. Of course, I wouldn't go to virtual college myself right now. I'm not really religious, but, having seen that often churches are places where people will get together, I'd probably take to hanging out there. I'm sorry that it is a pretty idiotic situation right now. It will pass. A lot of us are really working on it. We don't accept what they are serving us for dinner, and we're never going to forget what real food tastes like. We're never going to adjust our tastes and desire cardboard. Hold on, and don't let anyone tell you that you don't know what is good.</p>

        <p>i am totally opposed to compulsory state schools, which are little more than full time indoctrination and 'socialization' day camps. they infringe on the 'protected' right of free association and fails on that alone. </p>
<p>free-market, local and voluntary 1 room mixed age school houses are the best, let teachers compete  which will raise quality and lower the price. sell off the state buildings to locally owned educational co-ops and let the people involved have at it.</p>
<p>the state needs to be put out of the 'education' business, it has no rightful claim to 'educating' anyone, it does so at gunpoint.</p>
