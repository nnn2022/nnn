    <strong>Man living in my house for 48 hours constant contact had covid and none of us knew it.</strong>
    <p><p>My best friend has a company that does long haul moving. </p>
<p>They use my house as base camp on Florida jobs, it’s free and it’s nice to see a friend who lives about two thousand miles away every so often. </p>
<p>He had a employee who contracted covid while here in Florida. (He didn’t know until his return to NY) during his time here we </p>
<p>Shared joints, shared drinks. </p>
<p>Went to a massless baseball game
Went to a bar maskless </p>
<p>Drove around in my tiny BMW 
And slept near each other. </p>
<p>None of my friends or family contracted covid and I currently have no antibodies. </p>
<p>I was just recently hit by a car and got blood work. (Funny how I was more likely to get hit by a car than catch covid) but I digress, </p>
<p>The difference is this to me atleast. </p>
<p>Im a healthy man, I take vitamins I bathe and brush my teeth often, I have a good diet. </p>
<p>The guy who caught covid? Didn’t bathe once while at my house or brush his teeth and I only saw him eat greasy foods. </p>
<p>His immune system obviously weak took covid in. (He never got sick mind you, just a cold really) </p>
<p>I have nothing else to say just needed to share.</p></p>

        <p>How do they know it was covid? Has it finally been isolated in a lab, proving it exists or did they rely on a pcr test?</p>

        <p>You think someone who doesn’t brush their teeth enough to have their gums and teeth covered in plaque doesn’t have an adverse effect? Do you know how much bacteria grows in your mouth daily? Brushing your teeth isn’t for beauty. (Manufactures and companies will have you believe that) It’s for getting rid bacteria. Humans and animals have cleaned their teeth forever, in modern day we just use a minty paste.</p>
<p>You could brush your teeth with water and some sticks to chew on. </p>
<p>You could clean your teeth with some leaves and pick and scrape off the garbage. You can disinfect your tongue with lemon water. There are other ways that humans used. </p>
<p>Your mouth is a Petri dish for bacteria you breathe in.</p>

        <p>I’ve read how there are many cases in which 1 person in a household contracted COVID, and no one else in that same household has. Which means it’s actually pretty hard to catch the virus, and that the window to actually spread it, is very narrow. </p>
<p>This has happened in my household as well. My brother contracted it, had a cough, and slight fever for a few days. Him and my mom(she’s in her 60s) are together all the time. She never caught the virus(tested negative for antibodies). My brother tested positive for antibodies shortly after. A year later he tested for antibodies, still has them</p>

        <p>I had the same experience with my father, except we knew he had it. I wasn't going to let a virus with a high survival rate change how I lived inside the house. I didn't change a single thing and neither me or my masked mother tested positive.</p>
