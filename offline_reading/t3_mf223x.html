    <strong>I went into a holistic shop that didn't require masks, and I literally almost cried.</strong>
    <p><p>How ridiculous, right? </p>
<p>Yesterday I went hiking and afterwards stopped by a holistic shop that was next to the trail. My friend asked the owner "do you require masks?" And he said "it is your choice, my friend!" </p>
<p>Once I walked in and had a minute to myself, I literally almost got emotional. It was such a freeing feeling. I have not been in a store that didn't require masks in over a year. It almost felt foreign to me. </p>
<p>I know some people have enough balls to go maskless in stores on a daily basis, but I'm still too scared to do it in fear that I will get videotaped and blasted on the internet. Or have the police called and have me escorted from the store. </p>
<p>It made me feel so good, but sad at the same time, that this is what it has come to? Me literally almost being in tears over not being forced to wear a fucking cloth over my face. </p>
<p>Another amazing part of this was the owner getting close to me, showing me how to use Chakra bowls, etc. He wasn't AFRAID of getting close to me. He also didn't have a mask on. He was so friendly and welcoming. I was able to see him smile.</p>
<p>Anyways, I just wanted to share my experience. I've been extremely depressed over this covid hysteria. I've been stuck in my house, unable to do anything fun and it just felt amazing to have normalcy for the first time in over a year.</p></p>

        <p>There is no reason a sign should be the thing dictating what you can and can't do. Just walk into every store without a mask. We'll never get passed this if a piece of virtue signalling cardboard is all it takes to make you muzzle up.</p>

        <p>You're right. It sounds so fucking ridiculous but it's true. Most workers don't get paid enough to deal with anyone not complying. Police are being defunded, I doubt most of them give a shit about enforcing it. I need to grow a pair and just fucking do it.</p>

        <p>You know what I did the first time I didn't wear a mask? I imagined a bubble shield around me and said to myself : No one will harrass me, descriminate me or make me feel bad about not having a mask. No one will come to me with mask enforcement bullshit. It worked!
I think I am a hippie now too üòÅ (also been meditating to feel more calm among all this fearmongering). Only one time I was given a mask at a shop door, but I politely said, I cannot wear one, and the person was like Oh sure , fine!</p>
<p>Trust yourself! Put your head up and walk straight!! I'm only 5'1 and I was a bit apreensive on the first time... No one I know really refuses to wear one, it feels lonely to be the only one against this... But I don't really care right now. I'm short but fierce. My piercing eyes says everything üòÇ I am not wearing a mask anymore!</p>

        <p>I'm Jewish and here's why I think it's a fair comparison: In Nazi Germany Jews were wrongfully blamed for society's problems via media propaganda. This turned the public against Jews.</p>
<p>Today mainstream media wrongfully blames the unmasked for Covid-19 deaths. This has turned the public against those who actually follow the science on masks and lockdowns.</p>
<p>Most scientific studies found little to no evidence for the effectiveness of cloth face masks in the general population: <a href="https://swprs.org/face-masks-evidence/">https://swprs.org/face-masks-evidence</a></p>
<p>To save lives we need to trust the science and focus on what actually works.</p>

        <p>If it helps, I always walk in without one but have one in my pocket so I can claim I forgot if asked. I‚Äôve never once had a civilian record or bother me before in over a year. A few employees have asked and I always comply so as not to make their lives harder since they likely don‚Äôt give af and are required to enforce it. It‚Äôs not scary</p>

        <p>Thank you. I just used your links and watched a video explaining how taking the vaccine will make your body only notice the variant that it was made for, and will essentially ignore all other covid variants and not even allow natural immunity to attack it since it‚Äôs not the same exact form as the vaccine. It makes sense why you can‚Äôt remove your mask after getting the vacccine. You‚Äôre even more susceptible to every other variant because your natural immunity wont work properly to attack those. If this is true then in the next year people who had the vaccine are going to have a lot of health complications with future covid variations. Maybe the governments want to get more people injected before they notice. They‚Äôll either be reliant on pharmaceuticals in the form of boosters several times a year or the world leaders can decide the World population is too large and just let a few variations slip in.</p>

        <p>That's not true at all sweetie. Vaccines help produce antibodies but don't weaken immunity. A fully vaccinated person has a robust immune system.</p>

        <p>This week our governor in Arizona announced the mask mandate would not be enforced here anymore. Businesses could chose if they want to enforce masks or not. Cops would no longer show up to shut down a business if they aren‚Äôt requiring masks. All the country western bars immediately posted that they would be open, no masks required and dancing would be resumed. My friends &amp; I went to one of those bars last night and I have to say it was amazing to be completely back to normal, the place was packed, everyone having a great time, socializing and dancing, it almost brought tears to my eyes. I forgot how good freedom feels.</p>

<p>I swear, there is a bizarre hostility in demanding mask-wearing, so it feels like the "dancing resumed" is almost linked with the status of wearing masks.  </p>
<p>As if somehow people are happier without masks.  Go figure.</p>

        <p>That logic is flawed. We have speed limits to keep people safe on the roads. Should freedom mean no rules and everyone does what they want? Rules should be agreed upon by the majority, which sucks if you like not wearing a mask or speeding. Both can hurt people, whether that was your intention or not.</p>

        <p>OP, you are fine.</p>
<p>One thing that this sub often misses is that people will do something out of politeness, civility. (Some may need to look these words up)</p>
<p>It does not need to be fear.  You may choose to wear a mask because you know it will make others uncomfortable and you don't want to do that.  That's a valid response.  It's also valid to be pleased when you find that someone is not offended. </p>
<p>I have long said that I wear a mask for the same reason I wear trousers.  Many people are uncomfortable if you don't. </p>
<p>I'm not saying you should wear a mask because it's a rule.  I'm not saying to wear it because it's expected.  I'm saying it's your choice, and choosing civility is not wrong.</p>

<p>Boy howdy, I wouldn't.</p>
<p>If it were socially acceptable, I would be a bulk-size tube of Vaseline away from running almost completely nude.</p>
<p>Sure, I need shoes because I need the protection for my feet, and a bra because I'm a woman and running is just better if the girls aren't bouncing all over the place, but if it's hot, and I can get away with wearing as little as possible, that's what I'd god damned do.</p>

        <p>Definitely make sure you go back and support those places. I have found a few around me, it‚Äôs so strange at first, you feel almost apprehensive even though none of the employees have masks on, you feel like you‚Äôre doing something wrong. I went to a new welding supply shop, of all places, and I had my mask on, but after I left I realized that nobody else was wearing one. I made an excuse to go back the next day and buy something else, just so I could enjoy the feeling of being maskless. They were super friendly too!</p>

        <p>Where I buy mine, it's not really a health store.  It's just a small Mom &amp; Pop grocery chain in my local area.  I have no idea what the store owner's thought is on this behavior.  It's just the blue state teens they hired to cashier who just auto-assume if you like breathing and smiles that you must be an evil Trump supporter and a racist or whatever.</p>
<p>Just as last summer was turning to fall, I went in there to just pick up my usual gallon and 1/2 for the week and the physical activity and the cooler air triggered my asthma just right by the time I got to the registers I needed to pull down my gaiter and breath.  The cashier who was ringing me up was just fine, it was the one an entire lane away who just started yelling at me to pull up my mask.  I had no breath to answer her, so I just help up my medical alert bracelet.  She started yelling about how I had no business being out during a pandemic.  So yeah - the anxiety and embarrassment just made my asthma worse.  All I wanted to do was get to my car and take my inhaler.  If they weren't the only store in town that sold raw milk I'd probably never go there again.</p>
<p>I think you're right about the counterculture, though one of my formerly fav AIP authors is all pro-covid vax, so who knows.  (AIP Diet is basically an attempt to put autoimmune diseases into remission through diet.  People have a lot of success with it.  Seeing as it's not trying to solve through a pill, it should be counterculture.  I was horrified when she started podcasting about the "science" of the experimental vaccines. )</p>

        <p>Situations are going to be getting a LOT more uncomfortable thanks to so many people treating it this way.</p>
<p>I said it in the beginning, that complying to the mask BS would lead to opening the conversation about "mandatory vaccinations." At that point, everyone told me "bro you're crazy. There's not even going to be a vaccine for at LEAST 2 or 3 years anyway, even if they rush it... those things take so long to develop. Even then I don't think it'll happen."</p>
<p>Aaaaand here we are.</p>
<p>So, now that society is softly, slowly consenting to mandatory vaccines, what's next? When will the situation which is imposed upon you everywhere, at all times, be uncomfortable enough for you to say "enough is enough"? Genuine question, not rhetorical. Some people said that they would draw the line at mandatory vaccines, but that they were fine with masks. I'm eagerly watching those people this year, to see how long they last before caving into that just the way they did with the masks last year.</p>
<p>We are frogs in a pot.</p>

        <p>I walked into a petrol station shop yesterday without a mask and it was the first day this year where it‚Äôs been warm enough to just wear a t-shirt outdoors. The combination of the two just felt so uplifting and summery and freeing, so I totally know what you mean.</p>
<p>It was also helped by most of the other people in there being maskless too. And the guy behind the counter having a friendly interaction with me.</p>

        <p>Thank you for sharing.  This is so familiar to me. It's how I felt at the world wide demonstration last week. HUgging people and shaking hands maskless and not being looked like I am crazy is so refreshing! Yesterday I was treated very poorly by an employee for not wearing  mask. It stunk. I wanted to say. If rolled in here in a wheel chair and you said " sorry, we only let walking customers shop here", it would be the same as the way you just treated me. It's not fair. People don't understand how their discriminatory behavior is affecting other people as well as themselves. The toxic behavior has to stop. I would shop only at places that don't require a mask if I could. People are being treated as if they're  a disease before they're are a human being. I'm a white woman for for the first time in my life I think I know a little about how it feels. to be a person of color. The looks I get from everyone are baffling to me. It's like I have three heads and I always the ONLY one without a mask. My daughter said, "mommy people are looking at me weird". This is the hardest. I ask her if she wants to wear one to prevent the people from looking at her this way. She says, no. I don't want to wear one. My heart breaks for her, however I'm so proud of her. I try to tell her it's not okay for people to treat others differently based on their  health care choices. She is so awake and aware. She has eyes to see and I'm so proud of her for being brave.  I just feel horrible that in only one year we have done so much damage. We have created the image that people are a disease before they're human beings.  Your spirit connected with the humanity of how you felt. Your soul cried for the righteousness of this experience.  I'm so glad you had it and shared it with us.  Keep going out! You are exempt from wearing a mask because it is your human right to breathe oxygen!</p>

        <p>It's quite easy now for me to wander into a shop without a mask. If they challenge me and ask me to leave, I'm polite and leave or I just wear a mask if I really want to shop there. If they ask why, I give the honest reason, in a friendly and personable way. Some shopkeepers agree with me and lament that they don't want to make other customers feel unsafe. Some don't agree but let me come in without one anyway. That's how it should be.</p>
<p>I find big corporate chains are the hardest to navigate as the people working there can't set their own policies and fear their manager... it's in those places that I get negative responses, even being polite and non-confrontational. So I just don't shop at corporate chains where I can and live a more fulfilling life because of it.</p>

        <p>There was a "freedom" gathering at an outdoor park recently that people without masks had signs for free hugs and "show your beautiful face" and I went there and sat without a mask next to them while hundreds of people walk by masked outside wondering what was going on. I almost cried and just sat there thinking hard but also trying to enjoy it. It was a VERY profound moment moment to me and I could really feel how much things have changed for the worse.</p>

        <p>Since moving out of the horrible state that is New Mexico and making a massive career change, I get to be openly conservative and anti-mask here, even at work. I have to wear a mask at work due to company policy, but I can voice my opinion without fear of being fired. It is amazing.

        <p>It‚Äôs a damn shame that people look at you with pure hatred in their eyes, for not wearing a mask . I never wear one unless I am forced to do so . You can clearly see that I have no coughing , fever etc ., so why should it bother a person with a mask on ? I will not conform to a ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù, and do what everyone else does . I will not get the vaccine because I do not know what‚Äôs in it . No cure for cancer or AIDS, etc ., but a vaccine was readily available in about a year ?! How about no thank you ! Wearing a mask is for followers of the fake news that puts fear in people who are sheeples .</p>

        <p>I'm in the same boat as you. I live in a state that has had a mask mandate since July 10 and I've avoided going into stores and restaurants since then for fear of being mask-shamed. A certain local Mexican restaurant I frequent went along with the mask stuff at first, but over time, I guess they just stopped caring. Friday evening, I went there for the first time since early July after getting encouragement from my parents that they stopped wearing a mask there and no one cared. Well, no one said anything to me about being maskless and I saw several others walk in not wearing one either (although they weren't the majority), and nothing happened to them. It was a joyous moment for me finally going back to a lively place after so many months of uncertainty about how this place would treat maskless people.</p>

        <p>I'd support that shop, even if I didn't really have a need to (which is kinda my view on that whole niche anyway). People that stand up against mainstream are my go-to the last year, I actively try and support those who don't enforce, and more so, disregard policy.</p>
<p>These places will always be preferred over anywhere else, just based on response to this madness. It's literally the best thing we can do, if they can stand up, and deal with the BS, it's our job to support them.</p>

        <p>Well how are we supposed to know who agrees with us or not outside of this sub? So we can decide who we want to kill or not. We don't. We care about freedom for all. If you wanna stay home, stay home. If you want to wear a mask, do so. We're just not forcing things on people. And you might be thinking "what about the families that live with grandparents"? And that's a good point. I say those families, along with everyone else who's elderly and/or at risk, should have received help from the government so they could isolate as they needed. That's right, a conservative like me is supporting a form of socialism. Wanna know why? Because paying for that with our taxes would be MUCH less harmful than locking down the entire world, making normal life a thing of the past, and completely destroying the economy and causing widespread famine. Along with all that, our taxes are still being used for "covid relief" which is actually a bunch of democrat pet projects instead of helping Americans with covid.</p>
<p>The wrong approach has been taken here, causing irreparable damage to the world but you feel the need to defend it out of tribalism. The hysteria may currently be strong, but one day when the smoke clears you'll probably realize the destruction you've supported. </p>
<p>People like us on NNN are not your enemy.</p>

        <p>As someone who is high risk, you are my direct enemy. Anti maskers are fortunately sparse in my area, but nothing frustrates me as much as someone who knowingly puts others lives at risk in exchange for the "freedom" not wearing a mask provides. </p>
<p>If I come into contact with someone without a mask, even if I have one on, I have a higher chance of infection. It is impossible for us high risk individuals to completely exempt ourselves from society, and you're right, the government has not done its job in helping us, however that does not mean you can say fuck it and not wear a mask cause its "not your responsibility." </p>
<p>Frankly, is you not wearing a mask when you're in the Safeway really worth more than the lives of those around you? Guess so. I hope all you understand you're literally killing people with your bullshit. Freedom. Fucking hell. When did this become about freedom in your heads. So crazy.</p>

        <p>This became about freedom in our heads when it began to seem like it would never end.</p>
<p>All of this started with "15 days to slow the spread". The original goal was to prevent hospitals from being overrun. Then it became about testing. Now it's that we need enough of the population vaccinated. </p>
<p>Fauci for a while was saying we need at least 60-70% of the population vaccinated until we can return to normal. Lately he's been upping the number. 75-80%, 80% and up. Then he admitted in a phone interview that he had intentionally told us lower numbers than the truth, because he was worried about vaccine hesitancy. He also lied telling us "there's no reason to be walking around with masks" in March, even though he knew we were apparently supposed to. He apparently wanted the Healthcare workers to have them so he told us they're useless. This man doesn't care about us or about telling the truth. </p>
<p>What do you think he'll do when 70-80% of people get vaccinated? Because it's pretty obvious to me. He'll blame the last remaining people who refuse to get the vaccine. They'll be the reason we still can't get back to normal. There's always a scapegoat.</p>
<p>And why would there be a motivation to keep life like this as long as possible? Well there's 3 words for you, New World Order. The elite have a plan for us. They want us to "own nothing and be happy." (legit quote from a video by World Economic Forum about the NWO)</p>
<p>Everytime a small business shuts down, it's one less bit of competition for a company like Amazon. Do you know how much Amazon and Bezos have profited since all this started? You'd be insane to think they don't love what's going on.</p>
<p>I also want to bring up the blatant difference in how protests were handled. People that protested their businesses being forcefully shutdown were slandered by the media. They were called white supremacists. They were accused of causing covid superspreaders. Just because they wanted to generate income, feed their family. But the massive BLM protests? With tens of thousands of people crammed together on a street, many without masks? Sharing a champagne bottle when Biden was elected? Well none of that was an issue. Because BLM funneled money into the DNC.</p>
<p>I'd also like to bring up the many absurdities in daily life. Why is it so important people wear a mask while walking to the restaurant table, but once they're there everyone's in the clear? And why the hell are planes still serving food and water? If this was such a deadly pandemic, shouldn't flights be controlled to only be a certain amount of time where they don't need to let people remove their masks to consume? Why is the airline letting so many people get murdered?!?! It's VERY important you wear your mask while you get on the plane, you don't wanna kill people do you? But once the attendant brings food over, covid knows to stay out. Do you not realize how ridiculous this is?! </p>
<p>This is long now so this is my last point: The PCR tests are a complete joke. Elon Musk had 2 tests come back positive and two negative. A singer had each nostril test differently. And at one point, a piece of fruit tested positive. Look these stories up, they happened. These PCR tests are completely unreliable and made many false positives that the media used to fear monger about all the "cases" we should be worrying about.</p>
<p>Sars-cov-2 is a real virus, but it's been exaggerated like fucking crazy, and our response has not been worth the damage. This is what people mean when they say covid is a hoax. Our reaction to it is a hoax.</p>
<p>You're still here after all these months, even after passing by so many terrifying human faces, and you're still alive. Chances are you've got it by now and don't need to stay terrified. You do you, though. I'm just sick of hypochondria being forced on EVERYBODY.</p>

        <p>Take a deep breath and think about this. It's a fucking virus. An anti-masker is not your enemy, and they will not kill you - COVID will. How many people have you unknowingly killed because you passed on an illness that was nothing to your immune system but was too much for theirs? And even further, there is no way to completely avoid getting COVID short of staying at home 24-7, which just isn't feasible. I've known plenty of folks who did everything right and were far more cautious than I've been, and they still got it, because a virus is going to do what it's good at: infect people. I get that this is a scary and frustrating time, but you need to be rational.</p>

        <p>Anti maskers have a higher chance of transmitting covid. If I'm near an anti masker and I get covid because they aren't wearing a mask, and I die, its literally their fault and could have been prevented. Simply by covering their face.</p>

        <p>No, they do not. Unless you and everyone you around is wearing an N-95 mask, a simple cloth or paper mask is not going to decrease your chances of getting COVID. Also, just because someone is not wearing a mask doesn't mean they're making a moral statement. They may have simply forgotten. Finally: unless you are staying at home 24-7, you cannot avoid the risk of getting COVID, and thus it would be your own fault for choosing to engage in risky activities.</p>

        <p>Even non n-95 masks are proven to reduce transmission, though obviously official masks are way better. Frankly after a whole year of the mask mandate if you have "forgotten to wear a mask", you're lying. </p>
<p>I stay at home unless its necessary for me to go out. When I go out i hope everyone around me is wearing a mask and keep my distance. Are you trying to argue to me that masks don't work? They do. If everyone wears them, risk of transmission is super low. What don't you get about that?</p>

        <p>But who is not wearing them? This anti-mask bogeyman you've created doesn't actually exist, per multiple polls; most Americans wear them in public places. Again, though: masks are not foolproof. Nothing is short of staying home 24-7. And if you decide to leave your home, you accept the risk that you might catch COVID. I noticed you conveniently sidestepped my other point, which is that by your own definition you yourself are a murderer and at fault for thousands of people's deaths, because we pass germs and diseases all the time that don't hurt us but kill others.</p>

        <p>Traffic lights are protections in place to reduce car crashes and such. But they're not foolproof! Every time you drive you're a murderer!</p>
<p>Frankly you're making a non point. Masks are highly effective at reducing transmission so this whole "if you go outside with a mask on you're a killer" bullshit is stupid. And unrelated since I never said no one should be able to leave their houses lol. Obviously that would be impossible. However one would take the precautions necessary to reduce transmission as much as possible. </p>
<p>I have seen people without masks in public who refuse to wear them when asked, I have also seen posts in THIS SUB of people tearing up because they weren't required to wear a mask somewhere lmao. I see people with MESH MASKS. It's not entirely some "boogeyman"! But we can all make stuff up too.</p>

        <p>Yeah . . . unfortunately that example is not the clever response you thought it was, sorry. If I crash my car and it kills someone, we know that only the driver in my specific car killed that person; there's no way it could have been hundreds or even thousands of other potential suspects. With a disease like COVID, you have absolutely no way of knowing who infected you, unless you're only interacting with a finite number of people (and thus avoiding any place where large groups of people go in and out). That's why my example still holds - you've likely infected thousands of people in your lifetime, and for many of those folks, that infection may have been life-destroying. So by your own definition, yes, you are a murderer. That logic is ridiculous, of course, but it's exactly the conclusion that your rhetoric must arrive at.</p>
<p>And . . . it literally is a bogeyman. Your anecdotes are just that - anecdotes. For every story you have about those reckless anti-maskers, I could give you one about my friends who have lived in strict mask-mandate areas, avoided crowds and socializing, and STILL GOT IT. https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20201022/mask-use-by-americans-now-tops-90-poll-finds#1. We also know that cloth masks are not very good at reducing transmission by themselves - social distancing and proper ventilation are actually much better ways to reduce transmission.</p>
<p>Like I said, I get that it sucks, it's frustrating to live in this sort of time. But blaming other people is not the solution.</p>

        <p>Are we not on a sub all about the denial of how severe covid is? A sub of people trying not to wear masks in public? Are YOU not the boogeyman were talking about? </p>
<p>Where has anyone said cloth masks aren't very effective? They aren't AS effective but still reduce transmission upwards of 95% if every party is wearing them.</p>
<p>And thanks for the article saying that there was 90% mask wearing in October. Frankly 90% is quite low, 10% of Americans not wearing masks is 1/10 people in the Safeway lol, if anything you're proving my point that the covid denier anti maskers is real. Plus mask wearing numbers have gone down since October. You're not doing a good job at proving whatever your point is.</p>

        <p>Okay, deep breath, let's slow down and make sure we're reading here. Never once said people weren't wearing masks - I said you are vastly exaggerating the amount who aren't. That poll confirms my point.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, I think the only one in denial about COVID's severity is you. This is an illness with an incredibly high survival rate, even for at-risk folks. One study found that people believe they have a 23% chance of dying from the disease . . . even though the chances of dying are between 0.5-1%. This is concerning. https://www.news-medical.net/news/20200924/Many-people-are-overestimating-their-risk-of-becoming-seriously-ill-and-dying-from-COVID-19.aspx</p>
<p>The CDC itself acknowledges that cloth masks are not as effective as ventilation and distancing. It has also acknowledged that proper fit is vital to ensure transmission reduction. Just because you see someone wearing a mask does not mean you are safe - if it is too loose, too big, or too thin, they may as well not wear it.</p>
<p>Again, your issue here is not with other people. You feel scared and threatened because this is not something you can control. And I know that IS very scary, but you can't blame other people for that.</p>

        <p>I will continue to ALSO blame people who refuse to wear masks. It is not solely their fault yeah, but they contribute. Again you haven't really made a point to disprove anything I've said. </p>
<p>I've said most but not all people are being good about masks, but not everyone wears them and thats my problem. You proved that right for me great!</p>
<p>I argued that masks reduce transmission greatly, which they do! Maybe not as effective as ventilation and distancing, but you can't ventilate too well in a Safeway! Why not take ALL the precautions?</p>
<p>And frankly, about the death rate, its still pretty fucking high for a disease this mass transmitted. I mean you cannot deny the amount of people that have died since covid started. Its extremely deadly not because of the mortality rate, but because of the infection rate.</p>

        <p>No one is denying the amount of people that have died since COVID started. But the average of death in the US was 85. That absolutely does not mean their tragedies were no less significant, but when we're performing risk assessment, we need to make sure we're looking at the full picture.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, no, I didn't prove your point :( Masks do not reduce transmission significantly - social distancing and ventilation do. And surprisingly enough, you actually can ventilate very well in a Safeway, as long as the store 1) keeps its ventilation system updated 2) you avoid going at all, or avoid going during crowds. Which begs the question: if you are in fact so scared of anti-maskers because they might give you COVID, why the fucking hell are you going to any indoor facility at all? Do you not have store pick up/delivery options available? </p>
<p>You can continue to blame people for not wearing masks, but it's pointless, wrong, and illogical. You weren't even able to refute my point that getting a highly contagious disease like COVID is not the same as crashing your car and killing someone. The burden to avoid the disease falls on you. I get that that sucks, but if you're that worried, you shouldn't even be putting yourself into indoor situations.</p>
