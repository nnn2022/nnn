    <strong>I’m confused</strong>
    <p><p>So, I was wondering. Is this one of those “COVID is fake” or anti-vax/mask subreddits? Don’t get me wrong I hate the restrictions but I’m just interested in what this subreddit has to show. I just wanna know what I’m getting in to here, and don’t make this political, just throw down an answer.</p></p>

        <p>I dislike you "just asking" types arriving into this subreddit.</p>
<p>You never are genuine in asking that question, otherwise you would at least spend 30 seconds of your life reading the subreddit profile or looking up top posts over last few weeks.</p>
<p>It's always "Haha you guys are cray-cray, jk, just asking, don't make it political."</p>

        <p>Check out the description for the sub.</p>
<p>No one here legitimately thinks that this virus is fake, despite what people seem to think. The sub is founded upon the belief that this virus is, in fact, quite real. We just don't believe that the government shouldn't be implementing incredibly harmful mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns.</p>
<p>Most here aren't anti-vaxx, they're mostly just against this particular vaccine, or are skeptical of it. As far as masks, most here are against personally wearing them, because we aren't terrified and paranoid of this virus. But if someone wants to wear one, feel free, just don't try to make everyone else wear one too.</p>
<p>I don't see how you could be against all of the restrictions put into place, yet classify a sub that's against mask mandates as one of "those subs".</p>

        <p>I'm not anti-vaccine. I'm anti-forced vaccination. Also anti-lockdown, and anti-mask. And it's not because I'm some "uninformed republican drumfptser", or whatever the bullshit label-of-the-year is. Unlike the vast majority of people (at least in my country - Canada <em>*shudders*),</em> I don't get my information solely from the mainstream media. Oh, I watch and listen to them, in spite of their constant lies and propaganda. They still "report" on events and incidents, after all. I simply take it upon myself to do my own research after the fact. I go <em>directly</em> to the source.  </p>
<p>It's very easy to do this, once you know what to look for, and where to look for it. Oftentimes, the pertinent information is...right on the official government websites. Charts, graphs, percentages, numbers, dates, everything. Of course, they deliberately make the sites very user-<em>un</em>friendly, but that's nothing I can't handle. Though I could see how that might deter a less diligent person.  </p>
<p>Anyway, to the point: I looked at all the data, from <em>official sources</em> (not gleaning shit from Facebook, Twitter, InfoWars, FOX News, and all the other "bad" places - I don't even have Facebook or Twitter), and came to my own conclusions that, based on the numbers alone, the lockdowns and restrictions were all drastically overblown. As to the "how" and "why" of it all, there are all kinds of possible and probable reasons. After all I've seen over the past year, and given my own tendencies towards not trusting the government (full disclosure on that one, lol, I've hated the government since well before the "pandemic"), I'm inclined to believe that this has all been done for the purpose of seizing more power and control.  </p>
<p>The IFR (Infection Fatality Rate) of this virus is nothing to be remotely alarmed about, by my standards. Furthermore, by the numbers, the infection rate itself isn't even particularly bad, hovering in the vicinity of 1% globally on average (some places lower, some places higher).  </p>
<p>When you account for comorbidities and age, the rates drop even lower. The CDC's website clearly states that only some 5% of the total deaths in the US were recorded as "with COVID alone". Not even "from", but "with". Furthermore, and possibly most damning of all, they have a category under "poisonings and intentional/unintentional events" (or something to that effect). So essentially...accidents and murders. Last I checked, some 12,000 or so individuals were listed there. And added to the official tally of total "COVID" deaths.  </p>
<p>So, forgive me for my skepticism on all of this shit. But in my estimation, anybody who has seen the actual numbers, and has seen the way they tally the deaths and cases, and <em>doesn't</em> immediately stop and say "what the <strong>FUCK!?</strong>", is either willfully ignorant, or they're too stupid to live.  </p>
<p>That's why I'm here.  </p>
<p>Well, also to meme on Doomer Coof-Cultists who come around and try to act smug. It's a good way to pass time during the insomniac hours.</p>
