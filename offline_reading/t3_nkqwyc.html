    <strong>I think y'all will appreciate this...</strong>
    <p><p>I flew from Minnesota to Chicago yesterday, and have a legit medical exemption. I got up to security, and had my mask off while in the airport, knowing full well it would have to go on for the flight. </p>
<p>If you've not gotten to fly lately, they make you pull your mask off to check your ID against your face. The guy who I was dealing with told me to put my mask on, literally a second before he was going to tell me to take it off. </p>
<p>I mentioned that fact, and asked him if he really can't see how convoluted his instructions were. </p>
<p>He goes "what, you gotta problem?"</p>
<p>I said "yeah, that an under qualified TSA is giving me medical advice, as I have a medical exemption."</p>
<p>He got all huffy and puffy and said "Well... Well... You can't board the plane without it!"</p>
<p>I said "don't you think I know that already? I'm not boarding a plane right now, am I?"</p>
<p>And I passed through security with no mask, and not a single other person mentioned anything about it. </p>
<p>Dude looked kinda foolish, imo. I'm sure he thinks the same of me. However, I'm fighting for his freedoms by doing what I do, and his entire job is to diminish my right to be secure in my person and papers and property. I also called him a Nazi.</p></p>

        <p>TSA is the lowest of the low.  It takes more intelligence to work cashier at a supermarket.  A perfect example of a government agency created with good intentions, but which has been proven to be inept and now exists mainly to self-perpetuate.</p>

        <p>I agree 100%, save for the idea that they were created with good intentions. That's because nobody will ever convince me that 9/11 <em>wasn't</em> an inside job. "Patriot" Act, Homeland Security etc were only created to erode our liberties, from what I've seen. But I get what you're saying nonetheless.</p>

        <p>That would have been nice. Honestly it's all in the open already, though. The findings of the NIST report literally violate physics at points. I suggest looking into that. Building 7, as well. Larry Silverstein, the owner of the complex, said to "pull it", which is slang for commence detonation. Good on you for being a skeptic; even if you're wrong about it, it's always better to question than blindly follow the word of people who have a vested interest to lie.</p>

        <p>That's good to know, thank you! United does as well, but it's absurd hoops to jump. Un/fortunately, I fly on employee passes, so I'm limited to United and if I cause an issue I'll lose that so I basically have to slob the airline's knob. </p>
<p>However, I'm going to be promoting American now to everyone I know. Thanks again!</p>

        <p>You still need to jump through a few hoops. In Feb it said you needed a doctors note plus negative covid test or proof of recovery. I appreciated they included proof of recovery. Now it says:</p>
<p>This was the wording in Feb 2021: Exemptions will require documentation from a licensed health care provider, as well as proof of a negative COVID-19 test taken within three calendar days of departure or proof of recovery from COVID-19.</p>
<p>Current wording: <em>If you may be exempt because you have a disability that prevents you from safely wearing a mask as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 USC 12101 et. seq) you must contact us at least 72 hours before you plan to travel and travel with documentation confirming a negative COVID test or recovery.</em></p>
<p>So, it looks like no doctors note required anymore. May I ask what condition allows you not to wear one? I have a very difficult time with a regular fitting mask and flew numerous times with basically a light veil resting over my nose. Didn’t get a dirty look or comment even once. A n95 mask would render me unconscious on the floor within seconds. I tried once and never again.</p>

        <p>The light veil is what I always do too. No problems. Occasionally airlines in Europe mask force medical masks but even then there's a way around it. But in the US, as long as it's a covering, it doesn't seem like they care much. They now are forced to allow medical exemptions bc of the federal law they all begged for, but they make it as hard as possible, and expect pushback from someone along the way. In Europe it's easier to just wear one when boarding and pull it down- everyone else does that and the flight attendants don't care once you're on. But in the US since the poor maskers must be losing their minds right now, it's probably worth the hoops if you're flying far. It seems like there's a mask fight on a US flight every day. One would think they'd grow a brain and realize forcing them is creating more conflict than they already had by cramming seats together...but hoping airlines will do anything intelligently is futile.</p>

        <p>this bunch is so desperate to feel important...it is ALWAYS the low level employees that make a mask fuss. I wear a "face covering" when it can't be avoided, and 99% of the folks I encounter (including drs/pharmacy etc)- no problem. But there will always been an airport a-hole who insists on a mask. I'll put one on for the 30 seconds I deal with them, then switch back. If possible, I do it so they can see, as long as I am able to move away quickly so i don't have to deal with them any longer</p>
