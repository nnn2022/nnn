    <strong>Could this entire situation be "World War 3"?</strong>
    <p><p>Let's see...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Many countries (Australia being the best example) falling to authoritarianism along with their outright disdain for citizens showing more than ever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>China's talks about invading Taiwan during the last few months of 2021 reminds me of Germany invading Poland in September 1939, before starting World War 2. Also the entire Covid-1984 being from China as well, which would weaken their enemies as they would do a lot of self-inflicted damage, as seen throughout the past year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Huge information war currently, all the propaganda running rampant online + outright threats and instability of the main narrative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Presidents being assassinated (Haiti's one and the other presidents back in July/June of 2021 whom did not accept the vaccines, like... what the fuck?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think about it… the winner gets to take over the whole infrastructure unaffected, with a few survivors to serve as slaves to the future Great Reset?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is possible that some politicians are not aware, and really feel like they're "doing the right thing" by being authoritarian, but thats exactly how smart the enemies were in past mass hysteria events when they got the public to have irrational thinking... because FEAR was weaponized. I'm not denying there are some corrupt politicians 100% being complicit, but its  possible that some are unaware as well, and are thinking they're doing the right thing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It really makes more sense rather than believing it's about a "virus" with a 99% survival rate that countries have to fall to authoritarianism and outright shoot themselves in the foot.</p>
<p>Many people used to joke back in January 2020 about WW3 after USA's drone strike to assassinate Qasem Soleimani in Iran, back during Trump's administration, but I guess they were one year too early.</p>
<p>Covid-19 = World War 3 or Cold War 2.0 in disguise???</p></p>

        <p>I think it's a covert play to reduce the world population. We're too globally dependant on one another so WW3 seems so self destructive to the human race. It would be hard to pass a draft in the West without all the blue hairs freaking out and since manufacturing is basically all in Asia, it would require a HUGE upheaval of manufacturing to start things again. </p>
<p>But what they can do is trim the fat of all the people willing to continue with these constant pins and boosters. Control who wants to be controlled, and all the submissive unhealthy people will succub to their fate. </p>
<p>Am I too simplistic in thinking this is just basic level Darwinism at play here. </p>
<p>Side note: went to a party yesterday and the host was upset I'm unvaccinated and almost didn't get invited. (Athletic 32M). Meanwhile she's overweight, an alcoholic and a smoker. And I'm the threat to her health? </p>
<p>TLDR</p>
<p>Darwinism at play. If your friend jumped off a bridge would you? In the 90s, no. Now, yes.</p>

        <p>I assumed from the get go that it's a depopulation agenda, but that raises some questions. Why insist on trying to push it as mandatory for the military? One would think that killing off the military wouldn't be in the best interest for the elite. Also, why kill off the people that are more liable to blindly obey without raising a fuss? You'd think for convienence sake, they would want to keep alive the good little drones rather than the ones that will question everything or have a tendency to resist. </p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, there is something nefarious going on here. But the true agenda does start getting a little convoluted for me.</p>

        <p>You make some good points. I think if it were me, Id take a two pronged approach. </p>
<p>First I'd get as many sheep as possible to get it, keeping them compliant and indoctrinated.  Many of these people have been living luxuries of western civilization (restaurants, gyms, movies, etc) and they want the "peace and back to normal" to continue. Society has allowed them to continue to be obese, unemployment, smoke, drink, and suffer from multiple comorbidities. Being medicated by the pharma industry.</p>
<p>As they start to wane in physical health, coming out with new "varients" will allow them to act as useful idiots on my behalf for pushing my agenda of "vax passports". Example. NYC TODAY. </p>
<p>So as the vaccine starts to cause increasingly more complications over time, I've successfully culled the sheep herd of the weak, while simultaneously using them to push control and keep the Rams (healthy) gated in the pen. </p>
<p>In terms of the military, perhaps the military can be replenished once mandatory vaccination is implemented. Everyone will be vaxxed, so everyone can join the military. Additionally, it's the next generation of children that are now being indoctrinated into seeing adults who are panicking, masking, paranoia and will have a hell of a time standing up to a tyrannical government. </p>
<p>Just a bit of a thought experiment, take it for the bullshit that it is.</p>

        <p>But if everyone is vaxxed, wouldn't they make poor soldiers? I am pretty sure its only a matter of time before they're vaxxing babies at 6 months old, especially under the threat of having them removed from the parents if they tried to stop it. Eventually, they wouldn't make very good soldiers or workers if they're going around as sickly as their predecessors. </p>
<p>Of course, culling the herd would end up enforcing control over the divergent easier. The less likely it would be for mass awakening with less people, easier to enforce their will over a small group of people unable to man a large enough resistance to make their existence even somewhat threatening. </p>
<p>Good point, though, about the kids. It stops being strange when it's all you've ever known. Maybe at some point they hope to get to the point of not needing the vax once the population is closer to where they want it.</p>

        <p>No no no, not ww3. If anything it would be like the cold War but it's all informational. There was a British ship recently about 2 months ago that entered Russian territory in black sea but the Russian jets had him targeted. So then the ship turned around. They asked putin if ww3 would happen and he said no. They do such stupid things on purpose to spice up the hatred for more views. A scared citizen makes politicians happy. Because scared citizen obey. If you see a lot of conflict it would be mainly informational, and a 0retty big transfer of wealth from one country to another</p>
