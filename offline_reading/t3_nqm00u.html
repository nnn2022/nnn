        <p>If somebody died within 28 days of a positive covid test (of whatever reason), and it’s classed as a Covid death, then surely it’s classed as a vaccination death if somebody dies (of whatever reason) within 28 days of the vaccine?</p>

        <p>LOL. Nooo we can't talk about the fudged data. The narrative is entirely based on manipulated data with misleading labels that don't reflect the actual meaning of the statistic and how it's calculated. If people figure this out, they'll realize there is not a pandemic, never was a pandemic, and we intentionally lied. SHHHHH!!!!! Stop with your facts and logic!!</p>

        <p>You’re not the first person to come in here and pretend that you have insider information because you “work in a covid ICU”. If you were even a little observant, you would see just how much people post this same comment on our forum. I could toss a coin in the air and hit a doomer who has  “worked the covid ICU”. Last I checked being someone who teaches Emergency Medicine and has worked ERs &amp; worked as a Paramedic; not every nurse and their dog works ICU. Somebody is fucking lying and we are tired of it. Nobody here gives a single shit about your anecdotal bullshit experience in any ICU. Fuck off and hide in the basement, nobody wants you here.</p>

        <p>Right because calling people who have actually experienced the frontline work liars is super valuable 😆 Maybe the person you were replying to is full of shit, who knows, but the fact remains that the VAST majority of arguments in the covid denier arsenal are demonstrably false, intentionally misleading, or at the very least completely misunderstood and misrepresented information. Which is what they were pointing out.</p>
<p>When it's been a year and a half and the case is still 'the data is fake and everyone is lying!' with no actual credible evidence to support that claim, it's time to reexamine. When people are quick to point out 'dying with covid isn't dying from covid!' While they scream about anybody dying within a month after the vaccine MUST be from the vaccine, it's time to reexamine. When your arguments and memes rely on made up numbers and these threads are filled with people justifying them because 'these are probably right, because the numbers are fake!' It's time to reexamine. And most of all, when 'doomer' doesn't refer to the ones who are actively trying to convince people that all the governments of the world are working together on some master plan to take your freedom and reduce the population using vaccines, it's definitely time to reexamine. 😆</p>

        <p>You just made a lot of big claims without a shred of evidence. Again illustrating my point that you and people like you will come on here and say shit like that while not providing anything but “CNN said” and generalizing all of us to a single train of thought or theory. The only thing binding all of us here is being against lockdowns, masks, and the covid shots. Anything in between is your own imagination.</p>

        <p>Literally everything I just said is verifiable in this thread alone. And pot/kettle: I don't even watch CNN 🤷 I've spent the last year and a half formulating my opinion based on reading studies that I mostly selected from before covid to avoid inherent bias, in fact I can recommend a very interesting one about the economic benefits of universal masking during a global pandemic if you're interested. I've kept up on the vaccine developments, trials, side effects etc. I've 'followed the money' in the hospitals and drug companies. And I've at least considered and investigated every single 'anti' argument I've come across. I've not taken anybody's word for anything and at the very least seek out the information about a claim before I assume it's validity. And for what it's worth I also know multiple nurses who have worked in different covid wards, and met dozens more health care professionals when I was 3D printing ear savers and donated thousands of them last year. They all seemed pretty sure that this is real.</p>
<p>And if you recognize the fact that you don't support some of the things I mentioned regarding the company you keep here, it begs the questions why you aren't as perturbed by the way they present inaccurate information, and why you're against these things aside from simply being contrarian or afraid of the government. There have been millions more doses of vaccines than cases of covid, and exponentially fewer deaths and yet you're here supporting this bullshit meme. Why is that?</p>

        <p>Well I think this exchange already highlights my biggest issue with this whole thing, tbh. Especially at this point everyone already has their backs up, and everybody assumes that the other person is an archetype of one side or the other. In reality I think most people have much more nuanced opinions, and the flame wars prevent the much needed civil discourse that could have prevented a great deal of the division caused by this pandemic becoming a 'left vs right' political issue. </p>
<p>I would be open to discussing further, but I'm going to be tied up for the rest of the night so perhaps best to leave it at finding common ground and taking it as a reminder that not everybody is just parroting, on either side of the issue.</p>

        <p>Hey dude I agree actually. The worst part of this whole thing to me is throwing a label on everyone before they even get a chance to speak. I was just guilty of it myself and I apologize as my emotions took hold of me. I appreciate you as someone who was willing to talk and not just call me an idiot and run away. Have a great night.</p>

        <p>I never contradicted myself. You are using that word incorrectly. Anyways, I am typing replies because I am pissed off an annoyed with doomers coming in here saying the same old bullshit over and over again. You people lost. You people are being lied to and are willfully ignorant to all the evidence against you. Its exhausting. I have tried being nice and having intellectual conversations with people. Some work out pretty well and that person realizes they have not done their homework. Most people just resort to calling me stupid and defaming when they don’t have an argument. THAT is why I am pissed.</p>

        <p>I've very rarely seen this page come to a consensus about any issue... It ranges from I don't want the vaxx to it's going to be a mass extinction event. This page cherry picks anything it can. My long haul covid was just "in my head" and meanwhile people are posting about how they can sense a slight difference in energy in people who have been vaxxed.. they have a glaze over their eyes and shit. Implying that the vaxx is cooking their brain or some shit... Help me out here please, just point me towards some form of evidence to support all of the outrageous claims being thrown around on this sub. People here are actually saying that the vaxx is going to cause a mass extinction event while calling the media fear mongerers.... How is this sub not fear mongering with all these outrageous claims?</p>

        <p>The studies showed that the individuals had a rare propensity to develop blood clots in their brains due to their platelets bonding easier. It is unfortunate however the tests done on individuals with the same issue showed that the vaccine wasn’t to blame. That is why they have resumed both AstraZeneca and JNJ vaccines.</p>

<p>And before you say there has been no causitive link determined, remember that the CDC knew it's PCR testing had an 80% false positive rate yet reported those deaths as Covid deaths.</p>

        <p>Provide more accurate data then.</p>
<p>We "knew in like month two of the pandemic" that we could never have perfect data on this disease. The data we <em>do</em> have is still more useful than pulling random numbers out of the air and making policy decisions based on that.</p>
<p>What we <em>do</em> know is that more people died with COVID symptoms in the US, than died in WWI, WWII and the Vietnam put together.</p>
<p>What we <em>do</em> know is that the US averages 12-60k flu-related deaths every year, but we've got 10x that in COVID-related deaths - no matter how you spin that, you've still got 9x the number of flu-deaths to account for.</p>
