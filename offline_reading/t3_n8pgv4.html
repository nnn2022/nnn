        <p>Seriously though, all the doomers claim to want to do this to save grandma, but grandma doesn't give a shit. It's just so the doomers can virtue signal about how much they "care" about others. Or they're actually just brainwashed by the media. Perhaps both.</p>
<p>I was conversing with my great aunt the other day, who is in her 80s with plenty of health issues. She ranted about all the BS she's had to deal with because of the government deciding what's best for everyone. She lives her life as normal as she can, and said there's no way she's getting the vaccine. Almost all of my elderly family and most of the elderly in my community are more than tired of all this shit.</p>
<p>The only ones who give a fuck about this now-over pandemic is the woke and/or under-30 crowd that's insistent that we still need to be terrified and paranoid, as they're more than content sitting at home collecting free government money. Just like the ones who insist we all need to wear masks 24/7 are the under-30s.</p>

        <p>Ask them when was the last time they visited Grandma anyways? Before “covid” how often did they visit? When is the last time they called her? They don’t care about her. They are just doing what facebook/cnn/fox/google tells them to do.</p>

        <p>The younger generations have been intentionally dumbed down. They are not taught critical thinking or problem solving. They are not taught the unvarnished history of the world... and it doesn’t help that they are unbelievably spoiled while young in comparison to older generations.</p>

        <p>You gov is manipulated massively. These stats may not be as relevent as you think, only the people ages 18-29 who were actually given the poll to fill out feel this way. I personally found that if you answer in certain ways that typically don't suit an agenda, they stop sending you the polls to fill out.</p>

        <p>It is pretty well established that polls that ask basically the same question can get dramatically different results depending on how you word it.</p>
<p>However, I’m pretty sure they worded this question the same way to 18-29 year olds as to 65+ year olds.</p>

        <p>I don't know about the US, but in the UK the boomers aren't wearing masks because they're all vaxxed and they think they're immortal now. They have all the money in this country so they've always had that entitled air about them. You get the feeling that a lot of them would love vaccine passports to be rolled out this summer, because younger people aren't vaxxed, so the UK would be their oyster and theirs alone. That was kind of the case anyway because they have all the money and houses and young people have to spend on average 50-60% of their wages paying them rent.</p>

        <p>Well to be honest most haven't received the vaccine yet, still that's absolutely pathetic I was never worried about this in the first place and I am definitely not worried about it now that I have the vaccine so count me in that 16% of people with a god damn brain</p>

        <p>Yea but you still get sick and that small risk is always there. I mean measles isn't that deadly yet we all get the MMR vaccine don't we? If this was a 50% effective vaccine I wouldn't have seen any point in getting it but since it's 95% effective I thought it was worth getting</p>

        <p>It looks like people who maybe should have real concerns about the virus, don't, and are willing to take their chances with their immune systems to go mano a mano with the virus.  Sounds confident, strong, reasonable.</p>
<p>It look like people who should definitely not worry about it are cowering in their cars, alone with a mask on, crying into their Tik Tok about the selfish assholes who breathed in their vicinity, and have a severe case of chicken little butthurt that people would dare break the rules.  Sounds afraid, dehumanized, desperate to be told what to do.</p>
<p>The wussification of the youth is complete.</p>

        <p>I am a wimp, so I don't want to wear a piece of cloth that restricts my breathing with unknown long-term consequences of long-term use without offering any protections from viruses that do not appear to be a threat when you look at more than a year of direct empirical evidence.</p>
