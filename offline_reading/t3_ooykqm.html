    <strong>It's all in the profit margin -- remember that when you're tempted to get vaccinated!</strong>
    <p><p>Something I keep thinking about as threats pop up of mandatory vaccines, 'green passports' (a vaccine, a negative Covid test or proof of recovery from Covid), being banned from events, shops, restaurants, travel etc if you don't get vaccinated is this:</p>
<p><strong>TAKE A DEEP BREATH, CALM DOWN, REFUSE THE VACCINE, REFUSE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE IDIOCY AND GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>BECAUSE....no matter how serious and threatening this all seems now, NONE of this will be permanent, and there is a good reason why.</strong></p>
<p>And it's all to do with <strong>PROFIT MARGINS....</strong></p>
<p>Here's what I mean by that:</p>
<p>When you look at just about any industry -- retail (shops/department stores etc), restaurants/cafes, concerts/entertainment venues, museums, hotels, airlines and on and on, <strong>NOT ONE OF THEM can survive long-term</strong> <strong>if they lose even 30% of their clients.</strong></p>
<p>Considering, in most countries, at least 30-40% of the population isn't vaccinated, and has no intention of ever getting vaccinated unless illegally forced to, all of those people will be supposedly excluded from participating in normal life if they either aren't vaccinated or refuse to subject themselves to Covid tests every 48-72 hours.</p>
<p>That 30% is basically the profit margin for just about every business on the planet. Take that away and what do you have? </p>
<p>Millions of businesses struggling for survival and screaming at the government to "do something" to save them.</p>
<p>As well as almost every country suddenly realizing it has had an enormous drop in its tourism income, and thus its GDP, as one third of the planet isn't allowed to travel there.</p>
<p>So...the next time you're panicking about being mandated to get a vaccine just so you are allowed to do anything, decide to stay home instead while saving your money for the day when all this stupidity ends.</p>
<p>As more of us do this, more businesses will begin to panic as they see their profits disappearing.</p>
<p>Only then will there be an enormous backlash against government mandates and these idiotic 'rules' will end.</p>
<p>In other words, never ever ever get a vaccine just so you can 'participate in life' because, if you do, the rules for participating in that life will keep changing. Until we are all in a position where there is little life left.</p></p>

        <p>I totally disagree. They don’t care about small business disappearing. It just increases the revenue of billionaire companies. The future as they see it is no small independently owned business. That is the industry being killed. The massive companies worth billions aren’t taking this hit they have purposefully caused. 1/3 won’t be the people left unvaccinated in the end. It will definitely be much less with every freedom taken away. This doesn’t stop at your freedom to  travel or go to a pub or restaurant. It will infiltrate every aspect of your life. Job, healthcare, welfare even going to retail stores, supermarkets and pharmacies.</p>

        <p>Not true.</p>
<p>Big business doesn't survive when half of the population is destitute as, no money,  no buying anything from big business either.</p>
<p>And to think the goal of this is doing away with small businesses is nothing but a conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>The real reason why we are in the hysterical panicked mess we are in, IMO, is the politicization of a virus so that various parties can score 'points' for themselves.</p>
<p>Look at the Democrats (and I was a lifelong Democrat before this bullshit -- not anymore). They weren't harping on about mandatory masks until Trump said he wouldn't wear one, and then we all of a sudden ALL have to wear masks to 'save us'. </p>
<p>And it's the same in almost every country. One party trying to outdo each other with stricter and stricter mandates, just to pander to panicked morons.</p>

        <p>I don’t think you have any real argument except a glimmer of fake hope. Massive business like Amazon have made billions from this. To deny that is either insanity or purposeful misinformation.</p>

        <p>You are missing the point.</p>
<p>Amazon and other companies may have made billions from this, but when millions of small businesses are closing down and laying off the hundreds of millions they employ, an enormous percentage of people no longer have the money to prop up Amazon.</p>
<p>Amazon benefits if the general populace has money to spend. It dies along with every other business when they do not.</p>

        <p>The companies currently profiting from this are hiring employees. So basically they will be paying people to pay back into their company who have lost their jobs due to the lockdowns. </p>
<p>The final amount of people left willing to not take the vaccine will be much less than 30%. In the U.K. we are at 54.4% vaccinated and the only things taken away from the unvaccinated who are too poor to pay for extra testing and isolating are holidays abroad at the moment. Lots of people can’t afford to lose their income, healthcare and ability to even buy things in a supermarket rather than take a vaccine. Most people have a point they will just comply at. </p>
<p>If this was to be stopped it had to happen way before this much of a percentage of people had been vaccinated. Once the majority are vaccinated it’s easy to pressure a lot of the outsiders to comply. Remember the majority also want to return to normal and get rid of their fear of the unknown. The media and government have made the unvaccinated the scapegoats who are preventing the return to normal.</p>

        <p>It could happen but, IMO, it's highly doubtful. </p>
<p>Remember, right now we're still in the rush of hysteria. But more people are beginning to tire of all this bullshit. Especially the vaxxed who are  now finding out that vaccination didn't help them go back to 'normal' at all.</p>
<p>Look at what has happened in France this week. After mass street protests, Macron already being forced to pull back and water down the so-called punishments for those who won't follow his 'green pass' rules, whether they are the people refusing to vaccinate or those businesses refusing to check their vaccination information.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/france-rules-coronavirus-green-pass-vaccine-backlash/">https://www.politico.eu/article/france-rules-coronavirus-green-pass-vaccine-backlash/</a></p>
<p>Austria is apparently experiencing some of the same. They have had a green pass in place for weeks and Austrian businesses, who suffered massively during that country's endless lockdowns, are already complaining its killing their businesses as so many people choose to stay at home instead.</p>
<p>People do not have endless patience or endless fear. Eventually they begin to push back. Something that is already happening in Australia against their ridiculous lockdowns, California against their masks mandate showing back up and on and on.</p>

        <p>Yeah, you’re right. Nothing lasts forever. This isn’t sustainable. Also there are so many more of us than I think people realize. They would need weapons of mass destruction and then what would be left for them? A world filled with their dead relatives and former friends who disagreed with them.</p>
