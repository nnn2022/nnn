    <strong>People who want to get vaccinated are awesome for us</strong>
    <p><p>The new chemicals that are falsely labelled "vaccines" kill or create side-effects based on studies as I recently quoted - look for my post history.</p>
<p>Now aren't you annoyed by those who say "take the vaccine" and who cave in to everything their government says?</p>
<p>Just enjoy the ride.</p>
<p>Let them have the "vaccine". Let them die a painful death.</p>
<p>Nobody needs those obedient opportunists.</p>
<p>Just let them talk and have chemicals kill them. It has never been easier to get rid of useless people.</p>
<p>Instead of warning those people, encourage them.</p>
<p>"Go get the vaccine, it's okay, everyone does it"</p>
<p>PS: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBAHRgtuI4I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBAHRgtuI4I</a></p>
<p>PPS: Most people warn others hoping to be reassured BY THEM that this virus is harmless. This is a dangerous openness that you need to get rid of by reading more of the right literature. Once you realize without a doubt what is right and wrong, stop trying to get reassurance from the enemy.</p></p>

        <p>An interesting contradiction. Probably it's because the government is not one unified system but a patchwork, whose parts don't communicate well with each other.</p>

        <p>why not kill off the idiots? that makes the rest of us are easier to identify. if there are evil overloads running things, which there are, wouldn't it be more fun for them to have to hunt us down before they  turn us into slave workers? Just a thought.</p>

        <p>I think it's more of the fact they are shoving an experimental vaccine out without taking any precautions that they normally take when dealing with other vaccines, and forcing us to take said experimental vaccine.</p>

        <p>The length of time is not ideal but we had pretty exhaustive trials. </p>
<p>I'm more pissed about the never ending restrictions and it being sold as a functionally ineffective vaccine by <em>experts</em> themselves.</p>
<p>I definitely see why people are skeptical..</p>

        <p>No, it doesn't seem right. </p>
<p>Everyone can be brainwashed, but the price you're talking about is too high.</p>
<p>Besides these people have children and unfortunately they decide for them. And any of your friend or relatives can fall into this trap, so we can't just give them up.</p>
<p>And I also think that the vast majority of those people are just a nice (or semi-nice :)  people, but they were brainwashed by aggressive propaganda. And most of them are not "dangerous or aggressive",in most cases  they're only harming themselves.</p>
<p>So the real "enemy" is not this silent majority, they just go with the flow, but those who stand behind this propaganda. </p>
<p>And they use all the power of the state, MSM, big tech and social media to push their agenda. And everyone who goes against the main narrative is silenced and presented in a ridiculous way. Anti-science, ant-vaxx, racist, bigot, crazy conspiracy theorist etc, etc. </p>
<p>I also guess they use the bots in this information war much more intensively than we can imagine....So each time you see the post of some woke person, keep in mind that it may be just a bot, who get paid for what he's saying. Others just repeating their "mantras". Besides in most cases there are  behavioral consulting agencies behind those mantras. (this is one example) <a href="https://www.bi.team/blogs/four-messages-that-can-increase-uptake-of-the-covid-19-vaccines/">https://www.bi.team/blogs/four-messages-that-can-increase-uptake-of-the-covid-19-vaccines/</a></p>
<p>And actually they are losing their momentum. The further they go, the more ridiculous the reality looks, and their lies become too obvious, and it's harder and harder for them to hide their plans.</p>
<p>And the less people fall into this trap, the better.</p>
