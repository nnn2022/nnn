    <strong>How the actions of governments and social media companies prove that this has always been about control, not safety:</strong>
    <p><p>If our governments and health officials genuinely cared about keeping people out of hospitals, improving outcomes and saving lives, they wouldn’t be actively discrediting and censoring drugs like ivermectin, which have shown to be effective not only as a prophylactic, but as a treatment as well.</p>
<p><strong>Some evidence of the effectiveness of ivermectin:</strong></p>
<p>Large scale analysis of evidence showing Ivermectin is an effective prophylactic and treatment for Covid-19: https://covid19criticalcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/FLCCC-Ivermectin-in-the-prophylaxis-and-treatment-of-COVID-19.pdf</p>
<p>The use of Ivermectin-based home kits drastically reduces hospital occupancy from Covid patients in Mexico: https://trialsitenews.com/mexico-city-wide-innovative-population-level-study-administers-ivermectin-based-home-kits-with-drastic-reduction-in-hospitalizations/</p>
<p>Graphs showing the effect ivermectin has on fatalities and hospitalizations when used as a prophylaxis: https://www.dropbox.com/s/28oa0byp3k0j9g2/GRAPHS%20OF%20IVERMECTIN%20COUNTRY%20USAGE%20-%20DHP%20ep83.pdf?dl=0</p>
<p>What is genuinely insane is that there has been such a large scale effort to censor alternative treatments such as ivermectin, that in YouTube’s community guidelines <em>it is mentioned by name</em>.</p>
<p>Direct quote from YouTube’s community guidelines page:</p>
<p><strong>”Don’t post content on YouTube if it includes any of the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Content that recommends use of Ivermectin or Hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19</strong></li>
<li><strong>Claims that Ivermectin or Hydroxychloroquine are effective treatments for COVID-19”</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Source: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9891785?hl=en</p>
<p>This is how dedicated the censorship campaign against these treatments has been.</p>
<p>They are purposefully making sure alternative treatments that show enormous promise and have already saved many lives do not make it into the hands or minds of the masses. </p>
<p>Just think of how many people could have potentially been saved had ivermectin been on the table as a viable option since day one and had the proper research conducted in as quick of a time-span as possible.</p>
<p>These people do not care about your health.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as time passes data is starting to emerge that these lockdowns which caused such exponential amounts of harm not only to the populations upon which they were inflicted, but to the economies of the nations where they occurred as well, actually do next to nothing in terms of preventing cases or deaths.</p>
<p>A study was conducted starting when Texas opened up 100%, what they found was that the reopening had <em>zero</em> discernible impact on cases or deaths: https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28804/w28804.pdf</p>
<p>There has also been analyses done that show lockdowns do disproportionately more harm than good: http://www.sfu.ca/~allen/LockdownReport.pdf</p>
<p>As well one done by a data scientist at MIT that showed lockdowns are not correlated with fewer deaths, but are correlated with more unemployment: https://fee.org/articles/mit-data-scientist-lockdowns-not-correlated-with-fewer-deaths-but-are-correlated-with-more-unemployment/</p>
<p>Beyond that, there is a multitude of other examples that they do not work, Florida being another prime one, as well as Sweden. https://shahar-26393.medium.com/not-a-shred-of-doubt-sweden-was-right-32e6dab1f47a</p>
<p>Besides, the lockdowns haven’t made any sense from the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>Here are the best estimates of survival rates for different age groups from the CDC:</strong></p>
<p>For people under 18 the best estimate for a survival rate is a staggering <strong>99.998%</strong>.</p>
<p>For people over 18 and below 50, it is <strong>99.95%</strong>.</p>
<p>For people over 49 and younger than 65, it is <strong>99.4%</strong>.</p>
<p>For people 65 and over, it is <strong>91%</strong>.</p>
<p>Source: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html</p>
<p>For <strong>anybody under the age of 65</strong>, the survival rate is over <strong>99%</strong>.</p>
<p>This is a very important fact.</p>
<p>What this lets us know is that our plan should be and should have been focused on protecting those over 65 or those with conditions that would increase their risk, while allowing the rest of society to continue functioning to avoid the unnecessary suffering of the healthy and the disastrous societal consequences of shutting everything down, especially the economic impact.</p>
<p>The fact that governments continue to employ these absurdly harmful lockdowns despite the obvious lack of rationality involved, as well as the rising evidence disproving their effectiveness shows that they are not concerned with the option that will do the most good or save the most lives, they are concerned about control.</p>
<p>It’s never been about keeping people out of hospitals and it’s never been about keeping you safe, their actions have run counter to those goals at every turn. </p>
<p>There is an enormous amount of power being consolidated and our rights and freedoms are being stolen. Do not trust the people that time and time again prove to not have your best interests in mind, it may just cost you everything.</p>
<p>Do not lose hope either, all is far from lost. </p>
<p>Instead, join the resistance and rally with me and millions around the globe to fight for our rights and freedoms and make sure those behind all of this are held accountable for their crimes against humanity.</p>
<p>Remember, the power has and will always truly lie with the people, not the state.</p>
<p>Wake up, stand up and speak out. 
Freedom will triumph.</p></p>
