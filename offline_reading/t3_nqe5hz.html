        <p>“So when people say, ‘Well why did you change your stance? And why areyou emphasizing masks so much now when back then you didn't -- and infact you even said you shouldn't because there was a shortage of masks?’ Well the data now are very, very clear,”</p>
<p>He admitted masks were useless, regardless of asymptomatic or not. And eventually data came out that said asymptomatic transmission wasnt significant. How could he consider the science backing up the mask mandate to be "<strong>VERY, VERY CLEAR"</strong> when it was changed abruptly and then a year later it gets refuted. so where did that data come from that indicated we should wear masks?</p>
<p>Why was the notion of asymptomatic transmission pushed so hard when it wasnt conclusive (to the point i think was eventually refuted)? it was essentially a paranoid conspiracy of hypochondria.</p>

        <p>Doomers will continue to insist that the “science around covid was constantly evolving”’and that’s why fauci flip-flopped left and right! He said in early February 2020 that masks wouldn’t work with covid because the virus particles are too big and now that the emails are out, the doomers are still insisting that he pushed masks later on because the science changed!</p>
