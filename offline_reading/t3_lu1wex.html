    <strong>The absolute irony of the lockdown doomers saying that us “ignoring the restrictions will just kill us off and the world will be a better place without us”.</strong>
    <p><p>Gather around boys and girls. This is some hilarious irony.</p>
<p>So we’ve all heard it or seen the posts. “Whatever, go out without a mask and you’ll die and the world will be a better place”.</p>
<p>Not so fast Karen and Terry. They’ve ignored one crucial factor, and it’s supported by my own anecdotal evidence and good ol’ common sense.</p>
<p>Right now the only people starting new relationships (and we’re not talking about doomer penpals.com type shit) are those going out and meeting new people. Added bonus is that they’re going out and able to access a dating pool that isn’t handicapped by doomers (who are on average mentally ill, less attractive, and less intelligent). So the chances of not only starting a relationship, but it being a successful one is higher than its ever been in modern human history.</p>
<p>These people will have kids. And these kids will all be born with a lower risk of mental illness and low IQ.</p>
<p>Add to this, the only current couples I know who are still trying to have kids are non-doomer couples. Fuck, I’ve even heard of some doomer couples going completely sexless to “stop the spread”. Again, that will yield another batch of NoNewNormal kids who will be raised with the right mix of values and common sense.</p>
<p>The doomers are practicing self-cannibalization... and it’s fucking beautiful.</p></p>
