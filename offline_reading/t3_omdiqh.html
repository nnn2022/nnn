    <strong>The unvaccinated bullshit contradicts the main narrative and is a straw man fallacy.</strong>
    <p><p>And this is why I'll NEVER label myself as "unvaccinated". Now, let me shed some light behind this affirmation. I'm sure that you have been paying attention to recent news that claim that this dangerous group of unvaccinated people that are the cause of this everlasting pandemic and they are the ones to blame for the new variants, etc etc. But if you pay close attention they are never specific about the experimental jab. They don't write a line about how people that are refusing to take the experimental mRNA shot are the ones to blame. Why not? Because that this would pull a trigger inside the reader's mind that would wonder why someone would refuse to take an experimental shot. And here is the little secret to that fallacy. It's all about how the propaganda will pull the triggers that control your thoughts and ideas. </p>
<p>This can be called semantic distortion or semantic trick. The language, thoughts, ideias, feelings and emotions are all connected. If they craft their propaganda carefully they will reach the desired result. This is a "if the shoes fit..." situation. It's a vague BOGEYMAN in the same lines as "racist" or something similar. Don't play by their rules.  I'm pretty sure that most of you have took, at least, one vaccine in your life, so, you're not an unvaccinated person, but some of you didn't take the experimental COVID-19 shot, right? This means that this mythical unvaccinated monster they talk about it's an entire different thing.</p>
<p>Also, another reason this is a bogeyman (straw man fallacy) and not about you or me, it's because they clearly distort everything about refusing to take the jab. What they mean with an "unvaccinated person" is someone that is stupid, ignorant, uninformed, selfish, reckless and is roaming around the globe spreading disease.  <strong>But this is another bullshit, because they describe the COVID-19 as being a deadly, a murderous disease, if this is true, all this unvaccinated people wouldn't be fooling around, THEY WOULD BE IN A HOSPITAL BED, THEN IN A CEMETERY!</strong>  Yes, they discarded the asymptomatic and grandma thing a long time ago, now the new variant is killing everyone and their pets.</p>

        <p>Good post. Few look beyond the narrative and think critically. They can literally make up anything now no matter how ridiculous. Media are activists for the globalists. </p>
<p>I don't know how to counter such an enormous influence that's traumatized and brainwashed billions.</p>

        <p>I think the word "unvaccinated" is a framing device. It asserts that the normal state of being is to be vaccinated. Until this last year, I never heard anyone use the term "unvaccinated", even when referring to actual anti-vaxxers. If you type the word "unvaccinated" into a program with a built-in spell checker that isn't controlled by Google, I guarantee you'll see a red squiggle appear under it.</p>

        <p>Precisely. They're playing with the words "approved" or "licensed" as well. In my country if I search "approved vaccines" in Google, they'll deflect and return something else vaccine related. Curious, since google loves to give a specific answer to popular topics.</p>

        <p>&rt;I think the word "unvaccinated" is a framing device.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Just like "conspiracy theorist","denier", etc. - all of these are Meme Words to program the unconscious minds of those who are not conscious enough to "catch" it, thus slipping in the unconscious.</p>
<p>Then, when someone hears that Meme Word again, the unconscious program being already accepted without the person acknowledging in the first place, <em>it will just trigger itself without the person being conscious of it.</em></p>
<p>This is psychological warfare. And we didn't arrived here "over-night".</p>

        <p>Yes there is a lot of 'word salad', repackaging of already known science, lying by obscuring the full truth, and trickery regarding free will to get people to give up their rights..</p>
<p>It takes a lot of discernment (Prudence) that frankly many many people have failed to develop in their lie time (also due diligence) and they will pay for that.</p>

        <p>This is related with the PCR test. You can research this sub, there are lots of discussions about its accuracy. </p>
