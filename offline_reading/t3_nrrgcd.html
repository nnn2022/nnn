    <strong>How long did it take you to realize this had nothing to do with a virus?</strong>
    <p><p>I pretty much went along with the first lockdown and had some hope when they started opening up for the summer of 2020.</p>
<p>Then when the curve was at its LOWEST, they put up the mask mandate. I started doubting. It was in order <em>to prevent a second wave</em> they told us.</p>
<p>As I should have expected, they announced a four-week lockdown in early October. I was pretty much on the fence by that point. When they renewed it for another four weeks, I was gone. I started being vocal anywhere I could about this scam, started attending protests (for the first time in my life), etc.</p></p>

        <p>I called it out of the gate, but it became concrete for me around april 20th 2020 when I was listening to independent doctors in the field who were coming out with their own findings that contradicted that of the main stream. Then got censored within the week of them releasing their information. This told me everything I needed to know. I've learned a long time ago. You do not listen to the words being spoken. You watch the actions being taken.</p>

        <p>After I witnessed elderly relatives get Covid in March 2020 ages 91 &amp; 95 (who were not in best health to start with) get through Covid with ease I knew the reaction to Covid was MUCH WORSE than the actual virus itself. So I used the opportunity to travel the country on wide open flights without fear.</p>
