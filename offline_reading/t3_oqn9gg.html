    <strong>some people do not know what real freedom could feel like ... that is how they do not notice its absence</strong>
    <p><p>i am trying to reason with myself why i feel like living in .. 2 mt ... year two of medical tyranny</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>while looking at the mass media and also at the comments on social media attached to news and oppinion articles, it seems like a lot of people are into this big governement telling everyone how to behave thing</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>mmmh... i think i blame the human species disrespect for its offprings inherent wisdom</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the newborn baby comes out of its mothers womb after having spent several months with eyes closed, fully embraced by nourishing wetness, sharing one bloodstream with its mother, sending its stem cells to her to heal her damages so she can be a better provider ... the newborn baby is at its peak mental/emotional/physical cellular fitness level</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>and from there onwards the human tragedy unfolds ... during the next 18 years a long line of stupid damaged adults compete with each other who is allowed to impregnate its faulty mindset onto the newborn, their motivation to do so is both a sort of vampirism, basking themselves in the purity of the newborn sucking off its vitality but at the same time there is also a sort of jealousy and regret coming with the realization how superior the newborns fitness is ... and thats where the impregnation drive hits ... this destructive propping upon of a well known faulty behaviour upon a potential healing and reforming young tree/newborn baby</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>this is how the human species continues to loose its most valuable asset ... its most potential healing agents ... the newborns who eventually know how to heal all what humanity is sick off, how to potentially renew their own physical cells indefinitly and therefore not need to experience decay and vulnerability to decomposing agents of nature </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>and because our very own human tradition to constantly oppress anything what could show a way out of our own self produced mess we are somewhat enjoying in a sado-maso style ... most of us human beings have not the faintest idea what real freedom could be and therefore anyone who comes along with some abusive plan to command obeyance for the most stupid measures like restricting ones own free airflow, forcing oneself to stay away from loved ones, coersing others to demand of them to leave contact details so they can later be incarcerated ... all these horrible restrictions, no what do i say ... attrocities against any decency ... are being followed with either mild complacency or by some with eager interest as to participate in such a horror behaviour provides some sort of satisfaction what again is similar to the adult what sucks the life force out of a newborn while treating it with a ... you-dont-know-nothing-i-will-teach-you-all .... attitude what at the very same time is exactly what hinders the human species to evolve</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>okay now ... problem named, where is the sollution:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>first of all ... its the newborn who knows at all times what it wants to do, wether it wants to sleep, to eat, to drink, to do excretions ... and its up to the adults what are blessed to be in its presence to learn to understand how the baby talks to them</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>this is the most important part</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>and if the baby in such a way receives respect, is never forced to do anything, never gets force fed or put to sleep artificially with this or that trick ... if the young child at all times is allowed to move like it wants, if it never receives any remonstrating or scolding but all what it wants to do is being accepted as its own inner wisdom</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>this then will be the foundation to build up on ... what would greatly help then, if the child as soon as it becomes interested what happens in society, when it starts to interact with the adults, asking them stuff and giving them advise or suggestions how they could improve their ways ... if the adults then would continue to let the child do its thing, trusting that it self knows what it wants and thats its motivation is pure and guided by a benevolence for its own devellopment as well as a wellmeaning towards all fellow life forms</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>this attitude of respecting the young human being as its own personal sovereign human being what at all times can choose with whom it wants to be, where it wants to be, doing what, being how, eating, drinking what ... </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>would then ideally find its expression in a political reality where all permanent residents of a local community, of a village, a town, a city-district, all human beings of all ages and all places of birth ... would be able to come together and talk to each other on equal level ... each one acknowledging each others same weighted voting power when it comes to decision making what impact all of who live permanently in this place</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>of course this then would require that the local community would have freed itself first from the very empire structure we in the western world suffer under since these crazy citizens of rome 2000 years ago decided to venture out across the european continent to rob everyone of their lands and dominate them into submission under the banner of the eagle</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>it would require that we who are each others neighbours ... would free ourselves of all political hierarchies ... nation state dominates regional state dominates local community ... and install a participative democracy on the only real level there is ... the level where people live together side by side each day</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>but how could we possibly do that, how could we rebuild our political structures from a representative hierarchical democracy towards an equal level decentralised participative democracy</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>i see one gentle and smooth way, but also one what requires some patience and willingness to self-reflect on ones very own personal secret wish to become ... master of the universe, president, top boss, master blaster ... smile ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>no really ... i see a decent way forwards what would allow us to make every local community become its own absolute political sovereign ... and it is the renewal of regional states constitutions and nation states constitutions using concepts for example like:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>the local community is its own absolute political sovereign</p>
<p>it inherits all political decision powers from the regional and the nation state</p>
<p>the local sovereign community creates, maintains and interpretes its own full law, all rules made by inviting every child, youth and adult permanent member to participate in all political decision finding processes with each one acknowledging each others same weighted political voting power</p>
<p>this local law valid on the communitys territory replaces all laws previously made on the regional and nation state level</p>
<p>all local sovereign communities inherit/receive a fair share of all material and financial wealth of the regional and nation state, the size of the share calculated in proportion to the numnbers of permanent residents</p>
<p>every local sovereign community at all times without conditions is able to exit/quit/leave the regional and nation state</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>as a consequence then of such a reformed constitution of both the regional and the nation state, the then its own absolute sovereign local community ... </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>possibly having reached such a constitutional reform via collecting signatures from each other for a citizens referendum and or a people initiative ... legal tools what</p>
<p>many modern nation states today have allready installed ( as a sort of political "hand brake" style of tool in case too many of the representatives in parliaments and councils would have given in to corruption ... )</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the local sovereign community then would have a chance to use the financial inheritance of regional and nation states which would have given up their political powers</p>
<p>use the communal finances to buy the one thing what comes second in terms of providing room for freedom, just right after the mutual respect of human beings for personals individual sovereign choices ... free direct access to land for every human being to sustain itself</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>my body my choice ...  wether i am one year old or 105, wether i am born here or there ... no one gets to tell me what i can eat, drink or otherwise ingest(inject) into my body, what sort of clothes i want wear covering or not what parts of my body</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>my mind my choice ... no one gets to tell another one what to think about, what to listen to , what to read ... wether one is 5 years old or 95 ... </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the human diginity is inviolable </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>so beside the most important thing of... </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>my mind and body, my choice </p>
<p>how to move, feed, treat, heal it ...  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the second most important thing is ... seen from my personal viewpoint, me being named andreas buechel, born on 18th of december 1975 in the town of st.gallen, currently occupied by the nation state switzerland ( and since the 7th of june 2021 prisoner in switzerland under the regime of the covid-certificate, the 7 federal councils of switzerland demanding of me to give a piece of my body ( dna ) to them so they would decide wether or not i could leave and reenter switzerland ... ) </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>second most important freedom enabling thing could be that every human being from earliest age on has direct acces to mother earth, has the possibility to build its own shelter and grow its own food so it is not dependant anymore towards others charity and also is not dependant upon to beg with them for being allowed to be their submissive employee or rent an appartement from them ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>therefore i see how a local community what is its own sovereign and all children, youth and adults without representatives, without councils decide all in a participative equal manner ... how such a circle of equals would want to buy as much as possible farmland and forest from private owners who would be willing to sell it because they would understood how important it could be for every one human being to be able to live in a house one built with its own hands, to grow ones own food ... because the farmers and forest owners know very well of how much strength arises from grounding oneself into earth what sustains oneself</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>and the child then could grow up in a mental atmosphere where the adults surrounding it could tell it: </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>" you know, whenever you are ready, just tell us, we have reserved for everyone who is a citizen of this village/town/city-district ... some 1000 m2 of fertile soil, what everyone who wants it can receive as a free of tax duty, free of rental demands loan for a lifetime to sustain oneself, to be ones own boss at all times, never need to sell any produce to anyone else or buy anything from anyone, never need to ask anyone for any favour but purely live from what one can build with ones own hands, build ones own house, enjoy the fruits and vegetables one has helped to grow with ones own garden work" </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>that is what i would call real freedom: </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>to own nothing but be free forever </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>to own nothing but be surrounded by fellow human beings who respect each others full personal individual sovereignity </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>to own nothing but know that one will be able to live till ones last breath on that 1000 m2 of loaned fertile soil in the house one built with ones own hands </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>because one would be part of the circle of equals who too owns nothing but tries to faciliate fair access to the source of life so that </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>land, water, air and fire may bless us all </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>and </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>we may grow strong </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>to infinity and beyond </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>towards the second star to the left and then continuing right till the morning dawn</p></p>

        <p>Freedom is subjective. To some, freedom requires not having to spend excessive hours working. To others it's as simple as getting to live a basic, leave-me-be existence. Some enjoy the idea of a government that just handles everything</p>
<p>Its simply not simple</p>
