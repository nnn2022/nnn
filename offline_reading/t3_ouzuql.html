    <strong>Vaccinated Persons for Informed Consent</strong>
    <p><p>Hello!  If you're vaccinated and realize that the concept of forcing it on  people is insane, please speak up! The situation is beyond dire. We  are  careening into the stuff of nightmares. The rise, or rather, the  unveiling of a new brand of totalitarianism, the likes of which humanity  has experienced nothing remotely close to. If you’re vaccinated and  you’re here -- step out at speak up! If you’ve considered  the  information we share and still chose to get vaccinated, FANTASTIC!  It’s YOUR choice! Please use your status and do the right thing. This is an internet forum  frequented predominately by American citizens, and America is the  last  bastion. Recognize that your complicity is on the fast track to very  possibly becoming a partial cause of civil war, internment, genocide,  and a host of other horrors. Please, someone who is vaccinated and still  cares, organize others like you and ACT.</p>
<p>I close with a blurb and quote that is of the highest possible relevance in the zeitgeist.</p>
<p>“  Martin Niemöller (1892–1984) was a prominent Lutheran pastor in   Germany. He emerged as an outspoken public foe of Adolf Hitler and spent   the last seven years of Nazi rule in concentration camps. He is  perhaps  best remembered for his postwar words,</p>
<p>First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a socialist.</p>
<p>Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out— because I was not a trade unionist.</p>
<p>Then they came for the XXX, and I did not speak out—because I was not a XXX.</p>
<p>Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.“</p>
<p>Sub doesn't allow saying word where XXX is but you can imagine what it is.</p></p>
