    <strong>My take on the newest CDC lies</strong>
    <p><p>The government is not happy about the amount of people refusing vaccines. Biden’s 100 million in 100 days isn’t looking good if vaccines are being thrown out (although with their sordid history of inflating numbers, I’m confident the number will be hit.) They need a way to get more people to take these jabs. So, therefore, it has been decided to slightly relax recommendations for people with the shot. Not really much of a change mind you but a taste of freedom as a way to entice into compliance. Hard to believe that anybody still takes this organization seriously anymore.</p></p>

        <p>Lol I forgot about his 100 million in 100 days .. didn't Trump say the same ? Operation Something something ?</p>
<p>They will just add in the doses of those that got over vaccinated, add in the trashed vaccines, and all the guinea pig prisoners etc they're probably forcing to be vaccinated or coercing with more phone time etc to be vaccinate and claim they reached the goal.</p>

        <p>now that they approved it for testing on infants and children I am sure there is a large population of American children who are "wards of the state" foster kids, etc who will be forced to get it and have no choice because their guardian is the government. It is ok. </p>
<p>Next it will be people calling CPS to report parents for not vaccinating their kids against covid-19 and just like the woman who was berated and had visitations taken away by the judge for not wearing a mask during her custodial time with her children, many children will probably be removed from their anti-science parents, forcibly vaccinated and turned into wards of the state. Ready to work at the munitions factory, comrade.</p>
<p>Okay. That's hyperbole. But it would not surprise me.</p>

        <p>Operation warp speed has nothing to do with Covid and I’ll leave it at that. The vaccine trump spoke of to wipe out the invisible enemy also was not a shot.</p>

<p>What everyone needs to do is skip the shot, and take those freedoms back anyway.  Whatever they say you can do AFTER the shot - do it now, regardless.  </p>
<p>The jab is <strong>not FDA approved</strong>, and cannot be mandated because it's <strong>still experimental</strong>.  Placing restrictions on you based upon your vaccine status for such a product is <strong>against the Nuremburg Code.</strong></p>
