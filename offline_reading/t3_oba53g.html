    <strong>People get unreasonably angry that an absolute stranger isn't getting vaccinated</strong>
    <p><p>I'm not anti-vax in the sense of distrusting vaccines, but rather I have a terrible fear of needles. Combine that with the fact that I don't have an ounce of fear towards the stupid fucking virus and I am decidedly not getting the vaccine. </p>
<p>In my dirt-poor family the only time anyone arrived at a hospital was for child birth, as such I've never really been the pedantic type who gets doctor checkups or rushes to the hospital when they get a weird tickle in their throat. 20 odd years of relying on my immune system to work shit out on its own hasn't strayed me wrong yet, so when the this virus was being described as "cold and flu like symptoms" that primarily effects the elderly and those with prior health complications I didn't even break a sweat.</p>
<p>Over a year of Covid hasn't at all effected my quality of living other than me being forced to wear a mask in certain areas (I wasn't very social to begin with). Now that the vaccine is out I'm actually glad because that means those that want to get the needle can and I can take my mask off. But the moment people find out I'm not getting the vaccine they lose their mind.</p>
<p>Like sorry, I haven't given a fraction of a fuck about this virus for the entire duration of the pandemic, why would I suddenly start caring now that it's coming to a closing? When it was first making headlines I wasn't worried about it, and mother nature had over a year to make me regret it and yet I have remained in good health despite not taking any precautions, why would I suddenly rush to get the vaccine?</p>
<p>And yet people lose their fucking shit and they don't even know me and yet they try to command me to get the vaccine. No matter how you phrase the actual mortality rates they'll always say any number is too much. Like seriously what the fuck is wrong with people, is free will not a thing anymore?</p></p>

        <p>I long for the day when these people wake the fuck up but it’s never going to happen. It wasn’t that long ago that we all went about our lives not giving a damn who was and wasn’t vaccinated. People got vaccinated because they wanted too and they didn’t walk around demanding everyone else get the same vaccine. They didn’t have the insane belief that everyone else also had to be vaccinated in order for them to be safe.</p>

        <p>U said o.p...now thats its supposedly over why would anyone rush out to get the vaxx? </p>
<p>Survived throughout this whole ordeal without a vaxx so what's the point now?</p>
<p>These questions are based on logic and sense which have no business is this new world.</p>

        <p>Considering...
It's been going around for over a year, hospitals were never actually overwhelmed, the death rate was muuuch lower than expected, it's already everywhere - most people have probably encountered it and had no reaction whatsoever,
add to that the fact that the shot doesn't protect you against new variants (though I would argue that it doesn't do anything for the old one either)...
Yeah this makes absolutely no fucking sense. And people need to get mad to protect their ego from that realization.</p>
<p>Its weird considering a lot of my family members, who I <em>thought</em> were intelligent people have fallen for this, but the logic just bounces off of them. It's like some karmic trap that they can't escape.</p>

        <p>Thats something that I keep having to explain to people, the fact that vast quantities of people have already been exposed to the virus and their immune system brushed it off. People don't realize that the covid microbes are everywhere by this point</p>
