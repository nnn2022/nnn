    <strong>Are we biased?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m writing this with the upmost respect for everyone’s perspective. I value what each and everyone one of you has to say no matter which side you lean towards. Please tickle my curiosity here. There’s some digging I feel that needs to be done. </p>
<p>Are we biased about the information given out by COVID and lean towards anti-lockdown because of the pressures we are currently facing in today’s society? The need to be “human” and interact “normally” with one another? </p>
<p>If so, does that weigh as more important than the “physical” side effects of COVID and is it worth the risks that come with it? </p>
<p>Do we unconsciously deny the information provided to us that goes against our beliefs on whether we think we should be locked down or not? How can you tell? </p>
<p>I appreciate all and any feedback and would like to hear everyone’s opinion, I’d love to understand why everyone is choosing the side they are choosing. </p>
<p>Thanks for your time.</p></p>

        <p>There isn't a person on the planet who isn't at least a little biased on any given issue. However, we've chosen this "side" because critical thinking led us to our conclusions.</p>
<p>People who support lockdowns and such generally do it because the media, politicians, and the scientists allowed to speak say they are a good thing. No critical thinking necessary, simply do as you're told.</p>
<p>If you never delve deeper into it, you will never need to think critically and will never find reason to doubt anything you are told. You are spoon fed someone else's analysis, which also happens to be unvetted and un-scrutinized if you only watch mainstream media news sources since they generally echo each other due to having the same goals and funding sources.</p>
<p>The scrutiny is found outside of the mainstream. There is of course some questionable material out there, though there certainly is in the mainstream too. Scrutiny is critical for anything related to science though. People who scrutinize any mainstream opinion of Covid are marginalized, which detriments the scientific process greatly. </p>
<p>A critical thinker will cross-reference information from many sources though, and there is plenty of that happening on this sub that brings up legitimate questions for the mainstream narrative. This does not necessarily mean bias though, it's just an important part of the scientific process being completed elsewhere from the mainstream.</p>

        <p>Everyone is biased. It is impossible not to be. </p>
<p>The core of being a lockdown skeptic is not about being biased or unbiased; it’s about risk assessment. As a skeptic, I wholeheartedly believe with every fiber of my soul that the prevention efforts we are taking as a society are not in proportion to the true risk that coronavirus poses. I have a background in public health and have a pretty good understanding of population level policy changes, behavior theory, long term effects of poverty, isolation, and sedentary lifestyles. </p>
<p>Of course, I enjoy seeing more and more articles and publications that reaffirm my view, as does anyone else. I am willing to admit that if I had a different experience or set of circumstances, or was in a higher risk category, that I may have a different outlook (although I doubt it, but anything is possible).</p>

        <p>Everyone is.</p>
<p>I’m biased for a few ways:</p>
<p>A) I was working in Manhattan until March 13th and almost certainly was exposed before I even knew to be afraid</p>
<p>B) My personality - VERY extroverted and feeds off energy (I’ve been doing pretty poorly the last few months)</p>
<p>C) I only live with my boyfriend, and I don’t come into contact with any elderly or at-risk folk - or small children (I know they’re not at risk but my friends are losing their minds when it comes to 0.0001% chance of something happening to the children</p>
<p>D) My boyfriend’s always been very skeptical (but he was really glad we did an extra quarantine run of groceries for TP in early March)</p>
<p>E) Because I’ve been stuck at home I’ve been <em>really</em> bored and have been researching the impacts and sciences for many, many, many hours. I think I know this better than even my doctor friends at this point</p>
<p>F) If something’s going to take a cannonball to my life I’m going to know why</p>
<p>G) I’ve always been pretty politically centrist, so I don’t view things as “my team” or “your team”</p>
<p>H) I’m younger than 40, white female with no pre-existing conditions (and they would’ve come up - I’ve run 5 marathons) so I really have nothing to fear</p>

        <p>Yes I'm biased but not enough to refuse to look at the oppositions information. Since joining this sub I've pored over scientific journal after journal, many of them pro lockdown and fear mongering material. They reveal quite a lot of information that actually support our position ironically. The data says we are correct. Much of the doomer material that ends up being used for headlines are based on models and hypothetical scenarios, real world data contradicts the models findings and you can find it in the same article. It's crazy, damn near every time I look at a doomer link the headline is extremely misleading.</p>
