There's a group (or several) that doesn't appreciate the messaging we post here. A few days ago, I tried a little experiment. In the past few weeks, I was getting frustrated by posting on here and then having upvotes... then it would slide down quickly, then up, then down. I was getting no where, even when posting factual or supporting information. This kind of information previously (over several months ago) was usually very popular. My experiment was simple find the culprits on the other group and block, block, block... after a couple days of blocking. It seems my posts are generally trending up. Sadly they'll never be seen by those that could learn a thing or ten. But for new comers (and it's growing) that information will likely be useful. Thoughts? </a></p></p>
