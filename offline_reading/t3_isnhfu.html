    <strong>“Flu is killing more people than Covid19, and has been for months“. Latest ONS figures show the “pandemic” fatalities have slowed to a trickle, and lockdown has nothing to do with it.</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://off-guardian.org/2020/09/09/flu-is-killing-more-people-than-covid19-and-has-been-for-months/">https://off-guardian.org/2020/09/09/flu-is-killing-more-people-than-covid19-and-has-been-for-months/</a></p>
<p>“A report from the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/latest"><strong>UK’s Office of National Statistics (ONS)</strong></a>shows that since at least June 19th, more people in the UK have been dying of influenza than Covid19.</p>
<p>This, of course, is despite the fact that “Covid19 deaths” are incredibly vaguely defined.</p>
<p>Under UK law a person only has to test positive for the Sars-Cov-2 virus <em>at any point in the 28 days prior to their death</em> for “Covid19” to be on their death certificate, a policy which totally ignores the fact the majority of Sars-Cov-2 infections are completely symptomless (and has already <a href="https://www.dumptheguardian.com/world/2020/aug/12/coronavirus-death-toll-in-england-revised-down-by-more-than-5000"><strong>resulted in huge over-counts</strong></a>).</p>
<p>Meanwhile boring old influenza is lumbered with <em>having to actually contribute to the death</em> before being added to the death certificate. And nevertheless, for three straight months, the UK has recorded more flu deaths than Covid deaths.</p>
<p>See this graph:</p>

<p><em>Ah”</em>, some of your may be saying, <em>“this is just evidence that the lockdown, social distancing and masks have worked.”</em></p>
<p>But that is obviously not the case. Clearly, if these measures did anything to halt viral transmission, the flu deaths would have gone down as well. They have not. They are right in line with the five-year average.</p>
<p>Despite social distancing and wearing masks and hand sanitizer on every corner…the spread of the flu virus has not halted one bit in its usual annual progress through society.“</p></p>

        <p>Even Neil Ferguson, the, ahem, asshole who stuck us with the concept of Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention has said that these measure only delay deaths, not prevent them.</p>
<p>In his defense,  that's all any medicine does.  Life has a fatality rate of 100%</p>

        <p>Not really his “personal life” that was the issue.  He advocated, hard, for lockdown as the only way to control virus.  Then was repeatedly not abiding by his own mandate.  Resigned in shame because of <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/05/exclusive-government-scientist-neil-ferguson-resigns-breaking/amp/">this. </a></p>
