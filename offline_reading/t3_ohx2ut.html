        <p>It’s political slight of hand. It’s just like when they say “oil and gas subsidies” but really what they mean is tax write offs, ie. companies being allowed to keep more of their own money. </p>
<p>Any politician “creating jobs” just means they temporarily allowed us to have a bit more leash.</p>

        <p>Somewhat related - I find it interesting that there’s a labor shortage. I’ve never seen more “now hiring” signs in my life. I applied for a job recently, got an email inviting me to do a video interview within 3 hours, and got an offer on the spot.</p>
<p>Granted I have a specific skill set, but still. Normally employers bullshit you around for at least a week regardless of your qualifications - I know because I’ve been on the other side of the hiring process. I was almost taken aback (in a good way because I really wanted the job.)</p>
<p>I have to wonder if a lot of people are still milking unemployment from last year because they just don’t want to work. I know you’re supposed to be actively looking for work to receive it but the unemployment office is probably too overwhelmed to actually follow up with people about it.</p>

        <p>What are they paying you? Lower wage? Normal wage? Higher wage?<br>
Many employers are having a "Great Reset" of their own, getting rid of old employees and hiring back at lower rates.</p>
<p>I dunno what's happening in your area compared to mine, but Canadian governments are pumping even more money into businesses to subsidize hiring people back, whether they actually have work and contracts for them or not.</p>
<p>It's all a big lie, and when the bill comes due.. ouch.</p>

        <p>I suspect a lot of people are still milking unemployment because it’s been extended so much. Plus they are getting an extra $300 a week. Was recently in Northern Nevada and a lot of businesses were closed with signs in the window saying it’s due to staffing issues. Wal-Mart in Reno just had a job fair and starting wage is $20 an hour! Seems like a lot of folks are probably not struggling too bad on unemployment right now.</p>

        <p>Right? I’m in Cali, it is difficult to find a job that pays over $13 an hour (which I think is the minimum wage now). A few years ago when I was seriously looking to go back to work, most jobs I qualify for were paying $12 an hour, 30 hours a week and required a B.A! (Which I do have. But at $12 an hour, it made no sense to go back to work at the time because I would have maybe had $300 left over after paying for child care and a massive headache trying to figure out my kids transportation to and from school &amp; sports). If wal-mart here paid $20 an hour, I would absolutely work there. But they pay minimum wage here and the stores here are NASTY LOL! I went the other day and soon as I got to the front door it smelled like raw sewage. I just started looking for work again and am still not seeing anything over $15 an hour.</p>

<p>100%. We had a very rough time finding people who wanted to work during COVID. We actually lost a few employees because it was obvious they wanted that COVID unemployment gravy train. We had an employee <strong>quit</strong> and still get unemployment approved by the government. It was absolutely ridiculous.</p>

        <p>Idk what the cut off was, can’t find any online, but a majority of Americans received more in unemployment than working. Because they straight up tacked on $300-600 on to whatever you were making before. The people we have that stayed working throughout the pandemic have my upmost respect. But I know plenty of people who took that COVID unemployment route and I will forever remember them as bums.</p>

        <p>I think that many factors are turning this into the Perfect Storm, and many wise people are using those factors to better themselves.</p>
<p>To many businesses, "re-opening" didn't mean "back to normal." They cut operating hours to those most profitable. In my area, some restaurants are no longer open for lunch, and some retail stores are opening later, closing earlier, and staying closed a day or two every week. As business improves and payrolls expand, those places will respond.</p>
<p>Then there's the whole "work from home" thing. Some people found jobs that allowed them to both work and be home with their children. </p>
<p>Many people who didn't like their low-paying jobs took advantage of openings in better-paying jobs, and now those former employers are scrambling to get people to even apply to work there.</p>
<p>Fourteen- and fifteen-year-olds didn't get stimulus or unemployment benefits, so many businesses that could do so, began accepting them as employees. But eventually, the gravy train will come to a halt, and those still onboard will find that many of the best opportunities will have passed them by.</p>

        <p>No jokes here. I stand for neither side. I stand on neutral ground, for the freedoms and liberties of the people. With the evidence provided after the 2020 election I would agree that there was in fact fraud and tinkering of many sorts. I would also add that this has been a theme in at least 90% of the elections within the US. We can probably assume the fairest election was that in which George Washington was elected president, but if we are being honest with ourselves that was also more of a selection.</p>

        <p>Trump talked a good game, but I think that his leadership was at best unexceptional. He shouldn't have "renegotiated" NAFTA. He should have ended it. Same with the China trade war. No follow through, just big flash in the pan policies that he dropped as soon as they stopped getting him attention. We could have domestic microchip manufacturing capacity by now instead of being dependant on Taiwan. Instead we've got one of the world's best educated workforces bagging groceries and grooming dogs.</p>

        <p>He replaced NAFTA with the USMCA, which even Biden admitted is better.  He was tightening the screws on China, which he would have continued to do, but he was cheated out of the election.  It was a lot more than 'talk'.  Plus he was fighting most of his own establishment pretty much his entire term, and he <em>still</em> accomplished a lot.</p>

It was a problem in china then boom we're locked down, too busy with hating each other to even notice what was coming.  Not everyone, but the masses.  Notice how suddenly everything was political? Idiots continuing to wear masks so nobody thought they were Republicans?  I hope I'm wrong about this but unfortunately I wouldn't be shocked if it was true</p>

        <p>you act as if politics doesn't exist. COVID was political from the start, and despite fast-tracking a vaccine and saving many lives through early travel bans, Trump was STILL constantly scrutinized for his responses to the pandemic which ultimately cost him the election. If he had gone AWOL and ended shutdowns and pretended COVID didn't exist? He would have literally been impeached on the spot and it would have been a constant distraction, instead of him continuing to exist as the leader of our country.</p>

<p>Wrong.  Poll watchers not being allowed to observe the counting, mysterious boxes being unloaded from a truck at 4am, boxes being pulled out from under a table and counted after observers were sent home, states refusing to clean up the voter rolls, votes from people registered at addresses that they didn't live at/don't exist, etc ultimately cost him the election.</p>

        <p>Ok i dunno exactly what’s going on but… never seen as many places hiring as are hiring in my area right now… all fast food, grocery stores and restaurants have Now Hiring signs. It’s kind of wild.  ‘My guess is maybe due to the stimulus $$, ppl aren’t desperate enough to pick the shittiest jobs? </p>
<p>*i turned down a $15 an hour job i was offered in looking for one that starts at $16 or above. Maybe others are doing the same?</p>

        <p>This is equally as bad as trumps claim of creating millions of jobs. Remember "10.6 million jobs over four months". When 22 million had been lost. So the net gain was still minus 11million jobs. Both are idiots trying to portray the increase in jobs against the backdrop of the 22 million lost at the start of the pandemic as somehow "their doing". They think the American people are stupid. You're still down millions of jobs vs march 2020.</p>

        <p>You’re definitely a Russian plant-All the mod has to do is look at your comment history to see how you constantly target people with onslaught of abuse. There’s countless posts and videos all over the internet showing your sowing division playing to either the left or right for at least the last 10 years. He’s now playing us using the covid sham to gain platform.</p>
