    <strong>Do you think the truth will be exposed?</strong>
    <p><p>Do you genuinely think the truth will come out at some point? Do you think that people will realise how stupid they were to believe and comply in such a scam and overreaction? Do you think we will be able to share our thought about this all one day without being labelled as negationists and grandma killers? Do you think they will realise how little harm the virus can do to people? Seriously guys, seems like these people just learnt how infectious diseases spread. Yes, you had the chance to kill your grandma with the flu even last year and the years before, why such a big deal now? It's obvious that it's better not to infect an old person with any illness. My granpa is 98 and I worry about him getting it but just like I do everytime something is spreading. This is no different. 
I can barely live with this knowledge. I would much rather live in fear of the virus like 99% as the population (oh and survival rate lol). 
Everyone dying while being positive to covid are reported as covid death, like literally a person DROWNED in a lake whit covid and got counted as covid death! They are sending the results of swab tests never performed to people dead before 2020. They are counting as new cases everytime they test the same person to see if is still positive. They are failing to communicate that positive doesn't mean I'll and certainly doesn't mean dead in two days as long as your entire extended family. The hospitals are full because people with a slight cold are panicking and saturing the healthcare system. 
I can't do it much longer, I can't pretend this is okay for months and years. I want my life back. I want my youth back. I want to experience uni normally. I want to see my friends without them saying shit like they are afraid to exterminate their whole family because they saw me without a mask on. I want to travel and explore the world. I want to learn in a classroom and not behind a PC. I want to meet people and make friends. I want to be careless again. I want be able o breath and not be forced into a mask for 10 hours straight. I want these months of my 18/19 years old age back that I won't ever see again. They stole it from me. And won't acknowledge it is a problem. Will this ever be seen as fucked up?
Sorry for the long rant, I am just very mad I'm 19 and losing my youth over this.</p></p>

        <p>Don’t be sorry, you deserve to be mad, it’s outrageous how people have fallen for the marketing scams and been brainwashed. </p>
<p>Personally I do not believe there will ever be any truth told. That would involve too many politicians and experts and other leaders and important figures to admit they were WRONG! They could never ever do that.  </p>
<p>I feel so much of what you said! I want my life back! I want my friends back but they are all such Koolaid drinkers I’ve had to avoid them. </p>
<p>I want to be careless and travel the world! I want to go to the bar and go dancing and go to the beaches and not have to wear a god-awful face diaper! </p>
<p>I want kids like you to be reckless and wild and go to uni and interact with teachers and classmates properly using facial expresses and be in crowds having fun at events. Dancing in mosh pits with your faces mashed into each other! This nightmare we are in is intolerable!!</p>

        <p>I see the narrative has changed. Articles are being written about much better we are at treating it and how it’s much less deadly now. And worst of all, maybe masks are reducing the viral load which is helps. Absolute bollocks of course. </p>
<p>It’s always been like that. Just they’re protecting the older more now. And we know of more cases now so the CFR is reducing.</p>

        <p>I think it will, but within 5 years maybe, when we have all data available, it’ll be easy to see with such a macro sample how much harm was done in such a short amount of time, too.</p>
<p>As well, by that time we’ll have a better understanding of death rates overall, by area, population, race, gender etc and can compare better. By a certain point, it’s also possible that we could isolate the exact genetic mutation that causes it to strike some people very severely even if they’re not old or sick which will make it even more obvious how little impact it would have had on the population. </p>
<p>Richer countries and people will laugh about “oh how silly was all that!” And it will just expand the wealth/social mobility gap that much more.</p>
<p>ETA after reading your whole post OP: I lost all my good young adult years to trauma/depression and will never get an explanation or apology from the people who did it to me, either. They insist it was “for the best” and will never acknowledge how they destroyed the rest of my life, either- so I just want you to know regardless of the cause you’re not alone in that, and hopefully you’ll be able to find people and things that will be able to help you in the future. Have a great therapist and good Meds right now, and sometimes I do feel like I can be normal but you’re right, you never get that time back. Please do find help and don’t be afraid to ask if you need it either!</p>

        <p>i just want you to know that it's okay to be angry, it's okay to be angry with the people in charge. it's okay to be angry at the status quo. it's okay to want to burn it all down and smash things and scream and yell and punch something. maybe a wall? go find a wall. drywall is easy to repair.</p>
<p>it's okay to want to go out with your friends and rough house and party and enjoy your time together. it's okay to want to see your family and socialize normally. i'm sorry about your grandpa - it's not okay to treat the elderly like this.  it's okay and normal to want to communicate without a mask on. it's okay to want to live spontaneously again, without planning every second of every activity. it's okay to want to feel human again. it's okay to want to dance and listen to live music, it's okay to want to see movies, it's okay to miss sports.</p>
<p>it's okay to be angry at the stupid people who can't understand how how the risk from any virus is usually age-stratified and how risk is exacerbated by comorbidities. my god yes, some people are stupid. like, really stupid. it's okay to hope they go play in traffic. they're assholes.</p>
<p>it's okay to want to continue your education in a healthy classroom, free of security theater. it's okay to miss your teachers and classmates. it's normal and healthy and good to want to travel, to sow your wild oats, to make mistakes and learn lessons. you're a young man and the adults are robbing you of your youth. </p>
<p>it's okay to be angry at the adults - the baby boomers, some of the GenXers - for making decisions that keep them "safer" and "healthier" at your expense. at the expense of your education, of your personal growth and development, and yes, at the expense of your future earning potential and career. i'm sorry our parents and grandparents decided to take on all of this national debt at the same time they decided to lock us away for a year or more. i'm sorry that you and my children and our grandchild will be paying this off for decades, i'm sorry that selfish people over the age of 50 are making choices that will reverberate across generations.</p>
<p>and for what? did we save any lives? did we really slow the spread? did we stop the 'rona in her tracks? no. all we did was delay the inevitable. we made difficult choices even harder. we forgot about the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) or the quality of life, or death with dignity. i'm sorry that the grown ups don't want to admit that life is for the living, not worrying about death. </p>
<p>i'm sorry but the adults are afraid of dying. they are unable to make amends with their own mortality. life is 100% fatal. i'm sorry they don't know that. i'm sorry that they don't know that they can't stop death, all they can do is draw it out. how can the adults be so stupid? i am sorry they are taking out their moral shortcomings and selfish nature out on you. i'm sorry that they are selfish, there is nothing to be done about that at this point. they are selfish, they are afraid, they are weak and frail and fragile, and they don't want to admit it.</p>
<p>i'm sorry they are robbing you of the present, but don't let them take your future. time only goes one way. you have to keep going, and never let them forget that you let them have their way for xx months, and they never get to do that again. you are the master of your own future - in a few years, after you turn 26, after your brain stops growing, after you get most of your bad decisions out of the way (and you'll need to make those) - you will be held accountable for your actions. you will be responsible for those future choices. </p>
<p>never forget how you feel in this moment. never do this to another generation. never forget that you're alive now, and you don't know when that might all come to a halt. what comes next? i am sorry, i don't know - we will all find out someday. </p>
<p>keep. going. there's is only one way out, and that's through.</p>
<p>now go fuck up some drywall and steal a beer, okay? good talk.</p>

        <p>No. The biggest fear is fear of death. Even though 20 year olds willingly went to fight on Normandy, we now have 20 year olds screaming from the rooftops about masks and social distancing. It's sad. I can only thing of moving to Sweden or some other country to escape the insanity. People are so weak and it's only going to get worse.</p>

        <p>What's the truth? If a scam then why? Maybe politicians really, really care about preserving old people's lives now that public eyes are on it... and who got everyone's eyes on it are the kindest souls among us, who really didn't realize they were killing people and couldn't keep living with it.</p>

        <p>Yeah because someone's grandpa would have lived up to 150 if the covid killer hadn't taken them at such  a young age. It's about years taken from lives...and you could die at every given moment and I'm okay with that. A 86 years old can't be? I doubt that.

        <p>Grandpa didn't have his youth stolen from him. What is grandpa going to do sitting in a nursing home staring out a window barred from any contact from the people who love him the most. What can he do specifically to "change the world" in that setting? Do you think he will be inspired by being removed and isolated from those who care about him the most? </p>
<p>Who knows what this ambitious youngster will do to change life for everyone on this planet? Keeping him and others his age like him locked up limits innovation and <em>real</em> progress. Someone's grandpa is going to die sooner or later and it will be tragic, hard and difficult but we cannot continue to live like this, it's unsustainable.</p>
