        <p>Honestly I think this is one of the better things to come out of the Trump presidency, the idea of an unbiased media is starting to die out. It’s always been a joke, of course everyone has their biases in what and how they report on things but now they are starting to be honest about it.</p>

        <p>This is totally staged. Also, if COVID really were as bad as they say, we’d see people dying in their homes of it. Isn’t funny how the only people who die of COVID die in hospitals? Also, they’ve never cared about the mortality rate. They have proven that they are not trying to slow the spread, but stop it. They measure lockdown phases and mask mandates on the number of people getting COVID, not the number of deaths or hospital capacity. I’m more libertarian in the fact that I don’t like government control. Ever. I don’t care if this is the Black Plague and 1/3 of Americans are going to die. If I want to go outside, I can. It’s my choice to decide on risk vs reward, and decide my own safety.</p>

        <p>I think this is pretty great.</p>
<p>The very first thing that convinced me something was off back in late March early April was the fact that our health care systems were never even close to overwhelmed (at least here in CA). If we were shutting down to flatten the curve to protect our hospitals... Yet all the hospitals were fine... Did we really need to lockdown? What sort of"deadly pandemic" is this when there was barely anyone going to the hospital?</p>

        <p>When was the last “real” pandemic if we use those definitions?</p>
<p>Based on that criteria, the Spanish Flu was not a pandemic.  There was very much plenty of disagreement over masks by elements of the population even as medical community pushed for it; whether it was a hoax; and there was of course plenty of profiteering.</p>
<p>It seems like what is provided as “real” pandemic would be more apt to describe a zombie apocalypse scenario instead — which makes sense when the enemy is visible.  The fact that the virus is an invisible enemy creates the range of people who believes it exists and those who do not.</p>

        <p>It's a real pandemic no doubt about it. I just think they're milking it for all it's worth. I don't even think they're even consciously doing it either, it's just human nature - when you have that power, and when you're the one saving the world, you don't want it to end. It's that addictive dopamine fix. I'd call it a scamdemic rather than a plandemic, I don't believe all there was any plan or massive hidden conspiracy. It just sort of happened and events ran away with themselves, like a toxic chemical reaction between all the worst parts of human nature.</p>

        <p>This. As nations grow bigger and more diverse, as governments and corporations grow more powerful, they become inherently more corrupt and unstable. There is no "ultimate plan" aside from individual and their agendas, the pursuit of power simply becomes a runaway reaction that eventually results in a socioeconomic implosion. It all goes back to that magic number: the number of people any one person can genuinely feel compassion for. A few dozen, maybe a few hundred at most. Not thousands, millions, or billions. Even if Trump, Biden, Fauci, Zuckerberg, Bezos, etc really wanted to do right by us, they physically cannot. True leaders must know their people as friends and family.</p>

        <p>Pretty sure politicians would intimidate people, corporations would make billions, police would punish citizens through use of force, and the media would censor and fearmonger whether a pandemic is staged or real.
