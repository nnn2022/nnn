    <strong>I hope everyone here knows the real reason we have lockdowns?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm sure everyone knows, but it's always worth reiterating.</p>
<ul>
<li>The end goal is the establishment of a worldwide communist technocracy ruled by a one-world government, where money is replaced by social credit, and everyone is under 24x7 surveillance, monitoring and control. Think China on steroid.</li>
<li>To get to that stage, they have to first destroy the world economy, because no sane person is gonna accept communism while there is still a functioning economy. They also have to destroy the livelihood of all small businesses, freelancers and self-employed. They want everyone to depend on the state for handouts. Because true control is when they have you depending on the state for food.</li>
<li>So the lockdowns are designed to destroy the world economy. The additional bonus is, a few hundred million or even a billion people will die of poverty, diseases and hunger as the world economy comes to a standstill. Population control was also on their radar, all the time.</li>
<li>So, the situation will be made so desperate that people will literally beg for relief. They'll accept anything to save their family. Once we are at that stage, the hidden puppeteers will helpfully and "very reluctantly" propose that a new political and financial system is needed to save us.</li>
<li>Media will be geared up at this point to vomit out 24x7 propaganda on why the new system is so good, and how it will cure all our problems. The puppeteers may even create a whole new set of political parties to usher in this new system. Naturally, these parties will have the slogan "The other parties destroyed the world, now let us save it". And bingo, we have communism.</li>
<li>In this new system, the vast majority of the people will be dependent on the state for food, and even slightest misdemeanor will be brutally punished. Big Tech like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft will be officially watching everyone all the time. There will still be plenty of rich people and billionaires, but they will be part of the system - the elite and their hangers-on.   </li>
</ul>
<p>I'd hazard a guess is that the whole process will take around 3 years, allowing enough time for enough people to die and the rest to get sufficiently desperate.</p></p>

        <p>To explain that I'm afraid I'd need to venture out into more metaphysical territories, something that would frighten the horses, so that's best avoided unless the necessary spiritual maturity is there. I'd only point interested people to the work of Tom Montalk (<a href="https://www.montalk.net">www.montalk.net</a>) who has explained it all much better than I ever could.</p>

<p>Maybe it's because I was abused as a child, in ways not unlike what we are seeing on a global scale, so I understand why people crave the need to control others, and keep them under constant surveillance (after years of reflection on the subject). Unfortunately, most people don't "get" it, even after explaining it.</p>

        <p>You left out the final phase of culling the population. I think I'm ok with that though. It'll get rid of all the idiots who don't see what's really going on and buy into everything the media tells them. You'll be fine from the culling if you stay woke and aware of what's really happening</p>

        <p>Shield yourself from 5g. Doesn't take much to block the signal. They could also decide to crank up the power output on the transmitters. Even if 5g isn't going to be weaponized, there's a court hearing on video of tons of scientists speaking out against it and the phone companies admitting they haven't even tested it on lab rats. Not to mention the 4 elementary school kids who got cancer within 6 months of a sprint 5g tower going up right outside their school which made national news and sprint even removed the tower. A simple pocket aluminum fire blanket can shield you from it. 5g and every other microwave radiation, including wifi, is relatively harmless in small doses but it's the constant 24/7 bombardment that we've all now surrounded ourselves with that is harmful. Our bodies never get a chance to heal and recover from it. I turn off all my wireless devices while I sleep and put my phone on airplane mode. It lets your body heal overnight</p>
<p>SpaceX plans on launching 40,000 satellites in low earth orbit to broadcast 5g to every corner of the globe. Bye bye personal privacy. It's fast enough for artificial intelligence to be decentralized and live in the cloud</p>

        <p>Nah you can buy something similar to mosquito nets to drape around your bed and make it look classy and nice. The stuff is made out of fabric and blocks all radio waves. I'm not paranoid enough to drop a thousand dollars on it. I do have a professional rf meter though which picks up on everything from airport radar to wifi and 5g signals and everything in between. I just use the meter to make sure my sleeping area is getting minimal exposure to rf signals</p>

        <p>See, you may have a point, but the deeper you go the crazier you look.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I agree something is fishy - the wealthiest people in the world have become even wealthier because of all this shit. However  many businesses (airlines) have tanked horrendously because of it. Such wealthy parties gaining AND suffering leads me to believe it is just incompetence all the way down, and not some secret elite bullshittery going on.</p>

        <p>No, I get the whole "wait out and wipe out the competition" but some of the industries being affected don't have much competition other than other equally big businesses (again, I used airlines as an example).</p>
<p>Again, I'm not disagreeing with you - i am just a skeptic in these things. Like, if the argument was that China deliberately screwed over the world for their play at power, I'm fully on board. But a secret cabal of uber elites transforming the world into some technocratic communist dys/utopia seems to me more about making connections where none may be other than "governments panicked to media hype and now we are all fucked".</p>
<p>Glad to see qe had similar trains of thought, though</p>

        <p>The real question is, with your knowledge (and I'm with you in knowing this has been planned for a thousand years) what are you/we going to do about it? Protest? That's what they want and they laugh at weak protesting cunts. These people will only be stopped one way and that will never happen, so mask or no mask they will succeed unless we literally go to their mansions and erase them.</p>

<p>Imagine having absolutely no regard for the people around you in any capacity. We need security in stores to remove people who don't wear masks. Its a danger to everyone else just because you are too busy snorting pencil shavings to put on a mask when you go to walmart.</p>
