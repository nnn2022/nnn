    <strong>What happened? Was the vote really: do you hate lockdowns or Trump more?</strong>
    <p><p>Maybe it’s all the mail-in ballots, but I’m thinking about the big cities like New York, which are hollow shells of their former selves. I remember reading about businesses banding together to sue the mayor/governor to be able to reopen again. Did these same people vote for Biden? The big cities locked down harder than any rural or suburban area, so shouldn’t they be feeling the most economic pain and want to vote against the pro-lockdown candidate? Even if they actually believed in the virus, wouldn’t they still realize they just cannot afford to hide anymore and they have to learn to live with the virus? I was really surprised by how close the race is. Not because I think they suddenly like Trump, but because of lockdown fatigue and economic devastation in the big cities. Unless they’re just obsessed with getting the Biden bailout deal because they know they’re screwed without it? Even though it’s the Democrat governor who caused it in the first place.</p>
<p>I am just blown away by the big city folks’ loyalty to a party that has spent the last several months utterly destroying their economy and lives.</p></p>
