    <strong>Any Americans out there feeling down?</strong>
    <p><p>Today my state’s government issued a mask order. </p>
<p>Today I watched <a href="https://youtu.be/N_lCmBvYMRs">this</a> rendition of the national anthem with tears in my eyes. What has happened to our country? There used to be such American pride, love for the flag, such strong value for and defense of freedom.</p>
<p>Now I look around and don’t recognize my country anymore. It’s so depressing and I fear we’re witnessing the downfall of a once glorious beacon of freedom and prosperity. I fear the new normal will win.</p></p>

        <p>To be blunt, Americans spend too much time preening about how they're supposedly much better than anyone else and don't seem to notice that even if their laws are among the best when it comes to protecting liberty, laws are only as strong as the people. Legally, American society is strongly libertarian -- but culturally, it's among the most authoritarian I've encountered.  Appeal to authority, herd mentality, political tribalism, and desire to impose on others to boost the self seem endemic. Perhaps the American society is the victim of its own success. To use an analogy, you made your house so clean that your immune system atrophied.</p>

        <p>I live in California. I have come to realize I hate this state. Shutting down again, LA and SD doing classes online, and God knows what else will happen. 
I don’t mean to scare anyone here, but I think the only option for me left is to just end it all. I’ve lost so much, have no one by my side, my youth is being wasted, and no one cares. I’ve sacrificed so much, but it will never be enough. That’s why I think I’m going to end it all if things really don’t change by the end of the year.</p>

        <p>I wish I could. Problem is, I’m a student and can’t really move until after I graduate next year. And I’m terrified of fishing my degree online, and never seeing my friends again. That’s why I’ve been extremely depressed since May.</p>

        <p>I know, right? The people here are so fucking clueless when they give "Just move, lol!" as a serious piece of advice. Clearly, they've never had to move from one state to another. I did it. Not easy, not cheap. Plus future lockdowns are still possible in most states, <strong>especially</strong> Florida and Texas (I find it hilarious people keep telling this guy to head to those two states, especially given their current situations).</p>

        <p>Why do people in these subs continue to act like moving is super easy? Especially from one state to another, or even from one <em>country</em> to another? It's not, and not everyone can drop everything to leave their homes immediately. It's condescending as fuck to assume everyone is a rich millionaire who has the means and money to do this at the drop of a hat.</p>

        <p>When I was poor, I could &amp; did do this because everything I had fit in a car. Granted, I did have month-to-month leases, but I’m not sure why it’s condescending. When we’re talking about moving from California to a place like Florida, the savings from the rent differential is huge.</p>

        <p>Because, again, not everyone can just drop everything to go live month to month in a car or shitty room/apartment. Trust me, I did that years ago, out of necessity, and it was not very fun either. And people with jobs and/or families can't just throw everything away on a whim either.</p>

        <p>Yes, tell him to move to Florida, where there's still restrictions and DeSantis closing stuff down (thus a lockdown is a distinct possibility), that will <em>surely</em> quell his concerns about lockdown. For real, you guys are in such denial about Florida, actin like it's this Freedomland when it isn't (that, and FL has other problems aside from lockdown, I say that as a former Floridian).</p>

        <p>There are real tangible benefits in crossing state lines... especially when the originating state is California. I’ve lived in 12 states at all income levels.  </p>
<p>I’m sorry you have had a bad moving experience, but I haven’t. I’m ready to give advice to make a move a success no matter the income level. I hope you can examine in your heart why you feel compelled to discourage others.</p>

        <p>Look at your prior posts in this thread. You did not bring up “don’t be rash” which would have been perfectly valid advice - and not too late to give that advice, btw. </p>

<p>Because people like you are acting like moving is easy, and that anyone can just pick up, and leave in the snap of fingers practically. Your first fucking comment to this guy was this:</p>
<p>&rt; If your courses are online anyway, why not just move?</p>
<p>Implying anyone can just move that easily, and acting like it's a no-brainer. Then you wrote about your own anecdote:</p>
<p>&rt; When I was poor, I could &amp; did do this because everything I had fit in a car. Granted, I did have month-to-month leases, but I’m not sure why it’s condescending. </p>
<p>Again, you act like anyone and everyone can just do this.</p>
<p>On my other comment:</p>
<p>&rt; It's condescending as fuck to assume everyone is a rich millionaire who has the means and money to do this at the drop of a hat.</p>
<p>Because you and others here act like moving is super simple, and doesn't cost anything. Really, only rich people can just pick up and move all their stuff and their families with such ease, and no real concern for jobs, home, etc. Moving costs a ton of money unless you're a hipster that's willing to live in a car or rooms for rent with minimal posessions. </p>
<p>For real, I'd love for you and other people suggesting these moves to post at /r/personalfinance and /r/homeowners or other living/finance subs that you plan to drop everything, move from California to Florida (or Texas or other cross country state), on a complete whim without any actual planning or money. Watch those guys shred that post to pieces.</p>

        <p>First of all, yet again, moving is not fucking easy. Most people can't just leave everything behind them to re-locate. It also takes a lot of time and money and preparation to move, even within a state, so moving from one state to another or another country is costly, and a lot of <strong>work</strong> to get done.</p>
<p>Second of all, I'd say many states have the potential to lockdown again. Someone suggested this guy move to Florida, which I find laughable. DeSantis already closed down bars and other indoor venues recently, and he locked down the state once, so I think the potential is there for him to do it again. Before the DeSantis worshippers come out to shit on me with "But he promised to never ever lockdown again!", yeah, so did Newsom. </p>
<p>But most of all, the lockdowns are going to affect everyone, even if it isn't going on in  your state. I'm sure people in South Dakota, which never locked down at all, would still feel the economic and other ramifications, at least to some extent, because the consequences of these lockdowns will be felt by all eventually, because that's how tied in the economy is to our lives.</p>

        <p>I’m not sure why you feel the need to swear and insult people. Again, nobody said it would be easy for him to move. Of course moving is a huge undertaking. But it’s not impossible and if that’s what may help restore mental health for this person, I stand by the idea. Preparing and planning to move may even give this person a positive project and something to look forward to. Sometimes big life changes can be exciting, as they represent a hope and adventure. Additionally, I predict that MANY people will flee California; in fact I’m positive the exodus has already begun.</p>

        <p>It may not restore his mental health. Moving is actually one of the most stressful life events a person can go through. I can't believe how many Redditors act like moving is a piece of cake, and encourage blindly uprooting their lives like this. And again, sure, many people can and probably will do just that, move from Cali to Texas or Florida, doesn't mean everything will be magically fixed, and I wouldn't be surprised if either or both of those states lockdown again or have more restrictions imposed on their populace.</p>

        <p>As someone who has been suicidal, my advice to him is to not make rash decisions on a whim. Because it can potentially make matters worse. People act impulsively in attempts to make themselves feel good, and it often backfires. If he wants to move, he needs to have the money, a job and new home lined up, a means to move his stuff across state lines, research wherever he moves to thoroughly, etc. But even then, moving just because of the lockdowns is something to be wary of right now, especially since  this is something affecting the entire country. He may need other, more specific treatments to help him through his depression, because moving may not even solve his problems, and may exacerbate his distress during this time. But sure, have a nice day as well.</p>

        <p>I sympathize with you and with him. I won't lie. The situation is still bleak. However, I urge you both to not make rash decisions, this includes suicide. We need to hang in there, and try to keep fighting in whatever way we can. I wish I could give better advice on how to fix this, but there just isn't an easy solution right now. Living through this is tough, and exhausting, and a test of just how much shit we can put up with.

        <p>I always thought if I ever felt that way I might as well do something drastic. And if your main problem is the state you live in, what's a move across the country compared to ending it all? A hundred bucks to get somewhere else, and go bankrupt if you have to. Worth a shot, IMO. A lot can change. Catching a bus to Idaho, South Dakota, or Wisconsin and roughing it could be worth it.</p>

        <p>Very down. Didn’t even get out of bed today. Just slept the whole day because sometimes sleep is better than reading all of the news. </p>
<p>The only reason I got up is because my mother had a piece of chocolate cake for me. The conversation while I got it went like this:</p>
<p>1: you got up for chocolate cake.
2 (me): yeah, because it’s the one good thing that happened to me today.
1: oh stop it, at least you’re alive. 
2: yeah, I’m alive not living my life.
1: do you know how many people are sick and dying?
2: do you know how many of those people actually got to live their lives? Most of them?
3 (another family member): not all of them. An 11 year old died. 
2: that’s why I said most. </p>
<p>Of course, they’re in the medical field so any other opinion besides being pro- lockdown and pro-masks is wrong. I’m losing hope I can ever truly get the career I hope for and create the family I always wanted (always wanted four little ones, especially wanted a girl that I would name after my great-grandmother). I’m on the same boat as a lot of people. I’m willing to wait one more year. But if things don’t change or even get worse, I personally don’t see a reason to stay alive.</p>
<p>Purpose in life is a major chunk of what makes life worth living. Purpose for a lot of people has taken a major hit. If I can’t recover my purpose and not live it, and am instead resorted to just existing behind a mask for the rest of my life, I don’t want it.</p>

        <p>People who don’t suffer from depression really don’t understand how saying “At least you’re alive, other people are dying,” doesn’t help. At least know that other people feel the same way. I don’t want to live the rest of my life being suffocated by a mask either. If I didn’t have my husband and baby I don’t think I’d be able to make it through this. I hope it gets better though.</p>

        <p>This is the problem, they are keeping us down, taking away our freedoms and people are depressed. Two weeks has turned into 4 months, with no end in sight. Just as soon as they open the door a tiny crack, they turn around and slam it in our faces. Because we can’t “behave”. If we don’t allow herd immunity to happen, this could go on forever. No thank you.</p>

        <p>People will probably laugh at my example, but take Disney's Cinderella. The wicked stepmother made it very clear that if Cinderella wanted to attend the ball, she had to finish her chores and find a dress to wear. Cinderella completed both tasks, but then her stepsisters and stepmother ruin the dress as an "excuse" to both humiliate her, and also deny her the chance to attend the ball. This is just like what's happening right now. Abusive people do stuff like this all the time, anything you do is never good enough to them, and they will wreck you anyhow.</p>

        <p>I’m in IL. Most of my friends are pro mask. I’m really not doing well with the lockdown. I’m extremely extroverted. Ironically, I’m so angry about the lockdown farce that everyone approves of that I feel like ghosting them all because they do not care about mental health.

        <p>I was a kid in the 90s in the Midwestern US. And it was a fucking fairytale. And my parents warned me forever about people who didn’t want any human beings to be as happy and prosperous as we were and they would do everything to take it away.</p>
<p>And we’re here now.</p>
<p>I want my life back. I want a reason to work hard back. I want breaks from work without scrutiny back. I want concerts and not caring about walking down a street and festivals and travel back. I wanted so badly to be dead before this happened to the world. I didn’t want to fucking be here to see things collapse. Sometimes I worry that people will start condemning me for even looking back on happy memories. I don’t want to forget what freedom was like. I’m so afraid I’ll never ever have that back. I’ve lost so much and so many people I thought I knew. This is crushing me in ways I didn’t expect to experience in this lifetime. And I’m so goddamn angry and bitter to boot. I was independent. I’ve never lived off the government. I don’t want a fucking UBI or welfare or handouts. I want to work and then enjoy the fruits of my labor. I want to not care or have to think about what anyone will think about me doing NORMAL THINGS. I don’t want to sneak around to see people. I don’t want to hide how I really feel because it’s taboo. How anyone could accept this is just beyond insanity. I feel like I fell into an alternate universe.</p>

        <p>Yes.  I am from California and I fear that this state is headed towards an irreversible depression because our government acts on fear and greed and nothing else.   It's easy to shut down everything at a whim's notice but to not pay attention to the long term effects plus having such an inadequate system where people can not get assistance because bills still have to be paid.  Why is there no news over treatment for COVID?   I think that we are being used as pawns for petty political gains.  There really is no leadership in this country, anywhere.  Added to all the other problems that are not getting addressed,  I am doubtful that the United States will be around within five years.</p>

        <p>My province mandated indoors as well, but only in public shops, and it hasn't crept outdoors yet thankfully. As a result I'm now refusing to spend my money at any local stores at all, and doing grocery delivery. Poor them.  I do miss seeing the regular employees at my stores though. </p>
<p>You'll know that people were rebelling against this btw if they weren't wearing masks before it was mandated. As all the health officials in every North American city keep stating, they're a "symbol"; oh yes, I certainly do believe they are a symbol at that, just not one of fighting the coronavirus.  I'm sure you have also done the same reading and considered the same rationale tests as I have with respect to masks and that it is not a knee jerk reaction or being "anti mask" like some people will say. Given the lack of benefit it really is a severe imposition on freedom of expression against this ridiculous charade. </p>
<p>So you could fight it like I am, by cutting off spending, or participate with a protest mask of some sort.</p>

        <p>Remember September 2001 and its aftermath, when Americans flocked to give away their and others' liberties because terrorism? Support the restrictive, authoritarian, warmongering meaures or you're a terrorist sympathiser! Now they flock to give away what's left because otherwise you're a plague-bearer, selfish and unclean and a danger to the group. And, I'm sorry to say it, but American culture is viciously hyper-competitive, and people seem to seize upon any opportunity to gain status by condemning someone else. Americans, I think, will absolutely report their neighbours for not following restrictive rules. Phrases like "your non-mass-wearing ass" and words such as "douche" and "-tard" will, I assume, be used.</p>

        <p>We've had a mask mandate all along, but people weren't obeying enough. The new mandate is encouraging in a way because it means lots of Michiganders were resisting the old one. </p>
<p>I went out to my usual haunts yesterday, and new signs were up at the doors, but nobody batted an eye when I waltzed in mask-free. My spouse went to Walmart and there was a guy at the door checking masks but he was nice and smiled when told "I'm sorry, I can't medically tolerate one". </p>
<p>This whole thing is psychological: if we get demoralized, they win. Put the emotional energy into resistance instead. Think about our forebears who struggled through extreme difficulty and deprivation and prevailed against all odds. Did the Pioneers get all depressed and give up when they were alone in the wilderness, contending against starvation and all the brutal forces of nature? No they did not, and that's why Americans exist as a people. We can do this. Dig down deep and find that pure, stubborn resolve. We've got to look these communist nazi-bastards in the eye and say: Hell no, come and make me.</p>

        <p>I went to Fort Myers Beach, Fl for the 4th of July and there were all these people on boats displaying the American flag. The city outlawed fireworks for the 4th, and there was this amazing fireworks display. It was a great thing to see. There are a few patriots still around. I’ve always been a Democrat, but the level of disdain that my party has for our country and personal liberties has put me off so much lately. Some of the trolls have called me a “sociopath” and a “narcissist,” just because I have doubts about these totalitarian measures. I’m neither. Just want what’s best for our country, and where I stand, that means lifting the arbitrary rules and letting people live their lives. You all are lovely, and an example that hope is not lost.</p>

        <p>our american pride is what needs to be checked, since youth it is instilled in us to 'defend' our nation, respect the flag, and why is this taught to us in school and not from our parents?  it is to make a patriotic nation that will be willing to die for its nation no questions asked. our public education system is based off the Prussian( or german) model,  remember how willing those germans were to defend the homeland, commit countless atrocities , and all for what? pride of their homeland. so how about we dont go the same route as brainwashed nazi youth.</p>

        <p>I don’t know why you’re getting downvoted. If anything this year has brought out the inner Nazi in a lot of people. And you’re right our education system is very authoritarian and we’ve raised generations of people who do as they’re told by the mainstream media and never question anything. Although I think OP is just pointing out how much more freedoms we used to have as Americans. Think of how much we’ve lost since Whitney Houston sang the national anthem.</p>

        <p>ya, knowing history sure is a bummer isnt it?</p>
<p>edit. since im sure you wont educate yourself on the topic, here ya go, notice anything familiar? ....</p>
<p>That system was characterized by compulsory attendance, teacher colleges, standardized national tests, national age-graded curriculum, compulsory kindergarten, the fragmenting of concepts into separate subjects with fixed periods of study, and the state ultimately asserting a superior claim to the child over the rights of the parents. This was a radical departure in methodology and content from the successful traditional forms of education in America.</p>
<p>The Prussian mind, which carried the day, held a clear idea of what centralized schooling should deliver: 1) Obedient soldiers to the army; 2) Obedient workers for mines, factories, and farms; 3) Well-subordinated civil servants, trained in their function; 4) Well-subordinated clerks for industry; 5) Citizens who thought alike on most issues; 6) National uniformity in thought, word, and deed.</p>
<p>The area of individual volition for commoners was severely foreclosed by Prussian psychological training procedures drawn from the experience of animal husbandry and equestrian training, and also taken from past military experience.</p>
<p>https://www.forcedschool.com/post/69947261758/the-prussian-model</p>
<p>i highly recommend learning about Edward Bernays as well, "master of public relations" whos uncle was Sigmund Freud and was frequently used to help in changing the publics opinions. long story short, he is why you consume, he is why you think you have freedom, he is why your decisions are made for you, but foolishly you think they are you own.</p>
<p>“No serious sociologist any longer believes that the voice of the people expresses any divine or specially wise and lofty idea. The voice of the people expresses the mind of the people, and that mind is made up for it by the group leaders in whom it believes and by those persons who understand the manipulation of public opinion. It is composed of inherited prejudices and symbols and cliches and verbal formulas supplied to them by the leaders.”
― Edward L. Bernays, Propaganda</p>

<p>Sure. I am completely comfortable riding a bus with no mask, just like I walk outside without one. And would go into a business without one, if I wasn't mandated in my state.</p>

        <p>It's been shown to reduce the effluvia coming out of a person's mouth and into the air.  People are getting this virus through contact with that air, so I'm not finding any downside to wearing a mask to provide whatever level of protection it can.

        <p>Because many of us actually looked into the science of whether masks stop people from getting infected with viruses and found out they don't. You know, locked at home for months on end with nothing to do but research why.</p>
<p>Because many of us who have been paying attention heard the "health officials" say masks won't prevent us getting the virus; then heard them say masks will prevent us from getting the virus.</p>
<p>Because many of us understand the English language, and when we read statements from the CDC, NIH, Mayo clinic, etc. that say "there may be no evidence that masks prevent the spread of viruses but you should wear one just to be safe" we knew it was all bullshit.</p>
<p>Because many of us know, deep in our guts, that forcing people to wear masks has nothing to do with preventing us getting a virus, and everything to do with government exerting control over us.</p>

<p>Apparently masks only work on the exhale and not the inhale? Is that your point? It stops the virus from leaving my face, but doesn't stop it from being inhaled through the mask?</p>
<p>It "might" help? But based on that logic, it might not help. </p>
<p>What sized droplets, and don't say "large" because that's not a size, that's a qualitative opinion. And yes, they have machines that can measure the size of airborne droplets. So what size?</p>
<p>What composition? Saliva? How about saliva mixed with the Coke I just drank? Phlem? What size phlegm droplets?</p>
<p>Any homemade mask, or does it have to be a particular kind of fiber? What kind, cotton, wool, nylon, lycra? What weight of fabric? Are you a multi-layer advocate? How long of a wear until it become ineffective and soaked with these "large" droplets? An hour? A week? Or does being soaked with droplets make it work better?</p>
<p>What's the effect on the wearer who is apparently constantly inhaling through these "large" droplets that are trapped in the mask?</p>
<p>I do this for a living, want me to keep going?</p>
<p>Take your idiocy and idiotic made up science somewhere else. Tyrant.</p>

        <p>I ride buses constantly and most people wear masks though some pull them down when on the bus which makes no sense.  If I'm across the aisle and some dude is coughing without a mask, I sure as hell don't want nothing covering my face at this moment.</p>

        <p>Why do you want to give the police MORE power and MORE frivolous laws to bust people's jaws in for?</p>
<p>We should be going the other way and getting rid of excess laws.</p>
<p>Now you've got your new law and you're going to find out how nearly impossible it is to remove it. Careful what you wish for.</p>
