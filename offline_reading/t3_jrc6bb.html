    <strong>And the bailouts begin. The airlines are getting taxpayer money - to "compensate" them for having to actually refund customers who didn't get to travel because of the 'Rona!!!</strong>
    <p><p>The arrogance and entitlement of these bastards is off the charts. Cancel traveler's flights due to the 'Rona and then try to avoid refunding their money. When forced to do so, cry to the government about the money you "lost", and demand a taxpayer bailout!</p>
<p>It's like "compensating" a thief because he got caught stealing a car, and it was returned to the owner!</p>
<p>I wonder what business will be next to belly up to the trough.</p>

        <p>To be fair they were shut down. If they weren’t allowed to fly anywhere and people have been banned and scared into staying home, how exactly are they supposed to survive?</p>

        <p>- Maybe by trying to encouraging customers to come back by treating them like human fucking beings instead of like cattle, instead of using Corona as an excuse to double down on their asshattery.</p>
<p>- Maybe by hiring stewardesses that aren't nasty, 300 pound lard-asses who act like you've asked them to storm the beaches of Normandy when you request a glass of water.</p>
<p>- Maybe by operating like any other business, where if you don't provide me the service I paid for, you give me my damned money back.</p>
<p>- Maybe by stopping the hypocrisy of forcing passengers to mask up while seating them cheek by jowl.</p>
<p><em>- Most of all... Maybe by not just rolling over and accepting the government's bullshit Corona edicts. If they are powerful enough to lobby for tax dollars now, they were powerful enough then to fight against Corona-madness.</em></p>
<p>I say, let them die. Maybe the free market will produce a new generation of carriers that actually act like their customers matter. If my airline ticket costs 30% more, so be it.</p>

        <p>I agree about the refunds, if the flight didn’t fly, they deserve money, not vouchers. Their customer service can suck, I think in a normal market no bailouts should be given to them, you’re right, they need to earn customers and if they don’t then they will be replaced by airlines that do. </p>
<p>Problem is they are not struggling because of their customer service, it’s because of the doomers in government, health care, and media who have forced them down. Their mask stance is the only way they’ve been allowed to fly again, so I get why they’re doing it even if I don’t believe people should be forced to wear one. The government regulates the air industry in major ways so that them refusing to follow orders is not possible. They literally would be shut down and grounded, so then they’d be gone anyways. I’m as anti mask anti doomer as anybody, but destroying the air industry is not an answer</p>

        <p>I'm with you as someone who travels alot. The post covid behavior is appalling and I told my husband from now on I'll just drive to places I would've flown before (within driving distance) frontier airlines are the worst and screwed us the worst. Aer lingus took 4 mths to refund us. American treats people like cattle. The attendants that I've seen were so condescending. Traveling used to be fun it's god awful now.</p>

        <p>Yes go under, then when you want to fly somewhere you can’t because there’s no flights, or the ones that are available are super expensive because there’s more demand then flights available. Airlines can be a pain in the ass and do annoying crap, but literally shutting them down for a year makes it necessary to help them bridge the gap.</p>

        <p>Fight it how? Force people to fly? Have their planes impounded for illegally landing? The airlines didn’t shut down voluntarily, they were shut down by the government and are still struggling because of media fear porn. The entire airline/cruise/theme park/hotel/travel industry wants this shit stopped, putting them all out of business won’t do anything but keep us in a “new normal” where we can’t travel because there’s nowhere to go and nowhere to get there.</p>

        <p>I understand your reasoning. I really do. But I can't agree with it. And by traveling under the "New Normal" rules, you will ensure they don't go away.</p>
<p>All of these businesses have been gouging customers for years, all while providing less, and worse, service for our dollars. Meanwhile they hide behind the government's skirts to protect them from customer pushback.</p>
<p>If these industries want people to come back, t<em>hey need to act like it.</em></p>
<p>They are hurting, and the consumer has the whip hand for a change - I say we use it to our advantage.</p>

        <p>One thing I’m doing is focusing on traveling to destinations who aren’t going overboard. States like South Dakota and Florida. I drive if I can, haven’t actually flown since this started but am not afraid to. Am going to Mexico in January. The Dominican is another good place. I’ll have to suck it up on the flight and wear one because I want the sun. But you better believe I’ll push the food and drink exception to it’s absurdity.</p>
<p>Hawaii is being ridiculous so fuck them. Same with California, New York, etc... those places I’ll likely avoid for a long time because of this.</p>
<p>I get your position too, I just love traveling too much to want the airlines to disappear and make our lives even more dull.</p>
