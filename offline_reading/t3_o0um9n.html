    <strong>Dealing with vax side effects advice</strong>
    <p><p>Update:  Took her to urgent care yesterday bc she was having a lot of difficulty breathing. They did ekg and chest x ray and said it was concerning and go to ER. Went to ER where they said EKG and chest xray were good. Her oxygen levels were low though, routinely between 88 and 92. They did a bunch of blood work and admitted her overnight. She got IV steroids a few times and breathing treatments. Right now she's better than when I took her in but clearly not back to normal. Waiting on more blood tests and likely released today with steroids and inhaler.  I'm assuming she'll follow up with a pulmonologist when she gets back home, she's visiting us from out of state now. </p>
<p>So basically no explanation for why it's happening. Just inflammation of airways and treat symptoms. I hope to get a chance to talk to her doctor there and make sure they're reporting to VAERS. The force is strong in that hospital network though so I may need to look into how an individual does a VAERS report. A nurse told me unironically that the flu had dissapeared this past year bc of masks last night. Also did the mandatory covid test but assured me they're all coming back negative nowadays bc everyone has been vaccinated. And of course he has admitted 10 patients with pneumonia these past 2 weeks bc illness has suddenly returned. </p>
<hr>
<p>Original post:</p>
<p>My mom got vaccinated 2.5 weeks ago and now she's coughing and wheezing like crazy. </p>
<p>I've seen someone post some herbal remedies and possibly other medications to help with this. Does anyone remember where to find that? She already has an albuterol inhaler but she still sounds like crap.</p>
<p>Edit:  I may have made it seem worse than it is. She's not hospital level sick, she's a nurse and she'd tell me if she needed to go in. She just sounds like shit. I will tell her to report to VAERS tho.</p></p>

        <p>The best thing is to get in touch with her doctor and tell them about her situation sooner rather than later. Those remedies were probably mentioned to beef up the immune system and protect against shedding. Better to try to get in front of any possible complications now and not let it get worse.</p>

        <p>I found the following information for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Drink <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/no8i3c/pine_needle_tea/"><strong>Pine Needle Tea</strong></a>, which is to help not have the vaccine's spike proteins connect to you. I think you have to drink a lot prior to your shot. The actual article is called "Possible Antidote for the V-Serum and the Current Spike Protein Contagion": https://archives.simplelists.com/nfu/msg/16539359/?fbclid=IwAR267I-dhVAygtNCur1yOmxvpibUUurjb0Q_saT4GQUUUpf73wPOg3dTK5Y</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There was this post about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/nq292a/i_got_my_2nd_vaccine_saturday_and_regret_it/h09fm15/?context=3"><strong>drinking licorice root tea</strong></a> prior or after your shot, so that the spike protein from binding to the ACE2 receptor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That same poster in the 2nd bullet point also provided <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/nq292a/i_got_my_2nd_vaccine_saturday_and_regret_it/h0fyjar/?context=3"><strong>another post with medical links</strong></a> about how licorice root tea helps mitigate the damage caused by the covid vaccines. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also read about taking Colloidal Silver to help mitigate the vaccine's effects (can't recall if you have to take it before or after). </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm so sorry your mom is coughing badly. I hope she makes a full recovery. I find at times like this praying really helps. Please let us know if she gets better. I pray for her and for you. üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª</p>

        <p>I was recommended boron supplements.  Most people are deficient in it and it helps regulate mRNA expression of extra-cellular proteins.  Also Ivermectin prevents the spike protein from binding to the ACE2 receptors on your bodies cells, there by protecting them and preventing thrombosis issues.   If I were you I'd highly encourage her to take both.</p>

        <p>Aspirin.  Most of the problems with COVID (and the vaccines) are clotting caused by the spike proteins binding to cells/antibodies.  Aspirin helps reduce clotting.</p>
<p>Budesonide inhalers seem to be effective at limiting COVID based inflammation (which I think is pathologically similar to vaccine inflammation as it is caused by the spike protein.)</p>
