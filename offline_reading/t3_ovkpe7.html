    <strong>The only comments worth reading now are hidden, downvoted, and sorted my controversial</strong>
    <p><p>I first started using Reddit when it really was "the front page of the internet".</p>
<p>I was here when the downvote count was still shown. I was here when "organic marketing" wasn't a thought, when targeted advertising was first being discussed, when a "bot" was something only referred to in Counter Strike.</p>
<p>I am so sick of the state of the world, the way information is being manipulated before my eyes in real time...</p>
<p>I went into marketing believing I would better understand the human psych, how to better understand the wants of my fellow man to better serve them the information they wanted but couldn't access...</p>
<p>What the fuck have we become?</p>
<p>I came here to not talk about Covid, the vax... None of that. </p>
<p>I guess I came to leave one comment that will ban me from multiple subs...</p>
<p>For the simple fact that I stand with this sub for calling out the massive censorship taking place on the one platform I grew up with founded on the belief that </p>
<p>"all censorship should be deplored"</p>
<p>I'll also leave one more quote from Aaron</p>
<p>"Think deeply about things. 
Don't just go along because that's the way things are or that's what your friends say. 
Consider the effects, consider the alternatives, but most importantly, just think."</p></p>

        <p>Reddit died a long time ago, free thinkers are on the image boards (4chan, 8chan, etc.) and alt-tech platforms (Odysee, Bitchute, Gab, telegram).</p>
<p>Any wrong-think here = instant ban from 10000 other subs you don't even know existed.</p>
<p>It's still good for tech-related subjects however.</p>

        <p>While I agree entirely and use multiple platforms you've listed - isn't it odd we still find ourselves here?</p>
<p>Is it a glimmer of hope we can phoenix down this platform and somehow revive it to the level of discussion we once had?</p>

<p>Reddit was doomed to fail in the end due to the up/downvote system creating tribalism and echo-chambers, that and admins/mods with an agenda flat out forcing the discourse.</p>

        <p>Same. It‚Äôs nice to watch people wake up on here, but to your initial point: the people that wake up are hidden behind ‚ÄúDeleted‚Äù or downvoted comments that require you to sort by controversial. Reddit loathes the awakening and so they suppress it.</p>

<p><strong>Growing up, I slowly had this process of realizing that all the things around me that people had told me were just the natural way things were, the way things always would be, they weren‚Äôt natural at all. They were things that could be changed, and they were things that, more importantly, were wrong and should change, and once I realized that, there was really no going back.</strong></p>

        <p>Look at it this way, at least you realize what's going on and you see it. Look at all the millions of people who are absolutely clueless and believing everything they see and hear. Can you imagine if you were that lost? Because a lot of people are and they are living in complete alternate realities right now!</p>

        <p>I believe we all are manipulated... every day in fact - exponentially now, in terms our reliance on the internet as our source of truth.</p>
<p>If I were to place blame on who I believe is misinformed, I myself would be a hypocrite.</p>
<p>My N=1 though, as we are to believe in science... That being the "scientific method"... </p>
<p>We are only in a pandemic when we choose to believe the information fed to us through media instead of our own personal, every day experiences... </p>
<p>In my own, personal experiences in the US - I see an obesity pandemic, an opiate pandemic, etc. I can see these issues first hand.</p>
<p>Yet, I don't see the same outcry for change the way I'm seeing for Covid. </p>
<p>I really didn't want to speak to that, but more the manipulation of the flow of information and mass censorship of discussion has brought me here.</p>

        <p>One of the biggest problems I see in the world right now is that people are not being taught how to think they're being taught what to think. From every Source. They're not being taught how to take in information and look closely at it and research things and come to your own conclusions. Technology has accelerated a lot of this, people are hypnotized by their electronic devices. This has a lot to do with the power the information has over people.</p>

        <p>We are now bombarded with information everyday in a way no one could fathom... </p>
<p>We used to rely on instincts, "tried and true" methods of survival.</p>
<p>I wanted to leave you something interesting I learned while studying our variation of "marketing" we use today (manipulation). </p>
<p>*The reptilian brain, the oldest part of our brain, located below the limbic system, is evolutionarily programmed to fulfill 3 functions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>recognize danger</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>detect hunger</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>recognize the opportunity for procreation</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The reptilian brain is a kind of filter that passes marketing messages to the emotional part of our brain (limbic system) and rational part (neocortex)*</p>
<p>A thorough, deeper look into how heavily this has been automated via big data and modern tech will only make you question everything.</p>
<p>I once believed I was immune to information propaganda, but it's now inserted so subtly into every crevice of our lives it makes you sick how easy it is to be unknowingly influenced.</p>
