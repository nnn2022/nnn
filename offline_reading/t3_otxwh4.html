    <strong>A Public Health Proposal</strong>
    <p><p>Why doesn't the government do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide people who want one with N95s and goggles</li>
<li>Provide training sessions to properly fit these N95s and how to correctly use them</li>
<li>Provide vouchers for N95s and goggles</li>
</ul>
<p>This way, instead of pressuring society to uniformly restrict themselves to protect others, those who need and want protection can PROTECT THEMSELVES. Since there seems to be a great deal of immunocompromised people out there, this program will allow them to mitigate their risk without having to shame and manipulate healthy and unwilling people into compliance.</p>
<p>I'm serious about this proposal. I have a master's in public health (which I am embarrassed to admit now since public health has been made a mockery of) but I'm pretty sure a 10 year old could think of this.</p>
<p>Give the people the tools and education and let them take care of themselves.</p></p>

        <p>This is not a dig, but this is not how the politics of control works. Governments do not operate for the “good of the people” they operate for the “good of the government” they are self servicing institutions.</p>

        <p>Oh, I'm well aware. It's just so curiously amusing that myself, a lowly peasant, can think up a pretty simple public health education program that could empower people to safeguard their own health instead of continuing to handicap society. Someone much smarter and more important than me must have considered this, I'm sure. Yet they'd rather cry on TV about impending doom and yell and scream about vaccines.</p>

        <p>Give the people the tools and education and let them take care of themselves.</p>
<p>Like the previous commenter said the government does not exist to benefit the people. IF you haven't read 1984 already its a great read for this modern-day especially the chapters on the theory of oligarchical collectivism it touches on this idea.</p>
<p>The reason education like this is so rigidly controlled is that it is what keeps the ppl where they are .</p>
<p>let's say we lived in a place where income was more spread out gonna use an example from the book let's say a place where people having their own private plane was not unfounded and unheard of and it was a relatively common thing, the government would have a very hard time controlling the people because it is not via money.</p>
<p>Education is really the same thing one of the main reasons they dont do that with it is because if more people were educated to the facts of how our countries work all around the world but north American specifically they would start to think more collectively that maybe we do not need this specialized class of people that get to decide everything for us</p>
<p>Carlin also said this in stand-up essentially education is shit because that is what they want it to be.</p>
<p>also read media control by Noam Chomsky they go well together also Noam Chomsky has a great video about public schools being indoctrination centres about 6 min long(I dont agree with everything Noam says but I can appreciate a lot of it)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>again read the books if u haven't its better than reading weird points my brian remembers its hard to relay info like this without butchering it its put down well in the book</p>

        <p>That's what l was saying from the beginning! I used to be a pharmacist but l quit. Forcing people to wear masks is NOT effective! You need the right kind of mask which is expensive and you need to use it properly otherwise it's just an environmental disaster. Useless diapers are being thrown everywhere.</p>
<p>In the beginning of this l used to serve patients who weren't wearing a mask and l got trouble from the boss. Too bad...l don't wanna work in that place or this shit industry anymore anyways.</p>
