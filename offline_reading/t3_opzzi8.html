    <strong>Friday Good News</strong>
    <p><p>Good morning brothers and sisters! I hope y'all are doing well! If you have any prayer requests please let me know. I'm happy to pray for you!</p>
<p>Psalms 119:9-16 (KJV)  Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word.
With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments.
Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.
Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes.
With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.
I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches.
I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways.
I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word.</p>
<p>Most kind Heavenly Father, we humbly come before You with thanksgiving in our hearts for all your many blessings, especially Your Son Jesus dying on the cross that we can be forgiven of our sins. Please help us to heed Your word always. Let us seek you with our whole hearts. Please be with all the brothers and sisters that endure persecution for Your sake. In Jesus Name we humbly ask, Amen.</p></p>
