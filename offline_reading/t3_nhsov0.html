    <strong>Mask Requirements are in Violation of Federal Law</strong>
    <p><h1>Title 21 U.S. Code § 360bbb-3 ((e)(1)(A)(ii)(III))</h1>
<p>(e) Conditions of Authorization</p>
<p>(1) Unapproved Product</p>
<p>(A) Required Conditions</p>
<p>With respect to the <strong>emergency use</strong> of an <strong>unapproved product</strong>, the Secretary, to the extent practicable given the applicable circumstances described in subsection (b)(1), shall, for a person who carries out any activity for which the authorization is issued, establish such conditions on an authorization under this section as the Secretary finds necessary or appropriate to protect the public health, including the following:</p>
<p>(ii) Appropriate conditions designed to ensure that individuals to whom the "product" is administered are informed-</p>
<p>(III) <strong>of the option to</strong> <strong>accept or refuse</strong> <strong>administration of the "product"</strong>, of the consequences, if any, of refusing administration of the "product", and of the alternatives to the product that are available and of their benefits and risks.</p>
<h1>Title 21 U.S. Code § 360bbb-3 ((a)(4)(C))</h1>
<p>(a) In General</p>
<p>(4) Definitions</p>
<p>For purposes of this section:</p>
<p>(C) The term <strong>“product”</strong> means a drug, <strong>device</strong>, or biological product.</p>
<h1>Title 21 U.S. Code § 321 ((h)(1)(B))</h1>
<p>(h)</p>
<p>(1) The term <strong>“device”</strong> (except when used in paragraph (n) of this section and in sections 331(i), 343(f), 352(c), and 362(c) of this title) means an instrument, <strong>apparatus</strong>, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including any component, part, or accessory, which is—</p>
<p>(B) <strong>intended for use in</strong> the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or <strong>prevention of disease</strong>, in man or other animals, or</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>¹</strong> <strong>A face mask is a device</strong>, with or without a face shield, that covers the user’s nose and mouth and may or may not meet fluid barrier or filtration efficiency levels. It includes cloth face coverings as a subset. It may be for single or multiple uses, and if for multiple uses it may be laundered or cleaned. There are many products marketed in the United States as “face masks” that offer a range of protection against potential health hazards. Face masks are regulated by FDA when they meet the definition of a “device” under section 201(h) of the Act.</p>
<p><strong>I. Criteria for Issuance of Authorization</strong> </p>
<p>I have concluded that the <strong>emergency use of face masks</strong> in accordance with CDC recommendations as source control ... meets the criteria for issuance of an authorization under Section 564(c) of the Act, because I have concluded that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Based on the totality of “<em>scientific evidence”</em> available to FDA, it is reasonable to believe that the authorized face masks <strong>may be effective</strong> as source control to help prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by infected individuals</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Conditions of Authorization</strong></p>
<p>B. Manufacturers and Distributors of authorized products <strong>shall not label the product:</strong> 1) as a surgical mask, to provide liquid barrier protection; 2) for use in a clinical setting where the infection risk level through inhalation exposure is high; 3) for antimicrobial or antiviral protection or related uses or uses <strong>for infection prevention or reduction</strong> or related uses; 4) as a respiratory protective device; or 5) for high risk aerosol generating procedures.</p>
<p>J. No printed matter, including advertising or promotional materials, <strong>relating to the use of the authorized face mask may represent or suggest that such product is safe or effective for the prevention or treatment</strong> of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
