        <p>The reality is that I don't think you do. Yes, there are recluses - some of whom live in isolated cabins in the woods. The difference is that at least they're toiling away at something, maintaining their home, hunting, writing, ect.</p>
<p>This is none of that. People are social creatures - We focus on the example I named above because they're novel and different. It takes a great deal of mental strength to willingly remove yourself from society.</p>
<p>What we've essentially done ( And what most of us here have seen first hand ) is lock up normal people and drive them to the brink of insanity. Some aren't changed by it, others are struggling by remain quiet to stay out of the crosshairs of the "compassionate ones"... But the most vocal are the types I know a few of. The Mandalorian loving, can't wait to get my shot - pajama pants to work everyday recluse....</p>
<p>Again, this is not normal. I remember telling someone once that I found a sense of strength in  not taking anti-depressants and trying to combat my problems (to no avail). Do you know what they told me? "That makes no sense... It's like not going to a hospital for a broken leg and saying it makes you stronger". There is zero shame in saying you're struggling in these times - it exhibits signs of mental health. Those who wish for this to continue are the sick ones, NOT US.</p>
