        <p>Thats why I live by the quote “Life is CRAZY.” </p>
<p>But in all seriousness, sorry to hear that. That feeling when you are just brushed off because you are not “vaccinated” is just annoying as hell. Some people are just so blind to whats going on and unfortunately, it is what it is.</p>

        <p>When they finally “come around”, can I ask for their vaccination history do you think? I mean, if they aren’t protected against tuberculosis, they could damage my health. You know, with something actually deadly.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry, and I know it won’t help you feel better, but they kind of don’t have a choice. One of the most fascinating and dangerous aspects of the human brain is our ability to rationalize every behavior after we’ve already performed it.  Our brains will lie to us, fabricate details in memory, and tell us absolutely anything in order to maintain the sense that what we do is correct and reasonable, ESPECIALLY when it isn’t. </p>
<p>One of the common ways we seek to do this is to subconsciously dismiss or even berate others that perform behaviors opposite to our own. Combine this instinct with our evolutionary tendencies toward tribalism (in-group vs out-group social dynamics), and you get this weird (but completely natural) partisan war of justification where both sides think they hold the only reasonable position. </p>
<p>If your family allowed you to think for yourself and accepted your choices, not only would they need to understand and set aside their self protection mechanisms, they would be forced to confront their own choices and the possibility that not all of their behavior has been justified. That’s a tall order for the average person who more than likely “trusts” their own mind. They likely NEEDED there to be high risk of infection in order to rationalize getting their covid vaccination in the first place, so the idea that you made a different choice and are going to be just fine and aren’t a danger to them doesn’t fit into their reality. People lose friends and family all the time because of different permutations of this same thing.</p>
<p>The best we can do is forgive them, they don’t know they’re harming you. I’m not confident we can convince them without their sense of self coming apart.</p>

        <p>Thank you for this insight, much appreciated. I can be hard to understand how other folks mind works. Even here in England where the brainwashing is now MASSIVE.</p>
