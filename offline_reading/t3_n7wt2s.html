        <p>I'll never understand what the left has become. They used to be completely against any form of government over reach, real classic liberalism is dead and those that identify with it have no idea how far off from it they really are. They have turned into the real fascists.</p>
<p>If fascism ever comes to America, it will come in the name of liberalism. -Ronald Reagen</p>

        <p>I was reading about that recently. They captured a photo of a young girl screaming while she kneeled by a dead body. The covidiots of that error completely vilified her and ruined her life simply because she was there. They blamed the students for their own deaths and wished more were killed. Many of them were just walking to class and not involved in the protest. It reminded me a lot of what is going on now.</p>

        <p>So what? What did these people become? They still bought cars, went and got degrees, and were fully integrated into the system. They chose convenience over going their own way. </p>
<p>I’m mad at myself too. For years I saw the signs but I was too preoccupied with dumb shit and put forth no effort to wean myself off the system/not support it. </p>
<p>It’s tough and hard. But these same kids became lawyers, doctors, politicians who today care more about money and their precious licenses than truth and life.</p>
