    <strong>If you were to scared to see your partner in person especially if you were waiting for the vaccine during the pandemic you're awful</strong>
    <p><p>Covid19 has effected a lot of people mentally. During the "pandemic" a lot of people needed mental support more than ever before. Nothing makes me angrier than seeing people who neglected to visit their partner because they were to scared to catch Covid from them. Perhaps within the first couple of months is a different story because of the fact the "pandemic" was brand new. I'll let it slide if you are dating someone long distance or couldn't visit them because of travel restrictions. Basically something else that was out of your control that wasn't allowing you to visit your partner. Or they were too scared to give Covid to them. Listen it's if you actually were showing symptoms and needs to stay home so you can rest and feel better that's one thing. You should be staying home and resting if you know you're actually sick. If you waited several months or even a year just to go up to your partner and give them a hug or a kiss that's just sad. In a traditional marriage vow it literally says "for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in <strong>sickness</strong> and in <strong>health</strong>". To me I believe if your partner is suffering mentally or needs IN PERSON support you be there for them.</p></p>

        <p>I think if you don't go see your boyfriend or girlfriend for a year this is hopeless. I wouldn't stay in such a relationship. Why bother at that point, they aren't there for you. {i'm married so we were together but if I was with a man that didn't show up due to Covid forget it}</p>
