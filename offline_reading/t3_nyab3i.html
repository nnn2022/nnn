    <strong>Anyone found that friends and people you know who have had the Vaccine have changed attitudes?</strong>
    <p><p>Let me just preface, this is a complete conspiracy on my part thinking it's part of the vaccine so take it with a pinch of salt and I might just be going mad.</p>
<p>Is it just me or have people who have had the vaccine seriously changed their attitudes, I've had friends who have been amazing and friendly and great and yet since they have had the vaccine, I've had the same friends become mean, assholes, more violent and just plain unpleasant to be around.</p>
<p>Maybe it's just me, I don't know and no, these people don't know if I am vaccinated or not.</p></p>

        <p>I've experienced the same thing. I've noticed first things first, people who get the vaccine can never shut up about it. They have to tell everyone they got it, they have to ask their friends if they got it and preach it like its the gospel. It's very odd, I have had two friends who haven't been the same since getting it. They treat me differently and to put it plainly, something is off.</p>

        <p>I think it’s a psychological thing in those people. They got the shot to stop feeling afraid of covid, and realized it didn’t make them feel better. So now they’re angry. My two best friends have gotten it and are exactly the same, since they only got it because their families did.</p>

        <p>I know somebody who keeps coming at me trying to change my mind since he got it. He does this weird thing where he admits I'm not in any danger of the virus, yet wants to convince me that it's "tested and safe." I can tell he wants me to get it even though I've told him multiple times I'm not changing my mind. I've even told him that I'm 99% certain I've had it. I don't have proof, the tests didn't even exist in 12/2019 when I had it. His response is "well then you don't know you had it." Let's see, lost taste and smell, persistent dry cough, diarrhea, oh and it's the <em>only fucking thing in the world going around, what else could it be?</em></p>

        <p>Pretty sure I had it in January 2021 because my parents had it and I made zero effort to distance from them. Had a headache and was really tired for around a week. My rapid test was negative but I never got the normal test. Just took an antibody test recently and it was negative, but I just think those things aren’t reliable. The nurse doing it told me it’s not comprehensive.</p>

        <p>I have not had this experience, but there’s a divide being pushed on the media, social media etc. that is pushing vaccinated against unvaccinated, and they’re throwing politics in the mix, and in my opinion the vaccinated are more prone to being influenced by it, being they they’re weak minded enough to not question the experimental gene therapy shots being pushed on humanity. So yeah, I can see them becoming distant/hostile/mean towards unvaccinated friends and acquaintances. Stay strong minded and use the brain that God gave you to continue to think for yourself and come to your own conclusions, instead of being influenced by the garbage they feed us on TV. You don’t need weak minded people around you on these awful times anyway.</p>

        <p>One of my relatives who got the moderna vaccine called me in a screaming rage, threatening me that "you better watch what you say". She was very, very upset and enraged that I dared to speak against the holy vaccine. </p>
<p>She's usually very understated and calm so it was bizarre to hear her so out-of-control like that.</p>

        <p>Nah. That's just placebo and confirmation bias.</p>
<p>I have one dose of vaccine (long story of internal calculating risk/reward plus the fact I don't want kids so potential long term genetic effects aren't really a big deal) but I still hold basically identical personality traits as well as the same stances on the vaccine itself: do your own research, weigh your own risks, and don't get it just because someone from the news told you they're very concerned over variant 93728171</p>

        <p>I don't think it has to do with the shot itself but PTSD from what they have allowed them self to be subject to for over a year. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>My sister and I both served in the military had very different experiences but have been diagnosed with PTSD. Some might say I am stoic but I think it more of a dulling of my emotional response. My sister on the other hand has anger management that she is working through. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Some will handle it better than others. Have sympathy for those who have yet to seek help. Believe it or not, but many people do not want to feel like they have mental issues. They may see mental issues as being a victim and they do not want to be a victim. So they lash out at others if they feel like someone is insinuating that they are. Pointing out the lies told in the last year will make them defensive, not of the lies or those who lied, but of their own personal being.</p>

We used to have soulful conversations.  I just don’t trust her the same anymore .  I’m completely serious about this .  I’ve cried over this.  I miss my old mom.
