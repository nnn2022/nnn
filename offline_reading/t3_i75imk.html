        <p>Right? I'm not worried about getting vaccinated, I'm worried about being LEGALLY FORCED to get it before it's been tested on the human population for <em>at least</em> a month or two. I don't want to be a lab rat.</p>

        <p>That's why I said "at least" they'll take even more of your rights away if you don't get it. I'd like to make sure that there aren't any immediate issues with the vaccine - ideally, of course I'd wait a decade or more to make sure there aren't any (significant) long-term effects, but I'm not going to stay locked down for that long because I won't take an untested vaccine lol.</p>
<p>We will have three choices - take the untested vaccine, stay locked down forever or overthrow the government. Neither option is appealing, and the "overthrow the government" one isn't really realistic considering the ridiculous gun laws around here. If I was able to skip the vaccine without repercussions I absolutely would, but I'm trying to be realistic here. I'm not gonna take it until studies show that it's safe in the short-medium term at the ABSOLUTE minimum.</p>

        <p>Okay you can stay locked down forever if you want lol. I thought the whole idea of this sub was to get out of the whole lockdown/mask ordeal as soon as possible. That's what I'm gonna do, within reason. I don't want a sketchy vaccine either but if that's my only reasonable choice I'm going from it. I don't have an army on standby to fight government tyranny unfortunately.</p>
<p>Just letting you know masktards and doomers are likely going to enact laws (once this vaccine comes out) akin to those enacted in Victoria. No leaving the house for more than one hour, fines of up to 10 grand for not wearing a mask, police searches without a warrant etc...</p>
<p>People seem to think the constitution matters. It doesn't anymore. People break the constitution's rules all the time; they're doing it right now.</p>

        <p>If the vaccine works why do the vaccinated worry about those who aren’t.  This doesn’t make sense.  </p>
<p>I’m guessing it’s because the vaccine doesn’t work very good so the more people vaccinated the better the chance it works?</p>

        <p>Their position is that by having <em>everyone else</em> be vaccinated, this protects those who <em>cannot</em> be vaccinated. It's the same line of thinking as with the masks ("it's to protect <em>others</em> from <em>you</em>").</p>
<p>The legal basis for mandating them is shoddy at best, quoting an old court case that set a precedent for it - but the problem is, even in that example, the person just paid a small fine, they weren't forced to take the inoculation. Not to mention all the other problems with trying to jerryrig that into the current situation which is a respiratory illness that is no danger to the overwhelming majority of the population.</p>
<p>We're in for a rough time if the world applies the same tone-deaf narrow-minded blanket approach ignoring all consequences with this as it has since day 1 of this whole shit show.</p>

        <p>They will say that the vaccine only grants immunity for a time. Therefore, everyone must be vaccinated, and within a short time frame, to eradicate the virus. If the virus is allowed to replicate in any tiny group of people, it could eventually spread back to the entire population. I think that’s how they might justify it.</p>

        <p>I think it's to do with the fact that some people can't get the vaccine on medical ground so if more people who can have it, do have it, it would protect those people. Fuck I'm beginning to sound like an MSM lapper-upper. I'm with everyone on the anti-CV stuff but with vaccines as a concept I agree.</p>

        <p>I agree with them as a concept too. As a concept vaccines are supposed to be tested for years and be among the safest medical interventions available, which won't be the case with this one.</p>

        <p>Who doesn’t agree with the concept of vaccines? That’s not what the debate is about. The vaccines we are given are always loaded with super toxic ingredients and the manufacturers have immunity from being sued. They aren’t tested and they aren’t safe.</p>

        <p>Well you've just contradicted yourself there, haven't you? You either agree with vaccines or you don't. All of these "toxic" things your lot are complaining about are a necessary component in order for them to be feasible. They are tested in a multi stage process, beginning with animals and ending with human volunteers. 1-0?</p>

        <p>I hope you're right about the children. I support vaccination in theory - voluntary vaccination - but it makes me sick to my stomach when little kids are so proud of being vaccinated like it makes them so damn tough. At the behest of their parents, of course: "Little Timmy, tell the nice lady how you're so big and strong because you got your shots like a grown-up!"</p>
<p>And as for religious people, most I know are all very pro-vaccine because Daddy Government and Mommy Megacorporation say so. Total opposite of the stereotypical religious anti-vaxxer.</p>

        <p>I think this is how it will go down. </p>
<p>It won't be "mandatory", but it will be <em>mandatory</em>. You'd need to show proof of vaccinations at places like Walmart, Target, Dollar Tree, Home Depot, whatever. I have a feeling many small businesses, the ones that manage to somehow survive anyway, will also implement this as well. Want to go to a doctor or dentist? Need to show your vaccine ID. Want to keep working at your current job? Need that vaccine, baby. Wanna go on vacation? Vaccine. Possibly to cross state borders? Maybe vaccine, too. It's like with masks, it will slowly become more and more mandatory, and some states will be more forceful about them than others, but I have a feeling it will roll out nationally eventually.</p>
<p>Edit: This started off with downvotes, and I just don't understand why people are in denial of this being a possibility. Seems like a lot of people here believe the vaccine will just come to existance, and that will be that. Normal will come back. Just like normal returned two weeks after that cute little lockdown that happened. Oh, wait.</p>

        <p>It's not going to go over well. It would take a long time for either "side" to win, and there will be mass casualties, and more fall-out from a war. I also have a feeling our side will still be outnumbered and outgunned, at least for some time. People are practically brainwashed and ignorant, and are choosing fear over their rights.</p>

        <p>Yes, exactly. I got downvoted when I initially wrote this comment, and looks like you were as well. It really frustrates me that the people in this sub can't see that, and seem to believe we can outmatch the majority (government as well), and win the war. No, this isn't a movie or a show, where the scrappy underdogs win just because they're the protagonists...</p>

        <p>Why though? For me, what gives me solace is knowing this is all cyclical. Civilizations rise and fall, always have, always will. Tyranny gives way to liberty, liberty gives way to tyranny, like the tides, like sunrise and sunset. What matters is what side of history you stand on, the side of liberty or the side of tyranny. I know where I stand, however rocky or mucky the ground may be at times, and I have an idea of where you stand too. If there will be mass casualties anyway, what matters is what they stood for and what they fell for.</p>

        <p>They might have a harder time looking for people who already barely exist. It's easier to go off-grid when you avoid the grid to begin with. My husband and I figured it would come to this ever since we were children, so we've been lying low and preparing for some time now. Of course we still have a trail to track us by - social media, husband's tax history, vehicle registration, our childhood medical records courtesy of our parents - but we'll be harder to track than middle-class urbanites or suburbanites with bank accounts and credit cards and more recent medical records. Of course it'll still be a struggle, and we can't stay hidden forever. But I don't think this is the best time or place to discuss the full extent of our plans.</p>

        <p>This is basically what my husband and I plan on doing, though maybe not packing so light or staying so hidden. We can't hide forever, only bide our time and build ourselves up, so might as well pack heavy. This was already our plan since long before COVID, the current situation only spurs a sense of urgency. The main hurdles we face are buying that land and building that community. We currently lack the money to buy land, would prefer the purchase to involve minimal exchange of personally identifying information, and don't even know where to begin with building a community. We have family and friends, but most aren't exactly able-bodied or able-minded. Can't do it all on our own though.</p>

        <p>I'd like to think requiring proof of vaccination just to buy some fucking popsicles and acrylic paints would be too much of a hassle for most businesses. Then again, if they push for digital currency and electronic payment, medical history could easily be scanned by the checkout machine. And self-checkout at Walmart is already refusing cash, so....</p>
<p>Hopefully we're wrong, because my husband and I are NOT getting that vaccine. Hopefully we can makes enough money, buy some land, stockpile whatever resources, and more-or-less drop off the map before it's too late. Either way, we're in for a struggle. I really think people should reevaluate their priorities and prepare to go underground if necessary, at least long enough to gather themselves for whatever comes next. Not like literally underground though. Well, you can if you want. But I'd prefer a cabin up on a hill.</p>

        <p>It won't be a hassle because it will have been implemented from the top down, it's all about centralization of power and control.</p>
<p>When major currencies are finally transitioned to crypto it'll be a trivial increment to tie in the digital identification with the whole health passport / immunity passport thing. At that point you just need to tap or scan 1 thing that can be applied to all institutions and corporations. Then they just mandate that you need to operate with that system in order to stay in business. Done.</p>

        <p>correct, they wouldn't use actual crypto as we know them like bitcoin, ethereum, monero etc</p>
<p>it will definitely be a proprietary centralized system they have total control over, they'll just use the crypto/blockchain terminology to sell it to people as something it's not</p>

        <p>Yet another "hopefully" statement: Hopefully they'll start with people who already have more personally identifying information to their name, as that information would provide a headstart in building a more complete digital identity. Similar to how people with direct deposit and more of a financial history (and often more money) received their stimulus check first. In that case, while people like my husband and I would probably be booted out of the economy sooner because we're more-or-less nobodies, we might also maintain what little privacy we have for a little bit longer. Aaannd hopefully, this bullshit spurs alternate economic systems outside of the corporate/government technocracy.</p>

<p>“Let me put it very clearly: you have no constitutional right to endanger the public and spread the disease, even if you disagree. You have no right not to be vaccinated. … And if you refuse to be vaccinated, the state has the power to literally take you to a doctor’s office and plunge a needle into your arm.”</p>

        <p>This is completely unacceptable. You have the right to refuse medical treatment of any kind, why is this vaccine different all of a sudden? If people can refuse surgery for deadly cancers and leave the hospital AMA, I don't understand why you can't refuse a simple vaccine. I mean, you shouldn't leave the hospital AMA, but they can't keep you there against your will in most cases. And of course, people are gonna call you selfish for speaking out against it. This has gone too far. How this is not considered unconstitutional is beyond me.</p>

        <p>&rt; You have the right to refuse medical treatment of any kind, why is this vaccine different all of a sudden?</p>
<p>This is the question people should be asking themselves. This vaccine has been mentioned since March by many "experts" including Fauci, the FDA, Bill Gates, etc. Think about this, they have touted this vaccine as being necessary as opposed to other treatments and medications since around the time the lockdowns began. Almost as if they <em>knew</em> something. I always found that very suspect, that they'd be so reliant on the vaccine even back when this virus was allegedly brand new. They even gave a time frame of when it'd be available, 12-18 months. How interesting, isn't it? How would they know that? Especially given that vaccines take many years to develop?</p>
<p>I was recently insulted by some of the regulars on here (you know who you are) because I apparently "shit on optimism regarding the vaccine". To many people, the vaccine is being seen as the answer, as the "ticket back to normal", so this is the attitude being fostered around here by some of the supporters for it.</p>
<p>Of course, I have a feeling they won't be allowing normalcy to return even after the vaccines are deployed, mandatory or not. I think they will keep a lot of the security theater, for whatever reason they may have for doing so. Note how they have, once again, pushed goal posts with the vaccine. It's not just about having it come into existance, they also need "the overwhelming majority of the population" to get it as well, or normal won't return.</p>

        <p>Oh, there will be a vaccine. It will be a placebo at first, but that won't matter - the asymptomatic rate of the virus is greater than the average effectiveness of the flu shot. They will keep the security theater too, not because of the ineffectiveness of the vaccine, but because of 'evil anti-vaccers'.</p>

        <p>You lose your rights the moment they deem you a "danger" to yourself and others. Unfortunately, they play this card more than you seem to realize. DNR orders are regularly ignored, people (especially children) are regularly forced or coerced into cancer treatment, nevermind what drugs they administer and what procedures they perform when you aren't conscious. Hospitals can indeed keep you against your will, and they often do. All they have to do is deem you mentally unfit to decide.for yourself what happens to your own body. And if you don't want their so-called preventative care or "life-saving" treatment, you must be mentally unfit.</p>

        <p>It's because they have managed to convince large swathes of the population that the rona is a global black death / bubonic plague / airborne aids of <em>world-ending proportions</em>. They've convinced these people that this invisible enemy is <em>everywhere</em>, that they might transmit this horrible deadly disease to anyone unknowingly, <em>unless</em> they do exactly as told to "fight the virus".</p>
<p>The actual facts of the matter hold virtually no weight as they would not support any of this insane response. A poll showed people think \~30 million have already perished from it in the US. </p>
<p>That is what people are reacting to, not the actual statistics showing it not to be any significant danger to the overwhelming majority of the population. That's why imposing the vaccine for the greater good actually sounds reasonable to these people. Fear shuts down rational thought, hence it is wielded, or more like weaponized really, via institutional propaganda outlets.</p>

        <p>And the second you say "This is kinda messed up" you would get swarmed by people calling you a COVID denier and anti-vax. Question though, why does it matter if someone refuses a vaccine? Isn't the point of a vaccine to nullify the threat?</p>

        <p>You know what, I'm inching towards 'yes'. </p>
<p>Why am I being called selfish while being required to continually make sacrifices for the continued existence of the weak?  Why is a minority of people demanding something of a majority, and getting it by government force not the 'selfish' group?</p>
<p>I've never received a thank you for funding welfare via my taxes from one of the beneficiaries of those programs, either. But they do rush to call me evil and selfish when I vote for defundings of such things.</p>

        <p>I'm not anti vaccine by any means. But there's no denying that this vaccine is rushed and hasn't gone through the proper procedures in order to be classified as safe. There's nothing suggesting that there won't be drastic side effects to this vaccine, and yet it's going to be forced upon us. Pretty soon, all the "Wear A Mask" memes will turn into "Get the Vaccine".</p>

        <p>For a few years before the pandemic there has been a lot of pro-vax propaganda leading to hatred of anti-vaxxers. One big point I often see is that it to protect those who can’t be vaccinated and to maintain herd immunity. While the concept is true, I feel that the government should not have the power to make you take a certain treatment or procedure.</p>

        <p>If you don't even have the right under the law to bodily autonomy, to not be forcibly violated by others (which, even in the form of a syringe, does in fact meet the definition of forcible rape!), what rights do you have? None, if the state can forcibly rape you if those in power want to badly enough. That's a long-winded way of saying you have no rights at all, which in turn is a long-winded way of saying people like this attorney don't believe laws have any meaning.</p>

        <p>This is shocking but not surprising to me given that way back in March when the first lock down started my immediate concern about everything was that it was all going to lead to forced vaccinations. And my concern has only grown since then that that’s what this is all about. People have got to fight back on this. No matter if you’re personally for or against vaccines, <em>everyone</em> should be against the government making it mandatory.</p>

<p>those with an interest in seeing the whole world be vaccinated, catalogued. tracked and controlled like cattle extend far beyond "the government". the government not making it mandatory just isn't good enough, as it's going to end up being effectively mandatory regardless of any such law by way of giant corporations instituting it as "company policy".</p>
<p>rather than the question solely of it being mandatory or not, the focus should really be on ensuring that no entity of any kind may coerce anyone either directly or indirectly. unfortunately that agenda is already well under way, just try traveling anywhere right now and see what happens.</p>

        <p>Well exactly. I certainly don't imagine it being something where suddenly one day the government just announces it's mandatory to get vaccinated by everyone. It'll happen in stages, like first you have the have the vaccine if you want to travel internationally. Then it'll be if you want to travel domestically. Certain companies will require it if you want to work (I work in the film industry and with the absurd and ridiculous guidelines and requirements they already have implemented for filming to resume, I could absolutely see that being one of the first industries to require a vaccination to be able to work). Until pretty soon you'll need the vaccine to be able to do anything.</p>

        <p>I think the reason they are pushing the fears for the virus so much is because they want people so afraid, they'll want to take the vaccine out of fear of dying or getting permanent damage from it. Same with lockdowns, masks, and the other "New Normal" stuff, they hold Normal hostage so then people will take the vaccine as means to placate the "kidnappers". There will be some pushback against the vaccine, but I see it playing out similarly to what is going on with masks. I am hoping this will change, especially now with more protests happening, but...we'll see how it unfolds.</p>

        <p>Question: if somehow protests fail and this mandate goes through in some states, would we be allowed to have a grace period to pack up and move to a different state that doesn't require the vaccine?</p>
<p>Because I think it's only fair that if someone lives in a state that will require it that we should have the freedom of movement and a deadline to move out of said state. They shouldn't just hammer in the mandate and immediately arrest people who don't rush out to the vaccine lines</p>

        <p>Besides this my concern is the goalposts shifting yet again - vaccine isn't enough, no new normal, learn to live with it. To so many - and we see this attitude in the media as well - this seems to be where it's going.</p>
<p>Vaccines are wonderful, but forcing them smacks of the authoritarianism of *everything* that is wrong with lockdowns.</p>

        <p>I'm not supporting that. This is just what I and many others feared could happen: Proof of vaccination (or medical exemption thereof) would become required to go into just about any public place and/or as a condition of employment. I see what a lot of people mean by mandatory masks being a precursor to mandatory vaccination. I can see how in 2021, you could replace "mask" with "shot/vaccine" for all the virtue signaling, zealotry, snitching, and even bullying/violence. I think it's possible that vaccine refusers for this one could be seen as holding "normal" hostage.</p>
<p>He claims state police power but I have a feeling some states or at least some municipalities may not enforce a vaccine mandate.</p>
<p>I think this will lead to protests, more gun sales, and even panic buying. Either way, this should be unconstitutional. Jacobson v . Massachusetts predates Nuremburg.</p>

<p>I can't say that I'm not a bit nervous about how early the vaccine might be coming out, but let's be honest- this is a shitty situation and I would like to return to the old normal as quickly as possible. If there were any sort of assurance from my local government that I would be allowed into a sporting or music venue to see a game or concert upon taking the vaccine, I think I would be among the first to try and get it. That sort of normalcy in my life is that important to me that I would be willing to take that risk.</p>
<p>Of course, if the government drags their feet on widely reopening even after a vaccine is available for the public, then it's a different story.</p>

        <p>I agree with you. I don't have any qualms against the vaccine itself (though I don't plan to be first in line for it) and the sooner we get back to normal the better IMO. </p>
<p>However, if we get the vaccine or if it mysteriously gets delayed, then it is indeed a different story. They'll be nothing left to hide behind if there really is some push for a "new normal"</p>
