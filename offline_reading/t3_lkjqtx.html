        <p>Also wanted to point out, the flu just disappears this year and it’s already likely for elderly to die in nursing homes. Remember the time the news reported a construction worker fell to his death and died on scene but tested positive upon arriving at the hospital and it was listed as a Covid-19 death? Well I hope people can see what I mean. In other words anyone that gets a positive test using the PCR tests known for false results will result in a covid death no matter how they died. ( remember hospitals get paid for this shit for some odd reason ) but anyways elderly dying in nursing homes is a common thing they die from disease, old age etc. </p>
<p>If you have a family member that tested positive for covid and has 0 symptoms or mild symptoms DONT PUT THEM ON THE VENTILATOR IT WILL KILL THEM. The ventilators literally are the reason a lot of people are suffering.</p>

        <p>Both my 82 year old grandparents had it. My grandfather literally had to be unpleasant to the nurses at the hospital so they would let him leave. And at that point he wasn't leaving they were refusing to treat him. So either they kept him there against his will or refused their treatment.</p>

        <p>I was living in Amsterdam in December 2019 and the singer of the band I was playing in had a dry cough for 2 months, doctors didn’t have a clue what was going on. </p>
<p>Everyone I knew got knocked on their arse that winter with a cold/flu thing. </p>
<p>I was going to nightclubs with some younger friends, lots of party drugs around, and I had a comedown that felt like I was dying. That scared me straight!</p>
<p>We’re all still alive though, although this doesn’t feel like living anymore! </p>
<p>I used to travel around freely in Europe, picking up a cold everytime I went on a plane. </p>
<p>Ah, the good old days!</p>

        <p>I've lost my great grandad to "covid"</p>
<p>He was 97 and fell over at his care home where he'd been for the past few years. Has been perfectly fine throughout the covid thing was tested weekly and was found not to be positive each time.</p>
<p>He tipped and broke his hip carry g his dressing gown and went into the RUH hospital in UK. My nan was told she wasn't allowed to visit her father due to him now being on a covid ward. (he didn't have covid)</p>
<p>Over the week we hear less and less that he's getting worse and then eventually we received a message from the hospital saying that he had unfortunately passed away, we knew it was not covid as he was tested weekly and came back fine.</p>
<p>My nan tried to query the death certificate as we knew it wasn't covid that caused his death at all, more to do with the fact he was 97, confused why he was In hospital, in complete agony after breaking his hip and having an operation on it which just added to his confusion.</p>
<p>But the death cert said covid. My nan asked regarding the legitimate cause of death to which they explained what it was only for them to tell her that covid had to be put on the cert and if we were to go against it they would delay the funeral by up to two months...</p>

        <p>That’s such a sad story, and unfortunately, I believe it’s not a one-off, or “bad luck”</p>
<p>Old age and death is a thing, no matter what Peter Pan nonsense we’re fed from Hollywood that we will reverse ageing process through creams and Botox.</p>
<p>My 95 year old Nan died last year, she was the hub of our family. An expected funeral crowd of 100 people was whittled down to 5 (I didn’t make the cut) I’m not sure if they put her death down as Covid, but she definitely just died of old age and multiple falls etc.</p>
<p>I think stories like yours are exactly why they don’t want us (the people/the great unwashed) all meeting up, and sharing these emotional experiences.</p>
<p>The feeling I had from reading this was more real  and relatable than any covid related stories I’ve seen or read in the media.</p>
<p>Regards to your family for having to deal with this nonsense on top of an already sad time for you all.</p>

        <p>Thank you for the reply, we're getting there slowly but surely just sucks we can't get together at all properly just makes grieving so much harder.</p>
<p>I think you're right though, as they know there a lot of funny business going about and to have all the people that can see it together wouldn't be a good thing for them at all if we were all to speak up I'm certain it wouldn't be welcomed at All.</p>
<p>I'm also sorry to hear about your nan, having to reduce the numbers is unfair and feels wrong to me that you aren't even allowed to see your nan off as a family. Honestly I really feel for you :(</p>
<p>I understand about age being a factor in alot of people that have passed but it just feels so wrong that they're doing it the ways they are and overriding legitimate causes just to add the numbers is inhumane to me, kind of feels like disrespect but maybe I'm just waffling a bit</p>
<p>I hope you've been well since and have been coping okay overall though!</p>

<p>These were people in their 60s/70/80/90/100 with underlying conditions...some on hospice.</p>

        <p>Yeah, my Grandma knows three people that have died in her extended family, all had preexisting conditions that got worse with covid, they were already heavily medicating </p>
<p>On the other hand I live with my grandma and she's a two-time cancer survivor, who ALSO won't ever stop telling me about how bad her immune system is because of all the antibiotics she took according to her</p>
<p>she lives in fear, now refuses to go to any store unless she's gonna starve, does monthly trips like there is a contagion </p>
<p>I have a exposure  job delivering food going into businesses constantly and she consistently tests negative</p>
<p>Besides that, my cousin has had covid 3 times apparently, they're in Arizona and I don't talk to them much, but nobody has died or has organ damage. at all</p>
<p>Dunno man</p>
<p>I thought this was biological warfare from China or the US, anyone,.I took it really seriously for months and months, I have a strap on mask with replaceable thick carbon filters</p>
<p>The thing is I'm in Florida I mean in a red County and I like I said deliver food </p>
<p>and I just keep going to work</p>
<p>time keeps passing</p>
<p>every single night the restaurants are absolutely packed with people </p>
<p>smiling </p>
<p>Laughing </p>
<p>having a good time</p>
<p>not social distancing</p>
<p>everybody just eating in the restaurant</p>
<p>because the restaurants here are not requiring masks for indoor dining, because we value freedom I guess</p>
<p><em>people aren't dropping in the streets</em>
This has led me to question the deadliness of the virus</p>
<p>I don't think it's fake</p>
<p>I do think it's real</p>
<p>I think it's being overreported</p>
<p>I think it's not as deadly as is being portrayed</p>
<p>I know  that sounds like an uneducated argument founded in hearsay and pure speculation, but I'm just basing it off of my personal experience of living here</p>
<p>seeing normal, sane people,like landowning people with 401ks, schoolteachers </p>
<p>everybody </p>
<p>literally everybody is just living their life here</p>
<p><em>it's not just like rednecks anymore</em> </p>
<p>and if you let the media  tell you that you're a sheep</p>
<p>The governor just had a press conference yesterday, we are 27th for mortality rate in the country</p>
<p>These businesses are thriving </p>
<p>literally, I look at the rest of the United States and it doesn't seem like Florida</p>
<p>It is such a weird dystopian reality</p>
<p>everybody is still locked down with no communication to the outside world and everybody delivers everything</p>
<p>I literally am a delivery driver and like people just do it because it's nice</p>
