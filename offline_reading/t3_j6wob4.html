    <strong>If the virus was as dangerous as they say, then politicians, "experts" and journalists would have lost their careers to this some even put to trial and arrested, but that hasn't happened because there is simply no case for that</strong>
    <p><p><strong>Lebanon Bomb, Government steps down and these responsible punished</strong><br>
<strong>East European Nightclub Fire, Government steps down, responsible punished</strong><br>
<strong>Ukrainian Government shoots protestors, Government steps down punished.</strong><br>
<strong>And dozens of other cases of people put at risk because of dangerous neglegement.</strong> </p>
<p>Yet why isn't China punished for keeping secret and lies about this? Why isn't WHO punished? Why isn't the "experts" who said the virus is just a flu punished? Why hasn't politicians stepped down or been charged with neglect? What about all the news sites that said this virus wasn't serious back in January and February?</p>
<p>Want to know why? Because there is no case. These experts didn't lie. Governments, Media made a flip around the issue then slowly silenced experts saying otherwise.</p>
<p>But there is no case, try putting these people at trial at the Hague. You can't' because as I said that would actually require evidence that this virus is so much more dangerous than influenza etc.</p></p>

        <p>The only reason you can currently be wrong on the internet for me to unfortunately witness is science. Statistically speaking its a big reason your mom was able to give birth to you without dying. Its the reason you aren't a sustenance farmer. It's a large part of the reason you will most likely live past 40 years old. Its the reason you currently don't have the bubonic plague and the reason you are not a citizen of Nazi Germany. Science doesn't need permission of a lowly ape to prove its efficacy.</p>

        <p>Firstly it can, secondly that is irrelevant. Science not having every single answer right now does not invalidate all of the answers it does have. This is ridiculously fallacious argumentation. Not that you care about being logically congruent with reality.</p>

        <p>Science is different from religion in that it is BEGGING to be proven wrong, you clearly think you are smart and evidently you believe you have evidence that covid is not as the scientists present so then publish your information. Have it be peer reviewed and verified under proper testing conditions. You would become famous and very rich for this info. So I ask why don't you? Is it your cowardice? Or do deep down even you realize you have no idea what you are talking about.</p>
