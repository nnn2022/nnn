    <strong>The brainwashing is too deep for things to go back to normal after a vaccine.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm going to give you three examples I've seen that show me how unlikely it is for things to back to the way they were. This post will be pretty long.</p>
<ol>
<li>One of my best friends, who was initially anti-lockdown has been ignoring me every time I talk about hanging out. Last week, he finally told me that he really does want to hang out, but he and his girlfriend are worried about getting sick. They're concerned about it because her employer will make her work from home while sick and will only pay her half her salary, and she wouldnt be able to afford that. He thinks that it's somewhat risky to hang out with me because I don't follow the mandates. I only see my girlfriend (who I live with), and go out to eat in another state with my parents about once a week. Since he still wants to hang out, he's decided he'll wear a mask the entire time he's at my apartment.</li>
</ol>
<p>So first and foremost, one of my closest friends sees me as a possible disease vector before he sees me as a friend. On top of that, he's so used to accepting abuse from authority that he's more concerned about my flouting of rules than he is about his girlfriend's employer's likely illegal threat.</p>
<ol>
<li>Target attempted to deny my dad his prescribed medication because he wasn't wearing a mask. Eventually a manager said they'd give it to him "just this once". This medication is a necessity for him. Fortunately, he normally just has it shipped to his house and this was a mistake.</li>
</ol>
<p>I couldn't find a single person other than my mom, sister, or girlfriend that thought it was disturbing that they wanted to deny his medication. Most people either didn't respond when I told them or said he needed to wear a mask. One person said he was putting everyone's health at risk. This same person also cheered for the BLM riots. So in their eyes, a 60 year old man picking up medicine is putting everyone's very lives in danger. This is essentially saying that if my dad won't follow the rules, he can just rot.</p>
<ol>
<li>A friend of mine is an essential worker. One of her coworkers had a room mate that got sick and was waiting on her COVID test. The employer asked her to stay home until the room mates results were in. Fair enough. It turns out that she DID have covid. Yesterday, my friend's coworker started showing symptoms, but again, he's still staying home. The coworker was never sick at work and didn't get sick until over 5 days after going home. Another one of my friend's coworkers said "It's a good thing we were wearing masks, otherwise we'd be in the same boat".</li>
</ol>
<p>The basic thought process of "This person wasn't sick, which is why they didn't make me sick" has been interrupted to shoehorn in masks. Now the logic goes "This person wasn't sick, but they WOULD HAVE made me sick, had I not been wearing this old t-shirt over my face". </p>
<p>So, because people see their friends as disease vector, because people are so willing to accept abuse of authority, and because people will reroute basic logic to include the illogical, I don't things will go back to normal.</p></p>

        <p>I have to agree. A lot of people's brains broke in March 2020 and now they're way too deep in hypochondria. It's going to take a ton of therapy to get them out of it. Even after they take the vaccine, they will still be scared of crowds and groups for a long time. Because they can't let go of the "what ifs"... what if someone who isn't vaccinated spreads it to me and I kill someone's grandma etc... They've been worrying like this for almost a year straight and it's not going to stop overnight. </p>
<p>I was getting depressed thinking  about this last night. Most of my friends will not hang out with me in person because of covid now. And like, were these people ever really my friends? If I ask them to hang out (even "safely") and they say "no we're in a pandemic blah blah". If the day comes when they actually <em>want</em> to hang out, will I even want to see them? I've lost so much respect for them, they've been acting like cowards. They don't see the value in human interaction, apparently they're perfectly content to lock themselves in their houses and do everything virtually for over a year.</p>

        <p>Please don't hold anger towards your friends, I only say that because as much as I don't want to be, I'm terrified of catching/spreading this virus and I've denied hanging out with friends as well, and it's not because I don't care about them or miss them, or because I see them as a "disease vector", the fear in my brain is just winning this race lately. I'm a "scared skeptic". All the media just pumped fear into my brain but at the same time I'm skeptical because officials are going on vacations, more people are getting sick despite the vaccine. Theres just a lot of information and you don't want to do the wrong thing. It's a scary time for everyone, whether it's about the virus or the corruption.</p>

        <p>I completely agree with you. I don't see how we ever go back to normal. I don't see how these brainwashed people will ever go back to seeing people as normal people rather than a walking virus... many people I know have already expressed how they will no longer do a lot of things - shake someone's hand, go to public places like bowling or movie theaters, etc... </p>
<p>People will never view other human beings as they once used to. What really sucks is being the only one who is still normal.</p>

        <p>I know of a handful of people, like previous coworker, acquiantances from years ago, etc, who want life to go back to normal and I might reach out to them. It seems better to build friendships with people who dont see constitutional rights as disposable, view me as a person, and value life over a false sense of security.</p>

        <p>I have a feeling that the corona cult is going to smoothly shift into being the Biden cult. All the behavior and bullying and hatred is going to be the same, just redirected to the next adjacent political religion. People are just in it too deep to ever return to normal.</p>

<p>Why didn't he just wear a mask? Like I get that he might not want to if he feels it doesn't help but...it clearly shouldn't surprise anyone at this point that stores require them. They also will kick you out if you aren't wearing pants, which is basically their right as a private business. I don't understand how this is Target's fault?</p>

        <p>He's been in the target other times without a mask. And I've been without one as well. The pharmacists working there specifically tried to deny him his medication. That isn't that Target's policy. </p>
<p>The "they're a private business" argument is weird too though because businesses are being forced to do it. For example, restaurants make you wear one in the lobby when they seat you. They know that does nothing, but they don't want to get in trouble and they don't want Karen yelp reviews about how "this place doesn't care if people die". If a business didn't feel forced, they likely wouldn't force you to do it. </p>
<p>And for the pants argument, most people dont want to wear masks but you would feel naked and weird without pants on. Our society has worn pants for a long time and nobody has really ever been like "yeah idk about this pants thing". You've probably never argued with an anti-pantser on reddit. Masks are uncomfortable, most people take them off as soon as they can, they complain about the face acne it gives them, they readjust them constantly, they say "I can't wait until I don't have to wear this thing anymore". Again if they didn't have to wear them to go into buildings and they weren't scared that someone would get in their face about it, they wouldn't wear them. </p>
<p>The main point of my post though is that I would consider, "they should have just offered to ship it same day" or "I wouldve just given it to him but he should probably wear a mask" to be normal responses. Most people I told the story to replied with "your dad should have worn a mask, he's putting lives at risk" or just no response. These people talk about how we're going back to normal really soon and they can't wait but then the same people think of my dad is this horrible villain cause he picked up medicine without a mask. I could have a bias in my responses though because most of the people I told the story to wear them religiously.</p>

        <p>Yeah idk seems like a very easy problem to solve if you just put one on for 5 minutes (even if you think it's useless). And it has been target policy since July even if your local store hasn't been following it. </p>

<p>Not wearing a mask and then complaining when you get asked to leave just seems like shitting your pants and then complaining about the smell.</p>
