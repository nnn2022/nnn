        <p>The worst part of all, the most sick part of everything, is that they probably record those suicides as "covid19 deaths"....</p>
<p>I can tell you that I know, indirectly, four people who were registered as "covid deaths". <strong>Three of them died of cardiac failure and the remaining one died of advanced cancer.</strong> Neither of the four showed any type of respiratory problems and they died <strong>at home.</strong> They were "asymptomatic carriers" and they died from totally unrelated causes to covid19. <strong>However, they were registered and counted as "covid deaths", because when they did the post mortem test, it returned positive.</strong> I also know a lot of other people that experienced very similar cases.</p>
<p>Plus, everyone knows that hospitals get paid $40.000 every time they report a covid19 case, which obviously creates a conflict of interest. The numbers are clearly inflated in all this, and they use this awful tactics to keep putting the numbers up, so they can justify all of what they are doing. Tragic.</p>

        <p>If this is true(and I have some doubts, mind you), then the problem is really serious.</p>
<p>The issue with this is unless some official source shows they have deliberately marked unrelated deaths as covid deaths, it's continually going to remain in the fringe.</p>
<p>Mind you, its not as fringe as "5G causes covid" or "Covid doesn't exist and is a hoax".</p>
<p>It has to be based on facts, and more importantly, evidence. Think of presenting yourself in the court of law.</p>
<p>The more disturbing fact is they can use any lockdown related deaths and even suicides to prop up numbers. Hey, what's another thousand dead in service of the agenda right? Whatever that is.</p>

<p>WAIT, are you really telling me that you are not aware of this. The authorities have made it quite clear, in press conferences, all over the world. This has been a very controversial point brought up by many doctors and scientists around the world because it blocks the possibility of having real and solid numbers regarding the virus' true action range. </p>

        <p>Oh that. I'm very aware of this.</p>
<p>What they say could easily mean that covid symptoms finally pushed the patient over the edge. Any logical person would conclude that. Of course they could be specific and say complications from both killed the person to be accurate.</p>
<p>Minor symptom/no symptom covid artificially being classified as a covid death is a huge difference from the above.</p>
<p>You are trying to convince people that are skeptical yes? Then the fact needs to be clear and concise. If its not you are just preaching to the choir(us). Numbers like that mortality has dropped precipitously are clear and easy to explain.</p>

        <p>Ok, I admit I skimmed through it.</p>
<p>Very good. Can we have more of them? Because pockets of insanity exist, like in New Zealand and parts of Australia. Or schools with literal plastic bubbles around children. But it doesn't mean all are like that. Same with extreme doomers wearing hazmat suits and carrying disinfectant sprays. Doesn't mean all doomers are like that either.</p>
<p>I did a search and she's responsible for Illinois? What about other states? What about in higher positions? What about other countries?</p>
<p>We had to look through how much data to be at the position we are in now? To convince a doomer we'll have to do that plus however deep in the pit they are in.</p>

        <p>Thanks, and I'm going to say we don't have energy/time to spend on every article and news just to hopefully, maybe, convince another brainwashed person.</p>
<p>Searching in 2020 isn't just opening up google and typing what you want. You have to first know what you want to search, then wade to all the garbage and noise, then filter out things that sound legitimate but are propaganda, then maybe, you'll find one site.</p>
<p>I live in Canada, and it sounds like you live in the States, and you'll have better firsthand information of the things in your country.</p>
<p>This is why we help each other.</p>

        <p>Estimates I've seen have said that in the US alone we will likely see 75,000-100,000 "deaths of despair" aka suicides because peoples lives are destroyed and they just give up. </p>
<p>But hey it was just a shotgun in the mouth so it doesn't go on the COVID stats so it's not a death that matters.</p>

        <p>This was pretty relevant to me yesterday coming home from work. There was a jumper on the Narrows Bridge being talked down by a police officer. I don't know if he jumped. We were all going 60+ mph. But just that quick image of a kid on the edge really stuck with me. Made me think of all the trickle-down effects this pandemic has had on people.</p>
