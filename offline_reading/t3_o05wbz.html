    <strong>Propaganda reaches both sides.</strong>
    <p><p>The more I browse this sub, I see that this concept is really difficult for some people to comprehend. </p>
<p>Most people misunderstand propaganda because they believe the term only applies to information that is misleading or untruthful. This is absolutely not that case. Fact and truth is actively being weaponized against you. </p>
<p>Leftist agenda, for lack of a better term, was never supposed to be logical. It’s meant to invite confrontation from people with the ability to think critically.  Once you fall into this trap, you expose yourself. You will be labeled as the enemy, when in reality you may share many of the same beliefs with those attacking you.  The current political climate is not left versus right or Democrat versus Republican, it’s those who can question the narrative versus those who blindly eat it up. </p>
<p>We need to understand that left-wing propaganda and right-wing propaganda come from the same source.  What you consider the “truth” is being dangled in front of you like bait for a fish. Every time you see a ridiculous and nonsensical headline from the left, and you confront it with logic, you are biting the hook. But rather than get reeled in, you will be pushed into the depths. You will be silenced. This is the agenda: to censor critical thought and reason.</p></p>

        <p>The people who control and profit from this "pandemic" are the problem.  They can operate freely  if everyone is too caught up in politcal affiliation to pay any attention.  It's the same crap of people wearing masks only because they don't want to be labeled a Trump supporter.  Or the surveys that state most of the people not getting vaccinated are White male Republicans.  It's all misdirection.</p>

        <p>Very well stated and this post needs to be higher.</p>
<p>The fact is absurdity does not deserve to be argued against; by even raising argument to it, you legitimize it.</p>
<p>The reason we’re so tempted to interact and shout out against the propaganda is because it is constantly and deafeningly blasted at us from every source of information available. </p>

        <p>I'm not sure if I get your point.
Are you saying that, instead of reacting to propaganda by pointing out what I think are the incorrect premises of it, I'm supposed to ignore it, so no-one knows that I belong to the people who can recognize propaganda?</p>
<p>If that is the case, I have to disagree. I think that if no-one would speak out against it, then people would think they are all alone and could not band together in order to support their resistance.</p>
<p>Knowing that there is other's who haven't lost their ability to think critically and their courage to publicly do so, has helped me tremendously in coping with the situation.</p>

        <p>This is a valid concern. But truthfully, most people are conditioned to delegitimize your argument.  Just think of how it feels to talk to somebody with a bad opinion; we will listen to them, but we never see their argument as credible, so we don’t try to relate with whatever they’re saying.  Confronting somebody who is misinformed, and especially confronting somebody online, is just as good as talking to a brick wall. Frustration and fear shut down the parts of our brain associated with comprehension.</p>

        <p>I have taken several courses on communication-psychology and have a lot of experience in talking to people with a different opinions.
Thus, in my experience, it is very well possible to have a conversation that inspires people to reconsider their opinion, if you know how to communicate.</p>
<p>You say that "we don't try to relate with whatever they're saying". Right there you named one of the most common mistakes usually made in unsuccessful dialogue.
This is something in our power to do something about. And it's actually not all that difficult. All you have to do for the other person to perceive you as relating to what they are saying is paraphrasing and interpreting their statements and then ask an open-ended question for them to further elaborate on what they said. It is very important to avoid showing any form of contempt when you do that. Without much experience you will probably still need to suppress your contempt but the more you do it, the less contempt you will experience in the first place.</p>
<p>By doing this you signal that you are taking their opinion seriously and at the same time make them more open and even curious to hear about your opinion and how you reached it.</p>
<p>The result of properly "executing" communication is very rarely frustrating or fear-inducing. Quite the opposite actually. It usually ends with all participants feeling better about having had this conversation.</p>
<p>So the other part that is important next to doing the "active listening" I described earlier is to pre-phrase your own conclusions as your opinion and your thoughts rather than facts.
By not calling them facts, you avoid getting the other person into a defensive mode, where they just try to refute everything you say instead of listening and showing curiosity.</p>
<p>I think it is very unfortunate that proper communication-techniques are not taught in school. At least not in mine. I think if more people were aware of the possibilities, there would be much less frustration and conflict.</p>

        <p>I consider contempt, first and foremost an emotion. An emotion that we don't have much control over feeling.
In the end it probably comes down to biochemicals being released based on recognizing patterns where we were in similar situations and felt better about ourselves.</p>
<p>What we do have control over is what we do with it, when we recognize that we are feeling it.</p>
<p>And here it comes down to what our aim is for how the conversation shall go. When I started consciously suppressing my contempt in online-conversations, it has lead to results I didn't consider possible before.
Conversations that turned from slinging insults to people actually opening up and talking in depth about how they think and feel.</p>
<p>Toxic communication is an automotive cycle, that can only be broken by not participating in it. According to my teacher it can take up to about 5 times the amount of non-toxic messages to break a cycle of toxic communication. So being persistent about avoiding partaking in it is important.</p>

        <p>&rt; the kind of people that can discuss things without losing control of their emotion don't take up a large percentage of the population</p>
<p>&rt; In my opinion, people place more importance on their own emotions today than they ever have. Emotional control takes time to learn, and takes practice... neither will be spent without good reason.</p>
<p>I definitely agree with both of these statements. A point that I find particularly intriguing which I hadn't really thought much about is that you mentioned that neither time nor practice will be spent without good reason.</p>
<p>I must admit that I didn't really have that incentive either until I witnessed someone who had mastered this. It just amazed in a way that could be described as jaw-dropping. Not sure that this alone qualifies as "good reason". But it was basically what inspired me to engage with it myself.</p>
<p>I guess the experience of learning and practicing it can be compared to "getting good" at a game. Except that in this case, being "good at this game" seems much more applicable in all sorts of aspects of my life compared to what I can do with my knowledge of the Zerg vs. Protoss-Matchup.</p>
<p>Of course it is highly subjective what people will consider as toxic or nor. I thought quite a bit about how to better define certain words for myself so that at least my own definition is a little less vague.</p>
<p>For example I like my own definition of the word "insult" a lot better than the definition from Wikipedia. Because by following my definition, you won't "accidentally" insult someone.</p>
<p>"Labeling someone in a way that they haven't labelled themselves with and likely wouldn't label themselves with."</p>
<p>So while I probably "could get away" with that and not being perceived as "toxic", not doing that at all kinda guarantees that I will never be perceived as toxic.</p>

        <p>I agree. Listening is huge. Unfortunately when they start parroting the CNN talking points I lose my patience because I see they are heavily brainwashed.  Because I have heard the same talking points a million times and I'm tired of going in circles with these people I have given up on them. But I do agree if a person has more patience and they actively listen it is possible to make some meaningful headway in a conversation.  I just lack the patience at this point.</p>

        <p>You mentioned being tired of going in circles with these people.</p>
<p>Can you elaborate how you usually did respond in a situation where someone parroted CNN talking points?</p>
<p>Maybe you can find a different way of responding that doesn't lead to these aforementioned circles and thus doesn't tire you as easily.</p>
<p>In my experience, a great way to make conversations deviate from each other is asking open-ended questions, that everyone will answer differently based on their personal experiences.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>"What have your personal experiences with the pandemic been like?" or "How have you imagined a pandemic to be like before covid?"</p>

        <p>When it's something like the LGBT, sure because while you might engage in a polite debate why there is no such thing as trans people, suddenly they shift the conversation do a rant on Bi-phobia and then it shifts to Manual gear identifying dragon drag kings.  </p>
<p>But the problem with officially accepted narrative, people pretend they understand them, go along with it because it makes them feel smart, if you attack their intelligence merely with mockery they will simply bite down in their "own truth" and are even more deadset on never letting go of their idiotic programming</p>

        <p>Well said, I find this with my father who shuts me down every single time I bring up anything that questions his worldview, we agree on many things, like the same humor "A muslim woman was riding by on a bike and my dad saw her and as she was riding away, he made like a gun hands and said bang! His girlfriends was like, dude you can't do that, I said, well I rather he does bang bang! Than she goes boom!" But yeah this pits people against each other, those who want to be free and those who believe if we just wait a little longer we will get our freedoms with no effort</p>
