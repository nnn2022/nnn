    <strong>My long distance GF is crumbling under the vaccine pressure and I feel it's going to finally tear us apart</strong>
    <p><p>I live in Northern Europe, she lives in Philippines. Last two years have been tough for us because we've been unable to physically meet. When I met her the world was more open and I was looking forward to seeing her often and travelling the world together. </p>
<p>By the way, I love this girl and have been clinging to the hope of having a real future with her. Not just trough video calls. </p>
<p>So, while it hasn't been the easiest lately, now with the latest developments with the vaccine passports, things took a turn to the worse. Philippines is known to have had one of the harshest lockdowns and she is now afraid she wont be able to go to buy food without the vaxxport and her school is probably going to be requiring it as well, so bye bye education. She is seriously considering it again. I previously managed to talk her out of it when her boss was being difficult about it.</p>
<p>I've tried to talk with her and told her it's up to her and it's not necessarily going to be easy but she must choose her side. I don't want to be a dictator in the relationship and I feel for her because she has less wiggle room than I have if SHTF because the country is already struggling with poverty and corruption. But in my heart of hearts I know if she takes the vaccine, things will never be the same again. Even if she has no adverse effects, the philosophical divide will probably be too much to handle. I need a partner that has the attitude of "us against the world" if need be. I can't conceive loving her like I used to if she chooses to be on the side of pro-newnormal. </p>
<p>So, yeah things aren't looking so bright. Hopefully there's some light shining soon because I feel a lot of hopelessness these days.</p></p>

<p>An ex-colleague of mine, involved in nation-building in Eastern Europe after the fall of the Soviet Union, said you have to make a distinction between those who collaborate and those who collaborate with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>You seem to think your girlfriend is the latter, but in truth she's not even the former: she's only 'seriously considering' the vaccine after her job, education, <em>and life</em> were threatened (Duterte is a nut). That's hardcore, and if you're too impractical a purist to appreciate it you'll lose the most valuable ally life has given you so far.</p>
<p>I'm not anti-vax personally, but do want to increase the level of anti-establishment capacity in the population as a whole, and this I'm-so-ideologically-pure-I-must-rule-out-all-realistic-options approach? Nah; get rid of it. Too many well-meaning people have wasted themselves on that.</p>

<p>Trust me, I don't think so at all and I don't understand how my words can be construed like so. I said "I feel it will tear us apart". That's completely different than saying I've given up on her. She has been struggling with the issue for a long time, I know that much. She doesn't like the idea of getting vaccinated. She knows about the ill side effects, but she might struggle with the philosophical side of resistance.</p>

        <p>Your words were construed that way because you said there is a 'philosophical divide' if she 'chooses to be on the side of pro-newnormal.' But a coerced choice isn't a choice. There are death squads in the Philippines. To be holding out at this point means she is as hard as a coffin nail. If you really want a real future with this women, find some way of getting her to safety or getting yourself out to protect her.</p>

        <p>Deaths squads? I heard a cop shot a farmer last year over a mask issue but I've never heard anything about death squads. EDIT: things aren't <em>that</em> bad in PH yet, to my knowledge. There's a lot of areas that people simply don't care about the mandates, and surely enough there's been protests in Manila. There is resistance in Philippines, although the general attitude seems to be the under the nose masking "let's just hope it goes away".</p>
<p>Your words resonate with me. I'm of the stance of "over my dead body". But I can't expect the same from her. I want to protect her but I don't know what to do. My resources are slim. She's on the other side of the world and the borders are closed.</p>

        <p>Duterte has threatened to shoot or jail the unvaccinated, and from him it's a credible threat.</p>
<p>The only way I can see to protect her (without knowing the ins-and-outs of your jurisdiction) is to propose marriage and begin passport or visa applications. Even if you aren't serious, goons think twice before touching someone with potential foreign citizenship.</p>

<p>I don't know. Duderde has a lot of bark but the truth is PH is a poor country and so their government is poor too. It wouldn't be the first time Filipinos got tired of their political elite and killed them. I hope Duderde gets what's coming to him soon. He's crossed a lot of lines and stepped on many toes.</p>

<p>This is like asking the prison warden to let you go free if you beat him in his own game. Perhaps not the best example but fighting the bureaucrats with paper doesn't seem to be the best road to take. It goes against my ideology to fill in marriage documents with nation states involved too, so nope. Next idea please haha.</p>

        <p>So you're going to hold it against her that she is being forced to get vaccinated?  I'd be more concerned about her health and safety long term if she recieves the shot, as I am with my Filipino wife.  </p>
<p>She was mandated by the hospital she works for to recieve it.  She doesn't have a strong policitical viewpoint or opinion on the whole matter, but I inform her of both sides of the scenario as much as possible so she can make her own decision.  Me myself, I am like you and will put up a fight, even if it means losing a chunk of what I have.</p>
<p>Can't side with you on holding a personal grudge over her personal decision.  She's supposed to forfeit every opportunity she has future state just to please you?  I don't get it.  Wish the poor little Filipino girl luck, standing up to their unforgiving careless government.</p>

<p>Please don't mangle my words like this.</p>
<p>I'm not going to hold a grudge against her, no matter what. I know it's difficult. I've lost a lot too because of this.</p>
<p>But I know if we stand on different sides on this issue, it's going to be rough. I can't expect her to be on the same side with me, she has to make her own decision. But I can't promise things will be just the same if she is compliant to the other side either. It's not easy.</p>

        <p>Yeah if you can't handle a difference as mild as getting a vaccine or not, you're definitely not cut out to have a long term relationship with anyone - let alone someone from another county or culture.  Imagine the litany of differences you'll have on things that actually matter and impact your lives as individuals lol.</p>

        <p>You're kind of making my point for me lol. It's her body, so if she chooses to get a vaccine, it seems like a weird thing for you to break up with her over. I think getting this vaccine is incredibly dumb, personally - but I would never divorce my wife if she decided to get it. It's just not my prerogative.</p>

        <p>Okay, so it isn't your prerogative, but perhaps you live in the belief that things will simply get easier and the oppressors and tyrants will just stop? They wont and time to take a stance has long past. You don't seem to understand how serious this is and how serious things are going to be soon.</p>
<p>But that aside, it seems to be really hard for you to sympathize with me. So let me turn it on you. Surely there is something your wife might do with her own body that would make you lose your love for her? Or are you telling me no matter what she decides to do, you will keep her? Even if she cheats on you? Even if she starts shooting heroin? Even if she murders someone?

<p>I mean if her country is going berserk with the vaccine mandates, that seems like even less a reason to hold it against her in my opinion. </p>

<p>Not really. I'd be pretty pissed if she just let herself go - but that's a lifestyle difference that would effect every aspect of our relationship. Not her choice to get a shot. </p>
<p>&rt;Or are you telling me no matter what she decides to do, you will keep her?</p>
<p>Weird choice of language here. I don't own my wife lol. </p>

<p>If you can't see the difference between what you just described and getting a vaccine shot, I guess it makes sense that your entire relationship is over Zoom and you whack off every night into a sock.</p>

        <p>That is sad to hear. But when it comes to "us against the world", are you with her?
This lockdown has been hard, especially on Southeast Asian countries. Talk to her about your views and see if she can wait it out till it's completely mandated by the government. Else bring her to your country, take the responsibility if you love her so much. If she's a sheep then there could be a philosophical divide. But if she has to take it to just live her life then she might be in a emotional turmoil herself. Step up and care for her if that's the case.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the thoughtful comment.</p>
<p>I've been looking at the options all year and hopefully we can find something. Shit might really hit the fan there, but how can I promise things will be any better here? Just see what's going on in France. There are couple of big hurdles though. I'm not the wealthiest and she's even less so. That's the toughest pill to swallow. Secondly, it's really difficult to leave Philippines even in regular times. The visa process is tough and sometimes they just randomly detain women trying to leave the country. It's not at all what we've been used to in our western countries.</p>

        <p>Show her this:</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">CDC itself admits</a> that only 6% of the <a href="https://covidusa.net">1.8% CFR</a> of COVID cases die from COVID alone, and they have changed the way they report deaths so that <a href="https://www.who.int/classifications/classification-of-diseases/emergency-use-icd-codes-for-covid-19-disease-outbreak">anyone who dies with COVID in their system is counted as a COVID death</a>. Aside from COVID, these deaths are often reported differently—if someone had, say, tuberculosis, but they died of complications from uncontrolled diabetes, they would be listed as a diabetes death. Now, if you replace “tuberculosis” with “COVID,” it’s suddenly a COVID death. (Yes, I know it’s mostly American data it everything is some version of the same all around)</p>
<p>Aside from the inflated death numbers that still lead to an actual CFR of .108%, which is almost exactly the same as the flu’s .13%, it’s not a good idea to get the vaccine for the reasons discussed in <a href="https://www.deconstructingconventional.com/post/18-reason-i-won-t-be-getting-a-covid-vaccine">this essay</a>.  In addition to this, <a href="https://themostbeautifulworld.com/blog/vaccine-studies">here</a> is a list of scientific studies showing that every previous attempt to make a vaccine for <em>any</em> coronavirus has ended disastrously, often with most or all of the lab animals dying, and that previous coronavirus vaccines have been shown to lead to complications such as liver damage, prion disease, and cytokine storms on exposure to variants. As seen in the essay, there is no evidence from the data released by any COVID vaccine company that any of these problems have been resolved in this latest attempt at a coronavirus vaccine.</p>
<p>In addition to this, <a href="https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/thousands-of-women-report-hemorrhaging-reproductive-dysfunction-miscarriage-after-corona-shots">the numbers with regard to fertility changes in women</a> strongly suggest that the vaccine has a negative impact on fertility and on pregnancy, which is congruent with <a href="https://dailyexpose.co.uk/2021/05/04/pfizer-confirms-covid-vaccine-shedding-leading-to-menstrual-cycle-disruption-is-possible/">what vaccine companies already knew was possible, even prior to release</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, a <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577">large study</a> of the “safety and efficacy” of the vaccine has a huge hole in it—they merely vaccinated participants and then hoped and prayed they would come into contact with the wild virus by chance. But there is no guarantee of exposure—far from it—so there is no actual test of safety OR efficacy, when you consider that most lab animals in previous coronavirus vaccine trials (which were systematically exposed to the virus they were vaccinated against) died of ADE, especially if they seemed to develop perfect antibodies.</p>

The hospitalization rate of the unvaccinated is higher simply because the COVID test for a vaccinated versus an unvaccinated person is different. The one for the unvaccinated uses an <a href="https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/health/documents/cedep/novel-coronavirus/Ct_Fact_Sheet.pdf">RT-PCR Ct value between 35 and 40</a>, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html">even Fauci admits produces a useless result, that is, a 40-90% false positive rate</a>. The one the vaccinated are given, on the other hand, uses a much more reasonable <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/Information-for-laboratories-COVID-vaccine-breakthrough-case-investigation.pdf">RT-PCR Ct value less than or equal to 28</a>. What this means is that many unvaccinated people are actually being misdiagnosed when they go to the hospital, whereas far fewer vaccinated people are.</p>
<p>Here is a list of studies showing masks don’t work:</p>
<p><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">A May 2020 meta-study on pandemic influenza published by the US CDC found that face masks had no effect, neither as personal protective equipment nor as a source control</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/">No evidence for the effectiveness of cloth masks against virus infection or transmission</a></p>

        <p>Thank you!!! You don't believe I've been bombarding her with facts about this for such a long time and we've been having conversations around the issue before. She's also a very busy woman and doesn't have time (and perhaps interest) to do such an extensive research over these things as I do.</p>
