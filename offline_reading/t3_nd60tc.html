    <strong>The brainwashing isn't allowing me to see my daughter...</strong>
    <p><p>...because her and her mother live in propaganda state, and I'm in a state that hasn't given shit since it all started.</p>
<p>I got the dreaded text last night, "are you getting vaccinated?" </p>
<p>"Why no, I'm waiting for the testing to be done since we're the control group."</p>
<p>"Is anyone else in the house going to be vaccinated."</p>
<p>"The only one who got it or is getting it is my step mom."</p>
<p>No reply. She's caught between using this as a way to control my daughter, but I know she wants a break to go travel. She assumed she'd be able to keep my daughter at her grandparents house but unfortunately my dad isn't stupid enough for her, so she can't do what she did last year and say she has to stay with him the whole time.</p>
<p>And she signed my daughter up to get the shot since she's 12 and they just started offering it to 12-15 year olds.</p>
<p>I told her if she has her shot she's safe, but then she mentioned she could still get sick. I shrugged. If you're stupid enough to prove yourself wrong in a conversation and still believe what you're spewing then what can I do? Guess we'll be zooming this summer.</p>
<p>7/4/21 UPDATE: Well. She got side effects. Fever, runny nose, soar throat. 2nd jab and it hasn't gone away. Not sure how many days she'd had it now.</p></p>

        <p>Uh, but what if she makes your daughter take the shot and she gets seriously injured or dies? Can't you protest and tell her that you oppose your daughter getting a shot?</p>

        <p>I have, but she has full custody so I can't do much. She's almost old enough where she can decide where she wants to live but she grew up in a bubble. She was a princess for her entire life and I had to be the only person that was ever real with her.</p>
<p>The irony in all this is that she needs permission from both parents to get a piercing. I had to get a notarized form with my permission on it.</p>

        <p>Oh I'm sorry, well I hope in the end she doesn't take the Pfizer or Moderna ones. The AZ and J&amp;J shots are slightly different, but there's a chance of blood clots or a heart attack. Either way, I think none of them are safe. I pray everything will work out for you and your daughter/loved ones.</p>

<p>I'm floored by all this shit. We went to the zoo last week without masks (son, his mother and I) and right down the street at a gas station we couldn't go in because they required masks. The hypocrisy has no bounds. </p>
<p>Like, what happened to sanitizing everything? I guess the mask is enough now? Cause social distancing was never a thing, but you couldn't find sanitizer for a while.</p>

        <p>If I had a 12 or 13 year old, I‚Äôd forbid them from getting a vaccine, even if they wanted it.</p>
<p>If I had a 14 or 15 year old, I‚Äôd make it clear to them that I disapproved of them getting vaccinated. However, I might ultimately allow them to get vaccinated if they kept insisting. Would be a tough call.</p>
<p>Actually, no, I take that back. Assuming that we‚Äôre talking about the US here, with privatized health care, I‚Äôd forbid my child from getting vaccinated as long as they were on my health care plan. I don‚Äôt want to have to pay for their potential vaccine injuries, which are almost impossible to sue for.</p>

        <p>Thats hard for me to do, cause a) I already told her I wasn't going to get it and why, and b) she's a master manipulator and will see it coming. She taught me when we were kids. Its been a long ass time but she's still pretty sharp. </p>
<p>The silence today tells me she's probably still pissed she couldn't rely on my dad whos also not getting it but ultimately if she doesn't bring her down it'll ruin her plans. Last year I think she went to New Orleans I think.</p>
