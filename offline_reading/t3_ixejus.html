    <strong>Pandemic Travel Dilemma bringing up Old Traumas</strong>
    <p><p>Just venting somewhere safe where nobody will be upset with me. </p>
<p>We had a baby in August.  Both sets of baby’s grandparents are 3000 miles away. </p>
<p>My dad said “I just a had a stroke (in February 2018), I don’t want to catch Covid.” He doesn’t want us to fly out in October to see them. He’s afraid we’ll catch something on the plane and make him sick. Even though the chance of catching Covid from a plane is about the same as any other public space, and he’s never been concerned about me going to the grocery store. </p>
<p>Kinda brings up old rejection wounds, like how neglectful my dad was for so many years. </p>
<p><strong>Nothing, not any virus, could keep me from seeing my child. So why doesn’t he care to see me?</strong> This rejection stings. </p>
<p>He’s lived a long life, 85 years, cheated death multiple times. He’s had lung cancer twice AND STILL SMOKES! <em>And now he’s suddenly concerned for his health?</em></p>
<p>I wouldn’t care about visiting the old fart but I can’t see my mom unless dad agrees because they’re married and live together. I miss my mom. </p>
<p>If dad dropped dead, everyone would be happier. Access to my family is always held hostage by this alcoholic POS. </p>
<p>We are respecting everyone’s wishes. It just hurts.</p></p>
