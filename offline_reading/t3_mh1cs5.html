    <strong>Hearing this too much lately when it comes to Vaccine passports. Especially Americans.</strong>
    <p><p>When it comes to vaccine passports and “showing your papers”, even mask mandates, it seems Americans have a different idea than the rest of the world. </p>
<p>Americans hate that the government may bring in a vaccine passport, but then cheer a private company doing it. Every place you go to IS a private company. So if EVERY business decides on a vaccine passport then technically they have done the governments bidding for them already. </p>
<p>This goes the same for mask mandates. I just saw a video a lady in Texas having the cops called on her by the church for not wearing a mask. She was socially distanced and had a 6 month old baby with her. The cops came and took her away.</p>
<p>Now Americans will cheer at this because “it is a private company” and can do what it wants. So where is this going to end? When EVERY company has a mask mandate and vaccine passport to enter a place, then why are Americans upset if the government does that? Especially air travel. You can’t take your business elsewhere. The USA needs to seriously  rethink “it’s a private business” mantra as it just does the governments bidding.</p></p>

        <p>Nobody who is against mask mandates is cheering private businesses mandating them.  No one who is against vax passports is cheering businesses using them.</p>
<p>You are reading things from pro mask and pro vax passport people.</p>

        <p>My point is I hear many centre right pundits like Dinesh Disouzza and republicans say this. Even on this sub I see it around. “It is a private business it can do what it wants”. How can a private business ask for a medical record? When every business does it then the government doesn’t have to.</p>

        <p>That's because statist right wingers have a boner for private corporations and they refuse to say or do anything to undermine corporate power, even if it infringes on individual liberties. We don't have a real libertarian political power base in the US.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I think despite many things I appreciate about the US, you're pointing out s blind spot.</p>
<p>One of the few good things left about the UK, is certain laws and protections, for example a business cannot have a policy that discriminates against disabilities.</p>
<p>So a shop/church can't say - you're not coming in without a facemask, as we have exemptions in place for medical and mental health reasons. To deny access would be disciminating against their illness - which is obviously wrong.</p>

        <p>It seems they are happy for big tech and private businesses to have your medical vaccination card, records and have to show them just to eat a meal or see a show and they think nothing of it. But heaven forbid the government ask for it even though they are the ones that probably already have that record.</p>

        <p>They changed the definition of fascism to just some generic "right-wing" boogeyman when they knew they might lose the 2016 election. America has been quasi-fascist and increasingly so since at least WW1.</p>
