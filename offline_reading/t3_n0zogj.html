    <strong>A rebuttal to "their death was unrelated to the vax they took recently"</strong>
    <p><p>Suppose you hire some workmen to come to your house and do renovations. They're building a bathroom in one part of the house, and they need to turn off the water for a while to do the plumbing. They finish the day's work and the new bathroom looks great, but you when you turn on a tap in another room, it's not working properly. </p>
<p>Do you </p>
<p>A) Call the workmen back, because you believe they must have done something to cause the other tap to break while they were working on the plumbing? </p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>B) Assume that the problem is totally unrelated to the major plumbing work you just had done.</p>
<p>Suppose you go out to dinner at a new restaurant. Your food tastes nice and you have a great time, but a few hours later you're throwing up. </p>
<p>Do you </p>
<p>A) Conclude that you had food poisoning and avoid that restaurant in the future.</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>B) Assume that you just had bad luck that day, and make plans to visit the restaurant again soon. </p>
<p>In life, we can very rarely be <em>certain</em> why something happened. But that doesn't mean that our lives are totally random, or that we should act as if they are. Generally people look for the most likely explanation for something. That is what they will believe until somebody can present even more convincing evidence that some other explanation is true. I want people to stop telling me that this highly logical thought process is wrong. Undoubtedly some of the vaccine deaths were unrelated, but not all of them. And if somebody died after living their lives as usual, with the exception of taking an experimental medication, then the odds are that that's what caused it.</p></p>

        <p>The argument is extremely simple:</p>
<p>Deaths should be counted consistently. Anyone who got covid and died within 28 days was labelled a covid death and the hospitals got paid more for them.</p>
<p>Same standard should apply for vaccines. Anyone dies within 28 days of taking a vaccine is a vaccine death and the hospitals should get the same bonus they got for the covid case.</p>

        <p>This reminds me of some work I got done on my car. Tiny crack in the windshield. I go to pick my car up a few hours later, open my car door and it makes an awful squeaking sound. I just stood there confused because it never made that noise before and they only worked on the windshield. I kept opening it and it kept squeaking, but I figured they'd call me crazy or assume I was lying. The squeak eventually went away. I figure some heavy man must've leaned on the part near the door opening while fixing the middle of the windshield, but it really freaked me out at first, especially the part where I thought they'd consider me crazy or a liar.</p>

        <p>You're having an argument that no one else is having.</p>
<p>No one is saying the vaccines haven't killed anyone. They're just saying that it's exceedingly rare. Something in the range of one in a million or two.</p>

        <p>Not true. I've seen many doomers post in here about how so-and-so didn't die from the vaccine, that it's just a random coincidence that they dropped dead out of nowhere after receiving the jab, that it was "just their time".</p>

        <p>Well, that will often be the case.</p>
<p>200 million or so Americans have taken it. Given that thousands of us die every day, it's automatically true that many people will take the vax and die a few days later.</p>
<p>If 5 million people watch an episode of Southpark on Monday, chances are 25 or so of them will be dead by next Sunday. That doesn't mean the Southpark episode killed them. That's how reasoning works, sport.</p>
<p>When I said OP is having an argument no one else is having, I was referring to the fact that the CDC freely admits the vaccines will kill a tiny minority of people. </p>
<p>What you're doing is inventing a kind of person called a "doomer", and then automatically deciding who they are and what they believe, and then having an imaginary argument with an imaginary person who you invented.</p>

        <p>You also have to take into account, is the type of reaction and the possible mechanism of the injury consistent with the vaccine.  I can't think of any mechanism where watching South Park could cause death.  I can think of one where the vaccine can cause a blood clot, platelet activation.  Or one could cause myocarditis and renal failure, autoimmune response similar to MIS-C.</p>
<p>One way to prove causation is to see if the incidence is higher than population norms.  However, there has to be an accurate accounting of the deaths and their causes.  Trust in the medical authority is pretty low right now because it seems discussion has been replaced by censorship and conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>In other words, we've been lied to in the recent past.  So, it's hard for us to believe an authority telling us something is safe when it appears not to be on the surface. Most of us just want the facts instead of propaganda.</p>

<p>&rt; And if somebody died after living their lives as usual, with the exception of taking an experimental medication, then the odds are that that's what caused it.</p>
<p>You're saying that if 1 million people all died after taking the vaccine (and continuing to live their usual lifestyle), then only 1 of those deaths would be related to the vaccine?</p>

        <p>Actually, last I checked the CDC’s position is that, after investigating all reported deaths, not a single one was caused by the covid vaccines. </p>
<p>Not a single death - not even the deaths caused by a combination of conditions that is so rare that prior to these vaccines there were only a handful of known cases in the world, and that is inexplicable (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in people who not treated with heparin - the condition that led to a brand new term: vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia, even though this particular variety of thrombocytopenia is brand new has ONLY occurred with the covid vaccines, no other vaccines). </p>
<p>Even though, as you correctly point out, every vaccine (and drug) will in fact kill some tiny number of people. </p>
<p>Not a single death.</p>
