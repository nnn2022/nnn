    <strong>Association of State-Issued Mask Mandates and Allowing On-Premises Restaurant Dining with County-Level COVID-19 Case and Death Growth Rates — United States, March 1–December 31, 2020</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7010e3.htm">Association of State-Issued Mask Mandates and Allowing On-Premises Restaurant Dining with County-Level COVID-19 Case and Death Growth Rates — United States, March 1–December 31, 2020 | MMWR (cdc.gov)</a></p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>Despite the fluffy language at the beginning, the numbers show that mask mandates and restaurant restrictions have almost no effect on case and death counts.</p>
<p><strong>A little more detail, if you don’t want to read the study. Excepts from study below:</strong></p>
<p>During March 1–December 31, 2020, state-issued mask mandates applied in 2,313 (73.6%) of the 3,142 U.S. counties. <strong>Mask mandates were associated with a 0.5 percentage point decrease (p = 0.02) in daily COVID-19 case growth rates 1–20 days after implementation and decreases of 1.1, 1.5, 1.7, and 1.8 percentage points 21–40, 41–60, 61–80, and 81–100 days, respectively,</strong> after implementation (p&lt;0.01 for all) (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7010e3.htm#T1_down">Table 1</a>) (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7010e3.htm#F1_down">Figure</a>). Mask mandates were associated with a 0.7 percentage point decrease (p = 0.03) in daily COVID-19 death growth rates 1–20 days after implementation and decreases of 1.0, 1.4, 1.6, and 1.9 percentage points 21–40, 41–60, 61–80, and 81–100 days, respectively, after implementation (p&lt;0.01 for all). Daily case and death growth rates before implementation of mask mandates were not statistically different from the reference period.</p>
<p>During the study period, states allowed restaurants to reopen for on-premises dining in 3,076 (97.9%) U.S. counties. <strong>Changes in daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates were not statistically significant 1–20 and 21–40 days after restrictions were lifted</strong>. <strong>Allowing on-premises dining at restaurants was associated with 0.9 (p = 0.02), 1.2 (p&lt;0.01), and 1.1 (p = 0.04) percentage point increases in the case growth rate 41–60, 61–80, and 81–100 days</strong>, respectively, after restrictions were lifted (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7010e3.htm#T2_down">Table 2</a>) (Figure). Allowing on-premises dining at restaurants was associated with 2.2 and 3.0 percentage point increases in the death growth rate 61–80 and 81–100 days, respectively, after restrictions were lifted (p&lt;0.01 for both). <strong>Daily death growth rates before restrictions were lifted were not statistically different from those during the reference period, whereas significant differences in daily case growth rates were observed 41–60 days before restrictions were lifted.</strong></p>
<p>Keep in mind these percentages are not absolute. They are percentage decreases in the rate of case/death count growth. Imagine a mandate that slows growth rate by .5%. You'd be laughed out of the room!</p>
<p>Have a nice day!</p></p>

        <p>Not really.  That adds up, compounds.  Progress is progress.</p>
<p>Let's say we do have a mandate that reduces cases by 0.5%</p>
<p>Week 1: 100 cases<br>
Week 2: 99.5<br>
Week 3: 99<br>
Week 4: 98.5  </p>
<p>WE'LL BE BACK TO NORMAL IN NO TIME!!!!</p>

        <p>Read my last paragraph. These are not absolute numbers. It is very deceiving.  The mandates resulted in a .5% decrease IN THE GROWTH RATE over the associated period. Example: let’s say from day 1-20 cases grew by 100 people. That would mean masks made the difference of a half of a person over 20 days. Now see why it’s such crap?</p>
