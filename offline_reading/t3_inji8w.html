    <strong>Masks, in this novel taking the form of painting one's face with charcoal, clay, or blood, represents the hiding of the civilized self and the donning of savagery</strong>
    <p><p>From enotes:</p>
<p>&rt; Initially, Jack paints his face with various colors in order to make himself blend in with the natural environment better.  </p>
<p>&rt;“For hunting. Like in the war. You know—dazzle paint. Like things trying to look like something else—”
He is the lead hunter, and Jack knows that he has to find some kind of an advantage over the prey that he is hunting. He figures camouflaging his face and his scent should do the trick.</p>
<p>&rt;Unfortunately <strong>for basically everybody, the mask not only transforms Jack's appearance, but it also has the adverse affect of transforming his demeanor and attitude.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;He looked in astonishment, no longer at himself but at an awesome stranger. He spilt the water and leapt to his feet, laughing excitedly. Beside the pool his sinewy body held up a mask that drew their eyes and appalled them. He began to dance and his laughter became a bloodthirsty snarling. He capered toward Bill, and the mask was a thing on its own, behind which Jack hid, liberated from shame and self-consciousness.
Notice how Golding tells the reader that Jack is no longer himself. He is a complete stranger to the boys and to himself at this point. Notice also how his joyous laughter quickly changes to bloodthirsty snarling. Along with the word "sinewy," the passage is likening Jack to an animal, not a man. Lastly, the passage indicates that the mask is in control, not Jack. The mask is a "thing on its own." <strong>The mask now controls Jack, and he is no longer inhibited by shame and self-consciousness. Basically, he is now free from morality and guilt. This moment marks the point in the story where Jack embraces his sadistic climb to power over the remaining boys.</strong></p></p>

        <p>Oh yeah this is from <em>Lord of the Flies</em> if there was any question. Which autocorrected to Lord of the Flues when I first typed it, which is fitting.</p>

        <p>Lord of the Flues.  I love it.</p>
<p>This is actually the third Lord of the Flies reference I've read on reddit this morning.  A cultural meme in the making?</p>
