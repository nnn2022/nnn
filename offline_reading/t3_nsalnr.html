    <strong>Community was Dying Already in America, now it's DOA and they want it gone.</strong>
    <p><p>I have a personal blog but wrote about how community was dying in America. Some of you may live in other countries but there's tons of people in America even before all this stuff happened who have no friends and deal with extreme loneliness. I am dealing with the fact that outside of my husband, my life is extremely void of people outside of the internet. </p>
<p>Even if I wanted to go live life normally, there's no one to visit with and everyone here got vaxxed.  I moved to a super small town in the late 90s and lived there for 8 years. Ironically this town is mega against lockdowns and most of the place are refusing the vaxx.  I left the impersonal big city and liked rural life a lot. Sadly it was economically destroyed and I had to move here. I remember back then being able to talk to people, and having actual "community." Friends and I who were in that area, meet up on Facebook sometimes and almost cry over how things "used to be". Some told me life was never as friendly again. They had to move away too and a lot of people died young. [the place had an extreme poverty rate even years ago]</p>
<p>Many of us don't have families, didn't have children or had families that just moved away from each other, and there's no community there either. We have these lives devoid of social ties. I was in some community groups but Covid destroyed them all. Some continue via Zoom but it is not the same. I can tell some probably are not coming back. Remember when Richard Putnam wrote his book Bowling Alone, and talked about how people in America no longer had friends, they even had that article out.</p>
<p>I am disabled and on autistic spectrum so this did impact things for me but I can't keep help from thinking the powers that be, want community and social ties dead, they want disconnected consumers who get everything through the media, instead of "word on the street" and well they have achieved that.</p>
<p>I lost everything from a stamp club to art class to in person interaction with a liberal church here. Since now two years has passed, all those social ties have been destroyed except for the liberal church.</p>
<p>It is hard to explain to people the loss of a community it's almost like a death in itself.</p></p>

        <p>Well said.</p>
<p>I'll add this has been going on for years.  Unstable employment means picking up and starting over several times.</p>
<p>Feminism taught women to fear and hate men.</p>
<p>BLM taught blacks to hate whites and whites to fear blacks.</p>
<p>Liberals now  hate conservatives. </p>
<p>If the people were united and we had a strong middle class pulling together,   government would obey us.</p>

        <p>Thanks.</p>
<p>I wrote how we are turned into economic nomads. I became disabled but even I at one point had to move to a giant city for a job [alone] not to be homeless. We were forced to move over and over. I want to move now because of our lack of social ties--only the liberal church even kept me here, but husband has told me he is tired of moving and "starting over". I understand. All I saw was the back end of people. People who are poorer are dying younger too, not everyone is making it to their 80s, I am Gen X and have a lot of friends who have died in their 40s and 50s. </p>
<p>I have problems with feminism even as a leftist, I can't stand Steinem, the bosses were more oppressive than the husbands.</p>
<p>I support antiracism but now see BLM as a corporate sponsored diversion that won't really change anything, the ghetto areas where I live are reaching new levels of despair and economic suffering.</p>
<p>I regret my own division from politics, yes divide and conquer they got that down. I agree about what would happen if people were united. They have set up everything to separate people.</p>

        <p>The ultra wealthy have used divide and conquer for over a thousand years.</p>
<p>The only difference is now its in overdrive. </p>
<p>Middle class against the poor, vaccinated against unvaccinated, white against people of color,  conservatives against liberals, straight against gay, men against women, old versus young, law and order versus whatever the opposite is.</p>
<p>We had the largest wealth transfer from the middle class to the ultra wealthy in history the last year and couple months.</p>

        <p>Look into the mouse utopia experiments. That is basically what is happening in big cities and urban areas. As overpopulation increases, so does social decay.</p>

        <p>Except that there is NO evidence of overpopulation anywhere in the world today. Nowhere: Not even in China, not in India, etc.</p>
<p>The problem is that the governments of the world are refusing to provide for their populace.</p>

        <p>People are going to have to move to rural smaller communities if they want any chance of being able to connect with other people in the future again. I grew up very rural. We knew all of our neighbors, friends with them, played in their yards as kids, took care of their animals, shared food like chicken eggs and stuff. We helped each other and had each other's backs if shit went bad, I had a car breakdown when I was 18 that would have costed like $1500 to fix, and one of my neighbors did it for like $200 because we were a community.</p>
<p>Lived in large cities for nearly a decade after college. That mentality just doesn't exist in the city. There's too many people, people get in the way, some people are dangerous. You're taught to avoid people generally because if someone is trying to get your attention they are either trying to sell you something you dont want or get something you dont want to give them. </p>
<p>Just in one year, because of covid, that mentality has doubled, tripled. </p>
<p>One upside of increased remote work is that more people have the ability to do this now. People need to start spreading out if they have the ability, because problems in dense urban environments are really ramping up, and when shit really hits the fan, people are gonna have to work together with their neighbors to make it. People are gonna have to learn how to be people again to survive.</p>
