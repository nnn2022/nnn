    <strong>Gluttony is a deadly sin</strong>
    <p><p>Parents for the several years: eating ice cream and getting fat</p>
<p>Parents for the last year: continuing to eat ice cream, sitting indoors, wanting me and my generation to be locked down, and completely prevented from thriving, meeting, starting careers, communities, and families etc etc</p>
<p>Parents now: "We understand this must have been really hard on you.."</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>I tagged this as a rant post but I just want to say, if you have the autonomy to do so, don't be afraid to be honest with yourself about how vile people can be, how consumed by sin they can be, and how full of malice, such that they betray the familial trust, deeply. One has to measure them as anyone else, and not cling to family, and not fear taking the solitary path.</p>
<p>Our libertarian attitudes towards sin have really fucked us over in the long-run it seems. It was decades of "do whatever you like in your own home!". This is the template for authoritarian takeover; wait until a critical mass is so deeply entrenched in sin, then enslave them, and then instrumentalize them in psychologically torturing and persecuting the uncorrupted souls who still remain.</p></p>

        <p>Straight and narrow is the way. I agree. This is all a spiritual problem. Not stated near enough. A massive call to repentance is needed. When priorities of the people change, the world will change.</p>
