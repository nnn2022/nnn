    <strong>So, I went out to the pub tonight...</strong>
    <p><p>So, my sister and her boyfriend are up visiting me in the North East from London and wanted to go out to the pub. I really can't be arsed with the idiotic mask shit so was happy to wait until the pubs re-open properly but this has been the only chance I have had to see my sis for ages. (She works for the govt and has to appear to take all this cretinery super seriously)</p>
<p>I can report it was surprisingly good. All the pubs had Covid BS signs outside but NO ONE, and I really mean NO ONE was playing along with this crap. Not one person was wearing masks when entering/exiting or standing up in the pubs. No staff were wearing them, no one was paying the slightest attention to social distance diktats, it was all pretty much 'normal'.</p>
<p>The nicest thing was twofold:</p>
<p>1) We stopped to grab a shawarma on the way to the second pub and the guys in the kebab place were lovely; properly friendly and welcoming, none of this "STAND BACK FROM THE COUNTER" hysteria. We joked and laughed, got our kebabs and staggered on to the next pub.</p>
<p>2) When we arrived at the door of the pub, we stopped to finish our food and so I could have a smoke. The owner came out of the pub and told us we were more than welcome to eat inside. Again, no masks, no hysteria, just pleasant welcoming attitude.</p>
<p>EDIT: I apologise if this is a little hard to read but I am a little bit 'refreshed'. Dortmunder rules!</p></p>

        <p>yea welcome to the real world :) - most people going out aren't really buying into this - even in the US in California - maybe in the most urban areas but in the outskirts/suburbs most people (especially those going to bars) are very much ignoring it - as much as possible - I had a chat with a bartender a few weeks back saying it was all BS and showed me a picture he took with the former head of the CDC (Robert Redfield) that had visited his restaurant a few months back - said the man didn't wear a mask the entire time - maybe vaccinated, but this wasn't really a topic of the day just yet.</p>

        <p>yea I think the public messaging and the constant goal post moving totally jumped the shark on this whole thing in the minds of many many people - more so than it looks online I guarantee it. In fact, I'd argue that online is what keeps people fearful about opening up - there's many many people who find this whole thing a bunch of covid tainted baloney</p>

        <p>Redfield is the guy who said "wearing a mask might be "more guaranteed" to protect an individual from the coronavirus than a vaccine", whatever <em>that</em> means.</p>
