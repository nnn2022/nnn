    <strong>The simple reason why opposing the "New Normal" is common sense for the 99%</strong>
    <p><p>You have heard what the WEF, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the Wellcome Trust, the Rockefeller Foundation, the UN, WHO and all other supranational institutions and their goons have proclaimed their agenda is.</p>
<p>Even if you believe that humanity should pursue technologies that threaten the core of what our existence has always been, you must realize the track record of the oligarchs who are offering you the "salvation" to problems they themselves have created.</p>
<p>They have always had the power to improve your life. Instead they have carried out plans to hurt you and worsen your conditions over decades. Whatever good may grow on the mountain of corpses the globalist mafia has created, it will not be for you. If you make a deal with these devils, they will destroy you and give you a life that is a fate worse than death.</p>
<p>Do you think the 9/11 insider traders sleep well at night? They have detached themselves from their own humanity. Injecting mRNA today and brain chips tomorrow is no loss of humanity to these narcists and psychopaths. They cannot lose what they no longer have.</p>
<p>If you believe a higher power controls the universe and punishes such vile actions, you already made up your mind and know where you stand in humanity's darkest hour.</p>
<p>If you are agnostic or atheist, you will still see that your personal material losses from supporting the agenda will outweigh any possible gains. It is a humanist thing to understand that it is better to suffer injustice than to do injustice to your fellow humans simply because every harm you do to the community is harm that you ultimately do to yourself.</p>
<p>It is therefore common sense for billions of people to oppose the "New Normal".</p>
<p>It is a moral obligation, a spiritual duty and a simple act of self-preservation.</p>
<p>We are all in this together. Nothing could ever divide us when we are united under the human spirit.</p>
<p>Our true identity is that of survivors. Hundreds of thousands of years we have endured ice ages, hunger, disease, tyranny and every time we have emerged alive. We are connected to all who have come before and will come after us. A thread of fate binds us together in this infinite universe. We are one, not in the Klaus Schwab hive mind but in the joy and dread of the human condition.</p>
<p>All we ever will be is human. A digital copy of a human will never be a human, just as a painting of a pipe will never be a pipe.</p>
<p>And I am happy with that because your joy is my joy and your pain is my pain.</p>
<p>Let us use technology to serve humanity. Not to enslave it.</p></p>

        <p>As the governmental authorities have encroached into our lives things have only gotten worse. Our kids are illiterate, our citizens are fat, our workers are lazy, people complain about having no jobs but don't think to create their own OR the red-tape is so obnoxious that they can't. Our soldiers go to war that never ends, to ruin nations whose populations then flee into ours. If you go into too much debt you are punished, but the Governments are trillions in debt and keep spending (in my mind, there at least could be a law that says if the debt exceeds X amount then all taxes stop, or are reduced to 1% or so. Not an economist. Just spit-ballin').   </p>
<p>Not to knock Trump or anything. But if your voting options are Hilary, Trump, or Biden. Then your political system sucks. Some may be better than others, but damn. I'm in Autralia and our selections are barely decent. Morrison is a pansy.   </p>
<p>Point being. Government sucks at everything that it touches.</p>

        <p>Sadly, I do think government are somewhat organic. It is better to have a hierarchy among a population since some people are better at some things than others. Some people might have great building skills, and others might have good organizational or planning skills. Having leadership in a group also helps the group to act efficiently and in the same direction.  </p>
<p>Not that I disagree with your disdain for Government in contemporary forms. It isn't just these current governments but all forms of governments across time that function in the same manner. The centre of power has become out of reach of the population. It's gross for sure.</p>

        <p>True. I think the issue occurs once the "elite" become out of reach of the population. In Monkey hierarchies they can just beat up the jerk top-chimp. haha. Not to imply violence against people. You can say "this is why we vote" but I don't consider a handful of bad choices to be... a choice. </p>
<p>I dunno. Too many layers, is what comes to mind. I have been toying with Christianity as a form of politics, so-to-speak. Not that I am avidly Christian or anything. I got the idea when I was trying to understand how the 10 commandments function.</p>
<p>Fundamentally the idea is, you round up a bunch of commonly held ethics and values within a bunch of people. Simple and obvious - don't kill, steal, etc etc. Then you turn it into a character aka. God. Kinda how we look at Constellations and get the in-built narrative of the character. God = these sets of ethics. Worship the God you worship the ethics that are implied. </p>
<p>You make these ethics into a character and then you stick it riiiight up the top of the hierarchy. King of all existence across all time ever. Then you stick in a few other rules about being faithful to that God, just to make things a bit more cohesive. Worshipping other God's endows you with their own sets of ethics, which makes you different from your group and causes issues. Change the top of the hierarchy and everything underneath that has to change. We can see this with modern politics today. </p>
<p>You have a character embodying your groups ethics. You agree to worship this God (because this increases its value in your mind). And then every potential leader, king, manager, bossy sister etc. has to either be in alignment with the God or be ignored. You don't need someone telling you what to do because you already have God and you have an easy-to-follow list. Pretty simple stuff. </p>
<p>It is a system that stops tyrants and corruption, for the most part. Doesn't stop these people from existing. Just lowers the chances of their power taking hold.   </p>
<p>Again, not to say Christianity is correct. Nor to insult those that are religious. Just saying from a pragmatic standpoint, it seems interesting to consider. I think Christian Anarchism is a decent model of a society - enough rules to keep things orderly, but enough personal freedom to stop oppression.</p>

        <p>Yeah. I mean... considering how many bad managers I have had in my working life. It might not be a matter of Government. Just humans being in authority. People just kinda suck sometimes. I wish I knew what the answer was. My thinking is to revive higher ethics (like religion without the dogma) in our societies to hopefully give a better foundation to the culture. But whether that will truly help. Hard to say.</p>

        <p>I give you a lot of credit in doing so.  Society as a whole, has gone to shit, in regards to respect for each other, work ethic barely seems to exist anymore, lack of morals and so much more. 
Things are completely different now than when I was a growing up many years ago.   In “85 “ as a teenager, I made up my mind to never bring a child into this world, out of fearing what was going to come.  Looking at our world in the last 25 years, I definitely made the right choice.</p>

        <p>I fear I might draw a similar conclusion. I really want a family and I adore kids. Heck. The world 2 years ago was manageable, in my mind. I am not afraid to bring them up in something like that. Not ideal but do-able. But now? I don't even know what my life will look like anymore. It's not completely off the table, for me. But I share your worry. I am contemplating an attempt at starting my own version of church (based on a deeper analysis of mythology and theology with Christian foundations. But without the fanaticism)  in my local community and try to fortify what I can.</p>

        <p>I would agree with that. The real ticket would be to figure out how we could have said hierarchy without the corruption. Set it up in such a way that it would be a true sacrifice to be in that position, not a position of power and wealth only for the elites. I've always said we need better people in politics, but personally I would NEVER want to be involved myself... so there I am, kinda a hypocrite. Most of the people drawn to political position, are power hungry greedy types. If we could change it so that there was no power/money benefit that would draw in those types of folks, we would probably see some real change.</p>

        <p>I am not christian, or religious. I was just playing around with the 10 commandments after a growing interest in the cultural mythologies that inform the West.</p>
<p>Turns out that religion (Christianity in this case) can be used as a system to prevent corruption. And really. This isn't a "believe in God/Jesus for your salvation". No! Not at all. I am talking purely pragmatic. I was reading the bible from the perspective of someone that was trying observing the tyrannies at the time and was trying to create a philosophy that would prevent it.</p>
<p>It is a long discussion, but here is the basics: You figure out what the patterns are. When people do X things get worse, when people do Y things get better. We can call this an emergent ethic. Like how we can determine an ethic from watching a pack of wolves hunt - you can clearly see the way they organize and strategies on a hunt etc. We see emergent ethics across many species. </p>
<p>Then the assumption is placed that doing the beneficial things is what is best. You can see this with pain. The pain we experience drives us away from some actions and towards others. Therefore, the human organism must evolutionary want to do the non-pain things.</p>
<p>You bundle up these observations and create an archetype and we shall call it "God". We quantify those emergent ethics in a list known as the commandments, among other things found in the Bible. It is a theologically informed declaration of independence, like freedom of speech etc. </p>
<p>Then you stick this archetype of values riiight up the top of your hierarchy. Hierarchies form because we can observe more expertise in others and it is more efficient to have them lead or teach, than not to. In this instance, we would collectively agree that those values are of utmost importance and supersede all others. Therefore, it goes at the very very top. </p>
<p>Then we say that this "God" exists across all time, dimension, and space. Is intrinsic to all creation. This prevents people from undercutting the authority granted to the God. You can't have new ideas, or different ideas etc because God did it already. No need to fix what ain't broken, so to speak.</p>
<p>Every form of leadership thereafter must submit or be in alignment to the ethics of God, or be exiled and ignored and granted no authority (thou shalt no have other God's). Because if you shift the locus of your "worship" you start to take on the value structure of that thing. But because humans or systems (political leaders, the state, environmentalism etc) can change, it means the cultural values keep shifting. Some flexibility is good (which is granted in the 10 commandments) but too much causes fracturing within the group.</p>
<p>The 10 commandments essentially say: The archetype of ethics known as "God" is the highest authority. We shall not replace this authority with other things or people. We shall commit to some ritual in order to remain focused on this. We value homogeneity within our community - shared beliefs and values. Thou shalt not take thy lords name in vain means do not act righteously as a means of doing destruction - road to hell was paved with good intentions. Respecting thy mother and father ensures the sanctity of family across generations. Thou shalt not commit adultery ensures trust bewteen families and spouses. Thou shalt not kill, steal, or bear false witness prevents distabilization within the community and ensures collective safety (bearing false witness is readily illustrated in communist countries). </p>
<p>It prevents the need for a king or government in regards to rules and conduct. Perfectly fine to have experts and leaders though. Gives enough of a framework to create stability within the community, and enough boundaries to prevent chaos. God cannot change its mind. The ethics are set and hold true across all space and time. </p>
<p>Once again, this is NOT making the case for Christian conversion, salvation, getting into heaven. You can do this with rationalism, science. You just need an agreed set or rules, and make those RULES into "king" and put them above all else, so that way if someone comes along proposing a better solution you can recognise it as corruption. "Hey gang! you should let me rule. Vote me in!" "Nah dude. we already have a thing"</p>

        <p>I remember that Pizza place that told the Corpo competition that "love" was the secret ingredient of a superior pizza. There are many things in society that are made with abuse and hatred and the plandemic is the best example of that. A manufactured crisis to subdue and murder innocent people. I think antiganda to that should also come from the heart, like that superior pizza made with love back then. Tastes better, yes? </p>
<p>Hatred is too bitter to be wholesome.</p>

        <p>My point exactly. As long as we are individuals, we have our own goals and objectives, as we each are on our own, separate journey. Hence, there is no "common" good. There's the individual "good" of each individual. Sometimes they overlap, but to a certain degree. To be able to attain "common" value, one would have to flatten the individual into a grey mass. We can still strive for a common goal, if enough people find it worth pursuing.</p>

        <p>Any company per se including more than one person in order to achieve a common goal is exactly the opposite what you write, keeping in mind the futility of common good among all. The issue you are bringing up is with the idea of a LIMITED LIABILITY company, one where the individuals are stripped of the responsibility for their creation.</p>
<p>Remove the limited liability altogether, and it's as close to "some common ideals of some certain individuals coming together" as it can be.</p>

        <p>I agree, we need to stand against the use of technology for our enslavement. These elites are sociopaths, either archon/Satan/ or lac of conscience driven or all of the above. They are destroyed our lives, the world and the environment. I think how things were, when I was young and even with a horribly abusive family, there was far more joy and hope in the world and these bastards are stomping it all down. Everything is about domination and punishment in this world and it's getting horrific. Sadly religion is a tool they use, and use to their own benefit. I believe there is a God/Source or higher power but they use religion at their disposal too.</p>

        <p>Truth nowadays is like receiving  a bitter soup when you have been expecting a dessert for years.</p>
<p>Then once you have it, the world has a real flavour, and real desserts start appearing instead of the false Matrix virtual chicken.... but the most horrifying bitter/sour cactus like taste needs to be taken first, </p>
<p>so most prefer the virtual chickens.</p>

        <p>you should post this onto as many social networking sites as you feel comfortable with, this is truly powerful and well-worded. nothing is more important right now than informing the ignorant and standing in solidarity with other humanitarian free thinkers. the positivity in this post is deeply appreciated, even invaluable.</p>
