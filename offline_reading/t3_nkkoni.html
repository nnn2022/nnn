        <p>That’s a really sad picture. :(</p>
<p>And I agree with the post 100%</p>
<p>If Bill Gates for example was truly a philanthropist, wouldn’t he be trying to end world hunger and provide people with access to clean water?</p>
<p>Instead of talking about eugenics, funding unnecessary sketchy vaccines, and rubbing his hands together in glee at the thought of an even worse pandemic?</p>

        <p>No, we aren't keeping Africa in the dark because of their skin color.  That is such an ignorant and brainwashed point of view.  I don't pretend to know all of the reasons that we will keep them in the dark but none of the reasons are skin color.  The most obvious is that they are competition - I've heard better reasons that I can't now remember.</p>
<p>Also, China doesn't want to control us because they are white.  Though they do have pride in their nationality and race and so good for them on that point.  They also want to control India, Pakistan, Turkey, the whole of Europe.  Not because of skin color but because they want to control the world.</p>

        <p>“Competition”... that are “different from us.” </p>
<p>You seriously don’t believe the most powerful people in the various political parties around the globe aren’t massive racists? It’s the oldest story in history. A belief in racial superiority is the only explanation for the atrocities we commit on each other on a daily basis. Why in the world do you think the Chinese CCP wants to rule the globe? Why do you think the East and the West sit by and give tacit approval to all of the bio-experimentation that goes on in Africa? What in creation do you think could have been the motivation behind the Holocaust or the American eugenics experiments? Even Joe Biden proudly claims authorship of one of the most racist pieces of legislature in American history. Tribalism and pure bloodlines are at the center of almost all of this bullshit, don’t be naive.</p>

        <p>Everything boils down to power not racism.  The Chinese elites are in bed with white elites of every country.  Classism is the problem, not racism.  It's the elites we are up against and those elites happen to be from all races.  Also white america would be a lot better off if it stopped self mutilating, and apologizing and if they had a bit more pride in themselves, the way that every other race and culture on the planet does.</p>

        <p>Yes but that lust for power has an evil root somewhere. Slavery is an ancient practice. Eliminating racism (tribalism) is one of the important elements to humans elevating their own consciousness and treating people with love and respect instead of fear and violence.</p>

        <p>is your response to this massive racism to lie down and say "nooooo i like all races!"?</p>
<p>conservacuckism will conserve nothing, dear friend. and even if you rally around this race-libertarian-egalitarianism, even if you "win", the moment other races have freedom to rally against you and become racists again, they will <em>jump</em> at it because they haven't been indoctrinated into self-apathy.</p>
<p>muslims don't suffer from their racism. the chinese don't suffer, hispanics don't suffer, blacks in Africa and otherwise don't suffer. why then do you think you would suffer?</p>
<p>you are close to the truth when you say "racism" is the issue, but i think your obvious ideals of eliminating it from the world are the true naivete on display. perhaps, instead, you should re-analyze the entire concept, and find out exactly which way the issue goes...</p>

<p>Dude. If I was a tyrant. I would wanna go down in history like "duuude! I ruled them so hard we advanced in quality of life by a billion percent". Y'know!! Jesus didn't get his place in history by being an asshole. Hell, Marx was an asshole and the only thing that people know about him is his shitty philosophy. Barely know the dude. Hitler is kinda fading too, only his ideology lingers. But everyone knows Jesus, Buddha, Gandhi etc.   </p>

I've barely seen other news than COVID in 2020 and 2021. Even BLM and the Palestina vs Israel conflict didn't receive as much attention as COVID.</p>

        <p>Do you think asking for "sources" on things that are easily observable - but you're well aware there haven't been any "studies" on - is some kind of "checkmate, gotcha" question? </p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>You want me to cite a source on <em>mentally ill</em> people getting vaccine tattoos and posting creepy as fuck videos? You're on the internet already. You want me run up and down the internet for you finding all the official public statements where they tell you to your face that they're inflating the covid numbers, so you can be <em>dishonest</em> and make excuses for that?</p>
<p>Or have you decided to admit that you're just plain <em>dumb?</em></p>
<p>What is it? There are literally only three options. And I'm not using "literally" figuratively. Those are <em>literally</em> the <em>only</em> three options if you still believe the narrative. </p>

        <p>Nope, just asking you to show what things back your statements, I don't need citations of mental illness or things that are apparently easy to see, that's how making a claim goes, you make a claim have something to back it up, easy...

        <p>I like how you tried to pattern your responses after my previous statements. That was cute.</p>
<p>But as you'll quickly realize, we're not the dipshit redneck flat-earthers the media likes to paint us as.  </p>
<p>It's pretty clear you fall under the "dishonest" category. You already know walking in here that you don't have a logical leg to stand on, and sunk cost fallacy has you desperate to confirm the narrative in the most <em>transparently flimsy</em> way possible. </p>
<p>You don't even know what you're asking for. You're just knee-jerk asking for "sources" so you can you say you don't trust them, all while you don't even realize what's being discussed. </p>
<p>For fucks sake, I sincerely wish <em>just one</em> doomer would come in here with a coherent, logical viewpoint. </p>

        <p>I'm not interested in challenging you, I want to see one thing that separates the word salad coming from your keyboard from simple opinion based on other people in the same social media circles, I'm legitimately interested in where these opinions come from but have yet to be shown anything as a citation that doesn't include either "just google it yourself moron", "It's really obvious to see" or "whatever you wouldn't believe it anyway because you will believe anything"... I'm not assuming you are redneck flat earthers but so far I haven't seen anything to sway my opinion other than what is very obviously nothing but baseless opinion that just looks like paranoia</p>

        <p>None of us here were convinced by any one piece of evidence that this "is what it is" so there's no source to be had.  We've had our eyes open from day one and seen one distortion of the truth after another.  </p>
<p>You see this for what it is, you'd just rather not admit that.  You lie to yourself because otherwise this is almost too painful to stand - too unbelievable.  It challenges every other thing you've ever been told or believed.  You aren't just being lied to about covid......</p>

        <p>you asking for sources is asking for a year and a half of different articles, personal claims, videos, companies public announcements, statistics, etc.<br>
we're not fucking computers mate.<br>
plenty of people have given plenty of sources over time.<br>
people like you discount the sources, even if they're from the very same companies that you like to listen to.  </p>
<p>that's why the response is how it is.<br>
it's blatantly obvious this whole thing wasn't ever really about a fucking cold virus. it's about money and power, as it always is.</p>

        <p>So you have nothing to show as to the reason you hold this opinion? Even though there's a year and a half of heaps of different things? Look, it's ok if you believe this stuff because you know people who believe this stuff and they say the same things but you should own it at least. To me it's blatantly obvious that you have nothing but a social media echo chamber, I've been asking for details behind why this stuff is 'the truth' for a while now out of genuine interest and all I'm getting is the same response... Nothing.</p>

        <p>you're fucking deluded.<br>
I've seen tons of sources on here, theres been less recently.. mainly because of what I said.<br>
why should we be digging up every single bit of damning evidence for you?</p>
<p>all you'll do is somehow claim we're crazy conspiracy theorists, and then cite some bullshit mainstream media, the same media paid for by the fucking pharma and government lying to you.  </p>
<p>it doesn't take any sources to look around and realize the whole worlds fucked and it's because of politics, money, power. NOT a virus.</p>

        <p>First off thank you for actually providing something I can read through, they seem to have a lot of quotes and snips of Twitter and using themselves as citations which makes me suspicious but I'll definitely have a good read, secondly, settle down princess, I'll keep asking for citations as long as people keep making claims that are counter to what I know, that is how Burdon of proof works, you assert something, you should have something to back up that assertion. Thirdly your rant about pharma paying for your media may be true but this is a global pandemic and there's only a few countries that don't have universal healthcare, most of the planets hospitals are run as hospitals not as for profit companies so none of that applies outside the U.S.</p>

        <p>That's not how Burdon of proof works, this sub is asserting the government is lying and/or the virus isn't real or doesn't kill or isn't bad and or vaccinations are going to kill us all but provide only screenshots of social media as evidence, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, I came here with a genuine interest in seeing the issue from both sides and I have received so little in return I'm wondering if majority here actually have looked into this or just believe because everyone in the group has the same meme from the same Twitter account... I mean I am sure there is more to it than that but any time I ask someone to share knowledge I get insults and told to do my own research... That doesn't seem to be a logical response from an area with so much overwhelming evidence it's all so obvious the first response is to insult someone's intelligence for asking what makes you believe that.</p>

If you can’t see what’s going on you have no common sense. The reason you believe the shit going on is because there’s millions of articles about covid 19 and they’re mostly all propaganda.</p>

        <p>Debunking the federalist with a biased fact check website that is supposed to detect media biases? Oh, that is rich. </p>
<p>Fact is that the CDC allowed the teachers union to lobby them and dictate their guidance for school reopenings when even the likes of Jake Tapper can read the data and understand that schools should have reopened. Emails surface and then Schuchat decides to step down. Hope she enjoys her retirement.</p>

If the Gates Foundation actually gave two shits about kids they'd dump the vaccine racket and go into water purifiers, irrigation and sanitation.

<p>Interesting that the article shows that more lives are lost due to lack of sanitation than diseases but that pesky sanitation just isn't a priority.  We can shut the world down over the common cold but millions of deaths due to dirty water? Well fuck them right?</p>

        <p>Agree, and while the suffering of children is worse around the world remember there's kids in America too, who have no health care, or decent food, live in dangerous neighborhoods, or remote rural ones with few services and these creeps all want to fill them up with a poisonous shot, for a disease they have little to no danger from. What is happening to the kids is so criminal. Hell we see kids here, scared because their stupid brainwashed parents want to force an experimental shot on them. These people don't care, they are openly destroying the world and the future. They will start another war more kids will die in too.</p>

<p>Realistically majority of people ignore the water crisis here as it won't affect them and hurts those in poverty.</p>
<p>I'd be all for poverty alleviation, but that also doesn't work through philanthropy. Philanthropy is buying good will for poor results, without fixing the underlying problem.</p>

        <p>You forgot the most important part, that's 1400 children in 3rd world countries.  Not the US.  So they don't give a fuck about them.  Children die every single day because of horrible living conditions, undrinkable water, scarce food, limited or no access at all to dental or medical care...  Most politicians just skate right past it like "Well, that's not here, so why should we care?" meanwhile packing "stimulus" bills with billions going to countries for "Gender Studies Programs".  I want to see, just once if it's not too much to ask, a congress that puts Flint, MI in check, making it a public health crisis and getting their water issues resolved, then passing legislation that overhauls food stamps and government assistance.  When children are only able to get a meal on school days, that's a serious problem and needs to be addressed.  Overhauling government assistance to include drug testing for those on government aid to ensure the money is being spent on food and care for the person and children instead of on drugs/alcohol.  Also, CPS overhauls to bring in more resources and workers to be able to do monthly or even weekly checks for those kids in the homes of those on government aid.  We should also be sending Farm Aid boxes sent weekly to those on government assistance with children including vegetables, canned goods, bread, cheese, food stamps that must be used with a government issued ID to purchase things like dairy products and meat, while removing soda, chips, and unhealthy food from the accepted foods list for food stamps.  </p>
<p>There's a LOT that this country could do to step up and help bring about an end to starvation and horrible living conditions.  It starts at home.  We must take care of our own first, and lead by example, THEN we can begin trying to help solve the problems in the rest of the world.</p>

        <p>Most people doesn't care about real issues. They care about a virus with 99,97% survival chance. COVID, COVID and COVID. Why? Because of it's fashionable and modern. People wants to be fashionable and modern. They think it's woke. Anything else is old fashioned.</p>

        <p>Also, just for some real facts. According to Unicef "Some 2.2 billion people around the world do not have safely managed<em> drinking water services, 4.2 billion people do not have safely managed sanitation services, and 3 billion lack basic</em>* handwashing facilities." Not sure where the figures or claims come from in the original post. Do you still think its about educating people and having empathy for those less fortunate?</p>

        <p>Do you realize how expensive it would be to build desalination plants, water treatment plants, wells, etc... for 2.1 billion people in areas with little to no infrastructure to support them let alone maintain them for decades. And that’s not even mentioning how dangerous it would be because lots of drought areas are war zones as well</p>

        <p>Absolutely not. The lockdowns compounding effect has killed more people than the virus itself. The top wealthiest 100 people in the world, have a combined wealth of over $100 Trillion. So technically 1% of the top 100's wealth would provide food, water and shelter to everyone in the world. There are around 780 million people without access to clean water, right now, today. If we rounded that up to 1 billion, we'd have more than enough to build infrastructure to give them fresh water forever. </p>
<p>They don't want to fix the worlds problems, because they firmly believe they are elite, and the rest of us use "their" resources, therefore we must be culled... or left to suffer and die. </p>
<p>Remember, they really do want half of us to die over the next few decades. As crazy as that sounds, it's happening already. Just look at our sperm counts. Most of us will be sterile by 2050. That's less than 30 years away.</p>

        <p>Sooo let me get this straight... </p>
<p>We shouldn't worry about vaccinating our populations from a highly contagious virus because poverty still exists worldwide? </p>
<p>You all need to decide what your priorities are. And not use real horrific realities like this just to hit home a political point with no interest in actually changing them for the better. Actually doing something about this would require a shit ton of money and resources that no government or company is interested in spear heading, because the returns would not be monetary.</p>

        <p>You misunderstood my post like a typical covidian.</p>
<p>It's not about whether we care or not. It's about everyone - companies, billionaires, celebrities, politicians and so on suddenly so obsessed about saving lives when covid isn't that fucking deadly and it's twice as harmless as the flu to CHILDREN. </p>
<p>So why rush and vaccinate kids against something that poses no risk to them, instead of focusing our effort elsewhere, where it would be needed more?</p>
<p>And why are we ok with people dying from literally anything else as long as it's not muh precious covid? Why? Don't you think that concern about saving lives seems a bit forced on us and fake when there's so much death and suffering these same people choose to ignore? I mean really, whats going on in your doomer brain and do you honestly think this is just about saving lives? Because I have serious doubts.</p>

        <p>You can always tell when someone is out to have a cheap, dishonest take on something when they immediately bust out these bullshit insult labels. "Covidian"? Give me a fucking break. I accept the reality that we've been in a worldwide pandemic for the past year and that we're taking measures to get it out of our lives. </p>
<p>It's important to start talking about when to vaccinate kids against covid. It would just be one more vaccination on the pile wouldn't it? Most of us are vaccinated against  a party bag full of diseases before we're allowed to start public school anyway. </p>
<p>And who said we are ok with everything else terrible besides covid? But you're right, if covid was only in the places like the one in that photo, it wouldn't be a priority at all. The fact that it is such a priority is because it's gumming up our everyday life here, where people think they're entitled to whatever they want whenever they want it. If this was in one of the places you're referring to where people starve to death daily, our institutions would overall, not bat an eye.</p>

        <p>I haven't taken a vaccine for anything in probably 25 years now. Not since middle school. I'm not scared of micro machines in the vaccine or any conspiracy like that I just haven't felt a need for it. Just saying not everyone get vaccines as an adult. In fact from personal experience I don't know any adults that got vaccines before Covid. I know some people get a flu as an adult I just haven't met any of them.</p>

        <p>That's why the UN created the sustainability development goals, I. E Agenda 21 in 1992. The goal post was 2030. Clean water for all and no poverty what so ever (amongst other amazing but unrealistic goals, in my opinion) but somehow those goals ended up as a conspiracy theory. </p>

        <p>Medical rationing during times of crisis is nothing new. Especially in capitalist economies which "ration" there services daily to those who cant afford. Although the term ration isnt used, since the private health insurance doesnt care about health, but profit. If there were perhaps a better way to organize healthcare to reduce its material shortcuts......which all result in more spending from the public sector. Im well aware many Socialists are against lockdown.....I wonder how Im aware of such.</p>

        <p>No. the united states has plenty of money to spend turning Palestinian kids into skeletons. There is more than enough money and resources to help the sick and needy many times over. Now as a philosophical question if rationing does need to occur for some circumstance (severe shortage, war etc) than that is a more complicated situation to infer. This whole situation is to blame on the American healthcare system, which I want reformed. I may sound hostile, but on this point we are in agreement. The methods we beleive may differ tho</p>

        <p>I suppose I did make a strawman, yet being on this sub and being right wing are heavily correlated. So thats the reason I did such. And thats understandable, I only give myself a label at times because I have to. Sticking to 1 specific label to consider yourself I dont like, and im trying not to do. Its a way to self coerce oneself into being narrow minded.</p>
<p>My impression of this sub is quite negative, I think its just as bad to be a Covid cultist or a Covid denialist. I disagree with lockdowns becuase having the state enforce relatively arbitrary restrictions on businesses is detrimental to the economy. If we had a 2 week complete lockdown with rent moratroiums and unemployment back in June then that wouldve been a different story.</p>
<p>So I agree with you lockdowns are inefficent and harmful to peoples well being. But I do think Covid is a genuine problem aswell, I think people should make an effort to distance themselves from eachother to avoid the spread. But not  just choose not to in some dumbass "muh freedom to infect other people" shit. </p>
<p>If I may ask, what issues do you take with Corona situation? Is it mostly the lockdown?</p>

        <p>&rt;If I may ask, what issues do you take with Corona situation? Is it mostly the lockdown?</p>
<p>I genuinely believed in the lockdowns in the very beginning because I had the impression that the thing is extremely contagious, floats in the air for a couple of hours even outdoors and we really need to reduce the pressure off the hospitals and the doctors and nurses. I saw it as a short time sacrifice, I harassed my parents to stayhoom and I didn't even do my favourite harmless outdoor activity for almost 2 months. But I knew from the very beginning that the thing poses no threat to me and my age group in general, and I would need to be extremely unlucky in order to die. It was all about protecting others.</p>
<p>So naturally cases went down when the summer came, I started going out more, again, just doing harmless outdoor activities, no parties or anything, and I thought the whole thing was over... Boy was I wrong.</p>
<p>Autumn came and the lockdowns came back, more harsh than the first one, and the overwhelmed hospitals argument was still used despite the governments having plenty of time to prepare. I started reading more and more as I was out of my doomer phase in July last year. The measures were ridiculous and humiliating, we were being treated like children and nothing made sense. Masking toddlers, mandatory hotel quarantine, mask in the car, people fined for sitting on a bench etc etc. And places that stayed somewhat open and didn't see a high death rate got ignored by the media. I started to agree more and more with the so called conspiracy theorists, as their predictions started to come true, and to disagree with the average lockhead. I realized that if I agree with any of this madness they won't stop but they'll come up with something new instead, like the boiling frog effect, where everything is happening slowly so before you know it its too late...</p>
<p>Then the vaccines came. I thought great, we have vaccines, this will be over soon. The promise was to vaccinate everyone over 50 and then gradually open up. Well it didn't happen. But we're getting vaccine passports soon, and kids are bribed to get vaccinated with ice cream. The whole thing smells and I wish more people would see it. </p>
<p>TL;DR: Too many things about this whole story seem pointless but in a deliberate way, as if by design. There's too much harm done already and I don't believe one bit that it's all about health and saving lives..</p>

        <p>I agreee with you on the dislike and distaste of how the virus was handled. I was in a similar situation. I dont beleove the state genuinely cares about the population, and the media works to make money off sensationalism so that doesnt help. In some broadstrokes I agree with some points that the people on this sub make. But for every "wearing mask in a car is pointless" theres a "5G implant chips", "Vaccine conspiracy" undertone which I find..... </p>
<p>I fully agree I think much of the handling of the virus is political, the state and media working together never really produce something nice.</p>
<p>I hate to sound like a nasty centrist, but it really does suck that there is only the most extreme of ends on the situation.</p>

        <p>A couple of points, first, there is a fundamental misunderstanding of the public health point behind vaccinating children against COVID here - it has very little to do with preventing children from dying, and it has almost everything to do with protecting at-risk groups who are unable to get vaccinated due to medical conditions; an unvaccinated child could easily asymptomatically spread COVID to one of these people, who would then be at immediate risk of serious illness or death. </p>
<p>So in that regard, it is about saving lives, both those of at risk groups that are medically unable to be vaccinated, and of an albeit nominal amount of children. </p>
<p>Second, even assuming an infinite amount of goodwill, resources and no corruption on the part of the US, fixing the global water crisis is not something that this country could accomplish alone. Encouraging vaccination to the public to reach a certain percentage of vaccinated citizens is, however, something the US could accomplish alone. This makes it silly and unhelpful to compare a domestic vaccination drive to our initiatives to fix the global water crisis on a policy level.</p>
<p>So if anybody can explain to me how vaccinating children wouldn’t save the lives of those medically unable to get the vaccine and/or explain to me how it’s fair to compare a completely domestic policy goal to one that would require immense amounts of international cooperation then I would very much appreciate it.</p>

<p>Because there's still no evidence of asymptomatic transmission and/or its extent. All the supporting scientific "evidence" you'll find is:</p>
<p>a) Flawed predictive models with flawed inputs that don't represent reality.      </p>
<p>b) Prevalence studies that say "there are asymptomatic cases <em>ergo</em> there must be asymptomatic spread".    </p>
<p>c) Studies or commentators that insidiously put asymptomatic and presymptomatic in the same category.  </p>
<p><em>Our estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic cases and their risk of transmission suggest that asymptomatic spread is unlikely to be a major driver of clusters or community transmission of infection, but the extent of transmission risk for pre-symptomatic and minor symptomatic cases remains unknown. The generalisability of the overall estimate is unclear, and we observed considerable variation across the included studies, which had different settings, countries, and study design, reflected in the reasonably wide prediction interval.</em></p>
<p>https://jammi.utpjournals.press/doi/10.3138/jammi-2020-0030</p>
<p><em>It’s also unclear to what extent people with no symptoms transmit SARS-CoV-2. The only test for live virus is viral culture. PCR and lateral flow tests do not distinguish live virus. No test of infection or infectiousness is currently available for routine use.678 As things stand, a person who tests positive with any kind of test may or may not have an active infection with live virus, and may or may not be infectious.9</em></p>
<p>https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4851</p>
<p><em>All close contacts of the asymptomatic positive cases tested negative, indicating that the asymptomatic positive cases detected in this study were unlikely to be infectious.</em></p>
<p>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19802-w</p>
<p><em>We found significantly higher secondary attack rates from symptomatic index cases than asymptomatic or presymptomatic index cases, although less data were available on the latter. The lack of substantial transmission from observed asymptomatic index cases is notable. However, presymptomatic transmission does occur, with some studies reporting the timing of peak infectiousness at approximately the period of symptom onset</em> </p>

<p>Explain to me how it's fair or ethical to conduct an experimental prophylactic intervention with non-zero risks on a population with zero risks from contracting that disease. With a flawed assumption as the core argument. In the name of "saving their elders". Without their informed consent of course.</p>

        <p>The studies you linked, and even some of those quotations, do acknowledge the existence of asymptomatic transmission, they just point out that the extent of it is likely far weaker. Furthermore, meta-analysis of studies on the matter have found that the asymptomatic transmission rate is around 17%. This is a far cry from having "no evidence" that asymptomatic transmission exists, as you claim, but none of the studies do (at best, some claim it is unclear). </p>
<p><a href="https://jammi.utpjournals.press/doi/10.3138/jammi-2020-0030">https://jammi.utpjournals.press/doi/10.3138/jammi-2020-0030</a></p>
<p>The point here isn't that the lives saved by vaccinating children will make up a substantial percentage of total lives saved by vaccination, but the OP is saying it's dubious that people arguing for this position have any interest in saving lives, when in actuality, his/her point discounts the "barley 2000" children that have already died. Let me make my position clear, I'm interested in saving the lives of any future children (who would have otherwise become part of that 'barley 2000') and at risk groups who cannot receive a vaccine due to medical conditions through the vaccination of children. I understand your issues with that position, some of them are reasonable (informed consent, science still in progress) and some of them are not ("population with zero risks from contracting the disease" ). I'm not sure how you equate children making up 21% of new COVID cases, 2% of total hospitalizations and .06% of deaths as a "zero risk." </p>
<p><a href="https://www.aappublications.org/news/2021/04/19/pediatric-covid-cases-041921">https://www.aappublications.org/news/2021/04/19/pediatric-covid-cases-041921</a></p>
<p>So to sum it up, the assumption is far from flawed, the risk to children is statistically far from a "zero risk," and you answered my appeal for an explanation of the position with your own counter-appeal for an explanation. I've explained my position fully as you requested and in good faith, so if you want to continue this discussion I'd appreciate an explanation of how it’s fair to compare a completely domestic policy goal to one that would require immense amounts of international cooperation as the OP did.</p>

        <p>From your link:</p>
<p>&rt;About 0.01% of children diagnosed with COVID-19 have died</p>
<p>Yeah, zero risk from contracting the disease is hyperbolic. But the risk of actual serious disease is basically anecdotal. The vaccine, in the absence of definitive data, isn't a reasonable risk.     </p>
<p>&rt; Furthermore, meta-analysis of studies on the matter have found that the asymptomatic transmission rate is around 17%.</p>
<p>Ummm that's not what it says: </p>
<p><em>Meta-analysis (fixed effects) found that the proportion of asymptomatic cases was 17%</em></p>
<p>That's <strong>prevalence</strong>, not <strong>transmission</strong> or evidence of it.      </p>
<p>Even if asymptomatic spread were to exist, it'd be such a tiny % in the total, that it'd be impractical to tackle it. Just focusing on symptomatic spread would reduce the R to nearly 0.         </p>
<p>Focusing on the asymptomatic is, objectively, an extremely inefficient and wasteful policy: if you supress (let's say) 5% of the potential transmission, there's still 95% out there. </p>
<p>That's being compounded by the noticeably <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32596514/">low transmission rates from children.</a></p>
<p><em>Studies analysing school transmission showed children as not a driver of transmission. Prevalence of COVID-19 IgG antibody in children &lt;15 years was lower than the general population in the Spanish study.</em></p>
<p>Do you know about diminishin returns? The Pareto principle? That's happening with all the measures and specially with vaccinating non-vulnerable cohorts.     </p>
<p>&rt;I'd appreciate an explanation of how it’s fair to compare a completely domestic policy goal to one that would require immense amounts of international cooperation as the OP did.</p>
<p>Well, as I expressed, it's about ROI. One investment is going to yield negligible results, with potentially bigger drawbacks.     </p>
<p>Not only that, but giving out 100 million doses to age groups that objectively don't need it means you're taking them away from at-risk populations from other countries: yet again, inefficient use of resources.     </p>
<p>On the other hand, the access to potable water would guarantee substantially decreased mortality and disease rates. That's been properly studied over decades. </p>
<p>And if you point out at the international cooperation, the vax passport is requiring that, pretty much pointlessly, and I guarantee you (you can quote me on this) that it'll be obsolete by 2023. Again, wasting resources that could be use on who really need it.</p>

        <p>It is what it says.</p>
<p>"Our <strong>one-in-six</strong> estimate of the <strong>prevalence</strong> of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases <strong>and</strong> asymptomatic <strong>transmission rates</strong> is lower than those of many highly publicized studies but still sufficient to warrant policy attention." </p>
<p>I agree that focusing on asymptomatic spreading as a priority is wasteful and idiotic, but I'm not advocating for that focus. In fact, as you pointed out, children can also be both pre-symptomatic and symptomatic. I'm only arguing that once the most at risk groups have been vaccinated, inoculation strategy should then focus on achieving total herd immunity.</p>
<p>Also, if 2% of total COVID cases are children that have been hospitalized, that hardly seems to be basically anecdotal, as it is a substantial number of children (tens of thousands), even if the percentage is relatively low.</p>
<p>I agree with you, if we prioritized asymptomatic groups here over at-risk groups in other countries that would be a disaster. To my understanding, this is a policy proposition that nobody has actually made. In contrast, a lot has been made recently of the fact that the US is planning on donating a substantial amount of its vaccine supply to developing countries in the near future.</p>
<p>OP's post referenced "the government," I'm asking you to explain how the position that the government could fix the global water shortage because it can ostensibly vaccinate children domestically is logically tenable. Are you of the belief that "the government" could single handedly fix global access to water? Additionally, vaccine passports are not a government proposal here, but rather one emphasized by private businesses.</p>

        <p>&rt; it has very little to do with preventing children from dying, and it <br>
has almost everything to do with protecting at-risk groups who are <br>
unable to get vaccinated due to medical conditions</p>
<p>You don't seem too concerned with this particular group of people having their rights taken away and being treated like second class citizens. Honestly if I was one of them, I'd rather be allowed to live a normal life where I'm allowed to go to the hairdresser or book a plane ticket without having to pay for testing every time, than stay at home and demand little kids get vaccinated so I could feel safe. As far as I know there's no 'exemption passes' for people who can't get the vax, so they have to endure abuse from paranoid covidians and pay for tests every time they want to do something.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;So in that regard, it is about saving lives, both those of at risk <br>
groups that are medically unable to be vaccinated, and of an albeit <br>
nominal amount of children.</p>
<p>Kids play little to almost no role in transmission. At least 95% of the cases in children are asymptomatic. And perhaps we should consider their health and well being first, before the health and well being of an 85 years old nursing home patient with dementia. Nobody knows the long term effects of this vaccine on kids, so lets not turn them into lab rats to protect a few octogenarians, please?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;This makes it silly and unhelpful to compare a domestic vaccination <br>
drive to our initiatives to fix the global water crisis on a policy <br>
level.</p>
<p>Fine, what about <a href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/over-13-million-children-did-not-receive-any-vaccines-all-even-covid-19-disrupted">this</a> then? Let's not immunize kids against disease that can actually kill and maim them but instead inject them with a brand new vaccine that they don't fucking need, because they might accidentally kill an octogenarian in Mississippi or something.</p>
<p>People are starving and dying because of lockdown related disruptions. This is a man made crisis. When threats 10 times as deadly as covid are ignored for the sake of something that killed 3,5mil people around the world in the span of 18 months, you should know that something isn't right. They're letting people with cancer die without treatment ffs, and the field hospitals were barely used... This has nothing to do with saving lives anymore. If you can save one grandma from covid by ruining the lives of 5 other people, pushing them into poverty and misery, depriving them of education and healthcare, would you do it?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;So if anybody can explain to me how vaccinating children wouldn’t save <br>
the lives of those medically unable to get the vaccine and/or explain to<br>
 me how it’s fair to compare a completely domestic policy goal to one <br>
that would require immense amounts of international cooperation then I <br>
would very much appreciate it.</p>
<p>I thought this whole thing was about cooperation on an international level.</p>

        <p>I suck with the quote feature so forgive me but I'm going to address your points in messy order, one point per time you quoted me.</p>
<ol>
<li>I'm not advocating for anyone being treated as a second-class citizen, I'm advocating for a public health solution that would make it far less likely for them to become severely hurt or die. Society will return to normal soon, as we remove precautions we should make efforts to insulate vulnerable groups from harm. So basically, I'm most concerned with this group of people being able to enjoy their right to a happy and healthy life.</li>
<li>Playing a little role in transmission is still playing a role, just like "barley 2000" kids dead is still 2000 kids dead. I agree we should study the vaccines more before vaccinating children, but OP's claim is that people with my position don't care about saving lives, which is clearly false.</li>
<li>The comparison you've made is more valid, but still fails under OP's dichotomy where he talks about "the government," referencing the US. The problem you've pointed to, the disruption in the inoculation of other diseases among children in developing countries, is again, one that US neither caused alone nor could fix alone, these are global issues that are out of the complete control of "the government" to solve. I don't know who "they" is to you, the US government isn't responsible for the issue you've pointed out and could not possibly solve it in a void. </li>
<li>The COVID-19 Pandemic is an international problem that requires cooperation on an international level, I agree. The manner in which a country chooses to inoculate it's citizens has nothing to do with international cooperation and nobody claims it does, with the exception of procuring a vaccine supply, it is almost entirely a domestic goal that requires domestic cooperation, not international cooperation. Does the US need international cooperation to vaccinate its own citizens? No it doesn't, nearly 50% of people already have their first dose. Does the US require international cooperation to fix a global water shortage or a global interruption to children's inoculations? Yes, of course it does.</li>

        <p>&rt; an unvaccinated child could easily asymptomatically spread COVID to one of these people, who would then be at immediate risk of serious illness or death. </p>
<p>But the "one of these people" that the kid maybe somehow possibly ends up passing the virus to would have been vaccinated against covid because they are vulnerable, right?</p>

        <p>I just wanted to get banned but also I think I’m scared. Here’s the reason. Back in the early 90s, for example, if you thought Tom Hanks was kidnapping children and sucking the adrenal fluid out of them and drinking it to stay young, and you went out in your community and started talking about that, almost everybody would say, “What the fuck are you talking about? Get away from me you weirdo.”  And you would probably then think to yourself, “Hmm, maybe I’m off base here.”  But today, you post this online and you find people around the world who say, “That’s only the half of it. Tom Hanks is also raping and eating the children as part of a satanic ritual.”  Now you have validation for your craziness.  All these people feel the same way. It must be true. Now I might say, “Well, crazy is gonna crazy. It doesn’t affect me.”  But then this type of thing spreads until you have thousands of lunatics physically getting together over nonsense and breaking into the Capitol and beating police officers to death. And there’s no truth anymore. And having a society where this happens, long after Covid is in the history books, it just probably isn’t going to end well. So you’re on here trying to scare people out of getting vaccines because all of the world’s medical and scientific community are in on a vast conspiracy to kill us all and all the proof you need is YouTube told me. It makes me think that having no truth will eventually kill us all and I feel like lashing out at you people. Now ban me so I can move on.</p>

        <p>No the point is that wasn’t a typo. It was a fundamental unfamiliarity with the word which is what someone who doesn’t read would do. And that is the point. Stupid people who think they’re smart sharing misinformation with other stupid people will be the downfall of us all.</p>

        <p>Wrong again. You only consider anything worthwhile if it follows the nutty conspiracies you like. If I post some video of a “doctor” in Nigeria saying he has seen Covid vaccines turn children into gay, pot smoking communists overnight, you’ll be all over it.  How do I get banned from here anyhow?  This is annoying.</p>

        <p>You can just move on, we aren't the type to ban people just because they disagree. We are uncomfortable too, which is why we are here. For the most part, besides occasional memes and people posting things without digging a little first, we are here to find and share information. We try to dig and cross reference everything we can. There are so many reasons why we are skeptical, and it is scary for us to see so many people blindly follow along either side without seeking information, checking sources and using critical thinking. I'm not going to go into the other stuff you mention, that's a little too far out for me. And it isn't just right leaning trumpers or whatever that are here. Trump is in full support of the vaccine, even trying to take full credit for their availability. So that argument doesn't really work. In my social circle, it's made up of about half of each political side, but we get along just fine because we are friends and care about each other far beyond political ideals. None of them are willing to take the vaccine right now. Nobody is antivax, just see enough negative risk to wait it out, which is really a responsible choice. If you want it, get it, that is your choice, and I hope it is informed and researched personally.</p>

        <p>Ok, maybe you're right. We're all trumptard anti-vaxxers who really don't care about these African children.</p>
<p>But...</p>
<p>Do you honestly think all the billionaires, politicians and pharma companies care? They're losing sleep over 2000 or so child deaths worldwide and they want to vaccinate them against something that is completely HARMLESS to them, because they care about saving lives? Like really? They could have solved the problem I mentioned on the post above years ago, but they didn't.</p>
<p>And now they care.</p>
<p>About 2000 kids.</p>
<p>But they were fine with all the deaths caused by literally anything else middle class western kids don't die of.</p>

        <p>But.. it is not harmless to them?? With the exception of a few top-level companies, the economy isn't exactly rising during the pandemic in most countries and therefore it is also in their best interest to get this situation out of the way. Obviously they wouldn't care about our personal health during the pandemic, but this literally doesn't mean that any act done by the leaders is done specifically to screw us over, to force us into a "new normal" - instead they might just want to use vaccines specifically to get rid of this pandemic as quickly as possible due to economic reasons. This also still explains why nothing is done for african water quality on the other hand.. they just don't have to care, it doesn't affect their economy. These issues aren't as two sided as "they either care for us personally or they work against us at all times"</p>

        <p>There is overwhelming and undeniable scientific proof the vaccine prevents someone from contracting a disease that has killed 580,000+ Americans. I don’t care that many of them are elderly. Their lives still have meaning. Whatever bullshit you think you know because of your YouTube watching is garbage. What you spew is a bunch of internet nonsense and is dangerous misinformation. I can live perfectly fine in my nice house with my wife and children because I’m right. I take back what I said before. I am virtuous. Stupid people trying to do stupid things should be mocked.</p>

        <p>the dangerous misinformation is that you assume someone who does not agree with government actions regarding COVID has their information from youtube, twitter, facebook or other social media. all of which fervently block anti-covid-politics content btw.</p>
<p>so you think its perfectly ok that arround 100 million people more will suffer from hunger this year due to lockdown measures in western countries? many will die by the way. more than 3.5m.</p>
<p>just admit that you don't really care about people and only care about yourself and your nation.  </p>
<p>you are not dangerously misinformed, just ignorant.</p>

        <p>Oh fuck off dude. Now you’re changing the whole conversation here because you have no credible leg to stand on with anti-vaccine bullshit. This was about vaccines and what aboutism. Why are you trying to get kids vaccinated when there’s starving kids in the world?  That’s what this was about. I’m not some Republican shit head. You want to have a conversation about the problems of capitalism and what can be done to fix them or abolishing the whole thing all together then let’s do that. Maybe you are some altruistic individual who just wants to save the world, I don’t know. This is just some internet babbling by the both of us, but in my real life experience the people who are shouting about vaccines and lockdowns the most are selfish, moronic, assholes, who say grandma lived long enough, I need to go to the gym. Vaccines are the key to not having lockdowns. You are fighting against yourself here.</p>
