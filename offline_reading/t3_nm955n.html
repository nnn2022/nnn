        <p>This article is disturbing on so many levels. It is a perfect example of why everything is so upside down right now. You have a person writing in about a husband, a man, who acts like an absolute child about getting sick. Wearing a mask every moment of the day. Sleeping with it on. Wearing a mask during sex with his wife. Wearing it in the shower. Clearly, he is scared. Men like my grandfather, my dad, they didn't get scared. If they did, they never showed it. Shit, my grandfather used to strap himself into a ball turret, that hung underneath an airplane, and tried to shoot down little airplanes that were shooting back at him and the plane he was protecting. Those guys weren't allowed to be scared. Everyone is full of fear these days and it's helping keep things upside down. </p>
<p>The other issue here is, the person responding to whoever wrote the original question. The person tells the woman to give her husband 3 options. But, they aren't options. They are ultimatums. Go see a doctor. Do what he says. Go see a shrink for a certain amount of sessions. If he doesn't do any of those things, threaten to end the marriage. Those are directives, not options. </p>
<p>Everything is done to the extreme nowadays. Actions taken and reactions to those actions are no longer reasonable. People are no longer reasonable. And its generational. I think my generation might just be the last one that understands what being reasonable is. The media, the people in office, anyone who is able to influence others on a vast scale, fuel the behavior of being unreasonable.  It has turned everyday living into an out of control circus.</p>
