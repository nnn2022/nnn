    <strong>Has anyone of you heard of RS Virus?</strong>
    <p><p>The Dutch msm have been posting articles about a new virus called RS virus</p>
<p>Source : https://www.nu.nl/binnenland/6147239/vaccinatie-tegen-rs-virus-laat-waarschijnlijk-nog-jaren-op-zich-wachten.html</p>
<p>English Translation :</p>
<p>It is very unlikely that a vaccine against the RS virus will be found within a year, a RIVM spokesperson told NU.nl. The studies on the potential vaccines against this common cold virus may continue for years, after which they have yet to be approved by the European Medicines Agency (EEA). A working vaccine can therefore take three to five years anyway, according to the institute.</p>
<p>At the moment there are many reports about the RS virus coming into the Netherlands. In fact, there are so many of them that there is an epidemic. Although this is unusual for the time of year, there is an explanation for this: due to the measures against the coronavirus, the RS virus could not spread last winter. Because these measures have been partially released, the virus can now spread again.</p>
<p>The RS virus is an innocuous cold virus in the vast majority of people. Mortality due to the RS virus is rare in the Netherlands. But young babies in particular can very occasionally end up in hospital and even end up in intensive care with severe pneumonia.</p>
<p>A vaccine against the RS virus has been underway for decades. One of the main causes that it takes so long is that we do not yet fully know how the protection against the RS virus actually works. This is important to make a working and above all safe vaccine. Researchers suspect that in very rare cases, the RS virus can lead to more serious disease if a possible vaccine does not provoke the right reaction in the body. New vaccines are being extensively investigated for this.</p>
<p>Several of the studies on RS vaccines are currently in the research phase, testing the vaccine on a large group. If no special side effects occur, the vaccine can be used. But whether the vaccines get through this research phase remains to be seen. A RIVM spokesman said it was "unfortunately not unusual" for potential vaccines to die in this third phase of research</p>
<p>Examination of administration in pregnant women or babies The vaccines that are currently at an advanced stage can be divided into two different types. The first species is aimed at the children themselves. Certainly one of these types of vaccines is now well advanced. The second species is given to pregnant women. By vaccinating pregnant women against the RS virus, the child receives antibodies through the placenta. In this way, the children are protected in their first months of life - the period when the risk of the virus is greatest. Two such vaccines are now advanced</p>
<p>At the moment, only the most vulnerable babies are given a preventive remedy for the RS virus. This medicine reduces the chance of an infection being serious. An important reason that the drug is little used is that it has to be injected every month and that the cost is relatively high.</p></p>

        <p>Feels like we're never getting out of it anymore.</p>
<p>Even if covid becomes unbelievable they have something else ready to make people mask up, lockdown, vaccinate it worries me.</p>

        <p>My sense is that whoever is orchestrating this is testing how far they can push it.  It's our collective responsibility to send an unambiguous message, "enough".</p>

        <p>RSV? It's not new, it's doing the rounds through New Zealand and Australia at the moment (winter here). Alot kids I know have had it in the last several weeks. </p>
<p>No big deal normally, but for kids who have been locked inside for a year without any immune system priming; reports suggest out of NZ at least, it is presenting more severe.</p>

        <p>RSV has seen a massive uptick in the USA too. Can be very dangerous (and fatal) to the very young, not so much as you age (think: the exact opposite of C19).</p>
<p>You can see this in the weekly "influenza like illness" report. The only real "case surge"right now is in the 0-4 year old range,  and it's driven almost exclusively by RSV.</p>
