        <p>&rt; Virology: the problem with ‘leaky’ vaccines
Fresh evidence supports the theory that some vaccines lead to the evolution of more virulent viral strains
A chicken poultry
Marek’s disease has become increasingly virulent in domesticated poultry flocks over the past 50 years</p>
<p>&rt; August 7, 2015 3:28 pm by Clive Cookson</p>
<p>&rt; Extensive experiments with chickens have produced evidence to support the controversial theory that some vaccines lead to the evolution of more virulent viral strains. The study, carried out at the Pirbright Institute site in Berkshire, found that vaccinating poultry against Marek’s disease, which is caused by a herpes virus, made the infection increasingly lethal as time passed.</p>
<p>&rt; The researchers say the findings, published in the journal PLOS Biology, should not be misrepresented to provide ammunition for anti-vaccine campaigners. Andrew Read, a biology professor at Penn State University who took part in the study, says current vaccines for human diseases such as polio, mumps, rubella and measles “are the least expensive, most effective public health interventions we have ever had”.</p>
<p>&rt; The scientists make a distinction between these “perfect vaccines”, which stop the individual becoming ill and at the same time prevent the infection being transmitted to others, and “leaky vaccines”, such as the one against Marek’s disease in chickens, which prevent illness but not viral transmission.</p>
<p>&rt; But they express caution about some new human vaccines under development that might have evolutionary consequences, as the Marek’s vaccine does in poultry. “The challenge for the future is to identify other vaccines that also might allow more virulent versions of a virus to survive and possibly to become even more harmful,” says Read.</p>
<p>&rt; Ecological theory suggests that extremely virulent pathogens tend to evolve in nature to become less lethal, so that they do not kill all their potential hosts before they have time to spread. A leaky vaccine removes this pressure to become less virulent: as the pathogen passes between vaccinated hosts, it can gain virulence without killing them — with severe consequences for any unvaccinated individuals it encounters.</p>
<p>&rt; “In our tests of the leaky Marek’s disease virus in groups of vaccinated and unvaccinated chickens, the unvaccinated died while those that were vaccinated survived and transmitted the virus to other birds left in contact with them,” says Venugopal Nair, who led the Pirbright research team. “Our research demonstrates that the use of leaky vaccines can promote the evolution of nastier ‘hot’ viral strains that put unvaccinated individuals at greater risk.”</p>
<p>&rt; We do not want the evolution of viral diseases as deadly as Ebola</p>
<p>&rt; Marek’s disease has become increasingly virulent in domesticated poultry flocks over the past 50 years and today it kills almost all unvaccinated birds, sometimes within 10 days. The researchers do not have historical data to prove that vaccination has driven the increased lethality, though their study suggests that it played a role.</p>
<p>&rt; “Even though the Marek’s disease virus is much nastier now than it was in the 1950s, it is becoming increasingly rare and now it causes relatively minor problems in the poultry industry because almost every chicken in agricultural production worldwide is vaccinated against the disease,” Read says. “If you can vaccinate all the individuals in a population against a virus, it does not matter if the virus has become super-virulent as long as the vaccine continues to be effective.”</p>
<p>&rt; Read’s concern for the future rests on “next generation vaccines” against diseases such as Ebola, HIV, malaria and bird flu, which do not generate strong natural immunity. “If the next generation vaccines are ‘leaky’, they could drive the evolution of more virulent strains of the virus,” he says. “We do not want the evolution of viral diseases as deadly as Ebola evolving in the direction that our research has demonstrated is possible with less-than-perfect, leaky vaccines.”</p>
<p>&rt; Independent experts urge caution in extrapolating the findings of the Pirbright study. “It is important not to claim from this example in chickens that this is a problem with vaccines in humans,” says Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute, a vaccine research centre in Oxford. “There is strong evidence that widely used human vaccines are not producing any such effect.”</p>
<p>&rt; Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, agrees: “The standard vaccines that are in current use are safe and effective, and not prone to cause the emergence of more dangerous strains of viruses.”</p>

        <p>To me, this means you should only get the vaccine if you need to (I. E. Underlying health issues). As the more people get vaccinated, the more chance we have of creating deadlier strains.</p>
<p>Or is it already too late? And this is why governments are putting more pressure on everyone to get vaccinated as we need to either completely stop covid now (before more strains evolve) or because they know the virus will begin to become deadlier to the unvaccinated and they're actually trying to protect them/us, without being able to explain this truth. </p>
<p>This also gives a theory on why Australia is aiming for 0 covid cases. As very few of their population have antibodies through contracting covid or having the vaccine, therefore they may be even more vulnerable to these new strains.</p>

        <p>So I’m interested in this as well since I’m unvaccinated, it may be too late if this particular theory or scenario proves to be true. I think we would know though especially in UK and Israel where majority of the population is vaccinated. It doesn’t seem like the virus is operating differently (for example it doesn’t seem to be killing younger people).</p>

        <p>That's a good point. This post is just a theory of what could happen. So yeah, guess we should just keeo track of the virus or new variants to see if it starts to kill healthy unvaccinated people. Hopefully this theory is wrong and it doesn't 🤞</p>

        <p>Exactly, this has been giving me serious anxiety recently.
I thought it's not worth risking the vax's side affects and let my (young and healthy) immune system deal with the virus. But now it seems like we're fucked either way.
We get the blame for doing the right thing and pay for it as a consequence.</p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing this.</p>
<p>Here’s an extract that I find interesting;
&rt; By preventing death, vaccination greatly increased the infectious period of the most virulent strains, increasing the total amount of virus shed by several orders of magnitude, and increasing it above that of the least virulent strain (Fig 1, bottom panels). Thus, the net effect of vaccination on both host survival rates and daily shedding rates was to vastly increase the amount of virus shed by virulent strains into the environment.</p>
<p>In English, does this mean that deadly variants that would normally not spread (as it would normally kill the unvaccinated host) will survive in vaccinated hosts and be allowed to spread thanks to the vaccine, increasing the chance of killing those unvaccinated?</p>
<p>My take is to watch out in the news for if/when healthy young people start dieing from COVID, if that starts happening I’m moving the Greenland</p>

        <p>It's all bollocks.
Next time I hear that, I'm going to quote this;</p>
<p>&rt; Ecological theory suggests that extremely virulent pathogens tend to evolve in nature to become less lethal, so that they do not kill all their potential hosts before they have time to spread. A leaky vaccine removes this pressure to become less virulent: as the pathogen passes between vaccinated hosts, it can gain virulence without killing them — with severe consequences for any unvaccinated individuals it encounters.</p>
<p>Viruses always mutate to make variants. In unvaxxed, the variants become less lethal. In vaxxed, the variants become more lethal</p>
