    <strong>Lockdowns have ruined everything</strong>
    <p><p>I just started a new job remotely and can’t completely figure out the culture and communication preferences/methods this way. I can’t read people’s facial expressions, which is important to me to gauge into how people feel about things. I also feel people use WFH as an excuse (?) to avoid timely communications and face-to-face or even phone call interactions, which IMO is critical for a new hire to learn. Also, there is no good way for anyone to onboard, train, and learn starting off remotely. I get people are burnt out after a year of this, but this is kinda ridiculous for me and I wish time could be taken by my superiors to go into office and teach me stuff/meet me F2F. </p>
<p>In addition, my company doesn’t mandate the covid vaccine, but what if any of my team members want me to take it to feel comfortable? Will I have to just stay working remotely then? This is all a mess. If lockdowns hadn’t happen, I would have stayed with my previous job, at the office, and wouldn’t have gotten laid off, only to be back to square with this. Sure, my new job is more prestigious and pays better, but it’s not worth all this mess. #rantover</p></p>

        <p>The lock down isn't the problem, sounds more like an issue with your company and their processes not properly adapting.</p>

        <p>Not only this, but my relationship with my one and only has been affected by the lockdown effects too. We’re on 2 different horizons and in different places now dealing with the effects of all this, on our lives, emotions, and jobs, and it’s all out of our control and horrible. I’m really upset with everything, I can’t deal anymore.</p>

        <p>I’m in the same boat as you. I started a new job just as the lockdowns began 11 months ago and have been at home the whole time. WFH does have its benefits, but at this point I’d much rather be in the office with some human interaction. </p>
<p>What appalls me the most are the individuals who can work comfortably from home and say “I wish we could stay in lockdown forever!”. They don’t care about the millions who have been out of work. It’s all about whatever makes <em>them</em> feel good.</p>

        <p>I’m glad I’m not alone in feeling this way. I agree that WFH has its benefits, but imo communication and interaction is just so much easier in person. We really took that for granted before lockdowns. </p>
<p>I completely agree! They have no sympathy whatsoever, just because they are comfortable at home, they want this arrangement to continue. Without realising the extreme detrimental effects on others. It’s truly sad and reprehensible. </p>
<p>Is your job remote just because of covid, or is it permanently remote?</p>

        <p>In normal times were in the office but allowed one day to work from home. At first they said we were going back in June... then August... Now it seems like it will be like this indefinitely. It’s weird because I don’t personally know my boss or any of my colleagues, and the only time anyone wants to interact is if they need something from me. I’ve never had many friends except for ones in the workplace, so this has definitely been hard. We don’t even use video calling (just audio)! So you can imagine how strange it is...</p>
<p>Not only that, but I live in a tiny apartment with my S/O where we had to make arrangements for both of us to work. Had we known the work situation would be like this, we would’ve gone with a much bigger place.</p>

        <p>To be fair, they are only saying they want the lockdown forever because they know that companies are stupid and will want to force everyone back into offices even when there are cost savings and it is proven that a lot of people don't actually need to be in an office to do their work and do their work effectively.</p>
<p>They aren't talking about the world in general being in lockdown forever.</p>

<p>If that's the case, explain to them that the vaccine doesn't work if it can't protect vaccinated subjects. It's useless.</p>
