    <strong>This is a new virus but only when it's convenient</strong>
    <p><p>Whenever anyone asks questions the "health experts" don't want to answer, they simply say something like "this is a new virus we are still learning about it" but when someone questions the vaccine the answer is "we've known about this virus for years, this isn't a rushed vaccine" that's just what i've noticed correct me if i'm wrong but that seems to be commonly be the case.</p></p>

        <p>I can't say whether or not this vaccine is dangerous, for me it's too early to tell. I think the idea that you're confusing though is the fact that they have been exploring the idea of mRNA vaccines for years. They have been testing them on animals since the 90s. Not that they've "known about this virus for years." When this virus was discovered, scientists immediately went to work developing an mRNA vaccine for it.</p>
<p>"Correct me if I'm wrong" does not exactly fly around here, but anyway. Do what you like with these facts, as you will.</p>

        <p>That link actually explains it much better than I could.</p>
<p>&rt; Researchers were not starting from scratch when they learned about SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.</p>
<p>&rt;SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the coronavirus family. According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, there are hundreds of coronaviruses â€” including four that can cause the common cold, as well as the coronaviruses that sparked the SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, epidemic in 2002 and the emergence of MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome, in 2012.</p>
<p>Covid is not the first coronavirus. Just a new type of coronavirus. Think of it like we know about mammals, but they just discovered a new kind of mouse.</p>
