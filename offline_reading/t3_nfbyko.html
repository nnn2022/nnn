    <strong>Mask Mandates lifted at work spells disaster for many of us</strong>
    <p><p>Just heard that mask mandate will he lifted at my office tomorrow but only for vaccinated individuals. Do we really think we can just go about our days before the sheep start complaining about it not being a safe space, and eventually being labeled an anti-vax nazi? This is bad folks</p></p>

        <p>Your employer cannot legally ask for proof of vaccination. Nor should they bend the knee to those who are afraid of the common flu and are just brainwashed. You need to fight it, if that happens. No amount of complaining or warning others of this “doom” will do anything useful. Fight.</p>

        <p>I can tell you what they will do: they will assume since you aren't giving proof you are unvaccinated and you need a mask. Much more likely for an antivaxer to not voluntarily disclose that info than someone who got vaccinated</p>

        <p>Unless specific vaccination is a condition of employment.  That might be a challenge to enforce for existing employees, but I've not read much on HR law.</p>

        <p>In order for an employer to require vaccination, the unvaccinated have to pose a threat to their coworkers and the public. Given the number of businesses that have remained open throughout this situation, that's a tough argument to make when a business like mine has had employees test positive throughout the year without a single instance of community spread in the office. </p>
<p>Provided the employer can substantiate their argument  that unvaccinated people are a direct threat, they must comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act for staff who cannot be vaccinated for a medical reason and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for staff with sincerely held religious beliefs that prohibit vaccination. Accommodations made cannot apply undue hardships on the employees and cannot be done in a discriminatory manner. The reason for the accommodation must remain confidential. </p>
<p>If the employer satisfies all of these requirements their mandate makes them liable for adverse effects suffered by the staff as workplace injuries. Why an employer would assume this risk for an emergency authorized vaccine designed to address a virus with an IFR of only 0.15% when it won't have full FDA approval until at least 2022 or 2023 is beyond my comprehension. Wouldn't surprise me if Workers Comp policies specifically exclude coverage for this vaccine in 2022 leaving these employers totally responsible for all damages without any recourse to the manufacturers who are completely immune from claims.</p>

        <p>The irony is that it won't be much longer before it slams into the public consciousness that those who have taken the injections are transmitting the spike protein or some other infectious mechanism.  The injected will be the super spreaders, just as the blood supply is already compromised as blood banks are accepting donations from those who have been injected.</p>
<p>The worst is yet to come.</p>

        <p>This really does not seem legal and will probably go away soon enough. My work asks employees to send their proof of vax to HR, but we all still wear masks. That way no one's medical choice is worn on their face. I'm sure my work will try it too. I make good money and love this place, so I will hang in there until I can't anymore. A forced vax would be my dealbreaker and I won't leave without a fight. I will lawyer up.</p>

        <p>Yeah we don't know yet but I hope push doesn't come to shove there. I think in most cases especially with lower end job they can't just kick you our for being anti-vax BUT they can use loopholes like this to humiliate you and try to get us to leave. Though there has to be something here that's illegal about it all but then again I'm also not a law expert and from what I seen it's quite a complex field of knowledge. But whether or not is the point still stands that this is just WRONG</p>

        <p>Publix is doing the same thing. Same with Walmart. Now everyone can tell who the unvaccinated employees are, because they’re the only ones still wearing masks. Even the store manager still has to wear a mask because, it’s a order from corporate.</p>
