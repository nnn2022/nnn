    <strong>I have covid antibodies but I’m still deemed an ~anti-vaxxer~</strong>
    <p><p>I had covid in October 2020. All the normal symptoms—lost sense of taste and smell for about a week, dry cough, sinus pressure, fever, fatigue. I was tested and received a negative PCR. I treated it as a false negative. My best friend got an antibody test about 2 months later, since she had similar symptoms and had been in close contact with me in October, and she had antibodies. I never got around to doing the antibody test but assumed since she had them, I probably did too or at least T cell memory.</p>
<p>I just entered a clinical study which is tracking everyone’s antibodies—from prior infection, suspected prior infection, unvaccinated, and vaccinated. Of course I never received the vaccine. Yesterday, in July, almost 10 months later … I have antibodies. Guess what my test results say? “Indicative of recent or prior covid-19 infection or covid-19 vaccination”</p>
<p>Well …. I’m not vaccinated, but according to this serological test, they’d never know I wasn’t. Not to mention, a friend got the vaccine in February and didn’t show any antibodies come April. Yet another example of the BS that I thought I’d share.</p></p>

        <p>Absofuckinglutely. You are better protected than those who are vaccinated. Your immune system is properly prepped. T-cell memory will keep you immune for years too. Keep some documentation of your antibody tests.</p>

        <p>It’s so messed up because they literally make T cell mediated response tests; but nobody can get their hands on them. Bet so many people have T cell memory—maybeee even from the last SARS outbreak in 2002-2004. My dad (he is in his 70s, but very fit and healthy) did not get covid when I had it in October … I was living with him, even though I was being pretty careful, I was still surprised. He claims he did have the first SARS bad in the early 2000s, so I have to guess maybe he had some T cell memory?</p>

        <p>Mike Yeadon (ex-Pfizer) said that those who contracted the original SARS were found to have an immunity from SARS-Cov-2 as well (they also still had immunity from the original SARS-Cov even after 18 years).</p>

        <p>You don't need to be vaccinated against a disease you already had and survived.  Don't let anybody pressure you into taking it if you don't want to.  I know lots of people who took it anyway, and they were pretty much fine, but I see it as a largely unnecessary risk.</p>

        <p>Me too. Got briefly ill, minor symptoms, stayed home, recovered. I’m young and have a healthy and strong immune system. My doc told me and my wife that the shots are unnecessary unless we want them. Or maybe I should listen to the hysteria in the media.</p>

        <p>I’m not antivax, I read all sides, I’m open minded.  This is the most puzzling thing ever and should really make everyone question everything related to covid. Having antibodies related to natural immunity after contracting and getting over covid is not sufficient and a vaccine is STILL needed?  I don’t care who you are or your beliefs but if that doesn’t make you scratch your head and at least ask “why”, your picture may be in the dictionary next to the word gullible. Once again, not antivax - my wife is vaxxed and fine. I’m hesitant</p>

        <p>Does anyone know the best way for a person to test for antibodies?  For example, can you make an appointment at Quest diagnostics or anything like that?    And if so, are those tests accurate enough to detect them such as what was done in the OP's study to detect antibodies 10 months after?  Because I've heard some of these tests won't detect antibodies after so many months.</p>

        <p>hi! I honestly think the best route would be to ask your PCP to put in an order for “SARS-COV-2 Total Antibody, Spike (RBD), Qualitative” For labs you need someone to order them and they might send you to Quest. I’ve had a chiropractor order me random labs when no one else would … so if it comes to that, they have some ordering power too. It appears that if you have a good amount of antibodies, it will detect. Mine wasn’t a quantitative test so I don’t know what the measurement would be. I actually would bet that if you could get a PCP through a university health system to order for you, you might be best off with the most accuracy since they are most likely running studies like this so they’ll have the best resources/diagnostics. I work at a university health system as a research coordinator, so this is all based on my inference from that.</p>

        <p>It pretty much just means that I had Covid at one point and I have antibodies they won’t give you any kind of interpretation otherwise because they don’t want everybody thinking “oh I have antibodies I don’t need the vaccine” is pretty much what I am realizing from all the stuff I’ve tried to look up</p>

        <p>It's okay, even good to be an 'anti-vaxer'... Our bodies have an elegant system of filters, cleaning and processing... injecting anything directly into the blood stream is subverting this system, and is thus disrespectful to the body. Love your liver, love your body.</p>

        <p>It has  <em>nothing</em>  to do with reason or the virus, it is about <em>your actions pertaining to the group.</em></p>
<p>It's "are you for or against us?" as they mock, threaten, dismiss, insult or shirk away from you.</p>
<p>I'm not too hopeful that there will be any good-faith discussion beyond that paradigm.  </p>
<p>Because that would (to them, incorrectly) indicate that there are other available discourses.</p>
