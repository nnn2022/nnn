    <strong>Going to the grocery store really sucks now</strong>
    <p><p>Whether I go with a mask or without it’s more negative than it used to be. Without one makes me feel on edge, at the brink with conflict with the masked masses. Overall it’s just unpleasant. When I do wear a mask I want to get out as fast as I can and get the mask off my face. When I don’t wear one I want to get out as fast as I can. It simply has become a dreadful experience, whereas I used to feel more of an accomplishment from going to the store to get what my family needs now it’s just dread. Walking into the store without a mask, it’s like you’ve become Satan himself with the way people act around you. I don’t really have much to say about it, you all probably understand this well enough.</p>
<p>*Forgot to mention, the worst thing is the fear of being kicked from the store, of coming into conflict with the security. Of course there’s also being doxxed where someone films you because you don’t wear a mask. The feeling of being there is negative not simply because of the shoppers who I don’t care much for, but because of wondering how far they will go to enforce their rules. I’m kind of that person who overthinks things so I imagine several potential scenarios of how they’ll attempt to remove me from the store. For example, when I come across an employee who wants me to wear a mask, and I say I don’t want to wear one, and they walk away I think in my head they might be calling the police or getting security. That could be far from what’s happening but I really don’t trust these people to act reasonably after some past interactions, as well as conflicts I’ve seen online. This whole though process causes me anxiety, alongside the anxiety from my family member if I’m there with them.</p></p>

        <p>I have stopped caring what people perceive of me in the grocery store. I am comforted that I am remaining true to myself and not succumbing to the propaganda. Plus I realize how idiotic and sad everybody looks muzzled up. Such dejection in their eyes. I try to smile at people to show that it is okay and we are still human beings.</p>

        <p>It is so disorienting and downright torturous to go out in public now. Even if I feel uncomfortable or pressured to conform, I just smile extra hard and try to stifle my nerves. It does work! Although I am a relatively tall and fit male, so maybe people are slightly more intimidated? Lol</p>

        <p>LOL tell me about it.  People go to the grocery store and are constantly 1 to 3 ft apart.  It's like they think the 'magic mask' is going to protect them.  I ranted about this the other day because I work in one.  The funniest thing to me is the corporation mandates we wear one but it also mandates that we can only eat in the break room.  Now how, exactly, are 5 to 10 people going to gather in a 15 x 15 room and eat and keep their masks on?  LOL... truth is behind the scenes the masks come off people.  Now I'm a pretty clean person and I wash my hands when I go to the bathroom which is about twice a shift other than that just like every other human in the world I'll scratch my nose, wipe my hand over my face, and so on.  Sorry your can of soup gave you COVID and your magic mask didn't protect you from my dirty ass.</p>

        <p>I don't wear one so my anxiety is on high. If I see someone reach for their cell phone I quickly turn out of the aisle to run. I've never experienced shopping for groceries in a state of fear and panic that my picture will be taken and put on social media. This has gone far enough.</p>

        <p>I work in one.  Trust me MOST of the employees at least where I work appreciate people who aren't wearing one.  Every single one of us knows that the mask aint doing shit.  It just gives people a false sense of security.  The only way the mask is going to 'work' is if people practice constant good hygiene (ya right) and social distance (they don't and wont).  I can't count the number of times I've been throwing stock on a shelf and a masked up person is leaning over me.  If they had the COVID their virus particles are falling all over me.  Still haven't caught it.  We figure the sooner the panicked herd finds out that their 'measures' don't protect them the sooner we can take the fucking things off.</p>

        <p>What really depresses me every day is the awkward "Stay out of my safe zone" dance everybody has to do anytime you go in a store. "Left, right, left? Are you gonna go left?". Even sadder is people are teaching their children to live like this. Avoiding human contact is the rule for them. It's not right, we're not supposed to live like this, and it's ruining an entire generation of children.</p>

        <p>Hope you have some chain nearby that lets you order online, drive up to the store, call, and some youngster comes out and loads everything in your vehicle. Can't tell you how sweet that is. I'm never going into a supermarket again as long as this service is available (free for now; still worth it if they later charge for it). Walmart and FredMeyer do it in my area.</p>
<p>Even if you feel like you have to go into the store to inspect a few items yourself (e.g., fruits, veggies), you can get the bulk of your shopping done via online/pickup and cut down your in-store time drastically.</p>

        <p>Doesn't matter. He/she doesn't come near me the entire exchange. Pop the trunk, they load, away I go. </p>
<p>Plus, the delivery takes place outdoors. If you're the type who insists on "sanitizing" each item purchased at a grocery store before touching it, you may have a problem, but most will recognize it as far superior to going into a store and dealing with the unwashed masses.</p>

        <p>I drive to the other side of town to a grocery store with no arrows in the aisles telling me which way to go.  I can grab a rogue shopping cart in the parking lot if I need one, since they seem to have stopped bothering to excessively sanitize them.  The self-serve chicken wing bar has always been open.  The bulk section has always been open.  The self-checkouts are open.  These are all small things that make a huge difference to my anxiety around shopping now.  I still have to wear a mask and be socially distant while waiting for the check-out, but otherwise this is as normal as it gets these days.</p>

        <p>MA here and the local Walmart now has a police officer in uniform and two employees just inside the entrance area. Unsure if this is all the time, I've only been there twice since March, but it's very unnerving combined with barricades to direct flow. I've been shopping online more, smaller local stores, or simply going without because I dread dealing with the security theater. Feels so dystopian and unpleasant.</p>

        <p>I keep a gaiter (sp?) around my neck.  If I'm within 6 ft of someone and I can tell they're uncomfortable I'll pull it up out of common courtesy.  As much as I disagree with the whole mask thing I really don't want to make anyone uncomfortable around me.  That said as soon as I'm away from the covidiot it comes right back down.  My opinion for what it's worth is if you're so afraid of this 'dread disease' stay home, use curbside for groceries, you can also order most non perishable grocery items off of Amazon.  There are options that the covidiots could use so the rest of us could live our lives free.  If you choose to imprison yourself out of fear that's on you.  Don't make your fear my problem.</p>

        <p>I'm not OP, but even if you don't care what people think you can still be affected by their emotions empathically. Picked up by magnetite crystals on your brain, retina, and other methods. I forget exactly, but heart frequencies can be measured something like ~12ft and brain ~30+ft. Can dig more into this and other crystal physics but probably not on this sub.</p>

        <p>If I cared a ton what others thought I wouldn’t be able to go to the store without a mask. It’s the anxiety more about getting in conflict with security, employees, or god forbid police. I want to get my groceries not just for myself but for my family, I’m one of the few who can drive. Plus, since I’m a minor (still 17) I feel I’m skating in thinner ice than you adults out there who have more resources. For example if I had to pay a fine or something it would be every bit of money I have. </p>
<p>If it was simply about pleasing or not pleasing people I wouldn’t care, but I have reason to worry about various forms of potential enforcement that would stop me from getting my groceries. I’ve gone before without a mask and no one has really come into conflict with me, and I think me being black has something to do with it. But recently I come across black employees so since there’s not the racial tension or whatever that stop them from interacting with me I fear getting kicked from the store.</p>

        <p>I actually enjoy going to the grocery store and other places to shop. I just wear a mask to protect myself and others from airborne infectious diseases like covid, it really doesn't bother me at all. It's nice to not worry about getting too close to people or to have to worry about anyone judging you for your mask choice since it's mandatory in my county. It's unfortunate that your political beliefs are negativily effecting your life. It's common sense that masks help prevent the spread of disease, I'd suggest just wearing one in places like grocery stores and stop making your life more difficult and unpleasant than it needs to be.</p>

        <p>Just normal surgical masks, they're really not uncomfortable at all, I think the reason why you guys find them so unbearable may be psychosomatic. I get that wearing it for 8 hours a day for your job could be unpleasant, but a 20 minute shopping trip is really not a big deal.</p>

        <p>Surgical mask or non-medical mask that looks like a surgical mask?</p>
<p>Because even surgical masks only provide some protection against bacterial infections, not viruses.  You need a respirator with a seal and filter if not a positive pressure suit to protect against viruses.  Bacteria are micro scale organisms, viruses are nano scale.</p>

        <p>you're not protecting anyone you know.  'It's nice to not worry about getting too close to people' says it all.  The ONLY way the mask works is a combination of social distancing, mask, and great personal hygiene.  Try going to a grocery store some day and staying at least 6' away from everyone INCLUDING the check out person.  By the way take a look at them some day.  They're constantly touching their face then handling your groceries.  You are so safe now.  LOL.  Do you REALLY think the checkout people go to the bathroom and wash their hands after breaks?  You are deluding yourself.  Your 'magic mask' is not protecting you in any way, shape, or form.  You are asking a bunch of minimum wage people to act like doctors in an operating room to protect your health.  Sorry man.  That aint happening.  MAYBE 1 out of 100 will but they're the exception.</p>
