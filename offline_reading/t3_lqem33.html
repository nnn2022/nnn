        <p>Highlights:</p>
<p>&rt; Wearing surgical masks does not prevent a person from inhaling smaller airborne particles; they are not considered respiratory protection by the CDC. Surgical masks are also loose fitting, and when the wearer inhales, there is potential for particles to leak in or out of the sides.</p>
<p>&rt; People who aren’t sick should not rely on masks as a way of preventing respiratory infections, according to Popescu, who notes that surgical masks offer <strong>“limited protection”</strong> against contracting illness. While face masks can be helpful in stopping the spread of germs in certain situations — like when people are in close quarters on a train or packed into a waiting room — <strong>they are unlikely to stem the outbreak of the new coronavirus.</strong></p>
<p>&rt; To help stop the spread of respiratory infections, it is recommended that people wash their hands often, avoid touching their faces, keep distance from people who are sick and to stay inside if they are sick.</p>
<p>All seems pretty sensible to me. Strange they don't explain why the thinking changed.</p>

        <p>I know, it’s infuriating. The brainwashed drones chant “the science changed” but there is nothing to back that up.  <br>
It just changed, that’s it, end of story.</p>

        <p>Considering "the science" is just made up and pulled out of their ass on the fly they can change it "studies masks show masks block newly discovered covid causing airborne particle never before observed behind the pandemic" and the change would just as equally make sense. And that is what makes it so dangerous, they'll all read it and believe it no matter what it seems judging by what unscientific nonsense they already believe now.</p>
