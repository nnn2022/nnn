    <strong>Gun Violence will be the next "epidemic" in the US</strong>
    <p><p>Unfortunately, it seems that a substantial portion of Americans would love to give up their rights. Next up on the chopping block is the Second Amendment, and given current trends, those in opposition to constitutional rights will likely make some decent headway against it. </p>
<p>Mark my words, and I've already seen Biden use this exact language, but gun violence will be referred to as a "public health emergency" or an "epidemic," not a crime issue. </p>
<p>Quote: “Gun violence in this country is an epidemic and it’s an international embarrassment. This is an epidemic for God’s sake and it has to stop.” - Joe Biden, before using executive orders to pass gun control without legislation</p>
<p>Pay close attention to the language used. Per Biden, the mouthpiece of the Democratic establishment, there is not a gun violence "problem," "issue," or anything like that. It is specifically an epidemic to him - which is legal justification for use of emergency powers to limit constitutional rights.</p>
<p>Similarly to how they used COVID being an "epidemic" and therefore a "public health emergency" (which grants the executive branch specific legal powers) to justify egregious preemption of rights and due process, they will use that same emergency power to override the Second Amendment.</p>
<p>Legally, there's probably not much to be done. The law is pretty settled in giving the government ridiculous power in a state of emergency. And I highly doubt that a soon-to-be Biden-packed Supreme Court will care much about enshrining the right to bear arms.</p>
<p>Keep an eye out for this - in the coming months, you will see media highlighting and cherry-picking instances of gun violence, and the propagation of the idea that gun violence is "contagious" like a disease. We have seen this already. </p>
<p>As an example, in the wake of the multiple mass shootings over the last couple months, this headline from the Washington Post was published:
 https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mass-shootings-contagious/2021/04/03/5d826b52-93b4-11eb-9668-89be11273c09_story.html</p>
<p>The media will engender hatred of guns, foster suspicion of gun owners/supporters, cultivate fear in viewers, create a narrative that law-abiding gun owners are responsible for mass shootings and other criminal activity, and state that the only way to reduce such things is to take away guns from those who own and use them lawfully (as opposed to targeted measures to keep guns away from prior criminals who commit the overwhelming majority of such violence.) </p>
<p>This is the same method they have used for associating rights to association, protest, practice of religion, speech, travel, and bodily autonomy with COVID deaths since the start of 2020. By tying the two together, they have created a belief among many in our country that anyone who wishes to exercise those rights is responsible for the deaths of innocents, and should be punished.</p>
<p>The idea is that even if one personally does nothing wrong, they can indirectly harm others through exercising their rights, and therefore the rights must be removed and the person must be castigated. </p>
<p>This is necessary to create the collectivist and easily-controlled society that will not only gladly accept the New Normal, but beg the powers that be to subjugate them even harder.</p>
<p>We must all remain vigilant and engage in civil disobedience should any such tyrannical attempts come to pass. Start paying attention to the news - you will see this trend just as I have. The right to bear arms will be the next one lost if we do nothing to protest this slippery slope.</p></p>

        <p>You mean mostly Democrat on Democrat violence that occurs in predominantly Democrat run cities, most of which have both populations and mayors advocating to defund their police forces? Makes total sense in their world I guess.</p>

        <p>Likely right, but not top down by Biden, I think. Any EO by Biden would be ignored by too many like FL, TX &amp; SD ignore his mask nonsense. Sure, he can decree crazy on Federal property, but the States can &amp; have ignored him. </p>
<p>Same with banning guns by EO. However, States &amp; cities can! Several have &amp; it took Supreme Court to even budge complete bans in Chicago &amp; DC.</p>
<p>Note to the goobers dreaming of killing anyone- those were budged by boring people in court not gunfights &amp; bodybags. Put your bullet back in your pocket, Barney &amp; Lighten up, Francis.</p>
