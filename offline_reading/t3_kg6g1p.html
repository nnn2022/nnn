        <p>This will become 'we need to keep some restrictions to save the environment!' But there won't be a 'we.' The 100 companies responsible for 70% of emissions will not be affected. Journalists, politicians, and 'high-value persons' will get travel passes (as they do now under several countries' Covid restrictions).</p>
<p><em>We</em> will have to give up substantial food, recreational journeys, and loved ones who don't live with us: they - the state including its contractors and intellectual - will fly around the world on big private jets with household bodyguards and retainers to tell us how great it is. This isn't a theory of any sort. It is what they do <em>now</em>.</p>

        <p>I mean we're only being allowed to work without being allowed to do the things that actually make life worth living. Sure, we're being paid, but what do we spend the money on? More video games? And for some people thanks to lockdown they don't even have enough money for food and rent never mind video games. Typical you only make it about masks when you want to belittle the things we're saying.</p>

        <p>What the fuck were you doing before covid that you can't do other than go to bars/restaraunts. If thats what makes life "worth living" as opposed to spending time with your family and friends or practicing a hobby, I wonder what your life was like before the pandemic. And damn I wonder why people can't afford rent or food in the middle of a pandemic when other 1st world countries were easily providing stimulus to their citizens. The only difference between now and 12 months ago is that you can't go get drunk in a public place, in most states you actually can do this now. Considering that "total enslavement" is delusional and you're a fuckinf pissy if you think so. The only reason you don't wanna wear a mask is because you're a selfish piece of shit who doesn't care about others.</p>

        <p>That's it, resort to personally attacking me.</p>
<p>A lot of my life revolved around music, and while I can still practice it as a hobby it's lost a lot of what I loved about it. We are not allowed to rehearse or perform and the excitement with the events and especially the festive season was the most amazing thing for me. I know I'm not alone in that. I also lost a lot of my social circle from not being able to see them through music. Just sharing my personal experience.</p>
<p>The spontaneity and excitement of life is the joy of it, the wonderful new experiences and the many people you meet. If we aren't allowed to go out and meet our friends, and experience new things, meet new people, visit places and all of the other wonderful things life has to offer, then what are we doing? Without the events and plans to separate the days and months, life becomes mundane, dull and you don't make the memories you're here for.</p>
<p>And I am able to spend time with my family. I am lucky enough not to be separated from them, and my family have kept me going. But as much as I love them, a lot of memories you make with your family are at events, and different places. And while I can't deny the times you can have just at home, there is such a thing as balance. My hobbies are the other thing keeping me going. I practice art and music. But as much as art keeps me going, it simply cannot substitute for everything that I love about my normal life.</p>
<p>Finally, about the stimulus. All I can say to you is that when people are being given sometimes as low as 40% of their income, it's not enough. Some still have none at all. And it will not save the small businesses.</p>
