        <p>There is no scientific evidence for any necessity for ANY extraordinary measure, including ANY synthetic molecule.</p>
<p>The idea that "we must find some synthetic molecule to use" is drug-problem based thinking induced on the population by pharmaceutical industry to serve their self-interests of preventing people from learning to be healthier on their own with ordinary means, especially including starting to get adequate nutrition.</p>
<p>In science, before you can propose that any extraordinary measure should (or must) be taken, you have to consider the ordinary and if the ordinary is being properly adhered to or not.</p>
<p>Actual science is well aware that significant portions of the population in EVERY nation around the world do NOT intake even the bare minimums of one or more nutrients (often multiples) known to be required by the immune system to function properly, much less good healthy amounts.</p>
<p>Those statistics are dramatically worse among certain cross-sections of the population; specifically those cross-sections that are also observed to have been having the most trouble with covid.</p>
<p>Ignoring the ordinary and leaping to propose something extraordinary is marketing, not science.</p>
<p>In marketing you can, and generally <em>should</em>, ignore anything that is not consistent with your self-interests.  In fact, it's best if you can outright prevent people from even <em>thinking</em> about, much less TALK about anything that's not consistent with your self-interests.</p>
<p>Give up your drug problem, and start learning how to be happier and healthier with proper application of ordinary measures such as starting to get proper nutrition, and as little synthetic molecule and other extraordinary measure use as practical.</p>
<p>Of course some times some people may need to use synthetic molecules and/or other extraordinary measures, but actual science says that checking ordinary measures must be properly met first whenever practical.</p>

<p>?</p>
<p>Yes, I respect that you are showing what that email contained.</p>
<p>I don't respect that people leap to drug-problem based thinking with no scientific evidence to support the idea that proper application of the ordinary is meaningfully inadequate.</p>
<p>That's simply marketing, and that marketing has been the lion's share of how any why there's been such a bizarre response to this nutritional crises brought to light by the challenge of a virus only a little more tricky than influenza... While everybody STILL continues to ignore that it's a nutritional crises, and STILL continues to demand some extraordinary measure to save them from their own willful and wanton ignorance of and deception about nutrition.</p>
