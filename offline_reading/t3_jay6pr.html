        <p>Misses the point completely, it's not about "defeating the virus", this thing is social. It's over when people in power say it's over.</p>

        <p>We can end this now by tossing our masks in the trash and turning off the TV and social media. We don't have to wait until our governments and scientists decide.</p>
<p>Would've you have noticed there was virus going around without them? Average Joes like me would say no.</p>

        <p>Thanks for posting this.</p>
<p>It's always important to read reports like this from those who advise the Central Bankers and McKinsey does just that.</p>
<p>Nothing is set in stone.</p>
<p>From what I've analyzed, they've scheduled this thing to go on until 2025.</p>
<p>2025 is an interesting year because that the year the Deagle Population Models report that 80% of those who live in the USA will be dead. How this happens, I don't know?</p>
<p>But Deagle is another tool of the Central Bankers.</p>
<p>Things are very fluid. THEY, the Central Bankers and Fed and the WEF have never done this before. Used a virus as cover to implement their NWO.</p>
<p>Knowing they really don't know what they are doing and are relying on a super computer to predict outcomes means things are not set in stone.</p>
<p>We must fight back.</p>
<p>We must not let them control the plan.</p>
<p>Unless we fight back, their plan becomes much easier to implement.</p>
<p>It's best to not be docile now. Organize. Educate and fight back locally.</p>
<p>Local officials are stooges who are not used to being challenged.</p>

        <p>Essential workers reached herd immunity in April with only a tiny handful of deaths. Nursing home deaths are a different story because nursing home residents only account for 1% of the United States population and account for 50% of the deaths. </p>
<p>Think of that for a moment. 1% of the population makes up 50% of the deaths. </p>
<p>The danger for the rest of the population ended months and months ago.</p>
<p>This article you posted says the US wonâ€™t reach herd immunity until next year when we had it a long time ago.  Hell, we just had a no mask bike rally of 500,000 people and only 8 deaths were linked to it.  0.0016% is pretty good. We have herd immunity in the States.</p>
