    <strong>I need help</strong>
    <p><p>So... my 64 yo immunocompromised mother, went against everything and is about to get her second jab..</p>
<p>I’ve fought tooth and nail to show her some truth as we are coasts apart...</p>
<p>I know she’s disregarded everything.</p>
<p>Whatever. Her loss.</p>
<p>My question is:</p>
<p>How do i drop my anger and frustration towards her?</p>
<p>I feel really offended she didn’t even bother trying to listen to a word I say, which makes me feel resentful.</p>
<p>I know she’s gone soon, how do I cope with this anger and enjoy the little moments we still have together?</p>
<p>How do I remain calm and peaceful knowing she’s volunteered for her own demise?</p>
<p>Every time we speak I just want to tell her how disappointed and angry I am towards her.</p>
<p>I’ve told her that, and she gives zero shits.</p>
<p>But, we’re best friends. She’s my homie!</p>
<p>I hate to be the gloomy guy, but this is the only place where there’s like minded people like me.</p>
<p>Some input would be great!</p></p>

        <p>Sorry that you're in this predicament. It's very difficult to see a close family member in a bad situation. My only advice would be to pretend she never got the vaccine and be grateful for the time you have left with her if you truly care for her. Don't bring up the subject matter anymore of vaccination around her if you can help it.</p>

        <p>I’m in the same exact situation it weird. </p>
<p>You just have to accept that she is who she is. She is her own person who makes her own choices. </p>
<p>Just enjoy the time you have with her. Try to forget about it like another commenter said. Still do the things you do. And remember that everyone dies sometime.</p>
