    <strong>Now the Family Peer Pressure is coming in.</strong>
    <p><p>Right on schedule. I wish I could be shocked. But I’m not. Because I’m a Conspiracy guy the narrative is very predictable unfortunately. </p>
<p>4th of July Holiday is coming along for us Americans.My Dad tried saying some of the family are worried about you not getting the shot. They want you to get the shot before the 4th. </p>
<p>I’m like no thank you. We don’t know the long term side effects.</p>
<p>My Dads Response: Well Popi, your Aunt, and Uncle already got it. </p>
<p>Me: They already had kids. </p>
<p>My Dads well your female adult cousins are getting (High School age to early 20s.) </p>
<p>Me: Dumb. They shouldn’t. </p>
<p>Dad: Your sisters getting it.</p>
<p>Me: Why she already had Chinese Virus? There’s no need to take unnecessary risk. </p>
<p>Dad: Well are you fine with not seeing them on 4th of July if you don’t get it? </p>
<p>Me: We didn’t see them at all last year. I can wait this out. One more Holiday won’t hurt. </p>
<p>Dad: Well what about all the vaccines you took? </p>
<p>Me: Those were FDA approved. We know the long term side effects of it and it took years to develop. This wasn’t even a year with massive political pressure. They skipped the safety steps. </p>
<p>He walked away after that. </p>
<p>Feels good. Beat a Mask Nazi today at there own game. And disarmed the Family Peer Pressure. My Parents aren’t Liberal either. Full on Republican like me. I’m actually surprised they gave in to the Peer Pressure to take the jab. </p>
<p>This is a waiting game. If I know the media narrative as well as I think I do this will all magically go away once Kamala Harris gets installed. Either in 2024, or if “Joe Biden has a accident(falling up the stairs again). And Pelosi and Kamala 25th him.</p></p>

        <p>Stay strong, I am the only one in my family without it either...</p>
<p>Also next time remember to add that:</p>
<p>Over 99% of the population survive Covid perfectly fine, this huge majority of people survive it because their bodies natural immune system are capable of producing the antibodies to fight off and kill Covid-19.</p>
<p>So it is only that very tiny percentage(less than 1%) of people that need the vaccine as they have very weak immune systems.</p>
<p>Innate natural immunity is ALWAYS better than artificial, that is one of the golden rules of immunology.</p>
<p>So inject the vulnerable and leave everyone else alone to carry on as normal, that is the way we overcome every infectious disease and Covid is no different.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://thecanadianreport.ca/is-this-leaked-memo-really-trudeaus-covid-plan-for-2021-you-decide/">it’s not going away any time soon.</a> Yes, I know that’s a Canadian link, but if you look around, the same thing is repeating itself in every country in the whole Western world. </p>
<p>You’re spot on to not get the vaccine, but the pandemic <a href="https://www.iceagefarmer.com/2021/04/06/absolute-slavery-zero-carbon-agenda-deconstructed/">is just the opening move for a much bigger agenda.</a></p>
<p>As for the family members of yours that haven’t been vaccinated yet, try showing them <a href="https://www.deconstructingconventional.com/post/18-reason-i-won-t-be-getting-a-covid-vaccine">this article</a> and <a href="https://themostbeautifulworld.com/blog/vaccine-studies">these studies</a>, which clearly explain why they should not receive the COVID vaccine.</p>

        <p>Many boomers are surprisingly cucked when it comes to the covid vaccine.</p>
<p>My father has always been a based realist, but he recently suggested I take the shot. He didn’t pressure me or anything, but he didn’t even entertain my explanation about why I’m not taking it. </p>
<p>After seeing how shady the government has been lately I don’t get why he is trusting of the vaccine. </p>
<p>I feel like the idea of it being toxic is just too horrifying for some people. Maybe they want us to take it because they know our doubts are rational and it’s freaking them out about their own choices. </p>
<p>Like, unless we submit they can’t compartmentalize their own inner anxiety regarding the vaccine.</p>
<p>Everyone in the fam except for my <em>based</em> mom and I have gotten it. I’m just glad that all of my sisters are done having kids. If any of them were younger I would be seriously freaking out about it.</p>

        <p>My friend's dad got the vaccine even though he didn't want it after pressure from his kids. Hes been sick with a fever for a week now. My friend is pissed cause her siblings still defend the vaccine and shrug their shoulders. Meanwhile no doctor will see him in case he has covid he has to go to the hospital 🤦🏻‍♀️ he's finally been able to get a covid test and he tested positive! Just a big coincidence though.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry you have to go through this with your family.  Everyone in Team Reality is to some extent.</p>
<p>Your decision to forgo the shot is one I wholeheartedly support.  I'm going to decide if I get the shots or not in 2023.  I'm hoping after that amount of time the wave of cancer or encephalopathy has either happened or proven that it won't.</p>
<p>Did you see about the chemical and Parkinson's this week?  They think you can be exposed to it with no harm for 25!! years before it causes Parkinson's.  No way I'll be able to not join the mRNA medical revolution for 25 years if the first few years seem harmless.</p>
