    <strong>Replying to someone who thinks I'm part of a cult.</strong>
    <p><p>Hello u/Niko747_ , in response to your Chat Request, I will write out my answers to you. </p>
<p>&rt;Hey man just out of curiosity why do you believe in the <strong>*cult of anti-vaccine?</strong>
&rt; </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>By using "cult of anti-vaccine", you're not only belittling me, but also sending out a strong and clear message that you're already ingrained in your position that vaccines are safe. I'm not part of a cult, but if you see me as a cultist or a member of a cult, then that's on you. I just have my concerns. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm pro-healthy lifestyle, pro-choices, pro-medicine. I am against coercion, fear-tactics, bullshit propaganda, shaming or belittling others in order to take something from Big Pharma (who has a broken track-record of honesty), and I question why this is being pushed on us for a virus no more harmful than a seasonal cold. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&rt;I’m currently doing a psychology write up about <strong><em>paranoid schizophrenics</em></strong> in relation to <strong><em>conspiracy theorists</em></strong> and the subreddits you frequent show <strong><em>high levels of intense paranoia and delusion</em></strong> amongst the users and your name showed up a bunch so I decided to message you. 
&rt;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Again, by saying "write up about paranoid schizophrenics in relation to conspiracy theorists and the subreddits", you're already labelling me as one. That's fucking insulting. So anyone who questions the lame-stream narrative is equal to a conspiracy paranoid quack? Wow, way to go to build trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It doesn't have to be about conspiracies dude, it can be genuinely questioning what I see things as very questionable decisions, or where common sense or even logic is thrown out the window, and replaced with what I call skewed statistics and dishonesty from the media, the government and from medical authorities. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I see actual doctors, nurses, former health officials, and scientists have their YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Patreon, Instagram, and other social media accounts all shut down or banned, then free speech is dead, and only helps me and others see that the government &amp; Big Pharma does not have our best interests at heart. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I've also seen these brave truth tellers be threatened with violence, or outed at their place of employment, or other things harmfully done towards them. Do you think that's winning the hearts of those of us who were merely questioning all of this since last February? Yeah, good luck with that. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&rt;Do you <strong><em>believe</em></strong> the things you see from <strong><em>unqualified sources?</em></strong>
&rt;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Did you ever research the word "believe"? Belief/Believe is such a strong word. It's not that I "believe", it's that I question anything and everything that I experienced throughout my lifetime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I even question things that I normally agree with, as sometimes I need to perform my own research. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again, I review information from reputable medical and scientific professionals, who are of sound mind and body, but have been shunned by their peers for not towing the party line regarding covid-19.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&rt;Do you actually believe the <strong><em>pseudosciences</em></strong> behind the “facts” being spread throughout your community? 
&rt;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Again, you're trying to sway the conversation by coming out of your boxing ring corner with "pseudosciences" crap. Are there not truths to thing that could have valid points of contention? We now know Galileo was speaking the truth about how the world was round, yet vilified by the establishment (by the authorities) as well as vilified by his neighbors and country-men because they only followed their own "beliefs". No open mindedness, no civil discourse, nothing.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I try to cite my sources as much as possible, but I tend to find people of your ilk (i.e. the ones who are wishing upon us death, ill-will, and/or belittlement) to ignore or make-up excuses whenever we do cite our sources. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are some things that I can agree with and some that I can't, but I always keep an open-mind about things.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&rt;Why does the science not make sense for this vaccine but literally <strong><em>every other vaccine has been foolproof fine?</em></strong>
&rt; </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To keep my answer short, I find any covid-19 related vaccine (more akin to gene therapy) as rushed, and pushed by both private and public entities. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have a very strong distrust of government, Big Pharma, corporations, and the medical industry for continually lying or covering up past issues that still plague the good citizens around the world. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have our immune systems, so let's use them, nurture them, and live our lives strong and free. Here, just <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5682224/"><strong>read this</strong></a> to get a better understanding of where I stand on the issue of vaccines vs. our own immune systems. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&rt;This is in no way <strong><em>an aggressive message</em></strong>, I’m just genuinely curious on why you think the world is the way it is. 
&rt;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Based on your post history, I already have doubts as to your true intention. All I can say is that you come off as passive aggressive, but your curiosity is a good thing I think, so long as you are being honest with me. So far I have been honest with you. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you had started off with "Hi, I sincerely wanted to know what concerns you have with the covid vaccines rolling-out", then I would have had a bit more trust with you, but unfortunately you blew that with with "why do you believe in the <strong><em>cult of anti-vaccine?</em></strong>" Yeah, that rubbed me off definitely in the wrong way. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&rt;If you can provide any <strong><em>valid sources</em></strong> for anything you explain it would be great to insert in to my write-up. Thanks! 
&rt;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can start off with <a href="https://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/msm-finally-begins-admitting-the-pcr-false-positive-cover-up-the-real-world-experiment-exposed/"><strong>this podcast</strong></a>, and then continue researching the rest of <a href="https://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/"><strong>the website.</strong></a> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw5ldWr9QD0"><strong>this</strong></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And finally, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7ibaXq3iUA"><strong>this excellent take on how Koch's postulates were not being followed</strong></a> is where it all started for me when I knew we were being bamboozled. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&rt;(In case you were wondering I have lost 3 family members/close friends to covid/post covid effects. Nobody I know in my inner circle/people I know from work/school who has been vaccinated has had any adverse effects. So I have very close relation to this stuff and it’s really infuriating people like you exist, <strong><em>but it’s fun to write about y’all I will admit.</em></strong>)
&rt;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I'm terribly sorry for your loss. You have my sincere condolences. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I may ask, when did they pass away, what were their age groups, did any of them have pre-existing conditions (i.e. did they pass away with co-morbidities, and how many did they have), were they always wearing masks, were they ever in a lockdown state/town/city, were they ever intubated with a breathing apparatus before they passed away?  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By writing <strong><em>"but it’s fun to write about y’all I will admit."</em></strong> you definitely come off as a sociopath or psychopath. I really don't believe you when you say you have lost 3 family members or close friends, but it's the internet, so what do I know. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And just because you wrote <strong><em>"Nobody I know in my inner circle/people I know from work/school who has been vaccinated has had any adverse effects."</em></strong> doesn't make anyone else's suffering or questioning of this scamdemic any less valid. Get off your high horse. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&rt; If you don’t want to converse let me know but <strong><em>I’ll try to talk to you from a neutral perspective</em></strong> as I’m trying to be unbiased as possible for research purposes. Thanks in advance for your reply!
&rt;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No, I actually don't like the private messaging system for these types of topics, as there is a lot of propaganda out there right now, and there's more than enough people who hate/despise people like me. We are constantly targeted for just questioning or having concerns. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did you not see how r/CovidVaccinated was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/n8xpzf/rcovidvaccinated_mods_have_intentionally_removed/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link"><strong>deleting posts from those who had adverse reactions to the vaccines?</strong></a> It's shit like that (i.e. limitations of free speech or banning people) that not only enrage me, but causes me to have great fear for my future and everyone else's future. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I checked and saw you have made some posts in this subreddit, but <strong>you come off as being very insincere, and wish us all ill-will or harm.</strong> Furthermore, to help protect myself as well as be an open book, I have cc'd the moderators u/SpiderImAlright, u/evergreen193, u/coolchewlew, u/hab-bib, u/QueenRowana, u/freshhy88, u/Harryisamazing, and u/CrimsonSun99. </p>
<p>The reason why I did this is that I just want to keep this discourse civil &amp; open, as I have a high level of distrust whenever someone messages me that I suspect is not who they say they are, but I wanted to give this correspondence a chance at least in building some dialogue.</p>
<p>I will say this one last time, <strong>you can go ahead and take the shot. It's your choice and free will. I will never try to stop to you from your decision making.</strong> But I too wish for the same rights as you, where <strong>I don't want to be coerced, shamed, belittled, harmed or forced into agreeing with these bullshit mask mandates, lockdowns or rushed-out &amp; highly contentious vaccines (aka gene therapy concoctions).</strong> </p>
<p>PLEASE LEAVE THIS SUBREDDIT ALONE! I MEAN YOU NO HARM, SO PLEASE DON'T WISH US ANY HARM &amp; DON'T ANTAGONIZE US ANYMORE!!!</p></p>

        <p>Exactly. I'm tired of our sub being called a cult society. Like, wtf?? We all have gut instincts that are screaming out that nothing makes sense, and we're being hoodwinked. JFC, sometimes I wish I could go all out on these mofos, but then I want to keep civility and rational discourse alive.</p>

        <p>If you don't trust the government (FDA, CDC, CFIA, Health Canada, etc) to tell you a medicine or vaccine is safe to use, then who do you trust?</p>

        <p>The thing is, when you've suffered from Big Pharma, you turn towards people like Robert Kennedy Jr, or Del Bigtree, or Dr Carrie Madje, and I could go on and on and on. </p>
<p>I'll do my own research, find a doctor who can properly explain to me the pros and cons of taking a particular medicine, and make my own decisions. </p>
<p>By the way, the FDA consists of former Big Pharma execs, the CDC has made it more difficult to gather qualitative data, Health Canada is a joke (they used to stand up for something). </p>
<p>Why are you here? Just to mock or harass us? Go take your shot, leave us alone! I mean you no harm, so please don't harass, coerce, force, shame or belittle me for making my own choices, which don't harm you in any way!</p>
