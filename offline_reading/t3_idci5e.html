        <p>FYI, here's an executive summary on COVID-19 I try to keep current: </p>
<p>&rt;SARS-CoV-2 is <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.13.20101253v2">less lethal</a> than we <a href="https://forecasters.org/wp-content/uploads/Ioannidisetal_03082020-1.pdf">initially</a> assumed (for every 1,000 infected, less than 7 people have died, i.e. conservative estimate of overall IFR <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.03.20089854v4">under 0.7%</a>, and more recent estimates <a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/estimating-the-infection-fatality-ratio-in-england/">as low as 0.3%-0.5%</a>, with two important attributes: <a href="https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2020/07/13/covid-risk">heavy age-stratification</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-53192532">rapid decline</a> in fatality rates due to ongoing <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20477724.2020.1785782">progress in treatment</a>. Currently in efficacy trials, <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6505/752">monoclonal antibodies</a> may help curb the pandemic even before vaccines arrive. Between <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/08/04/science.abd3871">20%-50%</a> of people likely have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-020-0389-z.pdf">pre-existing immunity</a> to SARS-CoV-2 from the other circulating "common-cold" coronaviruses, which entails that <a href="https://reaction.life/we-may-already-have-herd-immunity-an-interview-with-professor-sunetra-gupta/">the threshold</a> for reaching <a href="http://archive.is/rQjZV">population-level</a> immunity to the virus is <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.20160762v1">lower</a> than initially assumed. Ongoing <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.20176636v1">selective pressure</a> means that the virus tends to <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2820%2931757-8">mutate into less lethal</a> strains. The <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/herd-immunity-is-still-key-in-the-fight-against-covid-19/amp?__twitter_impression=true">majority</a> of infected people experience mild symptoms or are fully asymptomatic (i.e. they need to get tested to even know they have been infected), with only a minority of people experiencing longer-term <a href="https://sebastianrushworth.com/2020/08/04/how-bad-is-covid-really-a-swedish-doctors-perspective/">complications</a>. Even very mild forms of infection are now known to confer <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867420310084">lasting immunity</a>. The existence of longer-term complications from respiratory infections in a minority of patients is well-known in the medical community: a comparison of complications in SARS-CoV-2 with those from the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3949874/">strep throat</a> and the common <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/irv.12470">flu</a> is useful for getting a sense of perspective. Equally useful is to recall the fear-mongering the media did during the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/ibcfji/what_if_herd_immunity_is_closer_than_scientists/g1whin1/">H1N1</a> epidemic, with the eerily-similar worry of novel long-term side effects that turned out to be hyperbole. 
<a href="http://balancedresponse.ca/open-letter/">Twenty three</a> respected epidemiologists have recently proposed a <a href="http://balancedresponse.ca/statement/">balanced</a> approach that acknowledges the <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=12355353">futility</a> of trying to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02402-5">eradicate</a> the virus at this stage in the pandemic and the importance of a return to living <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/08/containing-the-pandemic-isnt-a-job-for-cops/615298/">vibrant</a> lives, in full cognizance of the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2020-08-03/who-says-studies-put-coronavirus-mortality-rate-at-0-6-video">actual</a> level of risk posed by the virus. <a href="https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/285341">Fear</a> is not a good mental state from which to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-08-13/covid-spread-is-forcing-scientists-to-rethink-herd-immunity">appraise evidence</a> and decide <a href="http://archive.is/jvmoo">appropriate</a> actions - the mess over <a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/">masks</a> and <a href="https://www.psandman.com/col/Corona29.htm">lockdowns</a> is a case in point.</p>

        <p>Go ahead! I wrote it in the hope to get it disseminated widely, to help fight the madness, not for some personal glory for "clme".

        <p>This summary is worthy of its own post, only thing that could make it better is numbering the hyperlinks and add a work cited section at the end. Alot of those sources are medical journals, it'd make the doomers squirm seeing a stack of legit sources at the end. Great job!</p>

        <p>These people complain about everything, no amount of rational thoughts or academic sources will appease them because it doesn't come from only <em>their</em> sources or are misconstrued somehow because it doesn't line up with their agendas or beliefs. I've never seen so many people divided and angry at each other for such mundane things, not just in the internet, but in real life. I think the social repercussions from this has done more damage than the disease itself. </p>
<p>It'd be outright ignorant to say this thing doesn't exist or hasn't been a problem, but the lock down has been drawn out <em>way</em> too long. The right to free thought and individualism is at an all time low through a false sense of social justice and misinformation. I just hope that the people on the fence see these kind of well thought out posts with credible sources and think "We kind of over did it, huh?"</p>

        <p>Did you see paper the whole world cited from London in the spring? Neil Ferguson and his "peer reviewed" prediction of 50,000 deaths daily by summer for the UK alone?</p>
<p>BTW lots of major medical journals publish pre-prints along with peer reviewed, does that mean we shouldn't trust them as well. </p>
<p>How do you explain all the conclusions that turn out to be false but was #peerreviewed?</p>
<p>Peer reviewed is great when your researching decades of studies and data on a subject. Basically every new thing we learn about covid comes from pre-prints, peer review done correctly takes months and years as other scientists try to replicate outcomes and find issues present.</p>

        <p>These are the right numbers. I like to think of it like this though.  It affects everyone equal.  So 7.5 billion roughly in the world means even at .7% the lethality is 52,500,000.</p>

<p>Nobody said it was.  But it's basically a 2x flu.  If you are above the age of 2, you have already been exposed to more cumulative mortality risk due to respiratory infection than COVID.</p>

        <p>Cumulative mortality risk and acute risk are really different for people with developing immune systems, especially children that young. Not to mention this virus is novel, and we already have precautions and treatments for different respiratory illnesses</p>
<p>Maybe the media should be pushing more facts than sensationalization from either points of view, because i do agree with OP</p>

        <p>Yes, that's a fairly mild, typical flu season.  The IFR for COVID is also currently an estimate, and I'd be surprised if anything higher than 0.5% emerges.  I think that's an upper bound.  We still need to learn about the extent of T-cell immunity in the population which is far harder to quantify than through serological/PCR testing.</p>
<p>If memory serves, Stanford put COVID somewhere in the 0.26% range with regional variability.</p>

        <p>Ah yea, my grandfather who survived the flu no problems , died of Covid. I don’t wanna hear that bullshit either that he was old. So what? He was driving, running a restaurant, handling his bills and the restaurant’s bills. Walking, running, exercising, healthy as he could be at his age. No issues , just old. He would have been like Jack Lelane, in his 90s and healthy. </p>
<p>But no, COVID got him and it wasn’t anything else. I couldn’t say goodbye.</p>

<p>I'm sorry that your grandfather died from COVID after surviving the flu, but the reality is that hundreds of thousands <em>don't</em> survive the flu.  Undoubtedly, there are many out there who will survive COVID only to get taken out by something.  This is the reality of life and mortality.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry for your losses. We all have losses and they suck. It doesn’t mean we should hide away from life forever. I think I speak for many in this sub when I say that we could easily tolerate time-limited restrictions, but have good reason to fear that these restrictions will continue long-term. And that chills us to the bone. For people like us, a life without hugs, unmasked smiles, singing, dancing, performing arts, celebrations, and “freedom to roam” (to use the quaint Swedish term) is hardly worth living.</p>

        <p>Covid is 100% real and dangerous.   And it gets increasingly dangerous as one gets older.  However, the case counting and death counting is nonsense and a lot is total bs.    </p>
<p>The US makes up approximately 5% of the global population but approximately 25% of the of the case count and death count?    This despite the fact that that in spite of the fact that so many of the best hospitals in the world are here.   I don't believe that.</p>
<p>The US simply does a ton of cases and is a huge country.   If you tests tons of mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic people, you will find cases.   This is a good thing!    The darker side, is how nursing homes and hospitals are classifying cases and death for financial gain.</p>

<p>This is why you are seeing so many dying with covid patients being classified as dying from covid.</p>

        <p>The counting data is fucked and being manipulated. I like to use the excess death model (or how many more people have died this year than last year) for a better picture of what’s actually happening that won’t change when that find a bunch of new tests that were sitting on someone’s desk. </p>
<p>But, that more accurate data doesn’t change the conclusion that the US is handling this exceptionally bad. When it comes to viral growth, being 10% better at containment is the difference between flattening the curve and hockey stick growth.</p>

        <p>Cancer treatment is optional and doesn't require anybody but the patient to change their life. And yes, I'd support getting rid of the drinking age laws or at least dropping it to 18, and laws requiring people to wear a seat belt. Even though I wear mine every time I drive. If someone else doesn't want to, that's their business.</p>
<p>"Public safety" is being abused to take away people's rights. I'd rather have a little less safety, and be free to travel and meet up with other people whenever I want, and be able to make my own medical decisions free of coercion, than the mess we're in.</p>
<p>Anybody who wants to lock themselves down can. They don't <em>have</em> to go to restaurants and out shopping, it should be up to everyone to decide for themselves.</p>

        <p>Exactly. Not to mention the USA has TONS of urban density... And COVID, unsurprisingly, spreads in dense urban settings. That's why the Canadian news drives me crazy... It's nonstop "look how much better we handled this than the USA"... Yeah, because you have 10x less of a population and practically no urban density with the exception of 2 big cities. And unlike the 5 minute USA tests, we still don't get results until like 5 days later. So fuck off with that narrative, Canada.</p>

        <p>This same argument can be applied to a state like New Hampshire versus Massachusetts.  NH has no mask mandate (at least not that I'm aware) and very few people wearing masks.  Still the rate of COVID there is so much lower than MA, NY, etc. </p>
<p>Edit: I love New Hampshire.</p>

        <p>Money. </p>
<p>Cares act gave 20% more to hospitals if the patient was positive/presumed positive and more money for ventilated patients as well. So suicides, murders, ODs, car accidents, hospice patients, etc those all get labeled corona deaths so they get that extra 20% paycheck </p>
<p><a href="https://www.aha.org/advisory/2020-04-16-coronavirus-update-cms-releases-guidance-implementing-cares-act-provisions">American Hospital Association </a></p>
<p>And NYC was murdering thousands of patients by putting them on a ventilator as first line therapy because “China did it.” We would NEVER intubate a patient as first line therapy before all this since it damages the lungs and most people will never recover and will die on the vent. </p>
<p>That’s why there’s so many more deaths there than the rest of the country.</p>

        <p>You’re answering a question that was never asked. Let me go back <em>again</em>, to bring you up to speed on the conversation....        </p>
<p>If you read the OP, the claim is that the majority of coronavirus deaths are from a different cause, and incorrectly labeled as Covid for insurance purposes. What caused the extra deaths, that were then incorrectly labeled as coronavirus?       </p>
<p>You’re claiming the deaths really were from Covid, and that it’s nursing homes committing murder in order to defraud the government. That is absolutely a different argument than OP....           </p>
<p>If you would like to argue the merits of your ridiculous proposition that’s fine, but don’t pretend I’m the one with the reading comprehension problem.</p>

        <p>Because coronavirus is incredibly dangerous in the elderly population and Cuomo mandated nursing homes to accept covid positive admissions.   This let to a conflagration of nursing home deaths in NY.   </p>
<p>Did I deny ever deny that Covid is a serious public health issue?   These were my exact words:</p>
<p>"Covid is 100% real and dangerous. And it gets increasingly dangerous as one gets older."</p>
<p>My only point is that case counting and medicare shenanigans have led to a lot of bad information.   My issue is whether locking down the healthy population for a disease that clearly discriminates on an age and co-morbidity basis is really the best policy decision that we can make, and many of these decisions are being made by cherry-picking distorted data.</p>

        <p>The average and excess deaths are rather confusing terms, and ambiguous enough to tell any story.</p>
<p>What you are seeing in the spike of deaths when covid hit is more like - 'above what we projected based on other years when nothing interesting happens'.</p>
<p>What the others are explaining are reasons why the entire spike may be attributed to only covid, and why it could be much higher than it should've been if mistakes weren't made.</p>
<p>The reality is that spike occurs in a similar curve and time frame every several years due to  accumulation of the vulnerable who have not had a threat in years, and a nasty disease exploiting that.</p>
<p>What is often implied is that these deaths are All 'excess', 'unnecessary' and therefore 'preventable' forever, and that the rest of the year's deaths will still occur. But, since people cannot die twice, those deaths will be missing from the projection somewhere else and there is a drop below baseline.</p>

        <p>Did you actually read the article? The “monetary gain” is just for Medicare patients and it’s an insurance pay out. That’s just his insurance works. Medicare is just offering more money than they usually do if it’s a covid patient. The doctors themselves aren’t seeing a dime of that money. The hospitals? Sure. But not the docs. Not to mention fee.org has a super right-wing bias</p>

        <p>Ok.    So that incentivizes the hospitals to indicate covid as the cause of death to many patients who were unfortunately at the end of their mortality.    Is a stage 4 pancreatic cancer patient with days to live that contracts covid in the hospital really a covid death?</p>

        <p>Undoubtedly COVID contributed.  Why would you assume any single person on this sub would deny that?  The discussion here is about the appropriate policy response given risk that is not equally distributed or even among the most deadly pandemics the world has faced in the era of modern germ theory. </p>
<p>The discussion is also about relative costs and benefits and the value of maintaining normalcy for its own sake.  We tolerate a great deal of risk in order to live our lives in accordance with our principles of liberty.</p>
<p>Finally, I think a portion of the excess mortality is inadequately explained by the virus alone and may be driven by policy choices causing unintended harms.</p>

<p>I already addressed this:</p>
<p>&rt;elderly whose lives are behind them</p>
<p>And for all intents and purposes, most in their 60s and 70s are indeed chronically/terminally ill. It's called old age.</p>
<p>&rt;People like you rag on about freedom and liberty but only really believe in those things when it is convenient and pertains to yourself or your peers.</p>
<p>Okay? And? We're social animals, yes, but we can only really care about so many people. A few dozen to a few hundred at most. Our immediate friends and family. Perhaps a small town. Compassion spread across thousands, millions, and billions becomes thin, shallow, and hollow. Anyone who claims otherwise is delusional at best and deceptive at worst. We're pack animals, not hive animals. And we're all selfish.</p>
<p>&rt;You don't get to decide what makes for a "quality life" and you don't get to decide when people have lived long enough</p>
<p>Neither do you or anyone else. Except for the individual in question, of course, and perhaps immediate friends or family. So you should take care of you and yours, quit outsourcing responsibility for health and safety to others who don't know you or care about you.</p>

        <p>You’re right, I don’t get to decide as I’m not in a position of power. But I do get to express that sacrificing the young and the poor for the old (simplifying, but that’s essentially what’s happening) is biologically unnatural and morally reprehensible.</p>
<p>I myself am not young (63), though thankfully I have no known health issues and feel the same as I did at 25. I do not want future generations, including my children, to miss out on the opportunities I had. That’s what keeps me up at night, not the nursing home patient who may die a few months earlier than expected from Covid. And if I were that patient, I would be horrified to think the world had stopped for me.</p>

        <p>Lol, what I said is an attack now?  Come on.</p>
<p>Nobody doubts that COVID has contributed to abnormally high excess mortality.  Severe flu seasons do that, too. </p>
<p>I specifically answered the question OP asked: excess mortality is a result of COVID deaths + lockdown deaths.  The goal posts you accuse me of moving—my point that the degree of excess COVID mortality did not justify the response—relates to the fact that I don't see the risks of COVID as being proportional to the secondary harms of public policy, or indeed even as existentially abnormal as some believe.</p>
<p>By the way, most European countries are back near baseline mortality and have been for some time.  www.euromomo.eu</p>

        <p>Given the fairly standard epidemic curves across a variety of non-standardized nations and policy responses, I can only assume that the virus has largely run its natural course in most places, particularly those that were hit hardest.</p>
<p>I think the safest assumption is to stick with the long history of documented science and observe that viruses weaken, immune systems adapt, and the harvesting effect causes a lot of damage up front.  I don't see any reason to throw the entire paradigm of epidemiology out for this one particular virus.</p>

        <p>No. Spain, Italy, UK, Belgium all handled it worse than the US. France and Sweden were about the same. Germany, the Netherlands, the rest of the scandinavian countries handled it better. Its hard to compare the entire US to much of the smaller nations of Europe.</p>

        <p>The small countries handled it better? I guess. It's not  really that helpful to compare a tiny nation like San Marino or Estonia to an enormous country like the US. That can be said about most of eastern Europe and the Balkans as well. It's better to compare individual european countries with individual states. Compare Sweden to Michigan. Utah to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Romania to New York.</p>

        <p>How can anyone take this sub seriously when this shit comment is actually upvoted? </p>
<p>Literally no one has said it was as bad as any of the things you've said. The general concensus is it's pretty bad and needs to be taken seriously. How is that a controversial stance to take when you can literally look at excess death numbers all around the world and see how many people have died lmaoo...?</p>

        <p>How much did we spend on a yearly basis to prevent nuclear annihilation at the height of the cold war? Roughly 5-10% of GPD, if you say the entire military budget was dedicated to that cause, which it wasn't.</p>
<p>How much have we spent shutting down the economy? Well, 33% of GDP in economic contraction and $2T of direct spending at the federal level <em>so far</em> (10% of GDP), not counting any state or local initiatives ... </p>
<p>So it's either we think it's basically as bad as nuclear annihilation, or we massively overreacted - which one?</p>

        <p>Or one is just based in probability and one is a thing that literally happened. </p>
<p>Were any nukes used during the cold war? No. Clearly 10% was sufficient.</p>
<p>Is there an extremely infectious disease that was exponentially spreading and has already killed half a million people (Almost definitely more) across the entire world despite drastic measures? Yes. Clearly more money needed to be spent than the nukes. The issue even then isn't the amount of money spent but the fact that quicker, stricter and more decisive measures would have massively reduced the amount of spend that would have been needed anyway.</p>
<p>33% GDP spend was because of sceptics like you who refuse to act like this is a serious problem and the goverment who took way too long to lock the country down properly. You can literally look at the stats and see which countries took appropriate action because they're all the ones who are basically ready to open up borders to certain countries again.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How many deaths from enemy nukes during the cold war? 0. Clearly the spend was enough.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many deaths are there from Covid in America alone? 175k and constantly increasing. Clearly Covid was more important for spend yet decisive actions would have reduced spend massively.</p>
</li>
</ul>

        <p>So you're saying that the risk posed by COVID is indeed greater than the risk of thermonuclear war, and therefore the actions are justified? Or simply that nuclear war is a much easier, cheaper and simpler problem to deal with than COVID? That's fine, it's just the opposite of what you said previously, where you said it's outrageous to think that COVID compares to those things.</p>
<p>Also, the 33% drop in GDP is definitely not my fault, sorry. I understand the only way you can argue is to ad hom your opponents but c'mon, try to think at least slightly analytically. The drop in GDP is due to mandated closures on large sections of the economy, the closing of trade and travel etc. The disease has a ~0.7% fatality rate that mostly hits people that aren't in the workforce, it by itself doesn't cause a 30% drop in economic output.</p>

<p>&rt;    it’s just the opposite of what you said previously, where you said it’s outrageous to think that COVID compares to those things.</p>

<p>So why are other countries not dealing with giant economic losses when they followed proper procedures? It’s almost as if following procedures would lead to not completely shutting down our economy for months at a time.</p>
<p>&rt;    The drop in GDP is due to mandated closures on large sections of the economy, the closing of trade and travel etc. </p>
<p>Yet we can keep the stock market alive which is so loosely attached to how the country is actually doing. Almost as if we tried to follow proper procedures.. we wouldn’t have to shutdown continual months and wait for the Senate to come back from their recess to pass more relief bills. </p>

<p>&rt; So why are other countries not dealing with giant economic losses when they followed proper procedures? It’s almost as if following procedures would lead to not completely shutting down our economy for months at a time.</p>
<p>"Following procedures", it depends on what procedures. One procedure is shutting down. We can go through all the countries etc, it still doesn't make the economic performance of the US my fault. </p>

<p>God</p>

<p>We don't <em>have</em> to shut down. There is no "proper procedure". Like there's some British guy saying "ooh I'm sorry mate, but you didn't follow the procedure to get the license on this one, we're gonna have to shut you down, that's just how it goes mate". </p>

<p>That's correct, retired people in nursing homes spend less money than others. They also work less which is what matters for the GDP I'm quoting you. </p>
<p>I hate to break it to you, but 600,000 die every year from cancer, 500,000 die from heart disease, etc. etc. Yet the economy doesn't take a 30% dip. 1%, 5% even, I could see. 30% is ridiculous for that many people.</p>

<p>No fucking shit, because that wasn't a threat to every single day life and risking the spread of a virus? How are you that thick to not understand that? Do you think shutting down the country was going to stop a nuclear bomb from going off lol? </p>
<p>&rt;I gave you numbers on how much this crisis is costing the country, and you seem to waffle between saying it's justified and saying the comparison is outrageous. Which is it?</p>
<p>Costing the country? Now, why is it costing so much? Maybe because we weren't prepared because we disbanded a pandemic team? Maybe because of the delayed response to it even though we knew about it in January? Maybe because the government pumps fucking trillions into the stock market to keep it alive yet it doesn't even reflect anything other than million and billionaires wealth? The response is justified because dumbasses like you don't think it's a big deal.</p>
<p>&rt;This has nothing to do with anything, certainly not with any point I'm making. Also doesn't make sense ... yes the stock market is up due to the Fed ... yes it has nothing to do with the economy ... OK? Cool?</p>
<p>It does have to do with everything, the cost of this pandemic includes anything related to keeping the 'economy' alive right? Why wouldn't you include the idiotic trillions put into a stock market to make sure rich people stay rich? You can't just skimp out on what the money was spent on and make it a lump sum, that's ignoring the shit response from our government.</p>
<p>&rt;We don't have to shut down. There is no "proper procedure". Like there's some British guy saying "ooh I'm sorry mate, but you didn't follow the procedure to get the license on this one, we're gonna have to shut you down, that's just how it goes mate". </p>
<p>It's called wear a mask and stay fucking home. Why do you think other countries didn't take this hit? Like holy shit, you're beyond ignorant to believe the economy was forced to shutdown because of the virus, it was shutdown because people like you can't follow simple things and our government can't give us money to stay home cause that'd be sOcIaLiSm.</p>
<p>&rt;That's correct, retired people in nursing homes spend less money than others. They also work less which is what matters for the GDP I'm quoting you. </p>
<p>You're ignoring the actual impact it has on the economy, nursing home deaths aren't costing the US 33% of the GDP, people not wanting to follow simple procedures and crying about my freedumbs being violated are the reason we're in such an extended lockdown.</p>
<p>&rt;I hate to break it to you, but 600,000 die every year from cancer, 500,000 die from heart disease, etc. etc. Yet the economy doesn't take a 30% dip. 1%, 5% even, I could see. 30% is ridiculous for that many people.</p>
<p>Ever heard of excess mortality? Unexpected deaths cause an impact to the economy. The amount of people who die every year from cancer and heart disease and car accidents are expected, when you have an unexpected virus come along and murder 170k+ people, that's continuing to cause an impact on our economy. Just because ~60% of deaths are 65+ doesn't take away from the fact that the other 40% is everyone else below that. You're just pretending people dying has little effect on the economy because 60% are older.</p>

<p>OK, so Coronavirus is worse than the threat of nuclear annihilation, because nuclear annihilation wasn't everyday and as bad as the spread of a virus? </p>
<p>Please take a stance here. As I said NUMEROUS times you want to have it both ways. It's both laughable to compare corona to nuclear weapons, your first stance, but also corona is deserving of a far more drastic response?</p>
<p>Please tell me, which is worse, the threat of nuclear annihilation, or the coronavirus. Please clarify this - </p>
<p>&rt; Like holy shit, you're beyond ignorant to believe the economy was forced to shutdown because of the virus, it was shutdown because people like you can't follow simple things </p>
<p>First, please stop talking about me just because you have to make things a personal attack. You have no idea to what extent I follow simple things, I had a N95 in February. Just try to do better and flail about less.</p>
<p>And you're the guy talking about strawmen, lol</p>
<p>Obviously the virus didn't shut down the economy. Fear of the virus did. People became super afraid of everything and decided that they couldn't do anything because of this existential threat. I live in MA, where we have among the highest deaths per capita, but people pride themselves on how well we "locked it down" and "everyone is wearing masks" and how we beat it. We didn't. It's been over for like three months. We had almost the highest death toll (and people act like we beat it, and not like we lost), even though we were the most conscientious and nobody did an anti-mask protest. </p>
<p>Fear and panic took ahold in large amounts, and no respectable person could ever go outside much less meet someone else, until the bogeyman is proven to be gone. Literally killing people to do that. Gotta have that cloth over your face and never go outside. Oh, nobody died in my age group for two months? Oh, cloth masks do shit all? Oh, 100 homeless people are exchanging joints and whatever else steps from my apartment? Sure. But wearing the mask is super important and it's my fault for the economy tanking.</p>
<p>&rt; people not wanting to follow simple procedures and crying about my freedumbs being violated are the reason we're in such an extended lockdown</p>
<p>No, the people enforcing the lockdown are the reason we're in the lockdown. If the deaths were the reason, that would be a good reason. People crying is not a good reason for a lockdown.</p>
<p>Do you realize how childish, how petty you are? "People were crying so we had to destroy the economy"</p>
<p>Reasons to close the economy: </p>
<ol>
<li>People dying</li>
<li>
<p>As you mentioned, this isn't an issue "nursing home deaths aren't costing the US 33% of the GDP"</p>
</li>
<li>

<ul>
<li>Are more dying than acutally died? What happened to "flatten the curve"? Didn't we do that? </li>

<li>
<p>Because you're a politician that has to do something</p>
</li>
<li>

</ol>
<p>&rt; when you have an unexpected virus come along and murder 170k+ people, that's continuing to cause an impact on our economy</p>
<p>How much would you say? Would you say 1% like me? Or would you say it's equivalent to 1/3rd of the economy being shut down, and why?</p>

<p>Oh my god, why are you so bad are pretending to actually have a point? Nuclear annihilation means the world or a good part of the world is absolutely done for. There’s no prevention normal people can take every single day to prevent that, it’d be the decision of people way above us. Stop with this dumb analogy.</p>

<p>Holy shit, it’s almost like you’re apart of a country and not an isolated state. It’s almost like all of the country somewhat depends on each other and different industries to continue to thrive. It also depends on the size of your state and population which changes how often people interact from different areas.</p>
<p>&rt;    Fear and panic took ahold in large amounts, and no respectable person could ever go outside much less meet someone else, until the bogeyman is proven to be gone. Literally killing people to do that. Gotta have that cloth over your face and never go outside.</p>
<p>Nobody is saying don’t go outside, people are saying don’t interact with too many people. No one is saying to wear your mask inside when your in your home. You’re literally making shit up and pretending it’s majority beliefs and propaganda that was given out.</p>
<p>&rt;    Oh, cloth masks do shit all?</p>
<p>How many studies do you want to prove they do something?</p>
<p>&rt;    Oh, 100 homeless people are exchanging joints and whatever else steps from my apartment? Sure. But wearing the mask is super important and it’s my fault for the economy tanking.</p>
<p>What in the hell does homeless people smoking joints have to do with anything? No one is saying sharing shit like that is fine, you’re once again pretending and arguing with some other person in your mind making this shit up that people apparently don’t care about.</p>
<p>&rt;    No, the people enforcing the lockdown are the reason we’re in the lockdown. If the deaths were the reason, that would be a good reason. People crying is not a good reason for a lockdown.</p>
<p>We shutdown because there was such a surge of cases and deaths. You realize a sudden rush of people going to hospitals to get treated causes a little chaos right? That was the entire point of flattening the curve.</p>
<p>&rt;    Do you realize how childish, how petty you are? “People were crying so we had to destroy the economy”</p>
<p>Do you realize how stupid you sound putting quotes around shit I’ve never said? </p>
<p>&rt;    Reasons to close the economy:
 1. People dying
 ◦ As you mentioned, this isn’t an issue “nursing home deaths aren’t costing the US 33% of the GDP”</p>
<p>Congrats, you’ve once again ignored the fact that 40% of deaths are under 65 and are impacting the economy even heavier. You’re really fucking bad at taking things out of context. Did you just want to ignore everything else I wrote around that or sit here and play with your dick?</p>
<p>&rt;    2. Threat of people dying
 ◦ Are more dying than acutally died? What happened to “flatten the curve”? Didn’t we do that?</p>
<p>What the fuck are you even trying to say? “Are more dying than actually died?” Like what does this actually mean? I already talked about excessive mortality, if you could fucking read and absorb a single thing instead of your pea sized brain ignoring it all. Check the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm">CDCs chart</a> and expected deaths overtime. Or is it fake news because it proved your wrong?</p>
<p>Flatten the curve was to make sure hospitals don’t get overwhelmed, that was known from the start. There are plenty of videos and articles explaining that from March or are you too stupid to do any research beyond what you want to believe?</p>
<p>&rt;    How much would you say? Would you say 1% like me? Or would you say it’s equivalent to 1/3rd of the economy being shut down, and why?</p>
<p>I don’t know? I’m not an economist and am not going to pretend that I know an actual, properly analyzed answer. I doubt you are either because you’re literally proven wrong by its impact on our economy.</p>
<p>You’re ignoring me asking why other countries haven’t felt the same impact on their GDP. You’re ignoring a lot of the actual points I’m making and taking nearly every quote you’ve copy and pasted out of context. You’re an idiot who is arguing in bad faith constantly.</p>

        <p>&rt; Oh my god</p>
<p>OH MY GOD</p>
<p>&rt; why are you so bad are pretending to actually have a point? </p>
<p>OH MY GOD</p>
<p>&rt; I’ve said it was laughable to compare it to nuclear annihilation because one is the press of a button and done and the other continues to propagate throughout society as people interact.</p>
<p>So which is worse? Why can't you compare things? Are you deficient or something? </p>
<p>Let's make a continuum -</p>
<p>1) Nuclear strike, world ends immediately</p>
<p>2) Volcano erupts, blackens clouds, human era ends over 5 years as crops fail</p>
<p>3) Zombie plague strikes, people die over a 20 year period as no cure can be found</p>
<p>4) Climate change, world falls into sea over 50+ years </p>
<p>5) COVID 19, it continues to propagate throughout society as people interact (summarized by /u/youthedog4)</p>
<p>Wow you're right. It is laughable to think that we're spending more money on COVID than the entirety of the national defense budget during the Cold War.</p>
<p>&rt; There’s no prevention normal people can take every single day to prevent that</p>
<p>YES. Thank you. THIS is the key point.</p>
<p>People think that COVID is THEIR OWN RESPONSIBILITY. Unlike nuclear war, or cancer, or violent crime, drunk driving, meth abuse,   heart disease, or literally anything else that plagues the world  - COVID is somehow the personal responsibility of every individual themselves and it reflects upon them. </p>
<p>I mean, you have to know that's a joke. You have clearly internalized it in how you've come out with "it's YOUR fault" in each post. But it's not. It's a deadly infectious disease, it's not people inflicting harm on people.  </p>
<p>How did it come to this? How did you make it, in your mind, that the national COVID response is your own doing because you're right, or if it fails it's because your fellow citizens are idiots that ruined it for you? How did you make it into an individual thing? </p>
<p>Nuclear war, that's for people way above me. Global poverty, I can't really do anything. Climate change, I tried to call my Senator. Cancer, science just has to figure it out. BUT COVID IS WHERE PEOPLE MAKE A DIFFERENCE </p>
<p>It's because of political messaging basically. And that's why this entire thing has transcended the realities of what the virus is. </p>
<p>OK to your shit stirring - -- </p>
<p>&rt; It’s almost like</p>
<p>No NO NO </p>
<p>&rt; you’re apart of a country and not an isolated state</p>
<p>Not really, we have barred all travel outside of the Northeast without a quarantine, try to pay some attention. We haven't quite re-annexed Maine and declared independence but soon.</p>
<p>&rt;It’s almost like ...  all of the country somewhat depends on each other</p>
<p>idk why I respond at this point </p>
<p>&rt; What in the hell does homeless people smoking joints have to do with anything? No one is saying sharing shit like that is fine</p>
<p>Oh would you say it's not proper even? Were they not following the protocols? Would you like the homeless to behave?</p>
<p>The point is that there's massive non-compliance and there always was going to be. Not from people that argue with you on the internet or are politically involved, but from people who honestly could give a rats ass and are living their lives. So how you come out of it saying it's my fault, or the fault of people who call you out on how stupid the policy is, is ridiculous. </p>
<p>&rt; We shutdown because there was such a surge of cases and death</p>
<p>Ah that's a better answer than "it was shutdown because people like you can't follow simple things and our government can't give us money to stay home" like your last post literally said. Actual death is a good reason, I agree. </p>
<p>&rt; “People were crying so we had to destroy the economy” Do you realize how stupid you sound putting quotes around shit I’ve never said?</p>
<p>"crying about my freedumbs being violated are the reason we're in such an extended lockdown."</p>
<p>&rt; 40% of deaths are under 65 and are impacting the economy even heavier</p>
<p>Yes, those smaller fraction of deaths (&lt; 0.1% of Americans) probably impact the economy more like an average person dying, which considering that output is a combination of labor and capital, is well less than 0.1% of economic output, so I feel safe in saying that the drop in GDP is not directly due to the death or illness of the labor force and rather due to government policies.</p>
<p>&rt; sit here and play with your dick?</p>
<p>Ah now I know why you stuck around</p>
<p>&rt; asking why other countries haven’t felt the same impact on their GDP</p>
<p>Other countries that locked down did feel hard negative effects. You haven't looked into other countries or named any specifics. You bring it up as a red herring "oh other countries did better". If you actually want to get into the details of other countries go ahead, but this is an America-centered convo.</p>
<p>&rt; You’re an idiot who is arguing in bad faith constantly.</p>
<p>I mean, no u, you have no idea what you're talking about and can't stop name calling for the life of you. </p>
<p>ALMOST AS IF you are the idiot, huh what a world</p>

        <p>&rt;    So which is worse? Why can’t you compare things? Are you deficient or something?</p>
<p>I’ve explained twice now why you can’t compare it, do you need me to copy and paste it? You literally have it right there, stop asking for answers you have. Calling me deficient yet your goldfish ass brain can’t put fucking 2 and 2 together in front of your fucking face.</p>
<p>&rt;    Wow you’re right. It is laughable to think that we’re spending more money on COVID than the entirety of the national defense budget during the Cold War.</p>
<p>Never said covid was only that, that statement was in regards to why it was different you fucking smooth brain. Again, you’re ignoring tons of context.</p>
<p>&rt;    People think that COVID is THEIR OWN RESPONSIBILITY. Unlike nuclear war, or cancer, or violent crime, drunk driving, meth abuse, heart disease, or literally anything else that plagues the world - COVID is somehow the personal responsibility of every individual themselves and it reflects upon them.</p>
<p>Because you can spread it yourself you fucking moron.</p>
<p>&rt;    I mean, you have to know that’s a joke. You have clearly internalized it in how you’ve come out with “it’s YOUR fault” in each post. But it’s not. It’s a <strong>deadly infectious disease</strong>, it’s not people inflicting harm on people.</p>
<p>Well it’s actually a virus but you make a good point still, it’s infectious. Now how do viruses spread? Interacting with people. You really must be braindead.</p>
<p>&rt;    Nuclear war, that’s for people way above me. Global poverty, I can’t really do anything. Climate change, I tried to call my Senator. Cancer, science just has to figure it out. BUT COVID IS WHERE PEOPLE MAKE A DIFFERENCE</p>
<p>Lol comparing not spreading a virus to curing cancer and global poverty, you’re so far gone it’s hilarious. You probably think you’re so clever coming up with these when you probably can’t even think straight and that’s why it took you hours to respond, too drunk?</p>
<p>&rt;    It’s because of political messaging basically. And that’s why this entire thing has transcended the realities of what the virus is.</p>
<p>Nope, you already said it’s infectious thus proving the social responsibility you should have. You do understand that there are tons of public health laws about not going in public if you have infectious diseases/virus right? </p>
<p>&rt;    No NO NO</p>
<p>Aww baby having tantwum :( aww poor baby can’t handle a wittle fwavor in text awww so sad :(</p>
<p>&rt;    Not really, we have barred all travel outside of the Northeast without a quarantine, try to pay some attention. We haven’t quite re-annexed Maine and declared independence but soon.</p>
<p>lol you’re not stopping people from crossing state lines and people are still going wherever they want, to pretend that isn’t happening is laughable.</p>
<p>&rt;    The point is that there’s massive non-compliance and there always was going to be. Not from people that argue with you on the internet or are politically involved, but from people who honestly could give a rats ass and are living their lives. So how you come out of it saying it’s my fault, or the fault of people who call you out on how stupid the policy is, is ridiculous.</p>
<p>So if there’s non compliance.. you’re saying that people are failing their social responsibility to not travel and stay home. You’re literally proving my point lmao. </p>
<p>&rt;    “crying about my freedumbs being violated are the reason we’re in such an extended lockdown.”</p>
<p>Take it more out of context bud, you’re 2 levels up now with it. Congrats on finally understanding quotes, it’s a very simple concept but I’m sure it’s groundbreaking to you and your helper.</p>
<p>&rt;    Yes, those smaller fraction of deaths (&lt; 0.1% of Americans) probably impact the economy more like an average person dying, which considering that output is a combination of labor and capital, is well less than 0.1% of economic output, so I feel safe in saying that the drop in GDP is not directly due to the death or illness of the labor force and rather due to government policies.</p>
<p>80k deaths isn’t just some fly on the wall to the economy. </p>
<p>&rt;    Other countries that locked down did feel hard negative effects. You haven’t looked into other countries or named any specifics. You bring it up as a red herring “oh other countries did better”. If you actually want to get into the details of other countries go ahead, but this is an America-centered convo.</p>
<p>Oh but you’re gonna just continue to ignore the fact that other countries aren’t in the same shit storm we are. Did you forget how we’re a pretty big slice of all the cases and deaths in the world or something? Why can’t you compare the US to other countries? You’re comparing a fucking virus to nuclear argegedon but as soon as I do anything against your own liking that’s actually a viable comparison, now it’s not allowed lol.</p>
<p>&rt;    I mean, no u, you have no idea what you’re talking about and can’t stop name calling for the life of you</p>
<p>I would if you didn’t twist my words every single second. I would if you weren’t taking everything out of context that I say. You’re a fucking moron dude, I don’t give a shit if I’m insulting you when you don’t want to have an actual discussion and want to make shit up.</p>
<p>&rt;    ALMOST AS IF you are the idiot, huh what a world</p>
<p>I mean you implied 0.1% of the population dying would only impact the economy 0.1% yet it’s clearly evident it isn’t. You have zero backing to anything you’ve said towards the economy other than your high school education. You’re an idiot.</p>

        <p>None of us are deniers we all think the media is exaggerating thus making it a hoax. Literally nobody denies covid is real except maybe a small fringe of lunatics. The virus is real and it's really mild and not worth anyone's fear or changing one aspect of life except maybe for frequent hand washing.</p>
<p>That said they have done many things to cook the numbers from increasing deaths with nursing home infections to outright lying about numbers in multiple cases so forgive us all for being extremely skeptical</p>

        <p>UH sure thing bud. That's why I worked full time, six days a week as a massage therapist, from November 2019 all the way through to March 2020, touching people all over for an hour or more, breathing the same air with my face close to theirs while I was working on their necks and shoulders, in a poorly-ventilated room, with no masks and no other PPE, and no extra disinfection protocols, and I never got sick, and none of my clients ever got sick. I'm older and immuno-compromised, and my clients were mostly in their 50s, 60s, and 70s.</p>
<p>You're so full of fear-mongering shit lol. But keep not rousing yourself to actually think. Sorry you don't have any real experience with this like I do.</p>

        <p>Did you read the posts in this thread? Nobody is saying Covid is made up. We are saying that the media and politicians have vastly overblown its lethality. It is dangerous for a small minority, but not for the rest. The risks do not justify ripping up society. At all.</p>

        <p>By thinking covid-19 is a liberal hoax and refusing to wear a mask you actually are wishing death upon others from your ignorance. Your stupid actions have real life consequences.</p>
<p>I'm just throwing that threat back into your face because no one wants to associate with you either. </p>

A similar number has been crippled.

<p>In the last few weeks, several people in my circle tested positive but so far no significant symptoms.  I guess time will tell how it plays out for them.</p>

        <p>One is in his 40s.  The other two in their 60s. The 40 yo is the one that is good now.  The one that died was in great health and very active.  The one that is still sick was in their 60s also and not as active, maybe a little overweight.  No other issues that I know of. The one with ongoing problems seem to be related to being intubated. All three ended up with pneumonia and the 60s were both intubated.</p>

        <p>Intubation fucks you up. I have permanent problems. However I got this and was 100% fine.</p>
<p>Many viruses or our treatments for them can cause issues. It’s just how it is. This is no exception.</p>
<p>Lockdowns are evil and have nothing to do with a virus and everything to do with power.</p>

        <p>I'm glad you got better.  I dont support the lock downs either.  Like at all.  But the level of down votes my comment got sure makes one question why this sub is so reactive to anyone's experiences related to covid. I thought this sub was legit but I see its just another propaganda sub. Its a shame.</p>

        <p>People should stop downvoting you. You aren't yelling at us to #WearAFuckingMask or #StayTheFuckHome, you're sharing your story and more-or-less telling us what we already know: </p>
<ul>
<li>Older people and overweight people are at greater risk.</li>
<li>Intubation can do more harm than good.</li>
<li>Seemingly healthy people do sometimes die or experience long-term effects.</li>
</ul>
<p>People in their 60s aren't truly old yet, but they aren't young anymore either. And risk does indeed go up with age. As for the weight issue, I suspect it isn't just overweight people who are at risk, but also underweight people. This is part of why I wonder what you mean by "very" active; perhaps the one who died was somewhat underweight, and it is known that excessive exercise (such as bodybuilding or marathon running) can weaken the immune system. Maybe not so much as being sedentary, but enough to make one more susceptible to a novel respiratory virus.</p>
<p>Sorry if I seem insensitive, I'm just trying to put this in perspective.</p>

        <p>That sucks man. I do feel (yes feel as in it’s totally conjecture) that covid cases are getting more mild as people wear masks and social distance. My hypothesis is that the viral load you’re exposed to has a large impact on how severe the symptoms are. </p>

        <p>No. We have enough people blindly following what they're being told and not thinking critically. I think that is a LOT bigger problem. Everyone is selfish, and I don't trust anyone who says otherwise. True altruism doesn't exist.</p>
<p>Do you not see what's going on here? I've seen a lot of death threats and general wishings of suffering to people that have a different opinion than the hive mind does. That's absolutely terrifying and I can now understand how many of the worst atrocies in human history have been committed. It starts with this: divide and conquer, creating a common enemy and then dehumanizing them.</p>
<p>Please think for a moment. Think and reflect.</p>
