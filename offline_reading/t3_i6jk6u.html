        <p>You hear a lot about a bunch of people testing positive, but never hear the follow up. People keep freaking about the MLB cases, but most of those guys never would have known they ever had the virus if they weren't tested regularly. They're all going to return to play soon. The virus has been around long enough so that we know who the vulnerable are and that for those who aren't vulnerable it's either nothing or a chest cold. It's dumb that we're doing all this harm to our economy and society to prevent people from getting a virus that they will recover from with minimal trouble.</p>

        <p>I KNOW! And the moment one single person tests positive, we have to immediately shut down everything that person was associated with. It's going to be a never ending loop. We definitely need more sane and reasonable people like this guy.</p>

        <p>I actually think the virus might have mutated to being less deadly.  Like all these new cases (yes many are false positives) but deaths aren’t increasing rapidly. My friend his grandfather caught it in June   The man had some difficulty breathing for 2 nights, was in the hospital for 4 days and only needed oxygen. A family member of mine in his 60’s caught it (typical Greek fat smoker lol) he just had flu like symptoms for a few days and a runny nose and scratchy throat for like 10 days    Now he feels like nothing ever happened to him. Maybe if they had caught it in March they would’ve been much worse</p>

        <p>Who gives a shit about " cases "... Nobody not already dying dies from covid, and that's the truth.</p>
<p>Median death age of covid in BC is 84, 190 something death for this year in a population of 5.1 million with massive exposure to China. Covid was here in late November/early December, and up until the start of the lockdown hoax in mid March, there was absolutely nothing wrong, nothing...</p>
<p>Media said there was a plandemic, lockdown hoax started, now all of sudden it's a dangerous boogeyman. It only became a reality and " dangerous " when the media said so...</p>

        <p>I've always called them "positive test results." To me, a "case" is someone under a doctor's care. I'll even go so far as to call someone with symptoms but is recovering at home on their own a "case."</p>
<p>And from the beginning, I've wanted to know the percentages of symptomatic and asymptomatic positives. I've wanted the media to report the actual numbers, but I have a feeling that would have allowed the public to see precisely how dangerous this virus truly is/isn't.</p>

        <p>I mean it is a joke when they say "cases".  From my friends that had it, they were like here is an oxygen detector, if it goes below 95 (i believe that was the number) go to the hospital. HCQ prescribed? No. TamiFlu? No. Antibiotics? Zpack? Nope. Just stay home and then wait to get two tests to get two negatives in a row so you are not gonna give it to anyone else. If your oxygen dips, thats when you get hospitalized. Medical personnel are not even checking up on you during your quarantine. For something so "deadly", the medical response is very lax.</p>

        <p>To be fair, TamiFlu only works if you take it less than two days after symptoms appear. Most people don't seek care until they've been sick for more than three or four days, so when it's prescribed, it's to make you feel like you're being treated.</p>
