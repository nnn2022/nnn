        <p>When this thing first started last summer I knew a few people who actually caught Covid and heard through coworkers and friends about people they knew who had had it. For the past several months I have not heard of anyone I’m connected to in any way having caught Covid. These “variants” are bullshit.</p>

        <p>I had a coworker who is pro mask pro vax etc seriously shame his friend bc him and his wife knew masks didn’t work and then the wife got covid and died from complications with it. This woman who died wore a mask all day bc she was required to, poor health anyways but masks do not save lives. And the vaccine does nothing to improve t-cell immunity which seems to be a bigger issue than antibody immunity. Science died in 2020, imo.</p>

        <p>Not to mention the Delta variant is not as scary as it sounds but they keep killing people with ventilators (my friend died from forced intubation which caused a stroke and his cause of death was listed as Covid) to justify their fear campaign. Why is this all happening? I suspect because hospitals get more money the more Covid deaths they report.</p>

        <p>This is true, hospitals do get paid more for covid deaths, this is why anyone who dies within 28 days of any covid symptoms is labled a covid death. Car crashes, shark bites, gun shot wounds all been labled covid deaths in hospitals to get paid more. The article ends by saying theres no fraud discovered but thats cause they haven't been able to investigate any cases, cause the insurance companies get to write off at the end of the year and tax payers fund this chaos. </p>

        <p>People are put on ventilators as a last resort. If your friend didn’t die of that, they might have died gasping for air for a few days before it gave out entirely. 
Don’t start with “they are over using ventilators to justify their numbers” or whatever. Even if a couple of people are put on a ventilator too early, it is overwhelmingly used only as a last resort.</p>

        <p>It's called medical error. Just because a doctor chooses to place someone on a ventilator doesn't mean that person should have been placed on it and it doesn't mean that person required it as the right treatment. Early on in COVID it seemed to be the right thing to do for people they couldn't stabilize because they didn't have any effective treatments to stabilize O2 levels. Therefore the classic thought is let's help the body rest and lungs heal. However once you take that step you're really throwing a hail mary pass to help the patient. It's not conspiracy that MDs didn't want to kill this guy's friend but it's very likely their decision could have resulted in his death. There is data that indicates MDs overused ventilators early on and likely killed a lot of people. So it's very likely this dudes friend was accidentally killed due to lack of medical preparedness.</p>
<p>36% of people who get I'll or worse in a hospital after being treated is due to iatrogenic treatments, aka the MDs decisions were the direct cause of the person becoming ill.</p>

        <p>I get that. That makes sense. And I’ve agreed with that sentiment all along. 
Doctors are still doing what they think is right at the time that they prescribe a treatment. 
Same thing happened with hand washing. At the beginning, the knowledge was little to none about how the virus spread. So everyone preached hand washing to stop the spread. They were wrong, and once more information came in, they changed their stance to “it’s an airborne virus”. </p>
<p>This comment of mine was early on when this guy was implying they forced a coma and ventilators on a guy who may or may not have had covid. I was pushing back saying that his friend was out on a ventilator because he had severe symptoms and not put on a ventilator because the hospital would get more money if they killed him.</p>

        <p>Dude, that’s how they put people on ventilators! With an induced coma! You don’t vent unless you’re not conscious. Get it through your thick skull. They put anyone that was sick with Covid on vents in NYC because they thought that’s how they were supposed to treat it. Other people I know who got sick and had “trouble breathing” who were way older and unhealthier survived because they didn’t get put on a vent. They were administered supplemental oxygen.</p>

        <p>I’m not talking about “mild cases”, my friends on supplemental oxygen had severe cases. If they were vented, they would be dead. They survived thanks to better treatment protocol that doesn’t harm the body further. You’re like an NPC that can literally not acknowledge the truth in front of them because it goes against your narrative.</p>

        <p>Your friend that was on a ventilator was not a mild case. Exactly. 
The other ones were not mild cases either. Cool. 
But you can’t say they would have died on a ventilator either. That’s not how anything works. 
You can’t see alternate realities. 
Maybe in an alternate reality your friend lives. Maybe they died gasping for air. 
Maybe your other friends lived on ventilators in another reality. Maybe they got clots. Maybe some does and some lived. 
You can’t say “1 person got a clot therefore all clots for all ventilators and all deaths are because ventilators” 
Don’t be so dumb</p>

        <p>Man you have a romanticized version of what happens in the hospital. No doctor comes to see the patients. They have a protocol. Nurses come in from time to time to check and give some medicines. They don't care what happens to you unless you are someone important or have an insider. There is a symptom based treatment approach where they don't care what it is leading up to. Well, basically you have one advantage and that is you have access to oxygen. But incorrect use can lead to adverse effect and death. I am attaching a link you can check out. <a href="https://sebastianrushworth.com/2021/04/14/how-much-oxygen-is-enough/">https://sebastianrushworth.com/2021/04/14/how-much-oxygen-is-enough/</a>.  I know this because i have seen with my own eyes. And no there is no long term post covid effect that persists, because it makes no sense as we would have accumulated every side effect from any disease we have contracted from birth. Any long term effect is psychological in nature due to isolation or due to incorrect medication. My father had comorbodities, and got recommended a experimental drug by a doctor according to protocol, and fainted while going to bathroom. He got well by using ivermectin, zinc and vitamin d. Believe what you will.</p>

        <p>False logic. He got better “while taking zinc and vitamin D”. There’s no evidence to support your claim. It’s a theory you’re using. 
I can get brain cancer while riding my bike, but the two things aren’t connected because I decide they are. </p>
<p>All the stuff about doctors and nurses and symptoms makes sense. I agree, that not all protocols are great and it should be done on a case by case basis. But that’s my point: this guys friend had severe symptoms and someone determined a ventilator was needed. He’s been framing as “guy might have covid, doctors force a coma, guy dies from clot, doctors happy because covid death = more $$” 🤦‍♂️</p>

        <p>This is the dumbest argument I have ever heard. Zinc, vitamin d and vitamin c are critical components to cellular immunity, this is immunology 101. Clinical practices are developed from the basic tenants that are already known. It's not a fucking coincidence that over 75% of people in that ICU are completely vitamin D deficient. It's also a standard protocol most MDs are incorporating at this time. If you want to truly only believe the vaccine is the only tool that can help people then you're actually not really open minded at all. If you want to parrot the continual there is "no proof argument, there are no good studies" then you don't understand the scientific process in general. There are multiple ways to skin a cat and just because the professor tells you there is only way in the classroom doesn't make it true unless there is a sharing of information and collaboration to prove or refuse that statement. If it is refuted then each time someone brings up another way it has to be again refuted to not work. Not just dismissed after one discussion. </p>
<p>There are so many doctors out there who were top of their fields bringing excellent clinical data on treatments but they are immediately dismissed as heretics just because they don't have the means to conduct big controlled trials like big pocket book big pharma.</p>

        <p>You’re putting words in my mouth. I said there’s no proof based on this story. </p>
<p>Vitamins and zinc can help you get better. Sure. No argument there. 
But you can’t say he got better because of those things. 
The guy was on an experimental drug, fainted, then (presumably they took him off the drug) took ivermectin, zinc, and vitamin D, and got better. But maybe he was going to get better on his own. Maybe it sped it up. Maybe it was the experimental drug (that made him faint). 
If I get sick, take ginkgo baloba and get better, it wasn’t necessarily the ginkgo that did it.
I’m just saying Zinc and vitamin D aren’t cures. That’s all. Chill out.</p>

        <p>You use false logic on your whole story. 
Your friend died with ventilator. 
Maybe he would have died without it. 
You DONT KNOW. </p>
<p>The problem with science and medicine is there is no light indicator that turns red when a ventilator is needed. 
Someone made a judgement call. And maybe they fucked up. But maybe that person was going to die if they didn’t get any fucking oxygen. Just because other people lived while not on ventilators doesn’t mean your friend would have lived 10000%. That’s false logic. 
A friend falls off his bike and dies wearing a helmet. 5 others live with no helmet. Therefore all helmets bad. Lawyered. 
That’s how you sound. </p>
<p>If NY made plenty of bad judgement calls, and people died as a result, they certainly didn’t do it because the fucking hospital would get more funding.</p>

        <p>And heart disease is a leading cause of death. Water is wet. 
What’s your point?
My point that you refuse to acknowledge is that you don’t know your friend would have survived either way. 
Maybe he would have died and you’d be here crying “they did nothing to save my boi. Doctors are bad.”
Maybe if he wore a mask he would have lived. Maybe if he didn’t have a Christmas party with his friends or family he would not have gotten sick. 
Maybe not. We don’t know. That’s my point. 
Malpractice is bad. That’s why it sucks being a doctor. If you fucked up, people say malpractice. 
If you do everything by the book, maybe they still die. </p>
<p>Also you claimed they did it for insurance or hospital funding so get the fuck outta here with that bullshit sob story now. Don’t try to high road me with “malpractice is bad” bullshit.</p>

        <p>It’s not as innocuous as a breathing tube, it’s an extremely invasive procedure that goes down into your lungs and forces them open and closed while inducing a coma. It’s why the survival rate is so low. It does a ton of damage to the body. Look it up yourself. It’s a completely unnecessary procedure. Non invasive administration of oxygen, antivirals, and vitamin C IV is a way better solution.</p>

        <p>All the vaccines have been absolutely shown to have microscopic blood clots they cause. And the vaccine has absolutely been proven to have a protein shed, those proteins also cause clots. People are dropping like flies from strokes, heart issues and clots, they aren’t reporting adverse effects, because people wouldn’t get the shot if they knew the many side effects that can happen months and years later. The receptors in children, for example, only exist in the heart, that is why heart issues for children who receive the vaccine. I have no issues with vaccines, but informed consent is being denied. All the people who have received the vaccine, are the first to have a CRISPR designed vaccine. Clinical trials on humans were never done. And animals tested were found to have died due to vaccine dependency. </p>
<p>Go google CRISPR and look at the labs that sell knock in, knock out therapy. It isn’t censored. It’s their own research. Science is defined by the “Scientific method”. Read the definition. If the good and bad are not researched, we remain in the dark ages of science. How do you get breakthroughs if everything is settled? You can’t. I am all for scientists to question, they should, it’s actually their job. </p>
<p>Researchers in corporate facilities are only driven for deadlines and to produce to please their products. They often ignore anything that would compete with their findings. That isn’t science. It’s like someone saying the earth is flat, and refuting actual science data that determines it is spherical. But, even as misguided as flat earth may be, questions regarding the earth, gives way for more information as to why, the earth is spherical. New discovery is always a good side to criticism. That’s the long answer to your question.</p>
<p>I grew up with amazing people from MIT and Cal Tech, all trying to disprove their own theories, and it was amazing to see the small pieces together because there wasn’t a corporate board pushing what they wanted, rather than what the science actually said.</p>

        <p>You don’t induce a coma on a patient with a cough and a fever. You do it because there was no alternative. Stop lying. Your friend died while being treated to the best of their abilities. To imply someone killed him for hospital numbers and funding is lying, stupid, wrong, and harmful 
I don’t even need to know the details of your friends sickness to know you’re wrong. 
You’re not much of a friend if you sit here and lie so blatantly about it. 
Or maybe you’re just ignorant and you actually believe it. Which is more of an indictment on the American education system.</p>

        <p>No, the virus is actually limited to the respiratory system.  What the fuck kind of bullshit are you spinning with the weakend immune system shit?  Your immune system is not weakened or shut down by a respiratory virus, that would be AIDS... and that hypothesis you concocted wouldnt explain increased clotting since the immune cascade has nothing to do with clotting factors.  I'm not a doctor, but I do habe a degree in pharmacy and 10 years of experience in practice including in the hospital setting.  Everything you said is an uneducated and illogical fabrication.  As far as how could a respirator cause a clot the answer is simple, trauma.  The ventilator tube damages on the way down, this is a fact, then bleeding leads to clotting and clotting can dislodge and move through circulation to the brain where it clogs in the small capillaries.  You can also force bacteria into the vascular system causing growth and inflammatory vascular damage, like what you see in endocarditis, that can send clots downstream.  This is why you need antibiotics during dental procedures because simple trauma to the gums can lead to death through this mechanism.</p>

        <p>Deaths are one of the things you should look at. But people who get sick and recover will live for years maybe a whole life with symptoms. Severe lung, heart, circulatory, and cognitive damage have been happening all around the world for those who “survive” this illness. 
Don’t be stupid. 
Even someone who didn’t DIE might have come within an inch of their lives. Once someone can’t breathe anymore they are put on a ventilator. At that point they have a 50% chance of dying. 
Imagine for a second that was you. Knowing that you had a 50% chance of dying. Most of those people come out with all the damage I just mentioned and a whole bunch of PTSD.</p>

        <p>I don't know. Of the few people I know who had Covid, one died, two were in ICU and are recovering slowly, one is STILL regaining their strength and lung capacity (almost a year afterward), and three had no long term side effects. These were all healthy, young people. The oldest was in their 50s.</p>

        <p>I also think it's telling that there isn't a definitive list of what the symptoms of "long covid" are. Seems to be all over the map. </p>
<p>I have PTSD from the past year, too. I watched my severely autistic child regress in all areas of her life since having our world shut down over the past year. If you think it's "stupid" to be concerned about that, I don't know what to tell you.</p>

        <p>I appreciate that you don't dismiss the effects of lock down on the population at large.</p>
<p>But it's not a separate argument - it's actually the crux of the issue. Let's say "long covid" is very much a real thing, and some people are truly suffering from long-term effects of the virus. Does the end justify the means?  (The "means" being indefinite mandatory masking/future lock downs, and the "end" meaning less people suffer from "long covid.")</p>
<p>In my opinion it does not. </p>
<p>This is a very personal issue for me as my child has been denied access to in-person education and therapies because she is literally unable to wear a mask. Has a huge meltdown if the mask gets within 2 feet of her face, tears and snot everywhere, won't even let me get it around her ears. Believe me, I have tried. LAUSD doesn't care though - they aren't letting ANY children who can't wear masks on campus. They say "online learning" is an appropriate accommodation for her. They actually claim that learning through Zoom is an appropriate accommodation for a nonverbal autistic 5-year-old (and many other children like her). She is still not eligible to attend school for the 2021-2022 school year, necessitating us to move out of state ASAP so that she can get back in school after being denied an education for one and a half years.</p>
<p>It's not just LAUSD doing this though, I have had problems just trying to go out and live my life with a maskless child here in LA for the past 1.5 years. No one seems to care that there are children and adults with VERY legitimate reasons for not wearing masks. No one is considering the people who suffer from debilitating anxiety/depression/PTSD/disabilities that mask wearing harms. The amount of hate and vitriol I have seen towards people that have VERY LEGITIMATE reasons for not wearing masks is FRIGHTENING. A very scary narrative is being set right now, especially in Los Angeles. People who can't/don't wear masks are being harassed and dehumanized.  Do you think that's OK? I sure don't. I think that anyone who doesn't feel comfortable wearing a mask should be allowed to assess that risk for themselves and act accordingly - we don't need the government telling us what to do.</p>
<p>Another reason mandatory masking doesn't make sense is because most masks don't even stop the spread. Everyone needs to be wearing N-95's for this to MAYBE actually stop the spread. It's security theater, at best. People are still going to be getting covid and potentially suffer from "long covid" all the same if everyone isn't wearing N-95's. What is the point?</p>
<p>Common sense says that people should be allowed to decide for themselves how they want to proceed with masking/quarantining (and vaccinating, too... I believe in the concepts of bodily autonomy and consent). We've been living with this virus for almost 2 years now. We don't need government mandates telling us how to live our lives at this point. It is harming more people than it's helping.</p>

        <p>Ok your daughter can’t wear a mask. Fine. I get that it’s frustrating. 
But it’s literally the people in this chat that are at fault. 
Fighting these orders the whole way, fighting the mask mandate the whole way, and not getting vaccinated are the reasons why the virus persists. 
If your daughter has legit reasons then I feel sorry for her. No one should be persecuted. But it be your own people. Many people DON’T have legit reasons to not wear it. 
Be they sovereign citizens, Qanon supporters, trump supporters, people screaming about freedom, or pretending to have a medical reason so they can film a Walmart employee trying to force them to wear a mask for their Tiktok video. There are tons of people here in this subreddit that are doing the most to not have to do the least (mask wearing)</p>
<p>Yes I agree non-N95 isn’t ideal. 
But it’s better than nothing. 
Surgical masks help a lot. Cloth masks help others because you breathe your own crap into it. But it does little to nothing for self protection. 
But all that is MAGNITUDES better than no mask at all.</p>

Cause you have a big heart and want to save the world from a illness, do what a corrupt government tells you, that always worked in history. I bet you'll go a couple more months till your sick of this government control shit. You'll be 6 booster shots in and still be scared 😆. At some point you'll come around, government never gives up power just obtains more.

        <p>Lmao you guys would be a million plus deaths by now with Donald Drumph. </p>
<p>I also never said don’t go anywhere ever. 
You guys lose an argument, and refuse to acknowledge so you switch directions. That’s how I know I won. 
I said wear a damn mask when cases are surging. It’s not a problem. It’s not the same as slavery and nazi Germany. It’s just a mask. 
I go out, wear a mask, shop, and come home. If I hang out with friends, it’s outside. Not a big deal for me. I’m doing my part.

        <p>Says live with the knowledge then ignores the fact fauci said mask don't protect and its all optics and control (read his e-mails). Mask don't do much but hey wear one if you want but don't judge or start a scene when people exercise their freedom not to. Mind your business and stop forcing others into your madness. You got a mask and a vaccine, great your safe so stop worrying about others that you perceive as "dumb" just for being American and having a freedom they can use. Respect people got choices, so don't cry when they don't choice your way. Live with that knowledge.</p>

        <p>You are misconstruing Fauci and most likely heard from AON like everyone else here. 
At the beginning they said masks weren’t effective because they weren’t n95 masks and they needed to keep supply for those who NEEDED masks. 
If he said those things at the beginning, he doesn’t think that now. Scientists are allowed to change their suggestions based on current up to date knowledge. We now know that masks are effective (to varying degrees). </p>
<p>And telling me to leave it alone isn’t the whole story. The more you deny vaccines, and continue to spread the virus, the more it mutates. It’s selfish and people like this subreddit should be ashamed. But they won’t.</p>

        <p>I said vaccines don’t prevent transmission and you’re fearmongering that the unvaccinated are causing mutations. Vaccinated are just as likely to, but it’s irrelevant since the Delta strain isn’t as lethal. As outlined in virology textbooks that corona viruses get less lethal over time.</p>

But I guess your right, covid will destroy the planet, by 2025 the population will be 0 cause everyone will die, so wear 25 mask and get 10 vaccines while your lockdown to save the 1%. You people have no hope, keep spreading doom and gloom, wait till you hear about heart disease you'll be shocked at the death rate there. Covid is not something to be  fearing, hospitals fudge the numbers of cases for reimbursements. Its not the end of the world!!!</p>

<p>Not all masks are the same. 
But the virus is NOT too small to get caught in a mask. 
Especially since masks have overlapping and a mesh of fibres that catch some or most (depending on mask type) virus particles. 
Just because you can’t see it doesn’t mean it’s too small for a mask.</p>

        <p>Wrong. Most common way is airborne. </p>
<p>Wrong. Everything mutates to make errors. But if they replicate enough, those errors can actually be accidental improvements. 
This current virus is already evolving to elude detection, to be more easily transmissible, etc. 
You’re reading the wrong books. Because the current situation is very different than what you think you know. You’ve clearly never read a virology text book so don’t even pretend. Jesus.</p>

Maybe it doesn't matter if you wear a mask or not, because it'll burn through the population irregardless of protocols until everyone achieves herd immunity.

        <p>Ok I’m sorry I can’t read this whole thing now because I’m busy. Im not dismissing your concerns at all. 
But this is my point: it literally is not the issue here. 
This is all starting with wearing a mask. Not quarantine, not stay at homes. Nothing else. 
If you wear a mask, you’re allowed to go anywhere, so people should suck it up and do it. </p>
<p>The problem with all this is people cry about these quarantines, mask orders, and getting the vaccine. But if they just did those things, we wouldn’t still be dealing with this 2 years later. 
Pushing back, refusing, and literally going against orders means the virus lives longer, mutates, and becomes more efficient. Now we have variants. Now we have 2nd, 3rd, 4th wave. </p>
<p>People cry that the vaccine doesn’t work, but won’t get it, and then laugh that Biden can’t get enough people to get the vaccine, and then laugh about variants because it’s fake. But these people are selfish and are the reason the virus is opportunistically mutating.</p>

        <p>The concern is around where the curve goes from here - for example, look back at November and cover up the rest of the graph to the right. Doesn't look too bad right? Just a little spike. Now slowly uncover the chart again. That's what we don't want to happen again and we can't always know where it'll go, and these precautions help reduce the chance of it spiking high again.</p>

        <p>These restrictions are being 100% fueled by political cowardice. It's as simple as that. No politician in any jurisdiction anywhere wants to make a hard decision and bear accountability for the result -- despite that being the job they were elected to do. </p>
<p>It's easy to defer to doctors in white lab coats, who only have to worry about one factor (the health system). Elected officials exist to weigh a balance of all factors, including health, economic, rights and so on. I'm so sick of these people just abandoning their responsibility.</p>

        <p>Honestly, it's why I don't tend to see someone like Fauci as the villain in most cases. Don't get me wrong -- I think bureaucrats in charge of our health responses have lots of explaining to do before they deserve our trust again. But he's just one part of a very big system, and medical professionals like him were thrust into a position of leadership they never should have been put in.</p>
<p>If you're an elected official, your job is to make decisions and be accountable, not to pass that accountability along to scientists who aren't possibly equipped to handle the demands of governing. This is job you sign up for as a politician. You make a call, and if it's wrong, you get held accountable.</p>

        <p>Listening and taking advice -- absolutely. They should do that. But the advice from the medicinal community is purely focused on mitigating certain kinds of risk at the expense of every other consideration. Doctors aren't experts on the economic effects of lockdowns. Doctors aren't experts on the constitutional considerations and freedom of movement rights that are impacted by vaccine passports. </p>
<p>That's why we elect leaders: to listen to all kinds of expert advice and find the right balance. Doesn't feel like that has been the approach in some jurisdictions though.</p>

        <p>Check out the recent case numbers from UK and Netherlands. It's probably the first time we see actual exponential growth in a very short time. However, the death rates are so low it's indistinguishable from the baseline and noise.</p>
<p>The "delta variant", or whatever is this week's hyped term, is nothing but a mild cold which is used as an excuse to prolong the tyranny.</p>
<p>And of course, the cold and flu come and go many times a year, every year. That's normal. Power grabs like we've seen the last year tend to stick around. I fear this will last a long time, or till it gets an abrupt end.</p>

        <p>Masks kept cases down. Fact. 
Masks only work if people use them. There are too many ignorant deniers for them to work properly. 
Also they won’t bring cases down, that’s not how they work. But they slow the curve. 
If everyone used masks, and then everyone got vaccinated, we could have some indoor non-mask wearing fun. But we can’t have nice things because there are too many people crying about their precious freedums</p>

        <p><em>“…continued to increase”</em>
It’s not like masks are a cure. They’re not a cure-all fix-all solution. They are meant to help slow the spread. 
Even if they are used 100% of times in stores, and they are n95 masks (which they weren’t and aren’t), there are still many many many other ways to spread the virus. 
Do you honestly believe 100% of people were 100% compliant on lockdown procedures? Did NO ONE ever visit anyone? Not one person?</p>
<p>Think about it. If everyone wore masks all the time and got vaccinated we’d be fine. 
But if everyone wore masks all the time and no vaccine, we’d still get cases because you can still get the virus while wearing a mask. It’s not 100% fool proof. But it’s magnitudes better than no masks for anyone.</p>

        <p>But you see my point though? It’s not a cure. Don’t act like that’s the only thing that matters. 
Now moving on. 
The point is to absolutely stop more people getting sick. 
If wearing masks stops 100,000 more people from getting sick, we should try when cases are going up.<br>
What if it was your friend, or family that got it? There’s no way to say “well masks on person X would have saved them” but maybe it would. Why not try and save as many as possible? 
And hospitals absolutely were overextended. Don’t start that lie. It wasn’t 100% of hospitals were 30% overextended. Some were over. Some were under. Some would certainly have been over if mask mandates and stay-at-home orders weren’t used.</p>

It's never going away you moron and you being convinced that you have to be a good boy, wear your mask, stay inside, get a vaccine. You're an NPC. You think you're kind hearted and helping humanity but you're living a miserable existence and it's apparent by how many people you're arguing with on the internet. COVID was the best thing that ever happened to you. You probably went from a no body to telling everyone what they need to do. You love authoritarian type things because you're a weak person parroting yourself as someone who cares about humanity yet you can't consider anything outside your own perspective. You can deny this but it's so obvious the type of person you are. Mocking freedom as if that's some stupid trivial thing. Are you a moron? Freedom is the only principle in life worth dying for and that's been proven throughout human history. The only reason you mock it is because you live in a period of time with the greatest comfort and prosperity. When the chips fall you'll be the first selfish coward stabbing someone in the back.</p>

        <p>LMAO this guys full red pissed now. 
We’re all selfish in our own ways. 
I don’t mock freedom. I mock American ideals of freedom because you act like wearing a mask is the same as slavery. It’s hilarious and sad at the same time. 
I actually don’t know a single person friend or family who got covid. So don’t even start with that. I maybe know 3 people who know someone who got it. 
That’s because where we live, we take it seriously. The pockets of freedum fighters still exist, and anti vaxxers still exist. But those are the ones ending up in the hospital now. Thankfully everyone I care about is vaccinated and we don’t cry about wearing masks for a few minutes while buying groceries. 
Go cry into your freedum fries and enjoy going bankrupt when you get to the hospital. 🤣</p>

        <p>Funny because some of us considered the cure to be worse than the solution and it's no wonder you're still so concerned by COVID. I've treated COVID in the hospital, my parents had it, my friends have had it. I've always taken precautions when it came to COVID just like anything else. What country do you live in? Your vitriol for Americans is apparent but why the fuck would you care how our country handles things when it sounds like you love in a country where you can't shit on a toilet without a mask. America is the only country in this pandemic that hasn't been completely controlled by it's government. Our government can't just start passing laws like Canada that make no fucking sense. </p>
<p>For instance why does someone have to wear a mask if they are vaccinated? Like what is the actual reason? Please enlighten me because if that's the case you are basically saying that the vaccine doesn't do shit. I live in a state where I haven't worn a mask in 4 months and there isn't any outbreak here.</p>

        <p>First of all your country has had over 600000 deaths to covid. So don’t act all high and mighty. </p>
<p>Second if you actually care to learn, here’s what it is. 
If 100% of the people in your country are vaccinated fully. You would still have some virus coming in. Why? Who knows? Travel by employees, diplomats, senators fleeing the country, etc. 
Other than that that, I can’t think off the top of my head. But if 100% of the people were vaccinated and NO ONE got in or left (then returned) then you would probably be safe. 
But that will never happen, they will never get 100% vaccinated because people are stubborn/afraid/medical reasons. 
They will never stop travel. </p>
<p>NOW, once that gets through your head, wrap your brain around this: vaccination doesn’t mean 100% protection. 
So now that travel happens, people aren’t vaccinated, people hold parties/get togethers, sports events, rallies, and people HATE wearing masks, can you now see how there is still the chance of getting the virus?
Everyone is different. Everyone reacts different to the vaccine. Some might be 80% some 96% some 50%. There’s no LCD display telling us our protection level.</p>

        <p>I’m not comparing countries in what I just wrote. 
Nothing but facts. 
Vaccines don’t offer 100% protection. And while that will always remain the same throughout the world, one thing is also true: we can’t control the flow of people like China. 
It’s almost like you didn’t bother reading my explanation. 
If the point you’re trying (and failing) to make, is that we can’t control things so why bother? That’s probably why you voted for trump. 
He did nothing to help and the virus ravaged your whole country. Laughing stock of the world.</p>

        <p>When we can get case numbers, deaths, and transmissions down to a safe level, then sure. Go ahead and remove orders. 
If there are new variants that are more transmissible, and they are in your area, and the government determines you should wear a mask, then wear a damn mask. It’s not that hard. It’s not that bad. 
If everyone followed mask orders, quarantine, and got vaccinated ASAP, there wouldn’t be as much lingering virus, it wouldn’t be mutating as fast, and we could go back to normal some times. When it flares back up, go back to masks and staying cautious.</p>

        <p>Listen, I don’t have numbers. I am not paid to make those decisions. I didn’t refuse anything. I have you an answer. 
As I’ve mentioned before, science is not a black/white, yes/no, quarantine/safe type of thing. 
Everyone makes judgement based on different factors. Factors like, population density, population vaccinated, hospital rooms, hospital staff availability, amount of travel within states/countries for residents, etc etc. 
And I’m not saying whoever makes those decisions is going to be right 100% of the time. 
But you guys gotta get it through your heads that it’s not pass/fail. It’s fluid, and things change. Roll with it.</p>

        <p>So many factors because there’s no stamp that says it works for everyone if you do X. 
Flu kills people every year, sure. You know what? We should be more open to wearing masks in fucking flu season anyways. It was stupid having everyone in offices in flu season with no precautions. 
But covid is airborne and covid doesn’t have a fucking season. And covid is mutating because people are dragging bass on doing the right thing and impoverished countries aren’t vaccinated which creates cesspools of mutations as well.</p>

        <p>Listen. Basic evolutionary biology (soon to be outlawed in your poor country) says that ERRORs are literally the only way things have evolved over time. 
Without errors there is no evolution. So by admitting to evolution, you admit that errors lead to improvements.
Some errors are kept because it isn’t lethal. 
Baldness is an evolutionary error. It persists because even bald guys fuck. 
If we were animals with no hospitals, medicine, and social network, maybe Down syndrome would die off. Maybe it would exist in isolated pockets. </p>

        <p>Doesn’t matter if he thought there was a giant space turtle who shits out new evolutionary species. 
We KNOW what evolution is. It’s the passing on of genetic traits. Some of those traits are combined from parents. Some mistakes are made in the process and some of those are lethal, some are silent, some are beneficial. 
I wouldn’t expect you to understand. Because you are trying real hard here and still falling well short.</p>

        <p>I’ve literally explained to you over and over the features of viruses and the reasons why coronaviruses do NOT mutate to become more lethal. The only reason this virus is lethal at all is because they tinkered with the furin cleavage site to have affinity for human ACE-2 receptors. Had they left the virus alone in the caves in Yunnan, we wouldn’t be here right now.</p>

        <p>It doesn’t matter. 
He can be wrong how it happens, but the general principles of passing on mutations is what his legacy is and that is the basis of evolutionary biology. 
I don’t give a shit about goo or racist assumptions. Evolution happens whether or not your tiny smooth brain understands it or not.</p>

        <p>bravo to you come to this sub an talk shit like this. you're either really committed to those fucking masks, or you're hella dumb. Actually, probably both. The masks don't do shit. They don't form a seal. They don't have a filter fine enough to capture viruses. When people at the labs are working on these viruses, they are in full SCBA suits. Why is that? I got covid wearing a mask. They are not worth the trouble. We are not performing surgery out there. We just need normal life with a modicum of common sense applied to viruses like this.</p>

        <p>That’s not how this works. I’ve been over this so many times today. 
But masks work. No one ever claimed they work 100%. 
Some masks work better than others. You got sick wearing one. Was it a surgical mask? Cloth mask? N95? Or just a scarf on your face? 
The virus gets caught in the mesh of fibres in the mask. It’s not a perfect square bunch of holes that any virus can get through. 
I get that we aren’t doing surgery, but wearing a mask is still magnitudes better than everyone walking around coughing, breathing, shouting, and laughing indoors without them. 
You can still get wet wearing a rain jacket. But you wear it for protection nonetheless. Only in this example, you might die. Or others close to you, or a stranger might die because you chose to “fight oppressive masks” 
Sure. Do that. That’s not selfish at all.</p>

        <p>what does it matter what mask I wore when it seems any old thing will do to pass scrutiny of the mask mandates? Don't you see how unaware of yourself you are? What good is a mask mandate when people wear all the different things you mentioned? If someone coughs under an n95 mask, the virus is still getting out. If this were a real concern, then lockdowns would be in order and the only real way to stop a pandemic spread. To run around saying masks save grandma's life is ridiculous.</p>

        <p>Masks have worked for longer than that. Even wearing a scarf around your face is better than nothing. 
You protect and catch outgoing virus particles.
Some masks more than others. But still not 100% 
But if it’s 10, 20,30,40,80% ? I don’t know that anyone knows that. But we do know it’s better than not wearing anything.</p>

        <p>Masks kept cases down? Where were you last winter? Masks didn’t seem to do shit then. Yet at the same time, you lot insisted they kept the flu at bay. So which is it? Are people wearing them or not?</p>

        <p>“Seem” not to work. Great analysis. 
Masks work to some degree. 
So does social distancing. 
None are a cure. 
None are 100%
But cases would have been worse with NO masks. That’s a fact. </p>
<p>There are other factors involved. 
How many people ACTUALLY wore masks. Just because it’s mandated doesn’t mean people listen?
How many people were just living a normal social life or having meetups occasionally without masks in person? 
If people live a normal life but wear a mask once a week to go to the store it’s not really going to fix it.</p>

        <p>Yes that America there's aspects I enjoy but overall we can do better. </p>
<p>Healthcare for instance, I believe its morally wrong for people (insurance companies) to make money off people's suffering. </p>
<p>Education by and large we are lagging behind most other developing nations, I think we need to invest a lot more in better public options, I also think we should push for Trade skills to be more of a valid option. All I heard when I was in school was how important at least having a Bachelors Degree was required to be successful. </p>
<p>Congrats you are in a nice clean city but we have a serious mental health issue and poverty issue that's leading to a ton of homelessness that can be addressed but that leads to higher crimes and homeless encampments getting settled in pockets around cities.</p>

        <p>Listen, it all started with some ass hat claiming his friend died because hospitals want more money. That’s wrong. 
I tried to educate all the “open minded” people (laughable) about how wrong that is. 
I’ve agreed with a few points on here already. You just choose to cherry pick the ones where I don’t. 
I conceded that doctors shouldn’t have used ventilators as much, I agreed that people shouldn’t be persecuted for not wearing a mask if they had a reason. But said reason shouldn’t be “I need muh freedums” and “said goodbye to grandma”. 
Please. You’re not arguing in good faith and neither is the rest of this whole retched infected subreddit.</p>

        <p>Lmao this guy just said masks don’t work. Plenty of your own people on this subreddit just claimed masks work. 
Not ALL masks work. And NO MASK works 100%. </p>
<p>Here’s a visual guide since I’m not sure you can read or understand the nuance of wearing a mask vs effectiveness. </p>

        <p>Fauci said himself that paper and cloth masks don’t work. N95’s do work because they capture the virus thanks to the static the material generates, but the virus will still be able to get inside the eyes (which is the most common form of transmission).</p>

I learned all about evolution, DNA replication and plenty more. 
And even with all your knowledge you claim, you’re still so wrong about evolution. Why is that? Maybe you need MORE googling. Or read at least one textbook.</p>

        <p>If you zoom in on the past 30 days you can see that the cases are rising exponentially and are currently at 1500/day with a doubling time of about one week. Without intervention that will likely be 3k per day next week, 6k the following week etc. Not good. </p>

        <p>I guess where getting our information from different sources? I was always under the impression that masks and social distancing <em>slow</em> the spread of the virus. I’m not sure I’ve seen the claim that they <em>prevent</em> the spread or that they would <em>eliminate</em> it. You seem to be saying BC they don’t prevent the spread they don’t work?</p>

        <p>I agree. Cases exponentially rise when a virus mutates into a more contagious variant.</p>
<p>The thing is, when a virus mutates to be more contagious, it is also less lethal.</p>
<p>I don't give a fuck if every person on earth gets covid tomorrow if all they get is a sore throat and sniffles. The vaccines were never even meant to stop the spread, just to make people who catch it able to fight it better.</p>
<p>Regardless of which side of the fence you're on for vaccine, cases shouldn't be the black and white factor.</p>

        <p>I’m not saying it was all staged, but more media hype —&rt; more people thinking they need to get tested, more tests being pushed —&rt; more “cases”. The total number of cases is completely artificial and can be manipulated or interpreted however you want.</p>

        <p>There is certainly a narrative to be painted with having cases rise for the last few months Trump is in office and drop drastically once Biden is in. We could go in circles guessing why but all I was saying was they won’t get that high again.</p>

        <p>Note, all spikes have to start somewhere. It's in the best interest of the medical system to prevent ahead of time than to let things escalate.</p>
<p>Also I don't know how it doesn't seem immediatley disingenuous to talk about a spike that strictly speaking isn't over yet. He could have tweeted the same thing about the last big spike on the day when the same numbers of cases were observed as today, ex somewhere in the middle of october.</p>

        <p>Fair points to consider. </p>
<p>On the negative: dehumanizing, harder to breathe, can't see smile. </p>
<p>On the positive: might protect you from dying from Covid, might help reduce the spread of Covid to others, might reduce the number of times Covid mutates to a more virulent strain.</p>
<p>I'm fully vaxxed. I've been maskless for weeks now. However I just flew and had to go back to wearing a mask for the whole flight. I got to thinking, this sucks. BUT, come on. Its nothing. When you consider the potential benefits, there is no arguing - its such a small ask that to complain about it makes one look very small.</p>

        <p>thats is provably false as there are countries with very limited or even no measure at all and they did just as fine as anyone else.  </p>
<p>you can compare US states with different mandates with each others and I promise you that you will not be able tell which had stricter rules.</p>

        <p>People didn't die because of covid. People died, and are dieing because of politics. After a year of "deadly pandemic", when testing positive, people are sent home to do nothing, having a virus festering upon need of hospitalisation. All this while covid can be easily treated when early medication is applied... medication prohibited in Western countries. 85% of covid deaths could have been prevented with theuse of ivermectin alone.</p>
<p>You're the denying asshole here. If you want to condonoe the prohibition of earlt treatment medication, then you're the one condoning all those deaths you speak of. If you want to be on team gestapo, it's on you, idiot.</p>
