<p>Here is a <a href="https://ababilling88.wixsite.com/8lovewins8/home/vaers-reports/vaers-rpt-20210122">LINK</a> to the dashboard the creator of the video is using, if you want to check it by yourselves.</p>
<p>If you don't trust the dashboard, here is a link to a very easy <a href="https://youtu.be/G-IVlMNYNT0">Video Tutorial</a> of how to use the VAERS WONDER system if you want to check it directly from their website.</p>
<p>Here is a link to an <a href="https://thevaccinereaction.org/2020/01/only-one-percent-of-vaccine-reactions-reported-to-vaers/">Article</a> which details why the VAERS system reports <strong>only 1% of the REAL CASES</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>PD: I post it here in</strong> r/NoNewNormal<strong>, the best subreddit of them all, because I'm sure they wouldn't allow this in shill gatekeeping subreddits like</strong> r/LockdownSkepticism<strong>, as they only replicate mainstream media articles.</strong></p></p>
