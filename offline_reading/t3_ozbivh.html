    <strong>r/rant tries to equate 'Freedom of Speech' with 'Hate Speech'</strong>
    <p><p>It's right in their description:</p>
<p>&rt;***This is an <strong><em>anti-free speech</em></strong>, pro LGBT community that supports Black Lives Matter. If you don't like it, post somewhere else.*** What does this mean, you ask. It means: Nazis, Bigots, Racists, Trolls will be banned &amp; punted to the Admins.</p>
<p>Clearly  the implication is that Free Speech is something Nazis, Bigots and Racists use.    Apparently it's one of the tools of the fascist right wingers.</p>
<p>I cannot begin to express how completely bizarre and twisted this is.   It is an absolute inversion of the truth.    </p>
<p>Martin Luther King Jr.,  bless his soul, fought for the right to speak against a tide of adversity.   Without freedom of speech, some of the most important things every spoken in public would have never been heard. </p>
<p>Whoever the people are that moderate r/rant they need to address this sickening piece of hypocrisy that they are trying to wedge into the reddit community.</p>
<p>Freedom of Speech is not Hate Speech.  It is a God given right of EVERY human on  this planet and we must FIGHT to preserve it at all costs.</p></p>
