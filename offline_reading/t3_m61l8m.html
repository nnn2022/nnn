    <strong>Finally getting back to the Gym after months!</strong>
    <p><p>Hello NNN! I'm going back to gymming this weekend, however I am worried about the possibility of being forced to wear a mask. I go to a gym chain (not small business) in one of the most pro mask states in the U.S. I also work with a trainer which may increase the possibility that they won't let me work out without one. </p>
<p>Does anyone know how strict gyms are in this situation? Has anyone been kicked out of a gym for noncompliance? I have an obvious disability, will I be able to use that to my advantage?</p>
<p>Side note: I've been going to stores by myself maskless with no issues.</p></p>

        <p>Best bet is to get some sort of trial. Test the waters at multiple gyms and see what you can get away with. Some staff will care others won’t. If your state is pro mask then you will definitely not get away with going maskless unless u plan on getting kicked out or arrested. But then again if you’re getting away in stores without a mask then I’d say your state is relatively relaxed. </p>
<p>My gym is definitely enforcing masks but they give leeway for cardio but it’s a good sized gym where there’s maybe 5-10 people max at all times. They just care that you wipe everything down and sanitize which I’m all for.</p>

        <p>I suspect that I haven't been bothered going to stores because of my disability; my friend has been kicked out of some of the same places for noncompliance.</p>
<p>I'm somewhat optimistic because I heard in another location nearby that everyone just wears a mask on their chin (but that could be just with cardio machines). Also my gym has probably around the same amount of people as yours.</p>
<p>How has your gym experience been? I mostly use bands, boxes and wall/floor equipment so I'm worried I'll have to wear a mask for an entire workout.</p>
