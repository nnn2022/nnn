    <strong>Can someone explain to me the argument “The media’s got us living in fear”?</strong>
    <p><p>Can someone explain to me the argument “The media’s got us living in fear”?</p>
<p>Out of all the Anti-SocialDistancing/Anti-Mask arguments, this is the one that confuses me the most. I don’t understand the premise of the argument. Is the media not allowed to report on scary things? Where do you get the idea that all fear is wrong? Everybody fears! Sure, it’s not healthy to constantly worry about the future. However, it’s completely fine to have fear in general. Even Anti-Lockdown people act upon their fears. They fear Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci are going to inject them with microchips that will track them. Because of fear, we invent things like seat belts, bicycle helmets, etc. Fear can be used for a lot of good things. Imagine this scenario. Let’s say it was a busy day at the beach. Everybody is in the ocean surfing and swimming. The lifeguard sees a shark and tells everybody to get out of the water. The people reply “Stupid lifeguard! Your trying to get us living in fear!” And they continue to surf and swim until the shark eats them alive. Who’s at fault in that situation? The lifeguard for “pushing fear” or the surfers for not acting on their fears? Again, are there people who are too afraid of COVID? Absolutely! But I know an Anti-Masker who told me to my face that I’m living in fear because I wear a mask. I told him that I’m not living in fear and that I’m just following the rules of the store. He then told me “Yes you are! It’s ok! Take a deep breath! Everything’s gonna be alright! There’s no such thing as COVID! Stop living in fear!” I literally showed no signs of fear. I wore a mask like everybody, and he treated me like I was having a panic attack. He speaks for me and tells me what I’m feeling. That drives me insane! Anyhow. I’m not even saying that the arguments invalid, I just don’t understand it. I hope you guys understand.</p></p>

        <p>A washington examiner poll in July found that americans believed 40% of the country had coronavirus and 9% had died. If that doesn't completely destroy your extremely weak and pitiful argument, I don't know what will. Yes, fear exists, no shit. Fear mongering also exists, where dangers are consistently overexaggerated to give people a false perception of the danger they are in.</p>

        <p>The main difference is the lifeguard isn't yelling that there's a shark in the water, instead he's telling everyone there is a high probability of a shark and if they don't believe him they are shark deniers and they shouldn't go in the water or even on the sand for that matter because sharks have in the past been known to beach themselves, they were dead when that happened but thats besides the point it still happened therefore its possible to happen again so let's just close the beaches and in fact let's also not ever go to one again beaches are stupid anyways how about we all burn a church instead.</p>

        <p>I understand. I guess my whole point is that just because something is scary doesn’t mean it’s fake. If the media says something scary, we shouldn’t assume it’s false just because it’s scary, we should assume it’s false because of research and facts.</p>

        <p>The media scares you for everything. If you watch NEWS4 or whatever in your area they always do things like "is eating burnt toast giving you cancer? Find out tonight at 8PM" - You don't want cancer right? You tune in. Can we all agree that's conflated reporting?</p>
<p>I work in news media for a television network, for the internet EVERYTHING is for a click. I need you to be aware of this. I know the media because I work for the media. Scare tactics are real.</p>
<p>Now imagine a pandemic, the one we're in. A lot of people here have brought up great points about how we've learned so much about the pandemic in the last few months. A lot of the things are GOOD news.</p>
<p>Now take CNN for example. They are anti-trump. Meaning ANYTHING Trump says is a lie. I don't like Trump nor do I support his policies. I also think him and his cohort are doing the whole "DONT INFRINGE ON MY RIGHTS AS AN AMERICAN" bullshit and aren't aware of any data, just going off feeling...</p>
<p>Now, since Trump is going against a lot of the mandates (for the wrong reasons) can you imagine CNN ever coming out with a story that data might support something he aligns with (even if the reasoning is stupid). Nope, never never never. So we go down a deeper hole to prove him wrong.</p>
<p>This has been true for YEARS AND YEARS since the news has been politicized rather than just reporting on the facts.</p>
<p>To bring it back around, scare tactics aren't new, they're embedded in ways to get tune-in numbers. Tune-in numbers contribute to their ad dollars and what keeps their shows on air</p>

        <p>We should absolutely assume a skeptical stance whenever corporate-owned media is being alarmist and focusing on one issue to the exclusion of all esle.  And we should always be asking what is left out of the story, or given passing attention. </p>
<p>I remember the fury I felt over the many years news stories only mentioned the number of American soldiers dead in Iraq, never the number of Iraqi casualties. Now the unending <a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2013/3/20/ten_years_later_us_has_left">trauma inflicted on that country</a> is largely ignored.  Americans generally don't know which countries we are bombing at any given time, or what is allocated to the military in proportion to the rest of our budget.  If the media started doing 24-hour coverage on the destruction wrought by the U.S. empire, for months on end, our political landscape would change radically.  Instead we get fluff pieces on new military gadgets and fearmongering against Iran and Russia. </p>
<p>With lockdowns, MSM has ignored pretty much every self-inflicted wound, or wrongly attributed it. Such as that disruption from lockdowns could lead to an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/health/coronavirus-tuberculosis-aids-malaria.html">additional 1.4 million deaths</a> from tuberculosis and push <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/21/coronavirus-pandemic-will-cause-famine-of-biblical-proportions">265 million more</a> to the brink of starvation.  Human trafficking, hunger, missing women, child abuse, the "pink recession," the long-term effects of disruptions in healthcare, the children left behind in digital education: none of this is blanketing your screen. Instead we have nonstop talk about "cases" (which are meaningless), total silence or hit pieces when it comes to scientists that would point that fact out, and the continued stance that the rest of the planet and the regional poor don't exist. </p>
<p>If the media switched from focusing on the damages of covid to the damages of lockdown, you would have a totally different perception of risk. That's the power of the media and its few corporate owners. That same media that functions as the ultimate checkmate against any meaningful movements in the U.S.  If you don't understand this, I really don't know why you are in a leftist sub.</p>

        <p>Because the media gets you to “follow science” like this:</p>
<p>http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1174</p>
<p>-How many headlines use words that are meant to make interpretations for you? For example, how often do you hear the media report an increase in case counts as “surges” or “spikes?” Both of these words are subjective but imply a significant change. You can have an increase of one or two, the media will call it a surge, and you’ll panic.</p>
<p>-Why is it that the media loves to report on isolated rare deaths (making them appear more common by inducing the availability heuristic) but all of a sudden ignores “impressive” survivals like these (notice how these are all dated largely to early in the pandemic): </p>

<p>https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/28/us/woman-101-beat-coronavirus-trnd/index.html</p>

<p>https://nypost.com/2020/03/23/grandma-95-is-oldest-woman-to-recover-from-coronavirus-in-italy/</p>
<p>What do you think would happen if:</p>
<p>-the media favored reporting such survivals much more often than deaths</p>
<p>-converted “death rates” to “survival rates” (eg death rate of .05% is a survival rate of 99.95%)</p>
<p>-did not shove death counts into people’s faces 24/7</p>
<p>-were not engaging in lies of omission by failing to tell
People all that these scary things about covid are present in pretty much any other common airborne virus out there. You can get bad long term complications from the flu too (anecdotal: my mom got a bad flu that spread to her brain as a kid, leaving her with a life of migraines). As another example: do you really think hospitals had never had coolers on deck to store bodies in? For example: https://time.com/5107984/hospitals-handling-burden-flu-patients/ and https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2018/01/24/Hospitals-overwhelmed-by-influx-of-flu-patients/8171516800130/</p>
<p>The thing is, fear drives clicks. Clicks drive revenue. Media needs revenue to function.</p>

        <p>I'd just like to say that seatbelts and other safety equipment weren't invented because of fear. They formed a hypothesis that lives could be saved by providing more safety in cars. The data was collected, analyzed and a conclusion was reached. A solution was tested multiple times and approved. This how proper science should be done.</p>
<p>This is the first time mainstream media are constantly bombarding people with a counter for cases, they are exclusively reporting news that will increase fear of the virus, hardly mentioning the possible treatments being developed, the poverty and hardships that lockdowns are causing. They never question officials who contradict themselves or backtrack on decisions, never call people out on faulty logic or lack of proof, never mention that the number of cases is totally meaningless. This is not journalism, it's fear propaganda.</p>
<p>Lockdowns are supported by people who only get their information from these sources, who let fear decide their opinions and actions. I understand that you just want to follow the rules, not get in trouble and be able to go about your day but if you agree with what your "leaders" are doing, locking down because of rising case numbers, reducing your liberties because "what if", then you are living in fear and letting it cloud over your judgement</p>

        <p>What i personally am referring to when I say that are the multitude of articles and news reports like this one... <a href="https://archive.vn/y5eYO">Deadliest place in America</a> in which numbers are factually accurate, but the entire tone of the report is just FEAR! in case you don't want to read the article, it is referring to Gove County, Kansas. Population just over 2600. Number of total coronavirus deaths since the beginning of the "pandemic"? 20. But the media reported this as 1 in 132 residents dead from coronavirus. Which is true, but is intended to invoke more fear than 20 coronavirus deaths in 10 months.</p>

        <p>Yeah. It is technically correct. If you are really wanting to know about media manipulation there is a great documentary called Shadows of Liberty and it features a CBS reporter who tried to break the news on Nike and their terrible labor practices and was not only silenced but demoted, basically because CBS didn't want to make waves with Nike, as their sponsorship dollars were needed to offset the cost of obtaining the rights to air the Olympics. </p>

        <p>Ok. I’m not saying that the media is always right, regardless if it’s right wing(FoxNews Newsmax BreitBart Daily Wire Infowars etc) or left wing(CNN MSMBC CBS ABC NYT TYT etc) I just don’t understand the COVID truther argument that the media shouldn’t report on scary things, or talk about things that fear the public. I’m not saying that all COVID truthers believe that, but I’ve encountered some who believe that. </p>
<p>Your welcome. Politics is so interesting yet stressful. Everybody on both sides are so angry and hate the other side with a passion. I don’t like that. I don’t think it’s ever too late to learn something from someone you disagree with. I’ve really been trying recently to lean not on my own understanding, and become open minded enough to admit that everything I believe might be wrong. Thanks for the chat.</p>

        <p>The media told us that a million people were gonna die. Then no where near the prediction happened. They didn't adjust their reporting at all in terms of fear levels. Started focusing on case numbers bc they sound scarier even though those tests are meaningless and the vast majority of people have no symptoms. Young people have 99.999% survival rate and even old people have a 95% survival rate. And the death count is bogus too as it just counts people who had Covid in their system not who died of it. Combined with the fact that no more people are dying this last year... that's called manipulation. </p>
<p>Additionally something like 95% of the coverage is negative even when all the positive news comes out about death rate lowering. You just need to read out all the Covid headlines you see out loud to yourself and do it slowly. It's sci fi movie level fear mongering. </p>
<p>Let's keep going. Do you remember the Iraq war? Remember when terrorism was going to take over the world? Remember when we killed 200k Iraqi civilians bc people were told to be scared? Remember when they said it wasn't safe to fly unless you get molested? Your consent is manufactured. There are so many tools to control you and you think powerful people are gonna be nice and not use it to get more powerful?</p>
<p>History repeats itself over and over again. If you think the media has no incentive to have you scared and getting them ad revenue you are extremely naive. Look at a news site and step outside 2020. You would think it's a religious news site reporting the second coming.</p>

        <p>You may not be <em>consciously</em> living in fear but by bending the knee and masking up because the government told you to to protect against the "deadliest virus known to mankind", that <em>is</em> fear. Subconsciously fearing the disease, fearing getting flack for refusing to fall in line and going against the grain. You wear the mask because you want to conform and you're afraid of standing out. If you weren't truly living in fear you'd be doing what you can to rebel against draconic, anti-science measures the government has been taking against us. </p>
<p>Also, the media ALWAYS fear mongers, I don't recall a single time in my 26 years of living where the news was actually truthful and unbiased about something, every single news report has spin on it and has an agenda behind it. And with reporting of covid cases and deaths while conveniently leaving out the 99.9% recovery rate and effective therapeutic treatments and not questioning or calling out lies, that's fear mongering and propaganda. In addition, in 2012/13, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ndaa-legalizes-propaganda-2012-5">it was made legal for the media and government to lie and disseminate propaganda against the people.</a></p>

        <p>I know in my home state there is an intentional lack of context in the reporting, which I can only imagine is done to promote fear. Each day they display ‘hospital numbers’ but they include ‘persons under investigation’ who may or may not have the virus. Those people are never removed from the reporting. They also test everything person hospitalized whether it’s for a broken arm or a woman coming to deliver a baby.
They also report hospital numbers with no baseline. If you check - hospitalizations are the same this year as they were last year. There is no overcrowding or spike. But it’s reported with no information - just numbers that are paraded around to be scary.
Each day they highlight totals - meaning amounts since the BEGINNING of the pandemic because those numbers appear high and scary. There are SO many instances of this that it’s impossible to ignore.</p>
