    <strong>Life is just so depressing now..</strong>
    <p><p>Life is just so..Dull here at least in Massachusetts..</p>
<p>Nothing is really great around here. There's no events and even if there are you have to go through all these Covid protocol hoops &amp; wear a mask during the event. Every bloody store you go into everyone's wearing a fucking mask. I still see a good amount of people wear them outside at parks still. Nobody wants to engage with anyone because everyone's just used to keeping a mask on and staying away from others. Forcing myself to keep away from hanging out with my friends because I live with a Pro-Mask &amp; Pro-Restrictions family. I've been silenced so much from other subreddits on how the restrictions have caused me so much mental depression. My friends are busy with their own lives. </p>
<p>I've tried to be patient. I've made the sacrifices to "Make my household feel safe". It doesn't even feel like it matters if I'm allowed to go out because there is nothing that can distract me from this Covid shit. I know I might be coming off as cheesy, but this subreddit has been one of the best things out there that I found all year.</p>
<p>Every time I post I just feel like waves of depression and anger that I've been bottling up inside all year is coming out. I just feel like I can be myself here and finally have a place I can vent to about this shitty life that our fucking germophobtic society wants us to live in. So thank you so much. Thank you for allowing me to vent and post about the current world we live in. Well again at least from what I've been experiencing here in MA.</p></p>

        <p>Yes.  And it's just getting worse.  Every day the numbers go up, more people are sickened by this hoax virus, the CDC issues new draconian rules, and honest people who have the courage to question reality are persecuted.</p>
<p>If the CDC had their way we'd all have masks on our faces forever.  Even the little children.</p>

        <p>Same in Oregon. No music, no gatherings, no one laughs. I had to go out shopping today &amp; I was the only person not wearing a mask. WTF? </p>

        <p>You need to find like-minded people. I'm in a similar location as you but I was able to surround myself with people who don't give a shit about this stuff. I actually have done more stuff last year (2020) and hung out with more new people than I ever have in a single year (including the two months pre-covid, but still). Just because some random official venues (concerts, clubs?) are not open doesn't mean you can't have private "religious gatherings" with people just as you did before, take trips together, play outdoor sports games without giving a shit about this stuff, etc. </p>
<p>It's all in your head. Don't think about the things that are "missing". Thinking about the things you can create, do the things that you <em>can</em> do.</p>

        <p>People have been so blinded by this all that it’s going to take them a while to readjust to normal life again. Their brains are full of so much covid fear that even after they’re vaccinated they are still going to be afraid of strangers and being in public.</p>

        <p>This is normal.</p>
<p>They are wearing us down with this bullshit, so it's completely normal to feel this way. I feel it, too. Many things feel pointless nowadays, to the point where I struggle to be motivated because there is fuck all to do outside of work and see some friends here and there.</p>

        <p>Just tell them about the PCR tests running up the tally on the fake cases. We should be taking an antibody test not a PCR test. The true number of deaths in America is probably closer to 50,000, a fraction of what they are reporting.</p>
