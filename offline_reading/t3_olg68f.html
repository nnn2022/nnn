    <p><p>I'm fucking tired of being told I don't matter. That I have to put my entire life on hold because someone who's had theirs has a chance of a risk of possibly catching a cold virus and then MIGHT die with it. That my vaccination status is all I'm worth as a human being, regardless of how else I live my life and treat others. I know plenty of selfish assholes that are fully vaccinated; and of course they're the ones who are treating this like it's the most fucking serious thing EVER in the history of not only human kind but the fucking planet itself. COVID KILLED THE DINOSAURS.</p>
<p>Seeing the meltdown in the LA subreddit is equally depressing and uplifting. Many are clinging to their masks and vaccines, pouring scorn on all the unvaccinated, whilst some are finally fucking waking up and taking a more reasonable approach, maybe even entertaining the thought that this is all fucking staged and stupid. This only ends when you stop complying, the elites have made that fucking crystal clear now. They can move the goalposts forever if need be so long as the populace goes along with it.</p>
<p>Cases are rising but that means fuck all if the virus is weakened (which by all accounts it has been). The economy and society are fucked. Everyone's mental health is in the fucking toilet. I'm getting so fucking exhausted of defending and justifying my existence and swatting down fucking joy-sapping, mush-mouthed maskquitoes in arguments. Bottom line is this: people are coming dangerously close to fucking lashing out, either at themselves or others, and Gran and all the other fucking old folks at Shady Oaks Retirement Village will spend the last days, weeks, months or years of their lives in fucking isolated misery because you're too afraid to stand up and say ENOUGH.</p></p>

        <p>I'm a millennial, I've been told that 'society owes me nothing' and that I'm 'entitled', since I was a teenager.</p>
<p>Now? I'm told by people, who are feeling entitled, that I need to take this sketchy product made by sketchy companies, as my duty to society?</p>

        <p>Many world resets have happened before and will continue to happen. The kids working in mills and smaller houses from a 100 years ago in England tells me that the industrial revolution was about repopulating the world. Only really kids and a few adult lasted and I learn about this topic at school but by there narrative. The child trains of world war 2 and the Great Depression in America prove this. We had free Eletric and healing devices that Tesla created but then evil people wanted rid of them. You can’t make money off a health, free thinking population. They can’t foe your bodies over the last 30 years and the next 30 years is about your mind.</p>
