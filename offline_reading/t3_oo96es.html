    <strong>Let me know what you think of this initiative</strong>
    <p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>For a long time now I have had an issue with the current state of legislation, governance, and overall approach towards the COVID vaccine and pandemic control. I have always been very conformist since being confrontational is something that is not in my nature. I feel like many of my friends and family feel the same, but are unable to express this in the fear of being socially ostracised. </p>
<p>I feel the same way, and I decided to create a way of making waves and voicing my opinion without entering into significant confrontation. </p>
<p>I am going to leave these pamphlets in my seat every time I get up on public transport. I created a Twitter account that will have pdfs for people to download if they want to do the same.</p>
<p>I decided to go with this idea since I find that there is a lot of censorship, and I often find 'real' items more impactful. </p>
<p>Let me know what you think of my message and my initiative: <a href="https://twitter.com/whyirefused">https://twitter.com/whyirefused</a></p>
<p>Also, if you happen to like this idea and have a Twitter account. If you want to partake, please use the #whyirefused and take pictures of the piece of paper you left in the spot where you left it.</p>
<p>Perhaps that will make people feel like they are not alone.</p>
<p>p.s. I hope you do not take this post as self-promotion, though I guess it is. It was mainly intended to help and maybe inspire people to do the same.</p></p>
