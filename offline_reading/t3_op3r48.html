    <strong>A year and a half in, I still can't believe it.</strong>
    <p><p>If only this were just a horror movie. But no. People really laid down their freedoms, locked themselves inside, and prevented their children from having normal childhoods. Schools shut down worldwide, propaganda is being blasted everywhere you turn, and a fucking dehumanizing, identity-erasing mask is paraded as a symbol of virtue. That's only a few aspects of this, too. A living nightmare, except it's real life.</p>
<p>If someone had told me this was going to happen years ago, when I was on the verge of ending it all, I probably wouldn't be here today. But since I'm still here, I'm going to spite these psychopaths with every breath I take.</p>
<p>I just can't believe it. How do people just gleefully give up their rights?</p></p>

        <p>&rt;If national vaccinations of 'adults' breaks 80% we're in deep shit</p>
<p>I scarcely believe any covid-related statistics anyway</p>
<p>And the fact that the vaccine was politicized makes me suspect the currently reported US vaccination rate of 50% is a lie</p>
<p>It's probably closer to 35%...the supposed percent of the population that voted biden.</p>
<p>At this point they'll have to use very dramatic tools, like widespread food shortages, to convince any significant additional portion of the population to take the experimental vaccine</p>

        <p>(In Canada) hopefully Sept 21 (that it ends for good) or so on schedule, they already extended it another 4 weeks, and now the babybirds are back on all the relevant social media glooming and dooming how they need more money or their mortgages/kids, etc  will all starve etc.</p>
<p>Giving no f's for the rest of us who have had our businesses, livelihoods and freedoms destroyed due to their complacency.</p>
<p>They're hoping it will be extended again, as they are almost wishing the Delta variant narrative will mean more free $$$$.</p>
<p>Today, the US also mailed out some more checks for about the same amount $1300 USD is about $1690 CAD a month, so I know people getting paid bro.</p>

<p>As a dual citizen, I really feel for the folks up there in Canada. I knew Trudeau was bad news but had no idea it was gonna get that bad up there. Having lived a handful of years in worst case Ontario I am truly glad I yeeted myself out of there.</p>

<p>The reaction to covid in Canada has completely turned me off from the country I was born and raised in. It’s been so frustrating to watch Canadians hand over their freedom to the government. It’s pathetic really.</p>

<p>no TV channel was saying 'hey guys, its not that bad, we will solve this'.</p>
<p>no, every TV channel was like "OMGGGGGG WE'RE GOING TO DIE ALL'.</p>
<p>Everybody was waiting for a vaccine to end the madness.</p>
<p>we have the vaccine now, right? why is that it continues?</p>
<p>If you think that you're at risk then go, vaccinate, and thats it.</p>
<p>why do people who are not at risk are forced to vaccinate lmao.</p>
<p>My change to die from it is literally 0.01%, I don't want the vaccine, why do I need it for?</p>
<p>its bullshit.</p>
<p>they're going to hold on to this, its just a pretext, so they can still be in power and social engineer reality however they want.</p>

        <p>With ya there.  My whole family is under the spell sadly.  Parents say they get scared when out and about, to be fair they are in their 70's and I don't think the Vax will hurt them any more than basic old.age will.  If it helps their mental state, all good for them.</p>
<p>My Hubby is 67 and says he will cause no other option.  Frustrates.me as he just rolls over and won't fight.
Me, mid 40's stand strong in the opinion 'no way on this green earth until they sedate me and Vax by force' will I submit.</p>
<p>I also ignore all masking requirements and if pushed, I will walk out.</p>
<p>For reference here, I run cleaning (and other things) business in Port Hedland, West Aus.  We have had a steady stream of FIFO workers through our job runs since this started, and from all over the world.</p>
<p>Not one of our crew has had any issues to date.
No positive tests in town.
Wedeal with some serious many shit on the daily, and yet ... all healthy???? Who knew.</p>
<p>I've not accepted main stream news as truth for a decade or more and of late, refuse to even listen to it while hubby watches.</p>

        <p>I’m in disbelief myself. There are still people today saying we opened up too soon and shouldn’t have been allowed to take our masks off. At the moment it looks like more people are dying of the vaccine than the virus itself. The death rate is lower today than it was a year ago and the media is pumping out nonstop fear porn and people STILL believe it instead of looking at the numbers and the graphs. The death rate line for my county is FLAT and today KION news put out a story with a headline saying it’s time to lockdown and mask up again! It’s now clear as day that the vaccine is NOT the ticket to freedom and yet the sheeple for the most part are contempt living in this nightmarish dystopia.</p>

        <p>It’s become how I know if teachers are good teachers are not. </p>
<p>GOOD teachers are fighting with everything they have to return to in person learning for 2021-2022 because they care about their kids. One of my teacher friends taught remote in a district that didn’t have enough money to buy chrome books for everyone. For her low income students with no computer and no internet, they vanished. She worried about them CONSTANTLY. </p>
<p>BAD teachers enjoy teaching remote cause they get to stay at home and who cares if low income students suffer and abused kids don’t see a mandatory reporter all year? 🤷🏼‍♀️ they’re ROOTING for lockdowns and virtual school.</p>

        <p>I still can’t believe what we’re living through either. Society has been destroyed by fear mongering and propaganda. All of the case numbers and death numbers are misleading and inaccurate, by design. The entire thing is one giant misinformation campaign, and the majority of people have fallen for it. </p>
<p>People used to say it jokingly, but it truly is like we’re living in the twilight zone right now. Those of us who see it for what it is are being portrayed as crazy, by design. It’s absolutely insane.</p>

        <p>The catholic church completely ignores parts of the Bible they dislike. Revelations, the last book. Check it out. It's discusses the end times, the rapture, the tribulation, and God's 1000 year reign on earth.</p>

        <p>Seeing such seething hatred for people you don't know, is one of the worst outcomes of this whole thing. Luckily, there was never a hard lockdown where I live, so I never lived like a prisoner, and I'm sure plenty here can say the same. But to see people like yourself call others pathetic, degenerates, and worse, vermin and plague rats? It makes me wonder if you were this hateful before this whole mess or if the past year and a half made you snap.</p>
<p>Either way, I wish you the best. Hatred is terrible for your health.</p>
