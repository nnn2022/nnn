        <p>Delta variant? Not to my knowledge due to the variants change after the introduction of the vaccines. I had read somewhere (not looking up the source for anyone because I wont change anyones mind even if I provided the link) that the vaccine was still 80% effective with the delta variant so now were talking 2 of 10 infected with delta would have been vaccinated.</p>

        <p>I'm in the UK where virtually all the infections (vaccinated or unvaccinated) are due to the delta strain (as it states in the link). The effectiveness to the original strain is pretty irrelevant at this point when compared to the importance of the effectiveness to the delta strain. So if you've got a source on the effect of vaccination on transmission of the delta variant be really interesting to see it</p>

        <p>The link(image of tweet) says nothing about delta variant. The very likely trial he is referencing would have been the original trials, pre-delta, I'm sure trials are going on right now for a third shot to protect from the delta variant.</p>
<p>In any case what is your end game here? You provide a link that says original shots are 40% effective against delta which is 40% more effective than not getting the vaccine. </p>
<p>What are you trying to prove?</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Having caught the virus recently myself I don't think I should be required to get vaccinated when the level of natural immunity I require to be "more protected" than the vaccinated is as low as 40%. T-cell and antibody testing should be implemented to assess people's naturally acquired immunity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think it's perfectly reasonable that young, healthy people dont feel that the small risks associated with the vaccine are outweighed by a less than 50% reduced chance of  contracting the virus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vaccine passports make absolutely no sense if fully vaccinated people can still catch and spread the virus. Say if naturally acquired immunity from catching the delta variant gives you 80% protection, should only people with this immunity be allowed to travel freely and attend events, and not the vaccinated? Seeing as we've already accepted a 40% differential in protection to be sufficient to exclude one group from travelling freely and attending events.</p>

<p>The coronavirus isnt smallpox or polio. This is a virus that your body will constantly shed its acquired immunity off so vaccines for at least this generation and the next will be common until there is a natural immunity passed down through mother to child.  Constant testing would be financially impractical and impossible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That's the most selfish thought I see running rampant in you non-vaxxers. You dont get the vaccine for yourself if you're a young healthy adult, you get it for others...you live in a society correct? There are things you do, not because you want to but because you have to, in order to belong to a society. This is one of those things. Stop being a selfish prat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I dont really give a hoot about the vaccine passport but again to point 2, if this is what society expects (vaccine passports) in order to belong to society then either take one for the team or get off the bus.</p>

        <p>How is vaccination going to provide immunity that can be passed down through mother to child?</p>
<p>I'm selfish because I believe that having just caught the delta variant, I have a less than 40% of catching it again? Sounds more like common sense to me. Im not sure how people will respond to a lifetime of booster jabs, but I guess we'll see.</p>
<p>At what point do you draw the line at which a healthy young person shouldn't get the vaccine? 30% effectiveness, 20% effectiveness, 10% effectiveness, 5% effectiveness? At no point did I say that they shouldn't get it, I said I can understand why they wouldn't when the effectiveness has gone below an evens chance. Don't put words into my mouth.</p>

        <p>Through carrying a child to term... A mother will pass on antibodies to their child through the womb. That's why pregnant women are encouraged to get the flu vaccine. </p>
<p>A seasonal booster to lessen the effectiveness of the strain. That'll go over just like the flu shot people get now so itll be the very nominal percentage of folks (like yourself) that have a hard time accepting it.</p>
<p>You can understand why a young person wouldnt want to get vaccinated and that is because the vaccine currently isnt as effective towards the delta variant. So does your position change when a vaccine is introduced that has a 90-95% effectiveness against the delta variant? (Just like the original vaccine) Or is it still the same because if it's still the same then yes your "understanding" is a selfish viewpoint.</p>

        <p>You say a very nominal percentage but I don't know anyone who gets the flu shot in the UK who is under the age of 60- the group who is actually vulnerable to the flu.</p>
<p>Yes in that circumstance then they probably should get the vaccine. But I don't think it's the most heinous crime in the world to make a selfish medical decision and put their own interests first.</p>

        <p>I get it and I'm under 40 and am in perfect health, doctors, nurses and anyone in the medical field will get it. I know dozens of people under 60 that get the flu vaccine..maybe it's the people we hangout with that is the dividing factor. </p>
<p>Not heinous but if it doesnt hurt you or the person being vaccinated and you have the opportunity to stop the spread of an illness that can kill it's still an incredibly selfish decision. I didnt want to get it, but I did because I have an infant son and parents over 60 and I dont want to see people lose loved ones for something that if we all work together doesnt have to happen. </p>
<p>I think at the end of the day youd get the vaccine if you knew you could save lives. You arent stupid like my fellow American anti-vaxxers (we drink bleach at the behest of a politican), I just think you're building a hill to die on that you dont need to.</p>

<li>(Again) I find the "what society expects" argument to be very strange. If people with natural immunity are less likely to catch and spread the virus than vaccinated people, but vaccinated people are the ones who are allowed freedoms, then it is completely anti-science and unjust. I don't know how you could justify it in that scenario, and it sets such a dangerous precedent that huge decisions like that don't have to be based on facts.</li>

        <p>Because no one knows who has natural immunity so there is no way to control the outcome/accomplish the goal. At least with a vaccine you have a record to prove your words. </p>
<p>In your personal example you could be lying to me that you had the delta variant and it was actually from pounding too much beer the night before, am i supposed to take you at your word?

        <p>My record of a positive PCR test will be on the same medical database as a vaccine,  I could get an antibody and T-cell test done too and get them to print off a nice little certificate summing it all up for you. The creation of a certificate isn't unique to proof of vaccination, it could also be done for proof of naturally acquired immunity.</p>

        <p>Well the really big difference is the vaccine, or no vaccine part. Whilst you see no problem with the sort of thing I proposed, governments do and are insisting on vaccine passports only.</p>

        <p>Then there are 2 things potentially at play. 1. The PCR test isnt a viable form of certification that you still arent capable of passing covid or 2. The vaccine passport legislation isnt fully known in detail and may very well include other "forms of identification" which could include the PCR test as proof of natural immunity.</p>

<li>Hence why antibody and T-cell tests</li>
<li>Looks very unlikely with the messaging we've received so far.</li>

        <p>Let it play out. For businesses you'll likely not have much say, but youd think for government theyll need to hear both proponent and opponent view before deciding something like this and if what you're saying is true then I dont see any reason that the PCR test wouldn't qualify.</p>
