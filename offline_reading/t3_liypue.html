        <p>Agree with others here that the title is a bit misleading, but I can see the merit behind it and it's not entirely wrong.</p>
<p>Statistics, metrics, analytics, whatever you want to call it, are better suited to sell something to a target group rather than supporting actually scientific facts. The vast majority of people will just accept something if it has an X- and Y-axis and some numbers that make sense at first glance. Pair that with something that is loaded with emotions et voila, SCIENCEâ„¢, ladies and gentlemen!</p>
<p>The best part of statistics is, they aren't even necessarily lies or wrong. They are probably correct for the chosen criteria and the desired outcome. If you just tilt the table enough, statistics can prove literally anything.</p>

        <p>Well, in the video he says he based a prediction upon a previous fact, and when it was printed in a headline people got shocked, even if it was just part of normal day-to-day events. That seemed to be his desired outcome.</p>
<p>I feel that is an important point, because it was exactly what happened in the beginning, and what continues to happen with headlines about "the new British strain" and so on and so on.</p>
<p>As for other deliberately misleading statements over the last year, there are of course many:</p>
<ul>
<li>The constant reminder about "covid deaths", without putting it into perspective compared to the normal baseline.</li>
<li>Little or no information about the age of people dying. (It's really sad that young people are running around scared for their lives).</li>
<li>Graphs of raw data without caveats. The most typical is reporting numbers (new cases and deaths) for the whole weekend together with Monday's numbers. That way, the chart gives the impression that the numbers are three times as high. (A 7-day moving average would easily solve it, but it's seldom you see that).</li>
<li>No discussion on primary, secondary causes of death. (The death by breaking the neck on a ladder fall labelled as covid related is a cliche by now).</li>
<li>My favorite headline construct "X <em>highest since</em> Y". You can make anything seem shocking that way, just by picking the numbers and dates right.</li>
<li>Any chart including data from China. That was obvious misinformation, but it continued for quite a few months last spring.</li>
</ul>

        <p>You're probably right with these points, and it's been points that have been brought up by many people before. Whatever is being published now only seems to serve to reinforce something that was initially just an arbitrary collection of datasets interpreted in a specific way to steer public discourse, and since then we've come such a long way that the constant repeating of never-changing criteria is now seen as gospel.</p>
<p>Once the "seed was planted" so to speak, they didn't really need that many sources, data or metrics anymore anyway. Once the ball gets rolling and people are startled initially this entire thing basically runs itself. It's something I'd normally expect a terrorist to do, using fear as a measure to achieve a goal.</p>
<p>What dawned on me is that it probably always has been this way but it never was apparent enough to be actually noticeable, at least for myself. No idea how it was for others. Then again, I never cared for the shitshow the media is pulling off or any bigger issues until a couple years ago.</p>
<p>But yeah, I feel like with every passing day we're just getting more and more to this point where it's going to be impossible to convince people with facts and logic, not that it was anywhere close to possible to begin with. The only way out is if the official narrative leaps forward too quickly and more people start to realise that something has gotten terribly out of hand at some point.</p>
<p>Sorry, got sidetracked. I agree with your post.</p>

        <p>Yeah, the narrative did take on a life of its own. Remember the panic buying of toilet paper and food last March. The shelves were empty. That was truly bizarre.</p>
<p>However, I also feel that the a lot of the blame lies with mainstream media. In the first months, the coverage was just completely overwhelming. It was non-stop corona. Of course, not very much actually happened from hour to hour, so it was just the same sound bite on repeat. The death-ticker was always there, and you still see it in news paper web articles. (Cynical voices in America relate the ticker to the Trump presidency. However, it was the same in Europe).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Has it always been this way? Well, obviously there's always a side to the story you never get to hear through reading a single source. Still, I feel the general population has never been lied to and misled at this large scale in a very long time.</p>
<p>You'd have to go back to the lead-up to the second Iraq war in 2003 to find a similar disinformation. But back then, the Bush / Blair administrations had most of the media against them.</p>
<p>Before that, you'd have to go back to pre-1989 communism in Eastern Europe. Maybe the Cold war. Or Vietnam. Although, in most of Western Europe, there hasn't been similarly oppressive measures and totalitarian authorities since the German occupation during WWII from 1939 to 1945.</p>

        <p>True, it hasn't been on a scale as large as the current one. Part of me was just entertaining the thought that maybe we've been lured around for longer than we think. I have come to thinking "What can I even believe anymore?", and the next consequential thought was "How long has this been going on?"</p>

        <p>I'm happy to hear different points of view on it. Here's what I picked up on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be quick to push out the message, and stay available to all media in the early days. That way, "they are not going to search for alternative voices".</li>
<li>Appoint a non-partisan "naive" person to manage the communication, to avoid people in power taking the blame.</li>
<li>State a previous fact in a sensationalist way, to attract attention and make people afraid.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the last point is important. The collusion between governments and mainstream media is what got us into this mess to begin with. It is exactly what happened in March 2020 and what continues with stories about "the new British strain" and so on.</p>
<p>(Now, about the video, with the laughter in the background, I can't be quite sure if this is just satirical comedy. But hey, even so, the points above would still stand).</p>
