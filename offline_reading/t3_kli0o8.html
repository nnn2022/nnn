    <strong>Why do employees care about masks?</strong>
    <p><p>Seriously, why do people that work at stores care about people wearing masks? I've worked retail, and one of the worst things was having to confront customers. They could be drunk, under the influence of drugs, mentally unstable, an asshole, or perfectly normal. You never know how they will react. I didn't get paid enough, and would usually ignore it unless it was something egregious. </p>
<p>If these stores are located in regions that have mandatory mask requirements to stay open, I could understand that. Shit flows down stream, and management would be looking for someone to throw under the bus, if the store could fined or shut down. After the customer says they have an exemption, why are they still arguing? They can't legally ask what the exemption is or discriminate against them. Why waste time and energy over arguing about something that will not change anything. </p>
<p>This behaviour makes absolutely no sense. Why are these wage slaves arguing, it serves them no benefits, they will not be promoted for it. The only thing it causes is unnecessary stress and work.</p></p>

        <p>One basically told me "If I have to wear one, your have to wear one".</p>
<p>If I worked at a store, I'd just pretend I didn't see it. But maybe these people are on a power trip. Maybe it gives them a sense of power that they normally don't experience.</p>

        <p>I believe some don't care, but I've seen others go out of their way to confront customers. When the mask mandates first were implemented, I had a cashier prevent me from pumping gas unless I put on a mask, which I didn't have at the time. I was at least fifteen feet from anyone else, but I ended up having to go to another gas station.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it made me mad too. I drove up to the pump and there was a sign, <em>Please see Cashier</em>. When I walked up, she told me she wouldn't turn the pump on unless I put a mask on. I tried to argue, that I was way out by the pump alone, but it didn't work.</p>

        <p>The only times I’ve been kicked out of stores it was by people who certainly take special pleasure in finally getting to boss around their customers. It’s almost like they’re looking for an argument/confrontation. And when I smile, say “okay,” drop my merchandise and leave, they seem completely caught off guard. I don’t want to support their business anyhow.</p>

        <p>I never challenge customers in our shop (and they never challenge me, so far at least) and I don't usually bother limiting the number of people in store either unless asked to by a superior. We are a small shop, people can see how busy we are and make their own decision, and often people will just walk in even if there is a blatant big red sign up asking them to wait. I'll let them try on hats and gloves too, so I guess I must be evil 😂</p>

        <p>Working for minimum wage in retail dealing with dickhead public every day, I'm sure now that they have a reason to kick someone out, they will take it to the highest degree. Added to the fact that people are becoming more and more narcissistic by the day, and the clearly evident world of hatred online for "anti-maskers", where they can find some validation for it. Nobody is really that interesting, and it gives an employee a feeling of power in their usually mundane life.</p>

        <p>There is nothing wrong with my reading comprehension. You are trying to imply that only 6% of people reported died with covid, as if having any other condition at the same time means you didn't die of covid, which is just not true.</p>
<p>If I had hemophilia and then was stabbed and bled to death you wouldn't say I died of hemophilia. Yes, the hemophilia meant a stab wound would more likely kill me than it would a perfectly healthy person, but it does not negate the stab wound as the cause of death.</p>
<p>I can't speak for Californian/American ICUs, but here in the UK where people don't have to worry about possibly going bankrupt if they visit a hospital, yeah we are getting pretty damn full. Recently Northern Ireland had to draft in ambulances from the Republic of Ireland, which incase you missed it means we had to draft in help from a different country ffs.</p>

        <p>Oh now you're going to tell me that even if one essential worker dies, it's too much?  Yet that applies to covid only right?  I mean, you don't want to shut down for the flu, or car accidents on the way to work, do you?  No, your argument is so self-centered and asinine, that you are making only about the one that died of covid- not about the many other forms of death of essential workers, right?</p>
<p>There is death every day and you know it.  The number of essential workers dying from covid would be barely even countable it's so low.  More essential workers die in car accidents each year.  Show some compassion for them!</p>

        <p>Nowhere in that article does it say only 6% of reported deaths were caused by covid. Even the part where some guy is playing down the actual death toll he says it could be "as low as" 50%. So even if that guy wasn't spewing bs, the lowest it could be as reported in that article is 50%. Also did some research, the amount of false claims PJ media has published make it a laughable source.</p>

<p>I don't know what's wrong with your reading comprehension, but okay. </p>
<p>And Los Angeles County in California is claiming 1 covid death every 10 minutes yet for that to happen, they'd have to have thousands of brand new covid hospitalizations every single day- each day thousands more patients each and every day to get 144 deaths- and every one of those new patients would have to be brand new to the virus- which isn't possible.  Thus, the virus death count is being overblown- also, do you want to know the ICU capacity right now?  Like 13%!  hospitals are EMPTY!!!!!!!  As is the one where I work.  EMPTY!</p>

        <p>I think not only are you trying to spread misinformation, but you’re blatantly biased lying.
Your last line was what got me. ICU capacity. There are many articles about many health care systems being at a breaking point, and I think it’s the opposite of patriotic to paint it as the hospitals are empty and covid isn’t a problem.
You mentioned Los Angeles. Well here is an article from Los Angeles times from Dec 29 about the hospitals being completely overwhelmed and turning away people. It’s basically titled “I’ve never seen anything like this” which echoes around the world. Some health care systems are beyond strained compared to anything they’ve ever had, and to bias paint it the way you are is wrong</p>

<p>California has been redefining the term "ICU Capacity" to make themselves seem worse than they really are.  I'm so sick of fake ass reporting in order to spread fear.  Real danger doesn't have to be faked.  Stop spreading misinformation.  Every single bit of this bullshit pandemic has been debunked starting with that lie that Hydroxychloroquine is not an amazing treatment for Covid.  It is.  It's safe and effective and cheap.  It's been used for decades for a great number of things and the media made everyone afraid of it.</p>

        <p>Here is a quote from the link you just gave me, it shows how you are completely using the word capacity wrong. You seem to think when they say 13% capacity, they mean they are only 13% full, when in fact the article is talking about the remaining beds and 13% capacity means 87% filled.</p>
<p>“The only region that has not dropped below 15% is the sparsely populated Northern California region, which had 29% ICU availability as of Monday.</p>
<p>Alarms have been going off since two of the regions — sprawling Southern California and the San Joaquin Valley — dropped nearly two weeks ago to 0% on the ICU capacity meter. The Bay Area region is at 9.5%, and the Greater Sacramento region is at 16.6%.</p>
<p>But how do those percentages, ranging from zero to nearly 30, add up to a statewide ICU capacity of 0%?”</p>

        <p>So then nut up and face those repercussions. You think nobody here has ever been kicked out of a store? The people who care about this shit are cowards. Most everywhere the biggest repercussions you face is people making stupid speeches. No-one's going to attack you, Christ.</p>
