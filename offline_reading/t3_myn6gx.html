        <p>“Long COVID” is pretty much just an updated name for “post-viral syndrome” to further scare and blackpill the doomers. </p>
<p>I got post-viral syndrome after having mono a few years ago. It’s by no means a new phenomenon, but for some reason people still fucking eat it up like flies on shit.</p>

        <p>Most people with “Long COVID” either tested negative for the disease, or were asymptomatic.</p>
<p>Some of them probably do have legitimate post-viral syndrome. But it seems like at least 90% of them just have a psychogenic (basically imaginary)  illness. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_psychogenic_illness</p>
<p>Some people with Long Covid claim to recover after getting vaccinated.</p>

        <p>To be fair, mono is no joke, and Epstein Barr is recently identified as a possible cuplrit behind multiple sclerosis, under the theory that if the infection got into your nervous system then any reflares of mono might produce more neurological scarring.  So "lots of viral infections do this" isnt really comforting, its associated with really nasty ones</p>

        <p>I have a niece (23F) that got the vaccine. No previous infection or health issues. She got covid shortly after and has been dealing with it for over a month now. My wife 42F got it, cold like symptoms for 4 days, I 43M got it 4-5 days tired. </p>
<p>I'd definitely roll the dice with not getting it, or getting it naturally over getting the vaccine. People keep comparing side effect statistics vs covid statistics. But not factoring in that not everyone is getting it. Often when I mention having had it people are aghast that they're actually interacting with someone who's had this terrible virus. If it's that rare what are you scared of? I suppose the media has them believing they don't know anyone who's had it because NO ONE SURVIVES!!!!!</p>

        <p>I have read so many posts of people getting covid after being vaccinated it's crazy. Granted they are telling people that they still can get it despite getting the 'jab' many of my older clients believe that they are immune. I'm a cosmetologist. I'm not going to get this vaccine although I have had others in the past. If I were to get covid I'd try to be treated with Ivermectin. I was just trying to reason with my oldest daughter tonight that even the 'slight' chance of side effects with this vaccine is not worth it. A vaccine that does not give immunity. You can still catch covid and spread it. You will need booster shots. It may or may not be effing up your natural immunity for the long term.</p>

        <p>My only regret in having had it is that I didn't take ivermectin. I actually had some in my house. My wife had been prescribed it for rosaceae or some skin condition during covid. We tried to get it but couldn't (was going to be over $200). Then I heard them talking about it on NoAgenda (podcast) that it was a horse dewarmer. Found it at a local farm supply store for $5. It took care of my wife's skin issue and we have plenty left over.</p>

        <p>I haven't gone as far as to try and have some on hand yet. I keep hoping Dr's will come around and start trying it out themselves. It is a legal drug after all. But good to know that in dire circumstances there are other resources out there.</p>

        <p>Plenty of doctors have been giving it out with very good results. The problem is if there's a known, effective treatment they can't get emergency use authorization for a vaccine®. So they've been effectively shut down.</p>

        <p>So you didn't listen to it then? I would like to think as a Dr/pcp your main objective is to help people and maybe that means taking the time to listen to what other Dr's are saying. So you listen to your mentors who are not special? I'm starting to question if you are truly a Dr. Here is a guy presenting multiple trials, cases in which it works, presenting his case in front of the senate with other Dr's and scientists and you don't even want to take time to listen.</p>

        <p>I have spent lots and lots of my own time to looking at the available data from reliable sources. But it’s very hard to prove credentials on YouTube (which is one reason it’s such a hotspot for misinformation and outright fraud), so I will not waste my time on a source that could be literally anyone.</p>
<p>If you were trying to research the safest car for your family and I told you to spend 2 hours talking to this guy standing on Main St who says he’s a car safety expert - would you? What if you had already gone to school for 12 years for car safety and had 10 more years experience in that exact field?</p>

        <p>This guy is an expert. (look for yourself) He lists his credentials and trial links in the video. The guy interviewing him, Dr John Campbell, is actually provaccine. So question for you. A patient and or family comes in and says please give ivermectin. "a neighbor of ours was really sick, at 60% Oxygen and given a 40% chance to live. They wanted to put him on the vent. They did not vent him instead they tried steroids and ivermectin and he made a miraculous recovery and is now home today." Would you then consider it?</p>

        <p>Uhh “even the slight chance of side effects with this vaccine is not worth it” but you’d want to take ivermectin for covid?</p>
<p>From a 2018 study before ivermectin was politicized. It’s not a super safe drug...
