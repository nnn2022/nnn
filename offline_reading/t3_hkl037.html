        <p>That sucks. I guess that's just "hostile" of you, but they totally have the "right: to educate the idiot, I guess.   It's so ridiculous, which citysub/reddit did you get banned from? Ugh. Sometimes I feel crazy. I wish I could find ACTUAL like minded, or at least truly open minded people. Everyone is so black and white. This is a little bit of a rant, but I've been trying to make friends and connections, but everyone is completely brainwashed in someway, they only believe what their friend groups or political parties agree with. I'm not trying to be political, but for some reason, everyone else is. Sometimes I feel like I'm the only pro-gun, pro-choice, pro sex work tranny who makes horrible offensive jokes and loves hunting, because I haven't met anyone like that. lol I'm just going crazy... I needed to rant.</p>

        <p>Oof. That sucks. I might check it out for a laugh. Sorry you have to deal with that. Right? Me too, I'm not political, there's no point with my opinions. I will never understand people who agree with anything that they think is "correct".</p>

        <p>Austin is one of the worst local subs on this site even in the best of times. Right now it's a hole in the ground filled with shit. It's also the sub that had some asshole go around to 30 different stores to check mask compliance.</p>

        <p>The signs said to stay home in April and May. The state closed down the day after our first case was detected. We're a poor state and we're in big, big trouble. Our governor is disgusting. She is practically drooling at the thought of our demise.</p>
