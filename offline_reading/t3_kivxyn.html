    <strong>Vaccines work, yes, but forcing vaccination is still wrong</strong>
    <p><p>Vaccines have been proved to work time and time again. And I believe vaccines are good. What I do not like is that some people seem to want to force others to vaccinate. These are usually the same people that say "my body, my choice" and I myself believe so too, which is why I think people themselves should decide what happens to their body. I myself might vaccinate even, but not if I'm forced to. Some vaccines also have side effects that some people would like to avoid.</p>
<p>These dommers, other than wanting to force vaccination, want to remove free speech whilst claiming to advocate for it. Free speech is being able to say what you want and have it challenged, not taking down statements that don't fit with your narrative or opinion.</p>
<p>Tl;dr people should be able to do what they want with their body, even if vaccines do work, and free speech should remain a thing that we have.</p></p>

        <p>The vaccine is under emergency authorisation, hasn't been peer reviewed or the study replicated, and hasn't yet been shown to prevent spread (sterilising immunity). It's probably the best idea to vaccinate those who are most at risk of complications from the virus.</p>

        <p>healthy individuals are the ones better able to withstand the harmful effects of vaccines. that is why they are more willing to advocate for vaccines. their healthy organs can manage the toxic stress with less <strong>immediate</strong> adverse effects.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>long term consequences of a drug/vaccine are hard to prove. vaccines and drugs put a heavy load on the organs(especially kidneys and liver), thus lowering their performance capacity, leading to disease over time. combine with with poor diet and lifestyle which also contribute to worsening organ performance. this could be staying up late, abusing caffeine, alcohol, cannabis, eating unhealthy foods, or even eating healthy foods in unhealthy amounts.</p>

<p>give elderly a vaccine and it has a far higher chance to be the straw to break the camel's back.</p>

        <p>Healthy individuals are better able to fight against Covid 19 and have an extremely high survival rate. So why vaccinate them at all? It only makes sense if it stops a person from being contagious, but they haven't proved that yet</p>

        <p>I agree with you. I’m autistic, and as pro-vaccines as you can be. Why? Because they have been proven to be safe. The reason I won’t be getting the COVID vaccine is because it HAS NOT been proven safe. I’m tired of seeing people on here, who are supposed to have more common sense that the doomers, say all vaccines are bad/the earth is flat/moon landing is fake etc.</p>

        <p>I doubt anyone is saying all vaccines are bad.  What they are saying (correctly) is that their claims for both safety and efficacy are overblown.  More injuries happen than they'll admit, and fewer lives are saved than they'll admit.  The entire point is to create medical products (using public funding) and get them on the vaccine schedule (cash cow), and have blanket immunity from being sued if anyone gets injured. (1986 Vaccine Act).  </p>
<p>Every company making these vaccines has been convicted of killing people and paid millions in fines for doing so.</p>

        <p>yet another thing that has upset thru all of this, is not whether they work at all, its some of the side effects and how those claiming side effects are/were treated.  They face the same type of opposition that we as antilockdowners face, and that makes me wonder what the truth is. They used the same playbook against them as they do us, and censorship is always a bad sign, always signals the censorer cant withstand scrutiny</p>

        <p>&rt; Vaccines have been proved to work time and time again </p>
<p>What makes you think this is true?  Do you have any evidence to support this statement?  </p>
<p>Here's a counter-argument proving that sanitation, not medical intervention, is responsible for 97% of the health improvements during the 20th century.  This would indicate that vaccine makers are stealing the thunder from the garbage men, and water and sewer operators who have brought us <strong>civilization itself</strong>.  Down with white coats!  Up with yellow vests!</p>

<p>Not sure if you'll trust this site but that proves vaccines work in my eyes. Their effectiveness can be discussed however, as some vaccines have less effectiveness and more potential side effects. You are definetily right in that sanitary conditions have contributed to less disease being spread and I agree with you to an extent here.</p>

        <p>Read the link I posted.  I think you'll be surprised by what it reveals.</p>
<p>The sciencemag article says that cases of measles have surged.  So what!?  Measles is a common (formerly ubiquitous) childhood disease with a very high survival rate for people who aren't living in crushing poverty.  The only death mentioned in the article was of a 17 year old who died <strong>one day</strong> after receiving the vaccine, but they're SURE it's not related to the shot (though they offer no proof).   </p>
<p>If anything, this article proves the opposite of your point.  When a disease is blowin' around among healthy people, it's not that big a deal and will eventually fizzle out.  But when people have a high disease burden all the time due to open sewers, rats, etc, any disease that comes through is going to give them a very hard time.  The vaccine may give your immune system specific information about the disease it's meant to prevent, but it's not able to improve your health or make an overtaxed immune system work effectively.</p>

        <p>Pro vax ppl always assume you are uneducated and don’t understand vaccination mechanics.  I’ve read all the papers, seen the videos, and seen the stats.  It’s not that.  It’s the lack of transparency, lack of vetting, suggestions that we should accept government mandates about health, and lack of trust for larger institutions.</p>

        <p>Yeah well I personally support vaccination and believe it to be a good thing for the most part. I haven't had any serious side effects not does anyone I know. But still, people should decide themselves if they want vaccination. If the government starts saying everyone should walk around with a swastika on their arm, we should be skeptical about that just as much as any other thing the government says. So if someone doesn't want to be vaccinated, then so be it, it's their choice whether they're injecting substances into their body or not!</p>

        <p>Well some vaccines do have severe side effects, I can see that, but I will still continue to vaccinate myself against any disease I think I may have a large risk of being exposed to, if it is dangerous that is.</p>
<p>I guess we have opposing opinion on this matter, though I guess we agree on the fact that lockdowns, face masks etc. are unnecessary, yes?</p>

        <p>But you have just because you don't overt effects doesn't mean you didn't get damaged from it and even if you as a individual didn't doesn't mean everyone else is safe. Look at the rate of autistic children these last 30 years since vaccines became mainstream. Notice a trend?</p>

        <p>No relationship between vaccines and austism has ever been proven. The link between non-vaccination and death from preventable diseases is fact. Autism hasn't been a diagnosable illness for all that long, which is why there are more diagnoses. Before that, it was just "retardation," and you'd send the person off to rot in an asylum.</p>

        <p>The main problem I see is that vaccine companies are immune to liability for any damages their products cause. However, the US government has a vaccine injury fund, of which it’s payed out billions of dollars to people injures by vaccines. What this shows is that the manufacturers have no incentive to make the vaccine safe, and there are many people who have been damaged one way or another from vaccines. </p>
<p>Not everyone gets paralyzed or dies or something from a vaccine, for many it may cause problems like allergies, which are on the rise. Even though correlation isn’t necessarily causation, the pro vaccine group cannot prove that vaccines are safe. Foods, are never one size fits all, neither is medicine, yet we treat vaccines like a magical thing that works for everyone. Vaccines have their uses like all medicine, but this society is treating them like a holy grail. As useful as Tylenol can be, you never hear talk of mandating this product, each person should have their autonomy when it comes to what they put in their body. If you want to take a vaccine, then take it. No one should be forced to.</p>

        <p>Nobody should be forced to get vaccinated, we agree on that.</p>
<p>My understating is that vaccine manufacturers would not manufacture vaccines without that protection in place, and that's why it was enacted in the 80s. The vaccines still need approval from the FDA. Doesn't seem like a great system, but it doesn't mean vaccines are dangerous or cause autism or any of that far-out unscientific junk.</p>

        <p>That's the thing - there were <strong>so many</strong> injuries, the vaccine makers were getting slaughtered in civil court for causing thousands of injuries and having to pay damages for all of them - side effects are not rare!  Not only did their liability go away, so did the forum for airing grievances once a person was injured.  Sure, they implemented the vaccine court, but the bar is high, the statute of limitations is short, and if you get a vaccine and go back to your doctor a month later with side effects, they are likely to blow you off and say it's genetic or some  other bullshit while rejecting any possibility that the injury could be vaccine related.  I know because it happened to me with my daughter.   So your doctor won't even advocate for you, and administrators of the vaccine court admit that the program we have now captures less than 1% of the total number of vaccine injuries that occur.  Whatever rates of injury they claim, multiply by 100X.</p>
<p>Peanut allergies were unheard of circa 1990.  Baby raising advice says not to give children under 1 year old peanuts.  Guess what's in all of the 2,4,6,12 month shots?  Peanut oil.</p>

<p>The approval from the FDA is a rubber stamp.  The bar for safety testing is low, and performed by the vaccine maker themselves.  </p>
<p>Like I said, multiply the injuries you know of or that are reported by 100X - that's what the VAERS people have admitted to.  The shot gives encephalitis and destroys the gut biome.  Imagine baby poop changing from regular and gross to blowing out the ass of the diaper 10 times a day for almost a year.  </p>
<p>Remember when they Nazis on trial said, "I'm just following orders."?  This is the same thing, but we are tricked and coerced into doing it unknowingly, to our own children, thinking we're doing the right thing.</p>

        <p>Sorry mate, vaccines have not ben proven to work except in cases whereby the virus demonstrates extremely limited mutagenesis characteristics. If you do some research most vaccinations for various pathogens occurred far beyond the threshold of organic herd immunity  and were already phasing themselves out, measles for example. Other viruses like polio now have more vaccine derived strains than the wild polio version and is still running rampant. Annual flu vaccines have never shown to have any impact and their stats eventually combined with pneumonia  to demonstrate a reduction in overall deaths and encourage vaccination coverage. However pneumonia is treated through a number of other medications and it is these treatments, not the vaccines that have reduced the mortality rates in this category. My father has had pneumonia multiple times and is a high risk, he used to get the annual flu shot and then stopped...so did his pneumonia,,hmmm. Also look at the mortality rates of children in countries who have infant vaccination programs..The more dosages the higher the infant mortality rates. </p>
<p>The initial principle of the vaccine was genuine, albeit the testing of such methods was highly irresponsible, however proved to possess a degree of viability. You can't argue the basic premise of such science, take a dead or weakened strain and inject it into the body whereby the immune system has plenty of time to respond before the virus van infect a host cell and begin the replication cycle. That being said, this is not the science that has carried on. It has evolved into a mutated form, like a virus lol, to where they are injecting toxic agents into our bodies and only partial fragments of the virus, such as proteins, which can resemble healthy normal proteins that exists in our bodies inherently, therefore our immune systems ebgin to recognize these normal proteins as foreign invaders  and begin to attack them..Our bodies basically enter a stage of an ongoing battle against itself..Ever wonder why over the last 50 years or so there has been a drastic upsurge in immune system related disorders?</p>
<p>Vaccine science may have kicked off with a noble goal, but tat has long been abandoned only to be replaced by this modern day mad science using us as lab rats for their twisted experiments and being run by a eugenicist who's been touting depopulation for years.</p>
<p>The right and only way to manage a potential viral threat is to isolate the vulnerable, and in todays world there should be no excuse to provide state of the art accommodations for these people with all the amenities they need to be comfortable for those who choose. You could literally have entire communities built for the purpose of housing the vulnerable in a pandemic. Next step is to let the virus run it's course through the healthy population until it dies off or it has mutated to the point where it is no longer a threat and then reintroduce the vulnerable back into mainstream and any variation of the virus will be virtually inert, however they will also be able to develop the necessary antibodies to fight off a future emergence of a virus from the same family tree.  What we have seen and are currently  seeing COVID do right now is absolute bullshit and defies all laws of viruses. They are literally trying to mimic the Spanish flu, and yet everything around the Spanish flu is pure speculation at best. </p>
<p>Anyways no harm no foul, just trying to shed some light on the perceived benefits of vaccines.</p>
