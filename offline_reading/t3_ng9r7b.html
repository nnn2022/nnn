        <p>No cause we’re patriotic and care about each other. And tbh its not locked down than in America, like we can still go outside and go shopping drinking and so on, its mainly just big groups concerts that are canceled. So im not an idiot, you’re just wrong and apparently also a very bad human being.</p>

        <p>Well thats because you’re stupid and unpatriotic. We like to restrict freedom for the greater good, we like to restrict our own personal freedom at our own will because we know we’re helping people in need. Instead of being selfcentered jackasses try thinking of other people for once!</p>

<p>What’s funny is that there was never any scientific proof that did work when they we’re put into place.</p>

        <p>Not even worth arguing with u/thedax101. I was arguing with him on another comment and saw he was arguing with you... I’m pretty sure it’s either a bot or a brainwashed 15 year old that doesn’t understand the concept of freedom and the danger of “big” government. Just goes straight to insulting you instead of being able to justify his point or back anything up... when you start throwing insults at people it means you lost the argument. He believes Europe has more freedom than America, that right there shows its not even worth your time to argue.</p>

        <p>Maybe read a little, study even? Idk most of the things you go around saying is the stuff we over here in Europe make fun of you for. Why? Cause it is and sounds batshit crazy. Im not a 15 year old boy with no life experience, but you sure as a hell sound like one. When you study a little politics and grow up you’ll understand. Im sry if i didn’t have time to write you little notes with scientific proof for everything i said but this is reddit.</p>

        <p>See, many of those seem to be legit, but most of them are written by people researching the negative effect of lockdown. And yes there are some, but they do t say thT they’re not effective in dealing with the spreading of disease. </p>
<p>On another note, what about the hundreds of papers saying that lockdown does work? </p>
<p>The few i read on your list seem to be written by psychiatrist and medical profs not virologists that study the spreading of diseases and so on. And most of the papers also say that it does kinda help with lockdown, maybe not as much but it does.</p>

        <p>This is what America was built on. I am not anti-mask, I’m anti government mask mandate, which I think most of us are. There are definitely times where wearing a mask makes sense, such as when I visit my 96 year old grandmother. But I’m not wearing one at work with a bunch of healthy 20-30 year olds or while I’m outside on a walk... that is ridiculous.</p>

        <p>Are you also anti government seatbelt mandate? 
Seatbelts won’t guarantee your safety, and yet it is a mandate. It does make sense wearing masks around 20-30 year olds, they can still carry the virus and maybe infect their 96 year old grandmother.. what if those young guys have an underlying condition that neither you nor they know about?</p>

        <p>If there weren’t any laws or government mandating them, people wouldn’t follow them. There is a good reason as to why masks are mandatory. Why are you only against government mandated things? Because it restricts your freedom? </p>
<p>I always wear a mask when I am outside of my house or when I am at work (I work at a kindergarten). The situation in Norway is not that serious compared to the U.S. so we have lifted some of the restrictions :)</p>

        <p>Yes you’re right, if there were no laws people wouldn’t follow them. Yes, it restricts freedom. We fought 2 World Wars to protect that freedom, seems people forgot about that. I want as free a society as possible, with as little government as possible. </p>
<p>I’m not in USA, I’m from Canada. We are still in full lockdown over this bs. Have been in full lockdown for over a year. </p>
<p>Wondering if before the pandemic you wore a mask everywhere? Because viruses and sicknesses existed before this all started so it would be selfish if you didn’t wear a mask everywhere before. You would have been transmitting deadly viruses such as the common cold and flu to the elderly without a care.</p>

        <p>Where do you draw the line for freedom then? Should I have the freedom to kill whomever I want? There is a good reason why we have a government for these thhings, they are there to govern us.

<p>No, I did not, since it was not nessecary, because COVID is more dangerouse then the common cold and the flu. Besides that, I was always encouraged to stay home and get better if I had any of the symptomes. It is about caring for others, thats how a society can thrive. In Japan people used masks before COVID was a thing, secondly people can change for the better, such as making it a norm to use a mask when you feel sick and can't stay at home, make it the new normal lol</p>

        <p>I’m not denying government has not function. I believe in the basic libertarian idea of the government soul purpose being protecting our lives (no that does not give them the power to mandate masks) liberty and property. Their functions should be police, military/border security, and upholding the court system. So no I do not believe in anarchy and no you do not have the right to kill anyone. </p>
<p>It shouldn’t matter if covid is more deadly than the flu or a cold. Those still kill people. Mostly elderly people. If you really cared so much about protecting people you would’ve ALWAYS masked up and only left your house for work/groceries. </p>
<p>It’s about finding the balance between normal life and the risks involved in life. Everything you do has a risk. For example every time you get in your car (if you even have them in Norway, isn’t there a ridiculous tax?) you risk killing people. So you should only justify getting in your car if you absolutely have to. But that would be ridiculous. We know there are risks in every aspect of our lives that could harm other people, but we have found the balance in enjoying life, so don’t pretend like now all of a sudden everyone who wear masks are heroic. Life is full of risks. If you’re scared stay home. If you want to live and enjoy normal life then do so with caution since everything is dangerous to one degree or another... not just Covid-19(84)</p>

        <p>Coulnt you argue that mandating mask goes under the goverments purpose of protecting the citizens; or dont you belive that masks works? Glad we could at least agree on that lol</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Yes it does, if the common cold was just as dangerouse as covid, there would be a mandate against that too. Secondly you are judging against somethhing that was normal before, but now is frowned upon. What if wearing a mask if you had thhe common cold was a thing, woulnt that be good? We do care, we just have to learn and correct our ways, just as we have done with other medical practices such as washing your hands :)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Yeah I agree on that, a lot in life is  like that. We do indeed have cars, mostly eletric cars, and yes the tax is ridiculus, but Norway is a welfare state. Talking about the risks of using a car, thats why we have speedlimits, car regulations and so on and on.</p>

        <p>No, my view of the government is extremely basic. If you include masks in what is considered protecting life, you can practically argue all government functions protect life. For example I am Canadian and think our healthcare system sucks and that the government needs to be 100% out of that industry. No libertarians would argue that since healthcare protects life, it’s the governments job to be present in the industry. It really comes down to protecting our rights and freedoms. The governments job is basically to make sure no one else violates my rights, but government can’t violate my rights and freedoms to protect others rights and freedoms, which would be mandating masks. </p>
<p>Well if people actually cared about saving every single life they wouldn’t leave their homes other than for essential purposes. It just isn’t realistic to live your life in fear of every little thing that could harm you or someone else. Speed limits and regulations don’t necessarily solve the problem. Just somewhat reduce it, but again if everyone was so conceded they wouldn’t leave. It just doesn’t make any sense and that’s what we’re experiencing now. People who forgot there have always been risks associated with life, but are now realizing that. So they want to throw away normal life for most people who don’t care.</p>

        <p>I consider mandating a law which helps prevent the spread of a diseas such as covid, is reasonable enough to protect life. </p>
<p>How so? From what I've heard, the Canadian HC is supposed to be good, compared to thhe US lol, but idk, here in Norway it works, and even in Brazil (I was born there) the healthcare service (SUS). But I am a fan of soscialism, and by the looks of your arguments, you sound like a libertarian. So we will have our differences :p</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>People are going to die eitherway, it is just about saving those we can. And you shoul'nt live in fear, especially if you are young, personally, its not about my life, but reather what can I do to help others. Wearing a mask does not hurt you, so far the most irritating thhing about the masks for me is to remeber hhaving one on me. Mask does not prevent 100%, but it is effective enough to save plenty of people if they are combined with other regulations such as social distancing.</p>
<p>Anywho, I appreciate the civil conversation:))</p>

        <p>Our healthcare system is a complete disaster, probably on par with USA though, but very different systems. And I am a libertarian because I believe the free market can provide any product or service at a more affordable, higher quality and more efficiently than any government agency.  I am definitely the exact opposite of a socialist, I believe it’s inherently evil, and the corruption/authoritarian rule that comes along with it scares me. I don’t want the government having that kind of power since over the last 100 years socialism is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of millions of people. </p>
<p>Yeah I’m just not convinced on the mask thing, I’ll wear one when I feel I should wear one, and won’t when I don’t think it’s necessary. We’re all different humans with subjective views on when we should wear masks (another reason I believe in freedom, we’re all different), so I don’t think the government gets to determine everyone’s morals. </p>
<p>Anyways appreciate you not screaming and insulting me, pretty rare these days for two people who disagree to keep it civil and still respect each other. Take care!</p>

        <p>If you dont wear mask around those “healthy” people that you work with, who btw are also dyong from covid, and they get covid they wont come to work and work will suffer from that prolly. Other than that, while they might feel ok, they might still get covid from you since you dont have a mask on and not willingly or knowingly they’ll transmit the virus on to the next person, who might not be so healthy. So stop killing people and being a jackass. Stop the quarantine by not being stupid, just wear a mask. Its not control or power, its just human decency.</p>

        <p>My issue is with mask mandates, not masks. If you have even the slightest knowledge of history you would know giving government power to do anything like force the populous to wear masks is a slippery slope. It’s not the aspect of them making us wear masks that is the issue, it’s the precedent it sets. If one guy can make everyone wear masks then who knows what the next guy will do, hence slippery slope. </p>
<p>And it is absolutely ridiculous to live my life in fear of a virus with over a 99.9% survival rate. Despite what the media will tell you, this virus is actually not deadly to the absolute vast majority of people so why should I wear a mask all the time? I wear a mask when I feel I should, like visiting my grandmother, or when I am around a bunch of strangers and unable to socially distance. I’m not wearing my mask around my coworkers who are all young and healthy. That is ridiculous. Wake up.</p>

        <p>For the slippery slope you're referring to, would some of those issues be things like:</p>
<p>A national ID registry for anyone born within the country.</p>
<p>Requiring a separate ID with your picture and address to use a vehicle.</p>
<p>Requiring yet a third ID to leave and enter the country that contains a record of every country you have been to.</p>
<p>Use a terrorist incident that killed far fewer people than the coronavirus to record every possible electronic interaction you have ever made.</p>
<p>Placing someone in a camp due to their heritage and taking those people's property.</p>
<p>Determining the value of your home and neighborhood based on your skin color.</p>

        <p>I don't agree with some of those either, but the point is that your concern for a slippery slope seems a bit late and arbitrarily applied. The government already has a massive influence on your life, it's all just been normalized. Wearing a mask for a period of time seems fairly trivial when compared to the other things the government does.</p>
<p>The government has already determined it can require people to wear seatbelts and helmets. I struggle to see how a temporary mask mandate is much different.</p>

        <p>I feel like you've changed your argument. Before it was a slippery slope, now it's that were so far down the slope any new thing is also bad. While I understand the desire to prevent power from accumulating, of all the things going on right now this still seems so mundane. </p>
<p>Certain state governments are currently fighting to be able to control women's bodies. Plenty of municipalities have essentially made extra judicial punishment and killings by cops impossible to prosecute. We just had a president who was so nepotistic that it's hard to see where his administration and family/friends didn't overlap. People have sat in Guantanamo Bay for years without ever being charged with a crime.</p>
<p>Are you honestly going to tell me these things scare you less than a temporary mask mandate? Because those things seem like a much bigger issue than wearing a piece of cloth so we don't accidentally kill someone's grandma.</p>

        <p>See in europe, we’re patriotic. So we like taxes and wearing masks, not because the government forces us too but because we’re patriotic about our country and the welfare of others. We wear masks not because its forced but because we want to. We’re the government and we want to wear masks.</p>
<p>Now go read a little more, cause covid doesn’t have a survival rate of 99.9% especially if you’re in america with one fo the worst healthcare systems. You’re actually so wrong that you’re either so ignorant that you trust in facebook posts from karens or you’re just stupid. Covid in american at least, which handled it the worst cause you’re shit at being patriotic and sticking together, has killed so many people, and without a vaccine I’d have killed a lot more. So be greatful that other people could be nice enough to have some decency to care for others than themselves.</p>

        <p>You make a lot of assumptions and let your emotions get the best of you. If you like taxes then you are either benefiting from them or you clearly have zero understanding of economics. Europe is a complete socialist disaster. </p>
<p>I’m actually not American, I’m Canadian and in my province our overall survival rate is 99.2%, however that includes active cases. So when you remove the active cases it’s around 99.9%. Most places in the word are above 97%. </p>
<p>You are right America’s healthcare system is a disaster. They need more privatization and less government intervention. Government keeps driving up the prices through programs like Medicare and Medicaid and insurance mandates. 50 years ago they had undoubtedly the best healthcare system in the world. Now they’re on par with our awful system in Canada or your system over in Europe. </p>
<p>I partly agree with your last point as it’s quite a generalization. You can’t really say America’s covid response because each states response was vastly different. States like California and New York handled it awfully. They locked down for almost a year. Completely destroyed their economy, shot up their debt, destroyed the mental health of their citizens, closed down businesses, lost record high jobs, while still having high cases and death count. However states like Texas and Florida did an amazing job. Florida’s economy is basically unharmed, probably the least economically impacted of all states. They were allowed to continue normal life so their people remained in good mental well-being, unlikely the skyrocketing depression and suicide rates we see in California. Florida was the extreme of staying open and California was the extreme of staying closed. Their cases and deaths are very similar on a per capita basis. So yes most of America did a horrible job, the states with more restrictions and lockdowns did far worse. States like Florida and Texas did much better.</p>

        <p>You also make assumptions, after doing a little research, you’ll very easily see that the death rate was a lot higher. Ie it might be 99.9 right now but thats after lockdown masks and so on was introduced. As another user also politely pointed out. Europe might be, in your eyes at least, a complete disaster but at least in northern europe where im from it really doesn’t feel like one. Also, when you take into account that smaller provinces with a lot more area and a lot less people per square km then the death rate also falls because of the population density. So assuming that we dont all live in smaller urban areas or non urban areas and in bigger cities with mass populations then the numbers change a lot.  And calling at least our healthcare system bad is just a gross mistake since we somehow manage to do a lot of things here that would be a disaster to do in your countries.</p>

        <p>Canada and a lot Europe basically have the same shitty universal healthcare system. No matter what country single payer/government sponsorship over anything is always a complete disaster. Prices are driven up, wait times are ridiculously high, technology is old, there is no incentive to do better because the government guarantees everything. Open up any economics textbook in the world and it will tell you the free market can provide healthcare at a much cheaper, more efficient, and higher level than any government agency, achieved through basic supply and demand.</p>

        <p>I dont think you realise, but germany has a fully privatized healthcare system? Like i pay 40 bucks a month to a private company to ensure my health. I can go to the doctor and call an ambulance all the same for free, in debmark its even better since its not privatized but still somehow manages to be one of tge best in europe. Now france? Golden standard. Its government owned an is one of the best in the world, so you can generalize something you didnt read up on. Do a little research, and then you’ll actually find out how shitty the american system is, i dont know About the canadian one tbh so thats why im not bringing it up. Also if you mention the uk i will have to call you stupid lol, they have free healthcare but are really just an example of bad public healthcare, porbably what you’re refering to when you say the european standard? Or whatever you said</p>

        <p>If you think that in any way public systems are better than private you need a serious economics lesson. There is not a single economist or economic textbook that will tell you otherwise. Government can’t match the efficiency of the free market. It has never been done and it never will be. </p>
<p>I’ve already said the American system isn’t good. The current American system isn’t a free market system. It’s basically the  same as any other country, government guarantees loans and financial aid through programs like Medicare and Medicaid. That’s why the price is so high, because it’s basically a single payer system. There is no competition and no incentive. When government guarantees payments the healthcare industry will shoot their prices up because they know people have no other choice since there is no competition. </p>
<p>The American system was without doubt the best system in the world 50 or so years ago. It was the cheapest system, lowest wait times, highest survival rates, best technology, lead the word in innovation, produced the most drugs, and so much more I could mention. What changed? Government. That was back when it was a completely private system. Same thing with college education. The quality and prices are only ridiculous because of government intervention. Basic economics and supply and demand will tell you that. You do some research on economics. Once you understand economics you’ll understand why government can’t match anything in the free market. The government is a monopoly. Monopolies are disastrous to the economy. Try and find an economist that would agree with your points. You’re brainwashed. Learn to think for yourself.</p>

        <p>You say that, yet somehow we in denmark and other countries in europe like france have a working system with very little wait times and very low mortality rates. Now we in denmark have a complete free educational system, so free in fact that i get paid over 1000$ a month to study my bachelor, money i don’t have to pay back. Money thats government funded but still somehow manages to not be bad. So maybe it can be done? Or maybe we just got lucky here in Denmark. Or just maybe, america really is that bad at anything private or non private right now.</p>

        <p>No you’re wrong. The systems can still work when they’re government funded, they just won’t be any good. It’s not possible. Check out literally anything ever written by Milton Friedman, probably the most well known and respected economist of all time. He will tell you that you’re wrong. It is a generally accepted theory in economics. You are wrong. I bet you think socialism is better system than capitalism too hahah. Brainwashed. Think for yourself. Educate yourself.</p>

        <p>We have to find the balance between normal life and living in fear of this virus. Neither extremes are necessarily good, but now that we know this virus isn’t anywhere close to as deadly as we once thought, we can lean further on the normal life side. With your logic we should’ve always been wearing masks as viruses have always been a thing and have always targeted older people.</p>

        <p>Yeah so I assume before this whole pandemic you wore a mask everywhere you went for your whole life. Right? Because sicknesses and viruses have always existed and disproportionately targeted old people while being spread by young people. So am I right to assume you wore a mask everywhere you went before this all started? Haha yeah right, you’re selfish. </p>
<p>This is about finding the balance between normal life and protecting people. I’m not falling to either extreme.</p>
