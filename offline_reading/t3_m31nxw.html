    <strong>I spoke to my grandma today</strong>
    <p><p>I didn't know what to expect but she was surprisingly based. To begin with she was talking about how bad lockdown was. Not coronavirus. Lockdown. And how it must be having a terrible effect on children, the full effects of which won't be seen for a while. And how hard it must be for young people who were expecting to go to university or enter the workforce.  </p>
<p>She acknowledges that coronavirus is a real thing, but she's not selfish, and clearly cares about the impact this is having on the young. It was really heartening hearing how much she cares about our future in 20 years time, even though she knows she won't be here.  </p>
<p>Just thought I'd share to show that some older people are concerned about what's going on</p></p>

        <p>No one asked seniors if they wanted to be isolated and locked away, but government did it anyway, as the 1930s Germans said, "for their safety."</p>

        <p>Personally, my grandmother goes about her life as normal as she can. Not at all concerned about the virus, and believes that the shutting down of society is insane. Absolutely loathes the mask mandates. I'm very fortunate that everyone that I'm even relatively close to in my family shares these beliefs and values.</p>

        <p>No same or decent elder would wish away the freedom of others... Especially the young for their own "safety"</p>
