    <strong>Victim culture: when did it begin, and how is today the natural progression of that change.</strong>
    <p><p>I believe today is the natural progression of a victim culture that begin at some point in the recent past.  COVId became a calling card for the part of America that wants to be a victim of something.  Trump being elected in 2016 exposed the kind of victim culture that took a step above just being underemployed or underpaid, according to the “victimized”.  The real beginning to me was around 2008-2009, with the financial crisis, and social media debate around who or what was to blame. I suppose the roots of victim culture go back even further, with the proliferation of victims rights attorneys all over your local television stations and highway billboards.  This would trace back into the very late 90’s.</p>
<p>I’m here to debate this as a part of the “normal” we are seeing right now.  There is a huge swath of the American public, and perhaps other countries, who spend their every waking hour watching doom and gloom on tv, in the form of news broadcasts, true crime documentaries on demand, and commercialization of our overly litigious society.  These people want to be a victim of something, and COVId has raised their status. They get unlimited television and internet attention.  Accolades from others for being a “victim”.  </p>
<p>I’m sick of it.  To me, it represents a helpless society, who in actuality, is living through the most affluent time in human history.  Grateful for nothing, and unwilling to pursue achievement or success on their own.  Everyone who caters to this mentality is an enabler, the same way a opioid addict is enabled by big pharmaceutical, and that connection isn’t just ironic.</p>
<p>End rant.</p></p>

        <p>Narcissism, egocentric people who enjoy control of others. What do you call that personality type? I've seen it in my family, most of the people in my family behave this way. They can't allow others to have an opinion that's not theirs, and get angry and attack if someone is "smarter" than them, or put in the spotlight. It needs to be about them. </p>
<p>On the flip side you have what people call "empaths" who can, and try to see other's point of view, and readily put others feelings ahead of theirs, to make others comfortable. </p>
<p>As far as history goes... I think people changed a lot after the second world war. People moved off their farm land, and urbanized, which in it's self is a sort of individualized lifestyle, where as on a family farm everyone works together, and gov. Is less involved in their lives.</p>
<p>Also, with women no longer wanting families, wanting to work, and being EXPECTED to work (Fyi I'm a woman, this is not sextist), Hollywood and glam magazines helped people to individualize, feel the need to show off and consume for the self instead of building a family estate where generations lived. How many of us can say "the family farm, estate, home etc.?" I know I can't. Just my long winded thought process.</p>

        <p>Great points.  My theory on victim culture may go much further back, it’s just that it was an individual decision to be a victim before the advent of social media, and before tv started to seemingly CELEBRATE it.  Almost like an award system.  And now, virtue signaling makes it seem like being a victim is some kind of card to be celebrated, by itself.</p>
<p>This country is probably half full now of people who feel someone did something wrong to them.  It’s divided very clearly down some kind of political party lean, when the truth is that the system that exists is held up by any and all political parties.  </p>
<p>I don’t often side with one politician, Elizabeth Warren, but her thoughts on why the cost of living is so challenging due to the average working class household going from one working parent to both parents WANTING to work, then NEEDING to work, and the need for a second automobile, sort of building the foundation on the cultural struggles we see today, are deep and intelligent.  </p>
<p>Thanks again for intelligent comments.  Victim culture may go back further than I can imagine, but it seems to me to have become “viral”, sometime just over a decade ago.  Now, we have a desperate, divided situation.</p>

        <p>One of the biggest proliferators of the victim mentality is the spread of critical social theory that gets pushed down people's throats, especially in colleges. It incentivises being a victim--if you check the boxes of the most victim categories, your opinion is more important than the opinion of those with more "privilege."</p>

        <p>Very well put. If you’ve never read Industrial Society and its Future, there is a section in which the author explains how the need to feel like a victim is a core value of leftist ideology. It was published in 1995.</p>
<p>The writing as a whole is an increasingly accurate reflection and prediction of the world we are living in.</p>

        <p>The issue is that I think our default was once so good that now we are inventive of problems. Yes, there are homeless, people struggling in all facets of life - but the baseline average seems to be the highest it has ever been.   </p>
<p>This is particularly why the word PROGRESS is being redefined and used to label ridiculous, hyper specific accomplishments. First X in office, First X to be elected to said position.  </p>
<p>I see it all of the time and do not understand how others think this is progress when it is totally contrived and done just to pander.</p>
