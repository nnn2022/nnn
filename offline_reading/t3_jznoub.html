    <strong>You should be in Hollywood! You'd make a great actress!</strong>
    <p><p>So, I came up with a great line to lighten the mood and inform!</p>
<p>I've used it TWO times.  Once at a grocery store, the other at a Container Store - Seattle suburb area.</p>
<p>They both involved checkout girls.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>1) Groc Store - I didn't see her doing it, but I think she did it earlier - you know when checkout people are forced to wipe down the surface of the checkout lane. [They do this at Walmart]</p>
<p>We call that HYGIENE THEATER.  A Theater ---&rt; actors / actresses.</p>
<p>I gave her the line in the title and she hesitated for a moment...guessing her ability to think fast was compromised by wearing a mask for many hours. Then I said something like "because it's pretty much useless, hygiene theater" -- and then she stated she had read something about that, how it spreads through air more, not surfaces. </p>
<p>She didn't laugh, but then masks do affect our emotional state. And if she smiled - I couldn't see it!</p>
<p>2) Container Store - I saw her wipe down the counter in front of me, like a dutiful employee. I mentioned the whole HYGIENE THEATER thing and she had never heard of it!  </p>
<p>But maybe she will look it up when she gets home!</p></p>

        <p>I wouldn't harass minimum wage employees at work. They didn't come up with this crap and are just trying to do their job (and now this additional job on top of their normal job which they aren't getting paid any more money to do.)</p>

        <p>Agreed. I have had a job where I had to strictly enforce masks and a bunch of other bullshit, and I hated having to tell clients what to do more than actually wearing the damn thing</p>

        <p>educating them....not harassing them. Making a joke...</p>
<p>It's in the intonation of the voice and facial expression...oh that can't see the latter.</p>
<p>I have to clean surfaces at my workplace as we rotate computers.</p>
<p>The one-ways are going where I live...now time to get rid of all this spraying.</p>

        <p>They're probably just as miserable (if not more) than the rest of us... I will only say something if they get snarky about it. For example, if I use a wipe for the shopping cart handle (which I have done since way before covid) and the employee tells me it's been wiped down and to not use a new wipe, I'll look at their disgusting rag and ask, "was it wiped down with that?" I usually get a blank stare. Another favorite star of Hygiene Theater: the soggy rag used on hundreds of carts.</p>
