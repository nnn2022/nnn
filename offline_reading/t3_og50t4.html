    <strong>It's a social experiment</strong>
    <p><p>I have a friend who has asthma and has been worried since the beginning of the pandemic about catching the virus. Recently she did an antibody blood test, and discovered that she actually has antibodies, although throughout that whole thing she didn't know that she had the virus at any certain time because she didn't have symptoms. Even after that, she still panicks from virus and was desperate to take the vaccine, although she literally had the virus and it didn't even affect her. Moreover,  almost all the people that I know, know that I and plenty of other people they know, had the virus but barely had any symptoms or the symptoms were just as any influenza, but they still freak the f*** out when you talk about this issue.</p>
<p>When you have a 24/7 media, from TV to social media that keeps brainwashing you and feeding you fear and anxiety, you literally lose track of your reality and start denying it.</p></p>

        <p>It's a coronavirus.</p>
<p>Most people had antibodies analogous enough to combat covid-19 from the common cold which mutates year on year. If it's close enough, it will work.</p>
<p>Nature is very efficient at equipping organisms with a dynamic immune system that can use previous infections for new slightly different ones.</p>

        <p>My sister has the antibodies too and she never knew she had the virus. Her kids and hubby however did not have them. Which is weird. But it could be a time frame thing. I know families that had the pcr  test and some had the virus and others didnâ€™t . Makes me think that the pcr test is a bunch of crap and this virus isnâ€™t as contagious as they say or the test for covid is rigged. I know If you go donate blood they used to test for antibodies. Do a web search for covid antibody tests. There are a bunch of sites. Lab Corp is one of them. Just not as many locations. My sister went to her doctor and had hers done.</p>

        <p>Three people at my work tested positive with zero symptoms and zero idea they had covid. Three different people had to go off sick after getting vaccinated.. for the same illness that three other people had, and only went off sick because they were forced to after testing positive for a test they were forced to take, even though they had no symptoms... ðŸ¤¡ðŸŒŽ</p>

        <p>This virus is weak dude. I also had it and didn't realize. I think that antibody testing should be free like the other tests, and vaccine should only be recommended for those who don't have the antibodies, and that's only after it's been thoroughly tested... But alas, these are the musings of a sane person in a world gone mad</p>
