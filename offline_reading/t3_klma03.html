    <strong>Doomers have taken so much from me</strong>
    <p><p>I’m a teenager and I’m not the most outgoing but before covid I hung out with people. I had friends who went to my house and I went to their houses and we watched movies and went camping and did regular teenager stuff. I wasn’t a partier or someone who was out every day. But I went out. I had a life. I went to concerts sometimes and I went to festivals and I went studying with my friends. I had so much fun and, as my mom put it, was really becoming my own person. </p>
<p>Now I’ve barely seen these people for months. And that’s with breaking the rules to hang out with the few people i know who will. I’ve lost so much culture like small indie bands playing and eating from food trucks that have probably closed. I’ve lost a year of my youth to this bullshit and I know I can still do stuff in my adult years but this is still life that I’m never getting back thanks to the flu. even if we went back to normal TODAY things would still never be really normal. Stores would be closed and memories with friends I could have had would still have never happened. </p>
<p>It just makes me so sad to see so much life and vibrancy gone. Recently I started watching concert recordings on YouTube and pretending that I was there because I was so lonely at home, which is literally insane lmao. I talk to my parents and siblings and we hang out and do stuff but it IS NOT THE SAME AS HANGING OUT WITH PEOPLE MY AGE. I’m a normal person but I can feel myself getting weird and withdrawn and dumber with every day spent at home. I feel like I can never really speak to people my age again, knowing that they were willing to give up their lives for this bullshit. </p>
<p>I don’t know what to say. I’m thankful you guys are standing up for what you believe in and I love this sub so much but it’s such a weird thing to become an adult in the middle of all this dumb shit. I feel like I’ve wasted so much potential just sitting at home doing online school in my room by myself. </p>
<p>I’m not even depressed about it and I don’t really want a suicide hotline from a dumbass doomer because I wouldn’t ever kill myself and I’m not mentally ill for thinking this is ridiculous. I just know when I’m an adult I will be so pissed for my teenage self. Thanks for reading this, and I really do appreciate this sub. People here are so rational and smart. It’s very inspirational.</p>
<p>Edit: thanks for all the nice comments I really appreciate them! :)</p></p>

        <p>Yeah man it’s bullshit. I’m 32 and if this were happening when I was a teenager I think we would be rioting. Just try and find other people your age who agree with you.</p>

        <p>Thanks. My parents have been very strict lately (not because of the virus but because they don’t want me to be in legal trouble or stuck paying fines) but my best friend is also not insane which helps. It’s just weird that 99% of teenagers don’t give a shit.</p>

        <p>It seems like your generation is very obedient, it’s a bit weird. Too trusting in government. Kids were already borderline autistic and antisocial and just staring at their phones all day and I worry this has made that way of life acceptable</p>

        <p>Not all autistics are like that.  Mine’s not.  But then the doctors could be full of it in my son’s case.   He was non verbal for years.  When he started talking it was in full paragraphs.  Sooo logical.  He’s become better because he hangs with techies.  Non crazy techies.</p>

        <p>A lot of kids today grew up with authorities like Instagram or Twitter having much more control in their lives than their own parents. These website/apps control their image, reputation and their socializing, I'm not surprised that most teens are extremely obedient</p>

        <p>Remember the school walkouts over immigration etc a couple years back?  Seems the dems put a lot of stock in what teens do.  They want to allow them to vote etc.</p>

        <p>I hear you, it shouldn’t be happening, just remember that it’s not because of a virus, it is because of the Media and the government and all their combined propaganda. Always remember what an insanely effective tool propaganda is on the majority of society. </p>
<p>I know you have lost a precious year in a really important time of your life, and while you can’t get it back, maybe the next 5 years will end up awesome enough to make up for it somewhat.</p>

        <p>Until you realize that it will take six months for any return to normal until have stupid amounts of fun. Because every event until the summer is canceled. People need to prepare again, plan again because a whole year destroyed and regrssed their skills.</p>
<p>The next 5 years will not be fun. People like OP will be paying for society decisions for decades, physically, mentally, socially, and psychologically.</p>
<p>There places closed forever, opportunities gone forever. Even if these lockdowns are done NOW, there wont be a old normal for at least 6 months since every planned event is canceled or turned into a glorified livestream.</p>
<p>In some cases you are going have to temporarily relocate to a free state because the area you may be living in now has been decimated.</p>

        <p>I am so sorry. I have 2 food trucks that worked around my state at festivals, concerts, races, rodeos, etc. and although it sucks that we are shut down, I have really been thinking about the attendees, the teens, 4-H kids, cowboys, racecar drivers, performers, spectators that used to be our customers. </p>
<p>There is nothing like getting together for a common interest. Seeing live performances, celebrating together, having fun, enjoying the culture, learning new things. </p>
<p>It’s absolutely heart wrenching that it’s not possible anymore. —and it’s even worse to hear that these things still might not be possible even after mass vaccination. I dont know what to make of it all. Because, is a life without joy even a life worth living? </p>
<p>Of course I don’t want anyone to die of coronavirus. But I feel like this is going on for so long, that we are destroying the spirit of humanity along with it. I know I sound pessimistic, but it’s how I feel. I am by nature a very community minded and social person. It’s destroying me to stay home, and just “trust the experts” to tell me when it’s ok to gather again. </p>
<p>I guess all I’m saying is, I understand. This sucks, I don’t have the answers, but I feel you. continue to see the friends that you are able to, and hang in there. If things don’t start to change soon, then we, as a society will have to reassess what is really important. &lt;3</p>

        <p>You just expressed my feelings better than I ever could. For us social people this is soul breaking. I have friends who have always been homebodies and enjoyed solitary hobbies and they're having the time of their lives. As someone who used to go out all the time, every day of my life is boring and just blending into the next day and the next with no meaning since this whole sh*tshow started.</p>

        <p>Thank you for sharing your feelings and thoughts. I'm so sorry you are going through this as a teenager. Just know you're not the only angry one and here we all feel robbed of our livelihood and experiences. </p>
<p>I'm nearing my 30s. I lost a good chunk of my 20s in an abusive relationship that I got out of in 2018 and it took me the whole year of 2019 to start healing. I was finally on a good path at the beginning of 2020 and now I'm back to my old addictions and utter daily boredom and lack of motivation. I just don't see the light at the end of the tunnel and reasons to look forward to anything anymore...</p>
<p>Stay strong. Try to get through to as many of your peers as you can.</p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing how you feel. It makes me so angry to hear stories like yours. Those who advocate perpetual lockdowns give no weight to the sacrifices you are making in your own life even though the virus poses no risk to you at all. It’s as if letting an 82 year old live a few extra months is worth you having no life to live.</p>
<p>Your comment about feeling like you are getting weird is something that will resonate with many. I personally feel like my social skills have regressed even as a 36 year old and it is going to take effort to build deep connections again with people when that becomes possible. I have friends and see people from work on Zoom etc but it is all just so fake and awkward.</p>

        <p>Zoom has been so bad for me socially because it’s not even socialization but people apparently think it’s good enough to be. I spend way too much time with my younger siblings now, which has made me kind of immature. I agree that it’s gonna take so much effort to connect with others again, especially if they went along with covid. Thanks for the comment btw!</p>

        <p>I feel pretty much exactly like you. I’m in my early 20s and I was just telling this to my mom. She’s been brainwashed by the news so she believes in all this bullshit. When she was arguing with me about covid and how I “don’t think it’s real” (It’s real just not even close to what it’s hyped up to be) I said to her how it’s easy for her because she got to live freely in her youth but I should be starting my own life and I can’t. I can’t go out, meet anyone, I definitely can’t get a job in this world, and I can’t move out. It’s like we’re expected to just live like we’re retired when we haven’t even gotten started. Even if I were to go out, there’s nothing to do. I’m not depressed, I’m just bored and fed up with this shit.</p>

        <p>I must say, it will get get harder to make friends irl if you hang out online in places like that. You should tell your story to more mainstream subs like r/teenagers. Maybe not all of them will agree with you but at least you'll be able to discuss and exchange with people of your own age.</p>
