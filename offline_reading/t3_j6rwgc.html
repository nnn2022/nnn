        <p>It feels like screaming into a void at this point.</p>
<p>Nothing is going to make these people budge. No amount of evidence or research, medical or otherwise, seems to be "enough". </p>
<p>At this point, it will take a massive revolt to get the government to back off, and sadly, there just aren't enough of us to initiate the necessary change.</p>

        <p>Well, even if all 9,000+ members of this sub got together in one spot, it wouldn't be enough for meaningful change. We'd need to do several protests over several weeks, and of the same magnitude of the BLM protests with hundreds of thousands of people. Oh, and this needs to happen all over the world, not just one country.</p>

        <p>They Jews just burned their masks in NY, I'm sure there are many more that aren't accounted for by our sub alone. we just need a way to reach all of them. I feel that some momentum is being built, of course the media will continue to demonize us though.</p>

        <p>The Jewish community has been the most resistant to all this nonsense, more than any other religious group that I know of. Especially the citizens of NY and NJ (thus why I am very <strong>pissed</strong> when I see people here shit on those states). </p>
<p>There's been rebellion going on since March, it's just too small scale for the elites to actually be afraid of. This is why we need more big protests, similar to BLM and to the one that happened in Berlin a while back. If we had protests like that going on all over the world, that would put much more fear onto the government, I imagine.</p>

        <p>I've never been one to make sweeping generalizations like that. I have no contempt for the individuals in those states who are willing to have a back bone and stand up against the rising insanity. I so desperately want some one else to start because i don't have the back bone my self to make a stand.</p>

        <p>I know you haven't, but I am seeing an increase in hateful comments and posts about NY and NJ (and other blue states like CA but to a lesser extent), even though there's people in those states who are also against the "New Normal". </p>
<p>It feels like people want to turn this into an exclusive clubhouse that only "desirables" can join, while the rest of the people they hate, whether boomers, fatties, New Yorkers, work from home workers, etc are being told to "fuck off and die". The hypocrisy I see here and at LDS really sickens me. Why? Because we really aren't in a position to ridicule and exclude others who can be allies to us. This group is already splintered as fuck, and this behavior is only making it worse.</p>

        <p>I agree, I mean I haven’t seen a bunch of comments personally. </p>
<p>I think it’s easy for some ppl to forget that sometimes ppl are trapped in places, whether they agree with what is going on or not. I think they feel like a lot of ppl in NY, NJ and CALI are there bc they want to be. </p>
<p>When they see ppl who go against the tyranny they will obviously support them.</p>

        <p>I tried to leave but I got a job offer, so I stayed. It was either give up my career trajectory, everything I've worked for, and move in with family, or attempt to retain my independence while putting up with the b.s. I chose this, but it's far from ideal. Some people on the coasts are stuck with this nonsense due to work and family obligations. </p>
<p>Its hard but I'm trying to find based people here to hang out with.</p>

        <p>I sympathize with you, man. Many of us have had to make tough choices like that. Don't let anyone shame you into believing you made the wrong decision.</p>
<p>Also for /u/SSDD4287: </p>
<p>&rt; I think it’s easy for some ppl to forget that sometimes ppl are trapped in places, whether they agree with what is going on or not. I think they feel like a lot of ppl in NY, NJ and CALI are there bc they want to be.</p>
<p>Yes, I think this is a part of it, but it's still very shortsighted and insensitive to make that sweeping generalization. It's also why I get annoyed when I see people say "move" whenever people express frustrations with their mask/New Normal crazy states. I wish I could flee PA because it is becoming hell, but I simply don't have the means or money at all. I'd love to get a ton of money, and use that to fund a move to somewhere like South Dakota, but that's just not going to happen anytime soon unless I win the lottery or something.</p>

        <p>I think it will reach a certain crescendo of insanity then collapse of it's own overreach that will even turn off the masses, like the great witch possession terrors did hundreds of years ago, or the red scare communist witch hunts did in the US in the 50s. A form of mass insanity. It's emotional not rational for the afflicted, that's why data and facts have no effect. But the extreme effects will eventually move people to sanity when the suffering hits them emotionally.</p>

        <p>But it's just like wearing clothes. It's not a big deal that you just have to wear another piece of clothing. And it's all about saving lives, you selfish, ignorant, science-denying, alt-right imbeciles! </p>
<p>I don't know what is more enraging and disgusting...the reeking sanctimonious bullshit and virtue-signaling...how all of a sudden they love to claim how much they care about "saving lives" and act like this virus is a horrible plague. Or how easily these morons were literally programmed overnight. Going from never even haven given a single thought to wearing masks... to being psychotically obsessed with masks, thinking it's just as socially normal as wearing clothes, and being adamant that this all totally normal and necessary and they have always held this belief, and wearing masks is what intellectually and morally superior people do. I think the most horrifying part has to be how mindless the vast majority of people are and how Orwellian programming is real and so easily implemented. The fact that they cannot understand the many, many solid and valid reasons why anyone would be opposed to  masks is extremely disturbing and reeks of fascism and dystopia. And of course the big pink elephant in the room...that this is a 0.15% IFR virus that "kills" people who are already at death's door. Nope, these psychotic cultists continue gleefully destroying every facet of society for a glorified cold virus and continue patting themselves on the back for what selfless, compassionate heroes they are.</p>
