    <strong>LAX Airport 10/10 Absurdity and In Door Dining Back Fire.</strong>
    <p><p>Talked to some friends about this, thought I'd post here for everyone to get a laugh at the pure non-sense going on. I was connecting in LAX(Been flying a lot, like pre-covid levels since Aug.) Anyways so in either California or just LA there is a "No indoor dining ban" but you can technically have take out. So some the little restaurants and food places in the LAX airport are open but they don't have seating in their designated area. Same with the lounges you have to take food out and eat in the public seating area.  </p>
<p>So take out basically means go to your gate or anywhere within the vicinity and eat your food there. So all this stupid restriction has done is limit seating and increase the density of where people are located with their masks off. On top of that not only did it eliminate the area where people would eat with their masks off together. Now it is mixing people who are just traveling and might be at high risk. Are now exposed more than ever because people are having to go to their gate and eat with regular travelers. So many of these stupid laws meant to stop the spread seem to just do the opposite.</p></p>
