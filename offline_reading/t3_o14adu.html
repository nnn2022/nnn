    <strong>Never talk to me about mental health or climate change EVER again</strong>
    <p><p>Not after you squealing little fuckers stopped caring about either in the face of a fucking pussy meme virus with a 99.9% survival rate. Everyone's mental health is FUCKED now. Mountains of disposable masks have been carelessly thrown out, damaging the environment. You absolute hypocrites. The media's already dialling up the fear about climate change. I never really took any notice before all this but fucking hell, once you see it you can't unsee it. Fucking propaganda out the arse.</p>
<p>Not to get too personal but I've had problems with anxiety and depression in the past (who fucking hasn't?) but it really feels like you miserable arseholes have just dragged down everyone to your level because of your crippling social anxiety and self-diagnosed mental illnesses. You certainly flattened the curve there, alright. Now everyone's fucking tired and miserable and anxious. Well, everyone except those in charge, of course.</p></p>

        <p>Exactly!! The mental health implications that people have endured are gonna have an everlasting effect on us all. All for a plandemic using the FLU as the culprit! And as far as the medias narrative about climate change and everything else fear related...you are 100% right!!! Once you see it, you cannot unsee it!!</p>

        <p>Alright, I'm open to the idea, but I dont understand why people decide to adopt indefensible theories like world depopulation regarding covid.</p>
<p>If they were going to depopulate the world with a man made virus/vaccine combo and get rich(er) in the process, it would make a lot more sense to use a deadlier virus so that a 24/7 fear mongering disinfo campaign wouldn't be necessary to convince people to get the jab. It's neadlessly inefficient and obtuse.</p>
<p>Never mind that there's plenty of evidence of money and power grabs, but the only evidence of a mass depopulation effort is cracked pots and tinfoil hats.</p>

        <p>The MSM is censoring everything to do with death and adverse effects from the v^××!ne!! Say what you will, but when they censor everything against the covid narrative for over a year, that right there isn't a conspiracy theory. So why censor Ivermectin and HCQ so hard? Why can't we talk about the deaths related to the vaccine?</p>

<p>When I got my first and second shot, I felt nothing. Some of my friends felt like shit after getting one of the shots, but literally nobody had any serious side effects. And I work in the hospitality industry, so I talk to a LOT of people on a daily basis.</p>

        <p>I don't think "they"- some global cult--I think CHINA is trying to depopulate their enemies. There's only one reason HIV was spliced into a coronavirus. The virus isn't deadly...yet, but partially effective vaccines given in the midst of a pandemic is the way you create many many mutations. One of the mutations will be a aiborne version of HIV. And the jabs people are getting outside of China make antiretrovirals ineffective by blocking access to the spike proteins. Interesting that China makes its doctors that handle COVID patients take AIDS medication.</p>

        <p>The problem with that is a deadlier virus runs out of hosts far quicker.  Viruses live to infect, so if they run out of hosts they die too.  Also, can be tougher to control.</p>
<p>Some time ago I read a paper on this - and the conclusion was that a virus that would infect repeatedly by mutating and taking its time to do so would be far more efficient at taking out large pockets of the population. </p>
<p>Don't forget too, some of this may well have to do with control - as long as it can be milked by TPTB, they'll be patient.  Look at the markets - the transfer of wealth is making some people considerably richer because in general, people still have hope to return to normalcy.  People are building homes, starting jobs, buying cars, etc.  Something that runs rampant through the population and wipes out half of it quickly isn't going to get them as rich.</p>

        <p>Not that I'm a huge fan of depop theory, but:</p>
<ol>
<li>The elites don't need us to own anything, they just need to carve it up between themselves. </li>
</ol>
<p>Kings and nobles have done just fine owning everything in the past. We know that structure works.</p>
<pre><code>If we look at somewhere like North Korea there's no ownership outside of the aristocracy. The entire country effectively runs off government scrip.

The world has been off gold standard for a very long time. All our money is imaginary at this point. Even proles are turning electricity into money with crypto mining. None of this is real, and if it is just *agreed* then the governments can make up any rules they like.
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What are people <em>really</em> essential for?</p>
<p>We are at the dawn of viable automation. Both robots and machine learning are good enough to start taking out massive chunks of the employed. Every day more and more human roles will replaced by machines. </p>
<p>The only role that will never be taken from humans by elites is as simple as it is awful: only humans can feel. We know exactly what elites do to people for fun, how much they enjoy inflicting pain, raping people, killing, etc. The last humans won't be cattle, they'll be prey.</p>

        <p>The finiancialized capitalist economic model requires endless growth to sustain itself.  But birth rates are dropping across the West.  The world population is going to hit a high water mark by mid-century and then recede.  Corporate feudalism is the post-growth model that they've decided to transition the world to.  In the deflationary future, all value will be funneled upwards and that will be that.  Serfs like us will own nothing and be told by the TV and social media bots that we're happy.</p>

        <p>They tell you everyday, The New Normal is not just a moniker to these people, it’s entirety. </p>
<p>It’s a new system, built on the cannibalized knowledge of the real human history/existence/experience and presented back to people like something new. These people create nothing. It will be and is entirely skewed to encoding/invoking the “New” man. Anything man alters in himself these people consider enacting their “will” upon, and by people’s oblivious submission, their new “creation”. </p>
<p>If you don’t believe in God, sad news, these people entirely do and act by this knowledge.</p>

        <p>I actually thought I was going to lose my mind the other day when a bunch of overweight people were mask free and I was the youngest and presumably healthiest person who had to wear the mask since I’m not vaxxed. I didn’t make a big deal about it since I was volunteering with the elderly but I think it really is meant to break us since I makes NO SENSE!!!!</p>

        <p>To think they have the audacity to call anyone who isn't in absolute compliance "selfish" for having a small party with friends, or god forbid, travelling! when pre-covid they would go on about how much they care about mental health in a big spiel. Now they're all "well, it's been hard for EVERYONE, not just you. What makes YOU so special you can't comply with the only one person outside your household"? Like they don't see how destructive the "measures" are to mental health. The same people also claim we must do all this to protect 'public health' when they don't see how these terrible measures are trashing public health by causing increases in other issues like alcoholism and drug abuse. Spot on my man.</p>

        <p>Screw that, I did not change a single thing about my day to day routine throughout this entire thing.  Yeah, wore a mask when it was required for going into stores etc, but other than that there was not one time where I said "oh I'll just stay home because of corona". I work in a business that goes into peoples homes - usually 5-8 different houses per day. I have 10 techs, only 2 ever tested positive - one get tested because he had a light fever and the other was his roommate, they both said they didn't really have any symptoms and were really bored for 2 weeks. The other office in the state has 18 techs and only one lost time due to covid - he didn't get it but his girlfriend did to he had to quarantine.   You would think that nearly 30 techs, going into 5-8 homes per day, 6 days a week, we would have seen more people getting sick, but only 3.   We did have a manager that kept having family members test positive, but I think he was using corona as a means to get free paid time off. </p>
<p>I know for a lot of people they had no choice, workplaces closed down, forced lockdowns etc and I really feel for them - I couldn't imagine being stuck at home.  I remember reading about the UK where you could only go outside and exercise for an hour a day? What the hell is that, its like being in solitary in prison!  I will say that I do mostly outdoor activities so bars and restaurants closing really didn't matter much to me they didn't close any hiking trails!</p>

        <p>Same here. Didn't give a flying fuck. The first week they scared the crap out of me when I read on Wiki about it but I figured out real quick the bullshit behind it.      </p>
<p>Since then I've been doing whatever I wanted to do and whenever. Lockdowns and curfews were nonexistent to me. Illegal in the first place, I'd have fought a fine with teeth and claws in court in addition to suing the officer handing it out.</p>

        <p>You can share an actual scientific paper with them, showing that if one lives with an asymptomatic person, their chances of getting infected are around 0.7% and they'll still call you a murderer. And what's worse, they'll beg the government to relocate you to a quarantine and reeducation facility indefinitely if you don't want to produce a vaccine passport.</p>

<p>They have completely wrecked my mental health for something I've never even had and they still have the nerve to call themselves compassionate and caring. How am I guilty and getting so much abuse for something I've never even done? Ex convicts get more sympathy than our crowd.</p>

        <p>Climate change isn't a hoax in of itself it's just a 9/11 esque crisis that can be milked for much longer.</p>
<p>There is undeniable evidence humans increase greenhouse gasses, and undeniable evidence greenhouse gasses increase the temperature of the earth.</p>
<p>There is also undeniable evidence that we are averaging up in temperature faster than recorded history.</p>
<p>The catch is that other shit we're doing to the planet ecologically will kill us before climate change by a long shot. The food chain is basically destroyed due to the lack of insects at the base, and mercury and microplastics fucking up the oceanic food chain.</p>
<p>Food scarcity will hit us long before climate change kills us.</p>

        <p>yes, he won the most votes in history, 80 millions votes, more than obama because we all know how popular his 80s crime bill is to black folks.</p>
<p>in fact he got soo much votes that nc, mi, ga, pa, and others places took a week or even two to count all the mailed in ballots for him. a first in history.</p>
<p>he also made history as flipping from a losing position to a winning position simultaneously in 6 states dead middle of the night at 3am after election date. another record as well.</p>
<p>while we're at it, covid is deadly and the mRNA vaccines are safe. we own nothing and we'll be happy. am i right?</p>

        <p>A moderate amount of those gases is of course necessary to keep our planet warm, but it makes total sense that the more of those gases there are, the hotter our planet becomes. The effects of this increase in climate can be very arguable (some previous estimates have already shown themselves to be wildly overexaggerated), but you don't have to be a genius to recognize that there has to be a limit to our temperature and that we can't just keep blasting CO² and other gases into our atmosphere as if it's not gonna change anything, because we know that certain temperatures will heavily affect us and our environment.</p>

<p>It really depends on where you live. Many people will be royally screwed, whether by rising temperatures, rising sea levels, or changes in weather patterns. Some will benefit, like those who live in Russia or Canada. Many more people--especially in Africa and south/southeast Asia-- will be punished severely.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that there is little topsoil in permafrost areas that will get warmer, and that there is trillions of dollars of investment in infrastructure in places that will become suboptimal. It's most likely a strong a net negative, though, yes, some will benefit from it.</p>

        <p>Why so? Science doesn't deny that volcanoes contribute to climate change, but just because you're not witnessing direct results of this influence in your everyday life, doesn't mean that this contributiom just isn't there. Compared to the amount of gases we let go into our atmosphere every year, the output of gases via volcanoes in the same timespan is nothing - even though volcanoes might look like they would cause a lot more trouble.</p>

        <p>I think most people who call it a hoax mean the second thing.  Speaking for myself...</p>
<p>Humans don't hurt the environment in terms of carbon output as much as people say.  Now pollution, waste disposal, and destroying the environment though poor logging and mining practices definitely are problems.</p>
<p>The hoax, much like covid, is the response to it.  We've been hearing the world is going to end since at least the 70s.  They keep changing the when and how.  First an ice age, then global warming, back to cooling, back to warming, to just climate change then to a climate crisis.  </p>
<p>They keep saying we need to raise taxes for some stupid reason to fix it.  They say countries like China and India, who put out the most pollution, should get a pass even though they pollute more now than we ever did.  In fact our money should go to them if they say they might stop polluting so much in 10 years.</p>
<p>They say we need to upend our economy and way of living for these "renewable" recourses that are far worse for the environment than a damn pipe line.  While completely ignoring nuclear as a viable, clean, nearly waste free option.  Those renewable resource companies get massive government subsidies and usually fail or go belly up while the government stooges make bank off them.</p>
<p>It's all a load of trash supported by very biased studies that purposefully leave out information and are funded by the people that want the "we're all gonna die" answer.</p>

        <p>The problem i see with this way of thinking is that you seem to portray science as some sort of singular entity. You're completely right on the point that some "scientific" studies have been completely out of bounds, presenting outcomes that have proven themselves to be incorrect - however it's definitely not fair to assume, that the scientific community as a whole actually ever agreed with those claims and its also quite wrong to act like "they told us, that..", when it was likely really just a handful of independent scientists. Especially if you mind that the media doesn't exactly shpw the most well-researched, but rather the most attention-grabbing studies, you just really shouldn't count on the thought that science as a whole actually agrees with those "scientific" claims made on tv. It's less of "science changing their mind about climate change constantly" and more of "bad research being revealed to be wrong as time goes on". The scientists who have actually done proper research probably haven't needed to adjust their estimates so often at all.</p>
<p>Nuclear energy though, hard agree. Still far from perfect with all the trouble around nuclear waste and poorly managed reactors in some parts of the world, but closer to success than other energy sources rn imo.</p>

        <p>Absolutely. Climate change quite probably is, to some extent, less influential than it is portrayed to be in the left media - that however of course doesn't mean that it is not influential in the slightest in reality, which is again a wrong assumption some people unfortunately seem to fall for. I still think that the good parts of science have proven that climate change very much an important thing to mind and already throws some things out of balance around the planet, but it's just 1) mostly portrayed in an odd way by focusing on uncertain estimates for the future rather than clear data shown by past events and 2) also worked on in the wrong ways by promoting inefficient technology, by abusing the "environment friendly" status to benefit the own businesses and by overall pushing the burden of fixing the problem onto the citizens of first world countries rather than global companies and countries like china, india.</p>

<p>OK. How? Don't just propose that we need to take action instead of those countries taking action. How about economic sanctions against them? Or we stop trade?</p>
<p>If you want to have the West hold accountable those countries, you should look into conservative positions that propose pulling that lever to force change.</p>
<p>Unless you have a better solution. Because trade from producer to consumer doesn't stop otherwise. Besides, you are affixing blame solely on the West still, which is an odd position to take since the West doesn't pollute like China or India. Again: they need to change before we do. They're creating the most pollution. Don't place responsibility on a secondary party.</p>
<p>&rt;overall just being less tolerant of companies that don't even really try to make their products CO2 neutral whatsoever. </p>
<p>Fuck your carbon neutral. It's a totalitarian lie. Again: talk to China and India before anyone does anything to appease such a ridiculous position.</p>

<p>Except we should be blamed. Fuck. Off. "Yet if we go by justice," then go to China and India. The West can't take on the sins of the world everyone partakes in, and everyone butches when we take control. </p>
<p>The West shouldn't change their entire way of life for some horseshit "carbon neutral" agenda when China and India are creating the vast bulk of all pollution. They have to fix one thing to fix 70% of the pollution, while you propose we change everything here to have a 10% impact. You are completely out of your mind.</p>

        <p>China is nothing more than one of the main countries that produces the supply to meet our demands. Most of products in China are produced for us in western countries and most western companies produce in countries like China. Of course China isn't fully innocent either because of their lack of attention paid to environment-friendly production within the country, but this is pretty much why companies produce there in first place. If they produce in China they don't have to put in the effort to make somewhat decent filtering systems for their gases emitted, they don't even have to pay decent wages or provide decent working conditions for the employees because China's laws don't require that much - of course China becomes some sorta main production hub for globalized companies then, it's no big surprise. You can't then go ahead and blame everything on the producer without caring about the one who demands this production, its like blaming the employee instead of the employer.</p>
<p>And even if China became the most environment friendly country in the world right now, this wouldn't fucking change anything, because all these western companies in China are gonna do is move to another country with shitty laws and do the same thing again. There's more than enough underdeveloped countries in the world to do that. So what I think is, that the way to truly solve this is to not focus on making it more difficult for them to produce the things they sell, but to make it more difficult for them to sell the things they produce. Even if western countries were to only collectively restrict the amount of plastic packaging allowed per product, that would already force the companies to either 1) finally make more environment-friendly packaging or 2) sell their goods in non-westerns countries, which they will not do because obviously western citizens are able to pay more.</p>

In the globalized world we live in companies can and will always pick the cheapest possible place for them to produce their products or gather there materials. A lot of the time, those places aren't in western countries, because western countries mostly have good labor rights, high minimum wages, require environmental care, etc - all of that costs a lot of money for the companies.</p>
<p>Of course it would be a lot better for our citizens and for our environment if they instead produced their products in western countries as well, but the focus of the companies is clearly not the well-being of the citizens or the environment, but rather getting as much profit as possible - which is more of the case in China than here. And it's not like our governments hate the companies for doing that either, those companies are the ones fueling our economies and since all the damage they do happens outside of western borders, the west world even gets to keep their "pro-human rights" and "environment-friendly" labels - you can just shift all the blame onto China because that's where it happens, even though we're the ones conditioning that to happen. You're actually doing the western world a big favor by believing in that innocent status theyd like to maintain.</p>
<p>It's a win-win for everyone involved in those deals, there's no interest to shut off trade and even if we did, we'd only move our production to the next cheapest country, one that probably doesn't have better laws to protect the environment (like i said already). This is by no means pro-China btw, i already said twice that China of course isn't innocent because they pretty much utilize their lack of environmental-protecting laws in order to attract companies, i just don't get how you think that we have absolutely nothing to do with this when we're the ones making the demands for all of those products to be made in first place. They're the "greedy" ones according to you because they sacrifice the well-being of their citizens for money, but we're not greedy even though we abuse their lack of laws ..for money, probably specifically going to countries where you're even free to throw your trash into rivers just so you don't need to pay the money to actually get rid of the garbage in a way that is good for the environment.</p>

        <p>So your proposal is still, "EvErYoNe In ThE wEsT mUsT cHaNgE!!!"</p>
<p>Why? Because China is a dumb child that can't do better?</p>
<p>Because the West are the "adults" in the room?</p>
<p>We would love to do more in the west. Go to a corporation and lay out your plan. Be careful the door doesn't hit you on the way out.</p>
<p>You're living in a la la utopia where all is just and right, and if it's not it's because the adults can't temper the children. That's basically what you're saying, you know.</p>
<p>Again: trade continues unabated and uncorrected unless you correct the source of the actual problem, not this virtual dance-around where blame is placed squarely on the West because of driving demand instead of where the demand is being produced. So either trade regulations and economic sanctions or nothing will be corrected.</p>

        <p>&rt;In what way do you think climate change is a hoax? Do you think that humans do not increase the amounts of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere, that humans do increase the amount of those gases but our influence isn't enough alter the earth's temperature in a meaningful way or, that greenhouse gases are unrelated to the earth's climate altogether?</p>
<p>The climate is constant flux; this isn’t a museum or server room requiring a permanent or optimum controlled state. The changing climate therefore is not problematic; this is more fear-mongering by the same folks for the same aims i.e what they will get people to accept under the premise. </p>
<p>If you think this is a real threat, the most effective step possible would be to sanction major polluting corporations to the point that they must clean up or not operate. They should be dealt with <strong>first</strong> as they contribute the most to pollution; way more than someone’s SUV. Are you also advocating that?</p>

        <p>I am absolutely advocating sanctioning corporations before restricting individuals or trying to push them to consume other products, which then again just makes more money for said corporations. Telling the citizens that their lifestyle is the problem even though all they do is use the products that are produced by the leading companies is just a way to shift the blame and the attention away from those that are providing the money. If everyone was instead demanding that the companies change their methods instead of everyone focusing on the public, that'd eventually force them to atleast do something for the environment to some extent, which then of course sucks for the companies.</p>
<p>...However i don't think that mankind-caused climate change is just a made up thing, specifically made for being able to sell "green" products for a higher cost than usual. Sure, if you look at just the suppossed results of our current climate change like melting glaciers or rising sea levels, you could obviously still get the thought that it could just be the occassional natural change in climate, but when looking at the data behind gas emissions, CO2 levels in the atmosphere, even just the time at which the climate started to change, it's hard to argue that mankind is just not contributing to our current change in climate. All the greenhouse gases we produce have to end up somewhere and the tons of gases that are already proven to be in our atmosphere couldn't all just have come from natural causes.</p>

        <p>Well I commend your stance on corporate contributors. Unfortunately most just parrot the hypocritical rhetoric of these companies painting themselves green while digging the belly out of our home.</p>
<p>I would say that (as usual) the data is mostly being misconstrued to lead others to conclusions and there’s nothing to freak out about. Yes man has habits I know should change for the good of all but if the corporate polluters can continue there would be little point. I don’t have links to hand but you should check out r/climateskeptics. It’s active but not overwhelming and lots of actually useful information.</p>

        <p>I don't think simple subreddits, just like almost every political community or forum around the internet, is a good source for "information" at all. Most of them are just hiveminds, collections of people who all share the same opinion and who all mostly become unwilling to even listen to outsiders. You'd think even they'd recognize plain misinformation eventually, but many of these communities are just filled with that from top to bottom and no one seems to care to do enough research to realize that. And even if someone does come there and point out flaws, they get labeled as "brainwashed outsider" and remain unconsidered. </p>
<p>If you think climateskeptics or even this subreddit is any different, i dare you to rightfully criticize posts there or even just look at my original comment at the top of this long reply chain. Downvoted 20-30 times so far, only for asking of what kind of "climate change hoax" another guy believes in, i guess only because its someone a member of this subreddit wouldnt be asking.</p>

        <p>...the damage caused to the enviornment during the pandemic (aggressive manufacturing/dissemination, mandating of single use plastic and trashy face masks) appears to be far more destructive then Covid. If our destructive environmental behavior has put our lives in such peril, then why would we compound that behavior when are lives are in substantially less peril? I thought we cared about others and their lives? </p>
<p>Then after I'd witnessed the incredible mass censorship of astonishingly well educated doctors and scientists offering fantastic and constructive solutions, I realized that this can't be new. </p>
<p>There must be tens and thousands of scientists who have more to offer the climate change discussion then the ones that I've been exposed to previously. </p>
<p>I consider our environment and our climate to be very serious subjects, though the handling of Covid has forced me to realize that I am very obviously lacking all of the facts.</p>

<p>KEY POINTS</p>
<p>Suicide attempts increased among adolescents aged 12 to 17, especially young girls, during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to CDC data.</p>
<p>Among the young girls, average weekly visits to the emergency department for suspected suicide attempts from February 2021 to March 2021 was 50.6% higher than the same period a year prior.</p>
<p>The study likely underrepresents the real number of suspected suicide attempts because Americans were hesitant to go to hospitals during the pandemic, in fear of contracting Covid-19.</p>

<p>Ethics and a rigid moral code is nothing but a weakness to be exploited by someone that shed any pretense at having one themselves. </p>
<p>if you act according to a moral law, you are predictable, and will lose.</p>

        <p>I don’t know one person who died of covid (one of my friends elderly parents did but he was 90 and also on his second round of pneumonia and the doctor even said covid was prob not the cause of death) 
HOWEVER I know one 11 year old girl who tried to kill herself and someone I used to work with actually did 
This whole thing is soo wrong and yes now the next agenda already pre packaged (climate change) is being pushed 
And how about the Davos group I’m sure they really want to help change the world into a better place not line their pockets 🤦‍♀️</p>

        <p>I know of a 12-year-old (a friend’s cousin) that jumped off of his apartment building and killed himself back in April.  My good high school friend also killed himself (or drank himself to death, we aren’t sure) a couple weeks ago at 24 years old.  </p>

        <p>So sad ! Sorry to hear we need this to end already ! And the experimental vaccine is not the answer 
Love how they run ads on tv without any disclaimer that we hear from every drug company when they advertise their drugs. 
How is that not mandatory ? 
What about the “side effects may include ...” or even “ talk to your doctor to see if the covid vaccine is right for you “
NOTHING 
Just GO GET IT or YOU’RE A GRANDMA KILLER 
Disgusting</p>

        <p>Who knew that money was all we needed to fix the environment?</p>
<p>I'm convinced almost all environmental charities and programs historically have been, and continue to be, one giant scam.</p>
<p>Think back to, oh, 1987. You are an activist with a non-profit. You start a charity that vaguely declares all donations will be going to "fight" the hole in the ozone. Now, you can never demonstrably prove that money went anywhere, was used for anything that can directly address the problem, or had any impact whatsoever. In fact, it I impossible to track that. Most likely the money gets laundress through some established phoney baloney not-for-profit, everyone takes a cut, and onto the next scam.</p>
<p>Think about that scenario now having happened thousands, tens of thousands, of times over the past 40 years. Oh and you can convince the gov't to give you a pipeline of money, too.</p>
<p>How many billions of dollars? Hundreds and hundreds? A trillion?</p>
<p>Why has none of this money worked yet? Where are all the improvements? WHERE DID ALL THAT MONEY AND TIME AND EFFORT GO?</p>
<p>Think about it. This leads to two conclusions: 1) there is no actual problem and this is a scam to separate people from their money for profit, or 2) there is a problem and nobody can fix it.</p>

        <p>Sadly it shows that the elites, and by extension government and media, don't care about the environment. Which logically you can conclude this isn't about depopulation either (because depop would be about saving the environment). This whole show was 100% to put a control grid on humanity. Which may lead to depop later, but who knows. </p>
<p>For now this nightmare needs to be resisted. I just see most people are broken now, psychologically traumatised. People who once were like "I'm never masking my kids" are now like "What's the big deal with them wearing masks all day at school?" and it's the vast majority of people broken. Makes me wanna throw up!</p>

        <p>I was working in infectious disease when all this happened and got let go because as a single parent they didn't know what to do with me.

        <p>For you, or anyone, who wonders why climate change was suddenly tossed to the curb... I recommend reading State of Fear by Michael Crichton. It's a techno thriller written in 2004, based on true climate stats. A rabbit hole you will thank me for later.</p>

        <p>I don't even think those in charge are doing so well. It's funny how this pandemic has backfired on everyone. Look at Fauci? This was suppose to be an easy way to make some money on his pharma shares. Now he's got a big target on his back and he's probably going to end up being the fall guy for when everything shakes out. Look at Bill Gates...he was riding high, now his wife's left him and it looks like he's in balls deep with this Epstein thing.</p>
<p>Economy's falling apart. Politicians are feeling the heat from their constituents and know full well they are just being played by big institutions. Academics and scientists are having to question their ethics and either tow the official line or question what they are seeing and be shamed and ridiculed. Meanwhile, joe and jane average are punching on in the street over whether they are wearing something on their face or not.</p>
<p>The irony is, everyone will lose long term.</p>

        <p>I think we don't know who 'really' is in charge. Fauci is just a puppet same with as all politicians pushing for this 'new normal'. Who really is pulling strings would be smart enough to stay in the shadows. And Gates is just a dumbass, I think his intelligence is greatly overrated.</p>

        <p>Funny you mention the economy. Remember last year when covidians complained that all we care about were "stonks"? You don't hear about that a lot anymore. Did they realize the economy is more than the stock market? Did it take the closure of thousands of small and big businesses alike and rampant inflation for them to realize that the effect on the economy was not trivial?</p>

        <p>Yep. And all these fuckers are using fb and instagram to be bossy and tell people to “mask up, save lives”, “get vaccinated or else you’re a selfish pos” - these assholes would <em>never</em> have the guts to say this stuff in person to people. Some of them go to the same gym as I do - and have this entire time. UNMASKED. Coming into contact with &rt;20 different people regularly. But then get on social media later and yell at people about the same thing?! Hypocrites.</p>

        <p>Do you mean having everyone having to heat and cool their larger homes during the day instead of shared spaces is bad for the environment?</p>
<p>And all of the packaging used by single deliveries of both food and items uses more gas than buying items in bulk is also bad?</p>
<p>And finally, the masks. Oceans of masks. Because COVIDians like to fuck the environment, selfishly pretending to be selfless, but in it out of their own fears.</p>

        <p>Since this started I've wondered why there hasn't been anything said or done about proper mask disposal. Haven't seen any masks discarded along the road. No biohazard-like collection bins anywhere. There's been more concern about used heroin needles that are discarded on roads/streets/parks and <em>might</em> carry something contagious. It's almost like the virus doesn't spread as easily as they want us to believe.</p>

        <p>It's astounding how badly effected a LOT of people have been by this, made all the more crippling by their acquiescence. One of the biggest things that has prevented me from cracking up has been the absolute conviction in the falsehood of this scamdemic. I have refused to be swayed, by anything.

        <p>The thing is that they want us to be on different sides of the spectrum. They want us this way so they go forward with their next move. We are also being used in the grand scheme of things. We will be the scapegoat for strict laws and lockdowns in the near future. Also wanted to mention to have anger towards them (politicians, scientists, msm, police officers/law enforcement) will only make your health worse. They are just simple minions who take orders  and are completely unaware of what is happening. They may consider themselves as heroes but they are just playing their part in this show. Don't get angry, frustrated or vengeful it's not good for your health. It took me a long time to learn this but it really helped my well being. Avoid the lower based emotions. Hopefully you all understand what I'm trying to get at. I really enjoy this thread and I'm very happy to come across all the people who have posted here. It gives me hope and courage. THANK YOU ALL. LOTS OF LOVE.</p>

        <p>It's not about a "piece of cloth".  It's about being forced to sacrifice social interactions, being isolated from family, having your livelihood or possibly your small business taken away from you, being cooped up in the house for extended periods of time, having your education and your school experience neutered if you are a student, having various forms of stress relief (ie going to the bar, seeing live shows, going on destination vacations) restricted.  People have lost all their money due to lockdowns.  People have lost their homes.  People have taken their own lives due to lockdowns.  "Piece of cloth" my ass.   Oh and PS, if you think wearing a mask is no big deal, tell it to rape victims who suffer PTSD flashbacks when their mouths are covered.  Tell it to autistic and other developmentally disabled individuals who have a full-on mental breakdown when they have to put on a mask.</p>
<p>Also, imagine thinking that wearing a "piece of cloth" does anything whatsoever other than make you look like a faceless moron drone.  Yeah, the key to stopping infectious disease is strapping a cut-up t-shirt to your face, but somehow we weren't able to figure it out for 200,000 years and only just discovered it in 2020.  Get the fuck outta here.</p>

        <p>(Going by the thought that this pandemic is real and natural) if they kept everything open and just ignored the virus due to a survival rate that is high for most age groups, it's not like everything would suddenly be fine now, it'd just be different people getting different consequences. Of course the rise of mental health problems during the pandemic is nothing to downplay and the extent of the regulations done can still very much be discussed, but if the alternative is just leading older people or people with pre-existing conditions to death, its just not very fair to talk as if society is terrible for shutting things down at all. 
I still wish you all the best of course, the optimal situation would definitely be if no one had to suffer from the pandemic, but i just do not think that this is possible to this age.</p>

        <p>Thing is though I'm not advocating that NOTHING be done. But they never even considered or tried to implement a system that benefits and protects the elderly and vulnerable whilst letting the rest of us get on with our lives as normal. I'm sure it would be a more financially viable option, too; all the money spunked on lockdowns, furlough and Covid propaganda could have been put to better use.</p>
<p>They've had well over a year to create a better system but they've gone "nah, lockdowns are good enough". Fucking lazy and evil as far as I'm concerned.</p>

        <p>Right now that option, atleast in some countries, is pretty much the vaccines.. Since you're not on the extreme anti-covid regulation side that i wrongfully assumed you're on (sorry for that btw) i pretty much agree though, the whole advertisement money could and should've been put to better use. The problem is just, while the governments do get a clear economic benefit from a vaccinated society, they wouldn't exactly gain any cash from caring about the mental health problems from their citizens, so they use that money to invest in something that will give them money back instead, which in this case is advertisement for the vaccine. So yes, while it would be great to find some balance where all groups are atleast somewhat satisfied, that is unlikely to happen unless it somehow benefits them economically too. Similar things can be said about the effects on the environment too: they don't gove a shit about it because protecting it doesn't give them money - for us to ever even get clean energy, clean energy would have to be the superior choice on an economic level as well.</p>
