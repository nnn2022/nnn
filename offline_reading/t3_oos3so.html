    <strong>A positive message ‚ù£</strong>
    <p><p>Hi! I just wanted to share some light here...</p>
<p>In March 2020 the UK was put under ~~house arrest~~ lockdown. I always knew there was more to it than meets the eye and it has been so so incredibly lonely not having friends who share, or even understand my POV.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I have been able to attend two Freedom Marches in the UK, and I just want to thank everybody for making an effort to show up to these things. We're not alone, we're not going insane and we can stand in solidarity in the frustration and isolation.</p>
<p>One of my favourite things about this movement is the different types of people it brings together. </p>
<p>Right-Wingers, Hippies, Evangelicals, Catholics, New-Agers, Young, Old, Ravers, Lads, Liberals, Families, Nurses, Black, White, Nuns.. I've seen all sorts of people at these events and it makes my heart swell that we stand together. üíñ</p>
<p>So, thanks to to Mods for having this space and thanks to everybody for taking part in it. It would be awesome to have some friends, (even just online friends) who are part of this movement , so feel free to message me :)</p></p>
