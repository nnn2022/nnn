    <strong>Lockdowns? Record unemployment? Let's bring in 400,000 more people next year! That will fix everything!!!</strong>
    <p><p>&rt;"Canada on Friday increased its <a href="https://globalnews.ca/tag/immigration/">immigration</a> targets to bolster the economy and fill jobs in sectors experiencing shortages after the <a href="https://globalnews.ca/tag/COVID-19">COVID-19</a> pandemic led to closed borders and a sharp slowdown in new arrivals", the immigration minister said.</p>
<p>WHAT???</p>
<p>- Maybe the job sectors with "shortages" should be filled by those <em>already here</em> and who are now jobless because of the Scam-Demic!</p>
<p>- "Sharp slowdown in new arrivals"? Sure - <em>after</em> the WuFlu dug in its heels here!  Didn't want to close the borders until we could do our our "global duty" with everyone else and have our lives upturned by the virus, eh Justin?</p>
<p>- Why do Canadian politicians see immigration numbers as some sort of contest that we have to "win"? </p>
<p><em>Simple - because sowing division, lowering wages and standard of living, reducing opportunities, and destruction of cultures is an integral part of Agenda 2030 and the "Great Reset"!</em></p>

        <p>I hear so much about how Trump improved the economy, and how his goal is to continue to improve the economy and there will be more jobs, yet I hear NOTHING from Trudeau or anyone running against him about how they’re going to improve our Canadian economy or increase jobs. </p>
<p>Instead we hear BULLSHIT like this, our cost of living keeps going up yet wages stay the same, and literally NOTHING improves with our economy. </p>
<p>They won’t even let tourists in to boost our economy in that respect,  but they’ll let immigrants come in and suck off our economy while we suffer for it. Great.</p>

        <p>Our politicians are all cut from the same cloth - they all worship at the altars of mass third-world immigration, "diversity", and Agenda 2030. The "Rona is a godsend to them - it enables them to step up the pace of the program to turn Canada into nothing more than a 24/7 full service global hotel - with old stock Canadians as the bellhops.</p>
<p>Immigrants want our benefits and will throw their vote to whomever gives them the most baksheesh. Since they tend to move to the same places (Toronto/Vancouver/Montreal) the key urban ridings they reside in now basically control the Canadian political landscape.</p>
<p>Hence why Trudeau, especially, wants more of them.</p>

        <p>The corporations are indiscriminate, they don't care who works for them as long as the labor is cheap and they don't complain about working conditions. Soon enough we will see the new class system. There will be those in control, those who sustain the control and those who are under control and a large percentage of the world's population will be eradicated so this system can be maintained.  What we are seeing today is part of their aptitude test. They are separating the dissidents from the compliant , then they will dissect this compliant herd into those who will make good enforcers and those who will make good slaves. </p>
<p>It's ironic, but the people who probably stand the best chance are those who are among the outspoken aggressive mask wearing community. They have proven compliance and they are willing to exert force to uphold that compliance..</p>
<p>Well that's that, it's time to put on my sheep costume and mask and start mobbing people who are threatening the safety of us all but not complying. lol..</p>

        <p>It might be more complex than that, often immigrants do jobs that no born and bred nationals want to do.  Jobs like caring for elderly, cleaning, janitorial work, fruitpicking / harvesting, hard manual labouring, even some skilled manual work like bricklaying, roofing, plumbing, etc. tend to suffer from shortages of nationals wanting to do them.  </p>
<p>Whether it's because they think they are 'above' that kind of work, or are just told to pursue white collar / academic based work at school, very few nationals want these jobs, they would rather exist on government schemes than do them, even our new swathe of jobless people, most of them would rather live a shitty existence on a government scheme than do hard labour everyday or clean office toilets.  Anyway, would you really tell the guy who owned a restaurant and just lost everything 'OK champ, suck it up, we have a great job for you earning minimum wage picking strawberries for 9 hours a day!' </p>
<p>Assuming these immigrants will take jobs away from nationals is wrong, and there isn't any evidence to suggest job displacement from immigrants actually happens on a national level, although there is some to suggest it can happen in localised immigrant hotspots.</p>
<p>In conclusion - 'DEY TURRKK ARRR JEERRBBSS'</p>

        <p>The jobs you referring to pay less than subsistence wages <em>by design</em>, for two reasons:</p>
<p>- Since the existing population can't feed themselves can't put a roof over their heads or feed themselves (let alone a family) doing them, they don't do them. This creates the excuse needed to bring in "temporary" foreign workers, who will accept the lower wages and living in work camps or 6 to an apartment.</p>
<p>- It removes "entry level" jobs for natives, which formerly were filled by students and those who lacked education but used them as a foot in the door to make the connections to either get promoted within an organization, or find better employment at another.</p>
<p>It's a race to the bottom, and you seem to approve of it.</p>
<p>In addition, real wages haven't risen since about 1970 - but costs have skyrocketed. A house used to be 3x the average annual wage - now it is 10x or more in some locales. A car loan used to be 2 or 3 years, now they can go to 84 months. Why? Strangely enough, this is the same time period that mass immigration policies began to become the norm in Europe and North America. Coincidence? I don't think so.</p>
<p>Lastly, you fail to take into account outsourcing, AKA "immigration effects without bringing in immigrants". The "good" jobs have fled the country since the 80's - replaced with... minimum wage service jobs. So who exactly has benefited from any of this? </p>
<p>It's typical globalist tripe - bring in policies that cause economic and social damage to everyone but themselves, and blame the victims of it for "expecting too much" or spouting rubbish like "they should have learned to code".</p>
<p>It's vile.</p>

        <p>Well, you're wrong on a lot of these points. You can survive doing them and without living in a camp, depending on where you are.  Many immigrants do and still have enough money left over to send back to their families in their home countries.  The skilled manual labour jobs I mentioned actually pay really well in most places. You can easily earn as much being a plumber as you can being a doctor, probably more and yet natives don't want to do it.  Globalisation certainly has caused a lot of issues, but even if you paid double what some of these low level jobs pay, I still think most natives would turn their noses up at doing them.  I'm not sure that students who want a job cleaning or fruit picking would have any trouble getting one, although 'barista' seems to be the furthest most of them will 'lower' themselves to be honest.  Most would rather just take out enormous loans and not work at all.  Most universities have schemes as part of the course that allow you to get work placements and make industry contacts that way.</p>
<p>As to house prices, this is all really dependent on where you are. It's really foreign investment into big cities that has caused runaway property prices. Out on the countryside, houses are much more affordable but of course, there aren't really decent jobs out there.  I'd definitely be behind more regulation of foreign investment into property though.</p>
<p>It's also pretty funny that you can accuse globalisation of meaning westerners pay too much for stuff, when we all buy dirt cheap clothes and electronics made by people who are effectively slaves paid less than a dollar a day in the 3rd world. It's really not some simple issue that can be solved or properly discussed in a reddit comment.  I definitely agree, there are disgusting things perpetuated by globalism but lazy native westerners given every chance to succeed who still don't and then blame immigrants for it are not near the top of my concerns compared to kids in Bangladesh sewing footballs together for a few cents.  Or probably masks these days I guess.  If by 'good' jobs, you mean that kind of thing or assembling electronics, well, we could all end that ourselves by refusing to buy those products that are manufactured unethically. Remember though, everyone would also have to be willing to pay far higher prices than we do now for all those things if those jobs were located in a western country. </p>
<p>What I hate though is too often, and I don't mean you in particular, but certainly some comments in this thread, this kind of criticism of immigration is really just thinly veiled racism. In the UK, we had the Brexit vote, the majority of EU immigration we have is from Eastern Europe ie. White people.  Who did the Brexit campaign put on their anti-immigration posters? Brown skinned Turkish people, a country which isn't even in the EU.</p>
