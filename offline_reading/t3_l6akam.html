        <p>I guess it’s your choice to believe fearmongering over sensationalism. I, personally, follow the path of the most evidence, which lies with media exaggerating. </p>
<p>Did the government tell them to do that? Maybe. Cus the NHS is fucked rn. That’s all the governments fault, as are a lot of things. Not sure about the somewhat extremist view, with little to no evidence linking any purpose to the effects of the lockdown, that the government is trying to monopolise the economy. </p>
<p>I’m always open to more evidence though.</p>

        <p>It’s impossible to say that the actual numbers are still high. How exactly can you tell without going through every death certificate to check. They could just as easy be really low. It’s possible the real figure could be 10% of 100,000 as the PCR test gives 90% false positives in the first place. A good place to begin would be to check this years death toll for individual causes and check them against previous years death toll to see where the excess mortality, if any, is happening. Even then you still have to take away all the extra suicides, heart attacks, and other mortality caused by COVID restrictions before you get anywhere near the true figure of people actually killed by COVID.</p>

<li>
<p>The numbers are available on the gov website to see how many people actually died of covid related issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the context of deaths, the PCR effectiveness is a moot statement, despite the fact that 90% false positives is incorrect, it’s between 0.8-4.3%. So by the point of death, sometimes 3 tests will have been carried out, leaving margin for error low. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’ve already done multiple data checks, week 40 2020, 750 covid deaths, 9.5k overall. Week 40 2019, 9.5k overall deaths, obviously non contributed as covid at this point.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Considering our death rate goes down every year at a considerable rate, also considering the exact same time period for temperature and sickness variables, that’s about 1000 more deaths than we should’ve had.</p>

        <p>I appreciate the new source, but it only says, in simple terms, be careful of issuing results on one test alone if the positive is weak. I’ll accept fault if you find evidence of the NHS being trigger happy on the viral load. </p>
<p>Also, it literally says PCR should be used in accordance with other factors, so no it doesn’t diagnose alone, it aids in diagnosis, done by medical professionals. </p>
<p>If the there’s evidence of testers not applying the test in a professional manner, I’d also like to see that, otherwise, it’s all assumption to me.</p>

        <p>So why are people being diagnosed as having COVID when they have no symptoms whatsoever because of a positive PCR test? It didn’t say before that it was an aid in diagnosis. It was used to diagnose full stop. If we’d had an accurate test from the beginning I doubt a single lockdown would’ve been implemented anywhere. Why did they have to tell people carrying out the tests to be careful if they already were? Why get other evidence of infection to back up a diagnosis if it was already being done? It’s clear that if the test was being utilised in the correct manner no update would have been required.</p>

        <p>But if they are saying "for any reason within 28 days of positive test", why would someone think they are trying to inflate? This just tells me that that number died within 28 days of positive teste. Please tell me how they are trying to wrong me, I really can't understand. If someone wants real numbers, then he can find it in academic studies, not on the news.</p>

        <p>Because that kind of statistic is completely useless. Imagine:</p>
<p>&rt;person tests positive for COVID</p>
<p>&rt;one week later, symptoms disappear</p>
<p>&rt;another week later, dies from a plane crash</p>
<p>&rt;his death is added to the tally</p>

        <p>And what about:
Gets covid
Checks in to the hospital
Recovers (does it really?)
Goes home
Dies in the same week because covid destroyed his lungs
Is covid negative
Is it not death by covid?
Well to be fair, a person dies because his body can no longer be kept alive. Covid doesn't kill. Like a gun. You don't die because a bullet entered your brain, you died because your brain can no longer function. You got me! \s
And no, they don't count if you died in a plane crash even with covid.</p>

        <p>In your example the death would be added to the tally of coronavirus deaths because their death would be within 28 days. </p>
<p>Why do you not have a problem with <em>any</em> death after a <em>positive  test</em> because called a death from covid? The means that all unrelated deaths are being added. All false positive deaths. 50k people die normally per month. (0.1%). As we are testing 1% of the population <em>per day</em>, a whole bunch of those people would be expected to die regardless. </p>

        <p>It’s the media’s job to find real figures and present them to the public, or at least it used to be. Find out the truth, tell the public and let them decide for themselves what’s really going on. Not say something misleading and then say to themselves “Well, they can always go and find out the truth for themselves if they really want to”. Most people trust (and identify themselves with) their news channel or paper of choice and never look anywhere else or question what they’ve been told. You would think just one of the big players would give an alternative view of the world narrative but they don’t seem to. There are some very isolated articles here and there but they’re swamped by an avalanche of misleading information. Even that headline above is misleading. Why doesn’t it say in much bigger letters that the deaths are for any reason within 28 days of a 7% accurate PCR test? No let’s make the number big and red and put the caveat in tiny writing underneath. It’s basic psychology. It’s misleading and manipulative on purpose. It’s not a mistake.</p>

        <p>News media has lost all credibility to me. They can't wrong me because I'm actively trying to learn only the truth. What I can't prove that is true, I just take it with a grain of salt. It's all onion to me. The problem is the population is happy to bow before the government and happy to believe the lies of the side they are part of. As for me, I'm a despicable neutral.

        <p>No actually they label multiple things on a death certificate so if you have COVID and also cancer those both will be written on the death certificate this is a very common situation in the medical field but if you did test positive for COVID and die they will put it on the death toll even if the primary reason is another disease Covid probably made you die quicker thus it does go in the death count they don’t just inflate the numbers maybe the numbers are even higher if we don’t test enough the government isn’t trying to scare you to stay inside it is trying to prevent you someone who doesn’t know what the fuck is talking about from getting a virus that you think is fake and then you’ll go to your grandma and wonder why she has a cough some days later after you visited her . No it can’t be ! Now because of your negligence your grandma and other people who are at higher risk of dying than you because they are immunocompromised or old have Covid and are lying in their hospital bed on the brink of death I wish you a happy life knowing that if you get COVID because of your negligence, people die</p>

        <p>Anyone with COVID on the death certificate is counted as a “covid death” in the stats that you see on the news. It does inflate the numbers whether you like it or not because those numbers are presented as if all those people died as a result of COVID when they did not. </p>
<p>Imagine if you had a cold and someone came up and shot you dead. We wouldn’t count that as a cold death, the fact that you had a cold at the time was utterly unrelated to what killed you. Why should it be any different for COVID? Moreover, why do you act like it’s totally normal to do death stats this way?</p>

        <p>Just for shits and giggles, let’s take out all the party propaganda and MSM BS blurbs from this paragraph and see what we have left. The PCR test is garbage. It’s own inventor said it was never to be used as a diagnostic instrument. So automatically the numbers are BS. The one single thing you’re right about is the govt. isn’t trying to scare you to stay inside. The govt. is keeping you under illegal house arrest so they can continue to totally destroy small business and drag the entire economy down with it. From the phrasing of your paragraph I’m going to make some inferences and not bother to dismantle the rest of your “argument”. You’re out of your depth little sheep, get along now.</p>

        <p>Yep. All done with a garbage PCR test that reacts to motor oil, mango fruits, human skin and cell tissue, and tons of other things that <em>shouldn't give in a positive result</em>. The president of Tanzania (!) explained that in a video, it was pretty funny.</p>
<p>So if you test one million people a day and have a 1-2% error rate, you'll automatically get 10.000-20.000 cases a day. That's really great, innit?</p>

        <p>Given how disturbingly compliant the UK population has been, it's refreshing and surprising that the official statistics have always been relatively open about how the deaths are recorded.</p>
<p>If you try to find similar criteria for other countries it is behind walls of obfuscation if it is there at all.</p>

        <p>People were also labelled conspiracy theorists when talking about how sensitive the PCR test was with counting cycles , now the WHO has told all the countries to lower the thresholds which basically rectifies how all the previous positives don't mean shit. Yh "conspiracy theory".</p>

        <p>&rt;Given how disturbingly compliant the UK population has been, it's refreshing and surprising that the official statistics have always been relatively open about how the deaths are recorded.</p>
<p>lol what? people have been ignoring it since the start, having parties in the middle of lockdowns, etc. thats why we're doing so terribly compared to most of the world - idiots that think they're too important for the rules to apply to.</p>
<p>76000 excess deaths (a 20% increase in overall death count) not good enough for you?</p>

        <p>The UK has a disproportionately older population, high population density and low temperature high humidity weather. It is the perfect place for a flu virus to thrive.</p>
<p>If you want to rely on that excess death statistic you're going to need a proper apportionment to, say, suicide, domestic violence, postponed medical treatment etc.</p>

        <p>I am no expert, but this had me do some research, I found the stats page: </p>
<p>https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/deaths?areaType=nation&amp;areaName=England</p>
<p>It has the section "Daily deaths with COVID-19 on the death certificate by date of death" right below "Deaths within 28 days of positive test by date reported"</p>
<p>That section comes to a count of 92,257 deaths.</p>
<p>The WHO defines it as: "A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma)."</p>
<p>I don't think the slide shared here would include "people who had a positive test and then had a car accident".</p>

        <p>The grandmother of a friend of mine went to the hospital with covid. She managed to to survive and went home. She didn't last a week. When she died, she was covid negative. But in reality, it was covid who killed her. People tend to cherry pick the examples they want, unfortunelly for them, and for me, I have a few examples of the opposite.</p>

        <p>I have come to the conclusion that people are just way to afraid of the true horror that is really being perpetuated upon humanity that they just "mask" that fear with the fear of the virus. It is a much more comfortable thought that the governments are all just good guys trying to keep everybody safe.</p>

        <p>Well thats because, get this, covid can still lead to your death even if its indirectly because, say you have cancer, well if the cancer kills you after getting covid covid still likely had a huge part due to weakening your body.  They count that because theres a good chance covid is what amplified what killed you</p>

        <p>In my state, NM, the DOH explains that 15% of Covid deaths are based on clinical observation. So when medical providers observe fever, pneumonia, flu, shortness of breath = Covid-19 death. Without testing! Imo the number of death is around 50 % "true" Covid-19 death. The others died with, not of Covid-19, or based on clinical obs.</p>

        <p>Ideally, we would test everybody who goes through a hospital. However, many hospitals don't have enough tests to test all of their patients. They'll likely only administer a test if you show symptoms. Somebody entering the hospital because of a stroke may very well go untested. There's a reason entire hospital wings are designated for covid, and non-covid patients don't go near there.</p>

        <p>You know that they brought this in to reduce the death rate, right? When they brought in the 28-day rule it took thousands of Covid-related deaths off of the death count. The number of deaths if you take death certificates that mention Covid-19 is higher than the government's official death count.</p>

<p>I asked because the sources I've seen contradict what you've said. There hasn't been a noticeable increase in suicides.</p>

        <p>Your own source gives other reasons like less people seeking treatment for other diseases like heart attacks and such so thanks for that. Considering heart disease is the second leading cause of death I can see how people who are scared to go to the hospital are dying at home instead of getting treatment.</p>

        <p>Interesting...</p>
<p>So the UK reported 2020 mortality rates at 1038 and 1079 per 100,000 respectively for England and Wales, which they are classifying as a "significant" increase from prior years</p>
<p>However and although there was a slight 10 year dip prior to this where mortality rates fell under these numbers, the lowest being 2019 when mortality rates were 908 and 984 per 100,000, a net difference of 130, and 95 respectively. Now this may seem quite significant as it reflects a 14% and 9.5% increase which can be perceived as unusually high, of course that is only relative to the prior year.  </p>
<p>Should we compare these numbers to even as recent as 2018, the differential is  not nearly as substantial at 6.5% and 1% respectively...You see 2019 was carried an unusually low mortality rate. </p>
<p>Let's go back a little further to 2001...The mortality rates were 1230 and 1295 respectively...Well compared to 2020, that's a 17% and 20 % increase over a year with a "lethal" pandemic...lol...and relative to 2019 which is the "baseline", it becomes a 35% and 31% increase....OMG!..people should have been running for their lives, hiding in caves.. Why weren't there lockdowns and mask mandates, social distancing, among other measures from 2000 -2008 lol..</p>
<p>You see, it's cyclic and we are on the up cycle, it's simply the way nature works...People begin to age, get sick and suffer from terminal illnesses creating cycles of high death rates followed by lowered death rates..</p>
