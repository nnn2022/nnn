    <strong>Lads and lasses, I'm so tired</strong>
    <p><p>I just have to get this out. No one I know understands... Life where I am was isolated enough. The people where I live are shitheads and they hated me for being a lone wolf before the pandemic, so I'm completely alone. All I've got in person is my dad. I am a homebody but I've been so depressed... </p>
<p>As soon as we saw cases appear in China, I called this shit. I just <em>knew</em> that if it appeared here, it would kill a lot of people at first then slowly mutate and become less dangerous as all viruses do, but the government would never roll back the control measures. And that's exactly what happened. It's just always becoming worse, every day. Before all this, I was trying to get my boyfriend here from America so he could live with me, but after nearly a year with no progress and no sign of things changing any time soon, I'm almost tempted to write it off. All I do is sit on my computer all day talking to him or sleeping, because the weather where I live is so extreme most of the time I can't go outside. My boyfriend is sympathetic to me, but he's still scared. His mother has some health issues so I get it. Mine does too but she's abusive and my parents just divorced, so I couldn't care less. But he doesn't seem to understand that this isn't even about a virus anymore. I couldn't get any mental health help even before, so now there's nothing except my twice yearly psychiatrist appointments. I'm seeing him next week, and I can't tell him any of this. He's a good honest man, but he will say what he's been told to say for fear of losing his job.</p>
<p>I want to go out and have a cup of coffee, I want to see my friend (yeah, I only have one in this country.) But any time I do go out for provisions I'm reminded everywhere all the time how nothing will ever be the same again. I wondered to myself while in the village today, is this how people in Soviet Russia felt as the totalitarianism slowly increased? Scared and desperate for freedom, knowing it will only get worse, but rendered completely powerless and disenfranchised. Completely at the mercy of the State. I'm so miserable, and I know some of you must feel the same. I just need to know I'm not alone.</p></p>

        <p>It's tough. Worst part is, the crucial information is being held back by media outlets. I read about a court in Portugal ruling that PCR tests (with more than 25 cycles) cannot determine anyone's infection. I read about the Danish protests, stopping a mandatory vaxination law. We see the democratic powers working, albeit in small parts. But that shit never makes it to the mainstream news. The general public is given nothing that might even remotely make them doubt the validity of all this bullshit. </p>
<p>It's discouraging to see the sheer power of whoever the fuck is behind all this. The way the media manipulation just... works. I never would have thought this was possible. It's frighteningly genius.</p>

        <p>I feel you!<br>
I'm so isolated as well on various levels. Nobody understands how I'm seeing this all unfold. They think I am taking it all too personally and overreacting. </p>
<p>They tell me this will all be over soon, and I just have to wait - but for how long??</p>
<p>We've lost rights, freedoms, and a lot of us are loosing the will to live. </p>
<p>Even though I know I'm not alone in my thoughts, I am still alone in not having someone who understands me here.</p>
<p>I avoid leaving my house, not because I fear getting sick - but because I fear seeing everyone else wearing their masks and assuming I'm a diseased killer.</p>

        <p>Dude, you don't know how much this hits home. I'm in the <em>exact</em> same boat as you. I'm just sick of this pathetic life we're all living now and anytime I bring up the loss of our freedoms and liberties the brainwashed sheep at my work just roll their eyes and think I'm a conspiracy theorist.</p>
<p>I don't even know what to do any more. Coming here is the only thing that keeps the little sanity I have left.</p>

        <p>I just work online, and then sleep only to work online again and then sleep...</p>
<p>It's  impossible for everyone to be expected to take all this, and yet we are ALL supposed to follow along and "make it through".</p>
<p>What are we living for right now?? <br>
A vaccine?  <br>
Flu season to be over? <br>
Or something else?  </p>
<p>I don't know what to do anymore either. <br>
Literally every single day that this presses on - I die a little,</p>

        <p>Already vented on someone elses post here. A lot of us feel the hopelessness.<br>
One thing I think can help is live like you want to or like you would without the "pandemic" as best you could. I think the only thing keeping me from falling into depression right now is having set goals for my training and personal life. <br>
Keeping away as much as possible from the computer and forcing myself to get out into the sun or work more on my own after-work projects helps a lot too.</p>
<p>That said I am in the same situation, noone I can really talk to about this in my real life and it sucks big.</p>

        <p>There are many people who know exactly what is happening, like yourself. The sad part is that the majority are willfully ignorant. I'm just wondering how long all of this can go on. Because you CAN'T lock people up without a job or income for ever. People NEED to eat. Eventually they will be FORCED to say "f*ck it!" and start violently protesting. History is littered with stories like this. Even the most ardent doomer will be forced to see that being curled up in a fetal masked ball in the corner of their room is not a viable long term thing. Sadly, though it will have to get a lot worse before some of the idiot sheep decide to wake up and take their lives back. It is a nice fantasy to think that the politicians, medics, scientists and media persons will encounter the same fate as the nobility in the French revolution. Through all of this, "science" has thoroughly discredited itself and shown that it is just as corrupt as any criminal (or politician). There will come a time when the word "science" will be synonymous with the word "bullsh*t." Trump was SO right to pull funding from the corrupt W.H.O. that started all of this hysteria.</p>
