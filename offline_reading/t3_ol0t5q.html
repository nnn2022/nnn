        <p>I am going to be posting articles that support our decisions to not participate in the "vaccine bullshit" that's sweeping the world.  LOTS of new science stating that if you have had Covid, you do not need the vaccine.  Too bad our world cannot handle this option but science is still science.</p>

        <p>They've been saying the whole time you can't be immune unless you have vaccination. Which anybody with two brain cells knows is bullshit. </p>
<p>Main issue is proving that you've had it. They should be doing anti body tests and allowing you to be exempt on that basis.</p>

        <p>Absolutely!  Problem is that NOBODY even understands that is a possibility.  Our local doctors can't even understand that concept anymore.</p>

        <p>Well these things are how we know something is not right. At the very least. </p>
<p>I just saw on national news a giddy report about how great it was that France have received a million vaccine bookings now that he's basically made it mandatory to do anything. "what a great way to get the numbers up" he said with a big smile. </p>
<p>Then I saw an article about how they're advising not to exercise for a week after getting some vaccines as you may have a heart attack. </p>
<p>You can't make this shit up, it's like early 90s action movies portrayal of dystopian future.</p>

        <p>I was at our county board of health meeting, in a room full of doctors, and here's how one conversation went.  </p>
<p>Doc1 "So Doc2, have you seen any delta variant in your hospital?</p>
<p>Doc2 "Yes we are starting to see that."<br>
Doc1 "How many cases are you seeing?"<br>
Doc2 "I'm not sure, I didn't count them."<br>
Doc1 "How many of the affected are unvaccinated?"<br>
Doc2 "Somebody mentioned that most of them were unvaccinated."  </p>
<p>These are the doctors that decide the policies for our county.</p>

        <p>Sadly this was the intellectual high point of the meeting.  They have zero actual knowledge of medicine outside of what they are spoonfed from the FDA and medical groups.</p>

        <p>Its hard to find doctors that actually think for them self lately. They just follow the concensus. I guess I medical school all they do is to memorize stuff. There is no research involved in medical school. Basically advance mechanic school. This piece goes here, this piece goes there. Check the oil, refill on gas and your good to go</p>

        <p>It's not like they don't know that previous infection provides immunity, they just don't want to remind you. I was thinking about this the other day bc early on there were tons of articles written when one or two people got reinfected. It was like the end if the world. Then those stories stopped. Anyone with 2 working brain cells knows if reinfection was occurring it would be all over the news as part of their push for vaccination.</p>

        <p>Even the CDC says that's an extremely rare from their website here:</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html</p>
<p>"Even if you have already recovered from COVID-19, it is possible—although rare—that you could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 again"  </p>
<p>So....I need it, but they can't say why I need it because the chances of getting Covid again are rare.  </p>
