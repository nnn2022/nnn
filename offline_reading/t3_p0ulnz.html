<title>Blood transfusions - safe? Just wondering what everyone thinks about the possibility that the blood supply could be tainted by vaccinated blood. I have not read anything yet but if that spike protein is in blood products we could be in trouble.</title>

    <p><p>Considering that there is no “test” for C19 as no testable isolated “virus” exists, how can we know?  After seeing images of clotted blood after vaccination what’s to say it can’t be passed via transfusion? </p>
<p>Just brainstorming to know if anyone else is thinking about this or if there are any articles about it because I haven’t seen any.</p></p>

        <p>I'd rather not have a blood transfusion from someone recently vaccinated. However if you're in the situation of needing a blood transfusion, you normally can't be picky.</p>

        <p>True, but there are some situations, like having surgery, where you can bank your own blood ahead of time in case you need a transfusion</p>

        <p>Idk where you live but in most places with decent healthcare, in general, I’d say you can. They have to be carful with blood transfusions, if it’s not a match someone could die and giving someone’s blood back to them is the safest type of transfusion. There are medical mistakes sometimes, but if you’re going in for any type of care you’re taking the risk of that happening.</p>

        <p>I’ve been told by my local blood bank I can not donate blood anymore because I got the vaccine.
Have been regularly donating blood for many years and now it’s all over.
They definitely know that the vaccine taints blood if they are no longer allowing me to donate</p>

        <p>You really have no idea.
I went in to do my routine blood donation as per normal.
After filling in my form as per every appointment they asked me about my vaccine history.
I ticked the box for recently vaccinated.</p>
<p>They then directed me and spoke with me verbally.</p>
<p>They then asked to take a sample of my blood.
After they got the results back they called me a few days later and said at this point in Time they can’t unfortunately take my blood as it was not safe to transfuse my blood into another person.</p>
<p>If you’re vaccinated I’d definitely recommend going and trying yourself before disregarding other people’s comments with crude reply.</p>
<p>You actually sound like a full knob by the way you reply.
Next time in your approach how about coming forward with a reply no so hostile.
You make an ass out of yourself.</p>
<p>Again happy for you to get vaccinated and let me know how you go. Bro!
Fuck up idiot speaking with yourself childish language honestly.</p>

        <p>And that response completely validates everything I said, thank you! They should have taught you better English before putting you on the misinformation campaign. They're getting so desperate they'll grab anyone that seems to have a grasp on it.</p>

        <p>Strange they would stop testing in June, unless they discovered the testing method was flawed…</p>
<p>Why stop testing for the antibodies? They were giving people blood from C19 survivors so they could recover faster.  Asking for volunteers on the radio with constant ads.  But as I think about it, I have not heard ANY ads on the radio for a while asking for plasma donations.  Was a woman’s voice over (she sounded like Penelope Cruz to me, if you heard it).</p>

        <p>Del Bigtree went through this a month or two ago. When he asked whether they were keeping records of who is vaccinated, the answer was no. He had two options: wait for a week for someone he knew for sure was unvaccinated to donate, or go to Mexico, where they are competent enough to keep track. He ended up getting a little bit of untainted blood, enough to get to fly elsewhere. I wouldn't trust it, but in the event of an emergency, you don't really have much choice. You may be able to find options, but you will probably be stuck with what you get unless you jump through enough hoops.</p>

        <p>A few interesting things to note from the pamphlet information:</p>
<p>Eligible blood donors who received a live attenuated COVID-19 vaccine or do not know what type of COVID-19 vaccine they received must wait two weeks before giving blood.</p>
<p>But then says on the information sheet: </p>
<p>There is no deferral time for eligible blood donors who are vaccinated with a non-replicating inactivated or RNA-based COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by AstraZeneca, Janssen/J&amp;J, Moderna, Novavax, or Pfizer.</p>
<p>So which is it? Deferral time or no deferral time?</p>
<p>Are there other C19 vaxes besides AstraZeneca, J&amp;J, Moderna, Novavax or Pfizer? If you don’t know which you received there’s a deferral time, but the only known vaxes are the ones above and there’s no deferral time for those vaxes.</p>
<p>Are there other vaxes administered under EUA we don’t know about that would cause them to say in one line 2 week deferral, and next say no deferral when the only vax we have are the known manufacturers which they state have no deferral time after administration?</p>

        <p>Interesting. I read that the spike protein or some components of Covid, or the vax goes to your bone marrow after infection (or the shot) and it activates when your body comes into contact with infection and recirculates. This may be a huge problem for blood donation.</p>

        <p>I looked into donating blood a while ago and there is a weeklong (or 2 weeks? I forget) deferral for people who’ve had a covid vaccine. I haven’t, but I asked out of curiosity. It might vary depending on where you donate, though.</p>
