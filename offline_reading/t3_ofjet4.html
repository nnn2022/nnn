<p>As for lack of censorship, I don't think it's racial. With all its faults, Twitter has been better than the others when it comes to Covid censorship, at least recently. Plenty of white folks tweeting similar stuff.</p>

        <p>I can attest. I was banned from Twitter for posting a snip from The BMJ a few months ago. Recently, I posted the same snip and...nothing...so far. </p>
<p>Although, I saw some lamenting going on over another doctor who was pushing Ivermectin. That seems to be the no-no on Twitter these days. They do not want people believing in Ivermectin.</p>

        <p>If you want an honest answer that's going to be a hard pill to swallow: he's chosen the right hill to die on, and we haven't. </p>
<p>We can change minds and win the battle of ideas if we choose to fight the right battles, and stop using fake news or fake science to defend our positions. Instead this sub (and the lockdown-skepticism community as a whole) downvotes comments that disagree even when they're right, and embraces antivax propaganda comprised of pseudoscience while outright rejecting facts, science, and data that we disagree with politically. We focus way too much on dancing nurses and memes and no one bothers to read skeptical critiques over scientific research that is being pushed under false pretenses by the media. And we believe (and propagate) anything that's presented to us as counterevidence without any skepticism whatsoever.</p>
<p>On one hand we're pro choice for not forcing businesses to require masks. On the other hand, we're anti-choice and want to actually ban companies from requiring masks. We're pro choice on vaccines. But some protesters are actively trying to prevent willing guinea pigs choose to get vaccinated. These are logically inconsistent positions.</p>
<p>We're being censored, frankly, because our community is made up of opinionated pseudointellectuals pushing their own political agenda with zero regard for reality. Zuby is sticking to facts and philosophical reasoning. Want to stop being censored? We're gonna need a whole lot of gatekeeping.</p>

        <p>I never said that. We all have different reasons for being here. But if your reason is a hidden political agenda and you're pushing bullshit that you know is false hoping that others will be too stupid to question, you're not doing yourself any favors. You're making your entire side look bad. Our opponents do this to try to get us censored or to make us look stupid. It's called a false flag attack.</p>

<p>I personally think masks are bullshit and no mandates or requirements should ever be permitted period. I personally think all the vaxxing for a disease that kills no one healthy is absurd and should be heavily restricted for absolute medical necessity. But those are just my opinions. </p>
<p>Some people are libertarians who think private businesses should be allowed to do whatever they want or individuals should be allowed to put whatever they want into their bodies. Some people are authoritarians, etc. </p>
<p>But as long as you’re opposed to the new normal you’re fucking a-okay in my book and it seems like a good idea to make that the only shared consensus here</p>

        <p>&rt;We can change minds and win the battle of ideas if we choose to fight the right battles, and stop using fake news or fake science to defend our positions.</p>
<p>How can you still act like such a fucking libertarian? Seriously? Your tactics don't work, it's a feel good line to give you hope while you give up more and more ground every single year. Your ideas won't win out at this point unless you control the distribution of media, but with pussies like you at the helm that will never happen. You lost your country a long time ago and you're in a psychological war that you're losing in a landslide. How can you possibly write what you write and not realize that the leftists are winning by propagating fake news and fake science? Do you want to win, or do you want to keep your ideals?</p>

        <p>Point. But are flat Earthers getting banned and fact checked as much, or does no one really care what they say? I couldn't care less if people think the world is flat or the vaccine is some kind of needlessly-convoluted tool of mass depopulation. It's no threat, and a few will always come up with out-there beliefs, it's just people being people.</p>
<p>I don't think r/lockdownskepticism is nearly as prone to this issue, either, and it's a lot more representative imo.</p>

        <p>This is the revised method of counting deaths in the UK. It was revised because:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8599213/Thousands-Covid-19-deaths-wiped-governments-official-toll-counting-fiasco.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8599213/Thousands-Covid-19-deaths-wiped-governments-official-toll-counting-fiasco.html</a>Academics found Public Health England's methods meant ministers count victims as anyone who died after ever testing positive for <strong>Covid-19 — even if they were hit by a bus after beating the disease months later.</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So they changed the definition and it is linked and quoted here:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/916035/RA_Technical_Summary_-_PHE_Data_Series_COVID_19_Deaths_20200812.pdf">https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/916035/RA_Technical_Summary_-_PHE_Data_Series_COVID_19_Deaths_20200812.pdf</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;A death in a person with a laboratory-confirmed positive COVID-19 and either:died within (equal to or less than) 60 days of the first specimen dateordied more than 60 days after the first specimen date, only if COVID-19 ismentioned on the death certificate<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;2) A death in a person with a laboratory-confirmed positive COVID-19 test and diedwithin (equal to or less than) 28 days of the first positive specimen date.The daily number represents new deaths reported to PHE in the 24 hours up to 5pm theprevious day. Report date does not necessarily equate to date of death as it may takeup to a week for deaths to be reported to PHE.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;PHE reporting of COVID-19 deaths: technical summary – 12 August 20207The PHE data series does not include deaths where COVID-19 is mentioned on thedeath certificate but a laboratory test was not carried out or failed. All deaths with apositive specimen (including at post-mortem) <strong>are counted regardless of the cause ofdeath</strong>, and then restricted based on the time frames listed above. This aims to providethe most comprehensive measure of mortality burden possible.</p>
<p><strong>"Regardless of the cause of death"</strong></p>
<p>See, when people get mad that you are counting bus accident victims as covid victims, you just change the definition to include them.</p>

        <p>I have a lot of respect for Zuby. Not just because he's fighting back against pharma's corruption of NIH and the CDC.</p>
<p>But also he recently hosted speakers from LGB Fightback who are advocating against the medicalization of children by the pharma industry pushing for teen transitioning. As a bi woman who's been watching events in the UK and US unfold I was very grateful that he shared their organization and gave them a platform, because when I went looking for anyone in LGB community who was speaking out against this... of course google results showed me nothing but pharma's woke agenda to gaslight parents into thinking that letting a vulnerable child develop through Eriksen's psychosocial stage of Identity vs Role confusion without guessing at their outcomes and intervening to obstruct their right to mature... was somehow bigotry and medical neglect. That somehow "gender clinics" are not pharma's modern version of conversion therapy, exploiting homophobia and LGB sympathizers while labeling it "inclusion". Deplatforming the voices of dissent from those who have detransitioned after criticizing a medical system that allowed to transition as teens... and calling the censorship necessary for "inclusion". Ousting women who speak against this as TERFs to be punched. Shaming men as misogynists. Shaming LGB as selfish and projecting.</p>
<p>How is it medical neglect to hold off on a major decision like gender reassignment until a child is old enough to understand the full ramifications? My god they might have broad shoulders? An adam's apple? Small hands? I have a big nose, dry elbows, adult acne, and creepy toes. If I find it devastating there's therapy for my distress. When it comes to the best studies, there is no evidence of “clinically significant changes” after sex reassignment.</p>
<p>Instead pharma injected trans activism with millions in funding, and rode off the back of the LGB movement... which is about the right to be sexually attracted to the same sex. What's my gender? A woman... I'm not reduced through sexual objectification to my sex's reproductive verbs like chest feeder, or menstruator, just as a man is not merely a penile ejaculator or sperm producer... Any LBG can attest to some feelings of gender role nonconformity, but we never meddled in a child's development, and we were able to emotionally mature to point that recognized that my "pants" doesn't make me a man anymore than my hair cut. The LGB that sit in stunned silence got to this point from gaslighting adults, narc tactics at debate, who claimed they had a right to do what they wanted with their own bodies. Fair enough. I don't stop an adult from stretching his earlobes, and the body modifiers are eccentric but they are adults. But trans activists started talking about children and how abusive it was to oppose chemical castration, or cutting the breasts off girls. Adult men are trying to assert some narcissistic entitlement to leave a door open to any antisocial spectrumed man who uses the password "self identification" to access spaces I am isolated in as I undress... Like heck was I going to be gaslit that my own boundaries are somehow oppressive bigotry, or that advocating for children's safety is somehow bigotry.</p>
<p>Pharma is promising that they will fight to make a lifetime patient before a teen is old enough to adequately make informed consent to a lifetime of health complications and medical bills. Never mind just Lupron (medically induced menopause) is $2000/month, or that the medical community can make 1 million over the course of a transitioners lifetime. Straight parents don't understand pharma's history exploiting HIV costs of treatment in the gay community, the lies and blocked treatments, and exorbitant price tags. Psychiatry's history exploiting homophobia through conversation therapies that promised to fix kids who may... Or may NOT wind up gay.</p>
<p>They advocate for inducing medical risks on a healthy child to include osteoporosis, infertility, possibility of a loss of orgasm function, growth stunting, hindering full potential of brain development (working memory), high blood pressure, multiple corrective surgeries after complications, rectovaginal wall perforations, risks with anesthesia and surgery, ischemia, clotting, stroke, infection, 20% risk of suicide in the 15 years after surgical reassignment, and this isn't even all of the risks. Now look up the risks... The majority of results try to bury it under political rhetoric surrounding how bigoted it is to ignore depression that occurs with gender dysphoria. We know the acute risks are tremendous while the long term remains unknown. How is that responsible or ethical medical recommendations for at risk populations like kids... Who cannot provide informed consent?</p>
<p>When Zuby gave LGB fightback a platform to speak, I had a tremendous amount of respect for him. This isn't something dividing the community. This is brainwashing children and young adults through media manipulation, while censoring any opposition that calls the science®️ and motivations into question.</p>

        <p>The original guidance to label everyone a covid victim, which this thread is about (which seemed to evade you), came from the WHO.</p>
<p>Public Health decided to follow that guidance and labelled everyone who died with a positive test as covid. Including bus crash victims. People pointed out that trauma cases should not be included, and so Public Health stopped following WHO guidance and said they would include everyone including trauma victims.</p>

<p>Either way you cut it, you don't have any info that can tell you whose right. If you dont trust the world leading organization regarding the subject than I assume you wouldnt be lucky enough to find the one group in the world that knows about. You know considering if we are talking conspiracies we have to assume that anybody can die at any moment for any reason and we will never know the true cause. So if you hate the truth that i believe so much how is your any better? What have you gained other than the fear that you are at war with a faceless enemy...</p>

        <p>A covid death is anyone that died WHILE HAVING COVID regardless of the true factors of death (ie cancer, diabetes, old age, etc ). </p>
<p>But when applied to vaccine every post-vaccination death is a “coincidence?” </p>
<p>Nah, pick one and stick with it. </p>
<p>Either we are in a pandemic with a highly deadly and failed vaccine OR we were never in a pandemic to begin with. Pick one- you don’t get to change the number rules for your convenience.</p>

        <p>It's not just the UK. Every single "Democracy" on earth is counting them this same way.</p>
<p>In the US it's within 60 days, not 28.</p>
<p>If we had tested everyone who died for Coronavirus in 2018, and listed that death as "Seasonal Flu" even though there were on average 4 other causes like Heart Attacks or Diabetes or Aneurisms... we would have the same crazy figures that COVID19 has.</p>
<p>COVID19 is just the flu, tracked in real time, and the method of counting was specifically changed to get the highest death toll possible.</p>

        <p>He and his family were barely scraping by as it was. There was no way he could have afforded a hotel. </p>
<p>Unfortunately he is no longer around, so I cannot ask him why he didn't choose to be homeless for weeks. </p>
<p>Perhaps, since he was so concerned about the possibly that he would infect others, he knew that he would have a hard time finding food and drink in order to survive. Not everybody has the ability to survive in the wild.</p>

        <p>That's the guidance from the WHO, but it isn't followed.</p>
<p><a href="https://denver.cbslocal.com/2020/12/15/grand-county-covid-deaths/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">https://denver.cbslocal.com/2020/12/15/grand-county-covid-deaths/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter</a>\&rt;The Grand County coroner is calling attention to the way the state health department is classifying some deaths. The coroner, Brenda Bock, says two of their five deaths related to COVID-19 were people who died of gunshot wounds.</p>
<p>The coroner receives 5 dead bodies for covid. Two obviously died from gunshot wounds but are marked "covid", the other three...who knows, but nothing would let the coroner know they were covid off-hand, they come with the same label as the gunshot victims.</p>
<p>Hospital receives 2 gunshot victims. Chances are, 2 young people who are likely to get into a shootout are not likely to be insured.  But, if the hospital adds "covid" then medicare covers all the fees + 20%. Two emergency surgeries, we are talking hundreds of thousands of dollars. Times hundred of thousands of cases.</p>
<p>How about the other 3 then? Same situation. When Portugal ruled they must only count directly attributable deaths, over 99% of the "covid" deaths disappeared. So, they say "not for trauma or other conditions" but then they pay for you to label them as such.</p>

        <p>Lol, you mean after getting caught, they spent more time hiding it? (Kind of like you)</p>
<p>So, the number of deaths presented in the article matches the number for worldometer for that period. There was no removal of 4000 deaths, The deaths from old folks home in Ontario, which were investigated and determined to be from neglect and not covid, can you show me where those numbers were removed from the count? Can you show me where 99% of Portuguese deaths that were determined not to be caused by covid were removed?</p>
<p>You said they were not counting trauma victims. Then you said the UK wasn't and now its the UK wasn't since this date and I bet if I look a bit more, you'll jump to the next excuse. How good are you feeling about your position right now?</p>

<p>Here is the official August 12 revision. This is the official document detailing it. </p>
<p>Can you explain to me what this means: "regardless of the cause of death"?</p>
<p>Like, for example, is getting hit by a bus a possible cause of death? Just not sure how your mind works.</p>

        <p>The UK incorporates the WHO definition:</p>
<p>A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma).</p>
<p>The UK also has:</p>
<p>Calculating the excess death rate</p>
<p>Another approach to assessing the impact of COVID-19 is to calculate the excess death rate. This method compares the total number of deaths in a week to the average expected from previous years. This is an excellent method, but it also takes some time for the results to be available.</p>
<p>Why do the public health figures differ from the ONS numbers?</p>
<p>PHE has been counting all deaths in people who have laboratory-confirmed infection – this is technically robust because it does not require a judgement to be made about cause of death. ONS reports deaths where a doctor suspects COVID-19 as a cause – these data include a clinical assessment as recommended by WHO but are subject to variation in clinical judgement as to the cause of death.
These are two different measures with different strengths and weaknesses. The PHE data series is also available daily, making it more useful for real-time surveillance, whereas the ONS survey only appears once a week and is delayed.</p>
<p>https://publichealthmatters.blog.gov.uk/2020/08/12/behind-the-headlines-counting-covid-19-deaths/  </p>
<p>Basically the ONS statistic for covid deaths are pretty accurate</p>

<p>This means the same thing and you've repeated it twice </p>
<p>The UK was counting all deaths as Covid until the 12th of August which on this date deaths that didn't meet the definitions were removed, I don't under how this is so hard for you to grasp</p>
<p>Looking at the UK definitions you would know that the ONS statistics use clinical assessments to judge the cause of death, so if someone gets hit by a bus and has covid it won't be counted as a covid death </p>

        <p>Ok, so your position is:</p>
<p>Since all deaths are related to covid:</p>
<p>"ONS doesn't count deaths that aren't related to covid."</p>
<p>Got it. I know. Including bus accidents and other trauma. Since these are "related to covid" according to the official definition, because all deaths with a positive specimen, even post-mortem (I like how they include that) are related to covid, regardless of cause.</p>
<p>Which completely contradicts your first comment:</p>
<p>"But deaths aren't counted as any reason, its any death within 28 days of a positive covid test besides other obvious causes of death e.g trauma"</p>
<p>I give the US, you say "but not UK"</p>
<p>I say "Bus death", you say "revised August 12th"</p>
<p>I show you the revised August 12th document and direct quote and you say "not trauma"</p>
<p>So essentially, you want to argue that trauma is impossible for someone who got a positive test, even after death. Ok, well, yeah, you are insane, so...</p>

<p>What I've said isn't hard to understand, the ONS (office of national statistics) doesn't include covid deaths that aren't related to covid, eg trauma. You're talking about the PHE statistics which I'm not.</p>

        <p>What you need to realise is I agree with you (for the most part) about what you're talking about but you're talking about a different set of statistics than I am, you're talking about PHE stats and I'm talking about the ONS stats</p>

        <p>I've provided you with links to what the definitions of a covid death is under the PHE and the ONS yet you still chose to ignore it. </p>
<p>I've been talking about the ONS the whole time and I haven't been wrong about anything regarding to the ONS stats and definitions, you choose to keep talking about the PHE stats which I agree do not filter out the deaths which aren't related to covid</p>

        <p>The article was in response to you saying any proof that the deaths were deducted, that's proof, doesn't matter what body the stats come from.</p>
<p>The ONS do get their stats from the PHE who are apart of the government as well, the ONS deduct further deaths based on the true cause after clinical examination etc.</p>

        <p>If non-COVID deaths are being coded as COVID deaths, how do you explain the fact that there are roughly 128,000 <em>more deaths overall</em> in the UK during the pandemic versus the historical average</p>

        <p>There are numerous studies done by government agencies, independent scientists and media organizations looking at excess death numbers, and they consistently show that if anything, official COVID death counts are an undercount of the virus's true toll. This is consistent across many, many different countries that have no reason to be colluding with each other. </p>

        <p>Welcome to pseudo-science. The first thing you need to know of actual science is that it has arguments against it. Pseudo-Sciences make it so you cannot argue with them, simply by saying “I’m right, if you disagree you are being bribed/brainwashed” They make it impossible to have an actual scientific discussion of the topic, because they are afraid that if they argue with the other side long enough, they might start to believe said other side. At least flat-earthers aren’t putting people in danger, like anti-vaxxers are. There is no big conspiracy. You talk of COVID echochambers while this entire sub is an echochamber. You’re not special, &amp; that’s ok. Not many of us are. Yet that doesn’t mean you need to tear down others to make a pile of bodies to work your  way up. You think you’re doing good when you’re only doing harm. We have recently hit 4 million total deaths, only 2 million away from the total of Jewish people that died in the Holocaust. I want to take a step back, get off that pedestal of bodies you put yourself on, &amp; look at everything from an unbiased perspective. Look at statistics, facts, news articles, &amp; then you can decide without biased, what you truly believe. If you still, after that, think it’s all a big government conspiracy, then you may go back to your pedestal of bodies, &amp; I admit failure in saving you. But if you change your mind, go &amp; try to change others minds, &amp; teach them the truth, with a power only gotten through personal experience.</p>
<p>That is all.</p>

        <p>&rt;The first thing you need to know of actual science is that it has arguments against it</p>
<p>Simple, when propaganda has to be massively implemented on a daily basis, while silencing the opposition, it is a scam. That's simple science and logic.  </p>
<p>Anti vaxxers? I'm not anti vaxxer, i'm just against the covid vaccine. Are you trying to dehumanize ppl like me? That is one of the big points, in nazi propaganda. Dehumanize those different to you, first step. Accuse them of being the guilt of your problems.<br>
Fact, if you are vaccinated for an illness, that illness shouldn't affect you anymore. If you are vaccinated for the flu, and I have the flu, technically, you shouldn't get it anymore. That's how vaccines work. They are a shield to protect yourself. So, if all the morons like you get vaccinated, ppl like me don't need it anymore. I don't expect ppl to wear masks, to social distance, or lock themselves up to "protect me" ... I like to live dangerous :) So, if you got your vaccine, what are you complaining exactly about, you ARE protected. Or are the vaccines scams that don't work?  </p>
<p>Talking about echo chamber, watch the worldwide mainstream media and news ... it's the biggest echochamber humans have witnessed since we exist on this planet :D Hitler and Stalin would have loved this modern era to do their propaganda ...   </p>
<p>Covid only kills old, weak, sick and fat. Basically, ppl that were meant to die within the year. As for 4 million, in more than a year and half ... is pretty low compared to the 120 000 000 births that have happened since last year :)</p>

        <p>It seems I’ve failed redeeming, &amp; can see why now. I do apologize for assuming you were an anti vaxxer. The thing with echo chambers is that all big groups are echo chambers, the only difference is if they’re spreading good or bad. It seems you entirely ignored my point on taking a step back &amp; looking at the situation through unbiased lens, which is a shame. Although it seems you are too far deep, considering that you show little to no care for anyone with disabilities or illnesses, which is what I took from the comment that “COVID only kills old, weak, sick, &amp; fat. Basically ppl that were meant to die within the year.” I truly hope you take a good look at yourself &amp; your ideals, &amp; come to realize all the wrongs you’ve caused, &amp; maybe you can even help right those wrongs. But for now, all I can say is that I’m sorry, &amp; I’ve failed you. Goodbye.</p>

<p>I'm against saving the lives of old, disabled and ill ppl, at the cost of healthy young ppl. You know, the nuked economy is not the problem of ill and old that will be death anyway, in a couple of years, and won't provide to the community while being alive. That ruined economy, will directly impact the future adults, that are children at the moment. My life is fucking done, i got everything i need and everything I want. That's something many children now, won't ever know in their life .. .for what? Saving a bunch of already dying ppl? Since when do we sacrifice the future, to save the past? Think again.</p>

<p>The wrongs I caused? You are literally doing what i told you in my last comment. You re putting your guilt, your flaws, on my back. Idiot. The global economic genocide going on, is because of idiots like you. And i take well care of myself, thanks for worrying. Now, the day ill be 70-80, i certainly wouldn't want anyone to save my life, to the detriment of a child. Even now, i wouldn't want it. Only very selfish or ignorant ppl, would sacrifice children to save old fat weak and genetic wrecks.</p>

        <p>You made a list, but the list is all the same data. You are trying to position it as independent, but it's not. </p>
<p>The government says: </p>
<p>"All deaths with a positive specimen (including at post-mortem) are counted regardless of the cause of death, and then restricted based on the time frames listed above"</p>
<p>That is how the data is collected and that is the same data used by all the sources you mentioned.</p>
<p>Now, we know that data includes people hit by buses. We know that the method of data collection is utterly unscientific. But, it is used by them all. </p>
<p>Then we have the covid doctors who are treating patients and say that they've treated 1400 patients with a 6% mortality rate. They go on to say the world average and the US average. This doctor is getting the worst patients around with covid symptoms and ensuring that around 94% live. </p>
<p>This I'm inclined to believe: he is onsite. He is treating them. He is coordinating with other doctors internationally. He is dealing with actual symptoms of covid, not gunshot victims or people who got hit by a car. </p>
<p>He's taking on the worst cases around and saving 94%. I would accept that as a case fatality rate (CFR). </p>
<p>As an infection fatality rate (IFR), I think antibody seroprevalence testing has done a sufficient job at giving us a lower limit of people infected globally to date. But they are including the enhanced death rate, but still find it to be 0.15% globally. So, I think that's an upper limit and decreasing over time.</p>

The data has nothing to do with covid ffs. It compares an average number of deaths in a given period from years prior and compares it to the number of deaths in 2020-2021. And it shows there were a significantly higher number of deaths in 2020 compared to years prior. Thats what excess deaths are. Unless there was any other major event last year that caused millions of deaths, its very likely that the number of excess deaths is the number of deaths as a result of coronavirus.</p>

        <p>You mean the same government that is defining covid deaths as:</p>
<p>"All deaths with a positive specimen (including at post-mortem) are counted regardless of the cause of death"</p>
<p>You mean that government? Oh, I trust them. I trust them to manipulate the data. That quote is them telling you exactly what they are going to do and I trust they did it. </p>
<p>Why don't you trust them?</p>
<p>They tell you they are counting gunshot victims, bus crash victims and they will even tell you they are trying to produce the scariest number. So, why don't you trust the people and they data that they tell you are providing in a specific way?</p>

        <p>Why do you feel the need to change my words and why no answer to my question?</p>
<p>Do you think someone who got hit by a bus and died instantly died of covid?</p>
<p>In the UK, for it to be listed as a covid death, they do a post-mortem test. This is the same test kids in the uk have been squirting fruit juice on to get a positive result. So, please, just yes or no, let's keep it simple and honest.</p>

        <p>Okay firstly it isn't the same test, for a positive covid test to be recorded it has to be with a PCR test, not a lateral flow test, which have been used for mass testing (A positive lateral flow test is followed up with a PCR test to ensure it wasn't a false positive).  </p>
<p>I think its a bad argument to talk about death from injury anyway because that is an extremely small proportion of deaths - it's usually much more complicated, such as someone with lung damage who catches covid and dies from respiratory failure. Was it covid or was it the lung damage? Chances are it was a bit of both but covid most likely contributed to the death so its recorded as such.  </p>
<p>That being said, I don't actually give a toss about what the government classes as a covid death because you're right - it can potentially be an over or underestimate, and there isn't much consistency between countries - so looking at excess deaths is a much more reliable metric, and that shows there were significantly more deaths in 2020 than in previous years. I'll leave it to you to connect the dots.</p>

        <p>&rt;positive covid test to be recorded</p>
<p>Not true. They don't even need a test in many places. </p>
<p>\&rt;I think its a bad argument to talk about death from injury anyway because that is an extremely small proportion of deaths </p>
<p>Overall, but not in kids. Their death rate matches the statistical possibility that they would die in any 28 day period. As you get older, this correlation disappears, but essentially all deaths in kids and most in people under 30 are mere covid deaths by definition. As for the bulk of covid deaths, they had a short life expectancy at the time of death: ie, there should be no excess deaths for them.</p>
<p>\&rt;so looking at excess deaths is a much more reliable metric</p>
<p>Determined by the exact same people who came up with the catch-all definition of a covid death. They know their catch-all definition was bullshit. Hmm, now they are going to furnish the evidence against themself with a valid excess death count? Interesting conspiracy theory you have there.</p>

        <p>The age standardised mortality rate per 100,000 for the uk has more people dying in 2008 than they did in 2020. Yes, its a bit weird that 2020 had the highest number of deaths in 12 years, but its not that weird. There were excess deaths caused by lockdown side effects e.g. suicide, plus maybe lockdown encouraged binge drinking and eating, and some of those deaths were probably caused by the slightly more dangerous flu variant. Is it really worth locking down the entire world because we now live in an environment thats less dangerous than the year 2005?? 2003 wasn’t too bad was it, so why are we so scared now when we live in a world where there is less death than we had back then.</p>
