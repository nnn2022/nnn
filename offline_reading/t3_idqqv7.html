    <strong>Discussion About The " Doomers " And Astroturfing In The " New Normal "</strong>
    <p><p>There has been a wave of " doomers " in the past few weeks trying to normalize masks, pretend like we can't win our lives back, claiming more people wear masks when it's the opposite, etc. Most people in this sub seem to think it's genuine human traffic, there sock puppet accounts and bots, fake outrage is an online phenomenon now. The " doomers " rationalizing the hoax or shitting on people online for not believing into the hoax are paid shills. <a href="https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/players/harrington.html">https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/players/harrington.html</a> . The COO of Edelman was in the Event 201 video saying we have to flood the zone about covid on social media... </p>
<p>Here are some articles on this subject.</p>

<p>I Quote : Companies such as Uber and Coca Cola use several major PR companies including Edelman Communications, Cohn &amp; Wolfe and Morrow Communications. Those are professional companies with trained people to defend client companies. They find thread using Google Alerts with the keyword "Uber" "Taxi" "Coke" "Soda". They are usually here within minutes. Other clients have keywords alerts such as M-0N_S@_T0.</p>
<p>Several Uber whisleblowers have confirmed they are doing this. Uber provides the firms with a list of arguments such as "Uber is a good job for drivers, if you don't make any money as a driver you personally just suck" or "Politicians are bribed by the powerful taxi lobby" while attacking anyone explaining how Uber and it's shareholders (Goldman Sachs/Google) have huge political power as crazy conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p>Coca-Cola does the same astroturfing about soda. Any thread about soda taxes gets bullshit argument such as <em>"it's a tax to fund political corruption"</em>, <em>"fuck the nanny state"</em> or <em>"it's against constitutional freedom"</em> Public health advocates highlighting how society pays for huge obesity rates through <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/obesity-prevention-source/obesity-consequences/economic/">lower productivity,  higher premiums, higher medical spending</a> get violently attacked.</p>
<p>What's happening on reddit is just manipulation on a massive scale. And it works.</p></p>

        <p>Nope, I've seen in real life the vast majority of people wearing masks voluntarily even when "socially distanced" outside, and I'm in a relatively middle of the road area, so it's not just astroturfing.</p>

        <p>I think the argument is that those people have been influenced by astroturfing, whether directly or by its rippling effects through social media and IRL.</p>
