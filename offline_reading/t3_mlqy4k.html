<title>With the news that all Americans aged 16 and up are eligible for the vaccine as of April 19, does anyone else think the rapid expansion of eligibility is because there is significantly less “buy in” for the vaccine than what was anticipated by the government?</title>

    <strong>With the news that all Americans aged 16 and up are eligible for the vaccine as of April 19, does anyone else think the rapid expansion of eligibility is because there is significantly less “buy in” for the vaccine than what was anticipated by the government?</strong>
    <p><p>First, the whole convoluted system of groups based on age, risk factors, and profession was pretty much scrapped and they were taking anyone in a broad age group. Now, they are already making it available to pretty much everyone. On one hand, they are touting the <em>rate</em> at which they are vaccinating (up to 3 million per day, last I heard), but I suspect they are starting to hit a point where they aren’t having as many people as they expected. From a marketing perspective, if they can maintain momentum and “good news,” it may sway people on the fence to acquiesce. I think they are actually getting close to vaccinating all of the people who are eager to get vaccinated and they are afraid the news cycle is going to turn from this huge success of mass inoculation to something along the lines of “only 50% of people are vaccinated and the vaccine centers are empty.”  </p>
<p>There was a recent poll showing that almost half of republicans were not actively seeking the vaccine. Of course, that’s only half of like a third of the country, but I think if you drill into the cross-tabs more, there are probably some substantial pockets of people from all kinds of ideological backgrounds that have no intention of getting the vaccine. And with states rolling ahead with re-opening plans, a vaccine effort that stalls well short of the stated goals is going to cause even more of a rift between people, businesses, governments, and who knows what else. Maybe it’s just a misplaced gut feeling, but my feeling is that the harvest isn’t going much further than the low-hanging fruit.</p></p>

        <p>First they rolled out artificial scarcity. Then a tier program of who is allowed. Then they "grudgingly" open it up to everybody. With a special push for mandatory school vaccine campaigns.</p>

<p>if i die from a common cold corona virus so be it, if someone's granny 3,000 miles or 30 feet away dies then so be that as well.</p>
<p>the reality is, where i live, that this common cold is beyond low, so how common can it be?</p>
<p>i digress, they are swimming in not vax doses, the uptake was lower than projected</p>

        <p>That's why they're now testing the vaccine on children, who will do whatever they're told and won't be allowed to get a school degree if their parents don't comply.</p>
<p>It's already happening in Israel, the government was saying that the infection numbers among children where exploding (but that's because they were reporting it as percentage so that's total bs), and they told teenagers they couldn't pass their final exam if they didn't get vaccinated (after a year of online educating and examination).</p>

        <p>One lady said she got it and she's "not dead yet". Some said they were already there (where the vaccine was being given) so "might as well". I'm lucky the the people I work with are pretty respectful of others' decisions. It sucks for me though because I do actually care about all of them and don't want them to die young because of one small decision that took 2 seconds to put in their body. Many  things that cause people to die early are lifestyle things that people do over and over for years. This only takes one little second. And I can relate. Years ago my work offered the Hep B vaccine for free and I got it. I wouldn't do it now. The thing that sucks about vaccines in general is each one only prevents 1 illness. In the case of the flu vaccine they have to predict what strain will be abundant that flu year. I think I've heard it's never been correctly predicted. That means all risk and no reward.</p>

        <p>Lol honestly most people who were going to get it probably have by now no? There are more people than it seems who see the obvious propaganda and won’t take it.

        <p>My mom and brother's dad are staunch Democrats but opposed to the vaccine. Mom recently told me one of her friends got sick after the second shot. Her friend is in her late 40s though.</p>
<p>Initially healthcare workers were among the first to be offered it. I work in the field and a lot of us don't want the vaccine. At least here in the Carolinas anyway. I am guessing they fell short of the goal to get all of the healthcare workers vaccinated.</p>
<p>I also believe this vaccine is being hyped up and used to manipulate the masses even more. It's kinda fishy how aggressively this is now being pushed.</p>

        <p>The % of people in the US who have been vaccinated will soon be posted on CNN on the like the death toll was and they will use public shaming / peer pressure to manage that %.  </p>
<p>Sales forecast for the vaccine assumes nearly everyone takes it.  Now that the uptake is going to slow as the younger are eligible they need to protect the sales - and they need to do it before everyone realizes they should go back to normal without a vaccine.</p>

        <p>Got hired to work the county's health departments vaccination clinics when the vaccine first came out. I only worked a handful of times because the demand just wasn't there which led to the county receiving less vaccines. They ended up going from vaccinating 5 days a week to 2.5 day to make it seem like appointments were hard to come by and then ultimately laying off hundreds of people they hired. </p>
<p>The biggest vaccinated groups are healthcare workers and long term care residents. Once it opened up to people outside of healthcare, the demand just wasn't there despite what it seems. Hence, all the vaccine passport talk to push people in thale direction of getting the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Basic supply/demand economics. When there is high demand, price goes up! If price is controlled, then there are shortages &amp; rationing. (70s gas lines) </p>
<p>If a good or service has high supply/ low demand, then price drops or incentives have to be made to entice people to take it. (again, 70s had 'free gifts' for opening a bank account, or now Covid jab with free donuts) </p>
<p>Next step in dealing with low demand/high supply is legal force. (insurance)</p>
<p>The truly crazy thing is the government is all but outright saying these 'vaccines' are completely useless. By government claim- it will NOT prevent infection or spread, it is NOT effective against 'variants' &amp; those vaccinated still MUST adhere to all Covid measures anyway. At very best that they offer is when you get Covid, if vaccinated, you might not die. Although the vaccine might kill you... Hardly reassuring!</p>
