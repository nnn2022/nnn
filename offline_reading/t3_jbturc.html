        <p>About every 100 persons I see walking the street (no mandate and zero risk) less than one is wearing them improperly. So yeah around 99% at least. Everywhere else it's the law. So given this, there is 100% mask compliance just for businesses and public transportation to operate. 100+99= 199</p>
<p>If we are using covid zoning controls, each business district comprises of both business and pedestrian activity. So relative to each district speaking , a combined 199% compliance is taking place. This translates to 99.5% (average) mask compliance in each district. However, this has very little impact on positives cases per covid hotspots controlled by business district zones. </p>
<p>You can search [NYC covid zone] to find zone data. They have no way to accumulate mask compliance other than mandates and video surveillance. However my own surveillance shows that less than 1 out of 100 pedestrians in certain "covid hotspots" are wearing masks improperly in NON-mandated public spaces and 100 out of 100 patrons MUST wear a mask to buy, sell and travel. </p>
<p>If your arguement is that "there is no way to properly aggregate mask compliance data ", then you just prove my point that there is no evidence to suggest that lack of compliance is linked to mask usage.  </p>
<p>My observations aren't set to prove anything. They do however, aim to show contradictions between compliance and mandates which  are arbitrary, and borderline classist, ethnocentric and racist given that business districts and zones are populated by target demographics.</p>

        <p>Law does not equal compliance. But let’s go with it. The result from 99.5% compliance is we have had an increase in infection rate over the past month. It sounds like you’re suggesting that we are not doing enough to stop the spread of covid. What additional steps should we be taking?</p>

        <p>&rt;suggesting that we are not doing enough to stop the spread of covid</p>
<p>No where did I suggest this. This is an assumption. I clearly stated that </p>
<p>1) we don't have enough data to properly make additional steps</p>
<p>2) the mandates and compliance are completely unrelated. Mandates are now being enforced through case numbers, which have their own set of variables. </p>
<p>&rt;an increase in infection rate over the past month.</p>
<p>Again. You are spuriously correlating the two, which is a logical fallacy. It's a flat out lie that keeps being repeated over and over as truth. 2 graphs are going the same direction means nothing especially if the conclusion existed before the observation. So now each observation is used to support the conclusion,  which was baseless from the start. It's called circular logic. Stop calling it science. </p>
<p>&rt;Law does not equal compliance.</p>
<p>It actually does. You cannot even walk into a store without a mask. We can entertain this and say that both in and out of mandated areas 99% instead of 99.5% are complying.  My point is, we don't have a means to measure infection rate against these variables.  None. Track and trace is security theater. It's based on a baseless conclusion made on non-existent data. See my second comment.</p>

        <p>Stop scaring people that a 1.04% positivity rate is bad. Publish more articles like The NY Times did this summer about how good the ventilation system is on the subway. Remind people that unless you’re over 70 or immunocompromised this is equivalent to the flu.</p>

        <p>This is way out of scope and it's still founded on another baseless conclusion. The conclusion that covid rates CAN be reduced. See how slippery this is? </p>
<p>But to entertain this: let's say that we kept the current mandates. There isnt much more we can do based on the current resources.  According to them "all of this works", so if it works,  then why do they use their data to reinforce more lockdown. They have no proof that it because of non compliance. Its literally based on nothing but at the very least, fear, which came from the govs own lips. </p>
<p>We do not have enough data to know how exactly it is spreading. We don't have the technical means to do this. There is no app to track the virus. That's a complete lie. All we can do is track cases, which have their own set of variables including methological flaws. </p>
<p>The original goal was to close down for 14 days to keep hospitals from overwhelming, not decimate entire sectors of business and usher in a "new normal".</p>

        <p>My arguement is, using cases as a means to define mandates is bad faith. Mandates were created to keep hospitalizations down (not that this wasn't also baseless), not to be used to punish zones for "non-compliance" (false pretense) of  mandates that also have no correlation to spread based on current data.</p>

        <p>&rt;infection rate </p>
<p>This is not data based on spread or even infection, but positive cases, based on variables such as testing and methodology, which add additional sub-variables. testing alone does nor provide us with any data that conclude that  mandates and spread are related </p>
<p>&rt;We have the infection rate from the beginning when masks were not in place and we have current infection rates with masks.</p>
<p>This is called a spurious correlation.  Frankly I'm tired to having to explain this. No where in any science or business practice is such a lazy conclusion be drawn from spotty data, and shifting variables yet here we are, dishing out mandates and destroying autonomy and business economies based on this. You seem to have an over simplistic understanding on what amount of information is needed to confirm whether something is true or not and the government seems to be dependent on this level of ignorance.</p>

        <p>I also love to bring up the point that those who aren’t complying are actually the ones who are most likely to help speed this up and get it over with. </p>
<p>The virus isn’t going anywhere. The point of flatten the curve was literally to drag out the cases and deaths so as not to overwhelm hospitals. It literally means to drag this out longer and spread the cases and deaths out over a longer period of time. I love when someone says “non compliance is making this go on longer” like no, your stupid restrictions are making this go on longer because that was the entire point of them.</p>
