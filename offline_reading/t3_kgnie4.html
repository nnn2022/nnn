    <strong>The big problem isn’t the masks, it’s the way we’re being treated.</strong>
    <p><p>This cannot be the new normal. That is what this subreddit is for, but I’ve also seen people complaining about, what I think, are irrelevant complaints. Like how they can go visit their third mansion in the Bahamas anymore. I feel like some people are targeting the government as the only villain. </p>
<p>This disease wasn’t made by the government for two simple reasons:
     1. They are losing money. For every business that closes, they lose people to tax. Every time someone can’t buy something tax dollars are lost, and business as a whole slows heavily. One of the reasons certain people of power want us to go out and buy things anyway, so they can make money again. 
     2. If it was a conspiracy we would know about it. The government isn’t one entity, they are different groups all wanting the power our votes give them, thus if this was a conspiracy one of the parties would tell us that was the case. </p>
<p>The real villain is, as always, those with power over others but lacking the power to let it go. Not the government. Our vote holds too much power over them for us to be left in the dark. Billionaires companies (for example Amazon) that don’t give their honest employees the safety they need are the problem. The CEOs worth trillions don’t stop raking it in while our businesses close. If I could get payed in full while my store was <em>temporarily</em> closed that would be fine, but the tax dollars that we have payed aren’t doing that, they’re helping the rich not have to pay their own taxes. That’s why I don’t think the government should reduce taxes, because right now they should be our saving grace. We should all be safely taken care of by the money that we payed <em>specifically</em> so that we could just stay home and relax on a comfortable wage while we wait it out. </p>
<p>TLDR: Big companies are the true villain of this story. Our tax dollars are used so rich people don’t have to play tax, when they should be used to help us. Amazon stays at full force endangering its employees so the rich can get richer, while small businesses close. With little support from our government when this is the reason we have taxes, this situation is unliveable. And that it why it CANNOT be our new normal!</p></p>

        <p>Yes and our current president gets payed for that, but he’s also hiring his family and replacing people who have actual jobs so he can pump as much money into hiring them as he can. On top of cutting taxes on the 1%, which effectively pulls more money that could be spent on keeping the rest of us afloat in quarantine. That is literally the enemy of this whole subreddits cause.</p>

        <p>The media is an iffy subject, as I don’t feel like they are a massive problem. Thankfully it isn’t completely government controlled (as that would be a big not good), and as long as you fact check through trustworthy sources it isn’t going to impede seeking the truth. For example the Russian media is government controlled and was able to convince a large amount of their population that the Ukrainiens <strong>bombed themselves</strong>.</p>
