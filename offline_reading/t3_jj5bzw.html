    <strong>My thoughts on the COVID-19 Pandemic...</strong>
    <p><p>First of all, let me tell you guys some things about COVID-19 that you guys spew out of your mouths whenever the topic comes up:</p>
<p>"YoU aRe So PaRaNoId.": I love this strawman you guys make of us. We are not living in fear. We're just taking the right safety precautions and making the most of a bad situation. Now, I'm not denying that some people are fearful at the moment. But they usually have anxiety. And making fun of them for it is a little insensitive, don't you think?</p>
<p>"ThE ViRuS oNlY kIlLs 1% Of PaTiEnTs.": It is true that COVID patients are more likely to survive than die. Unfortunately, even if you survive, there's a chance you could suffer permanent lung, heart, or vascular damage. I don't think you'd want that. Also, if all 328 million Americans catch COVID-19, that means that 3.28 million Americans will die. That's 16.4 times more people than our current COVID death toll which is #1 in the world. Not a good thing to be #1 in. Just saying.</p>
<p>"It'S jUsT a FlU!": I've heard people say this about COVID-19. My response to these people is: Are you actually serious? COVID-19 is way more contagious than the flu. We already have a flu vaccine and most rational people will get one during flu season. We don't have a vaccine for COVID yet. In the meantime, we just have to wear masks, stay 6 feet away from the nearest person, and only go outside when we need to.</p>
<p>"MaSkS dOn'T wOrK!": This is fairly easy to debunk. All you have to do is sneeze without a mask on and then sneeze with a mask on and you will see that the person who didn't have the mask on will have more particles on the tissue than the sneeze with the mask on. The whole point of the mask is more about preventing the spread of COVID if you are asymptomatic. Yet, you guys outright refuse to put on a mask claiming that it makes you strong if you don't. No. Wearing a mask shows you have intelligence and care enough about the safety of your fellow man that you don't want them to suffer just like how you don't want to suffer yourself. It's called empathy. Maybe you should try it sometime. Oh, wait. You can't. Because you are incapable of empathy.</p>
<p>"ThE mEdIa Is hYpInG iT uP!": In a way, I always complain that the news media is too negative and I've ranted about it on social media. However, there are times when the news has to be negative. Particularly during Earth-shattering events like 9/11 and COVID-19 when these events will most likely impact our daily routines and how we view life as we know it.</p></p>

<p>Masks have shown not to work in both mask mandates states and RCT clinical trials </p>
<p>Masks only prevent Large droplets but the smaller droplets which are 0.06 microns, can't get filtered, I've also done my own tests with masks and I'll breathe through it and moisture and small germs from my mouth will end up on my hand meaning the small particles still penetrate (the particles we should blockout) </p>
<p>With long term post people seem to heal in 3 months you may have the rare case which doesn't but very rare </p>

<p>And the flu vaccine has multiple studies that it can increase risk of other respatory illnesses by 35% </p>

<p>Theirs also a big correlation between countries with high flu vaccination rates and higher covid deaths</p>

        <p>Covid isn't more contagious than the Flu. Where are you getting that nonsense from? First, get the facts.</p>
<p>October 2018 to Feb 2019, CDC reported 18-20 million Flu illnesses. That's 2.5x the official number. And that's in a span of 5 months rather than 7 as with Covid.</p>
<p>Actually if you look at the high end of their estimates they admit it could be high as 45 million.</p>
<p>Let's look at the ridiculousness of what you are saying. If Covid is more <em>contagious than the Flu, you are admitting that actual cases are greater than 50 million.</em></p>
<p>200K divided by 50 million, that's 0.4% no? And that's with average age of deaths being 80 or so?</p>
<p>You ARE paranoid. For majority of us it is A FLU. The media IS hyping it up.</p>

        <p>The Basic Reproduction Number is the number that reveals a virus's contagion level.</p>
<p>The Flu has a BRN of 1.3. COVID-19 has a BRN of 2-2.5. This may seem like a small difference, but when you look at the big picture, it means that those with the flu will get 1-2 extra people sick. After 10 rounds, that's 56 sick. With COVID, after 10 rounds, that's an additional 2,047 sick.</p>
<p>It is true that both the flu and COVID have similar symptoms so it's understandable that people make this comparison. But they're not the same thing. Hell, they're not even in the same family of viruses.</p>

<p>Taking a virus with the level of severity that we are isn't paranoia. Not taking this virus seriously can make this problem far worse than it has to be.</p>
