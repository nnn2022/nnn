        <p>I love how they think they are in the clear after the immediate reactions (sore arm, flu) when that would be the LEAST of my concerns. Meanwhile their bodies have been transformed into spike protein factories and there is no long term data for the effects of this on the body, not to mention synthetic mRNA packages and whatever else kind of ungodly poison floating around. Such morons.</p>

        <p>Isn’t it fucking crazy that there’s like 4+ variations of the vaccine just in the US and people are just all cool with that? Don’t they presumably work the same way? Are they comprised of different things? Imagine having 6 different versions of the flu shot that you picked based on what your favorite pharma company is. Fucking nuts</p>

        <p>They don’t all work through the same mechanism although some do. The AstraZeneca vaccine works by injecting DNA into the cell nucleus via a non replicating adenovirus, which is then turned into mRNA. The mRNA tells the cell how to make the spike protein, which your body then develops an immune reaction to. The Pfizer vaccine works by directly injecting mRNA into your cells to produce the spike protein. Currently information suggests that it is safe to mix these vaccines, and that it can actually result in a better immune response.  </p>

<p>Also there are actually loads of different flu vaccinations each year, which protects against different strains and operate in different ways, and there are different manufactures who make them. </p>

<li>
<p>Nobody knew for certain if any were going to be effective prior to trials</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many offer benefits over the others such as being able to be stored at regular temperatures, or having longer shelf lives, or only requiring one dose. There are different markets for these vaccines which pharma companies recognised</p>

        <p>I don’t think anyone still knows how effective they are considering people are getting positive cases while vaccinated including several people I know personally. When you also consider potential side effects I just don’t really understand why anyone would get vaccinated if they don’t prevent you from getting covid? Are we going to need another or several booster shots to supplement the original two doses? </p>
<p>So much is up in the air that to me there’s no logical reason to get a vaccine especially since I already had covid. (Which I got wearing a mask every single day like it was glued to my face but I still was working for chump change like an actual idiot because I thought my company cared enough to provide me with a job) With my personal experience and empirical evidence I would not recommend anyone under the age of like 50 that’s healthy to get it. I wouldn’t really recommend anyone get it but I suppose it makes the boomers feel better so they can be the test subjects. 99 % survival rate</p>

        <p>Currently the best information we have suggests that the current available vaccines are effective. These numbers are not 100% (with old people having higher rates of infection) which does result in some vaccinated individuals getting sick, however even in those cases it is shown that the vaccine reduces the danger of the disease to the infected individual by strengthening their immune response.</p>
<p>Most talk around booster shots is because we don’t know how long the vaccines are effective for, and we don’t know how effective they are against new strains of Covid. We only have data from when the vaccines were initially developed which means we only know they continue to be effective because of ongoing studies. If any of those indicate that the immune response is weakening then we need to talk about booster shots. It’s entirely possible we may need them annually like flu shots if it’s shown the virus mutates frequently enough and in ways that invalidate previous vaccination.</p>
<p>Overall it’s your medical decision but currently doctors recommend getting them if you are over the age of 16 and healthy.</p>

        <p>I personally will not be taking any covid vaccines at least until the trial periods are over and probably not after that even but I respect you for actually debating me. I’m not worried about dying of covid so that alone will be my main reason for not getting one but I suppose we’ll see who was right in a few years.</p>

        <p>That’s currently where we are at for many people. It’s gonna take a while before anyone is going to be able to claim that they without a doubt are correct. I do think there is a net benefit to society when people are vaccinated, but I don’t blame anyone for being hesitant about this decision and wanting to wait.</p>

        <p>Yeah until there was information to suggest it was safe, the companies recommended against mixing. However as time has progressed they now have studied the effects of specific vaccines and decided it was safe for select combinations. This really isn’t a whole lot different than companies conduction medicine interference studies before saying they are safe for use in combination.</p>

        <p>Do you have any sources for the companies saying it's safe? I haven't seen anything like that.</p>

        <p>A lot of this stuff has literally come out yesterday so it’s pretty darn new info. People are taking it slow and some govts are still recommending that you stick to the same vaccine unless there are shortages. But it’s not surprising to hear people talking about people taking both AZ and Pfizer since that combination is the most throughly researched. </p>
