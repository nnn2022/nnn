        <p>The anti-marijuana propaganda is still strong in the west. Big Alcohol and Big Tobacco flooded the culture with junk science and fear-mongering BS.<br>
Cannabis has been with our species for tens of thousands of years as possibly <em>the</em> most widely used plant for any variety of uses across all of human history. It's had such an impact on our species that we have an entire Endocannabinoid system that specifically interacts with cannabinoids and nothing else. We co-evolved over thousands of generations with this plant and it became a cultural, spiritual, and biological part of our development- now people who sell Formaldehyde sticks want to tell you it's a "dangerous drug".</p>

        <p>Very interesting, I didn't know this! I wonder if dogs used to eat hemp similar to how they eat grass now. Grasses weren't very common in their evolutionary tract. Although, this seems to be at odds with the reason why they actually eat grass, as it induces vomiting and clears their digestive system. Cannabinoids should reverse that effect, inhibiting vomiting. But, maybe this link is not well understand and more complex? I'd be very interested in any resources you could suggest for further reading, I greatly appreciate the response.</p>

        <p>I mean as someone who grew up smoking almost daily, I would absolutely put it right alongside netflix and social media and all that other garbage. It’s just cheap dopamine like all the rest of them. Quitting daily smoking was one of the many steps I took in becoming a better person, alongside daily exercise, eating better, avoiding couch time, etc. I still nibble an edible every once and awhile for fun but as a habit (like most things) it’s absolutely detrimental to healthy living</p>
<p>But yeah put tobacco and alcohol on that list as well</p>

        <p>There is nothing wrong with those three (maybe except for the smell) if it is in moderation - of course what "moderation" means is strongly dependent on the specific individual. And in general on the genetics.</p>
<p>I come from central Europe, as far as I can trace my ancestors (over 400 years at least) they lived in this region and people here simply needed extreme tolerance to alcohol as a landlocked region without an access to quality water all over the place genetically selects for people who can tolerate a lot of alcohol. During epidemic outbreaks in the past, it was the only way to survive. Simply drink beer or anything else that provides sterile drinking fluid. I can drink about as much as a small Japanese village and still handle it. I have no tolerance to tobacco or weed as my genetics were not selected for that drugs.</p>

        <p>I think the general idea is to get off social media, turn off the the tv, eat healthy and get some exercise….which IMO is good advice. Reddit itself is full of doomer shit. Every “news” article posted is how COVID is killing everyone and we all need the jab, the climate is irreversibly damaged and we’re all gonna die, etc etc. Same goes for MSM, CNN especially (though Fox is bad too). You’d honestly think the world is literally going to end tomorrow just looking at the CNN front page….don’t get caught up too much in the things in the circle (I mean I’m posting on Reddit after all)….but in general, my life and mental health has been a lot better when I cut back on social media and turned off the news (I only watch a little local news here and there)</p>

        <p>I said it before and I will say it again - if you live a healthy lifestyle, porn is absolutely no threat to you and will not cause you any trouble.</p>
<p>If you feel exhausted, depressed and ashamed after masturbation to porn, it is not the fault of the porn. Maybe stop eating junk food, instead of chips have a carrot, instead of watching netflix go for a swim and instead of a cigarette go visit a friend. Then your life will change and masturbation to a lady on the screen will be just something you do to relief your organism because of natural desire. Not a problem the society should be debating.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of data pointing to porn causing ED in young men in addition to other problems</p>
<p>And it makes sense when you understand that the brain wasn’t designed for near infinite sexual stimulation via porn which tricks it into thinking you’re actually Mating with these girls </p>

        <p>Pretty much all the data come from "christian" universities, some from feminists and other interest groups.</p>
<p>Where I live we don't have those, we don't have that sort of research (even though some American research was translated) and porn - at least in our generation - was something normal, available to anyone since childhood. </p>
<p>Results?</p>
<p>Crime levels are down, violent crime is massively down, rape is down, people are in general healthier, live longer, divorce rate is not much higher than it was in the previous generation, less children are in institutional care than before (more are with families).</p>

        <p>Sorry to burst your bubble and I get your good intentions but ... porn is seriously damaging. As a woman, I hate how women are just viewed as a commodity, as mere sexual objects to jerk off to. This is what porn does, rewire the way you think about women, behave around women and treat women. It isn't a sheer coincidence that most of the youth is caught up in 'gender' fights, have young naive teens contemplate about opening up an OnlyFans and have most of them be depressed DUE to porn since they build such high expectations on what a relationship is supposed to be look like. It's also pretty worrying because most healthy adults, such as you, do not even consider all the illegal stuff that's on these websites. They don't consider that really young kids can and ARE sadly coming across these things due to poor parenting, control and media.. Honestly, I could go on and on. I feel so much better having quit this trash nearly a whole year ago. Also most of the popular pornstars wouldn't even support this sub, so they can go all fuck themselves (which they do anyway 😉)</p>

        <p>Blaming porn for bad depiction of women is like blaming movies for racism. Sure, there are bad ones, but that doesn't mean anything.</p>
<p>I watch porn since my childhood. I'm in my 30s, I have family, I love my wife and I always treated women as equals - in fact for generation in our family (and I would say in our regional culture) women were encouraged to pursue their dreams same as men.</p>

        <p>Couldn't agree more. I'll admit to trying it in high school and using on/off for like.. a year or two when I could acquire it, but even at 16 I could tell what that shit does to you long term. No, it's not going to kill you, but I don't need a peer reviewed study to tell me that having short term memory loss for extended periods of time on a weekly basis is unhealthy for your brain. I look at my brother and see how lazy, unproductive and aimless he is in life, and all I can do is see a picture of what I may have been like had I not realized how bad it is for you.. I try to get him to stop but he is so fucking addicted it seems beyond help. (Yes, you can be psychologically addicted you numb-nut stoners.)</p>

There are many different kinds of cannabis, and there are many different kinds of users. Just like alcohol, tobacco, there are people who can handle it and people who can't. Don't stereotype every single person in a group that likely contains hundreds of millions just because you know one person who's an addict.</p>

Stereotypes exist for a reason, because as much as you don't want to believe it, patterns ARE reality. Outliers exist sure, but I'm not placing my bets on outliers, I'm placing it on averages.</p>

        <p>You're literally using an outlier to make a generalized case about a group of people. Addicts are the outliers, cannabis is the most widely used drug on the planet and the vast majority of people you wouldn't even know. You're an ignorant fool if you think alcohol isn't orders of magnitude worse- both in terms of the rate of addictions and the adverse effects. It's the same for nicotine and caffeine.</p>

        <p>Alcohol is much worse. Caffeine/nicotine much less so, but are still bad for you especially in the addiction category. We are in agreement there. However, you can't sit here and tell me that weed isn't bad for you just because it's widely used and accepted. It kills brain cells, it damages working memory, it makes you slow, dull, and dependent upon its effects. If you honestly believe that weed is good for you, you're addicted psychologically. At least learn to admit it and I might at least respect your opinion. </p>
<p>Edit: Furthermore, I only know two stoners. My brother, and an old friend (we had a falling out.) I have a data set of 2, and both of them are unmotivated/quite lazy in general. Given my data set (from experience), outliers don't even exist. I have never met a successful stoner in real life. No, I don't care what research says, or what you say, or what the TV/internet says, I see with my own two eyes a pattern, and I respond to it accordingly.</p>

        <p>You are spouting pure propaganda on the effects of cannabis. The "science" that you are referring to was done in the 60's and 70's by tobacco and alcohol companies and the US government. We know now the government lied about the effects in order to suppress the medicinal effects of the plants so that they could themselves patent it. The lumber, paper, and cardboard industry also was involved in the cover up due to hemp being a better alternative.<br>
I fully understand that abusing the drug can have negative effects on cognitive function and mental health. But, occasional and even regular usage linked to <em>greater</em> neuroplasticity over time, not less. This is also dependent on the chemical makeup of the strain that is used. There are several hundred to thousands of terpenes and cannabinoids that work together to produce the psychoactive and therapeutic effects.<br>
The Endocannabinoid system is the Great Regulator of all the other biological systems in the human body. It <em>only</em> interacts with cannabinoids, which were part of the human diet for tens to hundreds of thousands of years. We developed this system as we co-evolved with the plant over thousands of generations and migrated with it. Anthropologists have been able to track movements of certain civilizations just by following landrace strains that grew over vast regions as we brought them along. It is <em>the</em> most widely used plant across all of human history. We crushed the seeds for cooking oil, we used hemp similar to grains and wheat, and we used the flowers for spices, for tinctures, teas, soups and broths. It became a cultural part of almost every major society in existence, and before 1900 it was in almost everything. Almost every major religion had it's usage implemented in religious ceremonies (yes even the Christians, before it was just Sage it was a mixture of cannabis+sage).<br>
You've been lied to by people who want you to think that alcohol and tobacco are a better alternative. If you want to keep an open mind, I'm happy to provide you with references to all of this work. They are mainstream studies by real research universities, not some hippie's blog. It's truly fascinating and it deeply saddens me that we lost this part of our culture. It's especially frustrating since my family lineage is from a place where our ancestors cooked with it for thousands of years. Many of my siblings, myself included, have found relief from a variety of autoimmune issues by using certain types of cannabis supplements. It's not just for stoner hippies to get high and listen to grateful dead albums, it has real cultural and medicinal value.</p>

        <p>If you read the response you'll see what I mean in context! I wrote a long response because the government did the same thing to cannabis as they did to ivermectin on covid. The stats you are saying about the effects are junk science and propaganda. That was my point, I'm sorry you've checked out!</p>

        <p>I smoke a lot. 29 years old . Have 1 degree going on 2, before covid I had 3 dance teaching positions, this year I started my own landscaping business. Your bother is lazy because he lacks motivation. You are simply a judgmental person. Weed definitely does have its drawbacks , but ppl can use it in moderation and get enjoyment out of it .</p>

<p>Take two people who are exactly the same in every way, have one smoke daily and one who doesn't, I'll put my money on the one who doesn't being far more successful 99% of the time.</p>

        <p>Not even . Consider all the professional athletes that smoke weed. They play against competition that does not and still win. Nate Diaz for instance off the top of my head , but I'm sure you can find a bunch. Weed can be used as a reward system like anything . When you finish your work for the day , you can reward yourself . But if you're smoking during the day, when you have things to do , I might agree that's Not a good habit to get into.</p>

        <p>It's a dopamine pipeline. The sjw shit opens them up to the possibility that their parents warnings were wrong (they weren't, they know better from experience), and once that is broken down, the dopamine train is fair game. They will start playing too many video games, start watching porn, get high, and.. what happened? You are effectively getting everything your brain desires on your own, with ZERO drive to relate to other human beings. "Wow, why am I so depressed all the time?"</p>
<p>Your parents warned you, you didn't listen. I didn't either, I'm not a saint, but was luckily able to stop that shit. I went to college, I have a wife, two kids, a good paying job with a bright future, a house and honestly, had I kept playing WoW and getting high like I did in high school, I likely would have ended up a loser with none of this if I didn't start working on improving myself. It's a slippery fucking slope, and anyone that calls it propoganda has not matured enough to even BEGIN to know what they are talking about.</p>
