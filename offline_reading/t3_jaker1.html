    <strong>Don’t blame the virus</strong>
    <p><p>I see people posting things like; ‘my business was destroyed by the pandemic.’, ‘I lost my job because of Covid.’ </p>
<p>No you didn’t, you lost your job because of the the government forcing you out of work. Your business was destroyed by the fear mongering media. </p>
<p>Covid is the new invisible enemy. No ones pointing the fingers where they should be pointed. They are just blindly accepting that it is something that is out of their control and unavoidable. They can’t be mad at the government because they are too busy being mad at a virus.</p></p>

        <p>I watched the DNC in its entirety, and it perplexed me to hear Dems repeatedly blaming Trump for the lockdowns and subsequent job loss, poverty, school closings, etc.</p>
<p>Trump was on TV practically begging states to reopen!  While governors like Newsom and Whitmore were locking down even tighter, effectively screwing the working class.  Are people really this ignorant?</p>

        <p>Absolutely not! The President cannot unilaterally override state law. I doubt Congress could even do that.</p>
<p>The United States is a collection of 50 co-sovereign states. Responsibility for policy regarding COVID-19 and their citizenry lands squarely on their shoulders, not Trump's. Some governors did a great job, others have been disasters.</p>
<p>I give Trump a lot of credit for not using this pandemic to dramatically increase the power of the federal government -- As I believe almost any other president would do -- and instead keeping the federal government limited to the powers it's supposed to have.</p>

<p>Including Biden.  I lose sleep over what will happen if he's elected.  He's already mentioned passing a federal mask mandate.  I fear that would only be the beginning.  Our comings and goings would be stringently controlled by the government, even after COVID is in the rear view.</p>

        <p>I learn so much on reddit, including nice folks like you, Backslashx90, that tell me about the US government and it's powers. I read history books but I am at a loss about some things, mostly the law. OK. Someone posted below you that Biden could create a national mask mandate. Now how does that correspond with the fact that states are sovereign and have been making their own mandates regarding masks? The federal government can withhold money from schools that "don't make the grade." Doesn't that mean that the government can withhold money from California for not allowing enough freedoms? Or does the federal educational funds have a different jurisdiction? Thank you Backslashx90 for any answer you can give me. I am really bored during this time and discussions like this excite me.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately I think you're correct. My original answer was talking mostly<br>
about a direct order to the states to either open or impose a mask mandate, but
side-stepping states' rights has become something of a hobby for congressmen in 
the past several decades and all while the courts, in my view, have been asleep <br>
at the wheel. </p>
<p>For example, it used to require a <em>constitutional amendment</em> to enact
prohibition, but now the Federal government just assumes it can pass a law to
outlaw drugs. Nothing fundamental was changed in the constitution to allow the
Feds to outlaw drugs since prohibition, they just silently usurped that power.</p>
<p>I think the most egregious example of federal expansion of power in modern
American history was the passage and subsequent upholding of the National 
Minimum Drinking Age Act (NMDAA) (upheld by South Dakota v Dole). Of course the
act couldn't just set the national minimum drinking age because that is a power
that is pretty clearly reserved for the states. So instead it blackmailed the
states into raising their own drinking ages, lest they lose 10% of their
highway funding.</p>
<p>Since then, like with prohibition, the federal government has usurped even more
power. Remember last year when they quietly raised the smoking age to 21 by
including it as an earmark in the 2020 budget!? So the federal government
doesn't even need to pass a specific law to change these things anymore! They
just quietly stick it in as an earmark to an omnibus package. </p>
<p>So to answer your question, Trump could probably try to strong-arm California 
into reopening by cutting funding to its unemployment program, saying that they are wasting federal dollars by staying unreasonably locked down for an unreasonable amount of time. But that likely
won't happen because it would require a law to be passed by The House and The
Senate, and the house is currently controlled by Democrats. Plus, even if it  <br>
did pass, it would likely immediately spark a lawsuit which would almost certainly go to 
the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals (which in infamously leftwing) and would         <br>
almost certainly get struck down. The Supreme Court could then take it up, but
probably wouldn't.</p>
<p>Likewise, and unfortunately for us, Biden could do the same thing for the mask
mandate.  He could make the case that states which don't follow the mandate are
wasting Federal healthcare dollars by not following the Science^TM and thus
should have their Medicare and Medicaid funding cut. There is hope that such a
mandate could be struck down by the courts after an inevitable lawsuit, but
would be unlikely. Either way, this is why it is important that the Supreme
Court Justices are oriented in the direction of individual rights and the
Constitution.</p>

        <p>Interesting. I never thought about how they outlawed drugs. I just thought it was a crime to poison yourself. But then there is possession laws as well....I have to read up on South Dakota vs. Dole. And earmark laws?? I did not know about this at all. Of course, smoking leads to many health problems, but it is a choice to smoke. Too many smoking laws right now as it is. Thanks for the interesting facts.</p>

        <p>I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. Here in Georgia most of the state has been open this whole time with minor restrictions. The city of Atlanta though has been under heavy restrictions. Cobb County Georgia is doing awesome right now. Let’s hear it for a Republican governor.</p>

        <p>The Dem logic goes like this: "Trump didn't take the virus seriously back in January...therefore it got out of control and we had to lockdown for months, thus destroying the economy." </p>
<p>Of course, not only is this total bullshit on every level, but it's also very telling how they would have treated this virus if Trump hadn't been the president...they would have done next to nothing...just like they did for H1N1. The plan would have gone something like "look, we effectively quarantined all the travelers returning from Asia and the virus never got a hold in the States". Maybe they would have counted a few dozen deaths of some elderly retirees that all contracted covid from their travels to East Asia. There would have never been this gleeful wanton destruction on every facet of society. It's clear that so much of their psychotic response is directly related to their political agenda.</p>

        <p>I feel like the moment the dems really latched on for death was when Trump announced his faith in hydroxychloroquine. The dems denounced that right away and because the panic buying was happening at the same time, they realized this could be trumps downfall if they kept playing the hysteria cards and blocked any avenue of cure or hope against the virus. I’d bet money they’ve even done things to drag the vaccine process out slower than necessary.</p>

        <p>Notice how they had an entirely different narrative back in February. Remember how the high priests of the Covidian religion themselves were saying "it's nothing to worry about, it's IFR is similar to annual flu". They told the truth in the beginning. Then they did a bizarre 180 and completely flipped the switch overnight in March, when they realized they could use this to destroy Trump. How can anyone not see right through this bullshit? It's so blatantly obvious. And the whole BLM crap in the summer made it even more obvious...yet their mindless followers are so gleefully doing mindless gymnastics to keep believing the lies.</p>

        <p>I am new to this sub so forgive me if this has been answered many times. I agree that the media has overblown the pandemic same as sharks attacks, tornados, devil worshipping and hundreds of others. My understanding was the shutdowns were to avoid overrunning hospitals. Was this never a possibility and should leaders have known it wasn’t possible with the information they had? Most agree that overrun hospitals would be bad and cause deaths to rise.  I live in a state with a Republican governor, Tennessee, and we didn’t really have much of a shutdown. Our governor did a decent job considering. The media is blamed for many things but at the end of the day they are just a business selling a product that people want. I stopped watching TV soon after pandemic began and encourage people not happy with the media to do the same. People that complain most about the media typically consume the most if it. It’s like saying you hate peanuts while constantly eating them by the handful.</p>

        <p>I was going to disagree with you about the DNC because that's not what I heard but I think it would fall on moot ears. I suspect this will be removed . I don't think that Democrats are blaming Trump for the lockdowns, I think they are blaming Trump for not getting ahead of this before it became a bigger issue. We can all say that this doesn't exist and it may be blown out of proportion but it does exist. Denying that it exists to me is more along the lines of ignorance. I know that I go against what many believe here and I would like a normal more than you can even imagine but we don't always get what we want. That's life and you do have a choice and I'm not here to change your opinion. I make my choice and I'm not telling you what to do but the Democrats are no more at fault than the Republicans.

        <p>Your comment is so convoluted and full of deflective bullcrap, I don’t even know where to start.</p>
<p>Nobody denies that “it exists,” you made that up in your own head.</p>
<p>I hope you don’t <em>really</em> think that Republican administrations have been as guilty as Democrats have in their destructive, tyrannical responses. I hope you don’t really think that, because it is so divorced from reality as to be a top-to-bottom indictment of your ability to think straight.</p>

        <p>I don’t think anyone in this sub is saying it doesn’t exist. Yes I agree that they are saying trump should have locked down sooner. But who doesn’t have great hindsight? That’s a worthless accusation . 
I’m pretty sure both sides were against lockdowns in January. </p>
<p>Even if we did lockdown then, that wouldn’t do anything different. Each time we open back up the virus is still there, like Jack Nicholson saying “heeeeres Johnny”</p>
<p>That would happen whether we locked down in January February March or any time. Because lockdowns are NOT the right answer. Period.</p>

        <p>This ubiquitous linguistic sleight-of-hand also (conveniently) serves to further the fraudulent narrative that all of the tyrannical responses were...a given. Like, there was never even a consideration of if we should or shouldn’t impose these measures, this is just how we respond to infectious diseases. Lockdowns and masks? Yup, totally normal, nothing to see here. There’s a pandemic! What did you expect!</p>
<p>The never ending, wall-to-wall drumbeat of</p>
<p><em>DUE TO THE VIRUS</em></p>
<p><em>DUE TO COVID</em></p>
<p><em>DUE TO THE PANDEMIC</em></p>
<p>might be the single most widespread fraud in the history of mass-media. It’s such an obvious, bald-faced lie, yet every single source does it in every single article. Often times, multiple times per article. The pages of newspapers are filled with dozens and dozens of this particular lie.</p>
<p>Is it that these writers are “getting it wrong?“ How can they all be in such lockstep on such an obscene, obvious falsehood? It is hard not to conclude that it is purposeful.</p>
<p>As long as we continue to perpetrate grandiose lies of this nature, the parties responsible for this (media and government) will never be held accountable. And the destruction and deterioration of our societies will continue. It will continue until we the people insist on a true reckoning, and true reckoning starts with...truth.</p>

They have been exposed to so much propaganda in almost perfectly abusive circumstances that even if you showed them Covid killed no-one and it was just a giant mistake, they would still insist on masks and hiding.

<p>Then cheer on the police when they arrested lockdown protestors in Jan/Feb and literally praise the police and support the police as they arrested citizens who were small business owners and family breadwinners terrified out of their minds that their livelihoods and families were going to be irreversibly financially ruined forever.   </p>

<p>So many useless blithering retards that just fucking eat whatever the media jams down their throats and up their ass and then they thank them for the social assrape. There is no thought, no logic, no independent analysis, no critical thinking, nothing beyond just being a worthless fleshbag ordering grubhug hamburgers bought off a virus relief check, shoving it down their throats while bitching at the working class and calling them "Karen's" for wanting lockdown to end so they can run their business that pays for the motherfucking stimulus check the retards bought the fucking burger with for no other reason than the media told them to.  </p>
<p>Holy shit this unironically enrages me to type and think about.</p>

        <p>The owner of a local thrift shop here in NYC had to close up from the lockdowns. She went on a huge emotional social media campaign saying Pres Trump alone ruined her 14 year business and begged her patrons to vote for Biden. I was sad to lose one of my favorite shops but her reaction made me want to stab my eyeballs out.</p>

        <p>YES THIS!</p>
<p>getting the blame at  the right monsters means, that proper thinking about whether they were justified can begin.</p>
<p>the monsters trying to blame their dystopian nightmare on an invisible enemy is of course no accident, but a long known strategy, that was WELL planned out, before all of this started.</p>
<p>the psychopathic monsters behind all this are many things, but they certainly aren't stupid and they are good strategists thinking VERY VERY longterm.</p>
<p>so yes, getting just this point across  somehow to people can shake things up in their programmed minds and they will see  the dystopian measures critical at least a little bit at the start and that can and hopefully will result in them researching a lot more.</p>

        <p>This is a circular logic train to nowheresville.</p>
<p>Step 1. Government creates crisis </p>
<p>Step 2. Government steps in to “help”</p>
<p>Step 3. Private businesses are now in debt to the entity which created the crisis in the first place </p>
<p>This tyranny is a means to seize power and further expand the state. Government actions have been an immense burden for businesses and citizens alike.</p>
<p>Government actions have been an immense boon for...government.</p>
<p>The ultimate problem with your logic is, what are “normal” circumstances? What is a “crisis”?</p>
<p>Governments have been manufacturing phony baloney “crises” for their own benefit since the dawn of civilization.</p>
<p>So I repeat: Employers (and really, anyone who doesn’t work for the government) needs government to <em>get the hell out of the way.</em></p>

        <p>This might shock you, but masks are the least of our problems. We just want our lives back.</p>
<p>At least in my opinion, I’ll tolerate a mask if it means I can do everything else. I’d prefer not to have one, but it’s more important to me that I have a job.</p>

        <p>There's no point in responding to CCP shills like that.  If you are in favor of anything other than eternal lockdowns and total destruction of Western civilization, they just recite the script about how you're "anti-science", you're a "COVID denier", you're a "right wing conspiracy theorist", etc.  The "person" you're responding to probably doesn't even speak English, they're just copy/pasting from a script.</p>
