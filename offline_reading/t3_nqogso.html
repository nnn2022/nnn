        <p>So he's saying the test is 90% correct, 50% of the time. Which really makes it 45% correct on average.</p>

        <p>The best way to explain it would be this:</p>
<p>You have a million people that get tested. Out of that 1 million, 1% are sick. That's 10.000 people.</p>
<p>If you test all of them with a 99% accurate test, you will have 10.000 true positives and 1% false positives, which amounts to another 10.000. So when taking the test and getting a positive result, you only have a 50/50 chance it's a true positive.</p>

        <p>There was an interesting article in Lancet about the number of false positives in Covid-tests. The estimate there is between 0.8%-4.0%.</p>
<p>The article: <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2213-2600%2820%2930453-7">https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2213-2600%2820%2930453-7</a></p>
<p>In practise if the share of positives from all tests is around 1%, you can be assured they are most likely almost all false positives.</p>

        <p>Let me try to elaborate. Assume our test is 99% correct in recognizing sick patient as positive case and 99% correct in recognizing healthy patient as negative cases.</p>
<p>Suppose now 100 000 peope are tested and 1000 (one percent) is indeed infected. There are now 99000 healthy tested and 99% will be true negative being 98010 cases and the remaining 990 are false positives.</p>
<p>Further, from the 1000 infected we get 990 true positives and 10 false negatives.</p>
<p>In total we have 990+990=1980 positive cases in population where we had prevalence of 1000. This means the proportion of false positives is 990/1980 \~50%. </p>
<p>We got here with a test that is 99% accurate in both directions. The problem is the low prevalence in the population that skews it a lot.</p>

        <p>Thank you so much for this! So would you say then the false positive rate for PCR tests is about 50%? I thought I read somewhere in a medical journal or news article saying that the PCR tests were producing as high as a 97% false positive rate, no?</p>

        <p>The rate of false positives depends of the prevalence. You can see this by considering the extremes. Following the assumptions in the example, if full population of 100 000 is infected, you will have 99 000 positive cases and in this extreme the infections would actually go underreported. On the other extreme, if there are no infections in the population, you would go with 1000 positive findings and 100% of them would be false.</p>
<p>With low prevalence the accuracy is bad. The bigger prevalence, the better tests works.</p>
<p>In Covid the problem is the lack of golden standard. For example in pregnancy tests it is easy to physically exam (=golden standard) the subject to verify the true status and the compare the pregnancy test outcome with the golden standard. With Covid we are in dark due the lack of golden standard. There is no way to "calibrate" or understand the sensitivity/accuracy of tests. Everything is guess work.</p>
<p>By these reasons reporting case numbers per day makes absolutely no sense. In my country they defined a magic number "cases per 100k people over two weeks" that defines how deep lockdown we have. This is silly because the more we test, the more cases per 100k we get in all circumstances.</p>

        <p>There's no "test for the disease".</p>
<p>The PCR test tries to identify if specific RNA sequences are present in the sample.</p>
<p>RNA sequences are not a disease.  Even if those RNA sequences are present, that doesn't prove that there's an active infection.</p>
<p>A "disease" is: processes that go on in the body.</p>
<p>In the vast majority of people that get infected with this virus, the immune system functions adequately consistent with how it's evolved to do over some 500,000,000 years.  There are no disease processes in these people.</p>
<p>In a small portion of the population that have an infection, their personal individual immune systems become dysregulated, and their bodies have disease processes going on in them.  The body of evidence indicates this is due to severe and/or multiple nutritional inadequacies.</p>
<p>Besides the nutrients that are known by science to be required by the immune system to function properly and which are known to often not be obtained in adequate amounts, science also knows of a number of other products of nature that our bodies have evolved to potentially derive beneficial use of to avoid disease processes going on in the body when challenged with a virus like this one.</p>
<p>The disease is not caused by the virus; it's caused by their failure to properly take care of their immune system, which they do because the so-called "healthcare sector" has programmed them to not care for themselves over many decades to suit their self-interests of ever expanding revenue/profit/ROI.</p>
<p>It's in the self-interests of the "healthcare sector" for people to have drug problem based thinking.</p>
<p>Sloppy/simpleminded mis-use of language over the past ~18 months (and last several decades, for that matter) has been a significant part of the bizarre and destructive response to this virus.</p>
<p>Please stop letting everybody get away with sloppy and/or simpleminded mis-use of language.</p>

        <p>Yes to all of this. Plus, as a stats guy I will add in:</p>
<p>• “COVID deaths” - we all know this one </p>
<p>• “fatality rate” - improper use and comparisons of CFR vs IFR and not explaining the difference to the public </p>
<p>• “pandemic” - no criteria has ever been agreed upon by the scientific community for declaring a pandemic, despite years of planning for this supposedly “predicted” event, therefore a “pandemic” is anything you want it to be, which means nothing at all</p>
