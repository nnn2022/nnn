    <strong>[VENT] Reddit should be held accountable in future Nuremberg Trials 2.0</strong>
    <p><p>I didn't know this until now, but whenever I've tried citing/linking information from either BitChute or Zerohedge, Reddit removes the links. I have to re-edit my posts to use alternative links from different websites. </p>
<p>Reddit is very cowardly, and definitely not a bastion of free speech! See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil, right? ðŸ™ˆðŸ™‰ðŸ™Š</p>
<p>I really despise Reddit, and I would consider them (along with FB and YT) to be complicit on what I would consider the greatest psyop since 9/11. <strong>Blood is on their hands.</strong>ðŸ˜¡</p></p>

        <p>I think the worst part about it is that when half of us who were on r/wuhan_flu early last year screaming that the pandemic is real and they need to shut down travel back in January and February from China and saying that the virus was leaked out of a lab they just quarantined the whole subreddit. </p>
<p>They censored us when something could have been done and then they continue to censor when it's clear that there is nothing left to be done. </p>
<p>Almost like they wanted it to spread.</p>

        <p>Oh wow, I had no idea the Reddit Admins did that. That's so rotten and scummy of them to censor a forum/subreddit. I'm slowly learning about how this could have been a bioweapon, which could have originated from Fort Detrick. </p>
<p>Fort Detrick houses a bio-research center, but there were accidents that led to the <a href="https://www.fredericknewspost.com/news/health/fort-detrick-lab-shut-down-after-failed-safety-inspection-all/article_767f3459-59c2-510f-9067-bb215db4396d.html"><strong>biolab being shut down</strong></a>. The CDC sent the base a letter in July, and they closed down in August 2019. It only recently re-opened back in March 2020. </p>
<p>But then there was a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2019/p1028-first-analysis-lung-injury-deaths.html#:~:text=As%20of%20October%2022%2C%202019,median%20age%20was%2045%20years."><strong>rash of deaths all attributed to vaping</strong></a> in October 2019. In all of the victim's lungs there was the <a href="https://altcensored.com/watch?v=Hc392CaUPLw"><strong>ground-glass opacities</strong></a>, which is also a common theme for <a href="https://www.health.com/condition/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/ground-glass-opacities-covid-19#:~:text=According%20to%20Isabel%20Oliva%20Cortopassi,are%20sick%2C%22%20says%20Dr."><strong>covid-19 patient's lungs</strong></a>. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2019/p1028-first-analysis-lung-injury-deaths.html#:~:text=As%20of%20October%2022%2C%202019,median%20age%20was%2045%20years."><strong>CDC report</strong></a> could not find a cause, but only said the only commonality was that all the victims vaped. </p>
<p>I don't have the source link anymore, but it is possible one or two soldiers from Fort Detrick went to Wuhan in <a href="https://www.teamusa.org/USA-Wrestling/Features/2019/October/18/CISM-World-Games-advance"><strong>late October 2019 for the World's Military Games</strong></a>. While it can be seen as China pushing a "conspiracy", <a href="https://whdh.com/news/as-the-who-investigated-coronavirus-origins-in-china-beijing-pushed-a-conspiracy-about-the-us/"><strong>they did ask the US for more information about their bioweapons research</strong></a>. Even non-Chinese blogs or independent journalists <a href="https://prospect.org/coronavirus/did-the-military-world-games-spread-covid-19/"><strong>started asking the same questions</strong></a>.</p>
<p>But at the same time, it's been found out that Fauci and some other scientists from a particular laboratory had connections to the Wuhan bio-research center, studying bats and coronaviruses. And the biolab in Fort Detrick was also doing studies on bats and coronaviruses. I know in the early days there were at least three different strains recorded; one in the US, one in China and one in Europe. </p>
<p>I don't know, too many theories, but one thing is for certain, and that is we're being lied to on an enormous scale. My trust in public officials is almost zilch. I fear the worst is to come. Let us pray and hope some truth and solutions can come about soon, as many people are suffering, and we need answers.</p>
