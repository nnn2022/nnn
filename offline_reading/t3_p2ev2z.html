    <strong>What was your immediate thoughts/ feelings when you heard the vaccine was becoming a reality? I think they announced it 2 weeks before it was released if I remember correctly.</strong>
    <p><p>I was scared and horrified. I didn't even know the details about it yet. The topic of medical rights and vaccines have been on my radar for quite some time. My first thought was "Is this going to be forced?"</p>
<p>It seemed like the rest of the world only cared about whether it would be FREE. I knew that it would be, not only FREE, but also incentivized because of what I seen with the flu shots.</p>
<p>Then people started getting it and info started coming out on it. We seen what happened to Tiffany Dover. I didn't know what to believe, because we didn't know at that time that the vaccines were, in fact, killing people. Then rogue doctors started speaking out, stories shared of family members and friends declining physically &amp; mentally and some dying. </p>
<p>I guess I could say I'm informed on the counterargument for vaccines in general. AKA "anti-vax". That's what stopped me initially from running out and getting it before finding out about all the nastiness.</p>
<p>I'm just curious how the people who aren't anti-vax knew to avoid this before the horror stories became available? Was it because it was rushed &amp; experimental?</p>
<p>Note: I can't remember where I heard this, but supposedly Fauci wanted the flu shot to be the big, universal shot everyone got. But the fear wasn't strong enough, and the flu shot isn't very effective. Not that the Covid one is effective, but they did have the fear element.</p></p>

        <p>Initially, I was hesitant. Actually hesitant, not the definition they are using now. But my first reaction was it was a week after the electiom. Just a coincidence I'm sure.</p>

        <p>As someone who was never really explicitly pro or anti vax but always believed in informed consent and have followed alternative media for a while now, I knew since last summer that once the vaccines came out they were going to eventually be coerced and forced on people en masse. I had a feeling that was what the whole “pandemic” was about from the start – getting people to get the vaccine. It’s classic problem, reaction, solution. Problem = “deadly” pandemic, must do something about it! Reaction = force people to stay in their homes. Shut down businesses. Force people to wear masks. Solution = cram experimental mRNA gene therapy down everyone’s throats in order to not lock down anymore and end the “pandemic”. Only to go back to normal, everyone must get it. The "pandemic" was the perfect opportunity to try to institute the technocrat's wet dream of social credit based on vaccine status. It's a major step to the government controlling what you put into your own body.</p>

        <p>I was hopeful it would work and be safe.</p>
<p>It seems to provide decent protection on the primary pathogen for a short period of time (4-6 months), provides little if any protection against variants, and has a side effects profile that makes the risk/benefit analysis pretty complicated for a lot of healthy people considering their low risk of hospitalization and death from Covid.</p>
<p>What I am horrified by is given all of these facts, that are provable and growing more evident daily even in the data provided by government sources, that employers and governments are mandating the vaccines.</p>

        <p>It was announced at my work in December, I was one of the first ones eligible to take it. The moment the full word “vaccine” was out of my bosses mouth, my whole body froze and my stomach felt like it dropped all the way to the basement. I am not against vaccines and that would not have been a typical reaction for me, but I had been following the progress of this “vaccine” since it had been announced they were working on it. Usually I would trust that it would be normal and fine and I wouldn’t read too much on it but my instincts were telling me to keep up because something is fishy. When they were announced at work, my instinct told me to gtfo immediately. Nothing about it feels right. Nothing about it sounds right either. I checked to make sure it’s not a purely emotional decision. And I continue to check evidence to be sure. But I gotta trust my gut as well because it usually knows something before I do.</p>

        <p>As soon as this pandemic started and 3 weeks to flatten the curve became 3 more I thought they are going to make our lives miserable forever, until they come up with a V and make it mandatory to get out of this mess. And we will all be so desperate we will do it. I went down the pharma rabbit hole a while ago... So it seemed to me mandatory jabs were always going to be part of it</p>
