        <p>&rt; the more you test the more cases you detect.</p>
<p>Yes, and the goal should be to detect all the cases. The actual number of cases is independent of the number of tests, but our understanding of the breadth of the problem is better when we test more.</p>
<p>So your original statement,</p>
<p>&rt; that the more people you test the more cases you get?</p>
<p>Is completely untrue because you aren't getting more cases by testing more. Those cases were already there. Stopping testing doesn't make those cases disappear, and it won't save anyone from dying.</p>
<p>It sounds like satire because it's exactly what the (soon to be ex-) moron-in-chief suggested months ago as a way to contain the virus - an obviously laughable suggestion, worthy of much derision.</p>

<p>I didn't say stop testing you dumbass, stop putting words into my mouth. My point was that the more you test the more cases you'd get daily, so it's no surprise that cases are rising by the day when we probably test a hundred times more people than we did back in may. But the media won't report that, all they can say is "CASES SUUUUURGEEEE!!!!!".</p>

        <p>Maybe "the majority" just get flu like symptoms, but also a very large minority die from it. About 10x as many people died of covid in America since March than died of the flu in the 2018-19 flu season. How can something be 10x as deadly but also "the same"?</p>

<p>Who gives a fuck about May? The US is seeing double the daily new cases than were being recorded in the first week of November. We're doing the same amount of testing we were two weeks ago, but the case count has doubled.</p>
<p>That's the surge.</p>
<p>&rt; My point was that the more you test the more cases you'd get daily</p>
<p>Ideally not. What you want to see is a stable case count even if you do more testing. That way, you know that you aren't underreporting cases. (Or, more accurately, your delta between reported cases and actual cases isn't growing. Unless we test everyone ever single day, we will be underreporting. It is obviously not feasible, practical, or necessary to test everyone every day.)</p>

        <p>But you do realize that daily deaths have stayed the same, while cases are going up, which means that more people aren't  getting the rona, but more people are being diagnosed with it. The only thing this surge in cases is proving is what a joke of a virus this is.</p>

        <p>I’m sure it’s hard for you  to understand what is going on you’re making up your own reality.</p>
<p>April isn’t May.</p>
<p>A day of 2,700 deaths isnt daily deaths of 3,000.</p>
<p>And Disneyland is still closed.</p>
<p>Literally none of this stuff is all that hard to fact check, so maybe, just maybe, you should recalibrate and try to keep up.</p>
<p>Cases go up, hospitalizations go up, deaths go up.</p>
<p>Sometimes those deaths take a few weeks to log locally, and that trickles up and can result I. Situations where death rates seem to be low but they are just lagging behind and other situations where death rates seem high but they are just from cases identified weeks ago.</p>

        <p>You're literally talking semantics now. The point isn't the exact number of cases, but the fact that case numbers don't mean shit, only death numbers do, proven by the fact that in April there were far fewer cases yet far more deaths. And don't give me that lagging behind shit, there weren't many nearly as many cases in April or March as there are nowadays, but yet there were far more deaths.</p>
<p>Cases going up does not mean hospitalizations go up, as is proven by the fact that the death rate back in April was way higher even though there were far fewer cases. The reason why cases are rising is because more people are getting tested, pretty simple really, I don't understand how you can't wrap your head around that one.</p>
<p>Disneyland, Disneyworld, same shit, again you're arguing semantics. Just admit that you have no argument.</p>

        <p>Semantics?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You are making up a false reality.</p>
<p>You say deaths have remained the same, yet they are on the rise in the US and globally.</p>
<p>The 7 day averages have nearly doubled, and the daily deaths continue to increase day after day.</p>
<p>There are lags, it’s not shit, it takes time to die, and it takes time to record those deaths that’s why if you arrange by date of death it ALWAYS looks like we’ve rounded a corner, but we haven’t as we can see deaths continue to climb.</p>
<p>Hospitalizations are up, hospitals across the US are under immense strain with no sign of things getting better. And again deaths are up too.</p>
<p>Tests alone do not explain what’s happening, they don’t account for the fact that cases are rising faster than testing.</p>
<p>Stop making things up, facts matter.</p>

        <p>Except it’s not meaningless. Thousands of people are dying every day and the deaths continue to increase.</p>
<p>And again deaths trail cases and that’s why we see deaths continue to climb as cases climb and deaths will remain high even as we pass a peak this winter.</p>

        <p>Fine, we should aspire to detect all the cases. </p>
<p>If we had a coherent response, we could avoid lockdowns <strong><em>and</em></strong> minimize deaths by knowing where the problem is and how widespread it is - by detecting all the cases. The countries who were able to do this (or get very close) fared very well economically &amp; healthwise.</p>
<p>So no, it's not impossible - the US just didn't want to do it. A certain segment of the general population and the political "leadership" decided that it was <strong><em>more important</em></strong> to avoid the mild inconvenience of temporarily wearing a piece of cloth on your face than it was to not completely disrupt the economy and kill hundreds of thousands of people.</p>
<p>Ultimately, my point that you have <strong><em>completely missed</em></strong> is that much of this pain and disruption in our lives could have been avoided with some actual leadership and <strong><em>minimal effort</em></strong> from average citizens.</p>
<p>Lastly, in case you couldn't tell - bolding and italicizing your comments doesn't make you right. Much like raising your voice or repeating yourself doesn't make you right. </p>
<p>Please try leaving this echo chamber. I see so many straw man arguments going on in here about what this sub thinks 'maskers' and 'doomers' want it would be laughable, if it weren't causing so much damage.</p>

        <p>I'm a contractor for the government, I work with disabled adults. One of the agencies I have to deal with sent out an email recommending us to get tested weekly, I went ahead and hit that "unsubscribe" button. What an insane suggestion. I haven't heard of a single provider even testing positive, and have only heard of one client who tested positive, yet they push this shit like it's critical. Fuck that.</p>

        <p>Isnt capitalism sort of inherently undemocratic? Like the more money you have, the more power you have, the more power you have the more likely it is you can circumvent democratically made laws and even pay to have laws made or removed. Given how unbalanced unfettered capitalism is, it seems extremely undemocratic.</p>

<p>Court ruled that the test is unreliable and the New York Times deemed it  only 10% accurate.  What now?  The tests do nothing but give false  positives.  Hospitals should be ashamed of themselves.</p>

        <p>You know that nobody believes people who say this without proof, right? So, why don't you show me some proof that covid doesn't show up in people weeks before they show symptoms? The other side has proof that it <em>does</em> show up prior to symptoms. Where is your proof? Give me the evidence that it doesn't show up before symptoms, and I will believe you. Or at least credibly dispute their proof, in that world at least you are both on the same level. But without that evidence on the back end, why should anyone believe you?</p>

        <p>Science is imperfect, we learn and adapt.</p>
<p>If this was a grand conspiracy then things would be much neater.</p>
<p>The big undertaking is the snake oil salesmen who promise a miracle cure or downplay the severity of the illness.</p>
<p>I’ve watched my wife battle this thing for months in her hospital. The long days, the unpaid OT, the patients in denial, the administration not allowing doctors to wear masks, the ever changing guidance as we learn about the disease.</p>
<p>The thing that gets me are the conspiracy theorists who jump from conspiracy to conspiracy always thinking the next set of false answers is going to be right when they’ve been proven wrong again and again.</p>
<p>It’s like housewives jumping from MLM to MLM, it does change.</p>
<p>It’s great to be aware, and to question, but damn, we have people saying this is a Chinese bio weapon made to destroy America and in the same breath refusing to wear a mask.</p>
<p>If it’s a weapon wouldn’t you want to stop it?</p>
<p>Big Etsy didn’t start the virus, but properly made masks worn properly will stop it.</p>

        <p>Pure idiocy. Cases are soaring all over. Death rates are up, and denying it because of some silly conspiratorial paranoia is a sign that half of America currently believes reality is whatever you prefer.  Even die-hard Republican governors are now instilling public health restrictions because they have to: Not doing so would cause the unnecessary death of tens of thousands. I don’t care if any one person has decided that science is a lie. I do care when they insist their ignorance should shape public health policy in the country. Remember when America was at the forefront of science and technology? Those were the days.</p>

        <p>Out of curiosity, is it only numbers in the US you believe are untrue?  Or do you see this as some kind of global conspiracy between literally every country in the world right now?</p>
<p>There is some interesting conversation here in this subreddit that would suggest that the numbers are inflated - but to dismiss it entirely seems a little ridiculous.</p>
<p>We get our public health results every day including testing numbers - so the argument that testing increases account for cases doesn’t hold water.</p>
<p>I’ve seen a lot of posts a death rate of 0.01% on this sub - don’t know where this comes from either.  Even if the numbers are inflated, the US has a 3% covid death rate - maybe 2-2.5% is more likely?  is it really that believable that nearly ALL covid deaths are umbrella diagnoses?</p>
<p>In Canada, we have a 4% death rate with much smaller sample sizes.  In BC we have been handling it fairly well (at first) with only 1-2 deaths a day or every couple days up to 10-11 per day this last week.  The numbers are too small to reasonably fabricate - but... they are growing.  </p>
<p>I think perhaps somewhere between the sky is falling and genuine concern would be a good place to land...</p>

        <p>I don't know about other countries, but the hospitals in the US are getting paid for every covid case/death. So they have been marking covid on alot of stuff that shouldn't be marked as covid. </p>
<p>Also, the CDC even came out and said only a fraction of their numbers were legitimate covid deaths.</p>

        <p>Or, hear me out, you can still have covid with no symptoms and if you do it’s not you people are worried about, it’s those who could die or develops serious medical conditions from covid. If you have covid, regardless of whether or not you have symptoms, you A. Still have covid and B. Are still a danger to other healthy or unhealthy individuals. NOT EVERYTHING IS ABOUT YOU!! Stop being selfish and take other people into account! Trust me when I tell you I’m really really tired of this pandemic but it’s happening, it’s real, and the sooner we accept that and do something about it the sooner it’ll be over.</p>

        <p>That’s the issue, it’s selfish for you to do whatever you want regardless of the risk to everyone and yourself just because you want to “live while you can”. Everyone needs to understand that the sooner we get this under control the sooner we can start living again. And you should care about case numbers and stop being in denial of them rising. Again I agree with you this sucks and I wish we could all be living like normal but we need to fight this virus as responsible human beings. The sooner this is over the sooner we can get back to normal, and this ends sooner by everyone following the restrictions.</p>

        <p>Well... <em>they</em> may have no symptoms, but that doesn’t mean that the people they pass it to won’t develop mild, severe, or fatal symptoms. It affects people differently... this isn’t that hard to understand. All you need to do is use common sense. Wear a mask for your own protection... wash your hands for your own protection... and it will have the nice “side benefit” of protecting others as well.</p>

        <p>No.  The PCR test amplifies genetic material.  Fauci and other scientists have said that if you amplify the sample more than a certain amount, a cycle threshold of around 33, you are essentially looking at dead genetic material that is not a virulent AKA not capable of causing an infection nor of being spread.  It's left over genetic remnants from when you may have had the virus (months and months ago)or something genetically similar to Corona but not corona.  But it gets counted as a positive case and the person is told to isolate.  Doing what they ask you to do as precautionary 'just in case/side benefit' measure is besides the point.  They are lying to us, or at least not disseminating the truth enough to avoid the hysteria around CASES CASES CASES.  And when I say 'they' I guess I mean the media but where the fuck are the medical experts that should be reinforcing this point every time they give us their grim assessments?  It's either they're totally incompetent, falling in line with everyone else to preserve their career and reputation (like politicians), they don't trust the public enough to not treat them like children, or they're flat out lying for reasons I can't understand.</p>

        <p>I think what I like most about this fiasco is that employers are forced to keep sick people away from the public. Before COVID, BC, they’d make you come to work sneezing, coughing, aching, killing grandmas. Grocery stores were notorious for this.</p>

        <p>I’m delusional? hahahaha right. You just said it is killing people and yes it totally is worth shutting down the economy over. These are Americans you’re talking g about. You’re defending money that isn’t even yours while 240,000 Americans have already died and we’re going into a season that is going to absolutely decimate the elderly. But hey, those are the people that keep voting for conservatives so maybe there is a silver lining after all. Thanks for making me glass half full about it. </p>

        <p>The NBA stopped getting those unreliable tests.  That test being used to diagnose covid only has a 10% accuracy rating according to the NYT and was ruled unreliable by the Portugal court system.  Stop getting that damn test because all it does is give false positives.</p>
<p>Covid has the exact same symptoms as influenza so even if the person is sick, it's not possible to know he has covid.  </p>
<p>Want accuracy?  Run the test at 25 cycles.  Labs are running it at 45 or more!</p>

        <p>Live in Missouri. Yes people are dying every day and now there’s a new virus that can be controlled by people easily not going out in social gatherings and by wearing masks when they do go out and yet here we are. Paid time off in the form of a bailout for the little guy for once would be nice. Nah, let’s keep sending literally billions of dollars in the form of corporate welfare repeatedly to help out billionaires that can’t even spend the money they have in one lifetime. Yeah that’s a great idea. One $1200 check 5 months ago should be good enough right?!?!  There. Get it now?</p>

        <p>What an insanely stupid remark you just made. I don’t take my kids to social settings but do I require my 4 year old to wear a mask if she’s around people? Yes, because she’s 4 and even at 4 she understands that it’s important because I explained it was important to her once. You people have to have it explained to you repeatedly and you’re still like “idk, Hannity doesn’t like em so I don’t either” about it. You don’t even understand basic high school science which is why the left is pushing for canceling student loan debt. So more people can go to college and not end up being a complete dumb fuck like you.</p>

        <p>What do you mean debunked? Asymptomatic virus carriers isn't a new thing. It's been a recognized part of virology for a while. 
The other thing is that the incubation period for Covid is longer than it is for the flu, and you're most contagious (for any virus) during the incubation period. That's why the flu spreads so fast every season. Because you're most contagious for the first two days after infection, before you're immune system ramps up and you start presenting symptoms. Incubation for Covid is 4 - 10 days. Many who are asymptomatic, just aren't symptomatic <em>yet</em>.</p>

        <p>No. The PCR test amplifies genetic material. Fauci and other scientists have said that if you amplify the sample more than a certain amount, a cycle threshold of around 33, you are essentially looking at dead genetic material that is not a virulent AKA not capable of causing an infection nor of being spread. It's left over genetic remnants from when you may have had the virus (months and months ago)or something genetically similar to Corona but not corona. But it gets counted as a positive case and the person is told to isolate.</p>

<p>Court ruled that the test is unreliable and the New York Times deemed it only 10% accurate.  What now?  The tests do nothing but give false positives.  Hospitals should be ashamed of themselves.</p>

        <p>Hate to inform everyone but we are having people with 'no symptoms' drop dead from this virus on a daily basis while going around their regular business.</p>
<p>That is what makes CoVid-19 so frightening: You can be going around your business per usual or just sitting in your home and 15 minutes later? You are dead.</p>
<p>No symptoms does not mean that the virus is not doing damage to your body. No symptoms very well could mean your body does not recognize the CoVid-19 as a threat to your health and life.</p>

You’ve flattened the curve.
You’ve freed up hospital and ICU beds. 
You’ve stopped transmission with yourself. 
You’ve died painlessly and cheaply.
