    <strong>Welp, it's starting again...</strong>
    <p><p>I already made a post recently about my general loneliness and how this whole pandemic is affecting me and today I got even more reasons to be upset.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Besides the daycare like place for adults I visit (and were everyone has completely bought into the media, to the point that the people there rant every.fricking.day about the "stupid people that don't follow the corona rules to a t" and how they would like to "walk up to these rule breaking people and publicly chew them out") I also get some assistence at home.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Basically I have a person who visits me every week to help with different problems and chores (making contracts, managing letters, helping with chores, all that stuff). This person is part of an organization that offers help for people with problems and/or disabilities and they also offer different activies each month that you can participate in.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Little summer festivals, trips to major cities, walks through parks, a little cooking group... all that stuff. Obviously when covid came they had to put all these activities completely on hold for several months, but starting a month or so ago they were finally allowed to have those activities again. They still couldn't do trips to other cities or big meet-ups, but at least it was something.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Well, I applied for an activity that was supposed to happen tomorrow... and I got a phone call today that thanks to the rising infections all those activities are postponed again until january at the least. And to top it all off there is also serious talk at my daycare facility about what to expect when they have to close again for a while (which might just happen soon).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Joy...</p></p>

        <p>"<em>Oh, you're going to complain about your</em> <strong><em>minor inconvenience</em></strong> <em>while EVERYONE ELSE DIES?</em>" <strong>/S</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, take every thing like this and then add it up. Day after day, month after month. There's nothing 'minor' about it.</p>
<p>Our lives have been taken away, and we are criticized for complaining about it - and in many places (including &amp; especially Reddit) censored for asking about it. Express slight skepticism in a comment on /r/worldnews, for example, and find yourself instantly banned forever, without warning.</p>
<p>That kind of system wide censorship is not normal, and it's proof that we're up against something much bigger than what it claims to be on the surface. To really understand it, look into "The Great Reset" and then take all the bubbly utopian propaganda and imagine how it might be done in a way that is destructive to our daily lives, while empowering those who are doing this to us.  I say "doing this to us" because we have no say in it.</p>
<p>Sometimes we're called 'conspiracy theorists' even when it's right out there in the open. Look at this: <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/shopping-i-can-t-really-remember-what-that-is/">https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/shopping-i-can-t-really-remember-what-that-is/</a></p>

<p>Hang in there, we might be in for a long ride. <em>But you are not alone.</em> We'll have to fight this, and it won't be easy... but as time goes on more and more will wake up. Much of the social distancing and mask stuff is to make us feel isolated and alone, even though there may very well be a quiet majority of people who agree with us.</p>
