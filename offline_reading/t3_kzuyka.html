    <p><p>And if you bring up this fact, they will tell you with full confidence that their views have nothing to do with the media hammering it into their heads 24 hours a day, but instead will claim their views come from being empathetic and caring about people LOL.</p></p>

        <p>Years ago I worked as a server at the Olive Garden. People would ask for multiple baskets of breadsticks, load up on unlimited salad, and order oversized calzones, only to finish their order by asking for a Diet Coke. I’d walk away shaking my head.</p>

        <p>Artificial sweetners cause an insulin spike, so your blood sugar drops in anticipation of getting some sugar. When you don't get the sugar the, now lowered, blood sugar makes you hungry. Diet drinks make you consume more calories indirectly.</p>

        <p>As someone who went from obese to overweight by losing 65lbs, I feel you're both correct.</p>
<p>H0ss1 is correct in that self-discipline is a huge part of dieting.  </p>
<p>TheOneFreeMan420 is also correct, in the sense that drops in blood sugar feel <em>very</em> different to an obese person than they do to someone who is merely overweight.  When I was obese, the feeling of blood sugar crash was torture.  I described the feeling as "hunger panic".  You don't just feel stomach-hungry; you feel like you're getting hot and cold flashes, you may feel faint, you may feel like your anxiety levels are spiking.  Now, as someone who was never diabetic or even pre-diabetic while obese, I consider myself lucky because I could ride those awful feelings out and eventually my blood sugar went back to normal on its own without eating anything.  But it would be a torturous 30-60min until it did.  Once I got down to the "overweight" category, my blood sugar was done with that weird rollercoaster, thankfully.  I have never forgotten how much harder it felt to not overeat while obese than it did while overweight.  The difference was like day and night.</p>

        <p>I grew up during the AIDS epidemic where we were told if we had sex with the wrong person it was a certain death, a very unpleasant long and painful death usually. Even safe sex had risks, condoms broke etc.</p>
<p>We still fucked.</p>
<p>Today, millennials who are at peak health stay home too afraid to leave over a cold virus with over a 99.9% survival rate (for healthy young people)</p>

        <p>During the peak of the AIDS epidemic, there was a sub-culture of gay men who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugchasing">actively tried to catch HIV</a> as some form of Munchausen syndrome.</p>
<p>I feel that the people who are the most vocal about keeping everything shut down and never going back to the old normal (and don't have anything financial or political to gain from doing so) are doing it for similar reasons. They like the sympathy and attention that they wouldn't be getting otherwise because in the old normal these people are unremarkable. And that is why they are on social media every day posting about how they are heroes for wearing a mask and not going out.</p>

        <p>That’s exactly it. Before COVID, people who sat home all day gaming and eating McDonald’s were called lazy wastes of space. Now they’re being worshipped like heroes in the lamestream media. They don’t want to go back to a world where productivity is valued and they’re expected to actually work instead of crying to big daddy government for some free money because of the scary cold they might catch if they ever go outside.</p>

        <p>I remember being literally petrified of aids, because of news media.  There was no internet.  Checked out books from the public library as they became available.  One was a collection of case studies, including a married couple in which one partner unknowingly had it, likely for years.  The other partner was tested, and after six months (how long you had to wait for results), the other partner tested <em>negative</em>.  This was not the point of the study so no attention was called to this detail - it was almost buried - might've even been a footnote.  But there it was in black and white - in stark contrast to the absolute panic being perpetuated by MSM.  Hell, that might've been the actual day I became a skeptic.</p>

        <p>The media is owned by oil execs, banks, financial execs, and ceos of companies like coca cola and Verizon. These people PAY MONEY to Influence what is shown on which channel, and which time and at which effect. Males aged 18-34 etc etc, they take these statistics and fine tune a very tunnel visioned view of the world and the news to influence public opinion and thought. This is fact. </p>
<p>A society that lives in fear is easier to control. You can control how they think, what they eat, who they have sex with... add in a mystery floating fear (a scary invisible virus, a scary terrorist from far away with different colored skin, overexaggerated  and lying about the effects of ailments to ensure control. You'd be surprised how much fear works to control the average person that "just wants to live a decent, unbothered life".</p>

        <p>not to mention, it is mid January with a virus that has been well known for going on ten months now. We all know it kills those who are obese, have diabetes, and are old. Two of those things can be changed or mitigated. How many who are terrified of the virus, those who are still quarantining and wearing masks all the time-how many are still as fat as the day they learned the virus is good at killing fat people ten months ago? If they haven't lost a single pound, they are a walking, breathing contradiction of their own set of facts. If they know as a matter of fact that they are in a category that is threatened, in my mind it would follow to do your best to remove yourself from that category if possible. God it hurts my brain so much when I think about these things, it really does because the answer is so on its face obvious but no one wants to admit it.</p>

        <p>The obesity rate in the US is something like 42%. It no shock that those people will not take responsibility for their own health. Even suggesting diet and lifestyle change is considering 'fat shaming'. Its pathetic that it has gotten to this point.</p>

        <p>that is indeed sad, because that is the next logical contingency if this vaccine doesn't really work, it would be trying to increase the health of the entire population as a means for everyone to have the best chances of getting an eventual infection. people need to warm up to that idea because that's what's coming.</p>

        <p>They pretend to care about everyone else's health but it's really so they can pass off responsibility for their own health onto everyone else but make it look justified. To be fair, some people are overweight for reasons that are genetic or to do with an illness, but for the majority this is not the case, and they should want to bolster their health and immune system rather than hide behind a mask. And lockdown makes it worse since it's harder to go out and exercise.</p>

        <p>You think people actually look up anything about this virus? No. They listen to the media which portrays nothing but death and destruction. You think the media is telling them it has a 99% survival rate? No. It just tells them 400k have died from it so far and it's coming for you and your grandma and it's SURGING. Most people I ask grossly overestimate how deadly this virus is.</p>

        <p>&rt; They listen to the media which portrays nothing but death and destruction. </p>
<p>This alone ought to be a massive red flag to most people that something isn't right. If the coronavirus pandemic were truly as devastating as the media claims, their first decision would have been to calm people down and highlight the positive outcomes of the "fight" against the pandemic; how many people have recovered, success and survival stories, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Instead, the media tries, at every conceivable effort, to paint this virus as the most deadly thing even contracted and spread by man. Two-thirds of Europe died during the Black Plague, and even they didn't exemplify as much utter nonsensical panic as the mainstream media is over a virus that, for most people, is indistinguishable from the common cold. Whoever genuinely gives into their panic either did so on purpose to begin with, or is lying to themselves because of the media's insistence that only "bad people" would deny the virus's deadliness.</p>
<p>&rt; Then there are people who are worried about long term health effects of covid. These are the same people who will take their chances sleeping with strangers during covid because sexual urges. It's all smoke and mirrors. </p>
<p>And then they have the nerve to act like WE'RE in denial, and THEY'RE the scientists in this situation. Why does a Redditor, who indulges himself with fast foods, antisocial behavior and an infinite assembly line of internet pornography, suddenly feel like an authority on health and biology, to the point where they're willing to ruin other people's lives just to see their fake utopian health-nut paradise come to fruition?</p>
<p>If you're going to preach to the choir about how important our health and safety is, at least do a half-decent job at PRETENDING to be healthy.</p>

        <p>so then why wouldn't they tell people who are at risk (diabetes and obesity) to lose weight and exercise? wouldn't that lower the death toll in addition to masks and social distancing? why is that never talked about?</p>

        <p>diabetes can be managed with proper diet and exercise. doctors have even taken patients off diabetes medications with lifestyle changes. obesity is literally as simple as eating less food. that food in front of your plate? yes, literally all you have to do is eat less of it, it's that simple. and given you're eating less food, it means you don't have to buy as much food which means you're saving money. and yes, age unfortunately cannot be changed but the other two can-things we have complete and total power over.  </p>
<p>we have known for a long time that it kills those who are obese and have diabetes. answer my question-why have we not talked about simply living healthier to get people out of those dangerous categories?</p>

Everyday I see homeless junkies pushing shopping carts while wearing a mask. In fact one day I got yelled at by one for not wearing a mask. All I can do is laugh to keep from crying.</p>

        <p>When they tell you they're empathetic, you tell them to look up how many children die because of extreme poverty every day. If you'll point them to UNICEF's website, they'll find the number to be ~22,000, and when their jaws hit the floor, ask them how their "we need lockdowns", "economy is less important" and all the nonsense they keep regurgitating helps. That should put at least some of them in their places.</p>

        <p>Smoking alone kills nearly half a million people in the US annually. Globally, that's 8 million people annually. That's <em>every</em> fucking year. Multiply that by average lifetime and smoking alone easily kills 100 <em>times</em> more people than COVID, which is a one-off event.</p>
<p>Figures on "lifestyle diseases" are much worse. Of course, nobody cares.</p>
<p>The reason why they are afraid of COVID and not others is because it disproportionally affects old people who own and control this planet. They don't care about children and millennials.</p>

        <p>We really should bring back fat shaming. The fact that we aren’t allowed to tell people that they’re not healthy because of their weight is a disservice. Objectively, fat isn’t healthy. People don’t need to be coddled. They need to be told to lose weight.</p>

        <p>I disagree, I think if you want to balloon up to 600 pounds and keel over when you’re 30 that’s your right, and that’s what makes America great. Just stop acting like there’s any shared responsibility here. </p>
<p>Health in this fashion NEVER used to be viewed as irresponsible, a guy that doesn’t wash his hands was hardly more than a personality quirk 12 months ago (not saying this is me btw). Just because you can trace the path of an infection, that doesn’t mean you should, and that all of those people have blood on their hands. We used to talk about who got who sick in the office/at school like it was the weather, it’s just something we all surrender happened in a collaborative society, i can’t imagine how many diseases used to be spread at concerts and and sports events, the only thing that changed was the reporting</p>

        <p>I definitely think it’s ok if you choose to do that because, as you said, it’s everyone’s right to live their life how they choose. However, it should never be taught that being obese or overweight is healthy. It sets this horrible precedent that we have now where children (and many adults) believe it’s ok to be 300+ pounds and anyone who tells them otherwise is a bigot.</p>

        <p>I agree, I disagree entirely with health at every size initiatives because they’re simply lies, but I do genuinely believe that if you WANT to be fat then that’s your right, and in a system with relatively individualized healthcare (9 trill asterisks on this) that there’s not much of a moral issue with it</p>
<p>There is no question that consuming more calories than you burn is unhealthy, and will statistically give you a higher chance of an insane number of health issues, that information is objective, published, and frequently empirically backed up. What people DO with that information is up to them. Now if you chose to both hear and ignore that information, and then blame healthy people for not altering their behavior which either enables them to provide for themselves/their family or betters their mental health, THATS where problems arise.</p>

        <p>In the 80s and 90s-00s being skinny was seen as peak beauty. Kate Moss, Tyra Banks, all these skinny twiggy models were the ideal body type. Things came along with that like anorexia (pushing the desire to be skinny too far). Around the mid 2000s there was a shift to fat acceptance, bigger asses being sexualized and as such fat was "in" and has kept us on this unhealthy path since.</p>

        <p>I had a similar covidiot at work (a completely non-essential gift shop). She refused to sign the receipt because the virus might be on the paper, but as soon as she left the store, she lit up a cigarette.

        <p>I love this post. Healthy people under 60 have almost no chance at suffering major consequences from covid. In fact, it's difficult to even deliberately give very healthy, young people coronaviruses and influenza. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?journal=Am.+J.+Med.+Sci.&amp;title=Investigation+on+volunteers+infected+with+the+influenza+virus&amp;author=A.+A.+Smorodintseff&amp;author=M.+D.+Tushinsky&amp;author=A.+I.+Drobyshevskaya&amp;author=A.+A.+Korovin&amp;author=A.+I.+Osetroff&amp;volume=194&amp;publication_year=1937&amp;pages=159-170&amp;doi=10.1097/00000441-193708000-00002&amp;">In 1937, 72 people were deliberately infected with influenza</a> and only 20% of them developed any sickness (mostly mild).</p>
<p>It is everyone's personal responsibility to take care of their own health. We do live in a world were an overwhelming amount of cheap, easy to get, easy to eat, palatable foods exist that give us instant gratification. Eating these foods in excess is the problem, coupled with lack of exercise, stress from life, addiction to technology leads to the most unhealthy humans of all time, particularly in the USA where all of these issues are magnified.</p>
<p>Get lean, get strong, go outside, and take care of your own health. Always take care of your health first.</p>

        <p>This is similar to the idea that the government needs to mandate environmental programs and regulations to stop climate change. Some of the people most for this also drive giant SUVs and have enormous homes and use so much electricity and eat meat (factory farms cause huge amounts of environmental toxins and green house gas release). They won't personally make changes for the environment, but expect everyone to by government mandate...</p>

        <p>Instead of mandating to the commoners they should invest their personal money in clean technology. Toward making it affordable for the average person. Most people will choose what is environmentally friendly over what isn't if the price is somewhat close to similar. I personally can't afford to buy an electric car, raising the price of gas and oil will not make me able to afford one, it will just make me more poor</p>

        <p>It actually is contagious though.</p>
<p>Allowing the population to hit the point where 4/10 people are obese has normalized it so people are naturally more comfortable becoming overweight themselves. The rate is still growing steadily, we will most like hit 50% by 2030 if the trend continues.</p>
<p>It's a fucking travesty. These people will obsess over cigarettes, covid, guns, or gang violence and not once step back and look at the giant fucking beached whale sitting in the middle of the room.</p>

        <p>And yet look what’s seen as “heroic”: Laying around in pajamas while “working.” Ordering as much takeout and “non-essentials” as possible that someone else brings you while you “stay safe.” Not taking care of yourself, even not going for a basic haircut anymore to keep your hair looking healthy. And also, jamming up drive thru lines at fast food places so much that they’re pouring on to the street. Totally healthy. /s </p>

        <p>Here is my proposal for the future:</p>
<p><strong>Medicare For All...men and women under 25%/30% body fat.</strong></p>
<p>Kill 2 birds with one stone, shut the democratic socialists up because they get their god damn government healthcare, and force everyone to be healthy if they want it.</p>
<p>Everyone else can go pay for private insurance to support their awful lifestyle choices.</p>

<p>My diabetic countrymen (Mexico) are suddenly shocked that five sodas a day make you more prone to getting sick. </p>
<p>The fact that this virus is a joke for those that are healthy should make the strategy to follow very simple: do anything you can to improve your health, or else YOU can stay locked in your house for years.</p>

        <p>I saw an obese man at the grocery store in one of those ventilators for painting houses buying exclusively frozen dinners and beers in the adjacent check out aisle.  He pointed at me and snitched to his cashier about me not wearing a mask, the teenage cashier just shrugged his shoulders.  I'm in rural California and no one gives a shit.</p>

        <p>No I’m just scared of the long term effects that happen to approximately 1/3 of people. Some athletes’ really promising careers have been completely ruined. Many, many professional and sub professional players that got COVID have really bad long term effects. Some previously athletic people now can’t walk to the bathroom without being out of breath.</p>
<p>Do what you like, but when you can’t go up a flight of stairs, remember how everyone else must have felt if you didn’t even give them a choice. </p>
<p>Downvote me all you like, this sub’s a facebook echo chamber anyway, but please don’t hurt others with this disease. Give us the choice to react how we want and we’ll let you have it your way as well. </p>
<p>Even if it’s all “government propaganda” or some such, I’m playing it safe. This is my entire life I’m talking about, for the convenience of what, a couple
months? Do what you like, but I plan on being able to run past the age of 20.</p>

        <p>Hate to break it to you, but you've been mislead with disinformation. Every viral disease in the world, including the flu, common cold, and gastroenteritis, can result in "long term effects". Whether that be postviral lactase deficiency, chronic fatigue syndrome, myocarditis, pericarditis, scarring, or whatever.</p>
<p>None of those were dealbreakers then. We accept those complications as potential risks for every single viral infection (including other coronaviruses). Now those same complications are suddenly unnacceptable for COVID19?</p>
<p>You don't have to believe every media scare tactic that is making covid look like it's some super magical alien virus that has it's own rules. This is a respiratory virus, a mild coronavirus... hardly anything enigmatic.</p>

        <p>Yes, because the risks are SUBSTANTIALLY greater. One out of three people. Out of you and your parents, ONE of you won’t be able to run again in your life. You’re seriously ok with that??</p>
<p>There’s PROOF of COVID patient’s lungs looking much, MUCH worse than even long time tobacco smokers. Would you really want to risk that for a few months of talking to friends or going to work? </p>
<p>And what’s worse, if you don’t give a flying fuck about it, but your parents DO, you can still transmit it to them. Tens of thousands of people have already inadvertently killed family members such as grandparents, kids, pets, AND normal, average, perfectly healthy adults.</p>
<p>Why can you not just wait ONE FUCKING YEAR? None of us <em>want</em> to die. Do you not see that? Literally if we would have listened for ONE FUCKING MONTH, it would have been over very very long ago and honestly the general public probably wouldn’t even know anything about it. Do you guys seriously try to deny stuff like this? What possible other reason could be behind that. Fauci has been working on this stuff his entire life. You have been on facebook for half an hour. Get certified at as high a level as Fauci’s, present your proof, and I will believe you. Until then, you have no say, and should listen to what the professionals say.</p>
<p>If you were having a house built and the contractor said there HAS to be a pillar HERE, or bad stuff will happen. You say no, fuck the pillar, it looks better without and nothing’s ever collapsed before so it’ll be fine. Boom, it collapses and you come crying and screaming to your contractor saying he destroyed your house. This is what’s happening, except your pets, friends, and family are inside that house, waiting for it to collapse on them. Some may survive, or miss debris, or be dug out later, but <em>wouldn’t this have been a lot easier if you’d just listened to the person that knows what he’s doing?</em></p>

        <p>&rt;Yes, because the risks are SUBSTANTIALLY greater. One out of three people. Out of you and your parents, ONE of you won’t be able to run again in your life. You’re seriously ok with that?? </p>
<p>No, it's not 1/3 from everyone who got infected..I don't know where you get that info from since the vast majority infected from covid are asymptomatic (no symptoms) or have mild symptoms. It's more likely aprox 1/3 of people who actually got hospitilazed and had severe cases (mostly nonagenarians and octogenarians with multiple comorbidities). Only the most frail who don't have much longer to live get severe cases (those with pre-existing and serious end-stage conditions), barring the very few outliers where there's an infinitesimal chance that a healthy young person might develop a cytokine storm and die. That's exactly how the common flu works every year, in fact the flu has a higher chance of killing healthy young people and children than covid. It's honestly sad younger people like you are now being irrationally, illogically afraid of dying from this virus themselves even though it's been known since January what the nature of this virus really is (check CDC stats on death rate from certain age groups, children are literally 5 times more likely to die from the flu than covid). </p>
<p>&rt;Literally if we would have listened for ONE FUCKING MONTH, it would have been over very very long ago and honestly the general public probably wouldn’t even know anything about it. </p>
<p>I'm sorry, but you are extremely naive. You simply cannot contain low IFR virus. It spreads too fast...and you can do nothing to stop a highly transmissible but relatively mild virus. That is just how mild respiratory viruses are...too contagious and too high a number of asymptomatics to stop, contain, or slow in any significant way. It's just as absurd as trying to control any other respiratory virus. No masks or lockdowns or social distancing or other is going stop them. This is why these measures have all completely failed. </p>
<p>By the time you even notice the virus is there, it's already far too late to do anything to stop it even if you could...because by that time the virus has already taken hold and will at that point keep spreading until herd immunity is reached. Infact not a single respiratory virus has ever been eradicated and even Fauci confirmed we will never eradicate covid.</p>

        <p>No. We were told of the virus well before it became an issue for us. We also DIDN’T listen to mask mandates, nor social distancing, so you can’t say they didn’t work. Ok, if it’s literally impossible to stop or slow whatsoever, how the FUCK did New Zealand reopen so fast? Or other countries? Is that cause we didn’t pray enough?</p>
<p>Maybe, but we were told BEFORE IT WAS HERE. So, by your logic it wouldn’t have been too late and we WOULD have been able to stop it if everyone listened. You just disproved and invalidated your argument.</p>

        <p>That’s my point. You’re side has the ability to play the sympathy card and make it seem immoral to not care about a virus, when the risk is relatively low. </p>

<p>It's closer to 2% mortality rate.  And regardless of the mortality rate, we are in track to hit half a million dead in the US within a 12 month period, which is plenty high enough for us to take major action.

<p>Not everyone in this life will be saved.</p>
<p>Besides that, your chance of dying is directly related to your health and lifestyle, which is a PERSONAL responsibility</p>
<p>By your logic, nobody should drive a car because your chances of getting into a car accident go up 100% once you put it in drive.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, how many suicides have been related to lockdowns? How many businesses have been shut down? How many people's livelihoods have been crushed?</p>

<p>Most "pre-existing conditions" age, cancer history, asthma, diabetes, have little or nothing to do with PERSONAL responsibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even "personal choices" don't take away the value of someone's life.  Doctors fight just as hard to save the life of someone suffering from a drug overdose as a heart attach.  And we spend just as much time and resources to treat and cure lung cancer (which affects smokers almost exclusively) as any other form of cancer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Full lockdowns are cheaper and cause less injury to the economy than just letting the pandemic rage.  Our problem is that we never really did 
 a full nationwide lockdown.  Instead, we did partial lockdowns with poor adherence which did slow the virus, but never enough to let us properly re-open.  So in the long run, our strategy was much more expensive and much less effective stronger pandemic measures.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>But even our partial lockdowns save more lives and more businesses than doing nothing.</p>

        <p>Point 1.. disagree , all medical conditions are personal responsibilities. It is a choice to minimize them before they occur, most people don’t. Even conditions one is born with is ones responsibility. </p>
<p>Point 2.. we agree here but this is irrelevant.</p>
<p>Point 3.. bullshit. How can you believe this still? Look at Florida, no or minimal lockdowns, one of the least contaminated as well. Cali and New York, most lock downs, most contaminated as well.</p>

        <p>I used to work with a woman who survived lymphoma but took absolutely no care of herself. She was severely obese, I'm talking she had to lower her computer chair to the shortest height and she had to haul herself into that chair with a lot of effort to just sit down. She always had giant Starbucks drinks every single day, and ate nothing but fast food and junk food. She also was a total government mooch; she lied about what she paid for in rent to get government assistance and refused to work a full time job. Both of her kids are severely obese as well.</p>
<p>I'm sorry but someone like that is not my fucking responsibility if they can't fucking bother to take care of their bodies on the simplest level. Another girl I know who is super pro mask is heavily obese due to terrible dietary choices. Again, <em>that is not my fucking problem</em>.</p>

        <p>Not sub-human, the perspective is super human. You aren’t supposed to make policy from a government perspective as a human. You are supposed to make those decisions as an executor, concerned with the freedoms and rights of a huge number of people, not individuals. 
If you are too zoomed in to make these decisions you should not make them.</p>

        <p>Well actually just the opposite is going on here.  Most of the people who advocate that we do nothing and let the pandemic rage unchecked (including the OP) justify this because of individual rights and how it will impact them personally.  They usually argue that we should not be making any individual sacrifices for the common good, and that it is wrong for individual people who have a low chance of personally dying from the disease to be mildly inconvenienced by safety measures that will save lives and money overall.</p>
<p>So the big picture "zoomed out" perspective which saves the most lives and minimized the negative impact on the economy as a whole is what you have to go with, which in this case is the stronger lockdown measures.</p>
<p>Then the other role of GOV is to also minimize the negative impact of the pandemic safety measures as well.</p>
<p>We see the same in medicine.  When a life saving treatment or medicine has nasty side effects, the doctors also take on the responsibility of doing what they can to manage the side effects as well.</p>

        <p>Not only is that merely your opinion of what constitutes the larger perspective (which I argue is wrong) but all that is irrelevant since our government doesn't have the power to trample our rights for these reasons. The larger precedent already in place is that every person is to be free from this sort of intrusion. Every person, not each person. </p>
<p>It is also your opinion that the lockdowns work and there is strong evidence they do nothing (California) but again it makes no difference - The justification is not that this is personal or impacts us personally (each of us) but impacts the mobility and freedom of the society (all of us)</p>
<p>In your example, I would stay home if I were sick. Not tell everyone else what to do.</p>

        <p>You seem to be directly contradicting yourself.  You said that my issue was that I was too “zoomed in” and not seeing the larger perspective.  But you continue to be the one who argues that individual rights supersede the wider public good.</p>
<p>In reality, one of the most important and legitimate functions of the government is to consider how the actions that individuals have on the wider population.</p>
<p>For example, public health and safety codes are a recognition that one person or group of people may through their actions or in actions have the ability cause some public harm who’s impact would be great enough for it to be in our collective best interest to prevent.</p>
<p>For example, a restaurant owner’s “freedom” to run an unsanitary kitchen is outweighed by the negative public health impact.</p>
<p>And that is the larger perspective here.</p>
<p>And the data about whether or not pandemic safety measures cost less money to the economy in the long run and How effective they are in general is not controversial amongst public policy and public health experts and institutions.</p>
<p>So your appraisal of the situation in California for example doesn’t take into account the fact that there are radically different levels of enforcement of pandemic safety measures across different counties over which people are really allowed to travel.</p>
<p>But in general, both your and my ability to independently assess the situation will never achieve that of actual subject matter expert’s, amongst whom there is in agreement that lockdowns save money and lives in a long term, and the main problem with the US is that we haven’t been doing a very good job of locking down, so it’s costing us more money and more lives than it should.</p>

        <p>Your definition of 'public good' is not germane to the point I made to which you are ostensibly responding so you're off topic now.
I was, in my first comment, speaking from a position of principle - not policy. You're still talking about policy, you need to zoom out even further.  You're starting from too far down the rabbit hole where I'm referring to the more generic rule of law.</p>
<p>Our form of Government was established to stop men from defrauding or murdering one another, that was all. You are much too interested in what it can do for you. That is pre-enlightenment thinking.</p>
<p>You keep hearing me backwards because you think that I want special rights carved out for the individual. I don't want special rights carved out for anyone. Everyone should be left alone unless they are directly harming someone else or infringing upon that person's rights. (by the original definition of these rights, not the emanations and penumbra that I expect you imagine when I say this)</p>
<p>These lockdowns are illegal and an abuse of the emergency powers act. </p>
<p>I'm not trying to quarrel with you and you are ill suited to argue with me. I'm just posting for karma now :P</p>

        <p>I understand the internal logic of your position. You are not the first person I have encountered who does not believe in the concept of "public good", or at least that the GOV either does not have authority (or potential even the ability) to operate in the best interest of the public beyond simple things like contract enforcement and preventing imminent acts of violence and coercion between individuals.</p>
<p>And you state as much, and that this purpose is the sole and original "reason" for the formation of the GOV.</p>
<p>This is of course as factually inaccurate as it is irrelevant.  Factually speaking, there are a whole host of legitimate functions baked into the original formation of GOV beyond what you state here.</p>
<p>We could likely go back and forth on that particular point forever, but it is purely irrelevant.</p>
<p>Because when we have complete control over a thing, like the government, the most important question is "What is the most constructive way to use it?" not, "What was it originally intended for?".</p>
<p>That second question has importance in certain circumstances, like the interpretation of sacred or religious texts.  This is of course because of the baked in notion that the author's intentions themselves somehow define concept like "right" "wrong".</p>
<p>This type of belief is of course religious in nature, although this does not stop certain people from inappropriately applying it to secular texts like the US Sonstitution and worshiping them as though they were a sort of Bible.</p>
<p>The only other real context in which interpretation of the intention of the founding fathers, and more specifically the Constitution itself, might matter is in determining the application of constitutional law (not a trivial matter)</p>
<p>However, even this fails to address the separate but in many ways even more important concept of what the laws, constitution, and role of government SHOULD be.</p>
<p>However, I think that sometimes fear of such a formless and expansive discussion ("If the government could be anything, what would we want it to be?", or "What does an ideal government look like?") drives people too much more narrowly define the conversation in a way that seems much simpler/objective to answers ("What was the original purpose of government?", or "What were the intentions of the founding fathers?", or "is this particular thing legal/constitutional?".</p>
<p>Even then, from the strict position of constitutional law, case law, and federal law, the pandemic lockdows are 100% constitutional and legal.</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/IF8MswEQS7w</p>
<p>So legally speaking.  Can the government enforce laws which have some small potentially negative impact on a small number of people, which at the same time has a much more significantly positive impact on a much broader number of people?  At least sometimes the answer is yes.</p>
<p>SHOULD they though? At least sometimes the answer is yes.</p>
<p>You may want to live in a world where the guy who is piss ass drunk driving 95 mph in front of a preschool hasn't broken a law until he runs over somebody's kid, or where the only thing preventing snake oil salesman from selling sugar pills to cancer patients is fear of negative reviews online or maybe a lawsuit.</p>
<p>But I don't want to live in that world. And I don't have to.  Because we live in a society with a representative Government.  As long as people like me keep having input, the government is going keep weighing and balancing the rights and the good of the individual, with the public good.</p>

        <p>It’s around 1.7% for the CFR. IFR, which is the number that accurately describes how many people are actually dying, is much lower. It’s still not known exactly what it is, but by the CDCs own estimate, its 0.003% for people 0-19 years old, 0.02% 20-49, 0.5% 50-69, and 5.4% 70+. </p>

<p>Public health and safety codes, if done right, are good, and are not by definition illegal.</p>

        <p>I don’t think those people don’t have value I’m just having a hard time understanding why we’re doing all of this with Covid and why we didn’t with any other respiratory illness that those people were also at risk dying for? Is it cause they weren’t dying as much with those diseases? Why is it that with this we tell everyone else it’s THEIR fault people are dying but when people caught other contagious diseases in the past and passed away no one blamed anyone even though the person who died caught it from someone somewhere on this earth. It’s the idea that we all of a sudden have all of this blood on our hands when in reality we either always did or everyone realized that death happens and it’s no ones fault. It’s mentally exhausting and impossible to be responsible for other peoples health because we’ve never had to before with anything else that was ever contagious. You’re asking for human nature to be completely reset and for people to just worry about every single person who is at risk for death. That’s simply not realistic.</p>
