    <strong>Shower thought: The Vaccine Shedding Story is a Psy Op to Further Divide Us and Make Anti-Maskers Wear a Mask</strong>
    <p><p>The whole point of hoaxes like the Fauxdemic is to divide us and then rule over us. The pandemic is a narrative created to bring in unfathomable change to our society through implementing new surveillance laws, stealing money from the treasury and possibly culling the population. </p>
<p>The vaccine shedding story to me seems like a beautifully concocted Psy Op for people like us. It will make us alienate ourselves further from our friends and families by acting in the exact same way a “Woke Masked Karen” deals with same people who don’t muzzle themselves. </p>
<p>This story may even make us wear masks because we now think the other half are infected.  Again, the Psy op makes us behave like the very people we mock. </p>
<p>I feel like it’s a trap, let’s not fall for it unless we have hard good evidence from personal experience. Yes I have felt that shedding may be real, but let’s be actual scientists and not hysterical patsy’s like the NewNormal creatures.</p></p>

        <p>Totally agree.</p>
<p>For a few moments today, before I came to a conclusion similar to yours, my first reactions were:</p>
<p>1.Should I wear a mask to protect myself from whatever they’re shedding? (I never wear a mask for “covid”.)</p>
<p>2.I should stay away from friends who’ve gotten it. </p>
<p>Then, I was like waaait. Fool me once..</p>

        <p>I will not live in fear. I will continue to socialize with friends family and strangers. I am not going to lower myself to the level of those other people who are afraid and walking around in fear. When I die I die. Whether the shedding is real or not frankly I don't really care.</p>

        <p>You should care. Some people are having extreme side effects that go away once they stop visiting people who have had the gene therapies.</p>
<p>I mean gene therapy spike protein shedding is not unknown nor new. They have seen it for the past 20+ years in lab animals and it has caused problems with control group animals if they were kept in the same room with the gene therapied animals.</p>

        <p>These people have used simulations to figure out ways of trying to deal with people that refuse to get it. Just search for "SPARS" and you'll find one such scenario. There are also scientific literature out there that deals with this. One of the best indicators of whether or not people would go along with these measures was based on the perceived threat of their own health. COVID itself wasn't enough of a threat to coerce people because everyone knows the survival rates are laughable, this is another attempt to create a threat but it's equally as laughable, so it's secondary function is that this is just more information to further radicalize the herd, it's intentionally ridiculous because it is. </p>
<p>It's just more ad-hominem ammunition to dismiss your arguments along the vein of "oh I bet you believe the Earth is flat too". They don't want the herd risking having an actual good faith argument with us because they know we'll win because we have science to support our claims which is why they need to prop up the idea that we're insane and as ridiculous as possible so that they do not even attempt to communicate with us, which is why you'll automatically be banned from a number of subs by simply even posting here. They're scared of free and open debate.</p>
<p>mRNA has to be stored in lipid nanoparticles in order to even survive long enough to reach the cells, hence the extreme storage methods. Outside of the body? Not happening. Even if it were true, all you'd be exposed to are someone else's spike proteins which your body doesn't produce, without an adjuvant, and there is no live virus.</p>

        <p>You do you. I’m female and never had kids and want to keep my fertility. I’m not gonna freak out and completely avoid people wear masks everywhere etc. At this point I’ve cut a lot of people out of my life and I’m much happier without their drama. Most of my circle is MAGA and no vax anyway. I’m not telling other people what to do what their lives, my thing is I don’t want them forcing their views on me. I’m gonna do what I did when Covid first came out and that is be prepared, research, take REASONABLE precautions and see what happens and then re-evaluate the situation and adopt reasonable behavior and practices according to the threat level. I’m not comfortable dismissing this as a ps-op. I’m not ready to freak out and become a hermit either. I’m cautious and researching the possibility.</p>

        <p>I think it's a little more nuanced. They're propagating "vaccine shedding" to imply that people think it's literally the vaccine that's spewing from their bodies and getting into those around them. What's actually happing is the gene therapy is tricking your normal cells into producing a spike protein that's supposedly also part of the Rona. The spike protein abomination flows through your body triggering an immune response and making you sick with symptoms that mimic the actual virus. The problem is that there's no way to target which cells end up producing the spike protein. It could be any cell that has contact with blood including the lungs which is where "vaccine shedding" comes in.</p>
<p>In some people, cells in the lungs will end up producing spike proteins which can then be expelled from the lungs by the normal means. They'll float around on droplets like normal pathogens where they can be sucked up by unsuspecting bystanders and potentially triggering an immune response in their bodies. But, since it's only the spike protein and not the mRna component, your own body won't end up producing its own version of the spike protein. </p>
<p>So although it's not literally "vaccine shedding", it's still kind of gross and I'm glad that no one around me is interested in getting one.</p>

        <p>Exactly. It’s not technically shedding in the classical sense but it’s still problematic.</p>
<p>Too many unvaccinated women post menopausal bleeding from the vagina for this to simply be a psyop. There is definitely a physical component.</p>

        <p>I meant that ideally I wouldn't want morons in my units, but that assumes conditions from decades ago.  I only had limited results convincing potential test subjects to challenge the pro-vax narrative. Yes, it's meant to further divide, no, we aren't scared to recognize such.</p>

        <p>Agreed, makes us fear the vaccinated individuals. I can't say for sure, but I think the whole "they'll release another virus that will kill off the unvaccinated" theory is a psyop too to get more skeptical people vaccinated.</p>

        <p>Yes, I was suspecting this as well. The whole point of our side is to stop being afraid of interacting with other human beings and acting irrational. Let’s not stoop to their level. I’m not cutting anyone out of my life for being vaxed. The same way nobody vaxed should be cutting out people for not getting it. Be better</p>

        <p>I like your thoughts and I agree with the conclusion that we should follow science and not be hysterical; I'd add we should respect individual health decisions and community decisions.</p>
<p>If you follow "terrain theory" as a different explanation from "germ theory" (and I like to see different sides of things to get a fuller picture) then you may find research along these lines: both old and novel coronas and the manufactured proteins from the experimental jabs are little more than contagious toxin shedding orders.</p>
<p>In such a scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Herd immunity" is not necessarily achievable or desirable because a cold/flu is actually part of the body's own natural functions of toxin clearing, which is little more than temporary highly nuanced instructions for the body to commence with a dump of toxin-infested mucus, hence our inability to isolate a whole set of the instructions under Koch's postulates.</li>
<li>Even a bioengineered version of the "virus" (or garbled instructions to the body) would not make the body permanently ill except under cases of acidosis and/or people carrying too many toxins in their mucus and sudden dumping into lungs, veins, etc.</li>
<li>People who eat healthfully and filter their lymphatic system <strong><em>regularly</em></strong> will be flushing toxins regularly and they will not get sick from coronas and/or only have mild symptoms because whatever the body is doing is essentially hitting "flush" over and over on the body's sewage system and at some point the purified body recognizes when it's not necessary and the instructions will be ignored.</li>
<li>People with a lot of toxic build up, such as those living in New York City, will have their sewage systems overwhelmed by a cold/flu or other corona because it's the body dumping too much into the lymphatic system too quickly, leading to toxic shock.</li>
<li>The best preventative for injury from any sort of corona (or any other contagious trigger that we mistake for a virus) is cleaning our environment and managing what we put in our superlocal biome (our body).</li>
</ul>
<p>This might explain why this <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19802-w">article in Nature</a> (scientific journal published November of last year) demonstrates they were not able to compel one body to "infect" another among 10 million test subjects. Because under terrain theory, the symptoms are not caused by a virus or cell ejectamenta but a complex group immunity reaction designed to flush toxins from a local population. I'd guess that Terrain Theory would suppose why these particular instructions are leading to specific issues has to do with the proteins.</p>
<p>This is one reason I elect not to wear masks; I want a healthy immune system and I want to protect the immune systems of others. And I can only do that when I am constantly flushing toxins out and telling bodies around me to do so, just as our bodies and communities are designed to.</p>
<p>With COVID-19, the "spleen and lung" entry and aggressive blocking of the circulatory system could be because that's the "directions" (or the "map") given for the flushing to occur.</p>
<p>With the jabs, the spike proteins could be giving very peculiar directions, indeed!</p>
<p>However, it's only another perspective, there are no clear answers and there is just not enough real research being publicized at the moment for either POV. </p>
<p>I agree with u/mushysurfdog that we need more time to see what's really going on here, and presently it's wise to hold both possibilities in our minds. Yes, we have a lot of experience with "divide and conquer" but no, we do not have a lot of experience with the true long term costs of the various injected experiments.</p>

        <p>It's very possibly one, OP. A psy-op within the original one. Psy-opception, if you will.</p>
<p>But then again, where I am and how things are going here, ME wanting to avoid vaxxed people isn't going to be an issue: What's way more likely around these parts is people demanding our state dictator and his goons "deal with" people like us like Emperor Andy can in NY. You know, because we're dirty, dangerous, diseased, granny-murdering vermin who are keeping you from getting "back to normal."</p>

<p>Vaccine shedding has always been a thing. Even the left-wing "it totally doesn't happen" has to admit "it happens sometimes". And since the left loves their trickle-truths, it probably happens a lot more than "sometimes". Even the ongoing mRNA studies (that won't be finished for years) act as if it does.</p>

        <p>We are already divided.  And it may not be the worst thing to be divided. I dont want people with opposing views harassing me. It doesn't mean I hate them or I am rude to them.  But I honestly don't trust some people with opposing views and I dont want their views and immorality influencing me.</p>

        <p>I had this shower thought as well. Telling people to avoid friends and family because of a contagious agent. Sound familiar??? </p>
<p>I don't know a lot about vaccines so I'm not saying it's a hoax. I just know that 1) I will never get this vaccine, and 2) No one will ever convince to stay away from people I love and society at large. No.</p>

        <p>Idk, I haven't been sick since 1999 and I got sick two weeks ago after hanging out with my vaccinated friend. He's the only vaccinated person I've spent time around. I had similar symptoms that others have had.
Hanging out again Friday so we'll see if I get sick again.</p>

        <p>But maybe this is a psyop because people were catching on about the vaccine shedding 🤔 </p>
<p>I’m kidding, I think you’re spot on. If the vaccine was easily spreadable through shedding, there wouldn’t be such a push to get everyone vaccinated. They could seriously just vaccinate one person and let the rest play out…. Almost like covid!</p>

        <p>Yeah, I don't think anybody has actually died from this phodemic, I don't know anyone personally that has died from this thing, so it's probably not real.</p>
<p>I think everyone that has "supposedly" died, are actually hiding in my basement, ready to surprise me any moment now for my birthday party...</p>

        <p>Most of us do however know someone who died from the miracle injection. Happened to one very near and dear to me (F-22) on Monday.
It's insane to think that we might have to cope with losing most our relatives/friends in the next two years' time.</p>

        <p>Yeah they have already done this at least once that I know of. The Russiagate and Qanon psy-ops while seemingly coming from opposing sides both evoked similar responses from their adherents. To sit and wait patiently while some savior figure or group "saves" them from their perceived political enemies. They were also both used to discredit independent media and justify censorship.</p>
