    <strong>New Normal in Germany, Part 17/x: The conspiracy theory that turned out to be true - and even worse than expected. Hospitals are hiding intensive care bed capacities in order to receive more money, government decides more rules and measures because of a lack of capacities.</strong>
    <p><p>Review: A few weeks ago, there was some talk on Twitter that most people took not serious, just because it sounded absurd. When i first read about it, i also rolled with my eyes. Basically it was about the fact that all of a sudden ICU bed capacities that should have existed more than a year ago suddenly disappeared from the ICU bed capacity register. (This register is called DIVI-Intensivregister, therefore the Hashtag was #Divigate, if you want to read old tweets about it).</p>
<p>Quite surprisingly, a newspaper then published an article about the DIVI and made it clear that the matter would be correct and that the hospitals had actually reduced their capacities on paper by around 3000 ICU beds. Since the newspaper, at least in part, can be assigned to the more conservative spectrum, there was of course a shit storm. Self-appointed fact-checkers from other newspapers and  television stations "dismantled" the allegations and threw out charges of lies. The most asked question from the "fact-checkers" was: Why should the hospitals do that? So it was labeled as a conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>Present: After that there was almost 4 weeks of silence on the subject. Today the research network of NDR (Norddeutscher Rundfunk), WDR (Westdeutscher Rundfunk) and SZ (SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung) reported a message that should actually lead to the resignation of a large number of people, which of course will not happen. This research network must be taken serious, because in the past it reported, among other things, on foreign business of the Chinese leadership, on the whistleblower Edward Snowden, the Salafist scene in Germany, the emissions scandal, the so-called Panama Papers and so on.</p>
<p>So what was their report about? It basically said, that already on 11th January, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI, similar to the CDC/NHS) reported to the Health Minister, that the Hospitals are reporting less capacities then they have in reality. The reason for this behaviour? Money. If a hospital has less then 25% free ICU beds, then they get more money. So OF COURSE the hospitals suddenly had less free ICU beds. According to the RKI, the data reported to the DIVI central register are "therefore no longer suitable for an assessment of the situation,".</p>
<p>This means: The number of free ICU beds actually have been higher than reported. The utilization of the intensive care units was (and is), in addition to the incidence values, a magnetic criterion of the federal government for how strict or loose the corona measures are taken. The government tells, at any situation "We must not allow the health system to be overloaded.". This is of course a statement that is completely correct. Nobody wants to have an overloaded health system, nobody. But if you don't know, what the real capacities are, you can not implement any rules or measures or Lockdowns. But the government did it, is doing it and will do it in the future.</p>
