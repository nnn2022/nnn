    <strong>We've been doing this almost a year and my grandpa's nursing home cant figure shit out.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm in Michigan. My grandpa was put into a nursing home in July. Last week I was told 3 people came down with covid, today its 17 people. How can I trust healthcare when they allow this shit to happen in elderly homes? Healthcare workers do not care about you.</p></p>

        <p>It's the flu and it happens every year all over the world.  But they can't call it the flu because they need numbers for Covid.</p>
<p>Nothing cures respiratory diseases.  Nothing.   We've been living with the flu for over a hundred years.  Why would it not be present this year?   There's no reason to expect the flu to be gone.  Masks?  Show me one single article written before 2020 that says masks can stop the flu.  Lockdowns?  Billions of people still have to work as "essential workers" or we all die.   People need to stop pretending and just tough out the flu like we have been for the last 100+ years.</p>

        <p>Tell me about it...</p>
<p>Aside from maybe a doctor or two, I feel like most have been treating me like shit during a time I've been trying to look into medical issues I am having. I called my specialist today, after calling her on Friday. No return phone calls yet. It's just disgraceful and frustrating. </p>
<p>For the record, most of the medical professionals I've seen are Covidphobics too, the types who have to hose down a pen after I used it.</p>
