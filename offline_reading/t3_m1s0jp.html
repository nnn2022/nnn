    <strong>From now on whenever a pro-masker asks me for proof of anything I'm gonna ask for proof that they're honest and competent</strong>
    <p><p>They don't accept evidence when you give it to them anyways. I want the peer-reviewed studies that say that they're honest, that they don't have brain damage, that they're not indoctrinated, that they're not insane, that reality conforms to what they see, that they're not just a Boltzmann brain floating through space. I'm not taking it the least bit seriously anymore. I'm just gonna mess with them until they short-circuit and start running around aimlessly yelling about science or something lol</p></p>

<p><strong>Really think about that date.</strong>    </p>
<hr>
<p>&rt; From FDA.gov:
&rt; From February through the middle of May, the FDA issued a total of 59 EUAs for IVDs for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 based on validation data using contrived specimens derived from SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. As the pandemic progressed and more patient specimens became available, on May 11, 2020, <strong>the FDA recommended in the Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests that developers obtain and use patient specimens to validate their tests.</strong> So just from Feb-May 59 tests were authorized (so how many since then?) and the FDE recommended testing against real samples.  </p>
<p><strong>I can’t believe they would actually allow test developers to obtain and use patient specimens to validate their tests without isolating, purifying and examining under an electron microscope. UNREAL.</strong>  </p>

<hr>
<p>&rt; “I think if a country said, “You know, we need to end this epidemic,” They could quietly send around a memo saying: “We shouldn’t be having the cutoff at 37. If we put it at 32, the number of positive tests drops dramatically. If it’s still not enough, well, you know, 30 or 28 or something like that. So, you can control the sensitivity.”  </p>
<p>&rt; <a href="https://uncoverdc.com/2020/04/07/was-the-covid-19-test-meant-to-detect-a-virus/">Yes, you read that right. Labs can manipulate how many “cases’ of Covid-19 their country has. Is this how the Chinese made their case load vanish all of a sudden?</a>  </p>
<hr>
<p>&rt;Jessica C. Watson from Bristol University confirms this. In her paper “Interpreting a COVID-19 test result”, published recently in The British Medical Journal, she writes that there is a “lack of such a clear-cut ‘gold-standard’ for COVID-19 testing.”  </p>
<p>&rt;But instead of classifying the tests as unsuitable for SARS-CoV-2 detection and COVID-19 diagnosis, or instead of pointing out that only a virus, proven through isolation and purification, can be a solid gold standard, Watson claims in all seriousness that, “pragmatically” COVID-19 diagnosis itself, remarkably including PCR testing itself, “may be the best available ‘gold standard’.” But this is not scientifically sound.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&rt;Hence, we have asked the science teams of the relevant papers which are referred to in the context of SARS-CoV-2 for proof whether the electron-microscopic shots depicted in their in vitro experiments show purified viruses.  </p>
<p>&rt;But not a single team could answer that question with “yes” — and NB., nobody said purification was not a necessary step. We only got answers like <a href="https://bpa-pathology.com/covid19-pcr-tests-are-scientifically-meaningless/">“No, we did not obtain an electron micrograph showing the degree of purification”</a>   </p>
<hr>
<p>&rt;Countless labs have reported a 100 percent positivity rate, which means every single person tested was positive. Other labs had very high positivity rates. FOX 35 News found that testing sites like one local Centra Care reported that 83 people were tested and all tested positive. Then, NCF Diagnostics in Alachua reported 88 percent of tests were positive.  </p>
<p>&rt;How could that be? FOX 35 News investigated these astronomical numbers, contacting every local location mentioned in the report.  </p>
<p>&rt;The report showed that Orlando Health had a 98 percent positivity rate. However, when FOX 35 News contacted the hospital, they confirmed errors in the report. <a href="https://www.fox35orlando.com/news/fox-35-investigates-florida-department-of-health-says-some-labs-have-not-reported-negative-covid-19-results">Orlando Health's positivity rate is only <strong>9.4 percent, not 98 percent</strong> as in the report.</a>   </p>

<p>&rt;Development of new vaccine technology has been plagued with problems in the past. The current RNA based SARS- CoV-2 vaccines were approved in the US using an emergency order without extensive long term safety testing. In this paper the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine was evaluated for the potential to induce prion-based disease in vaccine recipients. The RNA sequence of the vaccine as well as the spike protein target interaction were analyzed for the potential to convert intracellular RNA binding proteins TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43) and Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) into their pathologic prion conformations. The results indicate that the vaccine RNA has specific sequences that may induce TDP-43 and FUS to fold into their pathologic prion confirmations. In the current analysis a total of sixteen UG tandem repeats (ΨGΨG) were identified and additional UG (ΨG) rich sequences were identified. Two GGΨA sequences were found. Potential G Quadruplex sequences are possibly present but a more sophisticated computer program is needed to verify these. Furthermore, the spike protein, created by the translation of the vaccine RNA, binds angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a zinc containing enzyme. This interaction has the potential to increase intracellular zinc. Zinc ions have been shown to cause the transformation of TDP-43 to its pathologic prion configuration. The folding of TDP-43 and FUS into their pathologic prion confirmations is known to cause ALS, front temporal lobar degeneration, Alzheimer’s disease and other neurological degenerative diseases. The enclosed finding as well as additional potential risks leads the author to believe that regulatory approval of the RNA based vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 was premature and that the vaccine may cause much more harm than benefit.  </p>
