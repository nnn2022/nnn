        <p>Itâ€™s not as much about converting people as it giving the people already wrestling with doubt, permission to set it all down.</p>
<p>And the answer Is pretty easy: go out without a mask. As often as possible.</p>

<li>Their opinions most likely come from emotion-based propaganda and fear as opposed to intellectual thought and reason... so you won't be able to convince them with facts, or by pointing out fallacies in their reasoning.</li>
<li>The harder you push, the more they'll push back. You can accidentally cause them to dig deeper in their beliefs if you try too hard.</li>
<li>Rapport is critical. In person communication is better, but since you mention online -- try to do it in chat rather than in "public" on Facebook. People are keenly aware that other people see what they are saying so your good points will make them look bad, further upsetting them.</li>
<li>A little bit here and there is better than a lot all at once. Don't approach things as absolute - the more absolute you are, the more absolute they will be in their defiance. Instead, say "maybe this" and "maybe that." Instead of "you are wrong" say "I wonder if."</li>
<li>A far as "sounding like a nut" goes -- this is a trap set up by the other side. If you oppose masks, you are a nut. If you think Covid is less dangerous than the plague, you are a nut. This "nut" thing and the term "conspiracy theorist" comes from scapegoat propaganda. It is a technique that dehumanizes one point of view so that it can be discarded and ignored. The tool here goes back to rapport. The more likely a person feels similar to you, the more they identify with and like you --- the less likely they are to "other you" which is what scapegoat propaganda is about.</li>
</ol>
<p>What you are considering will be very difficult and more than likely it will reveal a dark side of your friends. The person you thought was reasonable may suddenly lash out at you, attack you, threaten you, insult you.</p>
<p>If any of that happens try not to hold it against them; they have been brainwashed and manipulated into this state.</p>
<p>Instead, take it as a message that you came on too strong and change your approach next time.</p>
<p>Remember, in communication -- it is the responsibility of the communicator to get the message across. Taking responsibility, like that, is the only way you have control over the communication. If it becomes the other person's "fault" for not getting it -- then you'll never succeed because you can't change other people.</p>
<p>Most importantly, you have to keep your cool and pull back as soon as things become elevated. Remember, also, that none of them will agree with you on the spot unless they already agree with you.</p>
<p>If your goal is to change opinion -- think of it like planting a seed that grows later on, and if you put too much water on it's going to drown it.</p>
<p>If you can plant a seed of doubt in the minds of your friends, it may grow. Remember, truth shines bright if you let it... But we are fighting against propaganda and censorship in this war against us.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

        <p>They have to figure it out on their own. Unfortunately, that is difficult to do with a group of people who believe everything that is fed to them and questioning any of it labels you as "crazy" (although in a sea of labels, idk why anyone gives a shit anymore). I didn't lock myself in my house, but believed the hype in March. However, looking at all of the information, how it was presented and the <strong>huge</strong> disconnect between MSM narrative and reality (a gap that just widens with time), I became a skeptic.</p>
