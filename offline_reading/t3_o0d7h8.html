<p>I’m very thankful for my education, because it helps me to think critically about the “science” we keep her with about. But you don’t need a formals education to think for yourself and process information. Like, anyone can look at their “science” and say, “that’s actually policy, not science”.</p>

        <p>I’m a power electronics engineer so my Thesis is on vector control of inverter fed induction machines. Using filters to smooth the output voltage means it can resonate and the filter adds a time delay to the control. You ask for something to change and it lags and it causes complications too long to list </p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong I’m not Einstein but I know how science works, how to publish papers and present results. I was trained to think critically and question everything which has me in turmoil over this Covid thing as when you get to the why part it gets hairy!</p>

        <p>So basically you have no background in immunology, virology, or epidemiology, yet you think you know more about vaccinations and the pandemic than qualified experts?  </p>
<p>Are you familiar with the Dunning-Kruger effect?  Part of thinking critically is knowing your limitations in understanding concepts that are beyond your expertise.  Based on your comment history I'd say this is where you're extremely deficient. </p>
<p>What is your theory?  That all these experts and government agencies are in collusion?</p>
<p>I understand vaccine hesitancy, but there is absolutely no reason to think they're more dangerous than the virus given the current data.</p>

        <p>Read Thomas Kuhn 'Structure of scientific revolutions' if you are still so misguided about science being objective pursuit of truth with no agenda possible to influence it. Majority of scientists in the guven field tend to support the dominant paradigm they have been brought in, even taking extrenely unscientific steps to do that.</p>

<p>This Covid censorship is another level altogether that company A showing their sensing system (for example) is x% more accurate </p>

<p>by N Le Bert · 2020 · Cited by 680 — This revealed that 17 years after infection, IFNγ responses to SARS-CoV peptides were still present </p>
<p>Why are they giving out vaccines to people who don’t need it? Like it’s not even mentioned anywhere that humanity survived because of natural immunity. We wouldn’t be here that’s not an exaggeration </p>
<p>ADE is the scary part for me, I want the vaccines to be safe more than anyone as so many friends and family took the jump</p>
<p>Like being exposed to a lab invented virus isn’t even a complaint, is that not concerning enough having to be exposed to genetic engineering? Clearly it’s not a problem just take your shot</p>
<p>The list of questions  is endless</p>

        <p>So if you have no symptoms, does taking the vaccine give you superpowers? I mean, it only makes sense! If you <em>already</em> have no symptoms, a "reduction" would put you into <em>negative symptoms</em>, which, logically speaking, means superpowers.  </p>

        <p>Traveling in Central America. Mexico requires nothing. So far the only country I've been to that accepts vaccine cards is el salvador. The rest require a PCR test generally. Nicaragua let us in with antigen tests (though they require pcr). No one looks at these things closely -- everyone we've met is just trying to keep their jobs, in my experience.</p>

&rt;No questions! You're not an "expert" in math!!!</p>
<p>That basically can sum up the whole response towards COVID and COVAX.</p>
<p>And it is the biggest warning sign that something is wrong, they know it is wrong, but they don't want to admit it.</p>
<p>Feels like we're in school, the teacher wrote something incorrect, and you're getting sent to the principal's office for pointing it out.</p>
<p>Now we are seeing people having health problems after taking COVAX (Hell I was seeing it in Europe with AstraZeneca prior to the issues in the US). The first time it was a coincidence, twice maybe, now it seems to be cropping up on a daily basis and when people try to ask about it, even if it is something mild, they are getting banned, insulted, and/or shut down.</p>
<p>So like you they come to a group like NNN and ask the same questions. Granted, they get plenty of "crazy, paranoid, or other" type answers, but we are at least answering the questions as best we can, and as time goes on we don't seem so crazy anymore.</p>

<p>I can totally argue these points from the other side.  It's amazing that they can't.  You could actually craft a cogent argument as to why they have all these changes in policy.  </p>

        <p>Let me see if I can clarify for each of your points. </p>
<p>&rt; schools </p>
<p>So kids are carriers for cov-sars-2 and can suffer from Covid (the manifestation of symptoms from the virus), but they are far less likely to die from it or have long-term repercussions (note: I said far less likely, not none).  In addition, studies came out showing that the transmission rate from kids to adults to be lower than adult to adult (kids because they develop symptoms less frequently typically carry a lower viral load) (note: I said lower transmission rate, not none).  Having kids not being educated over a long period of time is detrimental and many parents need their children at school so they can go to work.  All of this being said, schools reopened either all virtually, all physically, or a hybrid model to best accommodate the socio-economic environment of their areas.   Most schools that physically reopened or did a hybrid model did their best to have kids and staff wear masks and distance themselves (some schools did better than others and some where just a shitshow).  </p>
<p>&rt; vaccinate kids</p>
<p>So the original EUAs were for 16+ for Pfizer and 18+ for Moderna and J&amp;J.  Pfizer was able to produce clinical data for 12-15 later on so the FDA approved Pfizer for 12+ recently.  <em>No one is doing younger than that at this point</em>.  Moderna will likely submit data soon that will let them drop the age requirement to 12 as well.  Pfizer will finish trials on children by the end of Summer and probably submit the data and request to the FDA in September.  At that point, they may get approved to vaccinate under 12.  </p>
<p>&rt; No symptoms </p>
<p>We’ve actually been told this since nearly the start, but things have actually improved.  The early estimates were 80% of people were asymptomatic.  Recent data suggests this may be as low as 17% (this is good and bad. Good because fewer people to do asymptomatic spread. Bad because contrary to claims  most of the populace definitely hasn’t had it yet so no herd immunity from natural exposure).</p>
<p>&rt; How did it change  in such a radical way. </p>
<p>It didn’t.  In the case of Moderna and Pfizer, you’re chances of contracting drop 90+% and your chances of being symptomatic drop 97%.  Severe Covid and hospitalization become very low.    As for any changes, remember this is science.  Science is iterative so our understanding of this virus improves over time.  Like I said, the asymptotic percentage dropped significantly from early estimates.  Health care officials are operating on the best information they have at any given moment.   </p>
<p>&rt; Extend lockdown is ok</p>
<p>Most of us haven’t been in a lockdown since last May/June.  Most places have only been doing capacity and operating hours reductions and masks.   This is different from a lockdown.  States have fluctuated restrictions based on case counts.  California being probably the biggest.  California started reopening in May, only to have to put restrictions back in place because case counts starting climbing almost immediately.  </p>
<p>&rt; how can they be at risk if they are vaccinated</p>
<p>So vaccines are not 100% especially for the elderly.  Vaccines are typically less effective in the elderly and vulnerable.  Also the virus is not just harmful to the vulnerable.  Plenty of other people have been severely effected.  Vaccines provide their best protection when enough people are vaccinated that transmission effectively stops in a population — this is herd immunity.  </p>
<p>If you have other questions, I would be happy to assist if I can.  You can DM or chat if you like.</p>

        <p>You were banned because the answers to these questions are so obvious to a lot of people that asking them makes you appear disingenuous. Since you doubled down though, it seems you may be genuinely wondering. I'll address your points one by one, assuming you are willing to listen. </p>
<p>Yes, the early-days assumption that kids do not spread Corona was a major fuckup. Key word here is assumption: it wasn't a scientific opinion. As testing increased and more data became available, the scientific evidence showed the contrary, especially for new variants. The point is, no one claims kids can't spread the virus at this point, and kids have only started being vaccinated recently. So this is a development, not a contradiction. Just because yesterday I assumed it was going to be a sunny day, doesn't call into question my observation that it's raining today. It just proves I was wrong yesterday. </p>
<p>Yes, Covid's lack of symptoms was and still is a problem, because this indirectly increases the virus' transmissability. So if vaccines simply reduced minor symptoms, they could indeed be counterproductive. However, vaccines don't just reduce symptoms, they also directly reduce transmissability by up to 95%. They also prevent most severe cases, without which Covid isn't that much of an issue. I hope the upside here is obvious.</p>
<p>Finally: No one claims vaccines work 100% of the time, or that vaccinated people are completely invulnerable! (Although, that would probably be a great way to convince more people to take a vaccine, no? If they lie about so many things, why not this??) But the bigger worry is for the millions upon millions of people who refuse to take vaccines. Those are now the vulnerables to be protected. Perversely, if a new lockdown happens, it will be a vaccinated majority trying to protect the antivaxxers from themselves - yet it will be the antivaxxers protesting.</p>
<p>How long until the vaccinated majority says "fuck it, I want my freedom back, these people had their chance"? Anyone's guess.</p>

        <p>Maybe you were banned because you don't know how to use punctuation?</p>
<p>That squiggly thing at the end of that last sentence is called a "question mark".</p>

        <p>sounds like you are being all banned because you are all acting dumb.  <br>
like it sounds like none of you realize time is a continuous thing and that science is always being updated and new things are being discovered every day and that scientists are human beings.<br>
like this OP here is talking about points made last year 2020 and that today is 6/15/21 - a whole year after the requirements of last year.  last year we were all just learning about who/what was contagious who/what wasn't contagious - but it sounds like OP is astounded and/or confused at new covid knowledge which is now available - like - wow! - i thought that was written in stone for some reason &amp; now you people have changed all the rules.  <em>REALLY</em> - is that what the OP <em>REALLY</em> thought/thinks?  - no - he is "acting dumb" or "acting innocent".  (who? little 'ole me, i ain't no big scientist) - - - so really - stop doing that.</p>
