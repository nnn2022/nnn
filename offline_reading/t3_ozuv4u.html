    <strong>Where you get your information?</strong>
    <p><p>In a world where David Icke known as the father of the reptilian race, and many other conspiracies has got basically everything right in his predictions regarding covid since march 2020:</p>
<p>Vaccines 
Vaccines passports
Non isolated virus
Faulty tests
Variants coming from the vaccines 
And so on and on. </p>
<p>He has shown to be perhaps the best journalist of the last year and a half while the non conspiracy media outlets (aka MSM) have only feed us with pure crap and pushing the same nonsense narrative, regardless if left, right, up or down political view. </p>
<p>There are many intelligent people, more than me or you with more experience in life and even more academic degrees, example:</p>
<p>My wife's father, around 60, few academic diplomas, ex hippie, travelled the world, tried drugs (many and in large quantities), fought the system when younger and best of all french (allegedly the most intellectual people in the world).</p>
<p>She get her news from far left french sources (small news papers, respected radio shows, known as intellectual) which until the last 2 years they where "quiet" reliable in comparison with CNN and fox, this last year those outlets they became mainstream media. When I was with her at the phone I mentioned about all the protests, and she told me they were actually not much protests in France, I said didn't you see police marching with people and she said she didn't. Obviously the media that back few years would report what the whole world wouldn't report (such as images of police beating up people during protests, which the media wouldn't cover anywhere) they used to report it. </p>
<p>So imagine if for someone who was used all her life to get informed from those outlets that they have been "reliable", imagine for the rest of the world that 90% if not more can't exist without the TV on, and suddenly they bombard with all the propaganda they have been bombarded this and last year. Not that before last year they weren't promoting propaganda, on the contrary it, they been slowly programming for when this point would arrive. </p>
<p>How can you do against people who trust teh media outlets that they have trust all their lives, to suddenly ask them to check not YouTube but bitchute to get informed.</p>
<p>Lastly:</p>
<p>What are your media sources in August 2021?</p></p>

        <p>Ive seen some of the dark horse. </p>
<p>I saw that one with the mRNA guy and the one with the doctor specialist in lungs, it caught my attention that while they both talk about the dangers of the vaccine they both took it....</p>
<p>Also Eric Weinstein brother from the dark horse also took it. </p>
<p>I wonder why this people took the vaccine...? </p>
<p>I guess is that if they wouldn take it they would be considered conspiracy theorist and apparently that's a death sentence for people from academia.</p>

        <p>Eric is seen as a sort of genius, and the most intellectual guy in the world. I'm sure that plays with his ego. And you know, if you don't want the vaccine you're a antivaxxer conspiracy theorist.</p>
