    <strong>3 new permabans for "participating in a sub that contains misinformation". Fascism in action.</strong>
    <p><p>It's fine that loli-gore (pedo wtf) reddits exist, or fragilewhites (hatewhitey) exist, or 2Xchromos (hatemen) exist, or AHS (hate everyone aka we're fascist) exist, but to see censorship in action in real time is just a huge confirmation that wrong think is going to result in bans further solidifying the echo chamber. Any wrong think results in a deplatforming. The President of the United States was kicked off of social media. That's insane. The power of social media cannot be understated. People with differing viewpoints are being silenced and that is not okay. A reckoning is coming, whether it's two years or twenty, the country will right itself. Too much polarizing behavior will have consequences.</p></p>

        <p>Starting to think the reason we aren't banned yet, besides controlling the opposition, is it would leave about 14 die hard SJWs and just bots left on the site. Not good for Advertising revenue.</p>

        <p>I give them all my cut and paste reply: </p>
<p><strong>Lol! Banned from a subreddit that I am not subscribed to and would never visit for enjoying and supporting other subreddits? That's a laugh. Will I get banned from quilting circle or mad cat ladies of Guam next? GTFO, stop bothering me with your hen cackling. Blocked and forgotten.</strong></p>
<p>I'm so sick of the nonsense. There's no "truereddit" talk anymore, no real people having real discourse, real conversations. No give and take, no evaluating opinions or facts or data or personal experience or anecdotes, or anything at all. It's more than drive by news at this point, it's drive by life. </p>
<p>Agree/disagree about anything, politics, vaccines, religion, hair color sexuality, child rearing, there's no live and let live, no leeway, no tolerance, it's straight fascism. Where's the American ideal of being the best you can be by self determination?</p>
<p>Why does the color of my skin/car/hair/cat matter to the guy living next door?</p>
<p>Why can they wreck my livelihood over it? Holy shit the country's gone mad.</p>

        <p>Sorry it was late when I made the joke, although I did leave a /s so thats on you.</p>
<p>Anyway just pointing out how hypocritical that side is. They'll search your post history to discredit you, outright dox people who spread "misinfo" if you go hard enough, and basically not view you as a human.</p>
<p>Hence all the bans and such. Its a group, not individual people. And you gotta follow the group think to be allowed in.</p>
