        <p>They believe it only works if everybody buys in. Problem is we cant get everyone to buy into shit like dinosaurs existed or the world is round. You can forget shit like masks work, especially when the evidence is mixed at best.</p>

        <p>Virtue signallers are pretty terrible people. It's like the adage "if a man is nice, he won't have to tell you that he's nice" or, to reference GoT, "Any man who must say I am the King is no true king."</p>
<p>They are just bullies and terrible people who want a reason to feel morally superior to people - and when they have it, they will viciously attack completely validated by their own conscience. It's why people are so quick to group you into an "evil" group for opposing them these days (Nazi, racist, incel, etc), so they can attack you without remorse since you're not even a person, you're just a member of an evil group!</p>

        <p>To give the background on this, scottishpatter is an instagram account (private- you need to follow to see posts) with 535K followers, which posts funny Scottish dialect based jokes and humour.  Must admit I get a chuckle at most of them, although I'm not sure who this is sponsored by, or their commercial links.</p>
<p>This post was added yesterday, which seems to be captures of a dialogue from another app (possibly facebook).  It has ~32k likes.
It ends on the punchline:</p>
<p>&rt; Meanwhile in <em>actual</em> Scotland, we're wearing masks on public transport and in shops.  You know what else we're doing?  Counting deaths in single digits.  Most days that digit is zero.</p>
<p>This line itself has 2.5k reactions in the screencap, and you can only see that it was posted 'on Sat' which I will assume to be last saturday.</p>
<p>Another line with 1.8K likes:</p>
<p>&rt; As a born and bred Scotsman, I'm looking forward to your [referring to the unmasked people in the main picture] life expectancy being similar to that of 13th Century Scotland [short].</p>
<p>Masks in scotland are mandated in shops TODAY: Friday 10th July.  This is an 
increase on the public transport requirement which came into play on 22nd June.</p>
<p>My reality - the evidence I see with my eyes - is that the majority of people have not been wearing masks when in shops, hospitals, offices.  This has been the case for months -bar possibly at the beginning in large city supermarkets- , and only now is this being made mandatory in shops.  In the last few days cashiers working behind perspex screens in shops (perspex has been up for a good while) have begun wearing visors to meet the 'face-covering mandatory in shops' rule without blocking their mouths.</p>
<p>To attribute the low death figure to wearing of masks, in a post of this nature, looks like projection, certainly not based on any evidence.  Therefor I am calling the attached post out as misinformation.</p>

        <p>How is a disease that kills people at an average age of 80 years old and has a &lt;0.5% mortality rate going to set back our life expectancy to 13th century Scotland?</p>
