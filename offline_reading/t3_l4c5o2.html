    <p><p>9/11 and the monitoring of our communications to keep us safe.</p>
<p>The constant goalpost shifting. 2 weeks to flatten the curve. The vaccine is the end game. Now, the vaccine isn't the end game and we must continue as we are for the foreseeable, regardless.</p>
<p>To continue this madness is in the interest of those at the top of the financial and political pyramid. Just look at how much money the tech elites for example have made from this pandemic in a little over 12 months. It's staggering. What gets me is those that are against corporate elitism are the same one's pushing for harder lockdown in turn presenting these companies with further power and influence over their daily life.</p>
<p>See a trend here? I'm not a conspiracy theorist. I'm a coincidence theorist!</p>
<p>It's a shame only people in this sub have the ability to venture outside the matrix and see beyond the propaganda.</p></p>
