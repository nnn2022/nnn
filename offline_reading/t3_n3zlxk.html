    <strong>What are you after now?</strong>
    <p><p>We've all dealt with Covid for a year. Most places are now getting back to normal life. Restrictions are listing. Infection rates, death rates etc are all down. In most countries, a good enough percentage of people have been vaccinated or will be in the next couple of months.</p>
<p>So, all the mask mandates, social distancing rules etc are slowly being lifted. In some places, they have totally lifted them, and others will do so over the next 2 months.</p>
<p>This is all being done based off scientist and medical professionals advice, not in response to any protests or anything. It's just where we are now in the timeline of the pandemic. It's coming to an end of the restrictions.</p>
<p>Covid will probably always be here. But the risk profile has changed. Before, with limited knowledge, limited drugs to fight it, and no vaccine, the risk profile was high. Now, we have vaccines, drugs to reduce the symptoms and people will retain the caution of getting too close to people for a good few years, so the risk profile is lower.</p>
<p>So, I'm interested. What does everyone on this sub now?</p>
<p>Your main issues of "no more masks", "get back to normal", etc is happening anyway. You don't need to "fight" this - it is actually going to happen naturally. There's timelines already in place. </p>
<p>So, what else is it you're campaigning for now?</p></p>

        <p>It is not happening naturally at all. It’s happening because people are starting to wake up. When people saw Florida/Texas being completely open &amp; doing fine, they realized they could do the same. If it were up to the CDC things would be shut down forever. It takes people standing up and using their voice to break out of it - you can thank us later</p>

        <p>Most medical people think Florida and Texas are fucking idiots. But those same people are saying we are near the end and they've agreed dates for restrictions to end etc. So, it looks like it is happening naturally</p>

        <p>They can set dates all they want. It doesn’t mean they’ll follow through. DC just revoked its end to mask mandate after backlash. Biden said “just do it for 100 days”. It’s been 100 days. Just like 15 days to slow the spread, they assume you’ll forget because they think people are dumb</p>

        <p>wrong. i still have to wear a mask to buy groceries and other essentials. i still cannot travel without subjecting myself to tests, masks, quarantines, proof of vaccines. concerts and other cultural events continue to be cancelled throughout this year. if the president is giving "permission" to celebrate 4th of july, normal is not back yet. if the cdc is "approving" going maskless outside, normal is not back yet. i mean look around you. do you remember what normal life was like?</p>

        <p>i am suggesting that just because someone promises something, or talks about doing something in the future, it is not remotely the same as actually doing it.</p>
<p>you are talking about what you <em>assume</em> will follow things like "permission to go maskless outside." nobody has given a timeline or any concrete criteria for going "back to normal." which, by the way, is their job. it's their job to give clear messaging that is effective. not just parroting marketing phrases and saying "we'll have to see." we'll have to see what? what are we looking for? what numbers for which metrics will signify the end of the pandemic? this is their job and it's their whole job. and they do it very poorly.</p>
<p>so again, look around - do you still wear a mask to participate in society? have you been given "permission" to disregard mask rules if you're vaccinated? do politicians even demonstrate the supposed freedoms of the fully vaccinated among themselves? do they even let go of any of the theater? you recognize that masking in a room full of fully vaccinated people is theater, right? what materially has changed?</p>

        <p>The material changes recently, in my country at least, have been removing the ban on meeting up with multiple households, removal of the 2m distancing rule, they are allowing fans back into sporting and music events, there isn't a rule about masks outdoors anyway, restaurants and bars are open outdoors.</p>
<p>So, there's changes right there.</p>
<p>In other places, they've got rid of their mask mandates completely. That's a change.</p>
<p>Changes will keep happening over the next few months until we're all back to normal.</p>
<p>That will happen with or without people's protests, it's just happening naturally anyway.</p>

        <p>&rt; in my country</p>
<p>ok. i'm in america like most of the people on this board. so i don't know why you're asking about our feelings on social restrictions you aren't subject to and can only guess are being removed. i'm telling you how it is, in a city in a red state, currently today. we have not had a "mask mandate" at the state level since last spring.</p>
<p>i still cannot even volunteer in my community without bringing a box of masks, to work outside, with "social distancing" from others. i still wait in line to get into my grocery store because of limits. the art museum moves people through on appointment. basically all opportunity to socialize with my community has been kneecapped by hygiene theater when 1. they admit outdoor transmission is tiny 2. they admit 6 feet is bullshit 3. they admit surface to surface transmission is almost nonexistent.</p>
<p>so there is no point in any of this except to give people a false sense of control over a force of nature. but i don't need lies to feel better and i shouldn't have to keep up the charade. it's their job to say "ok when you're vaccinated you no longer have to x, y, or z," "when infection rate has been below 1 for 2 weeks, restrictions will be lifted," "when daily cases are below 100 in an area, restrictions will be lifted." they say NONE of this. it's just "do what we say now, and maybe later we can talk about that carrot i dangled in front of you."</p>

        <p>&rt;So, what else is it you're campaigning for now?</p>
<p>This is just the beginning. You will now be required to vaccinate to travel overseas. That will never stop. Once this precedent is set, you can be asked to take vaccinations for anything in order to fly. You can be asked to take boosters every six months. You can be told that the virus has mutated, and you need a vaccine for that.</p>
<p>This can also seep into domestic life. You can be asked to prove your vaccine status to do all manner of things. Just so that what you do, where you are, and who are you can be tracked. Even more than it is now.</p>
<p>If you don't fight this, it will continue forever. There are lots of other things that could follow the basic restriction of movement. These have been well-documented by so-called conspiracy theorists for many years. The conspiracy theorists were mocked. Now most of the things that the conspiracy theorists have predicted are happening. Mass vaccination programmes and restricted liberty / increased monitoring, etc, were predicted many years ago. I have known about this goal for at least 10 years.</p>
<p>I would stop short of making predictions about what could occur, but check China out as an example. You will no doubt say today that we could never have a system of social credit in the West, it goes against our culture. I would say to that...look how quickly and easily people folded on mass vaccination, masks, social distancing, following the government guidelines, and buying into the Covid narrative.</p>
<p>I repeat. This is just the beginning. The gloves are off now. Anything is possible. And whatever happens, most people will queue up for it. They'll even defend it to the death if some people question it. And the people that ordered masks, vaccines, social distancing, and all of the other nonsense, know this.</p>

        <p>We did have the drugs to fight it actually - they just censored people suggesting using those alternatives.</p>
<p>The only thing that’s changed is that a “vaccine” is available. Except, now we don’t know anything about the “vaccine” as it’s experimental. I hope for your sake you didn’t blindly trust the $cience and get vaxxed. But I’m assuming you did, all we can do for you now is pray for you. You are a guinea pig in this mass experiment...good luck!</p>

        <p>Lockdowns will only happen in tiny isolated geographical locations, if there's a sudden spike for some reason.</p>
<p>Masks are a bit ingrained to people so it may continue but the rules mandating it will stop.</p>
<p>And what's your issue with vaccine passports? It will probably not happen but just showing someone a card doesn't feel like a big issue.</p>

        <p>Vaccine identification is a massive violation of your privacy and civil liberties, and the idea that you should have to give up your right to privacy around your own health to private corporations is unacceptable. It's not simply 'showing somebody a card'. Anybody who has any understanding of how personal privacy has been violated by corporations and governments over the last couple of decades should be extremely suspicious of the motivations behind any kind of ID system.</p>

        <p>Firstly, it's not all of your medical information.</p>
<p>It's simply something that says you got vaccinated. Anyone watching you go into the doctors would know that. Most people are posting that they got vaccinated on Facebook. It's hardly a massive secret.</p>
<p>No one cares what illnesses you had in the past, or what weird medication you're on now. It's simply something saying "yeah I've been vaccinated so my risk of getting ill when I'm in your business, or on your cruise, or on your phone etc is as low as it can be".</p>
<p>It'll probably be a requirement of that businesses insurance policy anyway. And it'll definitely be a requirement of any health insurance against Covid.</p>
<p>I have absolutely no problem with people knowing I've been vaccinated. My friends will know because I'll post about it. I don't care what strangers know about me. And most people will be proud of it anyway. It's not going to be a big secret like you think.</p>

        <p>We're definitely going to have to agree to disagree about that. They were enough people in society to cosign his bullshit so yeah I can't agree with you on that. </p>
<p>Here's a better argument. In some African and Middle Eastern countries, if you ask them if they consider homosexuality a mental illness, you probably won't get the most PC answer. According to your post, that's okay, if more people believe or agree with something then majority rules and it's fine. That's my biggest issue with your argument. A lot of horrible shit has happened and continues to happened simply because the majority said it was okay.</p>

        <p>Your assessment that this is over is a little optimistic in my opinion even though we have seen some signs of improvement.
There is consideration of what the sub would become if it all actually ended but if nothing else, this should be a place for all of us who became alienated from the intolerance towards idea that started to pervade the entirety of reddit a few years back.</p>

        <p>I do love talking shit, but there’s a legit issue here that I believe was spawned by the internet/Tea Party/Trump phenomenons of the last 20 years.  We have a subset of our population that believes in nothing: media, government, science.  They believe whatever conspiracy theory speaks the loudest on their screen.  It’s what led to January 6, is what led to the widespread vaccine reluctance, and it’ll lead to some other nasty outcome next.</p>
