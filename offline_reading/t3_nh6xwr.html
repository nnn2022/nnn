    <strong>Found Someone Resisting the New Normal in the Wild--Don't Forget You Can Have an Impact</strong>
    <p><p>Having a bad day, accidentally left my coffee at home. I walked into the local Tim's to grab one and everything was blocked off except for a narrow aisle right at the counter. I get my coffee and the guy in front of me is waiting for a bagel or something. The woman behind the counter goes "I'm sorry but because of the six-foot rule, I have to ask you to wait until he's done to leave the store." Because they blocked off all the other room! </p>
<p>But this guy is not having it. He goes, "Oh no, go ahead," and moves back all he can and gestures. So I walk through and thank him. </p>
<p>Hilariously he leaves a few seconds after me and says, "They're a bit crazy in there, eh?"</p>
<p>And we have a pleasant chat for a bit. </p>
<p>Don't forget that even though the government has essentially weaponized corporations against us (here in Ontario), you can give people permission to break the rules when they are pretending to protect your safety.</p></p>
