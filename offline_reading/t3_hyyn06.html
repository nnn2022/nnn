    <strong>Can we talk about New Jersey? Low cases and deaths - still locked down hard.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm a lifelong NJ resident and I really love the state. The food, the wildlife, the fact that you can go from beaches to mountains to farms to cities in a stretch of 300 miles, so many things. We get portrayed as the armpit of the country, but that's mostly nonsense from people whose only exposure to the state is watching TV.</p>
<p>Our governor, Phil Murphy, at first struck me as reasonable enough, but the pandemic has really demonstrated his mismanagement of the state. We bore the brunt of the first wave along with NYC, during which we lost thousands in nursing homes, but along with that came the unintended consequence of Murphy aping Andrew Cuomo and crying for federal money and tens of thousands of ventilators.</p>
<p>Whether it was our stricter-than-most mitigation efforts or just the natural progression of the virus, the curve has been smashed into submission. The crisis he cried about never came. We are a state of 9 million people averaging about 400 cases per day. We have less than 700 people statewide in the hospital, 135 of which are in the ICU and 60 of which are on ventilators. That curve sounds flat to me. But the restrictions still won't loosen.</p>
<p>No movie theaters, no indoor dining, no gyms. Just got the yoga/dance/Pilates studios open last week (even though my favorite was open secretly). Indoor dining was slated for July 2. Murphy got spooked about spiking cases in FLORIDA and rescinded permission, leaving thousands of restaurants stocked with food, rehired staff, and no indoor dining. His catchphrase of "data determines dates" is just a tagline. Never has he stated what data benchmark will lead to more things opening, or when.</p>
<p>The best part is how his administration has manipulated and massaged the data to make our progress look less significant. Until last week, the hospital numbers were presumed to be all COVID patients - they never told us otherwise. NOW they reveal that only half of those patients were tested positive and the other half were awaiting test results. But here's the best part.....the average "deaths per day" are high teens or low 20s. They however just revealed last week that that number includes deaths from as far back as March that are JUST NOW being confirmed and added to the daily totals.</p>
<p>They posted today that there were 17 deaths. But how many people died in the last 24 hours?</p>
<p>Two.</p>
<p>This is a sham and I'm starting to get pissed. Thanks for hearing me out. Please sound off if you're in the Northeast and you can relate.</p></p>

        <p>This isn't about the virus anymore (if it ever was) it's all about control and power. The lockdown doesn't affect them in the slightest, it doesn't matter to them if this lasts indefinitely. The fact that people are obsessed with masks now and there's a overwhelming support for them (even though they're mostly pointless) shows that the majority of people will comply and basically becomes the government's bitch. Since they now got the masses controlled and scared, they're gonna push for more restrictions and take away the peoples rights slowly by the day under the illusion of "we're just saving lives!" or "better be safe than sorry." They can follow through with whatever agenda they want now because the <em>people</em> supported this and became a brainless, masked cult and showed they will listen to whatever big daddy government says and does to feel "safe." </p>
<p>Am I going on the conspiracy side? Maybe, but its really the only logical reason I can think of for this situation. Why else are they talking about canceling events to next year and creating mask mandates and other restrictions with no end dates in sight?</p>
