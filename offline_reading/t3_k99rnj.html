    <strong>Anyone else starting to have their personal lives policed by their job?</strong>
    <p><p>I work on a university medical campus. My boss, who has literally been in his house since March, held a zoom meeting where he told us that:</p>
<p>A) Because of the Thanksgiving “disaster” (he didn’t elaborate what that meant, we don’t have any campus outbreaks) the school is now implementing new policies for holiday interactions.</p>
<p>B) If you interact with anyone who hasn’t been quarantining, regardless of them being positive or sick or not, you must quarantine yourself for 14 days before returning to work. </p>
<p>C) If you travel at all outside of a 10 mile bubble you have to quarantine for 14 days before returning to work.</p>
<p>D) This is all the case even if masks are worn.</p>
<p>I quickly shut all of this down because it has apparently never occurred to my boss that other people aren’t loner WFH shut ins like him. I told him that my boyfriend works with the public closely and neither of us quarantine. I live with other people who travel and don’t quarantine and also work customer facing roles. Even if I didn’t live with them, if I rode the bus or did anything like that I would basically never be able to come to work according to his rules. </p>
<p>A coworker of mine also confronted him about this and my boss claimed it was all University policy. We all dug around and found nothing of the sort from  the University. My boss claimed he would find it and get back to us, it’s now been 5 days and he hasn’t gotten back to us but he has taken it up with the chair of our department. </p>
<p>Ridiculous. Even if this was the policy, most people would just lie. It all discriminates against anyone who doesn’t live alone or lives with people who work “essential” jobs. It hints at a new precedent, that your job is now required to know what you do in your personal time, and fuck that. Looks like lying is part of this “new normal” people want.</p></p>

        <p>There was an attempt at my fiance's work to do something like that in the spring by the general manager. Thankfully my fiance is at the same level as him and he shut that down before it became a thing.</p>
<p>I don't think workplaces can enforce such a thing seeing that they don't own you. What you do off the clock is not their buisnesses. I am sorry you're dealing with that though. Seems workplaces are really crossing the line.</p>

        <p>Universities are the worst for this type of enforcement. </p>
<p>The students who've been allowed to stay on campus are under tyrannical rule. </p>
<p>I wouldn't have told him all my personal business. Because be can use those admissions as grounds to prevent you from coming in. Why would you even admit your roommates travel? He didn't need to know that. </p>
<p>Not a great time to get fired. Simply ignore the rules that don't make sense. </p>
<p>You already did the right thing by asking for the proof that these were the rules and it seems he was lying. If he wasn't, oh well those rules are ridiculous and they can't prove you're doing any of these things so they'll just have to make a liar out of you. </p>
<p>Most people aren't following the covid guidelines to the letter, so any workplace demanding full compliance is in for a ride.</p>
<p>You'd have to quarantine 24/7 because of you go grocery shopping you have no idea of knowing whether those people are quarantining or not.</p>

        <p>I only brought up my personal situation because I know my boss can’t actually do anything about it. Basically the rules as he described them would only work for someone who lives alone and never goes anywhere. And big surprise here, my boss lives alone and never goes anywhere. He hasn’t once considered that not everyone lives in that situation.</p>
<p>It turns out it isn’t actually university policy at all, my boss just made it up because he’s losing his grip. He couldn’t find it on university policy pages either which is why he questioned the chair and we haven’t heard anything back so I’m thinking he didn’t get the doomer answer he wanted (luckily the chair has been very lax and cool during this whole year).</p>

        <p>I would argue that most people don’t live alone, between spouses/significant others, roommates, children and other family members. Especially in today’s economy, people have had to get roommates or move back in with their parents due to financial concerns. Some people, like me, have done it out of loneliness and depression too. No clue how he thinks this is enforceable.</p>

        <p>My boss is brilliant in a handful of very specific topics but utterly dense and clueless about the rest of life in general. He has been granted the life he always wanted, alone and at home in a chair staring at a screen and being a fat ass. I would actually bet money he’s a ~40 year old virgin. He thinks it’s enforceable because he doesn’t think. He thinks everyone on the outside has been playing along with all the doomer bullshit.</p>

        <p>I’m not too concerned, he has no power over us in that regard. We only have to follow University “rules” and up until this point, there isn’t any “rule” about declaring anything about your personal life. I’m just shocked he would be that bold and dense as to believe any of this is true and that we would all just obediently declare who we hang out with to our jobs.</p>
<p>I told him I saw no one for Thanksgiving and that wasn’t true.</p>

        <p>It isn’t, which is why I immediately questioned it and pointed out obvious flaws. Like it would unfairly target people who live with someone who works with the public. Turns out my boss basically just pulled it from his ass because he’s starting to become disconnected from reality.</p>

        <p>The only thing that's mandatory instead of just suggested is following Dictator Cuomo's bogus out-of-state travel nonsense.  And even then, it's not like they're tracking employees' locations so you could theoretically just hide the fact that you traveled out of state.</p>
<p>Having said that, a lot of us are still careful about what ends up online/social media.  Students <em>have</em> been suspended from campus due to videos and pictures surfacing of them at parties.  I wouldn't put it past them to give faculty/staff the same treatment.  I know that a few of my coworkers who I'm close friends, were not telling people what their -actual- Thanksgiving plans were.</p>

        <p>Yeah I have not shared anything on social media in years and I’m not going to start. My entire social life has moved underground and I only share what I actually do with people I trust.</p>
<p>After all this nonsense from my boss, I’m no longer telling him anything, I’m playing pretend that I live the doomer life. They’re creating liars out of all of us.</p>

        <p>I don't even have any social media except for my shitty Facebook that I made in high school 13 years ago and now only ever use for Marketplace and Messenger.</p>
<p>Personally, my main concern is that I'm active in a lot of gigging bands and they always tag me in shit.  Sometime down the road, there may be an overlap between when I start playing gigs again and when the university stops policing everyone's personal lives.  I have a feeling that navigating that is going to be like a minefield.</p>

        <p>That's the only thing that is mandatory at my job.  That and biweekly testing 🙄 </p>
<p>I wouldn't follow the quarantine either.  Who is even keeping track of that?  How can they prove that you traveled out of state?  I was "quarantined" due to "potential exposure" and I didn't follow that.  Nobody knew or cared.</p>

        <p>My plan is now a mixture of lying, reverse gaslighting, and ignoring him. Every question he asks of me I respond with my own lie and a sarcastic question for him to deflect him. Like if he asks if I hung out with anyone for Christmas I’ll say no even if I had a 30 person orgy. I’ll then ask him if he cooked ham for Christmas because I read an article that swine flu might cause the new tripletdemic.</p>

        <p>Oh I certainly do. And I will so more now. As I’ve said in another comment, the more ridiculous these rules get, the less of a grip any organization will have on whats actually going on. We already have a daily health attestation form that includes things like lethargy, headaches, and muscle soreness as symptoms you have to report.
