        <p>They had large amounts of bacterial pneumonia during the Spanish flu- also a time of mandated masking. It‚Äôs just common sense that wearing the same filthy mask all day long will eventually lead to other health issues.</p>

        <p>It's not even not cleaning and rewearing masks. It's kids, particularly the younger ones, having the remarkable ability to take a perfectly clean mask and turn it into a soggy, germ ridden death trap in 25 minutes flat. Unfortunately my 4 and 6 year olds have had to wear a mask for school and various stores throughout this. I never rewear them, shelf like on a mask for them is 3 hours tops. Literally put a mask on my 4 year old as we walked to the store and by the time we got inside it was wetü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§Æ </p>
<p>We shouldn't be making children wear masks. It's unsanitary no matter how much you try to keep them clean.</p>

        <p>That's what happens when you require children to wear masks for the last 15 months or whatever. Better that they would have caught COVID than these viruses.</p>
<p>And now they're citing this as a reason for children to wear a mask even longer? WTF?</p>

        <p>How about the fact that they've had dirty, microbe-riddled masks strapped to their faces for a year? Or that our immune systems need the "practice" that common colds and germs provide, and you've kept kids away from their friends and practice germs for over a year?</p>

        <p>This is what happens when you lock children inside away from all other human contact for a year. I've seen posts online about how great it was that their kids weren't getting sick. I was just thinking just you wait, it's gonna come back and hit you like when your child first started daycare or school. They need to be exposed to viruses and germs so their immune systems learn to fight them off. Any parent will tell you, when they first start daycare or school it's one illness after the other for a while. But then it stops and they're fine. These people have reset their kids immune system and now they get to live thru that fun year of sickness again.</p>

        <p>Last year, in June, when we finished with remote school, we started spending a significant amount of time outdoors. One of my kids broke out in hives almost right away. I called my pediatrician, thinking it was a seasonal environmental allergy, and he said that he'd been seeing it in a lot of kids - they spent so much time indoors in the spring that they ended up mildly allergic to sun!</p>
<p>It went away with additional exposure to sun, but that was wild.</p>
