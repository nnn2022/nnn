        <p>Once my state lifted the mask mandate, I carried one around at work in case a customer asked me to put it on or something, but it didn’t happen. After a week I stopped and still haven’t had any customers ask (been a month or so, Idaho)</p>

        <p>I never obey any of this trash. If you stand up for yourself, the same will apply to you. Why would you care if people get pissed off ? You don't exist to keep the peace with the brainwashed sheep. Your rights are far more important than their fear.</p>

        <p>In Ireland it's against the law to not wear one in public while indoors.</p>
<p>Over 300 €80 fines have been handed out.</p>
<p>In the beginning, all retail staff and security were strict about allowing access unless you wore one. Now I feel like everyone's energy is wasted and those same people couldn't give a crap now. </p>
<p>I work retail and I usually leave it under my chin until a customer approaches. The kiosk I work at is in the middle of the floor with stores either side but security have came and had conversations while I had it under my chin. If a customer doesn't wear theirs, or doesn't have one, I don't pull mine up. I'm seeing how much I can get away with without someone blowing up at me.</p>
<p>It seems nobody cares, really, they just wear one because they're asked and it's only for a few minutes. I'm quite a quiet person so I don't have the energy to argue with those opposing my views, other than to tell them I'll wear one if you feel uncomfortable talking to me (if we must, otherwise, feck off). My rule is either we can be two metres apart without one or if we need to get closer then I can wear one if you are paranoid and feel at risk. People mostly just pull them down as we chat because I can't bloody hear them over the music and screens. Or approach at the side where there is no "protective screen". Ngl though I've had customers accidentally spit at me before and there's also visible proof on the screens so I'm kinda happy to keep the screen lol. 
I'm exhausted from it and my heart truly goes out to those forced to wear one (GPS, hospital staff etc).</p>

        <p>Probably best to avoid conflict. I’ve heard of a few people in my area getting slapped around by store owners for not complying with the rules.  Shop owners are just trying to be as safe as possible and get pretty angry I think when antimaskers don’t comply.</p>
