    <strong>2016, Moderna raised lot of $ for mRNA drugs.</strong>
    <p><p>Frome the article (not dated, but probably december 2016):</p>
<p><em>This promise has made Moderna chief executive Stéphane Bancel into one of the most successful fundraisers in the industry’s history and has given him a near $500 million fortune. Moderna has raked in investor cash from the likes of billionaire Andreas Halvorsen’s Viking Global Investors and Wellington Management. Pitchbook puts its valuation at $4.7 billion–more than any publicly traded biotech without a drug on the market. Bancel, 44, a Harvard M.B.A. with a background in sales and operations, is named on many of Moderna’s patents. So enthusiastic is he about his startup that he has accumulated his 10% stake by boosting his initial stake with additional purchases during each of Moderna’s fundraisings.
Big pharma is also lining up to get in on Bancel’s Moderna. In 2013 the startup signed a deal with AstraZeneca that included a $240 million cash payment , followed by a $140 million investment this year. A 2014 agreement with the rare-disease specialist Alexion reeled in a $100 million payment and a $25 million investment. This year Merck paid $200 million so Moderna would help it develop cancer vaccines. In total, Moderna has raised $1.9 billion from eager partners and investors.</em></p>

        <p>Now, I'm wondering how Moderna could have been promoting his mRNA drugs without "da covid killer's" help.</p>
<p>What would have been theirs first mRNA drugs? An mRNA anti-cancer drug?</p>
<p>They have raised lot of money, so will they bring a new HIV mRNA cure? cancer vaccine?</p>
<p>Can we expect that since they created a "vaccin" covid in less than 2 weeks, they could create a lot of new ones now: it seems that lot of people are ready to "Trust the Science". So can I expect?</p>
