    <strong>Whatever happened to people minding their own business?</strong>
    <p><p>One thing I've noticed throughout this entire debacle is that people always complain about others wearing/not wearing masks, or getting or not getting the vaccine and so on. When push comes to shove, who the hell cares? I for one literally do not care if someone wears a mask or gets the vaccine, or chooses not to. That is their choice and their choices are none of my business.</p>
<p>I am so sick and tired of people bitching about others going out and being normal, not wearing masks, etc. Because in the end, it's none of their damn business. It never was and it never will be. If you want to be an antisocial shut in for the rest of your life, feel free to do that. Go ahead, that's the beauty of choosing. Just don’t expect everyone else to be as miserable as you. Nobody is forcing you to go out. I've had enough of these losers complaining about people wanting to work, go to school, or socialize with friends and family. Get a life and leave us alone.</p></p>

        <p>It has been people's opportunity to bring out their inner tyrant.  Usually powerless, now the simple act of donning a piece of fabric conferred hero status upon them.  How much more of a delight to publicly shame and spurn those who wouldn't do the same!</p>
<p>Masking was also psychological conditioning for the vaccine, IMO.  Western society heavily revolves around appearance.  Get people wearing something to signal "we're in this together" then anyone who doesn't is immediately cast as the opposite.  This mentality has now expanded to the vaccine.</p>
<p>Dumb lefties can't seem to see how government disguises their tyranny as benevolence.  Useful idiots.</p>

        <p>I disagree. I'm religious too and I try my best not to be a hypocrite, but it's human to fail to live up to your ideal. Then again you can only <em>be</em> a hypocrite if you have something to strive for that you fall short of. The important thing is if you keep trying to be better. I personally wouldn't give a shit if a stranger sat right next to me in church. You think Mother Theresa was concerned about her own health when she went to work with lepers in the slums of Mumbai?</p>
<p>I won't deny that many humans have used religion as a cover for their power-hungry &amp; murderous impulses, but you don't know history well if you think religion is the cause of most evil (Maybe leave out Islam, as Mohammed, their actual <em>founder,</em> was quite the pillager and murderer) In the last century alone, the leaders/systems responsible for the most mass-murder were decidedly <em>anti-religious</em>, i.e., Hitler, Stalin, Mao.</p>

        <p>The word you’re looking for is “busybody.”  There is an entire generation of people who have been socialized to see themselves as heroes, not insufferable annoyances, when they take on this mantle. </p>

<p>But if it's so important that you prevent people from killing something <em>which you personally believe to be human</em>, and which isn't even related to you in any way, then it makes perfect sense that someone would do anything to protect their fully formed, unquestionably human relative, even if it goes against your interests.</p>

        <p>The argument against that is: A person who has an abortion is killing another human (and anti-abortion folks say that's bad).  A person who doesn't wear a mask is creating a ridiculously tiny risk of spreading a virus that they have a ridiculously tiny chance of having. In my case, as I'll point out on social media, I have had a negative antibody test (i.e. I've never had it), negative COVID test (i.e. I don't have it now), and now I'm vaccinated.  Any time I've worn a mask because I had to, has done EXACTLY ZERO to protect anyone else, except maybe in their imaginations.</p>

<p>So yeah, you're taking chances, tiny chances perhaps, as you say, <em>with many lives</em>. Abortion would take one life, <em>if you believe that's actually life</em>, but in this case it only affects you personally.

<p>Are they really, or is that statistic a result of erroneous testing causing false positives combined with coding every positive who dies as a Covid-related death no matter how they died? How can we trust statistics that label a murder victim as a Covid-related death?</p>

<p>Assuming for the sake of argument your premise is accurate, there's a distinct difference between intentional ending of a life and an impossible to quantify remote chance that I have a high enough viral load to spread the virus yet not feel any symptoms. And again that's assuming your premise is valid, which I don't agree.</p>

<p>I agree with that. I'm just saying the reliability is so bad that it could be as low as 10% of what's reported. There's just so much that doesn't add up, but we're missing information and context that would explain it. </p>
<p>&rt;But if some people believe it's a thing, what makes their belief less important than your own?</p>
<p>This goes back to what I said in the other part of the thread.</p>
<p>&rt;Secondarily, the people being the most dramatic about it aren't really concerned about grandma. It's their own mortality they're freaking out about. Grandma is a convenient way to signal virtue and simultaneously hide the fact they're actually being completely selfish by insisting everyone do things for THEIR benefit. It's a transparently disgusting pathology of weakness and fear, and we rightly mock it. They should be ostracized for their hysterical, cowardly, and self-serving moralizing.</p>
<p>There are of course people who do live in multigenerational households, and those people do sometimes have jobs that don't allow them to work from home. However those people are the primary party responsible for their family's safety. I reject the shift from personal to collective responsibility for personal safety. Once we go down that road for this, we are headed towards totalitarian justifications for all kinds of restrictions on personal liberties.</p>

<p>It's not that we don't care if grandma dies. It's that we don't believe she will because of us.</p>
<p>The primary reason is that users here are aware that asymptomatic spread has been vastly overhyped, and may well not exist in a different way than someone developing the flu could spread it before their symptoms became undeniable. We don't believe there is a reasonable likelihood that we somehow have a high enough viral load to make someone else sick yet not feel sick ourselves. This is especially borne out by the countless stories of testing positive and never showing any symptoms. </p>

<p>Not at all. The life we're talking about would be more similar to bacteria than an old man, at the early stages.</p>

<p>On a biological level, that might be fair assessment. But our plane of discussion is obviously philosophical. Your statement informs the discussion but doesn't act as an argument in and of itself.</p>
<p>If we're going to value the human life on a sliding scale as you have done, let's compare the zygote and the elderly.</p>
<p>A nascent human life has a definable average potential that is hugely positive in terms of its contribution to the population. Further, every zygote is a potential genius that could solve the problems of humanity more quickly. Every time we kill one, we limit our collective potential.</p>
<p>An old person who doesn't produce anything and instead consumes disproportionate resources as we add stopgap after stopgap to delay the inevitable is undeniably a financial black hole. They have the opposite impact on collective potential because they consume valuable resources that could otherwise be redirected to investment in technological development.</p>
<p>Why, if we're judging the value of life on a sliding scale, does it not make sense to kill the old person instead of the zygote?</p>
<p>Or does it make more sense to value every human life equally and not start down the road of relative value of human life?</p>
<p>&rt;I maintain it's hypocritical to want to police other people's lives based on your own beliefs, and then complain when someone does the same to you.</p>
<p>You frame it as policing others' lives, but we see it as protecting the rights of an innocent human being. It's not that we want to interfere in the life of another. It's that doing so is necessary for the objective of saving an innocent human life, and we value the innocent human's rights over the unfortunately negative impacts on the mother.</p>
<p>&rt;You seem to think your own beliefs are valid and respectable while other people's beliefs are dumb and should have no weight in society.</p>
<p>Mindreading horseshit. I judge every individual and their opinions independently. Sometimes people change my mind.</p>
<p>I think it's you that's closed off, not me.</p>
<p>&rt;With that premise there's no discussion to be had so let's just agree to disagree and move on.</p>

        <p>&rt; You're free to believe that</p>
<p>It's a scientific fact, not a belief. From the moment of conception, the zygote is a unique human life with its own DNA. That's basic biology.</p>
<p>&rt;I'm just calling out the hypocrisy of being against abortion, like I assume most users here are, while laughing at someone being afraid of them indirectly "killing grandma".</p>
<p>I think there's a few of reasons for that you don't understand.</p>
<p>The primary reason is that users here are aware that asymptomatic spread has been vastly overhyped, and may well not exist in a different way than someone developing the flu could spread it before their symptoms became undeniable. We don't believe there is a reasonable likelihood that we somehow have a high enough viral load to make someone else sick yet not feel sick ourselves. This is especially borne out by the countless stories of testing positive and never showing any symptoms. </p>
<p>Secondarily, the people being the most dramatic about it aren't really concerned about grandma. It's their own mortality they're freaking out about. Grandma is a convenient way to signal virtue and simultaneously hide the fact they're actually being completely selfish by insisting everyone do things for THEIR benefit. It's a transparently disgusting pathology of weakness and fear, and we rightly mock it. They should be ostracized for their hysterical self-serving moralizing.</p>

        <p>the problem with this argument is that everyone's behavior affects everyone else. the nature of individual liberties is that they end where you begin infringing on someone else's. your freedom to do what you want is not unlimited- you do not have the freedom to, for example, steal other people's stuff. or murder them. or rape them. it's not "just your business"- it infringes upon someone else's right to own things/not be killed/not be raped.</p>
<p>the nature of a pandemic is that personal choice is in direct conflict with public health. the straightforward <em>best</em> outcome is for everyone to just quarantine and actually rid ourselves of the virus completely. entire countries managed it. the united states is absolutely not one of them, because people believed that their personal liberties were more important than our collective ability to rid ourselves of a pandemic.</p>
<p>you surely must see this, which means that your argument really is "i just don't care about how it effects other people". which if that's really how you feel then fine, but own up to it. don't sit there and say "i'm just doing what i want and making my own choices" as if those choices exist in isolation because they don't.</p>

        <p>Nope.  It's pure bullshit of you to accuse other people of "just.. (not) car(ing) about how (what I do) effects(sic) other people".  <strong>You</strong> never gave a care about any other infectious disease until this one....... certainly not to the point that you'd wear a mask and publicly shame people who disagree with your mindset about how to handle contagious diseases.</p>

        <p>actually i'm pretty sure every considerable and responsible adult stayed home when sick previously, and only assholes continued to go to work and expose people to illness? the whole "go to work when you're sick/tough it out as a badge of honor" thing is bullshit and always has been, it's selfish and inconsiderate. so yeah, i think people with fucking brains did care previously.</p>
<p>that said, i think it's closer to acceptable to "tough it out" with a cold than it is here. by a lot. covid is nowhere close to a cold. people are fucking dying, permanently losing their smell/taste, and having long term heart and lung complications.</p>

        <p>Quarantine actually means you quarantine if you are sick. Not quarantine if there’s nothing wrong with you. And whilst I care about my fellow man, I have a job that’s virtually disappeared and so sorry but right now I care about my own life and getting by and surviving. No one cared about me and my health in the past if I was sick. No one asked  me if I had had a flu shot before. It’s all total bullshit. And yeah. Other people’s behavior does affect everyone else. Governments locking down huge amounts of the population, yeah, their behavior affects me big time. Ant you are comparing covid to rape??</p>

        <p>The masks that you say are unproven have been used by medical professionals for decades to prevent the spread of germs and illnesses so clearly they are proven. Second, every death caused by COVID is proof that you could be walking around unknowingly transmitting it plus do no other viruses or diseases spread asymptomatically? No of course not so if others can why do you think it’s impossible COVID can?</p>

        <p>You're also talking about being in an environment where there are a ton of sick people confined in the same space.  Wearing an N95 mask with a face shield walking through Walmart is just neurotic.  It's not just about the efficacy of masks it's the necessity and proportional use of them.  People wearing them outside are just retarded.  IMO.</p>

        <p>You're right.  I always bring up the respirator and face shield when talking to the doomers because I think it's good enough for the grocery store if you're afraid of the rona. That's when you find out they don't care about safety they just care about control.</p>

        <p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I will say though, there is a lot of mask research pre-covid, and even that shit didn't look good. A lot of spread is aerosolization, and those aren't very effective.</p>
<p>But yeah, I know for them it's about compliance. Somewhere deep down I think they know it's mostly bunk.</p>

        <p>They skip over the doomers lack personally responsibility part or think wearing an N95 mask along with a face shield is ineffective or think I want to force them to wear a mask. </p>
<p>This isn't the first time. </p>
<p>My biggest problem with this community is they're selfish. They only care about masks, nobody here gives a shit about all the people out of work and locally owned restaurants, gyms and bars that have gone out of business they've been forced to close by the government. </p>
