    <strong>THESE PEOPLE SCARE ME!!!</strong>
    <p><p>I live in a city of 100k people and I just came across this professor of Immunology who is advocating and working HARD to make VACCINES Mandatory in the only university in the whole province. Mind you I'm an international student and the way I've been coping is by thinking that people are nice but they are just going along with this mess because they don't actually know what's happening and how mandatory vaccines and passports are INHUMAN. </p>
<p>But to see this guy and his fellows on Twitter and then so many other EXPERTS saying you don't have a right to gather indoors  so my body my choice argument is futile and you should not be allowed to go to bars, restaurants and cafes without showing your vaccine passport is just common sense. LIKE HOLY fucknig shit... what?? This guy wants to have this incentive in my city for the young people so that more of them take the vaccine. He says it's working in France and so many of the best universities in USA are making vaccines mandatory so why is this university not taking the health of its students seriously. </p>
<p>He scares me to death. I never want to see him or talk to him. Nor with the other stupid professors in the university, all of whom are advocating and working to make vaccines mandatory. How evil can people be? I  am scared of them. Of the news anchors, the editors, the writers, and countless other people who will work hard to ostracize another group of people and not think twice. I am scared for the students working with these EVIL professors, the students learning from them, spending their whole days around these EVIL people. I can't see them being any less evil than the other dictators in history responsible for the deaths of millions. And to think they live among us. And they want to make sure we suffer.  My heart rate went so up reading and watching twitter for a few minutes, just by accident. There are these thousands of people actually fighting to silence and throw us out of society where we all want to just continue living our lives as we've always done.  It's mental and I'm scared to see these people in 2 months when the university opens.</p></p>
