    <strong>Got only 1 real friend left | talk about Germany and where to leave</strong>
    <p><p>I guess thats the new normal today, going the way to desocialize as possible.<br>
You have no place in a world like  this. You cannot go against mainstream without getting judged, even if youre right. I noticed this since I was a kid that things like that never change. Now it's just very obvious and its getting taken advantage of by the big guys.<br>
When I was in 6th grade or so, I was in Physics class. We were speaking about electricity and Edison, so I was asking my teacher if he knows Nikola Tesla. He was like 40+ at that time and said he didnt know him and never heard about him.<br>
Then I said, but it was a very important scientist and engineer and should also be in the physics book. And he laughed at me, then because of this reaction the whole class laughed at me, and I was then bullied for about a few weeks. </p>
<p>Will never forget this terrible experience.</p>
<p>Right now I'm again experiencing the same. Got pretty unpopular for taking onto the Covid Propaganda and false vaccines. Not even a sign of somebody interested in hearing anything.<br>
From everyone I knew I had only 1 person that actually is my friend, as he listens when I talk and doesnt judge me for what I'm thinking. With that person I can talk stuff the whole day and we never had a fight. We are living in Germany and are both from Slavic countries and have some influence of communism and lived through this so called 'democracy'. <br>
If I talk to any german, forget it. I believe that these people are the easiest to bend and to do with them whatever someone wants to. They also live in some dream world and are easily getting offended. Even if you dont mean something offending, they would feel like that.<br>
And I think this is everywhere where people have an easy life, in rich countries. Those people just dont know what it feels like to have a bad life. They dont wanna imagine having one either or thinking about that. Also they are pretty much following every mainstream there is.<br>
Mainstream TV, Mainstream Music &amp; Movies, like you have no chance to succeed into anything that is not going their way. <br>
I experience that in their latest Soccer. Germany is only hyping up soccer because its the only sports they are good at. So recently they arent showing much of strength in the international games. The media and social media are spamming how the coach is aweful and should get the hell out of the team. But when he won the world cup a few years back, then he was the god.<br>
A really hypocrit country in my honest opinion. <br>
So you notice that if something isnt pleasant to hear or to watch, it gets automatically removed from the surface. </p>
<p>You cannot say your honest opinion and you dont hear honest opinions. You cannot share 'crazy' ideas nor you hear ideas because people are afraid to share any thoughts. People watch you with weirded out faces if you do something nice.  But if you do something bad for once they just wait to jump on you like hyenas. </p>
<p>And I honestly dont really feel good here anymore especially during this pandemic. <br>
I believe that some countries are handling this differently, and I'm looking into going to a country that isnt like this. Right now I feel like I wanna be somewhere, far away from brainwashing and propaganda. I wanna just live a normal life man, have fun, not worry about negative thoughts anymore. Where I can be myself without getting judged for what I am thinking. Where different minds can come together and find a solution for a problem, but right now this is just going away from a problem and thinking the solution is something the governments offer you.</p>
<p>I am really sad. I just want to smile again.</p></p>

        <p>I believe you are searching for the Truth, which is good. Without Truth, there is no meaning in this life.</p>
<p>I used to be a communist. My life was disordered. Truth restores order. Truth is the way to eternal life.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ is "the way and the truth and the life" (John 14:6). Walk with Him and you will walk in Truth. Walk with Him through the narrow gate.</p>
<p>We are sinners. We cannot save ourselves. We need God to save us. Pray for forgiveness, repent and put your trust in our Lord. </p>
<p>I will pray for you.</p>
<p>God bless you.</p>

<p>Without God, there are no "birthrights" for anything because everything would be subjective (moral relativism). </p>

        <p>Poland isn't too bad right now, no mask outside which makes a huge difference in the psychology, no segregation or health papers. You can go out and party if you want.

        <p>It's so interesting to hear you say this because I'm an expat living in Ireland and the bulk of the ppl that seem to see through this are my Slavic friends. The Irish have been fattened on decadence and luxury in recent decades, they've got a lot of trust and faith in their govts and they're willing to do anything they're told so they can get back to the pub and have a pint. </p>
<p>My friends from the eastern bloc have been skeptical since the beginning. You're definitely not alone</p>

        <p>Hey, tut mir leid das zu hören.</p>
<p>I just did my abitur last week (am 18 atm) and I know that german schools are a joke regarding political neutrality. Every second teacher is a part of the "Grünen". And I went to a gymnasium so that is allegedly the best possible education that germany can offer me. What a joke. School's literally trying to indoctrinate me here that was at least my experience through 12 years of it. The past 2 yaers have radically shrunk my friend crircle as well. I have relly only one real friend left now who coincidentally also originates from eastern europe. </p>
<p>My plan has always been leaving this country. Since my mother is originally from texas, I often dream of moving there. I fear that its going to get a lot worse in september here. </p>
<p>Wollte sonst auch nur sagen dass du in deiner Wahrnehmung nicht alleine bist, und dass auswandern meiner meinung nach eine sehr gute idee ist momentan. Ich denke die staaten gehen dafür, ansonsten fällt mir qllerdings auch nur osteuropa ein.</p>
