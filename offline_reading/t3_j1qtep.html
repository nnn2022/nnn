    <strong>Lockdown logic will cure traffic fatalities!</strong>
    <p><p>As we know hundreds of people are killed everyday due to traffic accidents so to fix that here's what we, your trusting and well intentioned government propose:</p>
<ol>
<li>Strict driving lockdown for at least the next 2 weeks, you're only allowed to do essential driving up to 2 miles away from your dwelling. We will also close all non-essential roads (don't worry how we determine this, we have your best interest in mind I assure you)</li>
<li>After we've successfully reduced deaths to an acceptable level (we'll change this depending on we feel that day) we will begin to slowly re-open.</li>
<li>In this first phase cars need to drive half the speed limit and can only drive on the essential roads we've designated. We don't care if you're a good driver, you could be a latent bad driver and you may not realize it for a week or two. We can't just have you driving around all willy nilly.</li>
<li>In phase 2 we'll re-open more roads but half the lanes are going to be shut down and you can't make left turns.</li>
<li>In phase 3 speed limits will be increased to 65% of normal speed and left turns will be ok again but you can not drive in any sort of group or convoy style, road trips are out of the question.</li>
<li>Once our undetermined amount of acceptable deaths is reached we'll slowly ramp back up to normal... if it's a good look for us politically of course.</li>
<li>Once we're back into the swing of things if traffic deaths get too high again we'll just do this whole process again until we eliminate all deaths on the road. Sure it's an inconvenience but it's a small price to pay to keep others well.</li>
</ol>
<p>Have a good day citizen and remember, stay safe :)</p></p>

        <p>You wouldn’t know that from the Melbourne shills on here saying that it’s not so bad there and everything they’re doing is helping to save people. I’m referring to the post about Australia obscuring suicide numbers.</p>

        <p>This is a false equivalency because traffic deaths and accidents are not communicable. Seeing, being near, or even being involved in a traffic accident (and surviving) doesn't cause you to become more prone to a future traffic death.</p>
<p>Despite this, the steps you listed actually WOULD decrease traffic deaths dramatically, just as lock downs have prevented an unabated spread of COVID. This would also KEEP traffic deaths down as it serves as a safety reset and for the population to adjust its behavior to follow traffic laws more strictly, just as adherence to mask wearing and hand washing would keep COVID infections down.</p>

        <p>That's what I'm saying, if we just take away peoples right and freedoms we can have dangers in nearly every aspect of life significantly reduced! To be honest rights and freedoms are overrated, just look the communist countries, they have some of the happiest and healthiest citizens in the world! All because the government is taking charge of their health and wellbeing (which is totally the governments right to do btw and if you argue against that you obviously don't care about anyone but yourself)</p>
<p>I honestly don't think we should even be asking the question if it's the right thing to do, if it's saving lives that's proof that it is morally the correct path.</p>

        <p>I'll start by saying driving is a privilege, not a right; another false equivalency. </p>
<p>Second, nowhere is it written that you have the right to not wear a mask, nor walk around pantsless, nor threaten the safety of your fellow citizens (quite the opposite, actually). Granted, it is also not written that you do NOT have these rights. Therefore, from a constitutional standpoint, it is up to the states to administer these rights. Mask mandates do not infringe on any federally protected rights under the constitution, and to claim so is a grossly extrapolated interpretation.</p>

        <p>Right I totally agree, if it's not written down under law it should totally be fair game, even if it's causes harm to someone. Morality only means as much as the government putting it down on a piece of paper, everyone knows that so these dumb anti-maskers should get on board already.</p>
<p>And totally agree with driving being a privilege, having your bare face is also a privilege and that's why it should be mandated to be covered. Just because you were born without a mask on your face doesn't mean you have the right to not wear one when you go about your business, it's insulting that people think they can just show their disgusting nose and mouth in public, it's absolutely deplorable.</p>
