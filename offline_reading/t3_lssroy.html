    <strong>Family and the plandemic</strong>
    <p><p>Had anyone had serious strain on their family relationships because of this mess? I started out pretty skeptical when covid all started, fell down the unfortunate rabbit hole and became doomer for a while and now have just recently woken back up...it is truly refreshing and eye-opening. I tried having a conversation with my sisters about the damage this is causing to society and what the long-term implications are of compliance to authoritarian government. I encouraged them to not wear masks whenever they can. </p>
<p>It seems as though it falls on deaf ears..I was name-called, shamed, and ignored. I was even accused of being mentally insane/on drugs. This hurts..it seems like something that would only be in the movies. I'm starting to think I'M the crazy one. How do you deal with this while keeping your marbles in check?</p></p>

        <p>Yep! My mom went from election virus hoax in summer to full on doomer somehow. Haven’t seen her in 4.5 months. Haven’t talked in 2 since arguments occurred because I wouldn’t participate in crazy land Christmas. </p>
<p>Christmas was wear masks at all times stay 6’ away, scheduled times to come visit (I think our time slot was 1-1:30, so couldn’t even see other family members as they had different time slots) must eat in another room with the door shut with the pre-made meals already on plates... madness. Told her I wasn’t coming because I refuse to treat family, or be treated, like a disease vector. I was indirectly called selfish.</p>

        <p>My sister is a doomer and I wouldn’t say it’s strained our relationship. We’ve always disagreed on politics so it was to be expected. At the end of the day we are all still family and aren’t gonna let politics get in the way of it. They shouldn’t be calling you all that stuff just because they disagree with you though, that’s not what family should do imo.</p>

        <p>Yup, my family drink the cult juice every time. Swine flu, I was the skeptic and called crazy because I didn’t follow the narrative. Same with Bird flu and both of those bullshit pandemics turned out to be massive cons... this is just the next cog in the wheel.</p>
<p>It’s not easy to keep your marbles when all around you seem to have lost theirs, especially when we have fear porn put in front of our eyes and ears 24/7. A complicit media and social media are just as guilty, if not more so!
I think the past year has proved two things, education and critical thinking are severely lacking in schools these days and seriously needs to be addressed as we seem to be now a society governed by emotionally unstable and seemingly morally blind sociopaths.
Secondly we as a species are not evolved enough to use platforms such as social media (Facebook, twatter, IG) for the proper reasons they should be used, all social media has done since its inception is shine a light on the worst that humanity has to offer and given a very loud microphone to those who espouse fucking ridiculous ideas and ideologies. Get rid of social media in all its forms and watch as the mental health of people from 6-60 improve vastly!</p>

        <p>Fortunately no. My immediate family sees the bullshit and they're tired of being preached to. I'm very grateful that they can think for themselves.</p>

        <p>Fortunately I am in the same boat. Everyone one in my immediate family knows it’s all bullshit. My Dad has been predicting something like this for the past several years. We used to tease him about being a conspiracy theorist and that he should wear a tinfoil hat. (It was done with love. That’s just our family) but after I had kids something in my husband and I kind of woke up and we stared actually listening to him more. All I got to say several years ago we would never have thought his predictions would be so accurate.</p>
