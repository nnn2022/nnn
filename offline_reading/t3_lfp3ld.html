    <strong>Can anybody let me in on the truth about COVID?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m wondering what the transmission rates are for this virus. The main reason I’m asking is because one of my friends tested positive today and I was hanging out with him for a good bit earlier. I’m very new to this sub btw.</p>
<p>EDIT: I’m not so much worried about me catching it but more so my parents who are in their mid 50s early 60s. But I really appreciate the replies!</p></p>

        <p>Tests are notoriously unreliable.  Elon Musk tested positive twice and negative twice in the same day.  Coke, kiwi fruit, and even an unused swab have all tested positive.  A positive test means nothing.  If your friend is symptomless, you should have nothing to worry about</p>

        <p>There used to be a site that had the transmission rates by state, but that got taken down when it showed that the mask Nazi states had higher transmission rates. </p>
<p>In general, the Rt number for covid in the US was hanging around 1.1 overall. That means each person with the virus was infecting 1.1 other people. States like Florida and South Dakota were under .9, which means the spread was slowing. </p>
<p>That website now directs to a site that only shows new case and death numbers, which do nighting but scare uniformed people.</p>

        <p>No one knows what the 'transmission rates' are. They don't know for definite if asymptomatic people transmit covid. All studies point to... probably not. But no one knows the answer. If ur pal was ill and showed signs of covid, chances are u may catch it. If he didnt you wont. Either way. Unless you are REALLY obese, REALLY old or have some other REALLY bad underlying symptoms, you will be fine. Try not to panic as you will then get into a never ending circle of panic because most symptoms of stress/anxiety/panic.... you guessed it, are signs of covid. Theres like 30 of them.</p>
<p>Take care and welcome.</p>

        <p>If I may,  looking at transmission rates to determine your risk is kind of like using the US census to figure your odds of being Lithuanian.  Best to look closer to home. </p>
<p>Regardless of what anyone in the thread says, you'll know in a few days.  Don't french kiss anyone in that period. </p>
<p>You know better than anyone will be able to tell you.  Did you have sex?  Did you watch TV?  Did you engage in Greco-Roman wrestling? </p>
<p>If you are worried though, just chill out.  As I said, you'll soon know. As a redittor, you are statistically probably under 40 years old, so you have very little to fear.  Just try not to give it to anyone else until you know you are good.  That's just good manners.</p>

        <p>I'll give you life experience data.  </p>
<p>2 days before two ladies at work came down with it I was hanging out in their office which is approximately 7' x 7'.  None of us wore masks.  I got a nice little 3 day vacation while I got tested.  Nope.  Never ran a fever or any other symptom.  That said I did distance myself from my elderly parents for a period of six days just in case.  Nope.  Then I got the flu.  Not COVID.  I took the little test again.  Negative.  Got 10 days off for that one because it kicked my ass. Had to get tested again to get cleared for work.  Negative again. Dad got it and it kicked his ass for a month (he's 82).  The it ran around the neighborhood.  It was nasty for a while.  Everybody got tested.  Nope.  My wife and my mom.  Never developed a symptom.</p>
<p>Even if it WAS COVID and all my neighbors are 60+ not one person died.  So if it was and all the tests were wrong it's not near as deadly or communicable as people think. If it was a simple flu then that hasn't been eradicated as much as the 'data' show now has it?  </p>
<p>LOL this whole thing is a farce</p>

        <p>There are viruses. They are not contagious. You can't catch them and they don't make you sick. You can't make anyone sick and No
One can make you sick. COVID is a common cold/flu. Your body's cells clean and purge toxins and the results of this cleaning is an exosome/virus.. Your body is making trillions of viruses all the time. Your parents will get sick and and they will not feel well seasonally -when our bodies are triggered to purge toxins - which result in cold and flu like symptoms.  You cannot make your parents sick unless you cause them stress and worry and strain and trauma. This is the only way you can be directly connected to any sickness they may have. https://questioningcovid.com</p>

        <p>Just to add.  A few COVID virus particles will not give you the disease.  Most healthy peoples bodies can fight off a few virus particles.  It's proportional to how many virus particles get in and your immune system has to go into overdrive to get rid of them which causes the 'sickness feeling' or so I've read but I could be mistaken.  Anybody with a better knowledge of virology want to correct me and / or clear that up?</p>
