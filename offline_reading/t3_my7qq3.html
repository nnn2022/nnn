    <strong>When someone is angry that your not wearing a mask...</strong>
    <p><p>In my own experience I have found that if someone is mad that your not wearing a mask or don‚Äôt like wearing masks it seems like they are more mad that your not complying and being obedient rather than fearing for their own safety. This shows me how easily people have been brainwashed. These same people will get in your face for not wearing a mask. What a silly thing for someone to do if this really is an extremely dangerous virus in their minds. If the whole point is to ‚Äústop the spread‚Äù of the virus wouldn‚Äôt you as a mask wearer want to keep your distance from me? Covid has never scared me, but the response to covid certainly has.</p></p>

However, cloth face coverings are not personal protective equipment (PPE) and should not be used instead of a respirator or a facemask to protect a healthcare worker.</a></p>

Compared with wearing no mask, wearing a mask may make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like illness (9 studies; 3507 people); and probably makes no difference in how many people have flu confirmed by a laboratory test (6 studies; 3005 people). Unwanted effects were rarely reported, but included discomfort.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/farce-mask-its-safe-for-only-20-minutes-20030427-gdgnyo.html">"Those masks are only effective so long as they are dry," said Professor Yvonne Cossart of the Department of Infectious Diseases at the University of Sydney. "As soon as they become saturated with the moisture in your breath they stop doing their job and pass on the droplets." Professor Cossart said that could take as little as 15 or 20 minutes, after which the mask would need to be changed. But those warnings haven't stopped people snapping up the masks, with retailers reporting they are having trouble keeping up with demand.</a></p>

<p>And here is research from the CDC.</p>
<p>"Disposable medical masks (also known as surgical masks) are loose-fitting devices that were designed to be worn by medical personnel to protect accidental contamination of patient wounds, and to protect the wearer against splashes or sprays of bodily fluids. There is limited evidence for their effectiveness in preventing influenza virus transmission either when worn by the infected person for source control or when worn by uninfected persons to reduce exposure. Our systematic review found no significant effect of face masks on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza."
https://archive.is/y22jF</p>
<p>"More research on cloth masks is needed to inform their use as an alternative to surgical masks/respirators in the event of shortage or high-demand situations. To our knowledge, only 1 randomized controlled trial has been conducted to examine the efficacy of cloth masks in healthcare settings, and the results do not favor use of cloth masks."

"There is no specific evidence to suggest that the wearing of masks by the mass population has any potential benefit.

<p>New England Journal of Medicine, 2nd paragraph¬†
"We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection. Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes). The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal. In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic."</p>

<p>BMJ
The rates of all infection outcomes were highest in the cloth mask arm, with the rate of ILI statistically significantly higher in the cloth mask arm (relative risk (RR)=13.00, 95% CI 1.69 to 100.07) compared with the medical mask arm. Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%.
This study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution against the use of cloth masks.¬†

"We do not recommend requiring the general public who do not have symptoms of COVID-19-like illness to routinely wear cloth or surgical masks because:
There is no scientific evidence they are effective in reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission
Their use may result in those wearing the masks to relax other distancing efforts because they have a sense of protection
We need to preserve the supply of surgical masks for at-risk healthcare workers.
Sweeping mask recommendations‚Äîas many have proposed‚Äîwill not reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, as evidenced by the widespread practice of wearing such masks in Hubei province, China, before and during its mass COVID-19 transmission experience earlier this year. Our review of relevant studies indicates that cloth masks will be ineffective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, whether worn as source control or as PPE."

<p>‚ÄúBecause we had cases we thought were pertussis and because we had vulnerable patients at the hospital, we lowered our threshold,‚Äù she said. Anyone who had a cough got a P.C.R. test, and so did anyone with a runny nose who worked with high-risk patients like infants.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how we ended up with 134 suspect cases,‚Äù Dr. Kirkland said. And that, she added, was why 1,445 health care workers ended up taking antibiotics and 4,524 health care workers at the hospital, or 72 percent of all the health care workers there, were immunized against whooping cough in a matter of days."</p>

        <p>I don‚Äôt really agree. In the beginning of the pandemic I would be annoyed having unmasked people around me because the science wasn‚Äôt in yet. So why not take any easy precaution. Just seems ignorant. </p>
<p>Now that it‚Äôs came out masks don‚Äôt shit, I stopped wearing one too. I‚Äôm legit just going by the science. </p>
<p>The fact is a lot of anti maskers are just right about this by accident. They genuinely don‚Äôt care about their health in other aspects and if this actually was serious (and hell for many obese and old anti maskers it is) they would die.</p>

        <p>One of the most vocal people I‚Äôve been following about this pandemic (followed him since before) is a fitness influencer. While I can‚Äôt say he represents the cumulative whole of mask skeptics, he‚Äôs posted a lot of information and studies, as well as encouraging others to eat right and stay fit, which many mask skeptics believe. Compare that to pro-maskers who currently live sedentary lifestyles indoors and ordering unhealthy foods online as opposed to making your own leaner meals. It‚Äôs odd to say that people who would rather not wear a mask ‚Äúgenuinely don‚Äôt care about their health‚Äù when this is a very common trend between the two right now.</p>
