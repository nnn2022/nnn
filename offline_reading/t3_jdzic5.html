<p>https://www.news-medical.net/news/20200701/SARS-CoV-2-circulating-in-Brazil-back-in-November-2019.aspx</p>
<p>All around the globe. Asia, South America, Europe. With how many visitors the US gets it would be absolutely stupid not to assume that it wasn't here all the way back then.</p>
<p>Brings up the question: when did the virus first arise? It must have infected a massive amount of people to have already been all over the place in Nov/Dec. Could it have come up in October of 2019? Or September? Maybe earlier?</p>
<p>Anyway, we didn't care or shut down until March. A full 4-5 months later. 4-5 months it was spreading around as life basically went on normally, with none of the ridiculous measures we have now. All of a sudden in February China started making noise and posting ridiculous footage of people falling over in the streets, body bags, etc. Scare tactics to warm us up. Then Italy was the first to fall, the crucial domino. Whenever friends show me their vacation photos in Italy from December or January I always point out that there is a high chance you encountered the virus there.</p>
<p>None of the shit that happened in China happened anywhere else. Even the scary footage coming from Italy was always reused and only localized to specific areas. Yet we were fooled into thinking it was the next black death. For months it spread, unhindered, in winter conditions ideal for respiratory viruses and the apocalypse never came.</p>
<p>So when November rolls around, remember that the virus has been around for a year at the minumum. Remind people that it didn't suddenly burst into existence in March. We were fine back then and we will be now.</p></p>

        <p>I remember arguing with one of the earliest doomers on the coronavirus sub. He was insisting if we didn't follow China's lead and put an armed guard outside everyone's home authorized to gun us down if we leave, there would be people dying in the streets and it would be the end of the world.</p>
<p>Oh how I wish this sub existed back then.</p>

        <p>The entire problem is that we believed China when we shouldn't have. An authoritarian, genocidal government with a historical precedent of lying, obscuring facts and a vested interest in destabilizing economic rivals. How did we not think this through? How could we have been so stupid?</p>
<p>We STILL believe their lies! We believe them when they say they have 82k cases only. They're throwing pool parties, they're not shut down. What they're doing is laughing. At us.</p>

        <p>The number of people blaming Trump for the virus instead of China tells us how effective their propaganda machine is too, or rather, how foolish so many of us are. All the closet communists are coming out too.</p>
<p>I've said it several times on Reddit and elsewhere. We need to set up a citizenship exchange program with China. All the people who hate the US and think it's awful can exchange citizenships with a Hong Kong citizen who is discontent with the CCP. Everyone wins.</p>

        <p>Very interesting post, I’m in Melbourne and we get a HUGE amount of Chinese coming and going, 1.4 million a year from memory, there is no way it wasn’t circulating earlier than the over-reaction and ‘official’ timeline of events, I honestly think everything would be as usual if there was never mass testing and panic, those videos from China caused a LOT of panic and fear here</p>

        <p>This point gets zero coverage on the news. Don't forget, we also had the Super Bowl during this. The ultimate "super spreader" event. But did we hear anything from it? Nov-March is proof that the world can be blind to the existence of the virus and things would not seem any different.</p>

        <p>I'm familiar with it. What about it? And how does it refute anything in my post? Exponential growth has a ceiling and can't go on forever, the early models were terrible and assumed everyone was going to come into contact with everyone else when that's blatantly false. Besides, if it was already at the level of exponential growth then nothing could have stopped it and locking down certainly wouldn't have and didn't.</p>
