        <p>This was the most compelling article I‚Äôve yet seen re: the lab-leak origin theory. The major potential knock against it is the chance this author is a US spook mouthpiece and so can‚Äôt be trusted (possible, but not certain).</p>
<p>I do wonder what kind of crossover there is between the ‚Äúcoronavirus is nbd and any containment measures are overkill and pointless‚Äù contingent and the ‚Äúlab leak/potential bioweapon and/or engineered virus‚Äù clan</p>

        <p>&rt;After consultations with experts, some U.S. officials came to believe this Beijing lab was likely conducting coronavirus experiments on mice fitted with ACE2 receptors well before the coronavirus outbreak‚Äîresearch they hadn‚Äôt disclosed and continued not to admit to.</p>
<p>I found this sentence in the article rather puzzling, because <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3985"> WIV scientists were co-authors on a 2015 research paper about exactly this kind of experiment</a>. As it happens, the experiment succeeded in creating completely new coronaviruses that were capable of infecting human cells.</p>
<p>Strange how the media doesn't talk about this very often.</p>
<p>&rt;I do wonder what kind of crossover there is between the ‚Äúcoronavirus is nbd and any containment measures are overkill and pointless‚Äù contingent and the ‚Äúlab leak/potential bioweapon and/or engineered virus‚Äù clan</p>
<p>The crossover will be tin foil hat people who are prepared to disbelieve whatever the authorities tell them because they have a kneejerk distrust of societal authorities.</p>
<p>I get that coronavirus isn't even that dangerous for most people, but I think the complete failure of our government to deal with it in a coordinated or sensible manner is a warning for just how vulnerable we are to any future bioweapon. Every terrorist and hostile state actor in the world knows where our vulnerabilities are now, and the people complaining about mask mandates aren't thinking ahead.</p>
<p>People get bogged down in arguing over whether surgical masks are effective when they should be asking why we <em>still</em> have a n95 shortage over a year later. </p>
<p>I were CCP leadership I would be monitoring the situation closely, and probably would want to contribute to the misinformation campaign. I think the CCP probably has an interest in maintaining an anti-mask community in the West so that when the real bioweapon gets released it will spread like wildfire.</p>

        <p>Ya I‚Äôm with you on all this. The institutional failures have been absurd to watch unfold and repeat themselves cyclically during the last year. It will be sick irony if certain Western (and Brazilian) breeds of denialism about the seriousness of the outbreak end up producing variants more akin to the severity many thought covid capable of initially, approaching the OG SARS itself. Hopefully this isn‚Äôt already happening.</p>
<p>One year later and n95s are still hard to come by, at home OTC tests are still not available, and the widespread adoption of masking during a respiratory viral outbreak (a tactic Asian countries figured out 20 years ago) is still somehow a debatable topic in the US and Europe. We‚Äôve learned nothing.</p>
<p>And when a more serious pandemic comes, these failures and ‚Äúdebates‚Äù will definitely repeat.</p>
