    <strong>Hope everyone learned to have a well stocked pantry after all this craziness.</strong>
    <p><p>The whole covid thing proved that once people start to freak out because the media told them to that our supply chain can not keep up.  </p>
<p>This pandemic has proven that having a well stocked pantry and keeping plenty of non perishable food is a very wise decision. You never know when the media will start hyping up a new variant and store shelves will then be bare again.  </p>
<p>Also unless you are a very generous person, DON'T tell everyone that you have plenty of food set away unless you want everyone demanding a handout.</p></p>

        <p>Of course ! The great reset is surely coming </p>
<p>You should read on Albert Pike’s take (ive been told it isn’t real but the letter does point out a very good point the elite want)</p>
<p>The great reset is 100% tied to the luciferian new world order</p>

        <p>Just to add in and keep in mind I work in a mid sized high volume store in the middle of nowhere TX.</p>
<p>We get a grocery truck delivery every other day.  Perishible and produce every other day.  The pharmacy has a delivery every other day.  If the supply chain stopped my store would be completely out of edible food in a week.  There would be very few drugs in the pharmacy.  </p>
<p>Yall ever watch a run on stores when a hurricane is coming?  Imagine that with every canned good, noodle, etc, that can be stored for a while.  It's literally that close every day you live.  </p>
<p>OP is right and my family and I do keep a couple months worth of non perishible food around just for the eventuality of something going South.  </p>
<p>I lived through the great toilet paper rush at the onset of this nonsense.  I could completely fill the shelves and that's 8 4' wide sections before the store opened at 7:00 am.  By 7:15 to 7:20 it was totally gone.  Now imagine that across the entire store?  Even limiting people to 2 items of this and that didn't stop people.  I saw couples coming in and doubling up on everything.  </p>
<p>The good news is I was never out of toilet paper, neither was my family , and friends of ours in the neighborhood.  LOL</p>
