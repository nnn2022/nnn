    <strong>20 Things I've Learned (Or Had Confirmed) About Humanity During The 'Pandemic'</strong>
    <p><p>Thought you would appreciate this. Original is written by Zuby, can't take credit, but I do agree with all of them.</p>
<p><strong>20 Things I've Learned (Or Had Confirmed) About Humanity During The 'Pandemic' :</strong></p>
<p><strong>1/</strong> Most people would rather be in the majority, than be right.</p>
<p><strong>2/</strong> At least 20% of the population has strong authoritarian tendencies, which will emerge under the right conditions.</p>
<p><strong>3/</strong> Fear of death is only rivalled by the fear of social disapproval. The latter could be stronger.</p>
<p><strong>4/</strong> Propaganda is just as effective in the modern day as it was 100 years ago. Access to limitless information has not made the average person any wiser.</p>
<p><strong>5/</strong> Anything and everything can and will be politicised by the media, government, and those who trust them.</p>
<p><strong>6/</strong> Many politicians and large corporations will gladly sacrifice human lives if it is conducive to their political and financial aspirations.</p>
<p><strong>7/</strong> Most people believe the government acts in the best interests of the people. Even many who are vocal critics of the government.</p>
<p><strong>8/</strong> Once they have made up their mind, most people would rather to commit to being wrong, than admit they were wrong.</p>
<p><strong>9/</strong> Humans can be trained and conditioned quickly and relatively easily to significantly alter their behaviours - for better or worse.</p>
<p><strong>10/</strong> When sufficiently frightened, most people will not only accept authoritarianism, but demand it.</p>
<p><strong>11/</strong> People who are dismissed as 'conspiracy theorists' are often well researched and simply ahead of the mainstream narrative.</p>
<p><strong>12/</strong> Most people value safety and security more than freedom and liberty, even if said 'safety' is merely an illusion</p>
<p><strong>13/</strong> Hedonic adaptation occurs in both directions, and once inertia sets in, it is difficult to get people back to 'normal'.</p>
<p><strong>14/</strong> A significant % of people thoroughly enjoy being subjugated.</p>
<p><strong>15/</strong> 'The Science' has evolved into a secular pseudo-religion for millions of people in the West. This religion has little to do with science itself.</p>
<p><strong>16/</strong> Most people care more about looking like they are doing the right thing, rather than actually doing the right thing.</p>
<p><strong>17/</strong> Politics, the media, science, and the healthcare industries are all corrupt, to varying degrees. Scientists and doctors can be bought as easily as politicians.</p>
<p><strong>18/</strong> If you make people comfortable enough, they will not revolt. You can keep millions docile as you strip their rights, by giving them money, food, and entertainment.</p>
<p><strong>19/</strong> Modern people are overly complacent and lack vigilance when it comes to defending their own freedoms from government overreach.</p>
<p><strong>20/</strong> It's easier to fool a person than to convince them that they have been fooled.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah man I feel you.</p>
<p>But least we have knowledge to arm ourselves with. We will be able to get ahead and build our Arc. </p>
<p>So when the flood gets bad and shit hits the fan we will be okay. Most others will be scrambling..</p>
