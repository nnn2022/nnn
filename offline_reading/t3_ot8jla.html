    <strong>It's time to get on the front foot.</strong>
    <p><p>The mask has slipped. What once could of been considered genuine compassion has revealed itself under pressure to be the true feeling of the covid believer:</p>
<p>We hate you enough to see you die if you don't take the vaccine we require you take.</p>
<p>Why would we take it now? You realise the soft cunts that would say that, would fall to water if you said that to them? We're not the ones operating in emotion here, they are. </p>
<p>I'm asking people to start throwing these vile cunts language back in there face where it belongs. Let's face it: they hate us. They have been conditioned to believe we are their enemy. We are not, we are their family, their friends, their co-workers.</p>
<p>You need to shout back unfortunately, you are right, you are angry, at least you should be. You should see the destruction of humanity completely unless you get through to these people that this will not end with their compliance, or all of ours.</p>
<p>We can't afford to wait for these fucking idiots to realise how wrong they have it. It's up to you to intervene. In a strange inversion, they seem to think they are the ones saving us, when it's the other way around. </p>
<p>Up until now, I'd say they thought they had moral authority, and you know what, maybe they did, but now that their at peak anger, they think youre going to die and are more than happy to watch it.</p>
<p>Not everyone is at this stage yet, only really hyperbolic Twitter freaks and Reddit science legends are coming to this, your average mask wearer won't exactly be thinking that, but smash the normies with it though, "you want me dead cunt? Is this really how it is? Because if so were done, completely."</p>
<p>Be devisive, draw the line, they already have, the more people that make it clear to every dumb fuck believing it, the more it makes them think about it, I'm planning on smashing each and every family member with this.</p>
<p>Face it, what else are we going to do? Passively accept? If we know our demise is certain, why would we not be a stick in the mud, doing exactly the opposite of what we know everyone involved in this wants us to do.</p>
<p>At the very least, it will galvanize you as an individual, and stand you in good stead moving into some exciting times, I think we can all agree lol.</p></p>

        <p>It is next to impossible to change thier opinion during a single conversation. I think we need to slowly plant seeds of dissent. </p>
<p>Point out the inversion before it happens. Fauci said the vaxx doesn't stop spread. So then vaxx passports are pointless. </p>
<p>Hopefully when the inversion happens the seeds of dissent you have planted will flourish.</p>

        <p>No it is. They are used to strong direct language. When it involves those that they are supposed to be caring about and setting boundaries, they listen. The question is are you willing to lose these people if they go? Do you still want to be around them after?</p>

        <p>Throwing anger back at them just sows more division, sows hostility, and will eventually lead to unnecessary physical confrontation.</p>
<p>In my job, I deal with angry, beligerant customers akin to what you'd find in a deeply religious branch covidian. You cannot reason with them. Throwing facts just escalates things.</p>
<p>The best approach is a mixing of treating  them like simple minded children and/or killing them with kindness. This disarms them because they expect pushback. </p>
<p>Literally laugh and infantilize them like you would a 6 year old trying to fight you over something they dont understand.</p>
<p>ex: <em>doomer screeching</em></p>
<p>You: <em>hearty chuckle</em> "I was once like you, looking at the govt data really clears this up. I hope one day you can learn to read data. Take care friend" and walk away chuckling.</p>

        <p>You think I'm walking away chuckling? I agree with you, reducing their argument to that of a childs and laughing at it works too. I'm not out to own people, I've made that clear too. This is not some debate, this is to be taken seriously and treated as such.</p>

        <p>The way you are taking it seriously doesnt match up to how they are taking it seriously. </p>
<p>Again, you are wasting your time. These people revolve on an entirely emotional level. </p>

        <p>Nah I think it is. If this is meant to be their armageddon then this could be considered ours. Theirs is fleeting, pathetic, and pulled strings by someone else by that's why they need to be snapped out of immediately before they do harm to themselves if they havent already.</p>
<p>I stated that. These people are emotional. You cannot reason with them. The idea is to appeal to emotion and imply drastic consequences, effectively the same thing that has happened to them already. Worked once right? </p>
<p>Wasting my time? What time do we have left? I'd rather start a cause and effect chain now than later. Harder the better, the more that do it the better.</p>

        <p>The only answer i have is what not to do. More division is not the answer, we need to keep our cool. They are putting out "un-v'd are creating mutants" type stuff to sow animosity towards us. If we throw it back, it just discredits us as unhinged lunatics. </p>

        <p>Not familiar with reference, but I know this will be hard to do, and I think people should start taking pleasure in doing it. You won't get the chance to beat them in the ring, only mentally, so start. You will be vindicated for it at a level only you will understand.</p>

From a Star Trek the next Gen episode, everyone starts falling to this mind device that plays a holographic game in front of your eyes and when you when it triggers the pleasure center of the brain and the whole crew is turning into mind numb automatons of course there’s a bigger plot behind it but there’s a few resisting it and that’s how I feel right how</p>

        <p>I used to think so. They want you dead if you don't get it though. This is disgusting and I hate saying it but what else are you meant to do?</p>

If I were you, just a suggestion, I would not advocate any type of violence.</p>

        <p>I'm not advocating for any type of violence, I'm advocating for a specific type of interaction. I don't want violence, this is what we are avoiding on a mass scale long term. I'm trying to avoid that by making the speech hard, against those it will effect. This is not a blanket strategy. As I said in the post people are at various levels, I trust the people here to use it selectively.</p>
