        <p>What is wrong with it being the only option? If you cannot find a way to 'be productive' at home, I doubt you will find a way to be that 'at work'.</p>

        <p>Vast majority of people do some sort of physical work, you know, and the only thing you can realistically do from your couch is basic office work and coding. Now, if you can make that choice, good for you, but if not, vast majority of the society is fucked. Somebody needs to manufacture stuff you need, somebody needs to grow food you eat, somebody needs to fix your shit.... How old are you?...</p>

        <p>It’s important to me to keep work and home spaces separated. I think the worst thing is like, seeing your boss’ bedroom, or having people’s kids all over the screen. </p>
<p>I don’t mind having pics of your kids plastered all over the office or you telling us what a hot wife you have or whatever is acceptable in different workplaces- but for me my privacy is personally really important and also, I feel much more focused when I’m in a space where everyone there has the same goals. I just don’t want that line to start blurring, because People (and sometimes I’ve noticed I’m the person!) tend to start thinking they know you MUCH more closely than coworkers and that’s not the case.</p>

        <p>Well, it can be really difficult. My mum started a new job back in November, and she's been really struggling. She's not gotten to meet her colleagues in person, she's been trained on teams and basically she's sitting at home all day dealing with complaints and phone calls. It's not doing her mental health any good. For people like her, she needs work and home to be separate, she needs to be on her feet and go somewhere for work and she needs to see the people she's working with. As well as this, people who are working from home often aren't answering calls or emails so you sit around waiting for a week to get a response.</p>

        <p>Completely agree this is the only thing I have enjoyed during this bullshit. I work for a major corporate healthcare company, which I do not owe any loyalty, and never needed to actually do work for much more than a few hours a day when in the office like most cube jobs. There is no need for me to be in the office wasting away mentally and physically. I hope I never have to go back.</p>

        <p>People that think work from home is a good thing do not have even a basic understanding of economics.</p>
<p>Simply put - if you can do your work from home, then anyone in the world can do it.</p>
<p>In the old normal, jobs were limited to people within driving distance to the job. (Or people willing to relocate for the job.)</p>
<p>In the new Work From Home normal, you will (eventually) compete with workers from all over the world for the same positions.</p>
<p>Just ask an American factory worker how well that worked out for them, when they faced global wage competition. They're easy to find, just look for any old guy on a street corner or in your local tent city.</p>
<p>But I know. You're <em>different</em>. You could <em>never</em> be outsourced.</p>

        <p>No, it's not. For some jobs it's very difficult, and for some people they find it hard and bad for their mental health though. So I think it'd do well to be an option, but not forced.</p>
