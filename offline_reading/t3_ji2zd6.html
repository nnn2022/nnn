    <strong>Tasked to enforce the new normal</strong>
    <p><p>I am law enforcement officer in a Canadian city. Throwaway account for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>As a preamble my views are my own and do not represent my department and I will still (reluctantly) be following all orders and policies. </p>
<p>When I swore my oath we were told there were laws we would have to enforce that we would not agree with. I never imagined the implications of that moral conundrum in 2020 enforcing the “new normal”</p>
<p>Canada is an extremely liberal country. You can be caught committing multiple gun offences in a year and get free bail. The requirement for us to search, seize evidence and prosecute people for crimes are usually extremely stringent.</p>
<p>In areas of the province of Quebec, gatherings of anyone from other households are now forbidden due to covid. Judges can provide a warrant for police to forcibly enter a private home if an illegal gathering is suspected - yes, the very act of inviting your own biological mother to sit at the table with her and have a coffee in your home is ILLEGAL. It is illegal and an armed agent of the state can break down your door for this illegal act. This feels dystopian. like a bad sci-fi movie. Dancing, singing, gathering, having a religious function and working out are now declared “illegal”. Meanwhile violent crime is increasing and actual criminals continue to operate with impunity. </p>
<p>I work in an area with numerous homeless shelters everyday, these are hundreds of some of the most unhygienic, malnourished people in the country. Literally sharing needles, never shower and in close proximity all day. I have yet to become aware of one single covid death. </p>
<p>I attend all city hospitals in any given month which appear to be operating completely normally. The alarmist language used by our health officials would have you believe there are beds in the hallway and bodies piling up. </p>
<p>What have I seen? - mental health and drug issues skyrocketing. Crime is up. FEAR everywhere. Businesses are closing and boarded up. Streets are deserted and depressing. None of these metrics and stats appear to play any role in governments decisions.</p>
<p>These experiences are anecdotal. Still, the statistics in Canada are about 8,500 died from flu/pneumonia in 2019, we are sitting at the mid 9,000s for covid. (marginally higher) and the vast majority are in long term care homes for people at the end of their lives. We have less than one single covid patient for each hospital in our province. We have shattered every best case scenario “modeling” to the point it’s comical. If I didn’t have a TV I wouldn’t know there was a pandemic. We accept thousands more deaths and hospitalizations as a society from alcohol, smoking and obesity that are completely avoidable and non-essential without any government intervention. </p>
<p>On a positive note; excluding command staff (which by nature are political and pro-lockdown enforcement) I would say well over 50% of frontline street law enforcement share many of the views and concerns of this subreddit. It’s been a rough year for law enforcement, please know that many of us stand with you in your concerns. We aren’t able to publicly show it. People are waking up. We all need to express rationale objection to this to influence public policy.</p></p>

<p>I think that anyone with a functioning brain can see that this is either the most colossal policy fuck up in the history of the world, or there's something truly sinister at play here. It's good to know that the majority of cops have functioning brains. We need you guys on the side of righteousness if we are to stand a chance. This is only the beginning.</p>

<p>It has to be orchestrated. Humanity can't be this stupid and have made it to this point to be this stupid after having survived not being this stupid to get to this point, lol. It doesn't add up at all. It's like a NASCAR driver suddenly being unable to not hit everything while driving the speed limit on a regular road. Does not add up, Batman.</p>

        <p>Oh not doubting the mass levels if hysteria my point is it's like a controlled demolition; there's always bumper lanes in place and it's never the top that suffers just the base/bottom of the social pyramid.</p>
<p>It goes both ways; at what point WOULDN'T a sociopath take advantage of that, and why wouldn't that personality type gravitate towards positions of power like water to a hole in your roof...?</p>

        <p>These protective measures are the reason why Covid cases are so low. Are you that daft to think there’s no correlation between the “extreme” measures and low cases?? Meanwhile the US refuses to shut down and has seen hundreds of thousands of deaths. The fact that the majority are in nursing homes does not make these deaths irrelevant. These are human lives you’re talking about. They are somebody’s mother, father, grandma, or grandpa. They matter whether or not you think they do.</p>

        <p>You have found yourself in an echo chamber of superstition, and from what I gather from viewing multiple posts, a lack of understanding of statistics.</p>
<p>What people here don't get is that if liberal or populist, or even dictatorships, that almost all countries are putting in measures. That leaves two options, either a pandemic, a natural disaster that has happened multible times in human history, of a new virus, that spreads without symptoms and damages/kills its victims, that has an infection rate of 4 per person is ravaging the world; or all countries are ruled by some super organisation that controls everything and is trying to hijack the world. </p>
<p>The fact that people would rather believe the latter here shows that there is no hope for them.</p>
<p>Them complaining about the effectiveness of measures is perfectly okay, but to couple it with a completely lack of understanding devalues it fully.</p>

        <p>How many cops do you personally know? I’m not being facetious. I’m genuinely asking - I’m a cop. Most of my family are cops. I can promise you we are most certainly on the side of the people. Because we are also people. And we live among the people we work for.</p>
<p>I can’t imagine how much harder my life would be if I were to conduct myself as a robotic arbiter of the state. I’ve had to arrest friends I grew up playing in the neighborhood with. It sucks and it makes you feel like shit. But guess what - we’re still friends because I was fair, I’m not a power tripping dickhead and they knew they fucked up. I ran into a dude I locked up at a bar once. I thought he was eyefucking me and getting ready to start some shit. He bought me a beer and shook my hand for being respectful to him. I think my state’s governor is a tyrannical, cocksucking piece of shit. I told a chief on my job back in April that if orders came down for us to enforce mask and social distance bullshit I’d call in sick for as long as I could get away with it and then I’d take my suspension with my head held high. And he was cool with it. Because he’s a person too that also lives among the people.</p>
<p>I am not too naive to know nor am I blind to the videos of mostly Australian, German and British police going nuts on this COVID bullshit. Maybe if push comes to shove I will be greatly disappointed on who’s side a lot of my colleagues find themselves on. All I can say for sure is that there are at least a few cops on your side.</p>

        <p>My cousin is a security guard in the UK, but  honestly I don’t know a lot of cops personally. I’ve seen videos of sheriffs and cops saying they won’t enforce COVID restrictions. However I’ve seen many many more of cops bluntly enforcing them, as you would say going on a power trip. I would assume then that the majority of cops will do as they’re told regardless of what rights they may trample on, although I’m certain there’s a minority who won’t. If not enough cops are on our side it won’t matter in the end, there has to be a significant amount of civil disobedience.</p>

        <p>Things will either get better on their own or they won’t. If they don’t get better on their own then the only alternative is for things to get bad enough for everyone to be forced to pick a side - fight for the ability of the state to rule over us as subjects or fight for individual rights and freedom. If that happens (and I pray with everything I have that it won’t) then we will see immense bravery and extreme cowardice on both sides. Only time will tell and bravery/cowardice are things you only find out about yourself in the moment when faced with life-altering decisions.</p>

        <p>Yeah cops work for the state they are the attack dogs. But if they stop performing that role then the rulers have no way to control us and no way to protect them. Unfortunately 99.99% of the time they “just follow orders” The military though has been seen to revolt in cases such as WW1 Russia.</p>

        <p>Law enforcement officers here in the US took an oath to uphold the constitution. Sadly, I'm seeing too many of them doing whatever the people above them tell them to do, even when it is clearly unconstitutional. I would walk away from the job before I ever did something that infringed upon someone's civil liberties, something that was unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Don't the officers, who are doing what they know is wrong, the ones carrying out orders being dictated by someone above them with an agenda, ever think about what its like to be on the other side? How would you guys feel if you were the one being subjected to the behavior? That's what I want to understand. Cops have kids. They have families. They're fucking american, or whatever. Why do so many of them continue doing these kinds of things? I don't get it.</p>

<p>LOL They should be resigning in droves then. Fat chance. The police as an institution is beyond repair in the US and needs to be torn down and completely de-funded. The police force harbors a complete moral bankruptcy and lack of accountability for actions that wouldn't seem out of place in a 3rd world country. </p>
<p>Maybe some of them will enforce these Orwellian lockdown policies, maybe some wont. But I'd rather have fewer tyrannical enforcers, even if that means an increase in crime. Because right now the crime the government is committing against its citizens far outweighs the crimes citizens are committing against each other. </p>
<p>&rt; They're fucking american, or whatever.</p>
<p>No they're not. Anyone who supports China-style lockdown policies or enforces them is un-American.</p>

        <p>I get what you're saying here. What I'm saying is, most police officers, in the US, are American citizens. I guess I didn't realize how upisde down law enforcement had become. </p>
<p>Shit, I had friends that were cops back in Minneapolis 10 or 12 years ago. I would ride with them every once in awhile. Every cop I met seemed like pretty decent people. A lot of ex-military types. They had families. I'm sure there were some dip shits involved in shady stuff. I just don't think any of the guys I met would be jamming people up for stupid shit,  like the cops are doing these days. I guess things have changed pretty drastically over the years.</p>
<p>I'm assuming it has to be a top down issue? I guess the forces and their officers, that we're having to deal with now, are a reflection of the leadership? Makes sense why so many of them seem more than happy to arrest people for protecting their property with legally owned guns and toss people around for not wearing a piece of cloth over their mouth. Its tough to see a light at the end of the tunnel with all this shit going on.</p>

        <p>Well yeah, I mean, of course they're American citizens. But yeah, the systemic problems run deep. These days they don't hire very many ex-military types because military types won't put up with the unethical shit that goes on and anyone who they think might step a toe out of line gets forced out pretty quick. But I don't know for sure, I've never been a cop, just what I've heard from military guys. </p>
<p>I think it's more a problem with the unions. When you can't fire bad people, the organization gets corrupt. Just like the public school system. When you can't fire bad teachers the whole system becomes bad. When there are no longer repercussions for your actions, you can pretty much do whatever you want. </p>
<p>When cops can break into someone's house (no knock) and shoot them for pretty much no reason (qualified immunity), or steal someone's property for no reason (civil asset forfeiture), or arrest/fine someone for walking down the street (stay-at-home orders), you've pretty much got yourself the scaffolding for tyranny. While any one individual cop may not necessarily be corrupt,  I look at cops the same way I'd look at German soldiers in WWII. While it's not certain whether one individual cop may have committed tyrannical acts, the organization they chose to be a part of is absolutely evil, and by association, they deserve little respect unless they demonstrate otherwise.</p>

Are you able to talk freely with other officers or your bosses or is it all kept quiet?</p>

        <p>Objection and speculation of the laws and policies are completely openly discussed in the locker room and behind closed doors... and it’s only getting stronger. That’s why I have a positive outlook on things and was kind of the intent behind this post. We can’t talk publicly of course. </p>
<p>Luckily I haven’t personally had to fine or charge anyone for a covid law yet. Verbal warnings, prioritizing the more important things and officer discretion go a long way. But mostly because people are following the orders.. so far.</p>
<p>On the flip side seeing curfew enforcement and people arrested for jogging outside the 5km from their homes in Australia is terrifying. I can’t imagine any of my colleagues enforcing that and I hope that day never comes here where I would have to make that choice. Until then I feel speaking up inside is more effective then from outside.</p>

        <p>No people were snitching on other people who were hiding jews. Akin to snitching on businesses for letting people get away with not wearing masks. You gotta start somewhere I suppose? Also doesn't shutting a whole society down over a mild flu virus sound a little odd? Seeing as how we've had diseases more dangerous out for years and we never had a global shutdown.</p>

        <p>Man, I feel your pain. </p>
<p>I am also Canadian, and in a profession where being ordered to enforce CCPVirus related edicts upon the public, is a distinct possibility.</p>
<p>Outside work, I do not wear a mask, and refuse to participate in "CoronaSecurityTheatre". At work, I have made no attempt to hide my disdain and contempt for the stupid rules being forced down everyone's throats, the mass panic and exaggeration of this so-called "pandemic", and the politicians and health poo-bahs who have done this to my formerly "free" country.</p>
<p>I'm old enough to retire with a pension, and debating what to do if things get worse - and me and my underlings are drafted into acting as Corona enforcers, as has already happened in the UK and Australia.</p>
<p>I will have to make a decision, based on my conscience - go along, refuse to obey orders I feel are unlawful and immoral, or quit in protest.</p>
<p>I can tell you, going along isn't going to happen.</p>
<p>I hope you, and other members of Canadian police forces choose your conscience (and the hard-won freedoms of our citizens), over blind obedience.</p>

        <p>It's one of the options I'm considering. But the stuff about cashing out/lawsuits for wrongful dismissal etc doesn't apply.</p>
<p>I wish I could explain in more detail why, but I am well aware that very senior people in my organization troll sites like this looking for what they see as "extremists" and "conspiracy nuts" among us, so I can't due to risk of doxxing myself.</p>

        <p>How do you reconcile your oath with the Charter rights, which are obviously centre of mind in how you deal with evidence etc. It seems to me things will get more strict, not less strict, regardless of how the "pandemic" continues. But then again I can certainly understand the need to pick your battle.  If there's a breaking point I hope it happens before robotic enforcement drones are useful enough. Perhaps this just shows the need for something to be brought to the courts given that the police will seemingly be in support of any ruling in favour of charter rights. </p>
<p>Btw. How will police deal with civil charter damages suits in the meantime? Have your superiors not brought that issue up? </p>

        <p>Most of these laws violate the charter. This isn’t an opinion but fact. They are “legal” because 8 months in we remain in a “state of emergency” that supersedes the charter. The definition of which is so incredibly subjective. It gives the government extraordinary power for what’s supposed to be reserved only for extraordinary times. </p>
<p>My position is that the objective data does not at all constitute anything close to a state of emergency.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the reply. I guess I'm wondering if your superiors are considering how a state of emergency can over ride the charter when the federal emegency act itself states that it is subject to the charter. I know the charter itself has no "emergency" exit clause. A government has to use s. 33 on an explicit and ongoing basis for something against the charter to have any legal basis.</p>
<p>I would agree that the data even in May indicates none of us were in an emergency. I think it passed just like SARS 2003 did in March and April.</p>

        <p>&rt; In areas of the province of Quebec, gatherings of anyone from other households are now forbidden due to covid. Judges can provide a warrant for police to forcibly enter a private home if an illegal gathering is suspected - yes, the very act of inviting your own biological mother to sit at the table with her and have a coffee in your home is ILLEGAL. It is illegal and an armed agent of the state can break down your door for this illegal act. This feels dystopian. like a bad sci-fi movie. Dancing, singing, gathering, having a religious function and working out are now declared “illegal”. Meanwhile violent crime is increasing and actual criminals continue to operate with impunity. </p>
<p>Jesus christ that is insanity. They're actively killing people with those rules. What the fuck is the point in saving a handful people from covid if the cost is half your country suffering loneliness and such massive restrictions on your basic rights?</p>

        <p>Thank you for posting this, nice to see even some law enforcement are waking up to this.</p>
<p>I hope that enough law enforcement start refusing to enforce these BS restrictions, stand up to your superiors and say NO. Enough is enough, we will not force this upon citizen.   </p>
<p>I understand you have families to feed and care of, but so do many normal citizens and pushing these restrictions on us makes it worse. Standup for what’s right!</p>

        <p>I would say expect a sizable upsurge of COVID deaths in Quebec since they have authorized use of Long Term health care facilities to house non resident COVID positive. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/families-worried-long-term-care-homes-1.5769337">https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/families-worried-long-term-care-homes-1.5769337</a></p>
<p>The fact they did this in the US in the early stages and will obviously get away with it suing plausible deniability as their alibi, however at this stage to commit such an act should be considered premeditated murder, so how are they getting away with deliberately infecting and killing people and calling it a pandemic? Infect a Nursing home with typical pneumonia and you're going to achieve the same results.</p>
<p>On the subject of forcible entry, how convenient is that. For years the problem was that as you mentioned, police in Canada were under very stringent regulations preventing them from entering known locations of criminal activity. The fact that drug trafficking is a much more serious pandemic, killing and ruining countless lives every year, but 'hands are tied", and now for a virus, that carries little evidence of the lethal pandemic they claim, suddenly those regulations are set aside opening the door to legalized home invasion by the Police. </p>
<p>Now I'm not in your shoes, however, i find the most frustrating component is that the Police are going to abide by the new rules and allow this behavior.  This supports the argument and agenda of control. They have instilled fear into people in all facets, including threatening ones employment and subjecting them to public shaming to discourage lash back, and then use the people assigned to protect the pubic as a weapon against the public. </p>
<p>Like I said, I'm not in your shoes, and it's always easier said than done, but it's professions such as policing and medical that need to make a stand or this is just going to escalate.</p>
<p>On that note, good luck out there, stay safe and take care!</p>

        <p>Agreed. The censorship is the scariest part. If you’re in the medical, law enforcement or political field it is certain career suicide to publicly question the covid policies/laws and the data that’s driving them. </p>
<p>These are unprecedented regulations for a NOVEL virus. They need constant debate, criticism and evaluation by a variety of stakeholders - not just one or two public health officials wielding godly power.</p>
<p>In regards to other crime - The same bleeding heart crowd who call for defunding the police and tying our hands seem to want us to wield immense power to enforce lockdowns and measures. Things like shutting down basic services like water and power to people holding “illegal gatherings” at their homes, no trial, no innocent until proven guilty. The police to be judge, jury and punisher all in one. Measures that disproportionately affect minorities and the poor, which I find so incredibly strange. I am certainly not alone in my profession questioning these things.</p>

        <p>What's ironic also, is how people actually believed the stories of the "gag" orders placed on medical professionals from speaking out about how much more severe COVID really was and that it was being downplayed in the media. I was dumbfounded that people couldn't see how obvious this was and that they were literally launching a full blown fear campaign on the public then they compound it by saying how it's actually worse than claimed but the medial profession under threat of being discharged if they speak out.  The only threat that exists is the same censorship you speak of, which is the consequences of speaking the real truth.</p>
<p>I think one of the greatest challenges is that over the years they have made painstaking efforts to buy up all the science, therefore the experts who aren't on the payroll are very limited and easily dismissed as fringe science, therefore they get lumped in with the same perception of the conspiracy theorist. Even the legitimate scientists working in the Mainstream world, are handcuffed by the same censorship you face. Additionally they have perfected the silo principle whereby many of these scientists actually do not have the answers becasue they are confined to their specific research and never get to see all the data. Only those who run the operation get to make the interpretations and draw the conclusions of the science being conducted. </p>
<p>I agree those bleeding hearts are the typical hypocrites and only start shouting when it's convenient for them. My fascination lies within how well we have been trained to turn on each other on command, setting aside any reason or logic. This reaction is indicative of a society without individual purpose so they require a constant dose of purpose, and what better than creating a cause that will divide people and give them something to scream about. Unfortunately, the obvious pattern is they are exploiting a very powerful emotion that we possess which is hate, literally conditioning us to believe that we cannot survive without this emotion existing in our everyday lives.</p>
<p>Anyways my friend, I wish you all the best and fight that good fight, you are definitely not alone, and the world will need you and those like you in your position before this is over.</p>
<p>Take Care!</p>
