    <strong>The Protests in Sydney today have broken r/Sydney and r/CoronavirusDownunder</strong>
    <p><p>It seems people exercising thier freedom of association and expression has officially broken r/Sydney and r/CoronavirusDownunder . </p>
<p>Kinda scary how fast people go from 0 to Checka when they are scared. </p>
<p>Seems spamming the crimestoppers tip off line is the new official pastime of those sub reddits. I kinda feel sorry for the phone operators having to listen to hysterical sub-redditors all night. </p>
<p>In all seriousness, I don't know how this growing fracture within nations can be healed. I don't see much reaching over the aisle to understand each other.</p>
<p>Edit: aaaannnndddd I'm permabanned for none other than "misinformation." I've offered to provide any number of primary sources to support any assertions I've made, but seems mod-supported threats of violence within that sub are more important.</p></p>

        <p>As I was reading them, I noticed there's a pattern amongst posters... they love dropping the f-bomb because it adds effect to otherwise regurgitated sentiments. They're also uncommonly violent. Like. Uncommonly so. Unacceptably so. Also, not a single comment in support. There's a lot of censored material that can be accessed through other means.</p>

        <p>I made the point in my ban reply to highlight the seemingly endless amount of threats of violence. It's surprising to see although I think it's all keyboard fluster, these people in any situation in real life that raised thier heart beat about 80bpm would melt like chocolate I'm sure. </p>
<p>I haven't seen the censored content, but I'm not surprised. If it doesn't fit the inner city apartment living green/leftist permitted thought guidelines, it's out. </p>
<p>Well the good news is this isn't their city.</p>

        <p>I think these subs must be full of teens and young adults who have never been challenged in their lives. Everything is delivered to them, they have no idea how the world functions, and they are happy to sit at home playing with electronics while the state turns into a dictatorship. The "sacrifice" they make to comply with lockdowns is not actually a sacrifice, because they aren't doing anything different. A bunch of virtue signalling about "coming together to do the right thing" is the biggest laugh when it comes at literally no cost to you. Half of them probably have parents who work for the government and get paid no matter what. </p>
<p>They are the height of arrogance. They are stupid and inexperienced beyond belief, yet cannot reflect on same. If you are so stupid that you have no response to the government telling you not to go OUTSIDE (where germ spread is lessened), I really don't know what to say. These idiots are leading us to the new system of functional police states.</p>
<p>You want to change society? Get upper-middle class children off their screens and into the real world, where shit ain't so easy.</p>

        <p>I understand what you are saying and I'm sure in a lot of cases you are right, but just anecdotally  I'm a young person who fits all of these criteria and I realize how badly these lockdowns and forcing bylaws and other things affected Canadians even tho they did not affect me really. I am very against the lockdown overreach we experienced and are still experiencing in many places in Canada especially Quebec and Ontario.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I'm the only one of my friends who thinks this way one of my buddies who supported the lockdowns because he said "their not real lockdowns" and I said oh so do you wanna lock people in their homes with pipes like chain and he just shrugged was really pissed at him their anyways he got sketched out about the vaccine bcz of the magnetic arm vids lol my other buddy took it and I know I dont need it... still pissed at my other buddy for supporting these lockdowns he might change his mind now and interesting enough the buddy who ook the vax understood my qualms with the lockdowns ppl r fucking weird man</p>
<p>In Ontario we have 14 million people and 1,076 million km2 of land in Ontario.... Compare that to somewhere like the greater Los angeles area that has 18 million people and 12,562 km2.....</p>
<p>the fact that we had lockdowns for longer than LA is utterly mind blowing sorry for spell/grammar this is a venty post and I have RSI</p>

        <p>I appreciate what you're saying and I didn't want to generalize too much, but had to keep the comment simple.</p>
<p>The difference is that you think about people who aren't like you. So do I. Most people don't, as far as I can tell. I will say that you, a young person who already understands the basic problems with the "lockdown philosophy" is likely way more intelligent/mature than average. But the social pressure to go along with these policies is immense, for your age and at any age.</p>
<p>Because neither you or I are affected too much by lockdowns (I think that implication is in your comment, forgive me if wrong), we could easily play this game of "I'm in support of whatever keeps people 'safe'"... instead, we can see that it's not right even if it doesn't really affect <em>us</em>.</p>
<p>My general belief is that people who support lockdowns while having literally <em>no skin in the game</em> (like me, if I did support them) are the worst type of hypocrites, and are bad for society. But they are almost by definition more powerful than the rest of us, because to have no skin in the game requires certain pre-existing advantages. Every politician has acted the same way as before. Half of them went on vacation anyway. Every executive found a way to go on their vacation, and their big companies hauled in as much or more money. Most government employees "(didn't) work from home" for a year and got full pay and half a year of vacation without using vacation pay. How easy is it to cheer on "lockdowns" when they are literally an advantage to your personal situation. As a kid, I would have loved not showing up for school for various long periods.</p>
<p>But it's a severe ethical failing to support being <em>advantaged</em> by something that is causing other people misery. But they are close to sociopathic I think. Screw them all.</p>
<p>(Also: I sit in front of a screen lots and did when I was a teenager too (before the internet). I know it's not a good way to live now, but I didn't understand what I was doing to myself when I was a teen. I don't really expect today's kids to understand that either. The culture and adults have failed. I am not blaming teens in a simple way.)</p>

        <p>These bots have been working like this for a long time. I have seen this happen to many subs like r/India that sub doesn't even have actual people living in India and they absolutely hate India itself. These subs are taken over to run a narrative and make it seem there is a narrative when there actually is not. It has been happening for decades with reddit censorship. Its a demoralization tactic and a way to brainwash newbies into the narrative. Don't be bothered.</p>

        <p>Ive seen the video, needless to say he didn't punch the horse. It does look like he was pushing its head away as it swung around and yet again it's another example of the online outrage mob getting it wrong and <em>manufacturing truth</em> by shear noise.</p>

        <p>I’m suspicious that a majority of them are bots. Think about it: bots driving the narrative to hate the unvaccinated. I am not sure that that hate is organic....it has to be repeatedly hammered into peoples’ heads to change the sentiment. Brainwashing 101.</p>
<p>Best to take it with a grain of salt. I have met exactly 0 people IRL with this level of vitriol toward the unvaccinated.</p>
