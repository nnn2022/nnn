        <p>I feel I need to reply to the individual comments aswell. So I'll just go in order</p>
<p>1) Its hypocrisy if a sub reddit about free speech and rights was to remove a post that goes against their views. Wasnt calling this sub reddit hypocritical.</p>
<p>2) I don't even get how this one was rude, I said I would go crazy to if.... soo I don't get this one</p>
<p>3) See point one, simply saying if you do such it shows you are being hypocritical, I was covering all bases.</p>
<p>4) Yeh don't, again don't see how that's rude.</p>
<p>5) Some people in this sub reddit do show a complete lack of knowledge to economics and yet try to solve the issue of economics. Again not a rude thing to point out.</p>
<p>6) Again not sure how that is rude, with context it looks less demeaning.</p>
<p>7) Similar to point 5, it is not wrong to point out fault in something, someone, or a group when in a civilised discussion such as now. This is a healthy debate I will not say everyone is perfect when I do  not feel that way.</p>
<p>I do not appreciate you rude comment</p>

        <p>I dunno if I’m wasting my finger muscles but think about it. Unless you have doomer friends or possibly scientists friends, where do you receive your information on climate change? The news right? Thought so.. also wasn’t there a big channel 4 climate change debate where they used a melting ice sculpture in place of Boris Johnson. Regardless if I’m British or not i can what goes on in the world around me.</p>

        <p>Well then go and watch it. Yes the get info from government funded scientists and what do the scientists do go and spread the word amongst each other and their friends? No. It gets subtly plastered on MSM platforms in the most fear mongering ways. I suggest you clue yourself up more tbh. I wouldn’t bother watching the channel 4 debate where all the political leaders of the uk and opposition discus amongst each other. You’d get more sense out of a cute puppy video on YT.</p>

        <p>Qwerty. </p>
<p>The death numbers have been waaaaay overblown. The way they are recorded is totally fraudulent. If someone tests positive (the PCR test is also being misused to inflate the case numbers) and dies for any reason whatsoever within 28 days (literally you could get hit by a bus) it goes down as a covid death. So that 2 million figure is absolute bs.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no evidence to suggest that masks work at all. Its just a symbol of oppression and acquiescence to authority. Also a way for doomers to virtue signal and feel morally and intellectually superior over people who actually have a set of balls. </p>
<p>You have been totally misled my friend. Stop watching the news for a week and see if it still feels like a pandemic. If its so deadly then why do we have to be constantly reminded of it? Why do most people need a test to even know that they have it? Why aren't all the homeless people dropping like flies on the streets? </p>
<p>If it was half as deadly as they say, we wouldn't need to be told. It would be very obvious and everyone would feel rightly motivated to act accordingly. Governments wouldn't need to strong arm and guilt people into locking themselves away and covering their faces. </p>
<p>Look up the great Barrington declaration. Look up Dr. Vernon Coleman.</p>

<p>It'll work in England with Keir Starmer over the next few years. </p>
<p>Your entire essay hinges on the presupposition that masks and lockdowns work without question. Can you prove that this is the case by providing facts &amp; peer-reviewed studies without simply making an appeal to authority? </p>
<p>Nobody knows if the vaccine works yet, with the most prominent member of that club being the creators of it. </p>
<p>And, for the record, climate change is absolutely a big political matter in England. Not sure why you suggest it isn't?</p>

Rather than using insults and convoluted language just show me how masks don't work.

<p>You are fucking hilarious. </p>
<p>So, in your eyes, the burden of proof is on me to confirm 100% that masks/lockdowns don't work but you don't need to offer anything beyond a baseless presupposition that they do work given to you by your masters?</p>
<p>How much effort did you put into curating the evidence that supports your current stance? Or did you just accept it from the media with no question or independent thought? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;  Also a big point, why do the majority of people agree with me and its only a select few like this sub that believes they have special knowledge on the matter. </p>
<p>Because they, too, are low intelligence or lazy people who get all of their knowledge, facts and opinions from a limited number of media outlets and are too scared to break from the crowd because of the security &amp; positive feedback loop offered by the crowd.</p>
<p>Nazi Germany had the majority following the crowd - that doesn't mean they were the ones who were right. It just means it's easy to manipulate people who don't question authority. </p>
<p>You are the epitome of an NPC and you come in here looking for debate like you have something useful to offer when you can't even grasp the use of basic punctuation.</p>

        <p>Qwerty. Howdy, Uk non-conservative. Hates echo chambers too, but at least this one is slightly friendlier than the pro-lockdown ones.</p>
<p>I won’t change your mind. Masks/lockdown appears to be one of those issues that resonate one way or another with people’s fundamental world view.</p>
<p>For me it’s about being responsible for your <em>own</em> health. If I were, for whatever reason, vulnerable to a contagion that most others weren’t, It would not be right to burden anyone else with this. I would stay at home or wear a respirator when around others.  I would <em>never</em> expect others to have to stay at home or where a mask to account for <em>my</em> poor health. To do so seems wrong to me.</p>
<p>The fact that so many other people (and all of those now in power) appear to believe the <em>exact</em> opposite is unnerving. The fact that I am now portrayed as human garbage by mainstream propaganda (apt term) <em>scares</em> me.</p>

        <p>I think It’s entirely political. </p>
<p>The first evidence that made me doubt this was the response to a freedom of information request. Made to health Canada. It asked if there is proof the virus has been isolated. </p>
<p>Isolated so that you can say. Look that is covid. Then infect someone with it to confirm the symptoms match what’s expected. </p>
<p>The Irish government was also asked this. Both health Canada and the Irish gov. Said nope. It’s not been isolated. </p>
<p>We also have the inventor of the PCR equipment statement about how the PCR equipment should not be used to test for viruses. You can get a positive result without putting anything in the machine. </p>
<p>Then it was the thousands of doctors speaking out against the lockdown and now the vaccine. </p>
<p>The lockdowns are immensely harmful. No way is the lockdown work extending the lives of those over 70 by a year or 2. Yes that’s all this is about. </p>
<p>At some point it will be common knowledge how harmful the lockdowns were. We will hear about how many people lost their businesses and how many killed themselves. At that point many will lie and say they never supported the lockdown.</p>

        <p>This debate is about wearing a mask however. I do believe the lockdown is harmful but only because it is being extended due to peoples ignorance towards masks</p>
