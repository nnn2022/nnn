        <p>It’s not that they make you stupid. It’s that stupid people are wearing them. It’s like the chicken and the egg. Which came first?  It doesn’t really matter. All that matters is some people  that are wearing masks are stupid and apparently getting increasingly so.</p>

        <p>It’s because a mask serious limits the amount of oxygen you’re able to get to your blood cells and your brain, while increasing the amount of carbon dioxide you breathe in. The masks actually are starting to cause mouth rot, and a failure of the lungs.</p>

        <p>Yes, I am noticing cashiers having trouble counting change as well. :( This was already a growing problem in the last couple decades but it is much worse now.</p>
<p>Reduced oxygen to brain causes people to react slower, and second-guess themselves in situations where they normally wouldn't. </p>

        <p>It's not a law, so just quit wearing it. If you are fired you can sue. I was working the same job last year and had to quit because the tips dried up. Good luck, be brave and stand up. It's up to you though either way, I sympathize with you as a former food service/cust service/hospitality worker. </p>
<p>Doing my best to wake the people up to this scam, we are winning but holy fuck it is taking a long time to get these people to look at simple data and turn off the hellevision.</p>
<p>Cite the following; HIPAA privacy rule 45 CFR part 160 subparts A &amp; E of part 164, March 26 2013. You can not wear mask for safety/health reasons. If your employer asks "What condition?" They are in violation of the law, so record the interaction if you can and file suit in small claims it is cheap and easy to do.</p>
<p>edit: Part 164 link is conveniently broken, of course. https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/index.html</p>
<p>edit2: Wow they even scrubbed it from archive.org. Should be able to find it at university or local library, photocopy it.</p>

        <p>Shouldn't wear ANYTHING on your face for more than a minute. That mask may allow you to still breathe, but it also still collects bacteria. We are doing our best to end this bullshit, the more people we have not wearing a mask at all the easier it gets. We must wake up the sheeple, OUR survival depends on them waking the fuck up.</p>

        <p>I gotta seriously find a way to escape my current living situation.</p>
<p>My brother first tried to guilt-trip me into getting tested or wearing a mask IN-HOUSE because he got tested and is concerned he might have the virus, and concerned for our parents. And when I refused, citing many of our (us skeptics in this and similar subreddits) reasons, he flipped his lid and went full-doomer.</p>
<p>This is the 2nd time he's tested and I feel like every time he'll have symptoms or have a cold/flu he's gonna get tested.</p>
<p>It's friggin terrible that I live in the Bay Area and therefore can't afford to move to my own place temporarily but I'm gonna have to find some sort of living situation. Can't be here long term if my brother is this level of doomer</p>

<p>I tried to show them the references too but it's just in one ear and right out the other. The propaganda is driving families apart. Stay strong my friend. Go to point reyes or some other beach and reflect; that always helped me when I was in the bay area.</p>

        <p>Haha I noticed that when I lived there. I didn't grow up there so I explored a lot. There was a show on PBS called bay area backroads. Also lived in my car for a short time so I would sleep near the redwoods one night and could be at the beach in minutes. </p>
<p>Point Reyes is on the northern side of golden gate. Tons of cool beaches off the coastal hwy 1 as well. </p>
<p>Stinson beach(north of golden gate) all the way to north of Jenner, CA. Bodega bay is cool too (that's where alfred hitchcocks 'the birds' was filmed)</p>
<p>People weren't very friendly where I lived there so I made friends with the beaches, backroads etc. Petaluma to Tomales is a neat drive. Last time I went through there I drove through clear lake area and spotted a massive california condor. It's fun to sit on the beach cliffs with binoculars and watch the whales. Very peaceful.</p>

        <p>A bigger problem with masks is that they add to situational uncertainty and therefore to anxiety in an already anxiety-promoting context. This has far reaching consequences that are definitely negative even if we do not fully understand them.  https://culturalanalysis.net/2020/08/05/de-facing-victoria/</p>

        <p>This quote nails it.</p>
<p>As Theodore Dalrymple wrote, “In my study of communist societies, I came to the conclusion that the purpose of communist propaganda was not to persuade or convince, not to inform, but to humiliate; and therefore, the less it corresponded to reality the better. When people are forced to remain silent when they are being told the most obvious lies, or even worse when they are forced to repeat the lies themselves, they lose once and for all their sense of probity. To assent to obvious lies is in some small way to become evil oneself. One’s standing to resist anything is thus eroded, and even destroyed. A society of emasculated liars is easy to control.”</p>
