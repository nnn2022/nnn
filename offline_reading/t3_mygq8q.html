    <strong>Prophetic sentence from 2018.</strong>
    <p><p>John Barry's book, The Great Influenza, about the 1918 flu had an afterword written for the 2018 paperback edition:</p>
<p>&rt; So the problems presented by a pandemic are, obviously, immense. But the biggest problem lies in the relationship between governments and the truth.</p>
<p>Barry continues:</p>
<p>&rt; For if there is a single dominant lesson from 1918, it’s that governments need to tell the truth in a crisis. Risk communication implies managing the truth. You don’t manage the truth. You tell the truth.</p>
<p>&rt; So the final lesson of 1918, a simple one yet one most difficult to execute, is that those who occupy positions of authority must lessen the panic that can alienate all within a society. Society cannot function if it is every man for himself. By definition, civilization cannot survive that. Those in authority must retain the public’s trust. The way to do that is to distort nothing, to put the best face on nothing, to try to manipulate no one.</p></p>
