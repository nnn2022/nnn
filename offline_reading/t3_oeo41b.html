    <strong>Dominion day rally in Ottawa.</strong>
    <p><p>So I attended this so called rally, which looked more like political campaigning and if you ask me I’m honestly disgusted by the way the whole day played out.  Now, it seems the organizers and Chris sky are engaged in an on going twitter battle, aka dick swinging contest, that neither one will let go.  Ffs how is this helping anyone?!  Having politicians take over a freedom movement is not a good sign.</p>
<p>I saw agitators planted within the crowd.  They heckled at the aboriginal children’s lives matter protest, but that’s another big discussion in its self.</p></p>

        <p>I would also like to say the infowars banner they flew on stage instantly discredited them with most people who dropped in and were genuinely curious to hear what they had to say.</p>
<p>Not only did that discredit the movement but the Stew Peters interview with Chris Sky where they claimed hundreds of thousands of protesters were there and then should grainy video.  Ya no, maybe 500, and I’m being generous.  I’m getting so sick of the politics and lies!</p>
