        <p>Ironically this is the 9/11 of this generation.
And just like 20 years ago, hundreds of millions will believe what they're told about the situation.</p>

        <p>Knowing how obviously false the official narrative was to begin with, how thoroughly it’s been debunked with twenty years of hindsight, and how much people simply don’t care about the reality of false flag terrorism, I have practically zero hope for this generation to figure this one out before the next generated crisis is put into motion.</p>

        <p>I have to admit that I drank the KoolAid back in the day.  But WTC 7 perplexes me.  Also the fact all those buildings came down like a controlled demolition.  And also the rush to war in Iraq when the intelligence didn’t point in that direction.</p>

        <p>WTC 7 wasn't a controlled demolition.  I've watched all the footage, watched the BBC reports that came early, watched the special with Ed Asner, read the full NIST report.  </p>
<p>Pay close attention to the penthouse when the building is collapsing.  In the "freefall" clips they try to angle from lower so it's difficult to see but there are several clips that you can see it come down into the building first and then the building gets pulled down around it.  The damage from the collapsing WTC1+2 and the ongoing fire are plausible causes for the specific joint failures listed in the NIST report leading to the penthouse collapse and progressive collapse of the rest of the building.    </p>
<p>I'm not saying everything in the official story is true, I'm not saying that the planes weren't a false flag, I'm not saying Bush/Blair/the Council on Foreign Relations/the illuminati weren't complicit....but WTC 7 came down as a consequence of WTC 1+2.</p>

        <p>You can't collapse that cleanly into your own footprint as a 47-story steel-framed skyscraper without it being controlled. Nor can you accelerate to freefall speed. Even NIST admitted freefall for certain floors.</p>

        <p>The fact that the majority of people seriously believe that nineteen men with boxcutters were being directed by a guy on dialysis from a cave halfway around the world, and that these ragtag rascals managed to pull off the most sophisticated penetration of the most heavily defended airspace on the planet, it all speaks entirely for itself — you actually have to be stupid or not thinking critically in the least to believe in the honesty of the people spinning such an obviously ridiculous narrative.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, the authorities across multiple federal agencies, the Air Force included, <em>just so happened</em> to have all of their collective pants down at the exact same moment that the terrorists decided to carry out their dastardly master plan!”</p>

        <p>At the exact same time there was as a training mission in which terrorists hijacked a plane to crash it into a building. When the call about the actual hijacking came in there was confusion as to whether the call was part of the drill or not. What a convenient coincidence. I personally remember hearing about this on the news. Don't see anyone bringing this up any more.</p>

        <p>It wasn’t that sophisticated. Airport security was very lax up to that point in time. At least one plane the hijackers said they had a bomb. All 4 easily gained access to the cockpit.</p>

        <p>Sophisticated, according to the official narrative, because the simplest possible explanation is that they were enabled by a few people working within the US government who wanted the attacks to happen, so instead they fed everybody a ridiculously convoluted story about how Bin Laden and his boys were a bunch of evil geniuses, so evil that the US had to invade those countries if the bad guys were ever going to be stopped.</p>
<p>It’s not like there was no security — sure, things were relatively more relaxed than they have been since the event, however the official story makes no sense at face value, and the people who believe it are essentially placing their faith in the honesty of folks like George Bush and Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld, which says everything about their level of understanding barely having scratched the surface of how politics and social control really works.</p>
<p>Of course, corporate media and the Bush administration called it a “failure of imagination” and played stupid, like it was all one big coincidence that multiple airplanes managed to fly so far off course and directly into such heavily defended airspace without being intercepted by a single fighter jet, and people ate it up without hesitation because their faith in their institutions and so-called authorities is more powerful than their own decision making capability, which is very much the same with this current, purposefully generated covid crisis.</p>

        <p>9/11 gave us such hits as the patriot act and the TSA. Which i was all for at the time and also as an adult. because terrorism bad. then you kinda noticed as you grew up that it was just a power grab. just like with the wuhan flu there was an issue. very dangerous. very real. and all the solutions did was concentrate more power. the patriot act didnt make us safer. it just gave more power. and covid is the same. how do people not see this? everyone admits that bush kinda sucked and the fallout from 9/11 was bullshit. but oh this time its different...</p>

        <p>I understand you and agree.  I will go further, I think the toppling of Iraq and Afghanistan should have been followed by the toppling of Iran.  and further, those regions should have been broken up into the traditional ethnicities.  Image if a real Kurdish country had been formed at that borders of Turkey, Lesser Iraq, and Iran.  It would fix so many problems</p>

        <p>i think we shouldnt have done anything but carpet bomb the fuck out of every military target in the region. then drop pamphlets says "fix your shit or next time we do every inch". thats it. no boots. and i agree as well though. nothing but half measures in the area. we should have redrawn the whole area. made it more stable.</p>

        <p>What? Isn't the covid restrictions fully lifted in the US? I live in California and I am absolutely free to live life as before. Like 100% the same. No masks, huge sport events, family gatherings, nice concerts.  Can travel to wherever I want. Yeah I took the vaccine. 4 months ago, zero side effects. But I have been taking vaccines my whole life so that is a return to normal for me.</p>
<p>Or is this sub only against the vaccine?  I am truly confused.</p>

<p>So,  you don't take public transportation,  don't go in hospitals or schools,  and you have no reason to visit anyone at a prison or homeless shelter.</p>
<p>&rt; But I have been taking vaccines my whole life so that is a return to normal for me.</p>
<p>Well,  sure..  you behave the way they want.  They're not trying to punish you.</p>
<p>&rt; Or is this sub only against the vaccine? I am truly confused.</p>
<p>Take it,  don't take it..  but California still requires that the unvaccinated go masked indoors in all settings,  and your life is apparently charmed enough that you fail to see this for the slippery slope it is.  And <em>that</em> is what we're against.</p>

        <p>I won't debate vaccines because I know I won't convince no one here and it's fine...</p>
<p>Honestly I don't see the slippery slope simply because it doesn't exist. You say that is a slippery slope because unvax people are still restricted. But are they? I have been to so many places this last month and there is zero control. No one asks or check if you were vaccinated. No one asking for  covid passports. No discrimination or prejudice. Unvaccinated people can live their life as free as the vaccinated people. The only thing I can remember is cruises that might be asking but that is a business decision not mandated by government that probably won't last. </p>
<p>Yeah some places are still asking for mask as you pointed out hospitals. Honestly the weak virus can only impact elderly and sick person so it doesn't seem to be that bad of an idea. And pretty soon that will be off. </p>
<p>I get the idea of the sub. And maybe in some places in the world the logic applies, I can't speak for anything other than the US. But at some point there needs to be a recognition that this whole panic that the government will use this as the new 9/11 to control the population long term is already not happening.  You were wrong, it happens. The same way people treating the virus as the end of the world were wrong. Life is already back 100% normal to most people. The few that are not will be there in a few months.</p>

        <p>&rt; But are they?</p>
<p>The government explicitly considers this it's domain.  The calls to increase enforcement on this point exist.  And,  as it turns out,  often documented in posts to this sub.</p>
<p>&rt; is already not happening.</p>
<p>Oh,  okay..  then we all should go back to bed?  Nothing to worry about.  No reason to be concerned about what just happened and what it might portend in the future..  because <em>you</em> personally don't observe any issues in your immediate vicinity.  I'm not trying to be mean,  just pointing out the obvious flaw in this reasoning.</p>
<p>&rt; You were wrong, it happens.</p>
<p>I've already said in other posts here that as soon as this shit is over,  I'm out;  I have no love of prolonging this in any way whatsoever.  I'm happy to admit,  that's very close to being true for <em>me</em> personally as well...  but there are still troubling developments on this topic,  so it's worth being attentive.  I wouldn't wave your flag <em>just</em> yet.</p>
<p>&rt; The few that are not will be there in a few months.</p>
<p>Yea..  they just have to deal with gestapo tactics until then.  That you are unconcerned is fine,  that you'd attempt to turn into a victory lap here is odd.</p>

        <p>Some parts of the US they do what they want and that's good because it is not a deadly virus, and I am deeply sorry for the people who died because of a mixed up medication because of other disseases they had and if you can read good the economy, people who died mostly of them was a government expenses. I hope someday people can understand how the corona international trending really started. Anyways hats off to California!</p>

        <p>It’s funny, I’ve moved away from libertarianism since all of this. Mostly because if realized libertarianism allows for and even supports corporate oppression because “but muh private business”, and the governments have figured out they can get away with using private businesses to enforce the policies they can’t.</p>

        <p>well, I don't agree with Libertarian party types with dogmatic views of what it should be.</p>
<p>I think for myself, I don't outsource my thinking to a party or ideology.</p>
<p>The thing is, some companies really are not much different than the government itself, and they get special tax treatment or special regulatory treatment.</p>
<p>And at that stage, the "muh private business" thing doesn't make sense  because they are barely a private business.</p>

        <p>Yeah, funny how that all works out, ain't it?  </p>
<p>I mean, in theory, I genuinely have no problem with an individual or a company or what have you making billions and billions of goddamn dollars. Long as they do it without bullshit government shenanigans.  </p>
<p>Shit like high-level executives "leaving" (lol, right) a company in order to serve in some "key" government-appointed position. And shit rolling the other way, too. Politicians leaving office and immediately segueing into a high-level executive position at some big corporation.  </p>
<p>As the owner of a small business myself, I'm absolutely in favor of less government interference, but I'm not completely against basic forms of regulation or anything. Corporations should be separate from the state in the same way as religions are supposed to be. Corporatocracies are just as bad as theocracies.</p>

        <p>Libertarianism is in some ways more of a problem for the right than leftism, because it neutralizes a lot of effort and energy that could be used constructively by the right.  Notice how they never directly confront the left on anything, but are quick to criticize the right as vociferously as any leftist.  Their rejection of any kind of collectivism or organization on the right is genuinely helpful to the people in charge, that's why they exist.</p>
<p>And as you said, "free marketism" has been highjacked.  It's a power apparatus that can be infiltrated and subverted, so that's what the left will do to achieve its utopian goals.  A century ago they infiltrated and highjacked governments, now the targets are corporate boards of directors and HR departments.</p>

        <p>I completely agree. So many Libertarians are like edgy children who want to scream and yell at mom and dad rather than deal with the intruder at the door, as a cohesive unit. But I mostly blame that on the popularization of purely philosophical political ideologies like Communism and Anarchism becoming more popular in American Libertarianism.</p>
<p>If we actually had a true free market, liberals wouldn’t be able to infiltrate it and use it to their advantage. Places like Walmart and Amazon wouldn’t exist if they couldn’t subsidize their businesses and employees with socialist programs and government handouts. Problem is just like Communism and Anarchism, a truly free market is purely philosophical. It will never exist.</p>

        <p>What are you guys talking about? I live in California and life is basically back to normal.  Haven't used a mask in ages. Took the vaccine, which is something I have done multiple times in my life with zero side effect. Have been meeting friends and family as normal. Went to a stadium with almost 40k people 2 weeks ago and a waterfront show this weekend. All no mask or crazyness. No mask in groceries store or anywhere. I can travel and do whatever I want.</p>
<p>Where do you guys live that lockdown is still enforced? Or even masks mandatory. The temporary government measures are definetly gone. Why are you saying that is permanent?</p>

        <p>As anyone who grew up in Pennsylvania would know, the Johnstown flood tax is still in effect almost 90 years after it was imposed. Any temporary measure is always meant to be permanent. </p>
<p>They slip it in through the back door because they know it would not pass otherwise. The whole "you need an ID to fly" was actually passed in response to the Flight 800 explosion, which was eventually blamed on a fuel vapor explosion. OK, so why are we still showing ID to travel in our own country 25 years later? 9/11 cemented that BS in to law without anyone actually thinking about how it came in to being to begin with. Domestic passports are a thing in totalitarian states like the USSR and China, yet we accepted them with glee. All because the talking heads told us to. This country has become a nation of mindless sheep.</p>

        <p>The covid restriction laws have expiration dates built in that can only get extended if there's still a pandemic going on by the time they're reached. Which you'd know if you actually read the laws.</p>

<p>If that was actually the goal of the government they wouldn't fund vaccine development and roll out. They wouldn't even make the restrictions quite as strict.</p>

        <p>Yeah, look at all these Covid regulations still in full effect. Oh wait, there aren't any. Everyone stopped wearing masks over a month ago because all of the risk groups are now fully vaccinated, and most businesses are operating normally. But you guys wouldn't know because you refused to observe those regulations in the first place, huh?</p>

        <p>Go get on a plane without a mask then, hot-shot. See how far your little pfizer talisman gets you. That's right, you still have to wear a mask, vaccinated or not. So yes, there are still COVID regulations in place, even for you. "But I'm one of the good, morally altruistic members of society. I got the fauci ouchie". They don't give a fuck about that.

        <p>How r3tarded do you have to be to think that all conservatives share the exact same opinions on everything? Bush is not at all the same flavor of conservatism as someone like Trump, much the same as how Bernie Sanders is not at all the same brand of liberalism as Kamala Harris.</p>

        <p>Well.. you all are a text  book cult.  So there's that .. being kind of high on that spectrum of "sharing the exact same opinions"</p>
<p>Whatever Trump says, does, or doesn't. Doesn't matter what your GEOTUS says, does, or doesn't, even contradicting himself in the same breath.... he's got 43% approval.</p>
