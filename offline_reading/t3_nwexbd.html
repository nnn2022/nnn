    <strong>Doublethink Bingo</strong>
    <p><p><strong>J</strong>ust listing off all the popular <em>CNN-style</em> <strong>doublethink</strong> that I can think of!_</p>
<p>Medical abuse is real, profitable and significantly impacts marginalized communities.</p>
<p><em>Doctors would never lie to us.</em></p>
<p>Doctors with an agenda are pushing the heartbeat bill and going against science for their own gain.</p>
<p><em>Doctors would never push an agenda or ignore science for their own gain.</em></p>
<p>Medical authorities have a documented history of malpractice and abusing women, we need to listen to women.</p>
<p><em>The vaccines do not affect women's fertility or menses cycles, the women reporting it are lying.</em></p>
<p>Capitalism is worldwide and exploited by those in power to subdue their populace.</p>
<p><em>The lockdown is worldwide and thus cannot possibly be being exploited by those in power to subdue their populace.</em></p>
<p>The government is capable of genocide against any marginalized group and has committed such many times in recorded history.</p>
<p><em>The government would never do anything to harm us.</em></p>
<p>Child labor was legal and immoral.</p>
<p><em>The government would never make something immoral legal.</em></p>
<p>All cops are dangerous, there are no good cops, calling the cops is racist and endangers PoC.</p>
<p><em>Cops are critical and must be called immediately on any lawbreaking neighbours.</em></p>
<p>Covid cannot be caught at a BLM protest.</p>
<p><em>A concert is a superspreader event.</em></p>
<p>Scientists are 'allowed' to make mistakes, re: mask usage/airborne or surface spread, etc.</p>
<p><em>The scientists are never wrong so we must do everything they say without question, because they are not wrong so nothing they say will cause harm to us.</em></p>
<p>Mental health is important. Anxiety is a real illness and people suffering from it deserve to be accommodated. It is ableist to insist someone can simply will their way out of a mental illness.</p>
<p><em>If you cannot wear a mask due to a physical or mental illness, you are lying and deserve to die alone in your basement. Just get over it.</em></p>
<p>It is my body, my decision. Even if it saves another's life, no one can force me to undergo a medical procedure.</p>
<p><em>You absolutely must take an experimental vaccine you are uncomfortable with as it has a .005% chance of giving a dying elder an extra 3 hours.</em></p>
<p>'Abuse' is also when a spouse threatens to withhold food, finances or steal the children. Coercion is not choice.</p>
<p><em>You will not be permitted to work or acquire food if you do not have a mask or vaccine. You will be imprisoned and your children removed if you defy these rules. This does not make the mask/vaccine mandatory.</em></p>
<p>Covid does not discriminate. Always wear a mask.</p>
<p><em>So long as you are sitting down, you do not need a mask.</em></p>
<p>The vaccine works.</p>
<p><em>Wear a mask as you can still spread covid with the vaccine. Everyone must be vaccinated as the vaccinated can still get sick.</em></p>
<p><strong>I</strong>'m sure there are more, do post them :-)</p></p>

        <p>You can spread COVID even if you don’t have symptoms, which is why everyone needs to wear a mask and socially distance, because you never know if you might have it and spread it to the vulnerable! </p>
<p><em>The vaccine is great because it reduces covid symptoms to such a degree that you’ll be less likely to spread it if you get infected, so you don’t need to wear a mask or socially distance anymore!</em></p>
