    <strong>Keep in mind that most people pushing the current lockdowns, restrictions, vaccination mandates and passports,... believe they are doing a good thing. If you want to shift their perspective, you need to put yourself in their shoes.</strong>
    <p><p>I think what most people miss is that a vast majority of people (minus perhaps a variety of psychopaths in positions of governmental and corporate power, desiring more wealth and control) believe that what they are doing and helping to push in regard to this pandemic, from the lockdowns, restrictions, mandates, to the vaccines... is a net positive and will help the majority.</p>
<p>Sure, some people don't care at all either way, but most people have an inherent sense of compassion (which is of course wonderful) — and that sense of compassion is being played here by corporate and governmental interests, as well as by pure ignorance (if we go by Hanlon's Razor).</p>
<p>Many probably understand that there are negative sides to all the restrictions, lockdowns, even in terms of vaccines,... However they believe the good outweighs the bad, the rewards outweigh the risks.</p>
<p>If you want to help them see a different perspective, how the lockdowns may be causing more harm than good (higher and often serious mental health issues, including suicide rates, economic destruction and destabilisation...), how <a href="https://media.mercola.com/ImageServer/Public/2021/June/PDF/covid-19-vaccine-mistake-pdf.pdf">the safety of the vaccines is questionable</a>... Etc. you need to show them a different perspective, optimally with solid, scientific research. As well as not being aggressive towards them and listening to their perspective, understanding their position.</p>
<p>The only way to make this situation better is to change the minds of the masses and raise awareness. Make sure you do it gently and well.</p>

        <p>I agree. Sometimes that can be hard when people are trying to tell you they get to make a decision over what you put into your body. People are afraid and when in a state of fear logic can be hard to find. And we are in a constant state of fear right now. A lot of people are literally stuck in a constant fear response therefore cannot communicate effectively. I’m trying to have compassion for everyone’s responses in this mess.</p>

        <p>Some are like this, but not all. Also, in real life people act differently than on the Internet and it's more easy to share one's perspective. Internet discussions, especially on Reddit are closed echo chambers, which include people paid to spread propaganda, bots, people that are extremely reactive due to being online all the time...</p>
<p>In short, I'd always advise we treat everyone freshly, every situation and person with fresh eyes, as they say in Zen, with a beginner's mind.</p>

        <p>While I agree, I think most of the reason they think what they're doing is good is because they've been told it's good by the "authorities". In the conversations I've had with them and I've seen them have with others, almost everything they say boils down to "X said Y, so therefore Y".</p>

        <p>That’s what we must find, a reason for them to listen. It might be different reason for every person. But this is essential. We can not overcome this threat with only a small minority of the population being able to see what is happening. It just won’t work and we won’t like the outcome or be able to live(literally, by our choice or be theirs)with the results. I agree it’s pretty imperative that we show these people the way. We need the numbers. They have the money, they have the technology. But they still need people who believe they are helping the situation to bring their plan to fruition.</p>

        <p>Logic and reason are usually tied to emotions in almost everybody. So either way you have to speak to people on multiple levels - a combination of reason and an emotional appeal combined are probably best.</p>
<p>In the end, everyone has some reasons why they believe what they do - if those are uncovered through conversation, one can effectively express counter-arguments and move into an actual productive conversation.</p>

        <p>This is true, but from their perspective they are actually saving people's lives through trampling their rights. They believe trying to forcibly control people is the optimal way to help them.</p>
<p>They are of course wrong, but they don't know this, as they have been deluded that their actions are altruistic. </p>
<p>Basically, it's an incredibly powerful illusion created by the media and it taps into people's deepest drives, ranging from their desire to be safe, their altruistic tendencies, as well as in some, their authoritarian tendencies.</p>

        <p>Altruism is the principle and moral practice of concern for happiness of other human beings or other animals, resulting in a quality of life both material and spiritual.</p>
<p>I'm sorry they do not qualify. I've seen them and their actions over the last 18 months. I've observed second hand and first hand what they're willing to do, and being altruistic and caring is not there.</p>

        <p>You see that's the problem, many of them aren't at all dumb (in my experience, some are highly intelligent actually), just ignorant and easily led by authority. </p>
<p>They are also extremely trusting of authority, perhaps because they have not recognised their own capacity for evil, their shadows and thus believe no genuine evil exists in the world (they have rational intelligence, but little emotional intelligence). </p>
<p>On the other hand, they may likely also have emotional wounds that make it difficult for them to see the whole picture and not be reactive.</p>

        <p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_Generations?wprov=sfla1</p>
<p>I see a commonality between the pro jab do gooders of today and misguided policies of the past. The stolen generation is a prime example of misplaced altruism. While racist and heavy handed, these Australian policies were genuinely perceived to be beneficial to the Aboriginal people.  This mind set isn't unique or exclusive to white Europeans either. Today, China is making the same mistakes regarding the Uighur people.  There will always be groups who flock to "compassionate authority" with the belief they are making other people's lives better.</p>

        <p>Both really. </p>
<p>First you have to understand their perspective and put yourself in their shoes in order for them to be willing to listen to you and put themselves in your shoes. </p>
<p>You build rapport and then you discuss. In my experience that's the most successful approach - it's not foolproof, as nothing is, but IMHO it's the best way to go about it.</p>
