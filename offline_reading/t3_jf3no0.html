    <strong>Sickness, old age, and death are inevitable. This whole thing is a cultural problem of people trying to hide from what cannot be stopped.</strong>
    <p><p>I am sure to become old; I cannot avoid ageing.  </p>
<p>I am sure to become ill; I cannot avoid illness. </p>
<p>I am sure to die; I cannot avoid death.   </p>
<p>I am sure to be separated from all that is dear and beloved to me; I cannot avoid loss.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is from a classic buddhist reflection on sickness, old age, and death. If you actually do these death reflections frequently, a lot of the fear goes away and certainly the cultural accretion of deeming sickness, old age, and death to be "bad things" is counter-acted. One sees that they are entirely natural, to be accepted.</p>
<p>It is okay, everyone and everything will die. That is the way things are. Let us get the virus, no problem, sickness, old age, and death are inevitable. I am settled with them.</p>
<p>The more people have this calm, unagitated, wise relationship with sickness, old age, and death, the less power the fear-mongers have. The freer we become.</p>
<p>These reflections lead to freedom.</p></p>

        <p>Why do you think the most outspoken, brazen, short-sighted doomers, screeching about saving lives and incapable of accepting even a single death, are all young people, millennials and zoomers</p>
<p>The current generation entering adulthood is, relative to previous generations, so extraordinarily coddled and sheltered it isn't even funny.  They were raised by helicopter parents who never allowed them to experience failure, disappointment, loss, etc.  Their parents sorted out any trouble they ever got into.  They were never allowed to think for themselves, make their own decisions, or be responsible for their own actions, their own successes or conversely, their own fuck-ups.</p>
<p>They are also young enough that many have not necessarily experienced the loss of a family member or loved one, not even a grandparent.  They lack the experience, and thus, the emotional tools, to deal with death.</p>
<p>And now, they are being bombarded 24/7 with authoritarian orders (which they crave, because independence scares them), and the threat of someone near to them dying (which terrifies them, because until now they never considered loss of human life to even be a possibility in real life).</p>
<p>This is absolutely, 100% a cultural and societal issue.  At least here in the US, politics is still very much a popularity contest.  Democratic ~~governors~~ tyrants are only doing all this crazy bullshit because <em>it's what their voter base wants</em>.  Look, if every person in the country ripped off their mask and went back to work, there is absolutely nothing anyone could do.  If that happened the restrictions would be gone tomorrow.  You can't fine 328 million people.  You can't toss 328 million people in jail.  The only reason we're still in this mess is because people want to be in this mess.</p>

        <p>As a parent of young adults, I don’t think it’s helicopter parents as much as it is social media. It’s not always kids’ parents who discourage them from thinking for themselves, often it’s their teachers and their friends. Like all of us, they are preoccupied with being accepted, and that means having the right opinions. The difference these days is that they broadcast their self-censored opinions on social media and get rewarded with likes and echo chamber comments. Previous generations could quietly indulge their unpopular opinions in real-life conversations without their whole social circle knowing about it. That still happens to some degree, but you never hear about it. For the record, my kids, 19 and 22, are freethinkers, but they are quiet about it on social media and only venture their true opinions in front of people they are very secure with.</p>

        <p>Absolutely social media is a big part of the problem too.  I never joined twitter, but I feel like I get fucking brain cancer from screenshots I see and random tweets I get linked to from other places.  Facebook is obviously a cesspool.  I also don't really know about instagram (never joined it either), but I'm guessing now it's mostly plagued with virtue signaling bullshit like selfies with masks on.</p>
<p>I also didn't mean to imply that the <em>entire</em> generation was raised by overbearing, worry-wart helicopter parents,  just that it is the first generation where that sort of childhood environment is more widespread than a tiny number of fringe lunatics.   There has been an undeniable shift there and it absolutely shows, so many teenagers/20-somethings in the last ~10 years seem to be completely incapable of coming to grips with adulthood.  Thank you for raising your kids to be normal and responsible.</p>

        <p>I can attest to being raised this way, and it destroys a child.  </p>
<p>Imagine being told by a doctor that you'll need to be institutionalized and have someone wipe your ass for you, WHEN YOU ARE SIX YEARS OLD. When you go into school, get your ass beaten day to day and are constantly told it's all your fault, whether you did anything or not. Imagine being put on mind-altering drugs when you never needed them, only to find out years later that you would have fully healed without them.  </p>
<p>Imagine spending six years after high school, in complete isolation. Ending up with an addiction that ruined your mind and that you never wanted in the first place. Being cleaned out of the little money that you have through an SSI check you never wanted to get. Being abused by a gambling addict stepfather, when your mother divorces him for it.  </p>
<p>Then, when you finally get out into the real world and you start to realize, read about just how bad things are, you become paralyzed from the fear that was ALREADY PROGRAMMED INTO YOU.</p>

        <p>Exactly, OP.</p>
<p>&rt;and certainly the cultural accretion of deeming sickness, old age, and death to be "bad things"</p>
<p>At some point as a society, we seem to have internalized (I'm sure it was a gradual thing) this psychotic idea that sickness, aging and death are the worst possible things. Exactly in line with this discourse, the phrase <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori">memento mori</a> and the accompanying meditations were a thing for a very good reason.</p>

        <p>It’s not all that surprising. In America, we’ve had a long history of failing to come to terms with death. I think only like 25% of Americans die at home. Which is a really sad statistic because I don’t know anyone that wants to die in a hospital bed. </p>
<p>If these people ever had to perform CPR on a 95 year old with metastatic cancer and unable to feed themselves due to a prior stroke, they might begin to understand the absurdity of our medical system. </p>
<p>Overbearing covid policies are in some sense just an extension of this prolong-the-dying process-at-all-costs mentality. </p>

        <p>I have a 95 year old grandmother.  Last Christmas she told us “I’m not trying to be 100.”  Fucking depressing but I understand.  If this disease was killing 8 year olds, with a full life ahead of them, I would be willing to make the sacrifices asked of us right now.  I don’t think it’s fair to destroy the aspirations of multiple generations of people so that the elderly can avoid death for another few years.</p>

        <p>Exactly. Death is a natural part of life.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, the virus actually helped to eradicate the last remnants of death anxiety I had. I admit, I bought into the media panic back in march. I rarely follow news at all but this time there were some serious effects and restrictions being introduced to my daily life, so it had to be serious, right? I was super anxious and borderline psychotic in march-april, did everything I could to research about the virus (which lead to my skepticism. guess that's the reason why "doing your own research" is considered so dangerous) and then... I fully internalized and accepted that when I die, I die. I felt overwhelming sense of calm in my body and mind. I fully realized that fearing death is a terrible way to live. Life is short. Really fucking short. A lot shorter than you usually think and feel. The older you get, the quicker it goes by, especially if you settle into a routine.</p>
<p>On this topic, I recommend reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Brevitate_Vitae_%28Seneca%29">On the shortness of life</a>, by Seneca and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching">Tao te ching</a> by Laotsu (wikipedia links)</p>

        <p>Impermanence and suffering are reality. This cannot be escaped. The social engineers want to build a bubble. A fantasy world where they can trick people into believing that everything will be okay if you only trust and give your mind, body and soul over to the state and deny that which makes us human. No alarms and no surprises.</p>

        <p>My impression based on living in California is the opposite. Most people here do not seem concerned with mortality, and it almost feels like giving them far more credit than they deserve. </p>
<p>As I see it: one part loves the power, the bullying, the virtue signaling and the rabid anti-Trump aspect of it all.</p>
<p>The second group hates the mundane repetition of daily life and wants the fear. They might convince themselves and others that what they are feeling is mortal terror, but  they have become so detached from reality they've almost completely forgotten what that is. The subconscious part of our brains see through this - they make too many illogical exceptions to their supposedly life-saving habits to really be that scared.</p>
<p>The third just goes along to get along out of social fear. At least for now there is far more risk in going against the grain than their is in personal benefit for standing against the tide.  I generally consider it less selfish than it is about an instinct for survival, but others might differ. </p>
<p>A small, very small percentage of us are truly afraid because we can actually observe this happening in the people around us.</p>

        <p>We all age and die, but severe illness is not guaranteed. If you eat unprocessed, whole food vegan, never smoke, never drink, don't sleep around, plenty of sunshine and exercise, and the routine vaccines for deadly things like measles, your chances of becoming severely ill with anything is extremely, extremely low. On top of that, your aging will be much slower than most people and you have a very good chance of living to 100 years old with the added bonus of your mind and body fully functional and disease-free.</p>
<p>If the majority of people actually cared about staying healthy and avoiding death for as long as possible, they would do all these things, instead of wearing a mask or taking pills to suppress the symptoms of their self-caused diseases.</p>

        <p>If dying is inevitable then why are things like suicide a problem? Like you guys talk about mental  health issues caused by the virus then say everyone dies eventually, so why do the suicides matter? According to your own logic they don’t</p>

        <p>It's entirely from a different perspective than what I am saying in regards to these death reflections. These death reflections are tools for liberation, tools for inner freedom. They actually, when integrated into a whole practice of meditation and investigation, lead to an inner freedom and joy, enough internal space of happiness, that they are actually dissuasive to someone killing themselves, and moreover , not just dissuading people from killing themselves, they help people to live lives of joy, meaning, beauty, and peace.</p>
<p>You may press the question, "why do suicides matter", but this is something that helps people be free from suffering, something which we actually can be freed from.</p>
<p>We can never be free from sickness, old age, and death. We can be free from suffering. These reflections lead to that.</p>
