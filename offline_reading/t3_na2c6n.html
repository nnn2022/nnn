    <strong>College plans are ruined</strong>
    <p><p>Hi all, I wanted to share my story bc I'm pretty distraught right now and have very little people to turn to...
I was supposed to transfer to a SUNY school in the fall as a junior. I originally went to a private school,but took a leave of absence after being very unhappy with my major classes and the forced online education. I've been working in the meantime.
The private school and SUNY school are both local, because of mental health problems I suffer we didn't want me living on my own so I chose local schools so I could live at home still.
Where I live, there are literally no private local schools that offer a good program for my major. The SUNY school was the best bet by far, after seeing how shitty the private school I chose was.
Also, I want to note that online classes mentally fuck me up... Going only online makes me really fucking depressed and hopeless.
Now they just announced you can't attend any SUNY schools in person without getting vaccinated.
I don't know what I'm going to do, because I'm not going to get vaccinated just because everyone forces me to... But now my college plans are ruined and I'm at a loss.
Fuck authority, fuck Cuomo, fuck everyone trying to force me to do things to my body that I don't want. Ruining my life</p></p>

        <p>Any trade at this point is better than college debt, even if you're an engineer. The dream of "oh I'll just pay it off real fast" slips away pretty fucking fast after wife/house/kids come into the picture. At this point I make more than the electricians at work, sure, but they don't pay $500 a month in loans. May as well have just done that apprenticeship and I'd be where I am right now anyways without having wasted 4 years. 90% of graduates aren't near as lucky as I am financially either..</p>

        <p>Sorry that's happening. I just work as a janitor at a college and the students are mandatory jabs and employees are strongly encouraged and the legal team is looking if it need to be mandatory.
My days working are numbered. 
Just a idea but trade jobs are still strong and won't cost you your future. 
Take care.</p>

        <p>No shame if you decide to take the vaccine. Your mental health is important and so is your education. It’s wrong you’ve been put in this situation, but that is something you can’t control. You can only control how you react to the situation and you have to do what is best for you. Maybe research the concerns you have regarding the vaccine and see if that changes your decision. Or take a gap year and gain some work experience, even if that just means working retail. You can learn a lot of valuable skills at entry level jobs and they can provide a lot of perspective when you pursue a longer term career.</p>

        <p>This has been walked back. Because the vaccine is experimental, SUNY can not force you to be vaccinated. Once the vaccines become fully approved, then this rule will be in effect.</p>

        <p>Although it's unfortunately doubtful, you do have some hope. The mandate is contingent upon a vaccine being approved by the FDA, and there are already lawsuits in the works. Some think this is a bluff to have as many students as possible get vaccinated "voluntarily" before the school year starts.</p>

        <p>Interesting... I guess I shouldn't throw in the towel yet and should go ahead with the registration and all that, on the off chance it doesn't go through, Thanks!</p>
<p>And I was really thinking, do they plan on relying on students supplying those extremely unofficial little cardstock cards with no signatures or security features on them whatsoever? Seems like it's doomed to fail... we'll see what comes of it I guess.</p>

        <p>What are your real life plans after college? Are you going to college to just go to college? Really examine the reason you feel the need to go to college. Alot of classes in college are pointless and a way to get money out of students who have no choice but to take out immense sums of debt and pay up. You might be able to find a way to obtain what you want in life without college.
Remember: sometimes rejection is God's protection.</p>

        <p>My plans after college include "exist", "slave away at some job in the field"...</p>
<p>To be frank I'm going to college because my parents expect me to. I went into it because I thought I had to, now I'm halfway done and I fully realize what a fucking waste of time it is. Society really has this "if you don't go to college, you're a failure" attitude and public high schools just further push it into students' minds because someone decided that having higher percentages of students going to college (ie getting useless degrees and going into terrible debt) makes a high school look good.</p>
<p>At this point I'm practically only doing it for my parents. They're paying for it all anyway, I know I'm privileged and spoiled for that but honestly I think it's a waste... and I have no idea what the hell else I'm gonna do with my life.</p>
<p>Thanks for the insight, my friend, it's gotten me motivated for look for some other path</p>
