    <strong>My local mall quietly changed their mask signage.</strong>
    <p><p>Since the May mandate for masks in businesses here in VA the entrance of my local mall had signs saying "Masks are REQUIRED to enter".  Not everybody obeyed, including yours truly, but that was the language on the sign.</p>
<p>Then yesterday a subtle change had occurred. There are now signs where the old ones were that say "We request that you wear a mask while shopping. Thank you."</p>
<p>I know this isn't some earth-shattering policy 180, but it was encouraging. I don't know who changed it or why they felt compelled to do so, but at least in this small way I was able to observe a single step back from the "new normal".</p>
<p>I feel like sharing these little victories might help bolster morale. I know from various posts I've seen here and on LDS that there are a lot of people despairing and if I can share a glimmer of hope I will.</p></p>

        <p>I actually noticed something similar last week when shopping. A pre-recorded announcement that usually bleated on about wearing a mask had now added "unless you have a health condition that prevents you from doing so." </p>
<p>I could see some lawsuits from people with disabilities stemming for mask requirements.</p>

        <p>I think that there must be some lawsuits happening that we’re not hearing about, which is why they’re subtly changing their messages about masks.</p>

        <p>My local MPP in Ontario, who thinks all the regulations are overblown (Randy Hillier), is offering to help anyone who feels discriminated against (due to being medically exempt from wearing a mask) find a lawyer and file a suit. I think that Rocco Galati could be handling some lawsuits already, although I'm not sure.</p>

        <p>Randy Hillier is just a gem and is basically the only MPP talking about this.  He also has an active Twitter account I'm sure he posts to himself with lots of focus on covid 19 and the Canadian response to it. 
Wish he were my MPP!
Mine just responds back to me with strange cut and paste mismashes about flattening the curve that don't even reply to what I emailed about lol. But they kind of make me smile because you never hear anyone talk about flattening the curve anymore.</p>

        <p>Yes, I look at his Twitter all the time! It is authentically him, no doubt. I really appreciate what he's saying and doing about this situation, although I didn't know much about his political views before this, TBH.</p>

        <p>I wish I could do a lawsuit against my doctor's office. I was denied a medical treatment I've been getting for years by my doctor because I cannot wear a mask for an extended period of time, that they have a strick mask policy and will not allow anyone no matter what to come in their offices without a mask. </p>
<p>They told me the policy will not be lifted until the pandemic is over, conservatively next year! I live in Washington state.</p>

        <p>Went shopping at Home Depot a few times this week. </p>
<p>First day I pulled the mask down on my chin and shopped, no confrontation at all.</p>
<p>Second day I hung the mask off one ear and shopped, had my son with me (also maskless) and aside from a lone Karen customer who tried asking how old he was (and got told to MYOB) no confrontation.</p>
<p>So today I just put the mask in my pocket, and shopped like it was any other day. With my son too. No issues.</p>
<p>I'm from NJ, epicenter of Lockdown stupidity. Small victories count. There will be no "new normal" for me.</p>

        <p>i really hate it here right now, and the only reason my husband and i are staying is because of my job. and my parents. </p>
<p>but my god is this place miserable. at least before this, Northern Virginia had something going for it. great restaurants, close to DC for entertainment and sports and culture and music and people, great public schools, semi-functional public transit, three big international airports, interesting people...</p>
<p>now, i feel like i live in East Germany. i would like to return my free trial of socialism now, please. i'm tired of bare shelves at the grocery store and closing small family restaurants, and i'm tired of wearing a menstrual pad on my face and being reminded to stay six feet away from other people at all times. it's fucking depressing. </p>

        <p>Richmond. The city is full of masks. The suburbs are a blend but mostly masked and anywhere outside of Richmond/Chesterfield/Henrico is a crapshoot of people wearing or not.</p>
<p>It also depends on the setting. Grocery store or Costco? Masks.  Convenience store or strip-mall? Blend of masks and not masked.</p>

<p>Like,  bruh. Nobody told you you needed to do that. Take that mask off before you kill yourself. </p>
<p>On a brighter note i picnicked on the grounds of the VMFA yesterday for dinner and it was super chill.  Groups of young people without masks hanging out with their friends and surreptitious booze drinks.</p>

        <p>We still have the mask mandate in retail stores, but the big sign that warns you about wearing a mask etc. that blocks the entrance-way to the park keeps getting kicked down (not by me). So we've got that going for us, which is nice.</p>

<p>But there’s a small town diner that is mad as hell about it, and their sign is vicious. I can’t remember all if it, but on the bottom it says: “questions or complaints?

I’ve been road tripping around the west (not the coastal states, the next ones inland) and I’m not exaggerating, I haven’t worn a mask in a week now and I’ve been in dozens of businesses.

        <p>It’s just so crazy to me how <em>vastly</em> different states are right now, sometimes right next to each other, like NH for example. I live in LA which we all know is one of the worst places right now, with the majority of places still shut down. But I’ve been road tripping all summer and I’m currently in Utah where not only has everything been open since like May, but with absolutely no mask requirements either! Even gyms and movie theaters, which people in CA could only dream about right now. It’s just remarkable. I feel like most people in these lock down states are in such a bubble that they don’t even realize that there are actually large parts of the country that are (and have been for months) completely open and mostly normal.</p>

        <p>Exactly. It's even more incredible when these are bubbles are more localized. I was in New York City last Friday and Manhattan and even parts of Brooklyn that are closer to Manhattan are full of doomers and every single person wearing masks, even outside etc. But once I got to farther areas of Brooklyn like Sheepshead Bay and Brighton Beach, it was so much more lax. About 30% of all people outside had masks, businesses had signs that said "no mask no service" but not a single person had a mask inside (not even workers). It's just all so ridiculously ideologically inconsistent - if one state is too restrictive, people will just naturally go to another state to do what they want to. It shows to me the natural desire for people to be free, even if they continue to preach for restrictions (I personally know people who themselves crossed state lines to do what they want to despite supporting COVID measures). I'm in rural Ohio right now for school, and I can tell that all the county locals absolutely loathe the measures the progressive morons who run the town (elected by more morons in the student body).</p>

        <p>sign change has nothing to do with masks being any less important.<br>
it's because employees get more trouble trying to enforce masks,<br>
so they have changed their strategy from bad cop to good cop.<br>
a few indoor spaces may have used the past few months to modify<br>
their indoor ventilation systems to be more covid safe for customers<br>
but you can't really depend on that alone - either. <br>
the "new normal" indoors must be mask&amp;distance -OR- test&amp;trace,<br>
and since 'merica can't stomach being traced, they gotta mask up.</p>
