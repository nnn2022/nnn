    <strong>Rise of the Vaccinazis</strong>
    <p><p>Like it or not, history is repeating itself. Many vaxxed people have become hostile and belligerent to those who aren't.They're angry that they took the shot and others didn't or will never. They want to segregate, and create a second class of citizen, punish, maybe round up, or force vaccinations. Make them mandatory or force people to wear a mask including kids.  </p>
<p>They have already dehumanized millions of people, they already think anyone who didn't take it are anti Vax  Qanon Conspiracy Theorists who vote for Trump.   They have the motivation and believe they have the moral authority and justification. I call these people Vaccinazis. All of the mechanisms are in place, power, corporate, digital just as good if not better than Hitler, save for the gas chambers...maybe.</p></p>

        <p>Ill never take these demonic Mark of the Beast shots. I’m sad but I’m prepared to die. What I’m worried is that the Vaccinazis will pick us off one home at a time. I feel protests aren’t getting enough media attention, which is hurting on getting the message out. If only there was one decent person on the inside of this diabolical scheme to pull the curtain on this charade and show the whole world what’s really happening.</p>

        <p>Agreed. These monsters have threatened our lives &amp; livelihoods, as well as created a tsunami of unimaginable pain &amp; suffering both physical harm (leading to death in many cases from not just the vaccines but postponed cancer treatments or other ailments) as well as extreme mental anguish &amp; damage (which also leads to suicide). Before they’re all executed I want to ask questions of who ordered them to do this, as I feel we really need to get to the bottom of all of this, or otherwise if we don’t squeeze out all the info/secrets from them then this whole situation will just repeat itself for the next or next-next generation after us. History will repeat itself and we’re already seeing it now. Examples I can think of are how the Jews were treated by the Nazis, or during the Bolshevik Revolution, or perhaps during the Weimar atrocities.</p>

        <p>Bullshit. If you did and didn't suffer any reactions (pain, soreness, joint/muscle cramps) then you either got a saline placebo (more and more are reporting about this) or you're just straight-up lying to me as well as being a total jerk &amp; troll to this community. Fucking hypocrite. If you're telling me the truth then you won't mind if I personally give you my two doses, right? Or why not take on everyone's if you think that'll protect you. Jesus...</p>

        <p>Again, based on your post history, there's absolutely no fucking way I'd believe you. As for taking more doses, the point was that if you're so confident then take more to protect yourself. In the coming months the government is going to announce booster shots, as well as yearly shots. This nightmare will never end because people like yourself refuse to listen to us. All you do is mock, belittle, shame and have ill-will towards us. And some have wished me and my friends death. Please don't visit our subreddit if your intention is only negative or harmful.

        <p>I'm not even religious. But I now see why many people had mentioned about "Mark of the Beast". 
I've had shots for things like Polio, Measles, Chicken Pocks, etc., but never have I seen such a push from all levels of government and media for all of us to take these rushed out vaccines. 
Honest question, since you like bothering us in this subreddit, do you not see any of the posts that discuss about those who have suffered death or permanent vaccine injury from Pfizer, Moderna, AZ or J&amp;J? Or are you just willfully dismissive of such posts because it didn't happen to you?</p>

<p>The fact is that anyone can post anything on the internet and it doesn’t have to be true. Even if it is true, there’s no way to verify a connection with a vaccine without more data.</p>

        <p>I try to keep in mind how many of these “people” are shills and bots. I also try to ‘remember the human’, that people are scared because their minds have been primed and programmed for this moment in time for decades. This isn’t their fault, they’ve drifted through life wearing rose-tinted glasses because they’ve been lullabied into thinking the powers-that-be have their best interests at heart, even when their eyes tell them that’s a lie. I go through days where I think “fuck it, they deserve what they get”, but then I realize that’s exactly where ‘They’ want us- to get pissed and give up so they They have unobstructed access to their minds. If we were wrong, they wouldn’t be trying so hard to silence us- <em>and actual medical experts</em>- for a virus that is 99.8% recoverable for the majority, and treatable with <a href="https://imgur.com/a/A20KTWO">medications</a> that have been on the market and proven safe for decades.</p>

        <p>It’s terrifying because this is just the becoming. Akin to nazi Germany in the 1930’s. </p>
<p>Everyone knows about what happened 1939-1945 but few realize just how bad it got in the 2 decades prior. </p>
<p>As with many things in life it’s a long, gradual game they play. Wait... we saw this. </p>
<p>2 weeks flatten curve. 2 more. One more month. Another season. Until the vaccine. Vaccine passports. </p>
<p>I am hopeful for a turn around and better future but preparing for the worst. </p>
<p>What is even more terrifying this time is this is nearly the entire world locking down and mind controlled (or the elites are all working together now and have successfully gotten control of nearly all nations).</p>

        <p>There's more in store and there's really nothing we can do, except know and be prepared. I was just speaking with my wife about how crazy it seems things are headed and how they can basically "plug the plug" on these people by simply announcing herd immunity before its way too late. But that's what they want, complete madness and disorder amongst the people.</p>

        <p>I have found that if you stay off the internet none of the division they are creating is very real.  I was in California recently and that place is still a nightmare in the cities but in most other places we need to just go about our lives. Politely refuse to comply, support business that is human friendly and chat with our neighbors.  Don’t patronize the places that treat humans as biological threats, don’t engage with the Covid religious zealots.  </p>
<p>All out enemies wear suits and direct talking heads on TV and political figureheads to create division hatred fear, pollute science, brainwash and program religious zealotry around their narratives. Direct energy there. Most of these Covinazis you speak of are victims of the same folks, just in a more unconscious way.</p>
