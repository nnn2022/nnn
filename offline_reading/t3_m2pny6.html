    <strong>Lockdowns caused political and economic destabilization for nothing</strong>
    <p><p>As Brazil now is the ugly duck of the covid crisis, I have to say some comments about our neighbors.</p>
<p>Lockdowns caused severe economic damage to the point of destabilizing Latin America and they have achieved nothing. We have one of the highest mortality rates in the world even with countries like Peru decreeing state of exception and putting the army to enforce curfews.</p>
<p>And now we have inflation, economic depression, explosive poverty and political chaos.</p>
<p>Just look at the neighbors. Peru (the harshest lockdown in the world and the highest excess mortality in Latin America) is in on the third president in 1 year with a gdp loss of more than 10%, Argentina is in chaos with high inflation an a fall in 10% of GDP with protests (banderazos). Chile (another harsh lockdown that had even more strict rules than France) had a referendum on the constitution, there are frequent riots and they burned down one of Santiagos most important churches.</p>
<p>Today, there are prostests in Paraguay demanding the resignation of President Mario Abo Benitez.</p>
<p>Bolsonaro escaped most of it, says lockdowns are useless and has the fastest vaccination program in Latin America. Brazil had the lowest gdp loss of latin América, 4 %, and we dont have riots on the street.</p></p>

        <p>Nothing?  I respectfully submit that the economic and political damage was intentional.  Create chaos to institute order according to a new set of rules.</p>
<p>Never waste a good crisis.</p>

        <p>In Brazil, the most doomer press that always does the most fear mongering on covid and calls for a military enforced lockdown is the one that hates Bolsonaro the most. MSM always had a derangement with Bolsonaro that sometimes it looks stupid</p>
<p>Because they know that a massive economic disaster would result in destabilization that could take out Bolsonaro like happened with Martin vizcarra, the president of Peru that got impeached and the vice, Manuel merino, who resigned 1 week later. The actual president, Francisco Sagasti, is a substitute elected by congress.</p>

        <p>I had a friend who lived in Peru. She moved there in December of 2019. It was great at the start. They had a condo overlooking the ocean and they loved going out to the shops and restaurants. Then the scam hit. Full lockdowns on Sundays. Every other day only women could leave the house for supplies and the other day only men. Her husband worked in an ambassador role for the US. She doesn’t speak fluent Spanish so she never went out alone. Nightly sirens for curfew, troops roaming the streets, and protesters and police clashing nightly. I don’t remember seeing this on the news.</p>
