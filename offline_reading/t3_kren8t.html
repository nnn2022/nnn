        <p>Me slight fever 99.4 terrible headache and stiff neck for 24 hrs. </p>

<p>Important to note we all take elderberry, vitamin C, and zinc. Workout 6 days a week and spend as much time outdoors in the fresh air and sun as possible. I think our lifestyle and food choices had a big impact</p>

        <p>You are correct. It seems that these new fake Covid rules have seeped into my brain. Their school and day care wonâ€™t let them attend if their body temperature is above 99.4. It used to be 100.4 They would send them home. Now they take their temperature before they walk in. </p>
<p>You sound like my husband with the ginger LOL he chews on ginger root all the time Iâ€™m not so good with it I will eat the thinly sliced stuff after sushi ðŸ˜† We have a lot of weird stuff in our diet like a mushroom protein shake every morning and coconut charcoal. (David Wolfe) The ones I listed above were the ones I thought were most important in helping us.</p>

        <p>Yeah, they have convinced people that just being human is a symptom. I have to remind a lot of people that it isn't a fever. Also, that they didn't test positive for Covid, but Coronavirus antibodies. Unless a sample was cultured, isolated and tested for live virus, they didn't test positive for Covid. </p>
<p>Ginger is tough to get used to. I boil it in water and then make tea with it or put some in soup with garlic and turmeric. It has kept me from not getting sick for 20 years.</p>

        <p>I do drink Ginger and turmeric tea from time to time.  It helped me kick my coffee habit. Yeah I just assume the test tested positive because we all have the same strain of cold.
My husband constantly reminds me that they have not isolated the virus or something like that.</p>
<p>But the thing that I cannot wrap my head around, is that my mom got it and her only symptom was loss of smell. 
Now my mom doesnâ€™t watch TV she just got Internet like a month ago so I donâ€™t think it was the propaganda being pushed in her head. Making her brain think thatâ€™s a symptom. Her husband had a flu like symptoms with a positive test. My mom had absolutely no symptoms but she said she could not smell anything. She would put enough perfume on her wrist where it was saturated and she still could not smell it. she said it was the weirdest thing sheâ€™s ever experienced.</p>

        <p>Well, loosing sense of smell is common even for people with just allergies. It's one of those things we just don't pay much attention to normally. Now since every bodily function is under a microscope, we are more aware of things we previously weren't. It's pretty normal. Just like if you buy a certain car, you now notice how many of the same car are on the road.</p>

        <p>My husband and I both had it early December. It was similar to a bad cold. I was sick about 6 days, with the last day having 103.5 fever. Very sinusy, terrible headache, my eyes hurt, lost taste and smell and I was insanely tired for the whole month of December but especially that first week of being sick. Glad I got it over with and by the time I had it I was pissed at how much work I lost last year for a bad cold. I took Nagella Sativa, Vitamin D and Mucinex D while I was sick. I think the Nagella Sativa really cut down my sick time [there was a Pakistan study that showed this] since my husband was sick closer to 10 days. I think covid is a thing for sure, it was a weird ride, but completely overblown and not serious unless you're already very unhealthy.</p>

        <p>I had very weird physical symptoms in a third world country: almost exclusively respiratory, lots of phlegm, I couldn't do anything about except cough to mvoe it around in an impotent sorta fashion. If I crossed the road (polluted shithole city) I felt like I was going to pass out. I know the air quality is quite bad in the city I was in, but it couldn't have accounted for the nasty weird blackout feeling I had.  Took me weeks for it to finally fuck off. I was living rough though at the time, so I'm not sure.</p>
