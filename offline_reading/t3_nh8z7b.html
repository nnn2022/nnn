    <p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed schools around the country to adopt and rely heavily on new technology. But a <a href="https://me2ba.org/school-mobile-apps-student-data-sharing-behavior/">study</a> published today from the nonprofit Me2b Alliance suggests that these tools might be syphoning children’s’ data and sending them to advertisers like Google and Facebook without informing users or parents.</p>
<p>The group audited a random sample of 73 apps from 38 schools in 14 states across the country, and found that 60% of these apps were sending student data to a variety of third parties. Roughly half of the apps were sending student data to Google, while 14% were sending data to Facebook. On average, there were 10.6 third-party data channels per app.</p>
<p>The study evaluated these apps by examining software development kits, or SDKs, which provide developers with pre-packaged code modules. SDKs generally run behind-the-scenes as soon as someone opens the app, and users are rarely asked for consent before an SDK sends data back to its third-party developer. SDK providers use the data for a variety of reasons, including performing vital app functions, collecting analytics, advertising, and monetization.</p>
<p>The study identified 56 unique SDKs used by the apps, most of which were owned by recognizable tech companies like Google (12), Facebook (7), Apple (7), Amazon (3), Square (3), and Twitter (2). 100% of the Android apps that included SDKs sent data to Google, the report found.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of schools that have their own custom apps, and they’re leaning on these apps more because of the pandemic,” said Zach Edwards, who is in charge of data integrity testing for the Me2b Alliance. “We realized they don’t seem to have internal standards to remove advertising SDKs from these apps. As soon as we dipped our toes into it we realized it was a deeply problematic trend across the board.”</p>
<p>The group characterized SDKs based on their function—from medium-risk for SDKs that were designed for utility purposes to very high-risk for SDKs that were designed for advertising and monetization and routinely sync with hundreds of partners to track users across services and devices.</p>
