        <p>My god is it that hard to wear a sheet of cloth. If you don't like it, tough. How is a fucking mask going to control the people. There is nothing they can exploit from it. Even if you do not think they work, just wear it anyways. If there is a chance it will save a person's life, its better to take that chance. I also swear to god everyone on this subreddit always screams "vIRtUe SiGNallinG" whenever they see a remotely happy photo of people with masks on.</p>
<p>Since there is a timer for every comment here, I may as well add something. Do you think it was little timmy's idea to take this photo? No, no it wasnt. Do you think little jessica said "Parents, I wish to propose a family photo in which we will distribute it across the world wide internet to control masses of people into wearing a mask."? No, no she didnt. Sure, the image is supposed to show that everyone in your family can be safe and happy with a mask on. But you are being irrational here. Grow a pair of socks and wear a mask for 10 god damn minutes while you order a happy meal. If you cannot handle "your face sweating and becoming an oven", just remember you weren't complaining when surgeons had to wear those masks for 10 hours.</p>
<p>If you are getting this mad at a happy family you need to reconsider whatever the fuck you are doing.</p>

        <p>Wear your slave mask with pride, but it is sick and evil to force people to struggle to breathe - as many do in a mask, even if it feels like no big deal to you, to breathe mask fibers into their lungs all day every day, and to breathe in the pathogens (bacteria, viruses, fungi, and yeast) that accumulate on these masks all day.</p>
<p>No one's exploiting these masks? Ordering billions of people around the world to wear disposable masks all day, every day? Some people are making a fortune selling them and no doubt some of those mandating them are making a nice commission.</p>
<p>Not everyone wears a mask for 10 minutes ordering a Happy Meal. The employee selling you the happy meal is forced to wear it 8 hours a day, plus possibly two more if he commutes via public transportation. How dare you make light of this person's suffering?</p>
<p>Surgeons almost never wear masks all day long. They wear them for the duration of surgeries they are performing, with breaks in between. (And it's even controversial whether this does more harm than good, due to pathogens that collect on their masks.) More importantly, surgeons CHOSE their profession. If they struggled to breathe in a mask, they could have chosen another profession.</p>

        <p>Alr since you responded with an essay and I am time short I'll respond with only a few sentences.</p>
<p>1) Yes, people are making business from these masks. Same with fidget spinners, yet you arent considering them "the government trying to bankrupt the working class" because people will make business of things. Way stuff is.</p>
<p>2) Majority of people, including myself, can breathe in masks just fine, for a decent amount of time. Maybe an hour or a few depending on ventilation. It doesnt strangle your throat, and no it isnt loose. Wear the mask for a few hours a day with breaks in between for a couple more months you wont have to complain about this ever again. I dont really like masks, but a lot of people are not bothered. If someone does struggle to breathe in a mask at work, they should talk to the person in charge. It is a sheet of cloth over your mouth, it is not designed to strangle people. If it was, they would have gone for thicker masks or put in less holes.</p>
<p>3) So you are going to apply breaks and that to surgeons, yet in your second paragraph you completely ignore it? It doesnt matter if they choose their professions, it doesnt mean they wont be bothered by the masks. Yet they arent. I get it, not everyone has the same set of lungs but you gotta bare through for a few more months.</p>

        <p>You don't seem to be able to distinguish between free choice and force. One is freedom, the other is slavery.</p>
<p>No one is forcing people to buy fidget spinners. The government is forcing people to buy masks that need to be regularly replaced by the millions in the US. There are credible rumors that some of the people responsible for pushing these mask mandates are in bed with the mask manufacturers and making money on this deal. They are not concerned about our health but how much they can rake in.</p>
<p>If you are one of the many people who struggles to breathe wearing a mask, it doesn't really help you to hear that the majority find it to be no big deal. Masks should never be mandated, as no one should be forced to struggle to breathe. This is especially the case since it has been shown, in studies and in real life, that masks don't stop or even slow down the transmission of the virus.</p>
<p>You tell people to wear the masks a few hours a day for a couple of more months. That doesn't help the person struggling to breathe for 8 hours a day at work and 2 more hours on the train commuting.</p>
<p>There's also no guarantee the mask mandates will be dropped in a few months. We were also told, "Just two weeks of lockdowns to slow the spread," and that turned into a year of lockdowns followed by partial lockdowns, where businesses are forced to operate at 10-50% capacity, often at a loss. Mask mandates aren't about health, but about control and teaching the people to submit. Some in government are never going to reverse the mask mandates in their jurisdictions until and unless they are forced to.</p>
<p>You miss the point that surgeons CHOOSE a profession that requires a mask to be worn during surgery. If someone wanted to be a surgeon and realized they felt like they were suffocating when wearing a surgical mask, they could CHOOSE a different profession. They are not mandated to become surgeons.</p>
