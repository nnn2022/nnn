    <strong>It’s like speaking to a wall.</strong>
    <p><p>This whole coronavirus catastrophe is really starting to do a number on my sanity. At this point, if people can’t see how we’re all
being played by this coronavirus response, they’re either 1) Incapable of formulating a proper reality and can’t think for themselves 2) Purposefully trying to mislead others for the sake of their argument 3) The epitome of just plain unintelligent. </p>
<p>I gave up trying to argue over a Reddit a while ago. It’s impossible. I’m in many subreddits that are for my personal interests. Reddit was supposed to be, for me, a place to come and read about my hobbies, see things to do, etc. I guess it still could be that, but especially in subs that are geographically influenced (like my university sub, or my town’s sub), it’s just become overrun with COVIDiots. The people in the subs have just collectively dismissed all notions of skepticism. If you asked them to name one thing that we’ve done wrong or not enough of during this catastrophe, they wouldn’t be able to name anything. They’d say we needed <em>even more</em> government involved. But, of course, I never got that far to ask. I get downvoted into oblivion or receive personal attacks before I can even get my first or second thoughts established. It’s such a toxic environment, it really drives home that people really don’t give a shit what you think, despite many saying they’re pro-mental health. I want to work with these people, I don’t see anyone as my enemy. As Jo Jorgensen put it, we are all much more alike than we are different. But all they seem to want to do is verbally abuse you and label you as a murderer and a moron for even expressing an ounce of skepticism. </p>
<p>We’ve fallen into such a deep trance of groupthink, and it’s near impossible to break. To keep my sanity, I talk to my roommate about this stuff, who’s on the same page as me, but I just miss normal. I miss seeing people outside to smile to. I feel so isolated from nothing. I never really was a social butterfly, and I’m talking to all my friends still, but it just seems so different and depressing to know that there is nobody here on campus, except just those that need to be here. I walk to class and see no other students the whole way. It’s just sad, and completely unnecessary. I said earlier I don’t like to argue on Reddit anymore, it’s pretty much impossible to convince anyone if anything on Reddit, but often I forget this and engage. See <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ohiouniversity/comments/ijfc5t/do_you_think_we_will_return_for_phase_2/g3e37te/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">here</a>. This is my university subreddit. I try, I really do, to stay respectful and stick to facts, but all I get are downvotes, from people who don’t even bother to say what’s on their mind. These people, are, in a way, worse than those who engage. They’re the ones who are the sheep, the ones who don’t have anything to say because they don’t know what to say, they just think that way because they think that’s what’s expected of them. But with the one redditor who did engage, all I saw were wildly exaggerated claims presented as fact, and classic follower motivations like “even if you don’t agree, the university/government will do it anyway”. Well, sorry, but just because they’re doing something doesn’t mean they’re right to be doing it. But they don’t get this. It’s a fundamental disconnect, people just trust authority way too much, and I agree, authority should probably exist in some form, but government is far too corrupt to be that authority in the vast majority of circumstances. But I can never get this far in a discussion, before being downvoted into silence or being denounced as a murderer, anti-science, or Trumpist. </p>
<p>That’s it. Just wanted to get my thoughts out. I see encouraging posts about the future, how companies have loosened their restrictions, and they are good to see, but I’m pessimistic on the future. We have no freedom, we have no rights. We’ve been reconditioned to view free human will as selfish, and we are all collectively the government’s bitch. Any of our rights or freedom is just what the government deemed was appropriate, which is the exact opposite of what the founders intended and what is morally right. It’s just so depressing, how a year ago, everything was so normal, it even seemed perfect compared to now. Sigh.</p></p>

        <p>I also believe one option is they are willingly participating in the great reset. I believe after talking to a certain family member (I don’t agree with) I get the feeling they know the COVID wasn’t bad but want this global unity thinking it will be better for humanity, which scares me, and they also absolutely back wearing masks indefinitely in public like an article of clothing. Nothing I say to this person matters so all I can do at this point is laugh at them. I’m still just in awe of the mindset and a little scared.</p>

        <p>There are some who definitely support the Great Reset, and are hoping this changes humanity forever (into a more "utopian" society). I think most, however, are just gullible, naive, and ignorant of what's to come and how much modern life will change.</p>

        <p>Historian, tell me, what great reset? From neoliberal capitalism to another 1930s? The only reset you are going to have are civil war, dictatorship and explosive unemployment.</p>
<p>A brazilian thinker, Luis Ponde, however, is completely skeptical of these resets. As soon as it is possible, according to him, we will resume to normal and will not remeber anything we did, because this is what happened in similar situations in history.</p>

        <p>I hate it. My own mother listens to the NYT more than me, and shoots me down whenever I try to bring up my perspective and concerns. It must be hard to have propaganda drilled into you 24/7. But what the fuck. This pandemic has brought out an intense selfishness and gullibility of way too many people that I love and have known my whole life. No one uses real scientific figures when I talk to them. No one is themselves. I’ve realized it’ll probably ultimately take more fear tactics in the other direction to make any difference.</p>
<p>I just don’t get why we can’t at least be listened to.</p>

        <p>So I am someone who believes masks are most likely helpful but I am reading through this section of reddit with an open mind because I care more about real data than opinions. I think you have a lot of good points. It's really not good to listen to authority and believe them just because they're an authority.</p>
<p>I wish we could come up with a way to protect the most vulnerable while allowing those who don't want to worry about it to not need to. In an ideal world, there would be a way to do that.</p>
<p>Personally I don't care if I get it or not, and I'm not worried about my friends getting it, but I don't want my elderly mother to get it.</p>
<p>And I even agree that what my family and I should do is make it so she can quarantine and we talk to her on skype etc while the rest of us live our lives.</p>
<p>One thing that I think is a bit dramatic though is people saying we are going to have to wear masks for the rest of our lives. That is a very dramatic thing to say lol and extremely extremely unlikely.</p>
<p>Also I agree that lockdowns are harmful to the economy.</p>
<p>Personally I think if everyone would just agree to try wearing a mask for 30 days just to see what happens, then at least we would have real data to analyze. However I do understand the fear that if we do that, and it works, then what?</p>
<p>That'll never happen anyway, because it'll be impossible to get 100% of people to do that. So until we come up with a better solution, we're stuck in this divisive war where no one will ever be able to figure out what works and what doesn't.</p>
<p>If we could take all the elderly people and make an entire state a 55+ state, that'd be awesome haha. Like basically split up the vulnerable people into one part of the country and the rest to the other part of the country.</p>

        <p>&rt;Incapable of formulating a proper reality and can’t think for themselves </p>
<p>This 100%, sums it up perfectly. Even when I walk people through it step by step, <em>and they agree with each point along the way</em>, they still get reset onto the same track of unquestioning obedience above all else. I think some people might be literally beyond saving at this point. </p>
<p>Their reality is what <em>they're told</em> reality is.</p>
<p>I declined a request to travel across the country, saying that once I can <strong>old-normal</strong> travel, then I will. They went so far as to suggest that <em>it is normal now</em>, in the same sentence as saying they were compelled to wear a mask during x, y or z activity during their last travel.</p>
<p>There's no doubt that great efforts are being made to normalize what is happening, hence the "new normal" advertising/brainwashing campaign. Unfortunately, it works on a great many people. What an absolute mindfuck.</p>
