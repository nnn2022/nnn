<p>“As listeners to my <a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/interview-1563-keith-knight-and-james-corbett-dissect-voluntary-servitude/"><strong>recent podcast</strong></a> with Keith Knight of <strong>Don't Tread on Anyone</strong> will know, the secret weapon has been around for at least five centuries now, articulated with grace, style and concision by Étienne de La Boétie in his 16th century treatise, <a href="https://mises.org/library/politics-obedience-discourse-voluntary-servitude"><strong><em>The Politics of Obedience: The Discourse of Voluntary Servitude</em></strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Obviously there is no need of fighting to overcome this single tyrant, for he is automatically defeated if the country refuses consent to its own enslavement: it is not necessary to deprive him of anything but simply to give him nothing; there is no need that the country make an effort to do anything for itself provided it does nothing against itself. It is therefore the inhabitants themselves who permit, or, rather, bring about, their own subjection, since by ceasing to submit they would put an end to their servitude.</strong></p>
<p>This wisdom was rediscovered in the 19th century by Henry David Thoreau in his classic work on <a href="http://xroads.virginia.edu/~Hyper2/thoreau/civil.html"><strong><em>Civil Disobedience</em></strong></a>.</p>
<p>"A minority is powerless while it conforms to the majority; it is not even a minority then; but it is irresistible when it clogs by its whole weight. If the alternative is to keep all just men in prison, or give up war and slavery, the State will not hesitate which to choose. If a thousand men were not to pay their tax-bills this year, that would not be a violent and bloody measure, as it would be to pay them, and enable the State to commit violence and shed innocent blood. This is, in fact, the definition of a peaceable revolution, if any such is possible. If the tax-gatherer, or any other public officer, asks me, as one has done, "But what shall I do?" my answer is, "If you really wish to do anything, resign your office." When the subject has refused allegiance, and the officer has resigned his office, then the revolution is accomplished."</p></p>

<p>How simple it all seems. Stop believing and participating in evil and evil ceases to flourish. Surely, in light of the totalitarian encroachment, the numbers of COVID skeptics and infidels must now be growing. Keep talking to everyone, keep strong and keep up the good fight. Whether or not we are on the right side of history, we are right.</p>
