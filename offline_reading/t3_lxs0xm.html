    <strong>Dutch nursing homes give more freedom to vaccinated elderly</strong>
    <p><p>We already knew this was going to happen, today in the news that in the Netherlands, the 'Outbreak Management Team' (they advice the government) say that vaccinated elderly in nursing homes (the ones who did not die from the vaccine) get more freedom back. They are allowed to get 2 visitors per day instead of one. Of course the rest of us, is not allowed to have more than one visitor per day. </p>
<p>Clearly that our government (they always follow the advice from the Outbreak Management Team) steers towards more freedom for those who have been vaccinated.</p></p>
