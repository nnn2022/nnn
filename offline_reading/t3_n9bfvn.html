        <p>CDC says Covid is airborn, students are getting suspended from college for not wearing a mask outdoors off school property, were told to stay 6 feet apart, wear masks, discouraged from hugging. Covid is not just oral too (though there is still oral sex in porn despite it) it is spread through surface contact.
Sex so called "workers" such as prostitutes in Nevada will sue and claim discrimination, but its not discrimination, this industry involves the most physical contact, so go online have pay per view solo strip shows, everyone else is forced online, such as venues like bars in NYC who used to have live musicians. Allowing a close physical contact industry to operate is a double standard, (I know the new world order wants to spread the lowest forms of sleaze as a distraction while discouraging real meaningful human interaction akin to George Orwells 1984) but you cant make this out to be like Ebola and the Black Plague then have pornsites and brothels operating!
At first before the vaccine came out (which they say wont stop the spread and we still need to mask social distance and these people arent wearing masks during sex or social distancing) 
they were saying, if asked, they were getting covid tests weekly, first off thats a waste of a limited supply of tests, secondly if youre having sex with 20 people a day or week, then one test every Friday aint gonna stop the spread Sat through the upcoming Thurs...so what the hell?! And then while people are going wild selling their bodies and porking prostitutes Im supposed to take this plandemic seriously? Be scared? Take a shot?
Oh the irony! Theyll claim noone in the sex industry contacted covid 19 or died from it, well then noone wearing masks standing 10 feet apart did either, youre lying. Im fed up with their lies and smut while we are confined to a life of maddening solitude.</p>
