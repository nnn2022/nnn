    <strong>Will your job be mandating the COVID vaccine for all employees?</strong>
    <p><p>I am not looking to turn this into a post full of brigaders or anything like that.  I am 26 years old and unemployed at the moment, have been since January.  I know for a fact that if my previous company had stayed open (they closed down), the vaccine would not have been mandated for employees.  Even when we opened back up in June of 2020, there were zero masks or social distancing in the office, so I can’t imagine them suddenly caring that much once the vaccines became mainstream.</p>
<p>However, being that I live in a very blue state, I am anticipating that the vaccine will be mandated at whichever company I enter next.  I work in marketing, and there’s no way that young, hipster marketing agencies and other well-established companies don’t mandate it.  I think it’ll be pretty black-or-white too.  Maybe they’ll consider medical or religious exemptions, but I don’t think it will be like healthcare settings, where you can simply elect to wear a mask or get tested daily on premises rather than get the shot, that type of scenario.  Either you get the vaccine and provide proof of immunity, or you don’t have a job.  </p>
<p>It’s crazy how last year, I was called a conspiracy theorist for saying this will happen, but I was right and the skeptics were wrong.  And technically it’s illegal, but what’s legal, and what’s right doesn’t matter anymore.  It’s just “safety first,” even if that means violating numerous ethical codes and violating people’s personal choice.</p>
<p>I would move to Florida or Texas, but I’m pretty sure privately run companies there do have that right also.  And then the vaccine would be mandated to fly back north and visit anyway, so it’s not like the way of life down there would really be an escape.  Anyway, I’m curious as to your experiences, so I know what to expect when I re-enter the workforce.  I pretty much know the answer, and I’ve honestly made my peace with it at this point, but it’s still outrageous and disgusting, and really makes me ashamed of what’s happened to this once-great country.  What state are you in, and what industry?</p></p>
