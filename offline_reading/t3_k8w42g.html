<title>Could it be that all those ridiculous dire effects news was saying (hair loss, teeth fall out, etc) was not about the virus but about the vaccine? This way they can point back and blame it on covid</title>

    <p><p>Its pretty obvious NO ONE has any idea what the side effects of these experimental dna altering vaccines will be. So i think they just took all the imaginably bad shit that can happen and wrote 'science papers' on them attributing to covid.</p>
<p>Then when the vaxx side effects hit, they can just say 'yup see covid is really ravaging as we told you...so take this new an improved vaxx'</p>
<p>its a very dangerou feedback loop that will be sold by the media.</p>
<p>vaccine side effects = covid death/effects = take the vaccines!!</p>
<p>"the second pandemic will really get their attention" - BG and 'that man' thing.</p></p>

        <p>I think it's more to do with people locking themselves in their basement for an entire year, eating shite, getting no sunlight or fresh air, slowly going insane with fret whilst not visiting doctors / dentists.</p>
<p>All these are immediate effects of bad hygiene, bad health choices, and increased stress levels.</p>
<p>I.e. a direct result of lockdowns.</p>

        <p>Except that the bulk of the people with those long-hauler symptoms were not doing that and many of these people got sick back in March-May and are still sick with long-hauler symptoms now.</p>
<p>Like it or not for about 1 out of a thousand people, CoVid-19 does linger in people and sicken them long term.</p>
<p>Though to point something out, other colds and flus do that to about the same percentage of people.</p>

        <p>Sounds to me like those were a CYA for radiation.  From what, who knows.  Fukushima, something shady they're doing outside at night while we're all locked down, something like that. Wouldn't surprise me if they're not zapping us all like bugs with it at this point.</p>

        <p>All this raving about weird things like teeth falling out, "long covid" ecetera is bullshit.</p>
<p>In saner times, these were referred to as "complications". They are outlier effects that occur with <em>every</em> disease, for example, pneumonia with influenza.</p>
<p>They are only being trotted out endlessly now to keep the WuFlu fear narrative going.</p>

        <p>Yes.</p>
<ol>
<li>Force as many as possible to get the vaccine.</li>
<li>A lot of side effects from vaccine are re-labeled to be COVID IS DEADLIER!</li>
<li>Because COVID IS DEADLIER now, we must force the vaccine more.</li>
<li>Go to step 2</li>
</ol>
<p>This is surely what will happen, no doubt.</p>
