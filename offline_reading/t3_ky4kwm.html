    <strong>If you want to donate to a charity that works to protect your rights, I suggest ICAN.</strong>

<p>They recently sued the Massachusetts Department of Public Health for requiring a flu vaccine for everyone attending daycare or school, ages 6 months to 29 years. Today, in response to ICAN's lawsuit, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health withdrew their flu vaccine mandate. This means that no student will be required to get the flu vaccine in order to attend school in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>This is just one of many victories by ICAN. I want them to be very well-funded for the lawsuits that will be necessary against Covid vaccine mandates.</p></p>

        <p>This is great news and comes as I mentioned this flu vaccine mandate here in MA in a post I made today too. I am not finding any articles about their lawsuit against MA Department of Public Health though, even on their website. Do you have a link you can share? I am interested in finding their lawsuit to share with others.</p>
