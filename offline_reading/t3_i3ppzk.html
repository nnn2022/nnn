    <strong>Rejecting the 'new normal' is now counterculture - nude beach observations</strong>
    <p><p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Went to local river park and a nude beach last weekend, there were huge crowds and by large no one was wearing masks nor social distancing more than what it would have been like in the old normal. Saw multitudes of topless women and had a good time.</p>
<p>We've all been steeped in the coronavirus stupid-stew of the last few months. Syncophants, doomers, sheep-people alike have all internalized the mentality of the 'new normal', and then proceed to incessantly project their own fears, insecurities and spiritual negativity to the masses, mostly for social validation. The few ultra-paranoid bunch were we lampoon on these subreddits basically think their lives are over already and live in perpetual fear of the corona, though those people you wouldn't find down at the beach or river in the old normal anyways.</p>
<p>The fact that there were large crowds of people engaging in the act of simply hanging out on a nude beach of all places, I consider active counterculture against the new normal bullshit, and it was eye-opening. This is what the pro-lockdown syncophants wage their cancel war against. Fuck that. Take precautions but enjoy life.</p></p>
