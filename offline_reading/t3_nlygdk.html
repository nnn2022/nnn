    <strong>It’s bad that people are taking the Wuhan lab leak theory for COVID seriously! It’s better to hide the truth!</strong>
    <p><p>If it is proven that COVID was a genetically-engineered virus leaked from a lab, then that fact will be used by pro-lockdown and pro-mask forces to justify all their restrictions since they can claim COVID “was a special engineered super virus”.</p>
<p>Regardless of COVID’s origins, lockdowns and excessive mask mandates were the wrong approach to deal with it, and the pro-freedom argument is easier to make if everyone assumes COVID is natural and not a super virus.</p></p>

        <p>Exactly. No proper isolation, it's all RNA strands extracted from a mixed soup of material and made into a computer model. </p>
<p>The origin speculation of something never proven to exist is irrelevant.  </p>
<p>Of course the scary sounding bioweapon crap is what they'll nudge us towards to justify their control.</p>

        <p>I think it's a good thing...the more people see the media and government are lying to them and manipulating them, the more people will wake up and be curious to see what we else we are right about.</p>

        <p>No. You pursue the truth no matter what. Doesn't depend if it's inconvenient to your narrative or worldview. If it did leak from a lab we need to know this...no matter what you say, or what news/evidence come out, the covid1984 cult is going to spin it to support thier narrative so its just best to seek the truth.</p>

        <p>I’m hoping the truth coming out will start making some people question the narrative and why “there was just so much we didn’t know” at the start of all this. If it was man-made and studied in a lab, then they should have known right away how it spreads. But no, they pushed the droplet theory on us to force the mask mandates. Then they quietly back-tracked after the public had already been conditioned to fear naked faces, and said “whoops sorry our bad, it’s actually air-born. But there’s just so much we don’t know!” Same thing with it living on surfaces, and the PCR levels for testing. If this was being studied and engineered for humans on purpose, they should have known a little bit more about it at the beginning. This is why I’m convinced it was let out on purpose as biological warfare, and not an accidental leak.</p>

        <p>I get what you're saying, but if we can bring these people to justice and have them locked in the cages they belong in, then we can make sure this never happens again.  They can't suddenly claim that it's more dangerous, it would conflict with too many other things they have said.  I think the main goal should be to bring down anybody that backed the research of the virus and lock away anybody that decided that violating people's rights was a solution to fixing THEIR fuckup.</p>
