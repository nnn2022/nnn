    <strong>I saw this on FB</strong>
    <p><p>Stolen from elsewhere:</p>
<p>ME: CDC, should I get poke if I already had Co. vid?</p>
<p>CDC: ‚ÄúYes, you should be poked regardless of whether you already had COV. ID-1 9. That‚Äôs because experts do not yet know how long you are protected from getting sick again after recovering from CO. VI D-1. 9.‚Äù</p>
<p>ME: Oh, okay, we don‚Äôt know how long natural immunity lasts. Got it. So, how long does poke-induced immunity last?</p>
<p>CDC: ‚ÄúThere is still a lot we are learning about CO. VID -1 9 pokes and CDC is constantly reviewing evidence and updating guidance. We don‚Äôt know how long protection lasts for those who are poked.‚Äù</p>
<p>ME: Okay ‚Ä¶ but wait a second. I thought you said the reason I need the poke was because we don‚Äôt know how long my natural immunity lasts, but it seems like you‚Äôre saying we ALSO don‚Äôt know how long poke immunity lasts either. So, how exactly is the poke immunity better than my natural immunity?</p>
<p>CDC: ‚Ä¶</p>
<p>ME: Uh ‚Ä¶ alright. But, haven‚Äôt there been a bunch of studies suggesting that natural immunity could last for years or decades?</p>
<p>CDC: Yes.</p>
<p>NEWYORKTIMES: ‚ÄúYears, maybe even decades, according to a new study.‚Äù</p>
<p>ME: Ah. So natural immunity might last longer than poke immunity?</p>
<p>CDC: Possibly. You never know.</p>
<p>ME: Okay. If I get the poke, does that mean I won‚Äôt get sick?</p>
<p>BRITAIN: Nope. We are just now entering a seasonal spike and about half of our infections and hospital admissions are poked people.</p>
<p>ME: CDC, is this true? Are there a lot of people in the U.S. catching Cov. id after getting the poke?</p>
<p>CDC: We stopped tracking breakthrough cases. We accept voluntary reports of breakthroughs but aren‚Äôt out there looking for them. </p>
<p>ME: Does that mean that if someone comes in the hospital with Co. vid, you don‚Äôt track them because they‚Äôve been poked? You only track the UN-poked C. ovid cases?</p>
<p>CDC: That‚Äôs right.</p>
<p>ME: Oh, okay. Hmm. Well, if I can still get sick after I get the poke, how is it helping me?</p>
<p>CDC: We never said you wouldn‚Äôt get sick. We said it would reduce your chances of serious illness or death.</p>
<p>ME: Oh, sorry. Alright, exactly how much does it reduce my chance of serious illness or death.</p>
<p>CDC: We don‚Äôt know ‚Äúexactly.‚Äù</p>
<p>ME: Oh. Then what‚Äôs your best estimate for how much risk reduction there is?</p>
<p>CDC: We don‚Äôt know, okay? Next question.</p>
<p>ME: Um, if I‚Äôm healthy and don‚Äôt want the poke, is there any reason I should get it?</p>
<p>CDC: Yes, for the collective.</p>
<p>ME: How does the collective benefit from me getting poked?</p>
<p>CDC: Because you could spread the virus to someone else who might get sick and die.</p>
<p>ME: Can a poked person spread the v  iru s to someone else?</p>
<p>CDC: Yes.</p>
<p>ME: So if I get poked, I could still spread the vir us to someone else?</p>
<p>CDC: Yes.</p>
<p>ME: But I thought you just said, the REASON I should get poked was to prevent me spreading the virus? How does that make sense if I can still catch Co. vid and spread it after getting the poke?</p>
<p>CDC: Never mind that. The other thing is, if you stay unpoked, there‚Äôs a chance the vi rus could possibly mutate into a strain that escapes the pokes protection, putting all poked people at risk.</p>
<p>ME: So the poke stops the vi rus from mutating?</p>
<p>CDC: No.</p>
<p>ME:  So it can still mutate in poked people?</p>
<p>CDC: Yes.</p>
<p>ME: This seems confusing. If the poke doesn‚Äôt stop mutations, and it doesn‚Äôt stop infections, then how does me getting poked help prevent a more deadly strain from evolving to escape the poke?</p>
<p>CDC: You aren‚Äôt listening, okay? The bottom line is: as long as you are unpoked, you pose a threat to poked people.</p>
<p>ME: But what KIND of threat??</p>
<p>CDC: The threat that they could get a serious case of Co. vid and possibly die.</p>
<p>ME: My brain hurts. Didn‚Äôt you JUST say that the poke doesn‚Äôt keep people from catching Co. vid, but prevents a serious case or dying?  Now it seems like you‚Äôre saying poked people can still easily die from C. ov id even after they got the poke just by running into an unpoked person! Which is it??</p>
<p>CDC: That‚Äôs it, we‚Äôre hanging up now.</p>
<p>ME: Wait! I just want to make sure I understand all this. So, even if I ALREADY had Co. vid, I should STILL get poked, because we don‚Äôt know how long natural immunity lasts, and we also don‚Äôt know how long poke immunity lasts. And I should get the poke to keep a poked person from catching C. ovi d from me, but even if I get the poke, I can give it to the poked person anyways. And, the other poked person can still easily catch a serious case of C ov. id from me and die. Do I have all that right?</p>
<p>‚Ä¶</p>
<p>ME: Um, hello? Is anyone there?</p></p>
