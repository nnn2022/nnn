    <strong>I don't usually agree with you guys, but commenting already got me banned from some Subs, might as well talk with you guys a bit</strong>
    <p><p>I've been subbed here for a bit. I come on, read your posts, and get a different perspective. A lot of it doesn't make sense to me, and some of it does raise some questions, and on rarer occasions I even slightly agree. It's just nice to see what the other side of the spectrum thinks about this whole situation.</p>
<p>Recently I commented on here and it got me banned from about 8 subs without warning. So I decided I may as well make a post asking you guys some questions and learning how this past year or so has effected you guys.</p>
<p>How has it effected how you interact with friends/family who don't question what all is going on? Are their any parts of the new normal you may appreciate, for example, do any of you guys who are more anti-social enjoy how much more empty stores were for a bit? Are there anytimes where you're more sad about missing how things were as opposed to angry about where things are now? </p>
<p>I've seen many perspectives on here but some direct conversation would be nice. I'll keep it as respectable as you do during conversations.</p></p>

        <p>I'll bite.</p>
<p>I'd consider myself somewhat anti social but empty grocery stores and long lines outside with people spread apart like scared robots does not being me any joy.</p>
<p>For the most part interactions with friends and family that don't question what's going on are fairly civil, although heated disagreements have definately happened, moreso recently as I am not vaccinated, nor do  I plan on it.</p>
<p>I am both sad missing things as they were and angry about how they are now.</p>
<p>I couldn't be there when my grandmother died in December 2019 with a respitory infection... (Not covid.. because our media was downplaying it at the time) and because I'm not vaxxed, my grandfather will likely never meet his granddaugter... I can't take a month off of work to do both quarantines, current restrictions make it almost impossible for the unvaxxed to fly.... It's not mandatory right?</p>
<p>Although on some level I am grateful for the 3 months I was paid to stay home, I am earning less, and financially it has been hard on our family.</p>
<p>And most importantly my child is now almost 2 years behind on support she should be getting for autism... I guess her development during a crucial time in her life is non essential.</p>
<p>TLDR: this whole fucking thing sucks and I hate it.</p>
<p>If you're not just here to troll I truly appreciate you keeping an open mind. Tell the others.</p>

        <p>I'm glad things have remained mainly Civil.  I've been on the other side of those heated disagreements and it's lost me a friend or two, not even because I wanted them out of my life. Both sides seem ready to cut ties over this and it's sad to see, I hope a lot of connections are healed when things wrap up. </p>
<p>It really was rough hearing about how people couldn't see their family members in the hospital, even though some people agree with the reason, I don't think anyones enjoyed not getting to tell their loved ones goodbye. That's one of the factors I've always agreed with when it's posted on here, it feels mad dystopian.</p>
<p>For that one part do you mean your grandson will never meet his grandfather? It does suck that you aren't able to travel. I won't debate you on it, but I see a lot of reasons for people to remain unvaccinated on here, what's your personal reason?</p>
<p>The finance point is one that really sucks. My family almost was able to escape from our rundown home to somewhere that is less of a safety hazard, but COVID hit and ruined it. There is no way to deny that the past year has messed with the economy. </p>
<p>What specific help does your daughter need? I'm on the spectrum, if it's just advice I may be able to help, but if it's specific equipment or help with speech/learning issues I've gotten nada. I wish things like that were more focused on in these times, no child's development should be put on hold.</p>
<p>I'm far from trolling, I sort of did the same thing a year or so ago with r/Christianity. I tried posting on r/atheism to talk to like minded people, and it... it isn't the most pleasant forum. So I communicated with the Christians instead. There's a lot of divide in the world, and often it's due to a lack of listening. I want to hear you guys, I want to know how to communicate with you properly, and as like as I'm respected I'd like to respect you guys. The truth is most global issues do have an objective solution that  we all likely miss because we close our minds. Even though I believe I'm in the right, there may be something you guys have to say that I've missed. That's important.</p>

        <p>My wife and I have had fertility issues in the past. And we aren't exactly sold on the benefits vs risks of taking the vaccine while trying to conceive. That's pretty much our main concern. There's also some of the weirder bill gates / depopulation stuff... Which sounds far out there but I'm also not willing to rule that out lol.</p>
<p>As for my child, they're very minimaly verbal. Definately in need of hearing and speech therapy, we are doing sessions over zoom... Hopefully they will allow in person visits soon. </p>
<p>Yeah it's hard to be civil with people you are inherently supposed to disagree with for sure.</p>
<p>I too am an atheist, but over the past few years I have stopped being so militant about it, and this covid thing has put that in perspective. Sure, religion when taken to extremes can create some truly abborant behavior, the majority of Christians just want to go to church on Sunday and be left alone.</p>

        <p>That is completely understandable and a legitimate fear. Even if someone tells you it's safe that's a big risk. If we get a year or so down the road and it seems there is no issues caused by the vaccine in that area will you consider it? This question is strictly out of curiosity, there is no right answer. </p>
<p>I can see how that'd be an issue. Do you not believe the Zoom meetings are as helpful?</p>
<p>I mean, it's easy for me until someone gets hostil. Then I stand ground. But I've had so many people get hostile. Both sides tend to pretend that it isn't their side picking fights, but both sides have rotten apples who just want to pick and prod. </p>
<p>Oh yeah. That's my main issue with r/atheism. I've never been the militant type. Have I tried to convert friends who seem to be stressing themselves out with religious guilt to the point I'm worried? Oh yeah, but I agree. Most Christians are pretty harmless now adays, a lot of them are marching towards a more progressive system, especially in my generation.</p>

        <p>I don't find the zoom meetings very helpful at all to be honest. Even the OCT on the other side admits she is as frustrated as all of her clients.. but she doesn't make the rules.</p>
<p>As for getting the vaccine in the future, I really don't know. I mean, we've gone this long without dying, and were at least a year out from reaching our goal, and alot can change in the meantime.</p>
<p>But right now I'm gonna say we probably won't be taking the shot.</p>

        <p>What do you feel is lacking? I don't doubt that there are downsides but I'd like to know them. I'm surprised speech therapy is so hard to pull off digitally, but I've also never needed it to know how it works.</p>
<p>You're very right there, a lot can change in a year. But I mean, yes, you have not died, but is possibly spreading it a concern of yours?</p>
<p>That's noted. I don't think it's a good idea but considering your circumstances I won't pretend I don't know where you're coming from.</p>

<p>You must realize they made money on flu vaccines by producing a new one every year? (yes, I meant to write <em>made</em>, but why?) They're going to do the same thing with covid, only with the government and every organization pushing it. The pharma interests are big and the money river is wide on this one. When we get a year down the road there will be another vaccine and another ostracization of folks that don't want to get it. I've never had a flu vaccine. Probably only ever had a bad flu once. Still don't want a flu vaccine. Don't want a covid vaccine. Why would anyone feel entitled to tell me I need one? If covid kills me, oh well. Just like folks telling you sometimes the vaccines kill folks. oh well. And if it's <em>to protect you</em>, welp, that's literal propaganda and I'm not qualified to teach a history lesson. If you want a vaccine, cool. My dad got one. My daughter got one. Still love them both and see them all the time.</p>

        <p>Hi. Sorry those subs banned you. It's happened to many of us here too. </p>
<p>Even though I am not getting the vaccine, it hasn't affected my interactions with family and friends in real life. Most everyone I know has been vaccinated, but they don't care if I get it. They are very respectful and treat me the same.</p>

        <p>That's an interesting turn of events. I kinda was wondering what would happen when people who came here to mock or argue with us would get banned from these other subs.</p>
<p>I mean doing this kinda proves our points about censorship and discrimination for "thought-crime".</p>
<p>My observation is that in real-life people who don't question it, rarely, if ever, talk about it. But cause and effect may be reversed here.</p>
<p>So I didn't really have any of the divide that I heard about from others. But I also keep some of my thoughts/fears to myself and express myself in ways that make it unlikely to be considered someone to avoid talking to.</p>
<p>Well, I guess I learned a lot about myself and about psychology during that time. And I must admit it's pretty interesting to follow what's going on. It's kinda like a dystopian-movie where I'm the protagonist that is faced with tough dilemmas and must find a way to survive. It feels like being tested.</p>
<p>Currently I'm neither angry nor sad. My most prominent emotion about this is probably curiosity. At least at the moment. I've also been angry and sad. But usually only about things that I heard have happened to others, not related to my own experience.</p>

        <p>I mean, I didn't come to do either. I commented on a post about why vaccinated people would worry about non-vaccinated people getting them sick. I just chimed in to say that's not really the concern but I get how it could be confusing. That got me the ban from r/aww, r/MadeMeSmile, and a good few other subs. oop.</p>
<p>I'm not a fan of censorship myself, but I will say this sub does tend to make it seem a bit more Orwell than it really is. That may just be because it doesn't effect me though, who knows.</p>
<p>That third paragraph is a bit confusingly worded. Do you mean you don't really make your more controversial fears known to people around you?</p>
<p>The protagonist perspective is an interesting way to put it. The thing I've learned from talking to both sides is that both sides really do believe they're saving the day, and the intentions really do seem to be for everyones best interest. No one seems out to end the world, even though both sides may point fingers at each other and assume so. It's sort of hard to watch people I know who have different opinions think the worst of each other instead of communicating. It feels like those family arguments where nothing is getting fixed because everyone wants to be right.</p>

        <p>Just answering the question, since I am really tired as it is nearing 3 am here:</p>
<p>Yes, exactly what I meant. With people who cannot fathom there's a conspiracy going on, I will usually only discuss "light-hearted" topics about this like how ridiculous some of the measures are and how pointless and over the top they seem to be.</p>
<p>I'll also just say stuff like: "This is suspicious" or "I don't really trust them" instead of talking about the conspiracy-theories I've heard and how afraid I am they might turn out true.</p>
<p>I mean the really scary ones, not the ones, where it's just about someone who's rich wanting to get richer.</p>
<p>The likes of "The vaccines are 95% graphene-oxide, which in the human body acts as a slow killing poison and everyone who got it is pretty much doomed."</p>
<p>I really hope the video I've seen about this are fake.</p>
<p>But the prospect that they aren't, however slim the chance, is very scary to think of.</p>
<p>A lot of things I previously deemed unimaginable have already happened. So that's where my fear is coming from.</p>

        <p>Note that I'm responding to the bottom of your response first. What things you deemed unimaginable have happened?</p>
<p>I mean, the thing about conspiracy videos is that it's easy to make anything sound true. The easiest way to do this is to build a conspiracy around facts, and then add the stretches in next to them to make it sound.</p>
<p>The best example I've seen about conspiracies and how they're built is the hoax article about Dihydrogen Monoxide. </p>
<p>In High School, around 9th grade, we were called class by class through a day to learn about Dihydrogen Monoxide. We were asked were given a list of reasons it should be banned. </p>
<p>"Is also known as hydroxyl acid, and is the major component of acid rain.</p>
<p>contributes to the "greenhouse effect"</p>
<p>May cause severe burns</p>
<p>Can be dangerous when ingested in large amounts</p>
<p>Contributes to the erosion of our natural landscape</p>
<p>Accelerates corrosion and rusting of many metals</p>
<p>May cause electrical failures and decreased effectiveness of automobile brakes</p>
<p>Has been found in excised tumors of terminal cancer patients"</p>
<p>So on and so on. Every version has different reasons. A lot of people said it should be banned. But the thing is Dihydrogen Monoxide is clearly Di(Two)Hydrogen(Hydrogen) Mon(one)oxide(oxygen). Or... H20. It's water. </p>
<p>But with all that info it sounds like a bad thing. Now let's take that a bit further. Take that entire list of negatives and start a petition on rather or not it should be banned on change .org. Now if people don't research it themselves it's easy for them to say it should be banned, too.</p>
<p>Now spread that article and show that a lot of people ant it banned. Now it looks even scarier.</p>

        <p>The worst of the things that I didn't imagine is the rampant censorship of alternative media and even things that the mainstream-media has produced in the past but seems no longer fond of.</p>
<p>Here, in Germany it started with an Interview of Wolfgang Wodarg. It was shown on TV but removed 4 days later. When I heard about it, I got curious. What did he say?</p>
<p>Well, he had given an explanation about how viruses are sesonal, how Coronaviruses always are active at this time of the year (it was March 2020), that they would go away soon even without doing anything. He outlined that it's basically the same thing that had happened before in 2009 with swine-flu and that without the test and the massive reporting, noone would even notice that anything would be different.
The documentary about 2009, which was on the french/german-cooperative TV-channel "Arte", was taken down from the official site.</p>
<p>In the time to come a lot of the people who were outspoken against the measures and had a bigger range got censored.</p>
<p>The biggest alternative media-portal in Germany, "KenFM" was simply pushed off of YouTube. Same thing recently happened to the quickly growing channel "KaiserTV".</p>
<p>One "conspiracy theory" during summer of 2020 had been. "There will be another lockdown." It was publicly denounced a conspiracy-theory and there even was an official statement of our ministry of health that went: "With the knowledge of today there wouldn't have been a lock-down."</p>
<p>And what happened? Another lockdown. When it was announced, it was meant to be for 2-3 weeks before christmas 2020. It taking longer than that was a conspiracy-theory. It lasted until May 2021, half a years instead of 2-3 weeks!</p>
<p>We now have incidence-values (active cases per 100,000) of 0 and yet there's still mask-mandated in stores. </p>
<p>The grim predictions of people like "Karl Lauterbach" were wrong again and again. Wolfgang Wodarg was right, right from the beginning. The development of infections happened exactly like he predicted. Yet he's still persona non-grata while the people who have been wrong again and again still tell us how worried they are about what might happen.</p>
<p>Also Bill Gates being interviewed and announcing on the evening-news in german television, on April 11th 2020 announced that "we will vaccinate 7 billion people":
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=083VjebhzgI</p>
<p>At a time when officially little was known about covid and there was no vaccine, they already knew that they will need a vaccine, that there will be a vaccine and that it has to be administered to 7 bn people.</p>
<p>The circumstances and contents of that interview at that time were just so bizarre. Why is there a foreign billionare, who made his money by selling overpriced software-products on our evening-news announcing the plans of "we"?</p>
<p>I can't fathom how someone can see this and just shrug it off as not suspicious at all.</p>

        <p>I believe that there is a lot going on in the background. Things we may not realise yet. Numbers have evidently been exaggerated as recent MSM articles have proven, in addition to official governmental health departments, for everyone to see. I live near an Italian city which is usually flooded with tourists. While I enjoyed spending time there, basically alone, the reason makes me sick. if you take everything they've introduced in Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945, you will see that the list is equal. That alone should shred your doubts about the things we say.</p>

        <p>I agree, but I don't think the things going on in the background are the things that anyone is suspecting.  </p>
<p>And the thing about comparing the similarities to Nazi Germany simply doesn't work for me. A lot of similarities doesn't mean anything. 15 odd similarities VS 3 or 4 very clear differences means a lot. We share 60% of DNA with bananas, but hat other 40% makes us fully functioning homosapiens.  The difference usually does lay in the differences.</p>

        <p>I never mentioned similarities. I said they're equal. The order in which control measures have been introduced is the same including explanations as to why.      </p>
<p>Back then Jews were blamed for the spread of disease and were blamed for other things, this time it's the "unvaccinated". It goes beyond my understanding how you can ignore that.      </p>
<p>Even on censoring Wiki you can read up about it. Look up "yellow star" in German as that section is way more extensive than in the English language and run it through a translation software like DeepL.     </p>
<p>Think what you will of what I said but at least read up on that section. Maybe it'll be an eye opener.</p>

        <p>I get where you're going with this, but the Allegory of the Cave could be applied to either side. </p>
<p>One of my favorite writing prompts I've ever done is to write a story based on that Allegory. I think when you have to think of creative ways to portray that idea you stumble upon some ideas that may bring you out of your comfort zone. It's a good mental exercise and an even better writing exercise.</p>

        <p>Since you've been here for awhile I think you can agree that the vast majority of the time people here are reasonable and rational. The sub doesn't attack people or ban people unless it pretty obvious they are trolls or shills. Even then they manage to stay on the sub for some time.</p>
<p>I was COVID-19 vaccine hesitant before. Now I am a full blown anti-COVID-19-vaxxer. The extreme push makes me wonder WTF is going on.</p>
<p>Anyway to your questions. </p>
<p>Most people I know are either okay with taking the vaccine or are willing to take it for travel purposes. My wife took it and asked me to stop stalking about it. I'm not too sure about the shedding aspect, but that's beyond my control now anyway. I had a mental break a few weeks back where I couldn't wear a mask anymore. Now when I go into stores I get told to wear a mask and I truthfully reply that I cant (I did for 16 months). As someone who has had almost all vaccines, I will probably get them after a few years. But not now.</p>
<p>I am now preparing for being ostracized from society. I do feel sadness and some bewilderment about how people can accept all of this. The stores here aren't as empty. Its just more stressful being treated like a leper.</p>

        <p>Rational may not always fit this sub but that is not an insult. I don't think rational fits most subs that are more community based, but I even feel that way about subs that are filled with people I classify with like r/atheism.</p>
<p>The reasonable part, however, I see. Are they reasons I agree with? No. But I do see that you guys have reasons that stem from sources way more fair than you guys are credited for. There are a lot of tin-foil hat conspiracies on here, and there is a lot of bias-confirmation, but there is a lot of bias-confirmation on the other side too. The least logical thing I've heard on here as a reason to trust something is the "I trust it because it was hidden, why would it be hidden if it wasn't the truth?" It sounds logical at first, and it may even hold some water, but there are so many areas of life where that isn't the case.</p>
<p>The thing about your statement for why you're anti-COVID-19-vaxx makes sense, but let me give you a separate perspective. In the event COVID-19 really is the beast the other side thinks it is don't you think it would make sense for them to be insistent.</p>
<p>Think about it like a fire. If you called a fire truck to put it out, one firefighter started trying to put it out, and the rest said "Well, he's putting it out so no need for me to" wouldn't you be rather insistent they help?</p>
<p>But I completely understand the mask thing, I really do. It seems you really did try at first, and I'm doubtful you're being careless without one. Mental breakdowns are no joke, regardless the reason.</p>

        <p>Thanks, I wish I could wear a mask. I'm down to one store I go to now. Its a lose/lose situation for me.</p>
<p>I understand what you mean about the fire. Many people think COVID-19 is akin to the Bubonic Plague or  worse. I can't support it here and now but there are many examples of case and death inflation numbers. Governments, when pressed admit that dying 3 months after a positive COVID-19 test results in a COVID-19 death, so suicides and car accidents are included. Many people think COVID-19 is a death sentence so they are worried. So I do get that. I can almost smell the fear at times. It strikes at the lizard brain.</p>
<p>Key: "A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky dangerous animals and you know it. Fifteen hundred years ago everybody knew the Earth was the center of the universe. Five hundred years ago, everybody knew the Earth was flat, and fifteen minutes ago, you knew that humans were alone on this planet."
Men In Black</p>
<p>In short my thoughts:
COVID-19 is real.
It is deadly.
It is not as deadly as it is made out to be.
It became political.
Measures taken have hurt us more in the long term.</p>

        <p>A lot of the reasons people validate research on here isn't too based in hard fact. I'm not saying most of the people who are uber-strict about the COVID restrictions are great at that either, but honestly it's rare I fully agree with them, too. </p>
<p>Both sides have different ways of confirming things without really confirming them. I've heard the "it's hidden so it must be the truth" and the "these are things that were said and they're possible, so obviously it's happening!" type of conclusion forming. It just doesn't set right with me, from either side.</p>
<p>The truth is most people have a boat-load of opinions about COVID that aren't informed, and both sides ignore the other side when they have valid opinions.</p>

        <p>I do prefer people not breathing down my neck when I'm queueing up for stuff I won't lie. To me it doesn't make any sense but I won't argue for it going back to how it was. </p>
<p>As for family it put a few things into perspective to say the least. I think I helped wake my brother up this last year quite a bit. My Dad on the other hand was not possible, I rememeber over hearing him telling my brother not to listen to what I'm saying because it's not true and my brother standing up for me and saying that even though he might not like what I say if he researched what I was saying he'd find out there is truth to it. So is good to know my bro has my back.</p>

        <p>Saying big pharma companies are starving for more money and using all means to it, or that there was an attempt to cover the possible China resposibility on the outbreak or even that some corrupt politicians are actually benefiting from all this catastrophe, are  still considered conspiracy theories by a lot of people.</p>

I don’t really blame anyone who lives still lives in la la land. Reality is scary, not everyone can handle it. Sometimes when I talk to people It feels like I’m in another dimension, the upside down, the matrix, down the rabbit hole into wonderland.

        <p>It's semi-true. McDonald's isn't giving out a McVaxx or anything like that themselves, but they have partnered with California's Department of Public Health to make some restaurant locations into covid vaccination centers, while offering complimentary food to people going there to get their shots.</p>

        <p>I have lost a few friends (maybe we are still amicable but the functioning relationship is gone). I may be about to lose my job over my convictions (they require proof of double shots by Sept 1st), and I really like my new job. So be it, I can always find another. Or move to an area that has banned forced vaxx as a condition of employment. </p>
<p>The biggest change has been seeing how even my smartest friends throw all logic out the window and will resort to emotional arguments out of fear. </p>
<p>And that a lot of my so called anti establishment friends justify censorship of differing opinions. </p>
<p>No matter what your vaxx status I appreciate that you are open minded, willing to hear a different view point, and has a tingling “where there’s smoke there’s fire” sense. If everything was perfectly safe, why would they censor differing information?</p>

        <p>I was also banned from a few subs.  </p>
<p>I wear that as a badge now.  I'm very happy to see all the well written thoughts in this thread and thanks for your post.  </p>
<p>My biggest concerns revolve around the censorship - we're seeing situations where non-doctors are blocking doctors and claiming fact-checking.</p>
<p>I understand hesitancy because of it's emergency use only authorization.  It appears to be an unpaid gene therapy trial.</p>
<p>As in everything, there's always a lot of money moving around.  I understand why hospitals and media and government all agree and move in Lock-Step. Why do the other doctors, nurses, paramedics, etc. speak out about it?  It would seem to be career suicide.  I can't figure why they would . . . Maybe if they're selling a book, or a snake oil cure.  We would trust these people with our lives and they are being muted.  We don't even know how many there are (with this stance) because they're routinely removed from the platforms and their voices stifled.  What's the benefit to them?  The only thing I can come up with it actual concern, morally or medically.  </p>
<p>What's bad about this new normal?  A lot.  Let's start with the mask as a symbol.  From the beginning I've worn it diligently.  All the while feeling it is ineffective and unnecessary.  That's at least a year and a half purely out of spite.  I want it burned in my head who's buying it and who's selling it.  At the same time, I want to maintain a civil society.  There is a lot of cognitive dissonance in this nuanced position.  I wear it, I loath it, I demand others also wear it in places where the policy dictates it, and inside I celebrate when people challenge it.  I'll gladly throw up my hands, I'm not my brothers keeper.    </p>
<p>What's good about it?
It divides the masses.  We see each other, our friends, coworkers ,family for who we are and what we stand for.</p>
<p>I've found some unlikely allies in these challenging times and they seem like rational thinking people - they challenge me, I challenge them, we don't always agree.  That's OK.</p>
<p>We all need more people to think and speak freely.  </p>
<p>No more bans - It says more about those subs than this one.</p>

        <p>Don’t worry about opinions,  just look at the facts and decide for yourself:</p>
<p>COVID Survival rates by age group:</p>
<p>0-19 Years 99.997%</p>
<p>20-49 Years 99.98%</p>
<p>50-69 years 99.5%</p>

<p>Also, These numbers include people with underlying health conditions. So if you are otherwise healthy. your numbers are even higher.</p>
<p>as a 34 year old otherwise healthy male, my survival rate is about 99.995% IF I get it.</p>
<p>That's about the chance i die choking on my fruit loops tomorrow morning while eating breakfast...</p>
<p>Am I going to take some experimental mRNA vaccine because for this?  Probably not.</p>

        <p>I mean, no. I don't really agree there. Speech has consequences all the time, how someone reacts to your words is up to them. </p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying they're in the right, but just like they've banned me for commenting here, I've also been blocked by friends I disagreed with over things I've said. It sucks, but just like we're free to say something, they're free to react.</p>
