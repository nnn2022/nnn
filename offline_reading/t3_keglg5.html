    <strong>How the covid death rate is faked to scare people.</strong>
    <p><p>Determining the percent of the population who had covid is most accurate using T-cell research.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3563">https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3563</a></p>
<p>&rt;Buggert’s study in Sweden seems to support this position. Investigating close family members of patients with confirmed covid-19, he found T cell responses in those who were seronegative or asymptomatic.<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3563#ref-10"><strong>10</strong></a> While around 60% of family members produced antibodies, 90% had T cell responses. (Other studies have reported similar results.<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3563#ref-27"><strong>27</strong></a>) “So many people got infected and didn’t create antibodies,” concludes Buggert.</p>
<p>In every study to date, the T-cell responses have been higher than antibody responses.</p>
<p>This is because T-cells are the first line of defence and often sufficient against covid without antibodies. </p>
<p>https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/09/uncoordinated-immune-response-may-explain-why-covid-19-strikes-some-hard-particularly  </p>
<p>“It looks like T cells play a more important role than antibodies during natural infection,” says Crotty, immunologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology</p>
<p>“Our data indicate that these T cell responses are probably really important—and probably even more important the older you are.”</p>
<p>https://news.ki.se/immunity-to-covid-19-is-probably-higher-than-tests-have-shown</p>
<p>"Our results indicate that roughly twice as many people have developed T-cell immunity compared with those who we can detect antibodies in.”</p>
<p>"Patients with severe COVID-19 often developed a strong T-cell response and an antibody response; in those with milder symptoms it was not always possible to detect an antibody response, but despite this many still showed a marked T-cell response.”</p>
<p>It's important to understand that a huge number of people have had covid. As of the beginning of October:</p>
<p>- The WHO estimates that 750m people have been infected by covid based on antibody test results. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/covid-19-world-in-for-a-hell-of-a-ride-in-coming-months-dr-mike-ryan-says-1.4370626">https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/covid-19-world-in-for-a-hell-of-a-ride-in-coming-months-dr-mike-ryan-says-1.4370626</a></p>
<p>In other words, this is the low number of infections, without counting T-cell only responses or those who have lost their antibodies.</p>
<p>Next, how are covid deaths determined?</p>
<p>https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/public-health-england-death-data-revised/</p>
<p>\&rt;Died within 28 days of a positive COVID-19 test </p>
<p>When you understand that the numbers we are using are completely skewed, it helps understand the true dangers involved. No one would accept a "vaccine death" as anyone who died within 28 days of taking a vaccine and no one would accept the "vaccine death rate" to be determined based on less than 4% of the total vaccinations. But that is what they do with covid.</p>
<p>They use "reported numbers" , which they know does not reflect anywhere near the total cases (when the WHO estimated 750m cases worldwide, the reported cases were only 4.6% of that) and then lump any death that happens within 28 days as a covid death.</p>
<p>Doing the same for vaccines yields a 2% death rate (assuming everyone got vaccinated on Day 1 and then Day 21).</p>
<p>Average deaths per day 150,000 (as of 2017)</p>
<p>Days for determining a "vaccine death" (following the standard used for determine a "covid death") = 21 + 28 = 49 days</p>
<p>Total vaccine deaths = 49 X 150,000 = 7.35m</p>
<p>Worlds population 7.8b x 4.6% (reported cases) = 358.8m reported vaccinations</p>
<p>7.35m death / 358.8 reported vaccinations = 2% death rate for covid vaccination</p></p>

        <p>From a nurse in LA who posted on social media: ICU nurse in LA metro here. The environment at work is unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. We all know hell is coming. Beds are one thing — what will you do when the ventilators are all used up and the medicines run out and the RTs and RNs and MDs are stretched to the breaking point? Most of us aren’t afraid. It’s not about fear. It’s about being forced to live out a reality we should have never been required to experience.</p>
<p>Death isn’t new to us — it’s a part of life we are very conscious of. The sheer numbers lately are the problem. You hear two or three code blues every shift. You get told you have to keep your deceased patient in the bed a little longer while they figure out how to make space in the morgue. You come back after two days off and half of the floor is “discharged”. You call blood bank to get some convalescent plasma and they tell you they are completely out and that they don’t know when they will have it again.</p>
<p>I won’t ever be able to use FaceTime again after this is all over. I’ve had to hear too many families say goodbye from afar. I’ve had to hide my tears as I prepare wives and husbands to lose their spouses they’ve been married to for 40,50 years. I’ve heard people’s school-aged children begging for them to live, screaming with grief at the realization they will never see their parent again. In the end it isn’t the death itself that scars you. It’s the consequences that will echo through our society for a long time.</p>

        <p>Lots of nurses saying the opposite.</p>
<p>As for, "stretched to the breaking point", happens every flu season.</p>
<p>But, I guess you knew that.</p>
