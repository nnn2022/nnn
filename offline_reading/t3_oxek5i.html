        <p>Not quite, but the vaccine passports on the phone are pretty damn close to the mark. Especially if they further push them for basic activities.</p>

        <p>Well for starters, I think the actual mark of the beast will be something readily visible. Right now I can easily lie and say I‚Äôve had the vaccine, and even if they start requiring proof, it‚Äôs still not quite the same.
I think there‚Äôs also still too much of a push-back against the vaccine. The Bible says that most will be deceived, so I think it‚Äôs going to be incredibly persuasive and sneaky. However this has all really opened my eyes to how the world will eventually get to that point. Pretty surreal at times to take it all in and truly see the Bible playing out right in front of our eyes.</p>

        <p>You‚Äôll still be able to buy online and have it delivered...for now.  The mark will grant actual immunity to the make-believe virus.  This is NOT it.  But it‚Äôs the beginning.  Also the Lord says in the book of revelation that everyone on earth will be warned in a very clear way that the mark is here, and what will happen if they take it.  That hasn‚Äôt happened yet, I am absolutely sure.</p>

        <p>JD Farag does a good job of explaining this. From what my little brain understood is that if you've heard that some people become magnetic, it's because some of the vaccines contain something called graphene which only becomes magnetic when it reaches room temperature which is why certain vaccines had to be frozen and there was all that protocol. The way the metal and God knows what else effects the body, we're kind of slowly becoming one with technology where we'll have a digital chip and perhaps these boosters will become upgrades. They're foreseeing a lot of people with alzheimers because it affects the brain so much.  So those who don't ask to be saved and get the vaccine will be something not quite human that can't be saved. I'm not sure how the vaccine affects the soul. Maybe an altered mind strays away from religion and can be manipulated to place more value in earthly things, hence idolizing something other than God which leads to people not being saved.</p>

        <p>I do follow Farag, but I haven‚Äôt seen him explaining this, will look at it. I suppose graphene could be magnetic, but not in the same way that iron is. Iron is ferromagnetic, like, it can turn into a magnet it you align the electrons. Graphene is diamagnetic, and I think it is still diamagnetic when cold or room temp. Diamagnetism basically means not magnetic at all. </p>
<p>Actually, I just looked it up and graphene has its own special kind of magnetism. So, I stand corrected and vaccines may be plugging us into the internet. Might get back to you after I‚Äôve heard what Farag has to say.</p>

        <p>My take on it is that the NWO's symbolism and Easter Eggs are all part of the mind games.</p>
<p>Ultimately, they know that religious people have a respect for tradition while they themselves wish only to mock and usurp it. The fundamental motive of the "satanic" principle is to question god and destroy the natural order of things.</p>
<p>This is true for the practices of what technocrats, eugenicists and all the other pals of the world conspiracy believe in. A more enlightened illuminatus would surely see that logic is not the answer to everything and that the better way to use technology is to aid humanity rather than enslave it.</p>
<p>However, they have chosen a path that is all too human. They are corrupted by power and they will try to aggrandize that situation. They believe their own lies, same hybris as any other oligarchy before its downfall. </p>
<p>I wish to point out that the word demon was not even negative for centuries that the ancient world believed in its old ways. The demons or spirits were often attributed with good cosmic principles. In the end, it was a very multi faceted downturn and collapse of society that made people hate their old demons and push the new Christian cult.</p>
<p>They did not stop believing, however. They crushed all the old temples and buried the depictions of their previous faith because they still believed in their power.</p>
<p>Transhumanism is similar. It wishes to become the new religion so it works with the previous one that has informed its own identity.</p>
<p>Humans are simple creatures, really. I love them.</p>

        <p>The mark refers to deliberate alignment with the unbelieving world system, rather than a single act or thing which may happen to a person accidentally. The problem with this topic is that it is often discussed apart from its biblical context. Revelation was intended to benefit the persecuted church in every generation, not just one generation 2000 years after it was written. Therefore it must have application to the church throughout history, rather than referring to an obscure future technology. Perhaps this link might be helpful if you want to investigate in more detail. </p>

        <p>Now this I disagree with. I respectfully disagree. I am what you would probably call a ‚Äúfuturist.‚Äù And yes I am, and I have looked at this topic for years and have come to the conclusions that I have today. Revelation was meant for use in every generation. The seven churches mentioned in 2 and 3, though they were literal churches, I believe also represent the different time periods of the church. I think we are in Laodecia, the ‚Äúlukewarm‚Äù church. And‚Ä¶ I could continue, but I think that we will probably not change either of our views and may devolve into uncivil discussion.</p>

        <p>These discussions often do turn uncivil unfortunately. As you can tell, I don't accept the dispensational viewpoint. I was just answering the question from my own perspective. I think it may be helpful for those who are not believers to understand that Christians have differing opinions on this topic.</p>

        <p>Seeing that Christ‚Äôs body was the Temple, its possible that when he is born into the world the third temple is built. It‚Äôs possible he‚Äôs already born into the world. But idk how well that aligns with different standard dogmas. Clearly revelation doesn‚Äôt say he will be born at all but that book is clear allegorical references</p>

        <p>Very interesting. But Jesus didn't require Christians to take a mark to buy or sell. And to my knowledge it would be a 3.5 year mark into his "ministry" that the abomination would occur.
Revalations isn't the only book to educate on this topic. It's prophesied in the old testament as well</p>

<p>Lately, though I been more interested in Enoch and other stuff that didn't make it in. </p>
<p>I do have a questions about old testament justice.  I can't understand Job. Or half of Genesis.  How do you reconcile that notion of monotheism with sensible concepts of fairness or goodness.</p>
<p>Job is a good story if you are Job maybe, but I hope you aren't one of his kids...</p>

        <p>So it's likely that the Dome of the Rock is something that was referenced in the OT, as the "Abomination of Desolation". And once Israel just gets sick of the Palestinian situation, they'll essentially take the Temple Mount, rebuild the Temple and ATTEMPT to restart the daily sacrifices to God. You have seven years after these events take place.</p>

        <p>Pre trib rapture has zero scriptural support. It is never mentioned in the Bible and purely speculated based on churches not being mentioned for a while in Revelations.</p>
<p>It's a doctrine for lukewarm Christians to go along with the world's evil agendas (that we are already seeing) with zero inconvenience and actual choice towards God, and still feel superior. Fatalistic and lazy, completely contrary to what Jesus taught in his entire ministry. </p>
<p>I would love to hear your reasons for actually believing in it other than some controlled opposition pastors plugging it.</p>
<p>As for point 4, prophecy never specifically teaches that the antichrist will declare himself as God inside the third temple. What it says is this</p>
<p>Mark 13
14¬†But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:</p>
<p>Or </p>
<p>Matthew 24
15¬†When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:)</p>
<p>That's it. No mention of declaring himself as God, merely an abomination in a holy or inappropriate place.</p>
<p>Also the perfect red heifer may have already come</p>

        <p>I fully believe that this situation is the strong delusion spoken of in 2 Thessalonians 2.  This is not the mark of the beast, but the mark will be for proof of something that‚Äôs gonna finally bring immunity, since they are building the story of an unreliable vaccine. They have to keep the vaccinated scared of the unvaccinated.  That‚Äôs why the vax is sub-par.  It‚Äôs a well thought out plot.  </p>
<p>I do think there are deadly consequences to taking the vax, though.</p>

<p>https://news.mit.edu/2019/storing-vaccine-history-skin-1218</p>
<p>The false religion is scientism, worship of fake science. It is pure dogma, not based in logic. </p>
<p>There is no place in scripture that it says the mark has to "be obvious". Read your Bibles people. All it says is that the mark is associated with the number of the beast. And that one will have to take the mark OR the number OR the name of the beast. </p>
<p>Yes a man of perdition will rise and he will be strongly idolised. But the "once saved always save" doctrine is false, as is pre trib rapture. Nowhere is pre-trib rapture even mentioned, it is all speculated based on churches no being mentioned for a while in revelations. </p>
<p>Both are easily disproved if one actually reads their Bibles. </p>
<p>As Christians we are called to exercise our God given judgement in these last days, and prove that we love him more than the world. Don't expect to comfortably follow along with every evil agenda of the world and just be "poofed" away regardless of your actions. This goes completely contrary to Jesus' teachings where he asks his followers to exercise discernment.</p>

        <p>Even though the vaccine is highly problematic it is not the mark. What raises my eyebrows is how this situation is being used as a springboard by unelected global leaders to rapidly and forcefully change every aspect of society to fit their vision of how the world should be. I would imagine that economic participation will not only be contingent on vaccinated status, but expanded to resemble China's social credit system. Then soon after contingent on allegiance to a certain world leader who will emerge out of nowhere, if you know who I mean ... But pre-trib here too, so not too concerned about that last bit.</p>

        <p>Since you asked. The MOB is more of a system of things not just a single thing, similar to how there are many Antichrists - the Antichrist spirit that roams the earth. This vaccine is part of that system along with things like corrupt government system we are currently dealing with, the banking system etc that is all a part of that system (which is all described in the vision of the beast given to Daniel). </p>
<p>The number 666 works out perfectly in the Roman Numeral value  to the Latin word Vicarious Fili Dei (substitute a V for U as is customary with Latin and skip the letters that do not have a Roman Numeral Value) - Latin Vicar of God which is the Latin Title for the Pope and The head of the beast system.  </p>
<p>When God have the commandments to Israel God told them </p>
<p>‚ÄúYou shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise. You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.‚Äù
‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Deuteronomy‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠6:7-8‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠ESV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨</p>
<p>It was God‚Äôs commandments that was His mark on His people. That was what leaves his mark to distinguish them on their forehead and their hand. </p>
<p>In revelations we see that ‚ÄúThen I saw another beast rising out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb and it spoke like a dragon. It exercises all the authority of the first beast in its presence, and makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose mortal wound was healed. It performs great signs, even making fire come down from heaven to earth in front of people, and by the signs that it is allowed to work in the presence of the beast it deceives those who dwell on earth, telling them to make an image for the beast that was wounded by the sword and yet lived. And it was allowed to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast might even speak and might cause those who would not worship the image of the beast to be slain. Also it causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, to be marked on the right hand or the forehead, so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of its name. This calls for wisdom: let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666.‚Äù
‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Revelation‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠13:11-18‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠ESV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨</p>
<p>The second beast comes from the earth (not the sea like the first one - sea symbolizes people so the second beast will come from a less populated area ) The purpose of the second beast beast is to cause people to worship the first beast. Second beast will be publicly visible while the first beast may be hidden. It will animate the image and it will responsible for the mark of the beast. </p>
<p>If you choose to take the mark of the beast you don‚Äôt become unsaved.  This is what awaits: </p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a loud voice, ‚ÄúIf anyone worships the beast and its image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, he also will drink the wine of God‚Äôs wrath, poured full strength into the cup of his anger, and he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever, and they have no rest, day or night, these worshipers of the beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name.‚Äù‚Äù
‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Revelation‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠14:9-11‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠ESV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not just that you would receive some mark it‚Äôs that you would be rejecting God and worshipping another god. </p>
<p>I also HIGHLY suggest an in-depth study into the possibility of there not being a rapture. Look at the verses used to support rapture and use a concordance to look into the Greek and Hebrew. </p>
<p>Be well.</p>

        <p>I was going to formulate my thoughts to write a carefully detailed response. But, it‚Äôs like 11:00 pm right now so maybe I‚Äôll get back to you in the morning. </p>
<p>I would like to say ask this though. Do you believe that we are experiencing the tribulation currently, or is that still to come?</p>

        <p>I don‚Äôt think we are there YET but we are getting there. These verses are one reason why:</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄúSo when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place ( let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let the one who is on the housetop not go down to take what is in his house, and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak. And alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days! Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath. For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be. And if those days had not been cut short, no human being would be saved. But for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short. Then if anyone says to you, ‚ÄòLook, here is the Christ!‚Äô or ‚ÄòThere he is!‚Äô do not believe it. For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. See, I have told you beforehand. So, if they say to you, ‚ÄòLook, he is in the wilderness,‚Äô do not go out. If they say, ‚ÄòLook, he is in the inner rooms,‚Äô do not believe it. For as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.‚Äù
‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Matthew‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠24:15-27‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠ESV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨</p>
<p>We are not to the point YET that the atrocities going on are greater than they ever have been in history. They are very close to that point though. We also don‚Äôt have anyone claiming YET that they Messiah is appearing in all these places but the stage is set for this with various things - project blue beam, the weird ‚Äòceremony‚Äô at the G7 summit on the beach this year that some thing is the beast that comes from the water etc - </p>
<p>I don‚Äôt honestly know if this is a period of history with tribulation or the big tribulation. As believers we aren‚Äôt promised an easy road for our faith, despite enjoying that in many places like here in the United States. That is changing. Time will tell what kind of tribulation this will become for believers specifically. I have seen some seen some sparse videos/articles linking vaccine hesitancy and outbreaks to what the media is labeling ‚Äúreligious extremism ‚Äú (anyone who is of christian faith and will not take the vaccine) so we will see if that narrative takes off. </p>
<p>I think the important to remember the enemy- satan - is going to scheme for the rest of his time. It‚Äôs what He does. We don‚Äôt want to spend to much time trying to figure out his plan because it‚Äôs honestly irrelevant IF you believe in Jesus. The time here will be a a tiny blip in existence of eternity. </p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? When evildoers assail me to eat up my flesh, my adversaries and foes, it is they who stumble and fall. Though an army encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; though war arise against me, yet I will be confident. One thing have I asked of the Lord, that will I seek after: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to gaze upon the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temple. For he will hide me in his shelter in the day of trouble; he will conceal me under the cover of his tent; he will lift me high upon a rock. And now my head shall be lifted up above my enemies all around me, and I will offer in his tent sacrifices with shouts of joy; I will sing and make melody to the Lord. Hear, O Lord, when I cry aloud; be gracious to me and answer me! You have said, ‚ÄúSeek my face.‚Äù My heart says to you, ‚ÄúYour face, Lord, do I seek.‚Äù Hide not your face from me. Turn not your servant away in anger, O you who have been my help. Cast me not off; forsake me not, O God of my salvation! For my father and my mother have forsaken me, but the Lord will take me in. Teach me your way, O Lord, and lead me on a level path because of my enemies. Give me not up to the will of my adversaries; for false witnesses have risen against me, and they breathe out violence. I believe that I shall look upon the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living! Wait for the Lord; be strong, and let your heart take courage; wait for the Lord!‚Äù

<p>Amen to that as that is the blessed hope. However, I wouldn‚Äôt say that I‚Äôm trying to figure out the Devil‚Äôs plans, rather I‚Äôm trying to see how current event‚Äôs line up with the Word. </p>
<p>Other than this comment probably reflects my viewpoint the most.</p>
<p>Edit: I realize calling what I did as the blessed hope may be a bit vague. Though I think you‚Äôll understand I‚Äôll clarify by saying that the blessed hope is that we are sealed in salvation by God through Jesus and that we know he will return soon, so we don‚Äôt have to worry (note that I mean worry as in distress, it is certainly good to keep in the Word and see the signs of the times) ourselves over these matters.</p>

        <p>I couldn't give an honest answer. The only role Religion has ever had on me is my moral foundation which is built upon Judeo-Christian values and principles. However I do not nor have I ever practiced any faith. Not all religious people will think covid is the MOTB. This is technically an anecdote, but my Aunt from Minnesota is deeply religious a very devout catholic she is also a hypocrite because she is an alcoholic who would get drunk and belittle my Mother her younger sister about her supporting Trump. My mother cut ties because she was being toxic and my mother never once talked to my aunt about politics the only thing is she knew who we voted for. I'm getting off topic, but she eats up the msm lies and bullcrap. She believes Trump is the evil bad orange man and all that nonsense. So I imagine if she read this she would go on a tangent.</p>

        <p>I understand if you don‚Äôt believe in any of this stuff. It is very theological and it probably looks like gibberish and like an actual conspiracy theory to non-Christians. But I think you‚Äôd be surprised how many people on this sub believe at least some form of what I‚Äôm saying. It certainly isn‚Äôt leftist conspiracy theories, though I know that it isn‚Äôt the greatest thing to use in an argument. </p>
<p>Look at how much talk on this sub is about the NWO or the Great Reset. A lot of those things also look like conspiracy theories. My viewpoint is one from Christianity, and I think that what is going on today lines up with stuff talked about in Revelation more than any other time before. Just because I‚Äôm talking about something that you don‚Äôt agree with, that doesn‚Äôt make it garbage.</p>

        <p>One of the first things I did in March 2020 is reread Revelations.  There are some similarities, but it was  like he was describing the spirit of this Era more than anything.</p>
<p>I would entertain this discussion, but I can see how it could be divisive. The only thing is, that I must say, the notion of this connection has certainly galvanized me.  I see this as more of a "spiritual" conflict. As such, I'm less likely to be moved from my position. I'm not even religious, but those narratives will always make me take this seriously.</p>
