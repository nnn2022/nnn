    <strong>You are what you eat? Rather you are what you watch</strong>
    <p><p>They say “you are what you eat,” perhaps, but “you are what you watch” rings somewhat more pertinent and even true. The media is being effectively utilized to mould the perspective of individuals that make up society, and despotic leaders around the world have long been aware of this potential and have kept a tight grip on the media since time immemorial. Though in Canada the same dynamics are at play, they just seem a little more subtle or it may simply seem that way because we are being spoon-fed this one narrative and we have no relative comparison, and perhaps the average citizen in the DPRK or PRC would likewise fail to recognize the tendentious narrative that is being thrust down by the state via television, radio, and newspapers. It seems now that the social media giants have actually teamed up with governments to “stop the spread of misinformation,” because of course they are nothing but a fountainhead of veracity. </p>
<p>Did you know that if you were to compare the charts of covid cases and deaths from different jurisdictions that have or have not imposed mask mandates and/or lockdowns, you actually wouldn’t be able to tell them apart? </p>
<p>Did you know that the Ebola virus actually had a much higher death rate than covid yet required neither vaccines or worldwide lockdowns for it to disappear? It’s simply been recycled through the news media and it no longer concerns us. </p>
<p>Did you know that the accuracy of the covid tests is actually open to question? Consider for example that the cases of influenza, which is really transmitted in the same way as covid, seems to have plummeted while the cases of covid have skyrocketed? Could the former have been lumped into the latter? Is government really an honest reporter of statistics to begin with? Are they not rather notorious in being inconsistent on exactly this account, especially when it concerns their own image and interest, consider how government statisticians for example ceased on counting the so-called “discouraged workers” as part of unemployment figures, because perhaps it would thereby bring up more favorable figures. Also consider for example how the term “inflation” has been altered in its definition from initially meaning an increase in the supply of money to an increase in the price level, thereby shifting blame from those who issue money (i.e. the central bank) to those who offer their goods and services in exchange for money. Peter Schiff says that having the government in charge of measuring inflation is like getting the mafia tasked on measuring the crime rate. </p>
<p>They tell us that the vaccines will not be made mandatory, but if you need to have taken the vaccine in order to go to the store, restaurants, or your workplace, can you really say that it isn’t mandatory?</p>
<p>Lockdowns are impoverishing the people, not just financially, but socially, just so that our octogenarians can be safe. Wouldn’t a more group-specific targeted effort been more effective one wonders, have these drastic measures that have impacted society with such damage and destruction in a dozen other ways really worth the cost?</p>
<p>Though the likes of Dr Fauci seems to have been handed the bullhorn, but there are many other experts in this field that have legitimate and professional disagreements with the drastic measures being proposed by the state and its carefully selected medical technocrats, but there has been created an environment now where their opinions are not welcome as it would challenge the mainstream and all the religious-like zeal of the sheeple that’s tied into it. </p>
<p>Folks, I’m linking here a great speech given by Dr Thomas Woods and a podcast episode featuring Brett Hawes, they will point out the absurdity of all this much better than I can, but for once take the initiative yourself to research further than CBC and other mainstream sources, because only in comparison can you come to realize how tendentious what they are spewing really is. I’ve also got two other links that will compare charts of different jurisdictions in terms of covid cases and deaths.</p>
