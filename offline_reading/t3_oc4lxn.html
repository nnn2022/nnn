        <p>The problem is rooted. You can find posts of people whit various psychological disorders (mainly anxiety disorders) that are actually worried about mask lifting.
They feel more safe, hidden,and don't want to take it away anymore.
Same for lockdowns.
Even some non-anxious people have developed a sort of shame in taking it off,as a sort of novel prudery,even that can go away quite easily with time.
Anyway,as long as they let us choose, they can keep it forever.</p>

        <p>As I walked down a sidewalk, going about my day and enjoying the fresh air and the life-giving Vitamin-D inducing sunlight;</p>
<p>(on separate occasions, and by Cult of The Maskers)</p>
<ol>
<li>One lady dodges into the entrance of a parking lot to avoid me, and stands there as I move past - and almost gets run over and honked at by a vehicle trying to leave</li>
<li>Man with dog jumps into the road off the sidewalk and almost gets hit by a cyclist</li>
<li>Lady goes into a ditch and almost sprains her ankle trying to avoid me, which makes me say "FFS! I'm not that dangerous" (I was concerned she almost hurt herself)</li>
<li>Lady does similar, but dodges into an area with fallen tree sticks and debris and pretty much scratches up her legs - looks painful and again I am forced to react by saying "Well FFS don't hurt yourself! you okay?" where she responds by murmuring something through her Mask about I dunno...</li>
<li>My favourite was now that school was out, the teenage girl with her face buried in the phone until she almost ran into me and she almost had a heart attack being faced with a maskless man hahah</li>
</ol>
<p>At some point.. It's not funny anymore, and these people no longer anger me.. I'm just like 'FFS... " now..</p>
<p>In trying to avoid me, they're putting themselves in ACTUAL danger by trying to avoid me with a 8 foot or more swath...</p>
<p>Imagine spraining your ankle, scratching and stabbing yourself with sticks and who knows what in the ditch, or getting run over by a vehicle or hit by a bicycle trying to avoid a PERFECTLY HEALTHY PERSON on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>If it's not that, then it's some feminist woman who is in my lane coming at me and won't move to the right, trying even then to assert her dominance - of course she loses too though. I have right of way, and that's it.</p>
<p>I give people ample space to pass, and even accommodate them as well, but 14 months later.. Nah.. I'm not altering my trajectory for you anymore. I'll give you room and that's it.</p>

        <p>Well yea, you can set up outdoor uncovered tables on the sidewalks in NYC and I can walk past you eating without a mask on with no worries, that whole concept made no sense at all. We are in an experiment but not a medical but a conditioning of our society. Seems like they are gadging on what the percentage of the population is compliant when the real operation starts.

        <p>The Mask is a symbol that's why. As long as The Mask remains and is seen while out in public, it drives this whole pandemic and narrative, and keeps the fear alive.</p>
<p>I'm not as much against you wearing The Mask (as part of your choice) but more against it as a symbol.</p>
<p>It is the only VISIBLE sign that covid19 is out there, for without it - we would never even know, care about or be concerned, because 99% of people out there are unaffected.</p>
<p>It also means that I am personally affected, as I am required to put the Stupid Mask on just so I can buy food, medicine or access essential services, and every time I must do so  - is an assault on my dignity as a PERFECTLY HEALTHY PERSON, and on my human rights to govern my own body.</p>
<p>If there is no ongoing 'emergency' or any government or health mandates in place, it becomes even more absurd.</p>
<p>This pandemic and resultant fears and resultant trampling of all our rights - YES YOURS AS WELL - began with The Mask, and will end with The Mask.</p>
<p>Because of The Mask and mass compliance, we know live in a world where Vaccine Passports and mass Surveillance are now  a very plausible reality.</p>
<p>This is why I and others have hated The Mask since day one. Not only is it ineffective against a 'highly contagious airborne killer virus variant', but has also made this go on longer than it should and has contribute to mandatory Vaccination and Vax Passports.</p>

        <p>This comment belongs in the Guinness Book of fucking idiots.</p>

<p>Why do I care? Because you aren't following the science <em>like you're supposed to.</em></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>\&rt;makes people <em>feel</em> safer</p>
<p>Yeah, science doesn't care about your feelings. That's not science.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>\&rt;they're being safe</p>
<p>The science literally tells you there is no danger so there is no ''being safe.''</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>\&rt;fuck off and wear a mask</p>
<p>The full circle. You succeeded in basing your entire counter on how <strong><em>you</em></strong> feel, which is honestly pretty selfish. I honestly think you could be a bot. What's 10+8 divided by 2? I hope you enjoyed commenting here because you're banned from a handful of subreddits now.</p>
