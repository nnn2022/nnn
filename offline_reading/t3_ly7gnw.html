    <strong>The Death of Entertainment</strong>
    <p><p>I suppose to a lot of people, what I'm about to say might sound petty or stupid. But it isn't to <em>me</em>. SO far from it.</p>
<p>Last night I found out that my all-time favorite concert venue has closed for good. Of course they couldn't make it, how do you survive when you can't host events for an entire year? That venue... was so special to me. I saw probably a hundred shows there, over the years. ALL of my favorite bands played there, it was the go-to for my favorite music genre. And now it's just... gone. One of so, so many.</p>
<p>I spent last night an emotional wreck. Couldn't stop crying, deeply depressed, just a mess. I woke up looking like someone had punched me in the face, my eyes were so swollen from all the pathetic sobbing. I spent today in a weird fog. I feel... numb? I've spent AN ENTIRE FUCKING YEAR daydreaming about getting to go back to that venue, to see my favorite bands again. But I guess it took being pummeled over the head with such devastating news, to realize...?</p>
<p>Entertainment is gone. Live music is dead. Bands can't play unless they have a venue to play <em>in</em>. They can't tour if you lock the world down forever. Who's gonna have the money now, to get the smaller venues going again? I don't go to arena shows that draw thousands of people. I'm talking like, venues that can accommodate a few hundred, at most. Honestly? I wouldn't be surprised if the bands all just break up. I mean, what's the point? Sure, you can maybe still record stuff (I guess secretly?; if they get together in the studio they're gonna kill like 50 grandmas or something), but they can't tour or promote their new music on the road.</p>
<p>I feel ZERO sense of hope, anymore. I've lost an entire year of my life. Everything that made life worth living, that made me feel joy and happiness, is just gone. I've been DEEPLY suicidal, particularly in the last couple of months. You see the shit on the "news", all the lies and fearmongering. The "it's just until...!" nonsense. I mean, fuck, the 'vaccine' was supposed to be the goal, right? But now? Oh, no, don't possibly think of living your life, even if you've been vaccinated! Wear your multiple masks and social distance and stay at home, like a good little drone! How DARE you want to LIVE, instead of EXIST? Bigot! Murderer! </p>
<p>God, I'm tired. I'm fucking exhausted. I've stopped caring about, well, anything. I used to be a good cook. I was the sort of person who loved playing with all the fun kitchen gadgets. Air fryer, Instant Pot, etc. Goodness, those things have been sitting and collecting dust for months. Right now, I have cheap ramen, bread, and peanut butter and jelly. I don't care about food anymore. I don't even WANT to eat. I've turned myself into a raging alcoholic, because getting drunk is really the only thing to do? </p>
<p>Isn't it funny, before the world went insane, 'woke' people would screech about mental health? But... nobody cares about that, anymore. Nobody cares that I spend most days wishing I was dead. That I'm constantly anxious and depressed and lonely. But hey, as soon as I say something like "I hate the masks, I feel like I'm suffocating and it makes me anxious and panicky" (100% true), I'm a grandma killing, murdering, piece of shit.</p>
<p>I can't go on like this. I can't spend every single day, trapped, with NOTHING to live for. It's not about a concert venue. It's about losing ALL hope that life will ever again be anything meaningful or good. I'd rather die than live in a world that tells me I'm a selfish murderer for simply just wanting to live my life as I always have, for the nearly 40 years of my existence.</p>
<p>I can certainly imagine the responses, to this. "JUST KILL YOURSELF YOU GROSS PIECE OF SHIT!!". Oh, trust me, I think about that on the daily. But hey, again, I'm just one person who doesn't matter to anyone. Until I question the bullshit, of course. And then I'm a selfish, murdering asshole who should die.</p>
<p>...Is it weird to fantasize about the ways to kill yourself? Suppose I've come up with some weird ones. I really just... don't want to exist, anymore. Not like this. Never like this.</p></p>
