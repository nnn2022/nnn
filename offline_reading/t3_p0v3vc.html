    <strong>The C-D-C's Plan to Put Americans in Camps, in Their Words</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/global-covid-19/shielding-approach-humanitarian.html#r1">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/global-covid-19/shielding-approach-humanitarian.html#r1</a></p>
<p>This is over a year old, but don't think for a second they wouldn't consider someone unjabbed to qualify as a "high risk individual." This ominous plan is more pertinent today than ever, and perhaps the greatest threat to freedom Americans have ever faced in our nation's history.</p>
<p>I recommend reading and re-reading the whole thing, but here are some direct quotes for the TLDR crowd:</p>
<p><em>This document presents considerations from the perspective of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention (CDC) for implementing the shielding approach in humanitarian settings as outlined in guidance documents focused on</em> <strong><em>camps</em></strong>, displaced populations and low-resource settings.</p>
<p><em>...</em></p>
<p><em>High-risk individuals would be temporarily relocated to safe or ‚Äúgreen zones‚Äù established at the household, neighborhood, camp/sector or community level depending on the context and setting. They would have minimal contact with family members and other low-risk residents.</em></p>
<p>...</p>
<p><em>Camp/Sector Level:</em></p>
<p><em>A group of shelters such as schools, community buildings within a camp/sector (max 50 high-risk individuals per single green zone) where high-risk individuals are physically isolated together.</em></p>
<p><em>One entry point is used for exchange of food, supplies, etc. A meeting area is used for residents and visitors to interact while practicing physical distancing (2 meters).</em> <strong><em>No movement into or outside the green zone.</em></strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p><em>Dedicated staff need to be identified to monitor each green zone. Monitoring includes both adherence to protocols and potential adverse effects or outcomes due to isolation and stigma.</em> <strong><em>It may be necessary to assign someone within the green zone, if feasible, to minimize movement in/out of green zones.</em></strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p><em>Isolation/separation from family members, loss of freedom and personal interactions may require additional psychosocial support structures/systems.</em></p>
<p>...</p>
<p><em>Separating families and disrupting and deconstructing multigenerational households may have long-term negative consequences.</em> (ya think?)</p>
<p>If you still think this is for our safety, I have no words. </p>
<p>Please <strong>read</strong>, <strong>archive</strong>, and <strong>share</strong> this everywhere. Please prepare yourselves and your families - physically, mentally, and spiritually. We all need to be doing everything we can to avoid this authoritarian nightmare from coming to fruition. We all need to do our part and stand up for our human right's right NOW. Make your voices heard. </p>
<p>I love each and every one of you who are choosing the side of good in this struggle, and keep sharing positive energy.</p>
<p><strong>We will win because we must win.</strong></p></p>

        <p>We the control group MUST HOLD STRONG AND NOT COMPLY TO VACCINATIONS!</p>
<p>It's going to be intense in the upcoming few months. And when the vax start destroying natural immunity/antibodies, causing vax deaths / injuries, causing spread of SUPER COVAIDS / vax resistant variants,</p>
<p>It's going to be PAINFULLY OBVIOUS that the vaccines are causing more harm than good.</p>
<p>STAY STRONG AND DIAMOND HANDS HOLD U APES! üíéüíçü¶ßüë´ü§ù</p>
<p>WE CAN WIN THIS SCAMDEMIC!</p>
<p>Also the Pro Vax will win because NOW THEY CAN CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT THOSE VAX PUSHERS TO OBLIVION AND GET HUGE PAYOUTS AND COMPENSATIONS!!!!</p>

        <p>I sometime wonder if the coming, cumulative compensation from vaccine injuries will contribute to the death of the dollar, via hyperinflation. Economic Impact Payments got the ball rolling and the time may be coming to drive the final nail.. Everyone will be compensated, but it will be with worthless dollars. If this is the case, hard assets and PM‚Äôs will be the place to be! Interesting times to say the least...</p>

<p>They are talking about people already living in camps (i.e. homeless camps).  Not putting people in camps.</p>
<p>"Forcibly displaced populations residing in camps or camp-like settings may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 epidemics due to overcrowding, poor access to safe water and sanitation and limited access to health services. </p>
<p>In the absence of control measures, camps and camp-like settings could experience very high attack rates and mortality. "</p>

        <p>This is still valuable information though, as it highlights their "belief" that this will ravage the homeless community. How's yours doing in your city? They all falling dead in the street...or is the population actually just increasing?</p>

        <p>Baltimore here.  Homeless population has taken over downtown.  But it's mostly because everyone else left to work at home in the suburbs.  Yeah it's like the Walking Dead in downtown Baltimore.</p>

        <p>Do you really want the govt putting people in camps? For any reason? Ever? That sets an incredibly dangerous precedent. </p>
<p>If they cared about homeless, they'd stop printing infinity money and locking down the global economy. This is about control, and perhaps much worse.</p>
