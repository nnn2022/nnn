    <strong>Anyone else sensing the desperation from the system to get everybody jabbed and complying?</strong>
    <p><p>At first when the 'vaccine' came out this year I had the opinion to wait a couple years to see how safe and effective it really is. Now - given the last few weeks I never want to take it.</p>
<p>Not just because of the mounting evidence this 'vaccine' is not what they're telling us it is - but because of the DESPRATE push to get as many people jabbed asap. This involves blatant propaganda, censorship and gaslighting on a major global scale.</p>
<p>I have two takes on the recent establishment desperation -</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There are many more of us ("anti-vaxxers") out there than we are being led to believe. Because of various other issues we've been unable to organize effectively. This is now changing, and the propaganda is matching the rise of "the awakened". Think something along the lines of "if the situation was hopeless their propaganda would be unnecessary."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 'vaccine' is nefarious in some form - and with the mounting credible evidence becoming progressively undeniable, the establishment is trying to get as many jabbed as possible before the illusion breaks.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It seems to me that there are cracks appearing in the wall, and they don't have enough fingers to plug all the holes at once if that makes sense. 
It seems like TPTB are on the clock, for what reason I can't say. 
Could be other reasons for it too. What's your take?</p></p>
