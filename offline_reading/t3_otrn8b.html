        <p>This man has been the most arrogant rude person and complained about anyone with legit concerns about the shot. He has made fun of and name called some pretty awful things. Can't say I'm happy he's having a rude awakening right now at all because it sucks for everyone involved. The vaccines are not what they have been telling people they're not vaccines at all. I hope more people start seeing this and that those of us who have been paying attention all along already knew what he just figured out. We should be on the same page supporting one another not fighting and blaming like this. Your fellow man is NOT the one you should be blaming and mad at.</p>

        <p>He sees himself as a hero for getting injected. This must have been a shock to go from hero to zero. And I think there are truly some wonderful people out there who did get the vaccine because they genuinely do care about other people and love their families and friends Etc. I don't think everyone that gets it is on an ego trip I think a lot of people do it because they think it's the right thing and I feel terrible for them to have this Awakening that it's not what they think it is. But please have a little respect for those of us who did not get injected in the first place because we've been paying attention and listening to a lot of different news sources and we saw this before you did.</p>

        <p>He clearly has some mental health issues. He's no freaking hero by any means. The ones that warned people (doctors, scientists) right from the start are. Those who lost their reputation because of people like him, the MSM, Fraudci, Gates and others. But guess what, the tables are turning, slow but steadily.</p>

        <p>I seriously hope so, they're just going to keep blaming us, we're the evil ones to them we are the reason they're in this mess. Even though he seems to realize it's the actual vaccine and it has nothing to do with us here I could see him flipping once they start putting the blame on us again</p>

        <p>Just like in 1933. "Beware of the Jewish, they spread all parasites and diseases". They complied, wore the yellow star and what happened? It got worse and worse. No matter how bad the situation already is, we can't back down. We can't comply to this nonsense and we can't be fearful. There's way too much at stake.</p>

        <p>I agree with everything you're saying and let me tell you when I first watched this I was like OMG this is like Christmas and my birthday all at once lol but I had to override that and realize that if this is ever going to stop and we're ever going to have any sort of decent world again we have to stop being on opposite sides and come together somewhere in the middle and fight our common enemy. It's extremely hard to do when you've been called a dumb troglodyte for the better part of a year and a half now but I know for me I need to personally put that aside and hope that people snap out of this insane spell they're under and realize what's really going on.</p>

        <p>I think you're right, somebody posted here earlier today that Douglas Murray said exactly this. I don't want to believe it, it's too horrible to think about but he's probably right. We have some awful years ahead we're going to have to figure out how to get through this. This makes me so sad, we are losing years of Our Lives to this. We are going to have to figure out how to have some sort of decent life like millions of people did before us during wartime and other tough times. Most of us have never lived through something like this where you have to figure it out as we go along. I think at a certain point a lot of us will become desensitized with some of what's going on.</p>

        <p>I pretty much have been. I've been a full time live streamer since 2012 so already been working from home full time for over a decade. Hardly going out. And now all this. </p>
<p>I've lost so many viewers (100s) and "friends" for speaking my mind, all trying to make them think about things. I've become completely desensitized to loyalty since I've seen how thin most relationships are. </p>
<p>Fortunately I have an incredible community of people that do see what's going on but its not the majority of people. Its hard wanting more for people than they want for themselves.</p>

        <p>I can totally relate, this entire situation has really outed people for what they really are and what they think of you and themselves. I am a rehab therapist and there have been a couple of times in my career where I have said to a patient you can't expect others to care more about you than you care about yourself. I feel that way now about a lot of people. You can't do the caring for them it's up to them. And I have a very small handful of friends who are on the same page as me and I treasure them now more than ever. I never realized how important they were to me and how lucky I am to know them. The people that I was previously the closest to I barely speak to now. It has radically changed everything. I'm trying to have faith in this shift happening as a means of opening up every other areas of my life. I guess we'll see about that. I wish you the very best of luck with everything!</p>

<p>I've even been considering finding someone to talk to. Whether a psychiatrist or some sort of mentor. Right now my best escape has been writing my own series of novels where I can spread my message through fictional characters. I literally have one thst mocks and berates people ignorantly injecting themselves because the government told them to. </p>
<p>They are portrayed as the "villian" but I'm betting people will see their point of view as he is essentially fighting to take down the system.</p>

        <p>Thank you so much for saying that! At a certain point I was thinking I really need to talk to someone too but where I live every therapist is completely woke and they would judge me and it would only make things worse. Sadly I don't think therapy is even an option for me here so I just talked to my like-minded friends and try to work things out like that.  I like what you're doing it sounds very therapeutic and I bet it's helping you more than you realize! We have to do whatever we can to make it through this!</p>

        <p>Exactly.  The anti-vaxx have been ridiculed, told we don’t believe in science long enough.  Many literally want to deny medical aid to the unvaxxed, going as far as hoping we die.  Less voters, Darwin is gonna get us, etc.
Unlike them, I sincerely hope nothing bad happens to them, I don’t wish sickness on them.  However, I do hope they wake up and realize what a nothing burger that jab was.  That maybe enough comes around they can start respecting others beliefs.</p>

But keep in mind that even if they think they're better than us who reject the vax, even if they're calling us names and even if they want us to be banned from "their" society, we are better than that. We shouldn't get to the exact same level of ignorance they're throwing at us for months. We have to outsmart them. We all know what Jesus Christ said, turn the other check when somebody strikes you. It's not about how hard you can hit but how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done. That's from Rocky Balboa, but basically what Jesus said. And that's what we should do. Keep moving forward. We can't stop, even if we're proven right 10000 times. More than ever. There's no point of return. We're going to win this, but there's a lot of work ahead of us.</p>

        <p>Damn I had such a smile on my face when I saw that earlier! Michael comes off like an asshole preaching on Twitter. When I saw this video I wanted to comment and steal his insult “you got played like a fool Michael, ya big dummy you!”.

        <p>Yes! I saw a recent video with him walking around in the street literally preaching about how important it is to do this and how anyone who doesn't do it is a selfish idiot, amongst a whole host of insults toward us. I have to say this was satisfying to watch although I don't think he's going to take the final leap and realize there's something much bigger going on here. He is such a nasty mean person, he is blinded by his inability to open up his mind and look around him and start putting two and two together.</p>

        <p>Well hopefully this opens more peoples eyes to how arrogant and condescending they’ve been to people that refused to get this “vaccine” (it obviously doesn’t work as advertised) I’m sure most people will continue being insufferable assholes, but maybe, just maybe more people will start realizing they’ve Ben lied to and are being used. Pretty crazy to me how governments around the world have spent tons of our taxes on an ineffective treatments and want to continue with boosters and new vaccines now. This shit isn’t going away until more people say no more.</p>

<p>Trump Derangement Syndrome. It's how people are obsessed with criticising him and thinking that everyone who doesn't buy BlueAnon conspiracy theories like, "Russia Did It," "Safest Elections In US History" or "Confiscate The Guns" is associated with Trump.</p>

        <p>OMG he does have the worst TDS I've ever seen he doesn't shut up about it and he's completely irrational! I mean I'm not a huge Trump fan myself but his Venom and the amount of time he spends going on and on about it is absolutely pathological. He's so angry all the damn time and the way he basically calls everyone else stupid constantly is pretty ironic considering the situation here.</p>

        <p>I have always thought this guy was horrible.  However, I will give him credit for at least admitting this much.  I'll also give him credit for blaming Fauci, et.al., instead of blaming unvaccinated people.</p>
<p>I think this was a big step and a really brave video to make.  No one confronted with a truth they strongly opposed for a long time is able to just change right away.  It's always a process.  It happens in steps.  I hope he gets the rest of the way there.</p>

        <p>Although big Pharma always told them, that it doesn’t stop the vaccinated from being infected and spreading the virus, people lining up for it didn’t want to hear that. If you said them that the manufacturer doesn’t grant the stop of the spread, you were deemed a crazy conspiracy theorist. These people don’t want to hear the truth.</p>

        <p>And it's not a traditional vaccine at least the MRNA ones aren't. I said this to so many people and they yell at me and tell me I'm an idiot even when I explain why it's not a traditional vaccine and it's not going to do the things a traditional vaccine do.

        <p>Yeah, I am fairly certain I was slapped with some weird 1 week shadowban. My username was no longer displaying karma and when I hovered over my name I had actually lost a bunch of karma. Not that I care (I stopped caring years, especially after 2018). But it was strange. I had a few upvotes here and there, mostly everything sitting at 1. Couldn't find the recent* comment that lost me the karma out of curiosity. Anyway, my username is showing karma again and suddenly I have 1.5k extra karma that just poofed out of nowhere. </p>
<p>And I am fairly certain it was because I was reported for "misinformation". For talking about how vaccinated individuals have a 50/50 chance whether they stop transmission, roughly the same chance as a placebo. </p>
<p>And that because of this the entire idea is to create a populace dependent on shots to live because this will create super variants that will kill the unvaccinated. </p>
<p>Last week it was fake news and getting bans for it. </p>
<p>This week its the headline news on fox and cnn.</p>
<p>I literally do not have any faith left in the average stranger. None whatsoever.</p>

        <p>I’m confused about something. Didn’t the elite with all their A.I. technology and super intelligent scientists predict that if they kept pushing the mask even on the vaccinated that we would eventually call them on it and turn their own ideals back on them? You’re really telling me they didn’t think about this before implementing it?</p>
<p>I am beginning to think this whole thing has to be one of 2 scenarios. Either they don’t have all the super powered brain machines we give them credit for using against us and they are just a bunch of fucktards with money or this is all part of the grand scheme. What if they’e just making yet another scapegoat evil villain out of fauci and his ilk to be the target of extermination after they kill everyone’s friends and family with this vaccine bullshit. Let’s not forget that they’re supposed ultimate goal endgame is to usher in a new one world government and if the majority is us then maybe we’re the ones being set up here. All I’m saying is be vigilant and wary of your own ego.</p>
