        <p>Nice to see another Puerto Rican around here! </p>
<p>No one in my immediate family has caught it. I have a pretty substantial circle of friends and no one has caught it there. I’ve been working in my office for almost a year now, with 3 to 4 people sitting in a small room with no windows and also going out for lunch breaks every day and none of us have caught it either. </p>
<p>Perplexed to say the least.</p>

        <p>I’ve had covid for about 2 weeks. Didn’t even know till last Saturday when I lost my taste and smell. That’s it. No temperature no cough no shortness of breath. And I’m a 40 year old moderately heavy drinker and vaper with a shit diet and who does no exercise. Literally had worse colds</p>

        <p>That's really sad. Fortunately, no one I know yet has died from either, although a guy who had covid and decided to get the vax a week later, and just got his second shot has been horribly sick after both shots.  Still sheeping it up, though.</p>

        <p>I know one single person..... and he had zero symptoms. Only reason he found out was because he was a front line worker and had to take a mandatory Covid test. This was last winter during the regular flu season, so if there was a time to get the rona it would be then. I’m no scientist but rona to me is just a new strain of a flu bug......... this “pandemic” is out of control. I am so tired of the virtue signaling</p>

        <p>My sister tested positive last summer. Her only symptom was that she was pissed off for having to miss work and not get to see her daughter for 2 weeks. </p>
<p>I'm almost certain I had a flu like thing back before Covid was a thing (Nov 2019). I just took some DayQuil for awhile and kept going to work.   </p>
<p>My teenage son was quarantined due to contract tracing at school. While quarantined, he developed some of the minor symptoms (like cold/flu symptoms pretty much), we didn't get him tested. He got to play video games and watch the Master's Tournament all week while being excused from school. Poor kid.</p>

        <p>I only know two people who know more than one person who has had it. </p>
<p>Everybody my wife knows has described it as a bad flu for a few days and has fully recovered.</p>
<p>A Swedish friend of mine told me that she and her family know hundreds of people combined who have had it. Again, they all described it as a bad flu which only lasted for a few days. </p>
<p>However, my Swedish friend's boyfriend apparently has long lasting lung damage from the virus. Because one person out of the 'hundreds' of infected people she knows has long term damage, she wishes that Sweden had placed more restrictions on their citizens' lives.</p>
<p>Probably worth noting that her boyfriend recovered from lung cancer in 2019 and started smoking again in 2020. Although she can't see the connection...</p>

        <p>No it's not normal. Healthy people with no symptoms are being tested with a test that is literally giving mostly false positives and the high number of tests is used as justification for all the lockdowns, masks, mass vaccination efforts.</p>

        <p>I got it myself. For 2 days I felt kinda bad (no fever or anything, just tired) and afterwards I just had a mildly uncomfortable feeling in my throat, that was it. Noone else I know has had it, even people that never wear masks and were literally going to a party every weekend.</p>

        <p>My wife and I just got pregnant for the first time and consulted her doctor about the vaccine. I had already decided I wasn’t going to get it and suggested to my wife that she do the same, but that I wouldn’t push her to do something she didn’t want to do if she thought it was best for our baby. Doctor said she strongly recommended getting it and my wife and I just said “oh okay, we’ll think about it.” Left the doctor’s office and went home and my wife told me she wasn’t sure she wanted to get it after all. Now, weeks later, with all the menstrual cycle disasters happening to young women, my wife is extremely grateful that she made that decision. It’s probable that we would have lost our child and potentially any chance to have another one in the future.</p>

        <p>If it was a real pandemic the government and the media wouldn't have to constantly threaten us and beat us over the head to take it seriously.  They wouldn't have to mandate wearing masks and social distancing because everyone would be doing that already because we would all know people who had gotten sick or died and hospitals really would be overrun.  </p>
<p>Personally I don't know of anyone who has so much as tested positive let alone gotten seriously sick from it.</p>

        <p>I haven't cheered anything. I hate the lockdowns and I think they're devastating to human life. I live in the UK, my government could have acted sooner and prevented such a long lockdown. They could have also provided far more support for businesses and workers. The fact of the matter is that this virus is real and it's dangerous and has killed millions of people. No government would shoot its own economy in the head over nothing, in fact my government has done everything it can to act as late as possible because it doesn't want to lockdown for this very reason. Our politician's wealth is usually yknow dependent on there not being a great depression. Regardless, it's hard not to lockdown when 30k plus covid patients are in hospital at our peak with no ICU beds and hardly any beds left for any other patients. The hospitals just aren't empty, at least during peaks. It is categorically impossible to hide this fact from people, and a few cases of empty wards and doctors on the internet saying they're empty without any proof isn't good enough evidence to conclude this is fake. If the hospitals were empty there would either be tens of thousands of healthcare professionals speaking up or there would be tens of thousands of healthcare professionals paid to keep quiet which is unlikely. It's just impossible to hide this secret and not end up with the vast majority of watchdogs, scientists, statisticians, and healthcare professionals figuring it out. I get the pandemic is scary and having our rights taken away is scary, we should never trust the state taking our rights way, but inventing a happier reality where the pandemic isn't real and people are sheep that have fallen for lies isn't going to change fact.</p>

        <p>All the hospitals  have been completely empty every time I went I’ve been 5 times 3 times were for surgeries where I stayed multiple nights I live in the most poluated city and I was pretty much the only patient in there ,I’ve seen at least 100 hundred videos of people walking around hospitals and them being completely empty .Also disagree with everything else you’ve said your beyond delusional keep thinking the great reset isn’t real and that big daddy government care about you and wouldn’t destroy the economy .the doctors who disagree or tell the truth are banned or have to deal with consequences ,yes doctors are getting paid to lie about numbers and the ones who are honest you don’t get to see because most of the time they get banned.</p>

        <p>Sorry anecdotal evidence won't work for me. You got proof that these hospitals have been consistently empty? Have you got proof that covid wards weren't shut off from other wards?</p>
<p>I didn't say the government cares about us. They care about their own interests and tanking the global economy is against their own interests. </p>
<p>How many doctors have been banned for speaking up about covid? Have you got a source? How many doctors have spoken up about covid? If there was a global conspiracy I'd expect to see tens of thousands of doctors speaking up by now, I'd expect to see hospital inspectors speaking up, cleaning staff speaking up, watchdogs speaking up, on a mass scale. This isn't happening though is it?</p>

        <p>The vast majority of infections will not be known to the individual.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/covid-19-world-in-for-a-hell-of-a-ride-in-coming-months-dr-mike-ryan-says-1.4370626">WHO</a> estimates that 750m people have been infected by covid based on antibody test results on Oct. 2, 2020. Worldometer has 35,555,600  cases as of Oct 2, 2020.</p>
<p>But, not every infection results in antibodies. Many studies show around 30% of the population have T-cell reactivity to the spike protein and are able to eliminate it before it can develop into a symptomatic case. </p>
<p>In other words, it was likely that around 1b people had infected as of Oct 2, 2020, but only 3.5% were officially aware of it.</p>

        <p>Completely normal I think. I do know a family friend that passed away from it but he was 300+ lbs and had heart issues didn’t go to the hospital and died in his sleep. Both my parents 60+ and my dad had heart issues tested positive then tested negative the next day. Did 2 weeks of quarantine and never showed any symptoms at all. The only reason they got tested was because my mom was scheduled to have foot surgery and it was a requirement.</p>

        <p>I lost taste/smell for 3-4 days. It was probably covid because I never had that happen before. But other than that, I felt fine &amp; still had my energy, so I never bothered to get tested. I’m not buying into the fear mongering. I refuse the vaccine too because I never get sick, &amp; even if I do once every couple years, it’s just something minor like a stuffy nose.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately my mother and uncle both died from it (technically the complications from it).</p>
<p>I had it. For me, it was a stuffy nose. I had 3 other friends who had it (one of whom lost her mind from just PTSD after even though she never had serious symptoms). Whats amazing is that none of our families contracted it from us.</p>

        <p>Nope I do not know one single person who has died from it. </p>
<p>My daughter had a high temp in December, had to take her for a test which I had to do on her myself in my car and watch her cry the whole way through..the test came back negative.</p>
<p>I had a really bad cough over december which may or may not have been covid but I never bothered getting tested because it was no worse that prior chest infections I've had. I just rested and got on with shit.</p>
<p>I recently checked my countries (Scotland) death rate and a total of 22 people in my age range (35-39) have apparently died from covid. </p>

        <p>It could be normal, but that might depend on the area you live in/how many people you typically interact with. Ex, I live in a very highly populated area and I know a few people who got sick. From what I heard/saw it was basically like having the flu. They weren't about to drop dead. I may or may not have gotten sick, but I didn't bother getting tested and it was basically like having a minor fever. Definitely not worth shutting all of the businesses down for.</p>

        <p>We know a handful- only 1 serious case, a friend of the family, male, 67 years old with terminal cancer (1-2 years to live, on chemo to try to extend his outlook, but ultimately they believe it to be terminal). Spent 4 days in the hospital on O2 and got convalescent plasma. Has made a full recovery from covid and did not seem to hasten his cancer outlook. The other few were mild to moderate flu-like symptoms. I’ll note we own an essential business and were open face to face the entire time, never caught it and only a couple customers out of hundreds mentioned they had ever caught it.</p>

        <p>I know 20+ ppl who were infected, including my parents and several close friends. Most had very mild symptoms. I did know one lady who passed away after contracting it, but she was in the last stages of lung cancer. The worst part for her was that she died alone due to these ridiculous protocols.</p>

<p>Also known as "died of covid". Cancer patients were having treatments cancelled left right and centre, dying, then rona is getting whacked on the death certificate because of 'suspected covid' due to them being 'unwell when they died'.</p>

        <p>What is your social circle like? I had two deaths and an additional three infections. Both the people who died were under 60. One over 60 had no symptoms, two in their 50s were really sick for a week and then fine.</p>

        <p>I only know one person who even tested positive. But she tested positive when her husband didn't. Re-tested immediately and came up negative.</p>
<p>I played in an underground sports league throughout the summer and into the fall of 2020. One hundred people, no masks, everyone hugging each other (we're all friends). Did any of us get Covid? Maybe, but we sure as hell never knew about it if we did. Some people in the league were required to be tested for work and nobody came up positive as far as I know.</p>

        <p>Well i know one person who died “with covid” (older overweight likely diabetes plus asthma - sad but these are the typical comorbities. Plus he chose to go on ventilator bc it was “hard to breathe”  thinking hed come off...  or knowing he wouldnt?!  Not sure what would have happened if he stuck it out without. Again its sad but he wasnt very healthy and mid late 70s) and another much younger and healthy who died from the vaccine. 🧐</p>

        <p>Same here. 14 people i know tested positive but at most they had a bad throat for few days. </p>
<p>I know 2 people who died. They were old(one in 90s and one in 100s) and had couple medical conditions. I guess any disease would kill them. Also they weren't even in a covid positive environment. They were in a secular part of a village. After the hospital checked their body they wrote "death by covid". Too suspicious to not think.</p>

        <p>My aunt <em>thinks</em> she had it but didn’t test positive. No loss of smell or taste symptoms. My dad tested positive <em>after</em> he got the vaccine a couple weeks ago. A hypochondriac lady I work with thinks she had it too. That’s literally it in my entire extended family and network of friends and acquaintances, probably at least 90-100 people.

        <p>I’ve heard of a few people that I know, but am not on a texting basis with, but no one in my contact list, and certainly no one Im close with. My neighbor’s landlord tested positive. I did talk with him, and he basically got tested after he had a mild fever. He relaxed for a few days. I also heard that a girl I used to work with claims to have “long covid”, but I have no idea what that means.</p>
