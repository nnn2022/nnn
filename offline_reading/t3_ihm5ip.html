    <p><p>Similarly, if people had jobs to go to in the morning they probably wouldn't be burning down car dealerships. End the lockdowns and restore common sense.</p></p>

        <p>Exactly and it's a point I haven't seen talked about much.  The rioting, looting and unrest happening all over are a direct result of lockdowns.  Whether that is intentional or not is another discussion.  </p>
<p>We've had riots before but typically they quiet down after a few nights because people need to return to work, school and just have other things to do.  We have millions of younger people out of work and there has been literally nothing to do for months.  There hasn't even been any usual entertainment distractions like sports (until recently), movies, conventions, anything.</p>

        <p>While I admit it's kind of a slippery slope to include new normal to refer to things outside of Covid stuff, all of this seems related.  It seems like most of us just want to turn back the clock to at least the beginning of 2020.</p>

<p>It is WAY more normal. Our neighbors all hang out indoor without masks or social distancing. We have friends that go to breweries and hug and shake hands. </p>

        <p>Although I don't think you can easily connect all of the civil unrest to lockdowns etc, it seems pretty obvious that there is a connection between everyone being out of work with nothing to do and the anxiety created from the uncertainty.</p>
<p>You see the same thing in countries that end up having revolutions where there are way too many people out of work who are either desperate and/or having nothing better to do.</p>

<p>Maybe people are out of work, desperate, and with nothing to do because of the lockdowns? </p>

        <p>Yes yes yes! I am pro 2A and completely against these riots, but I still feel a little bit uncomfortable defending a 17 year old carrying a large AR into the riots. I know he shot in self defense, but the issue is - where were the police? Why was he there in the first place? I donâ€™t think he was a bad guy, but heâ€™s a naive high schooler who canâ€™t shouldâ€™ve been in school until he has grown to make wise decision. The issue is two fold - the lockdown makes for idle hands, and the inept politicians leading these cities are doing nothing to stop the violence, and are even encouraging them.</p>

        <p>&rt;I know he shot in self defense, but the issue is - where were the police? </p>
<p>Intentionally keeping their distance. This is a pattern we've been seeing across the United States. BLM protestors are allowed to rampage and destroy communities while the police watch from a distance and neglect to intervene until people start dying.</p>
<p>&rt;Why was he there in the first place?</p>
<p>Part of a local militia organized to protect property, defend bystanders, and administer emergency medical care, apparently. Organized in the context of the absence of police protection.</p>
<p>&rt;I donâ€™t think he was a bad guy, but heâ€™s a naive high schooler who canâ€™t shouldâ€™ve been in school until he has grown to make wise decision. </p>
<p>Agreed. He should be barred from owning a gun for a while and receive whatever punishments there are for illegal possession and under-aged open carry, whatever they are. He is too young to be playing such dangerous games, especially in the current political context. While he didn't travel far (Kenosha is like 30 minutes from where he lives, adjacent Chicago suburbs), it's not like he was defending his own home, or even his own city.</p>
<hr>
<p>Despite the context of his presence, however, he conducted himself well. He retreated until he was left with no option but to open fire. He even had the patience to withstand provocative language, several projectiles, blunt force weapons, kicks, and even a brandished pistol before he started firing (this is a non-exhaustive list of what he dealt with across both gunfire events). Most people would have started shooting long before Kyle chose to. </p>
<p>If Kyle gets the book thrown at him for his actions, then all of our rights to self-defense are jeopardized. And I highly agree with your point that the lockdown and insipid politicans are allowing this carnage to continue unchecked. It's a shame, and we may even lose more rights in the process as stupid people gamble them all away.</p>

        <p>I get that he technically shouldnâ€™t have been in possession of the gun at 17, but weâ€™re well past the point where that matters, imo. These rioters want literal war in the streets, and weâ€™re expected to adhere to arbitrary rules? Nah. Kyle should walk.</p>

        <p>Agreed. A lot of these debates have been railroaded into criticizing Kyle's presence and insinuating that he wanted blood, but if anything, his restraint during the evening showed that the last thing he wanted to do was to put a bullet in another human being. Even though he was attacked and cornered by the first rioter he killed, Kyle seemed genuinely shocked and guilty that he had to kill him in self-defense. Fast forward to the attempted lynching, and this kid was on the floor and on the verge of being savagely beaten before he fired again during the second engagement. </p>
<p>What everybody <em>should</em> be asking is why have our streets been turned into war zones, and why is nobody criticizing the decisions and character of the rioters? Every single person Kyle shot was an aggressive felon who, knowing they had the advantage in numbers and the media on their side, chose to rush the kid without any restraint whatsoever. What did they think would happen? Why were they allowed to roam free? Why is GoFundMe promoting their fundraising campaigns while shutting down Kyle's legal defense fund? </p>
<p>This whole event sickens me, from the events that transpired to the greater context it took place in. I really hope something is in the works for Kyle, and really America. This can't be allowed to continue.</p>
