    <strong>Some Musings on the Vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>Let me start by saying I have no intention of getting the vaccine. I do however know that 2 of the 3 members of my immediate family got it and have not experienced any side effects since taking the second dose several months ago. I also know of many people, particularly friends of friends, that have gotten the vaccine and were complaining about how sore and nauseous they were for days afterwards. Ditto for most of my coworkers who got the jab.</p>
<p>I don't think its poison like some claim it is. But it's certainly concerning that so many people are experiencing serious side effects and now the whole issue with cardiac arrest in young people, all of which is being swept under the rug by a coalition of the medical establishment, government, and pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<p>This raises the question of how effective the vaccine actually is. I'd wager not very effective, and in fact, I'd suspect that it's more of placebo than anything. In any case, if they're willing to lie to our faces about how safe it is, how can we expect them to be honest about the effectiveness?</p></p>

        <p>If you pay attention almost everything regarding this virus is suspect.</p>
<p>The fact that there are no panels of experts grilling eachother on seriously debatable topics during primetime news is evidence that we are being fed propaganda.</p>

        <p>I was  pro-vaccine for older people until May, and was even thinking about getting the vaccine myself.</p>
<p>Now, I’m becoming increasingly suspicious of the vaccines. I might become more sold on the vaccines by the end of this calendar year, but what would be the point of getting a vaccine by then? COVID should be gone by then, at least if the vaccines are effective.</p>

        <p>Exactly. The fact that the pandemic is effectively over and the guv'ment is still pushing hard for 100% vaccination is perhaps more alarming than anything</p>
<p>What steered me away from ever even considering getting the vaccine is the incessant nagging, round-the-clock propaganda, and celebrity endorsements. Fuck 'em</p>

        <p>My experience has been the majority of the people I know who got the vax had really bad reactions. I think I know two that didn’t (both older). My coworkers sit around at work comparing how bad their reactions were. I have a family member that was hospitalized from the vax, and a friend has a family member who is currently in multiple organ failure from catching Covid after getting double vaxxed. I don’t think anyone is trying to intentionally harm anyone, I just think with this being a brand new type of treatment there should have been substantially more long term studies before pushing it on people who probably don’t need it. I’m glad there is an option for high risk individuals, but I personally believe it should have stopped there until more peer reviewed and long term studies came out.</p>

<p>Hmm.  So that sounds good.</p>
<p>"The director of the U.S. CDC, Rochelle Walensky, said at a 1 July 2021 White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/07/01/press-briefing-by-white-house-covid-19-response-team-and-public-health-officials-43/">briefing</a> that preliminary data from January to June 2021 suggested that about 99.5% of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. occurred in unvaccinated people.</p>
<p>An Associated Press <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-941fcf43d9731c76c16e7354f5d5e187">analysis</a> of data from the CDC arrived at a similar conclusion. In May 2021, fully vaccinated people accounted for fewer than 1,200 (1.1%) hospitalizations and 150 (0.8%) deaths of the more than 100,000 total hospitalizations and 18,000 COVID-19 deaths reported in the U.S."</p>
<p>So, highly effective.  Not a placebo.</p>
