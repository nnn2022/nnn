    <strong>Oddballs?</strong>
    <p><p>When there are people who come to a sub such as this and they 'disagree' with the outlook that the sub is intended to cater for; I am wondering what possible reason might they have for doing such a thing? </p>
<p>One reason might be that the person is experiencing a species of denial - and that they are resisting pressure from their unconscious - and trying to push back down spontaneous urges to live in truth. In short; these are people who are in denial about what they really believe. </p>
<p>A second reason might be that they are professional operatives commissioned to disrupt and discredit the generation of authentic and coherent thought/resistance to the strategic agenda of their masters. Apart from those two reasons - I can think of no more. </p>
<ol>
<li>Can you think of any other reason they might come here?</li>
<li>What percentage split do you think exists between the two groups?</li>
</ol></p>
