        <p>Comment in English from the author:</p>
<p>This happened 2 days ago close to my home, my boyfriend's sister filmed the scene. Some acquaintances were spending some time together. A police patrol forced entry into their home for no apparent reason.
You can see on the first part of the video the mother filming the intrusion. One of the police officer got angry at her and throw her to the ground. She then got beat up by 2 police officers.
The second part of the video is filmed by my boyfriend's sister. You can see the mother on the floor covered with blood. The father also got threw to the floor and got beat up.
Their 3 children assisted to the scene (their 13yo girl too).</p>
<p>The mother is severely injured. She probably has deep brain damages.</p>
<p>The coronavirus and lockdown situation has changed our world. Fundamental rights are flouted in total indifference.
Police officers can now breaks into homes without warrant just because they reckon you do not respect the lockdown rules.
How long are we going to keep allowing our gouvernements such abuse of power?</p>
<p>Should I be scared now that every time that I spend some time with my family and friends, some police officers could just come into my home and harm us?
This is not the world in which I want to live in.</p>

<p>&rt; From that video alone I can't really judge. Breaking the corona rules and screaming against the police probably indicates they resisted arrest. Using excessive force is obviously bad on the side of the police, but I really am past the point of having any sympathy with people who blatantly break the rules.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>&rt; Cool down, as far as we know the mothe slipped or there was a scuffle and ended up fucking her nose up. She isn't dead not even near it. This family was in the wrong and like most of people that broke the law today, they tend to use their cellphones to spin a story.</p>

        <p>Are these people trying to justify police brutality by saying “She broke the law”?</p>
