    <strong>Work Place Bias</strong>
    <p><p>I just want to say I‚Äôm really grateful for this group. I joined when there was 40k members and now it‚Äôs at 60k and growing! More and more people are waking up to the TRUTH. My job is offering incentives (paid time off, compensation) if employees get vaccinated. Bias bullshit! Employers should NOT provide their medical opinion and they should NOT treat those who choose not to get vaccinated as less deserving. They also want us to download a tracking app on our cell phones so we can fill out a daily assessment, even though majority of us work home. (???) I also laugh at the weekly covid emails we get saying if we get sick or come in contact with it, we should contact HR immediately. LOL, yeah work would be the first thing I think about. Not. </p>
<p>I want to have hope but it seems life is forever changed by this. I‚Äôve lost out on every holiday with my family, fun events have been canceled, and I refuse to get tested so I can‚Äôt travel anywhere by plane. I believe this virus is real but the media has been caught telling too many lies with their scare-tactics. There are other much more serious and life-threatening illnesses than this one. </p>
<p>Thank you for reading.</p></p>

        <p>I don‚Äôt know how hard it is to find a different workplace with what work you do, but I wouldn‚Äôt want to stay in a place that bribes you with a vaccine. That‚Äôs just unethical and none of their business.</p>

        <p>I know, I was so disappointed when I heard them say this. It‚Äôs a great company to work for. I would hate to quit but if things get worse, I‚Äôll have to do what‚Äôs best for myself.</p>
