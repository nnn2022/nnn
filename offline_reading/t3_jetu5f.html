        <p>In my limited experience, an individual is extremely outgunned in trying to manage constructive discussion on this issue. What you're up against is a massive disinformation and propaganda campaign and pure fear. You would have to be a near-master orator and brilliantly articulate to even have a chance at success. There is just no competing. People will claim to be open-minded and welcome the discussion but will continually wield propaganda talking point after talking point. They don't even know they're doing it. They think what they're presenting is scientific evidence they've come across. They think they're demonstrating critical thinking but when they don't really know what true scientific evidence or true critical thinking is there really aren't any tools to help you unwind them.</p>

        <p>I want to be honest here: my goal is civil resistance, I don't care about their opinions that are copied from the government. I want them to find loopholes in jurisdiction and exploit them to undermine the country's measures.</p>
<p>I disagree with your statement, please hear me out, why. </p>
<p>As I wrote, they behave like nazis.</p>
<p>As insulting people on stage is a proven method to change their thinking, comparing people to nazis right in front of them to then elaborate why that is, might do the trick.</p>
<p>Those people are hypnotized by mass media and a huge amount also by their peers and fear of being outcast.</p>
<p>Fear of being outcast also plays into your hands if you frame them as nazis. First they might say, they were no nazis, but the more you show them with easily understandable verbal pictures how they become nazis, who the "jews" are in this picture, you could create cognitive dissonance as in "Corona is dangerous said the government but the government also said jews were dangerous without having proof for that" is the start.</p>

        <p>IMO, they behave more like Maoists than Nazis.  Read up on the "Great Leap Forward" and the ensuing Cultural Revolution of the 60s.</p>
<p>&rt; As insulting people on stage is a proven method to change their thinking</p>
<p>In China these were called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struggle_session">struggle sessions.</a> IMO, we're watching a sort of neo-Maoist cultural revolution take place.</p>
<p>You could also more easily draw parallels to Stalinist program of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dekulakization">Dekulakization,</a> in which the Ukranian Kulaks, land-owning farmers, were villainized, scapegoated and ultimately left to starve by the tens of millions after their food was confiscated and "collectivized" for the common good.</p>
<p>Dig into the details of previous leftist revolutions and you'll see modern-day parallels that will keep you up at night.</p>

        <p>I don’t know.  I’ve had people at work bashing those who don’t wear masks or do so reluctantly  and discussions similar to what OP relates ensue.   I keep my mouth shut because I find it too frustrating—and really disappointing—to be the odd man out trying to encourage people to keep an open mind and evaluate all the data, not just that which confirms their belief.</p>

        <p>Next time you reply "I don't believe in masks. I only believe in jesus christ, my saviour". Obviously you don't give a shit about religion(At least I wouldn't if I said it). The idea is to counter a strong shaming approach(how dare you not wear a mask, do you want to kill us) with a strong shaming approach(how dare you say worldly things were more important than religion, do you want to go to hell).</p>
<p>In general, this is the best approach: shame them harder than the government.</p>

        <p>it’s conflicting because despite their brainwashing, if you continue your arguments, it could wake someone up. if it plants the seed in someone’s head, the idea that this isn’t normal, they could then be brave enough to do the same with others.  but the conflict lies in trying to talk to these people.  it’s mentally exhausting...</p>

        <p>I really feel that when you are a well spoken, articulate, and well put together individual, going about your business ''face out'', that speaks for itself. Soon the word will be no longer able to be suppressed that the masks don't work, in the meantime just go about your life.</p>

        <p>You contribute to your own suffering by not standing up to them. The very reason why they become stronger and stronger is because of a mentality like yours. And you will be the one injected with bill gates' poison forcefully.</p>
<p>This is serious.</p>
<p>Take a stand.</p>

        <p>I just lives my life so far. Not wearing masks in class room, grocery store, malls, restaurants, clubs etc. and still meeting friends, going to the evening club with college, going to school etc. Instead of discussing with "everyone" and arguing, I just live my life.</p>
<p>None can tell me to wear a mask in class because of I've communication difficulties and autism. We're a special class, so none can tell us to wear one anyway. I've told my teachers I've problems understanding what they says because of their masks and they refuse using a clear mask 50% of the time insisting on black one. I studies with others to learn. Arguing with certain people aren't changing them. So, I live my life as much I can without starting an argument. If my country made laws, I could protest. Wasting energy on every commoners, no!</p>

        <p>The most important thing is not to initiate the conversation; rather, change the world by changing yourself and be the visual example.</p>
<p>Assuming that someone decides to engage in a discussion about the concept, then simply bring the concept to its logical conclusion. Specifically, agree that people should be respectful of others in general to create a mutual foundation. Then, ask them if someone had to suffer for the greater good, would that be justified. If they say no, then you've already reached an implicit agreement.</p>
<p>If they say yes, take it further. State something along the lines of "hypothetically speaking, if a single person had to die to ensure that everyone else could live, would it be okay to kill that person?" If they say no, then explore the concept of proportionality.</p>
<p>If they say yes, then simply ask if they'd change their mind if they were that person. If they say no, then you've reached checkmate. If they say yes, then they are truly brainwashed.</p>
