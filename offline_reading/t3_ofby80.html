        <p>You know, there has been a far fewer percentage of infections in previously infected over vaccinated people. And that's even after government health agencies urged to lower PCR test cycle thresholds for a vaccinated population. And since vaccinated people perceive themselves as being protected, far fewer of them are being tested. Furthermore, natural immunity is more robust and long term than vaccine acquired immunity. Did you and the so-called "experts" forget how vaccines work? They don't necessarily stop transmission of the virus, they merely lessen symptoms of the disease.</p>
<p>The vaccines have been a great tool, but they're not a miracle cure. They have been very helpful and saved many lives in the elderly population. However, among the young and those previously infected, they offer no benefit, and an unnecessary risk. The risk for younger people are greater with the vaccine than with COVID. Only a small percentage of children have been fully vaccinated, yet reports of serious injuries and death in this age group are already piling up. Meanwhile, COVID has been widespread for well over a year and less children have died from that disease than from the annual flu. And we still don't know the potential long term affects of the vaccines, since they were developed in under a year. </p>
<p>So your post is incredibly misleading. Many unvaccinated people have been just as protected (if not more) and experienced less illness just by virtue of being not in a vulnerable group or having natural immunity.</p>

        <p>Lol, government healthcare, where the outcome is whatever we say it is, whenever we say it is.</p>
<p>You do know the Canadian government said they will count all deaths within 28 days of a covid test as a covid death? </p>
<p><a href="https://www.saltwire.com/atlantic-canada/news/canada/ontario-death-count-includes-people-who-didnt-die-of-covid-19-but-exactly-how-many-is-unknown-507544/">https://www.saltwire.com/atlantic-canada/news/canada/ontario-death-count-includes-people-who-didnt-die-of-covid-19-but-exactly-how-many-is-unknown-507544/</a></p>
<p>\&rt;“It hasn’t been routine practice for public health units to get the death certificates or any follow-up physician and/or coroner reports that determine whether COVID-19 was the underlying or contributing cause of death,” said a spokesperson for Peel Public Health. “The Ministry has asked health units, however, to report through our provincial reporting systems: all deaths who have died with COVID-19 whether or not it was the cause of death.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the vast majority of Nova Scotia's deaths came from one old age home. When the old age home "covid" deaths were investigated in Ontario, it was determined they had died of neglect, while family members were barred from entry. We, of course, did not bother to investigate in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>That is the data you are using. Meanwhile, a doctor reports 3 serious adverse reactions from vaccine, and the government refused to investigate because: vaccines don't cause serious adverse reactions. </p>
<p>So, keep telling us your numbers that were utterly manipulated and keep wondering why we treat you like a fool.</p>
