    <strong>An attempt from the Libertarian sub to defend Newsome's policies on shutting down restaurants, even after going through preventative measures, and keeping movies open</strong>
    <p><p>I figured this would help see the extent to which the desire to be shut down has infiltrated digital discourse.  We're now seeing communities that in principle are designed to celebrate, well, being left alone are embracing dictates and state level mandates even with insanely inconsistent policies.  Social media's takeover by those who want to be controlled seems to be getting even bigger.</p>

<p>" So, there’s a bit of a difference in the way these two businesses work that she is failing to understand. Movie productions worth their salt would have tested everyone who is working. Most productions are testing individuals 3-5 times a week. They are creating a “covid-free bubble” environment to work in. This goes for the actors, producers, crew, etc. If everyone is testing negative, and the cast and crew all agree to self-quarantine during production, there is a relatively low risk.</p>
<p>Her bar’s business model is based on a social gathering place, where people congregate who AREN’T actively working. They remove masks to eat, drink, and socialize. Few people are working compared to the number of patrons they could host, most likely several people per table. There is no way to know or trace who has been tested.</p>
<p>The movie production tents have one chair per table. They are obviously practicing social distancing measures for workers who are going to catering. People have to eat at work, and this is the best/ safest way to provide a meal. I can guarantee you that it isn’t cheap. They aren’t setting up outdoor dining as a luxury, it is out of necessity and caution.</p>
<p>I work in the movie industry and I can tell you, with all the unions (SAG-AFTRA, DGA, IATSE, and Teamsters) they have devised probably one of the safest and well thought out plans for getting back to work and keeping everyone safe.</p>
<p>There is an obvious and apparent high risk of spreading the virus in social gatherings, so I can understand why her business is not open to the public at the moment."</p>

        <p>r/Libertarian has long since been compromised unfortunately and is basically just a bunch of leftists masquerading as "libertarians" while downvoting any actual libertarian content/viewpoints. I'd recommend checking out r/GoldandBlack instead, which is currently the actual libertarian sub with mods who seem to be doing a better job of protecting the integrity of their sub.</p>

        <p>Defending anything based on lack of credible evidence is just insanity to be quite honest. Living here in California and seeing so many businesses post not only that they won't be open but they've closed their doors for good, these aren't corporations, these are mom and pop places that are trying to put food on their families table... sincerely and wholeheartedly, fuck the tyrants that are imposing these nonsense lockdowns.</p>
