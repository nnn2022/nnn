    <strong>Today I Learned Pfizer developed two similar vaccines</strong>
    <p><p>The one that was released is the full sequence of the spike protein while the sister vaccine was shelved. This study suggests that the sister vaccine was less risky considering the potential for adverse effects. This may just be a theory but people in powers of positions may be receiving the unreleased safer vaccine while the public gets poisoned.</p>
<p>"The different effects of the full-length S1 and RBD only-containing proteins may be important considering that BNT162b2 and many other COVID-19 vaccines express the full-length spike protein, while the BNT162b1 vaccine encodes only the RBD region [9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]. There are some other RBD-based COVID-19 vaccines being developed as well [43]. It is possible that the RBD-based vaccines are less immunogenic, but may not affect the host cells. Thus, they may be less risky considering potential long-term adverse effects
 BNT162b2 encodes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to elicit virus-neutralizing antibodies [9,10]. More specifically, it encodes the full-length spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 with two amino acids mutated to proline in the S2 subunit to maintain the prefusion conformation, while its sister vaccine BNT162b1 (also from Pfizer/BioNTech) encodes only the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, trimerized by the addition of a T4 fibritin foldon domain [9,10,11]. Clinical trials have demonstrated that neither BNT162b1 [11] nor BNT162b12 [9,10] exhibit serious short-term adverse effects. On 10 December 2020, the results of a large clinical trial for BNT162b were published, showing that this vaccine conferred 95% protection in persons 16 years of age or older [12]. Long-term consequences of these vaccines are, however, unknown."https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7827936/#!po=81.7073
