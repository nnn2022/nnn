    <strong>Because so many people are indoctrinated nowadays, even if they are someone you’re close to you have to subtly convince them to openly look at your POV. My recommendation, watch “The Boys.”</strong>
    <p><p>Of course you could tell someone to read 1984 or Brave New World, but those are books and sadly most people don’t like reading. If you aren’t aware, the boys is a satire of the traditional “Justice League” model of superhero storytelling. Unlike something like Invincible, it takes a realistic, gritty, and heavily critical tone, turning the Justice league into a corporate hogwash, and Superman into a literal fucking degenerate. Besides it being a great show all around, it does an incredible job portraying the duality of the public persona and the true nature of celebrities. For people who think Dr. Faulk is the savior of humanity, this show really makes them think and gives perspective. </p>
<p>Ok sure, I mostly made this post to gush about the boys as I think it’s severely under watched, but I think it is very relevant to the current situation involving leader figures and tangled bureaucracy. Sadly nowadays outright telling someone the truth doesn’t do anything, so methods like these generally give people more open minds.</p>
<p>Note: There is one episode that seems pretty anti-christian, but I think it’s arguing more against the corporatization of Christianity, and not Christianity itself.</p></p>
