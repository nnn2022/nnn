    <strong>How can the level of risk truly be calculated?</strong>
    <p><p>I hear SO MANY people stating that they are "at risk" for hospitalization or death from covid to justify their support of lockdowns, masks and vaccines.</p>
<p>These people are NOT elderly, but they may have immune deficiencies, or asthma, or other issues that the "experts" say puts those people in the high risk categories. </p>
<p>But how exactly is that measured? I mean, if you are 28 years old with severe asthma, what is your actual risk of hospitalization or death? Does your risk jump from .005 to .05?</p>
<p>And what if you're 60 and obese? How much greater is your risk compared to someone who is 60 and fit?</p>
<p>It seems that millions of people think covid is an automatic death sentence for them if they have just one supposed risk factor, even if they're younger than 70.</p></p>

        <p>If your risk is 1 in 10000, doubling your risk is still only 1 in 5000 which is pretty insignificant - the reason that people don't understand these things can be laid solely at the educational system.</p>
<p>I'm approaching 60, and younger people (say under 35) look at me oddly when I can do decent arithmetical estimation in my head given some numbers - I was taught it by a very good maths teacher when I was about 15, they never were</p>

        <p>The risk could be statistically determined by comparison.</p>
<p>For example: Does Diabetes increase the chance of dying by Covid? Now, imagine for a second we got actual reliable data:</p>
<p>What % of people without Diabetes died by Covid? = X</p>
<p>What % of people with Diabetes died by Covid? = 1.2X</p>
<p>Assuming an even distribution on every other relevant factor (such as age, other diseases....), you would now see that the chance of dying by Covid increases by 20% if you have diabetes.</p>
