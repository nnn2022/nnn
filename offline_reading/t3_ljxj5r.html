    <strong>An outsider’s perspective</strong>
    <p><p>I just want to say right off the bat that I mean no disrespect with this post - I don’t agree with most of the stuff that gets posted in here, but wanted to have a nuanced discussion with you all &amp; get your takes on a few things &amp; question some of the talking points I see here a lot.</p>
<p>First of all, I get your frustration with lockdowns. I don’t think anybody thought when this all started that they would still be going on at this point. But here’s the part that really gets me mad: they’re not still going on everywhere. There are places in the world that are not locked down while basically having no Covid. New Zealand and Vietnam, specifically. Why is that? Because clearly lockdowns are not completely effective in and of themselves. Those countries also had widespread testing regimens, enforced quarantines, and thorough contact tracing set up right at the beginning, in addition to stricter but shorter lockdowns . All these things combined effectively eliminated the virus. If you’re a westerner like me and you feel like getting mad at the government (like I am), you should ask why the f your country didn’t do the same thing. This to me is the main thing we should all be focused on re. COVID.</p>
<p>All that said, I want to discuss a few arguments I’ve been seeing over &amp; over in here. I hope I’ve made it clear so far that I don’t like living this reality anymore than you do. But what exactly would the alternative look like? The consensus here seems to be that we should have no lockdowns/mask orders whatsoever &amp; try to get to herd immunity. For this hypothetical I’m just talking about the US. My best assumption based on all the data I’ve seen is that deaths have probably been slightly overcounted, but that cases have been severely undercounted. Let’s say that actually only 400,000 have died who wouldn’t have without getting COVID, but that there have actually been 60 million us cases. That would mean that the virus is actually less deadly than currently thought, but that we’d be looking at around 2 million deaths before herd immunity. Is that cool with you? I’d say that that’s pretty unacceptable. For reference, total deaths last year from all causes were 3 million. </p>
<p>This post is getting rather long so I’ll save other points for next time. Just one more quick unrelated thing, maybe my #1 pet peeve with this sub: the whole “masks are never coming off” thing. You do realize that the next landmark development in authoritarian surveillance is/will be facial recognition, right? Why would our elites want to give up that power by making masks a permanent thing?</p>
<p>Thanks for reading this far, hopefully we can have a reasonable discussion.</p></p>

        <p>&rt;New Zealand and Vietnam, specifically. Why is that?</p>
<p>It always bothers me when people try and directly compare the US to other countries, specifically countries with quite little in common with them. Particularly New Zealand, the most egregious one. Every country, state, and region is different. There's no cure-all to this virus. If there was, we all wouldn't still be dealing with this. There are tons of places around the world and in the US that have always had strict mask mandates and pretty much always stayed in lockdown, that are currently getting shafted by the virus.</p>
<p>&rt;If you’re a westerner like me and you feel like getting mad at the government</p>
<p>We're mad at them for different reasons though. I'm mad at them because instead of letting people have the liberty of staying inside if they were so terrified and paranoid of this virus, they shoved mask mandates, numberous personal and business-related restrictions, and lockdowns down our throats - shattering the economy in the process, and resulting in massive harm towards essentially everyone. The "cure" is worse than the virus itself at this point.</p>
<p>&rt;The consensus here seems to be that we should have no lockdowns/mask orders whatsoever &amp; try to get to herd immunity.</p>
<p>I just think that people should take personal responsibility for themselves, and not rely on others (and/or government) to do it for them. Protect the vulnerable, and take any and all personal precautions necessary to feel safe. Let others live also their lives as they see fit. Win-win.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the reply. First, as far as every country being different/no cure-all. Reread my post. There basically is a cure-all: diligent contact tracing, enforced quarantines, mass testing, strict but shorter lockdowns. The proof of this is the fact that two very different countries in terms of culture, population density, and economy were able to get things under control with minimal loss of life &amp; freedom.</p>
<p>We have no idea if the cure is worse than the disease at this point. Preliminary data suggests that cancer rates, overdoses, suicides, etc. are not meaningfully impacted by lockdown in comparison to the death toll of the virus. I can link sources if you’re truly curious. As far as economic impact goes, opening everything and going for herd immunity would definitely have a severe economic impact as well.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the “personal responsibility “ part. If the government isn’t paying people to stay home, then people who wouldn’t otherwise choose to will be forced to work. How is that not taking freedom of choice away from them?</p>

        <p>&rt;There basically is a cure-all</p>
<p>Then you should tell everyone else. Why hasn't every country followed those exact, specific guidelines you listed then. What works in x country most likely won't work the same way in y country. Especially when you throw the US into the mix, a country that currently and historically places a high value on personal liberties, freedoms, and rights. Plus, our massive size, population, GDP, and distinct and diverse landscapes and living conditions further complicate everything.</p>
<p>And all that doesn't even touch upon all the repercussions from implementing the measures that would be necessary to maybe possibly sorta even slow this virus, let alone stop it. Reality is, no one has a solid handle on this virus, and there's no easy fix that will cause minimal damage, and we're a year in. Different methods have been tried, but there hasn't been a clear-cut solution. Open up again and let people live their lives as they personally see fit.</p>
<p>Your cure-all is essentially what's already been done all over the world: "Alright, lock it all down and screw everyone that will be harmed and/or killed as a result of them, all so we can possibly maybe sorta slow the spread of this virus with a stupidly high survival rate all because people can't stay home on their own if they're so afraid of it."</p>
<p>&rt;minimal loss of life &amp; freedom</p>
<p>Only the NZ government and citizens are totally all about giving the middle finger to freedom any time they can, and Vietnam's governmental track record is far from ideal. Either way, neither of these places are even halfway similar to the US.</p>
<p>The reverse of what you say is true as well. Plenty of countries and states have tried similar things to what your propose, to absolutely no avail. Again, Europe and California. No one has a solid grip on this thing. If there was a cure-all, we wouldn't be talking about the virus right now.</p>
<p>&rt;We have no idea if the cure is worse than the disease at this point.</p>
<p>Tanked economies, and massive spikes in unemployment, home loss, poverty, starvation, obesity, missed health checks, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, depression, anxiety, loss of basic personal freedoms, suicide. Things that definitively 100% harm countless people alllll over the world - all to implement measures that may possibly sorta slow the spread of a relatively quite weak virus. Measures that have been implemented for the last year and haven't worked all too well as of yet. Bet hey, maybe they will next week, or the week after. Protect the vulnerable, stay home if you're scared, take personal precautions.</p>
<p>&rt;If the government isn’t paying people to stay home, then people who wouldn’t otherwise choose to will be forced to work.</p>
<p>Tell that to all the governments that don't pay people massive amounts to sit at home all day like how the US does.</p>
<p>&rt;How is that not taking freedom of choice away from them?</p>
<p>There's no perfect solution where everyone will be happy. But I'm okay with forcing some people who don't to work in a situation that they may personally (and subjectively) feel uncomfortable in, with numerous precautions in place to protect them, with countless personal precautions that they can take on top of that, and for a virus that if they happen to catch, there's a stupidly high chance they'll not be harmed. I'd much rather that, than forcefully take countless entire livlihoods away, keeping people away from work when they want to do so, and plunging people deep into the categories I listed earlier.</p>
<p>I say this particularly, since I'm young and healthy, and have a wayyyy higher chance of being harmed/killed by the "cure" than I do by the virus. And then you factor in the shit ton of people who are very willing and able to work, but are choosing not to because they're hugely incentivized to sit and home and get paid massive amounts by the government.</p>

        <p>I think you’re missing the point a bit here, either intentionally or not. Again, it’s been shown that there is a way to basically get rid of the virus while avoiding the worst of lockdown. It has been done in two very different countries. We (USA) could theoretically have done it too if the political will had been there: invoke the War Powers act and start manufacturing enough n95 masks for every citizen, hire an army’s worth of contact tracers, bring in the national guard to enforce quarantines, and lock down for a few months while paying people and small businesses way more than a paltry $1,200 and a pittance in unemployment that has since expired. We could have been back to normal at the beginning of last summer. But we didn’t do any of that, and it’s too late now to try it. That’s what pisses me off. And that’s what should piss all of you off. </p>
<p>Instead, we’re stuck dealing with a choice between two shitty realities: perpetual semi-lockdown (ftr pretty much everything is open in my state at reduced capacity) that damages the economy by saving some x amount of lives, or completely opening up which will cost a far greater amount of lives (we can’t say how many, but it will be more) while relieving economic damage maybe, we can’t say for sure that that will be the case either.</p>
<p>Point being ultimately that, like you say, there are no black and white solutions at this point. But this sub as a whole seems to think that there are, and for all the talk about doomers and sheeple, it doesn’t seem that interested in examining its own beliefs and really considering the repercussions of the solutions it proposes.</p>
<p>Oh and lastly, you should rethink/reread that second to last paragraph you wrote in the context of the rest of your post, it’s pretty hypocritical.</p>

        <p>Yes, that many deaths is cool with me. The largest generation in the history of humanity is getting up there in age. There was going to be an uptick in deaths year over year anyway. Our social security and Medicare are in the toilet, maybe this will fix it? Nothing that has been done has had a positive effect on the death toll yet the economy has divebombed and our children are not getting proper educations. Moreover, those schoolchildren are being given no hope and many are killing themselves. We should have let this shit run it’s course and protected the vulnerable, not punish the whole populous.</p>

        <p>I appreciate your honesty but uh... you know that’s a pretty dark way to look at things, right? And you know that if we truly had the will to we could just fund entitlement programs more rather than sacrificing millions of lives.</p>
<p>Also, everybody goes on and on here about the economic toll of lockdown. It’s obviously real, but do you really think the economic cost of trying to hit herd immunity wouldn’t be equally as disastrous? For one thing, we’d probably be seeing major supply chain disruptions as entire factories/warehouses have to go off line due to outbreaks, which means things like food shortages, maybe not to a degree where society collapses but still best avoided to say the least.</p>

<p>Protecting people according to their clinical risk. Basic pre-March 2020 epidemiology.</p>
<p>&rt;First of all, I get your frustration with lockdowns</p>
<p>Frustration? Try seething hatred. They throw the lives of the poor and vulnerable away so young, rich Westerners (at next-to-no clinical risk) can pretend they're doing some good while doing nothing at all, as endless gig economy workers run around spreading their germs for them. The only reason they were ever justified - to 'protect the NHS' - isn't a natural reason; it's because oligarchs and bandit ministers were allowed to loot it, robbing us of the resources it needed to weather a crisis that <em>everyone</em> saw coming. There was a reason that all the science up until March 2020 thought lockdowns have no epidemiological benefits, and unanimously affirmed they are a tool of despots and tyrants.</p>
<p>&rt;I don’t think anybody thought when this all started that they would still be going on at this point</p>
<p>They should have listened to the science, then.</p>
<p>&rt;All these things combined effectively eliminated the virus. If you’re a westerner like me and you feel like getting mad at the government (like I am), you should ask why the f your country didn’t do the same thing</p>
<p>They didn't do the same thing because it's stupid. You can't eliminate a mutating virus that has animal reservoirs. Even relatively stable ones (like coronaviruses). Countries that aim for 'zero Covid' will be stuck in an endless loop of lockdowns when they get <em>one</em> case.</p>

        <p>First of all, source regarding the scientific consensus being generally opposed to lockdowns before Covid? Never heard that before. Can’t remember a similar pandemic situation within my lifetime - I guess the only two are Ebola and swine flu. In those cases, a lockdown wouldn’t be as effective because a) they both kill quicker and at a higher rate and thus are less transmissible, and b) the onset of symptoms comes quicker than it does with Covid, also making them less transmissible.</p>
<p>Your second paragraph is kind of incoherent, maybe because I’m an American and you’re in the uk, but I think I agree overall with what you’re trying to get at. </p>
<p>And as far as completely eliminating the virus: I think we would have had a good chance at doing it early in the pandemic if basically the whole world would have handled it properly. I understand that the odds of that having happened are pretty slim.</p>

        <p>I wanted to hear you out, but you kinda lost me when you brought up New Zealand. They are in no way back to normal - in fact, they literally just went back into lockdown yesterday. Meanwhile, in several U.S. states, everything is open at full capacity and has been for some time, and they don't have to worry about future lockdowns because they've decided to accept the risk and move on.</p>
<p>However, I do agree about the masks; I doubt anyone wants to make masks permanent, and that peer pressure is the only thing keeping people complacent with them. Once that's gone (probably this summer in the U.S.), masks will follow.</p>

        <p>I commend you for trying to start a rational discussion.  On Reddit of all places!  I disagree with you on most points but I have to agree with you in the mask thing.  I don’t like wearing a mask because of the stupid virus, but I do like the anonymity it provides.  I just want it to be MY choice instead of the government’s.  We are already seeing in more than one state pushback from governors who were granted overreaching “emergency powers” and now are not willing to give those powers back when asked by their legislatures.</p>

        <p>I’m glad you’re opening the discussion- we need more of this. So as others have pointed out, it’s a wet dream that countries that implement more authoritarian measures will be able to have no cases. They just keep going back into lockdowns when the cases rise because guess what? That’s not how pandemics end. There has not been a single pandemic that has ended through anything other than enough people getting sick and recovering to establish herd immunity. The idea that if enough people sit in their house the virus will float away is complete fantasy and I’m shocked that anyone thinks this way. </p>
<p>As far as masks go, I’m less concerned about video surveillance than the slide to authoritarian measures through gradual rules. I would imagine at some point that there would be a push to replace your masks with an ‘effective and safe’ vaccine (which we won’t really know until 2023 when the clinical trials end). For now the vaccine is emergency authorized only, not FDA approved because it is experimental by nature. And even the manufacturer noted that they have no clue if it prevents transmission and it’s not even meant to prevent infection, just symptoms. So it’s well, quite pointless in terms of hoping to limit spread or establish herd immunity. So really I see the possibility of this being dragged out while curtailing the lives of people who want their freedoms. </p>
<p>And as far as worrying about people dying, that’s a fact of life. I’ve spent weeks bedridden w chronic health issues. People get sick. It happens. Now is that worth the cost on a societal level? Or should we all be able to decide what measures we take as individuals? This cost has been heavily burdened by young people who are not at risk- look at the rates of suicide. I’m also afraid for kids who are growing up now, especially very young kids who need to see peoples faces to learn to judge social cues, interact with others, go in public to bolster their immune systems. If anyone thinks they’re gonna stay healthy by not interacting with others, not getting sunlight, and dowsing themselves in hand sanitizer they’re wrong. Isolation and over sanitization are some of the worst things you can do for your immune system. </p>
<p>Also on the mass surveillance point, sure you can monitor peoples faces, but what do you think the excuse for implementation is? Samsung is unrolling mass surveillance in Australia for- you guessed it- tracking adherence to social distancing and mask wearing. So by opposing mandated mask wearing you are actively opposing these measures. Wish you well and open to discussing further</p>

        <p>Thank you for your thought-out response. There’s a lot I could dig into here but it might have to wait until tomorrow. Quick question though: you’re a libertarian, right?</p>
