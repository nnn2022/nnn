    <strong>Phase 2 of the effort to destroy small businesses has begun</strong>
    <p><p>First, the government makes conditions for small businesses so difficult that many are forced to close.  Those that were able to remain open were still financially devastated.</p>
<p>So the government swoops in with a program to "give" these small businesses money.  They were aggressively encouraged to take out these PPP loans.  Their objections and reservations were all met with "don't worry, your loan will be forgiven".</p>
<p>But instead of just giving the small business owners the money directly, Congress funnels the money through their cronies and masters at the "too big to fail" banks.</p>
<p>So small businesses take out thousands of dollars in loans from these banks with assurances from the government, and the banks themselves, that they'll never have to repay the money.</p>
<p>Flash forward to today.  Banks are now telling these small businesses owners that they (the banks) gave them too much money and that they will have to pay part of the money back, with interest.</p>
<p>Banks are now aggressively targeting and persecuting small business owners already financially devastated by the lockdowns.  The banks are saying that the small businesses owners were approved for too much money (by the banks themselves) so now they are no longer eligible for the loan forgiveness that both the banks and the government assured them that they would receive.</p>
