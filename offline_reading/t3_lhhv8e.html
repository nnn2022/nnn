    <strong>Today me and my co-workers made a man see the truth</strong>
    <p><p>I work as a mechanic and have never bought into the mask scam, like isn't it more than obvious?! When all this kicked off last year, a few of my co workers turned up with masks and me and a couple other dudes shut them down instantly and they have never worn a mask since then. Fast forward to this year, we have had a number of customers turn up, challenge our no mask policy, only for them to turn their car around and leave. And for what? All because they believe the false information the media and dr faucet himself are feeding them. Unbelievable how stupid some people can be. 
But today was different. A guy in his 40s turns up (still wearing the infamous light blue CO2 collector), and as soon as he sees the employees wearing no slave apparatus and the no mask sign, he says to me "You know what, I am exhausted of playing along just to please the higher ups and my wife (his OH sounded like a real sheep). I'm glad that good, honest and smart people like you and your employees still exist" and he took his mask off. I swear I'm not making this shit up, you could legit see his face fill with life and joy as soon as he took a breath of fresh, clean air. 
I just wish more people reacted this way, it honestly felt like a beautiful moment! The guy only came in for an oil change and a new timing belt, but also got reaffirmed and cleared his mind about this whole ebola scam!</p></p>

        <p>Sir, if you are ever in the Tri-State area (NY, NJ, CT), I will buy you and your co-workers a beer and shake your hand!</p>
<p>Thank you for using your critical thinking skills rather then listening blindly to Fraudulent Prophet Fauci (Piss, and Shit be Upon Him).</p>
<p>Not to hijack your submission, yesterday, went to hit to hit the head, and this guy was in their, too, no mask on, I just said to him, "hey, man, it is good to see a face!" And he lit up, and said likewise.</p>
