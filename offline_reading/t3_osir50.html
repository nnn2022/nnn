    <strong>Dumb people want a dumb pandemic to end because a dumb government imposes dumb restrictions on living. Today its an injection, tomorrow its whatever they decide.</strong>
    <p><p>Smart people want an end to government mandates. That instantly works. Some people will get it, some will die, just like influenza has done every single year in history. </p>
<p>The ones pulling the strings want you to fear, so you give up rights willingly. And once they have the right to shut out anyone from a public building, then we are extra fucked. </p>
<p>Because for now its vaccine status, but very soon after it will be taxation status, health history, mental illness status, political affliation, and eventually your social credit scores. Those will be used to make you conform to whatever they want. </p>
<p>Today they want you to inject a pharmaceutical therapy, but there's no limit on what they can demand tomorrow.</p></p>

        <p>Indeed. Tomorrow they will decide they won't let you buy or sell without the Mark of the Beast. We are witnessing a 2000 year old biblical prophecy come to life. </p>
<p>The vaccine passport you already see in France, Cyprus, Israel etc. is setting up the system for it. </p>
<p>Revelations 13
16¬†And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:
17¬†And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
18¬†Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.</p>

<p>It's going to end with God winning, don't take the mark.  Read the Bibles book of Revelations and the Gospel of Christ.</p>

        <p>They are already banning the sale of some Alienware gamer PCs in states like Colorado and California cause they said it takes too much electrical energy. I got the notice on Dell.com, Best buy and Alienware website</p>

        <p>And they are also banning people that have gotten counseling or anti depressant medication from getting life insurance. They spend billions of dollars pushing anti depressants,  then ban you from life insurance and being able to look after your family</p>
