    <strong>Why are they still pushing a vaxx that does NOT work????!!!</strong>
    <p><p>Today one of my Facebook friends posted this, I have rephrased it...</p>
<p>""The delta variant is spreading like wildfire. One of my vaxxed friends has tested positive. It's supposed to present itself just like a cold or allergies!" [my note---PROBABLY BECAUSE THAT'S ALL IT IS or the person is going down ADE road]</p>
<p>"Two or more of my vaxxed friends have gotten sick too and have gotten it." {my note--the vaxxed with their destroyed immune systems are probably getting deathly sick with colds}</p>
<p>"No one around here is wearing masks and I am pissed. I was contacted because I may have been exposed from a delivery driver! I am scared as a vaxxed person, but for you unvaxxed people your risks are extremely high!!!!!!!!""</p>
<hr>
<p>So if the shit doesn't work, why are they still pushing it?</p>
<p>Here there's lots of lies too, how much of Delta is a simple cold, or ADE kicking in where they will pick up every virus, etc etc....</p>
<p>Be careful they are blaming the unvaxxed for Delta. I haven't been around any of the vaxxed to blame me. </p>
<p>None of this makes any damn sense.</p></p>

        <p>Running that clock to the Fall, and towards 2030..</p>
<p>Each variant announced is meant to 'reset the clock' of fear and allow them to rehash the same idea, dismiss all previous data and statistics, and further confuse and fearmonger the public into submission.</p>
<p>They are destroying all your notions of freedom and what is real, so they can "Build Back Better" into their image of the world they figure you should live in.</p>
<p>There is logic behind it, it's just that people want to ignore it, as the ramifications are so monstrous it would scare the living poop out of them.</p>

        <p>They are using every abuser's tool in the tool box, double binds, bribes, candy and flowers before the beatings/Lottos for vaxx and days of extreme illness that are acceptable--the short term flu.  I don't know why the vaxxed aren't waking the hell up and realizing they were "had", as the new variants come. Agenda 21 is real.</p>

        <p>I think this guy on Twitter is correct, the spike protein in various guises and deliveries is the bullet in the gun so to speak of the Covid vaxx. I believe they will be sickened and many will die. I am already on enough medication, they don't need to make more money from me.</p>

        <p>COVID VACCINES ARE FAILING TO PREVENT TRANSMISSION, MEANING THE IMMUNOCOMPROMISES WILL GET WEEDED OUT EITHER WAY, especially being that the vaccine doesnt protect them as well,</p>

<p>Not to mention how Israel is saying the 64% efficacy for the Mrna vaccine quoted 2 weeks ago seems FAR to high in regards to the delta variant, 🤔mhhhm i wonder whats making them say this?? Obviously they are seeing people that are vaccinated catch it at record high numbers </p>
<p>https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/health-ministry-fears-vaccine-s-effectiveness-against-delta-is-even-below-64-1.10011484</p>
<p>Also Gibraltar who is estimated to be over 90% Vaccinated are having multiple Vaccinated people catch covid, so where is herd immunity?</p>

        <p>They designed all this to kill as many as people as possible. Think about it a non-vaxxed person used to be protected by other vaccines, that's why these vaxxes are useless. I hope I am immune [could be don't know] otherwise my luck is going to run out at a certain point. I plan to get some Ivermectin soon. [budgeting the at least 200 I know it will take to get human kind]</p>
<p>Israel is mostly highly vaccinated country, how's it working for them? Not very well. </p>
