        <p>Yeah, hallways might not be the best example anymore. My worst experience in all this happened when a lunatic grabbed me and kept pushing me off the elevator to try to keep me in  the hallway of my own condo because I wasn't wearing a mask (and that was before mask mandates!). Now masks are mandatory to even leave our units even if we just need to use the garbage chute in the hallway, and there are signs posted everywhere instructing people to call the police on anyone not wearing a mask.</p>
<p>Maybe the expression can be "like a walk around your own living room". At least until police are allowed warrantless entry here too like they are in my neighboring province.</p>

        <p>That's the dumbest part of closing bars for me. Even when open, last call for bars is at 10:00 where I live like people aren't gonna just move from the bar to someone's house to keep the party going, pretty much always to a house that is much smaller than a bar and no rules to follow with masks and distancing.</p>

        <p>That never made sense to me either. So instead of allowing people to gather in restaurants and bars with restrictions, they closed them up and forced people to gather at home without any restrictions......</p>

        <p>They specifically went there because it was less crowded near their homes. The police claim they should have gone nearer their homes as it was â€˜saferâ€™. If the point is to avoid people then they are doing that.</p>

        <p>Lol. There have been a ton of these 'police are everywhere' stories. I wouldn't be surprised if it's a coordinated campaign. There's literally no police anywhere. The people caught account for 0.00001 percent of the country. And as long as you have a good excuse fines go nowhere. Did you know you don't even have to quarantine if you tick the mental health box? And most of the 'scare stories' are people who already have full on obvious profiles that they're rebels. This means they get reported more and police jump to fine them. The truth is if you keep a low profile no one cares what you do. The media loves to highlight this dumb stuff to scare you into submission. Another thing to do is to accept psychologically that you may be fined. Then you won't care what happens. The fines are unenforceable anyway. Honestly? If they fine me I don't care AT ALL. I have the series of excuses ready and I look pretty innocent. These people often go to the media for attention too. All so dumb.</p>

        <p>Islands are good. There's less likelihood of huge infection. People more relaxed. There's the sea too, even if winter. I have a home on a Med island so have a head start. People can be annoying there, but if I HAVE to live like this, would rather do it there. It's about limiting the stress rather than finding somewhere with no restrictions. For example another option (if I didn't have the island property) is the Middle East. It is tax free. So I may as well live in a tax-free place, by the sea, even if it can be backward and have some restrictions. My point is I don't want to stay in a high-tax country full of restrictions with shit weather. Other options would be Miami, Sweden. Neither place will introduce full-on restrictions now. The only way is forward.</p>

        <p>I've been thinking the same thing. I can't live in this country if it's going to stay like this forever, which I know they will try to impose and it's worrying seeing how many sheep still believe this is about 'safety.' But I've not been sure where to move. I also don't really want to move, as I like this country, but it has changed beyond recognition with these psychopaths in power.</p>

        <p>So my thinking is that they are not doing this deliberately. You can tell Boris hates doing it. It's SAGE that's pushing him. But it doesn't matter if the outcome is the same. The thing is, they keep dangling the carrot (we will let you free) so we are compliant. This is not because they're sinister it's because they don't know. They have no idea. But as I said, it doesn't matter the psychological effects are the same. I've therefore set a deadline of April. No matter what if kids aren't back at school, if we can't mix indoors etc I will leave. I doubt all restrictions will be lifted but if we're not back on track I'm leaving. Set yourself a hard deadline. It will make you feel good</p>

        <p>Oh I disagree, I think Boris is a psychopath. He's a known liar, and his dad wrote a book called 'The Virus' about how a virus is used to reduce the population. Boris has also been quoted in the past talking about how overpopulation is a massive issue and something needs to be done about it. He hates us and wants us dead, as do Sage, they're all evil psychopathic bastards in my opinion, being paid millions by their billionaire minders. It's good that you're got an escape plan. I don't know what to do yet but I'm getting myself organised.

He'd happily let people die of CV if he felt that it was popular. He's just an empty vessel SAGE are the ones with an agenda.

        <p>he's definitely manipulative. But remember he nearly died of covid. It could have changed him. Plus he looks so upset all the time on PMQs. Like so downbeat. Also, many many people who have known him for years in the media say he is this way inclined. They call him selfish and say he should lockdown harder! Rumour has it SAGE bully him and i believe it. Now Matt Hancock and some of the SAGE monsters are enjoying this. Boris I don't believe he is. He is very dangerous as he is a very weak character. I don't give too many deets as it could be outing, but i have worked in politics in the past and know a lot of people who are relatively close to him. I've never once heard them mention this personality trait.</p>

        <p>Fair enough. Whether he a psychopath or just utterly weak, bullied and paid off, in the end he is a nightmare for this country and needs to be held accountable. I don't believe he nearly died of Covid, I think that, like most other things in the media, was staged in order to further the narrative they are pushing. Also, remember that psychopaths and narcissists are incredibly charming, so a lot of people who know him will probably think he's great, I mean, he's always been hugely popular despite being a lying philanderer. Also remember that he hates so called anti vaxxers and would probably like to make this vaccine mandatory. A dangerous man. Just to clarify, it's not me down voting you, it looks like someone is down voting us both for some reason!</p>

        <p>Interesting. Well I will keep an eye-out for these traits. I do believe he's a narcissist, no doubt.  His kids hate him for being such a cheater, he's basically obsessed with sex and women...he's not really dangerous in so far as 'coming up with the plan' but he will do stuff to gain favour and power so yes, he's dangerous.</p>

        <p>Youâ€™re right - did you see the story a couple weeks back about the man arrested for driving out of tier 4 in breach of regulations? Turns out he was pulled over for having no tax or insurance on his car. Absolute joke journalism. How people canâ€™t identify these articles as blatant propaganda is beyond me.</p>

        <p>Yes exactly. This is exactly what I mean. And the people with no masks who are arrested are almost always starting arguments. And if you go to a protest you will inevitably encounter issues. Not saying this is good, just putting it into perspective. This makes people think there are police everywhere, we are living in a police state. It's not even remotely like that and people should do as they wish, within reason.</p>

        <p>Yup - itâ€™s like that other poster saying that people in Eastern Europe lived normal lives under the Soviets, they just didnâ€™t talk about it. Iâ€™m recognising this every day - friends, colleagues, family all nonchalantly expressing that theyâ€™ve broken the rules, tongue in cheek saying that they shouldnâ€™t be doing things, but doing them anyway.

        <p>So Sadiq Khan has said London is an emergency. I checked my area and it's roughly 600 out of 1000. Total deaths since the start in the whole of my area (not just my ward, my constituency) is 169 since the start. This is not a high figure. I knonw it's devastating forthe NHS because it's bogged down, but it's really not at all devastating for us.</p>

        <p>Itâ€™s also not our responsibility if the NHS is bogged down - years of cuts have led to this culmination of pressure. It doesnâ€™t help that quarantining rules are ridiculous &amp; lateral flow tests are being overlooked when they could be deployed to massively improve our understaffing issue overnight.</p>

        <p>Yeah. So they've shifted responsibility for the pandemic onto the masses rather than investing in resources which sucks. It's not my/our fault and I won't be shamed. Out of the WHOLE constituency, just 169 deaths. Ok, I get hospitalisations are going up. So yes, there will be maybe a couple of hundred in hospital being treated too which sucks. Apparently 77 admitted in last seven days. Now that is quite a lot. And I'm sure many of them are younger 50s or so). But almost all people I've seen who have been hospitalised have been obese. I'm not saying it's their fault, but if we all have to lockdown for everyone, can't we start a health campaign to get everyone healthy to avoid this? If we are in a collective system, we ALL need to take responsibility (not that I agree with this, but the NHS is based on this ideal). However, NO ONE will admit the elephant in the room: many people in the UK are very unhealthy and obese.</p>

        <p>Age is the single biggest risk factor in covid mortality. Itâ€™s so large it almost makes obesity look like nothing in comparison. Almost anyone at risk of dying from covid is old. Very old.</p>
<p>Also - admitted to or in hospital with a positive PCR test is 1) not necessarily a covid hospitalisation and 2) not necessarily even an active infection. This is a completely test driven epidemic</p>

        <p>yes. But the argument is there are many more hospitalisations in younger people. Now, hospitalisations could mean anything, including just someone being tested for corona in hospital. I think the whole thing is so overblown. Why is it a top 'emergency'...if this is what they call an emergency, the next one will come along soon. It's so absurd.</p>

        <p>I did hear a snippet of a bbc radio show where an NHS shill claimed they had more young people in hospital than normal.

        <p>What's the mood, the atmosphere like inside police forces at the moment.. Are they okay with their situation of being used for covid rule enforcement?</p>
<p>How many are resigning, etc?</p>
<p>Would be interesting to know. I don't know any cops, or know anyone who knows one.</p>

<p>In Canada sure you wear a mask inside but outside you don't have to. Outside is normal. Hell, there is more activity outdoors because everything is closed.</p>

        <p>Derbyshire Police have already walked it back this evening and tacitly admitted that they were wrong, that there is no legal restriction on the distance you are allowed to travel for exercise and that they will no longer be fining people for exercising outside of their 'local' area. </p>

<p>Still no apology from them for fining these girls though...</p>

        <p>Theoretically yes but legislation in the UK is always very open to interpretation and will say something like â€˜such that a reasonable person would interpretâ€™. </p>
<p>The â€˜reasonableâ€™ person would be up to the court to decide and said court will be a magistrates court made up of the sort of people who always convict. Magistrates courts would convict a ham sandwich if the police charged it with a crime. </p>
<p>Because the UKâ€™s stupid tendency to not specify its laws clearly and instead keep that reasonable person text in each law it means different areas have different policies under the exact same law. Derbyshire police are insane and go after anybody for anything but police in my area barely even stop you ig you are out with friends let alone just walking alone in a beauty spot.</p>

        <p>Lol, I myself was arrested for being outside my house. I didn't even resist. I'm not joking. The police said I was breaking the stay at home orders and that it was because of people like me that there was still a pandemic. I was wearing a mask and inside a car btw... just a few inches outside of my house. Not even moving the car.</p>
<p>I can't believe how easy it is to brainwash people. This has blown away everything I think I knew about humanity. If we let ourselves be treated liked this, I have no doubt we haven't evolved at all. The same witch trials all over again. </p>
<p>As I was typing this post, an ad on spotify came on about requesting a delivery for a zoom party. Shit's crazy.</p>
