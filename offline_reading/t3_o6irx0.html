        <p>This again...</p>
<p><strong>COVID vaccines are <em>not</em> the mark of the beast.</strong> They could be used as a test run for the mark, if the mark is indeed physical (<a href="http://www.usa-the-republic.com/mark%20of%20beast/Chap4.htm">which it won’t be, in all likelihood</a>). But the fact is that the vaccine is a mark on the <em>shoulder</em>, not the hand or forehead. More likely, the mark will be figurative, meaning a person would simply have to profess allegiance to the antichrist in order to buy or sell.</p>
<p>It’s not particularly healthy, from a spiritual standpoint, to spend one’s time speculating on whether or not we’re in the end times. We’ve been wrong many times before, and chances are, we’ll be wrong many times more before we actually get there. It’s much healthier to focus on deepening your relationship with God, attending Divine Liturgy, developing the fruits of the Spirit, and praying. That way, it won’t matter if it’s the end times or not—you will be doing what pleases God.</p>

        <p>The bible has said that the generation which will see the independence of Israel which was in 1948 will not die out after the return of Christ. So yeah we're in the endgame now. I'm too lazy for sources and such so just search (the bible about 1948) on youtube.</p>

        <p>If I remember correctly, the priests/Levites would mark or attach the name of the Lord or various scriptures on their hands and forehead.</p>
<p>““You shall therefore lay up these words of mine in your heart and in your soul, and you shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. You shall teach them to your children, talking of them when you are sitting in your house, and when you are walking by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise. You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates, that your days and the days of your children may be multiplied in the land that the Lord swore to your fathers to give them, as long as the heavens are above the earth.”
‭‭Deuteronomy‬ ‭11:18-21‬ ‭</p>
<p>The mark of the beast is therefore a perversion of this. It is the number of (a) man, 666. And later, if I’m correct, God alludes to an intrinsic redemption of the heart of His people:</p>
<p>“For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the Lord: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people. And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the Lord. For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.””
‭‭Jeremiah‬ ‭31:33-34‬ ‭</p>
<p>Now, scriptures have multiple layers. The passage in revelation you allude to may very well be hinting at a literal and specific mark on the right hand and or forehead, but at the very least, I see an implication where even submitting to a quasi- or precursor Mark of the Beast could be just as bad or at least comes with severe spiritual consequences, for instead of Trusting the the Lord for provision and security, one would be sacrificing one’s personal sovereignty/inalienable rights to Man, rather than submitting those rights and one’s sovereignty to God.</p>
<p>But take what I’m saying with a grain of salt, and do your own research. God only knows the Truth and ultimately put your trust in Him who knows the future.</p>

        <p>That’s a good point, too, but as I said before, it’s best not to dwell on whether or not this is the apocalypse. It doesn’t produce any spiritual fruit, and that time a person spends worrying himself over whether or not the vaccine (if it can even be called that) is the mark of the beast could be better spent in fasting, prayer, or worship.</p>
<p>Submitting to a precursor to the mark of the beast without knowing it is the precursor to the mark would not have dire spiritual consequences; as of now, we do not know with any degree of certainty that the vaccine is a precursor to the mark, nor would we, in all likelihood, until the antichrist came. God does not condemn people for committing actions that they genuinely do not realize are sins. </p>
<p>That said, there <em>is</em> a good Christian argument against the vaccine—it was developed using the fetal cell line HEK 293. The development of this cell line, in turn, <a href="https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/babies-were-aborted-alive-placed-in-fridge-to-harvest-cell-lines-used-in-some-vaccines-researcher">involved the abortion and subsequent murder of untold hundreds of babies by vivisection, without any anesthesia, in order to cut out their kidneys</a>. Since it is not moral to choose to directly benefit from someone’s murder, it is not right on those grounds alone to get the vaccine (though there are many, many other reasons as well).</p>
