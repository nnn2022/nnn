        <p>Go back in time in your imagination to January or even February. Imagine Trump had come out then and said, this coronavirus thing is actually no joke folks, I’m going to lock down the borders and force quarantines and tests on people entering the country, I’m going to lockdown the entire country for two weeks, I’m going to mandate masks. </p>
<p>People who say they wanted that stuff earlier in terms of our response would have LOST IT. Because everything Trump says is automatically wrong. They would have said, he’s being overly dramatic about this and trying to become a megalomaniac dictator, they would say he’s drunk with power and we’re not ever getting out of lockdown threat mode, they would have said this infringes on our rights, they would have then blamed him for the economy being in shambles as it now currently is, they would have agreed with Fauci’s initial stance on masks and still paraded him around because he went against Trump. It has never been about science, it’s been about being against whatever Trump says. People would have still died because it’s inevitable and they would have said this is all the fault of Trump’s lockdown power grab. Numbers would all have been the same, just arriving at a different time.</p>
<p>I’m not a Trump supporter and I would have lost it, guaranteed. These people are honestly suggesting they would have followed and agreed with ANY kind of early plan Trump rolled out, especially a heavily life changing, right infringing one? I’m calling bullshit.</p>

        <p>I know this is just some random asshole on twitter. </p>
<p>But, if this shows anything, it's that this COVID thing has become so political it makes the virus itself obsolete at this point. </p>
<p>This guy hopes that Trump gets ill just so his own political agenda comes to fruition. This is the same thing as all the folks on the COVID subs wanting any piece of news/research that goes against the narrative taken down because "anti maskers will use it against them."</p>

        <p>They probably rapid test Trump daily. Think about it, would they hastily release this news without first seeing if Trump had symptoms, or would they wait until they were pretty sure he’d be fine and release it to parade around his asymptomatic case? They’ve probably known he’s positive for a little while now. This is a huge political maneuver, they’re not just going to run to the presses the second he’s positive.</p>

        <p>Holy shit. My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken nuggets and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the Covid results tonight. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is he coughing? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so infected. I want a future to believe in. I want Biden to be president and fix this broken country. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought he was breathing well in New York???? This is so fucked.</p>

        <p>Hydroxychloroquine, zinc and Zithromax. Taking hydroxychloroquine (no greater than 200mg dose) allows the zinc to target the virus better, and the Zithromax prevents it from resurfacing. Hydroxychloroquine won’t do shit on it’s own from what I’ve read. This must all be done in early stages though</p>

<p>He tried to cut off travel weeks before this was ever a big thing here and they cried racist. Now they’re mad that he didn’t “act sooner”. The dem politicians in NY were encouraging people to go to Chinatown and out to Chinese New Year’s events at the very end of February, saying not to worry about this. DeBlasio told people on March 15th to “go to your favorite bar while you still can before we lock down”, encouraging masses of people to go out, and then these people were ridiculed by the same Democrats who encouraged them to do so. </p>
<p>I’m just over it. What in the world did they expect him to do? There was no stopping this, and testing was never the miracle fix they kept pushing and crying “he won’t get us enough tests!” Virus is gonna virus regardless of anything else.</p>

        <p>Reminds me of the person on r/Showerthoughts who hoped the virus would kill more people so we'd take masks and lockdowns seriously.</p>
<p>How about just not having masks or lockdowns because the virus isn't killing many people except those who are already dying?</p>
<p>And as an aside, why do these people have some of the stupidest selfies?</p>
