    <strong>Call to Arms: A Recap of Events and the Strategy Going Forward</strong>
    <p><p>Judging by the posts here these past few days, I think it's safe to say we are all growing anxious and more sure of retaliation as we are witnessing the demise of liberty across the globe. Here's what has happened in the past few days that has caused this "red alert", and a plan of action for our resistance.</p>
<p>France has set the tone for Europe and likely the rest of the West that vaccine passports will be mandatory to participate in civil society. Yeah, they plan to lock us out of bars, gyms, restaurants, but think of the effects of this years down the line. These governments will eventually prevent us from participating in all levels of democratic governance- we will not be able to participate in, or more significantly, run in elections, have our opinions heard, or be represented in Western government. We will not be allowed in voting facilities, we will not be allowed to seek an audience with those in power. And once this is done, they will certainly turn on us.</p>
<p>Three leaders of three nations who were some of, if not the only, leaders to oppose vaccinations have been assassinated. Haiti, Tanzania, Madagascar. All of their deaths are shrouded with mystery, and the literal only think linking them together was their refusal to import the vaccine to their people.</p>
<p>We literally know that the VACCINE DOES NOT EVEN WORK. It does not prevent you from getting Covid, it does not prevent you from spreading Covid. It is also known that this vaccine is ineffective against "variants", and with each serious mutation, booster shots will probably be required. Additionally, there are certainly many cases of adverse side effects killing otherwise healthy people. J&amp;J has had to issue a warning that their vaccine may cause a severe neural disorder. Pfizer had to retract their vaccine a few months ago for a short period of time. We also know that ALL of these companies have been involved in corrupt practices over the years - putting toxic ingredients in their formulas and coercing doctors to recommend it to their patients. Nothing has changed. For a vaccine that 1. doesn't work and 2. has serious side effects for at least a significant amount of people, there sure is a lot of pressure to get absolutely every human being to take it no matter how at risk they are to COVID. We all know this is suspicious.</p>
<p>The media and big tech are not even hiding their agenda anymore. They are deliberately utilizing "newspeak" - a phenomena I recommend you look into from the novel 1984 in which the talking heads speak in incredibly simple and repetitive terms, in unison, and blatantly contradict their narratives without anyone noticing. If the viewers do notice that they have told a lie, they are convinced that the are wrong. It is crazy listening to people on CNN, Psaki, Biden - they simply lie through their teeth and make shit up and do not think about it because they know for certain the media will back them. It does not matter what they say or do because the media will tell you what to think. Twitter is also blatantly a CCP tool. None of the hashtags are organic, and if god-forbid a republican hashtag should trend, twitter will immediately send in the bots to hijack the newsfeed and send their soyboy responses to the headlines. Seriously, next liberal hashtag you see, go through a few of the profiles participating. You will see they are nearly all bots. And if you have any doubts about point 4, just look to how Twitter and the media handled the Cuba riots. They simply labelled it as a protest to get more vaccines. What?! Guys - our media is literally on the side of tyrannical communism. China.</p>
<p>Biden has announced he hopes to have "civil groups" go door to door to coerce people into getting a vaccination. Holy fucking shit. He either 1. knows EXACTLY who is and is not vaccinated, or 2. knows how to find you. This is serious. We are in trouble. The deep state, all the information conglomerates, and the federal government are all ready to be mobilized against us. I fear that this sub will not last much longer, and once removed, we will face a serious lack of organizational strength. </p>
<p>Finally, the recent independent group in Georgia, VoterGA, has all but confirmed that the 2020 election was stolen. They have found actual evidence that ballots were scanned and counted twice, sometimes whole batches of votes going for Biden when in reality he only won less than half, and most importantly, that the audit and everyone telling you there was absolutely no fraud was flat out lying to you and apparently in on it. There was enough fraud found in one county, Fulton County, to cast Biden's win in Georgia into question, and if allowed similar access in other states, I wouldn't be surprised if we found this election was indeed stolen. </p>
<p>And finally, Biden has outright called people like you and me an "enemy of the Republic". Guys, he is literally telling the world that we must be destroyed. He is inciting a Civil War. Indeed, he actually called our resistance a greater threat than the Civil War. Something MUST be done.</p>
<p>Something sinister is going on. The extent of it, who knows, but we know we are up against some very powerful people with an exhaustive plan underway. And they are fooling most people. </p>
<p>Luckily, we heave each other. We are not alone, and we are not nearly as isolated and outnumbered as the media would like us to think. Half of Americans have at least not received their second shot. roughly 30% have straight up said no. Many who have, regret their choice and only did because they were coerced. Many others who have were probably elderly and "at risk". Our numbers, in reality, are formidable.</p>
<p>What needs to happen before things go out of control, fast, is we need to set up an organizational system. We need information, and we need ways of communication. I am volunteering to work on the informational side of things if you all can work together to set up a system of communication to persevere should this community go dark. And even if it doesn't, we need an effective way to sow doubt and distrust to the general public. They need to hear what we have to say.</p>
<p>Here is my call to arms:</p>
<p>I am asking all of you to spend roughly fifteen minutes digging up news articles and scientific or otherwise scholarly articles about the events that took place this past year. From the outbreak, to the 2020 election, to today and everything in between. Show me inconsistencies. Show me things that have been proven false. Show me their lies. Show me the truth in as many forms as possible. It is my goal to compile the narrative into a neat treatise, similar to Thomas Paine's "Common Sense". We'll call it "Critical Thinking". I'd love to receive some of your own works and thoughts and try to weave them all together. This needs to be done. </p>
<p>The time to move is now. DM me what you find. Thank you and God Bless.</p></p>

        <p>So, I have heard this stuff about the election. Is any of it actually legit, like with primary source documents? I find it fascinating but am unable to find sources that don't appear biased. Court records would be good for example but I haven't seen them anywhere.</p>

        <p>Yea. I heard a bit of the hearing and the system was breached several times. I saw something like 37k unknown queries to the system? Also something about the passwords being all the same (like the factory default password) for administrative accounts. Wtf? Anyone heard about this?</p>

        <p>Good post and I think the body of your thoughts is very possible.</p>
<p>You don't call people enemies for no reason. You don't push to expel normal people from normal activities in society if you are trying to keep a society. We are on the edge of this thing right now, many here understand, and this is where the headspace needs to be. I'm getting worried that too many are simply unable to stand up for true human rights at this point in time.</p>
