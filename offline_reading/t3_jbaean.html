        <p>A lot of the 1% wish they were dead too.  Can you imagine being locked in a nursing home, unable to see your family at all during your last months.  They have turned nursing homes into prison.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I was once in a car accident at age 18, Cops showed up, I said I wanted to be dead (not kill myself mind you). I wasn’t serious I was just frustrated. Well of course the dumb fucking lug who showed up had to act super literal and wouldn’t listen to me explain that I wasn’t actually serious and took me to a mental ward at a hospital and my parents had to come pick me up from later that night.</p>

        <p>So true, CDC said over 1600 Americans die every day of heart disease. Everyday... for years.. no one blinks an eye, no one has ever suggested locking down fast food, the government hasn't forced anyone to go to the gym. Only about 3 days did Covid surpass heart disease as the daily killer.</p>

        <p>Sure. I imagine that a lot of 92 year olds with dementia wouldve died a few months sooner. 🤷‍♀️</p>
<p>We would be closer to be done with this mess, too. This  shows exactly why we shouldnt lockdown and why we dont lockdown for the flu. It is extending the misery instead if ripping off the bandaid. Lockdowns only work if they're permanent.</p>

        <p>The insane intellectual dishonesty of comparing seatbelt wearing to forcing the entire society into masks is beyond belief.</p>
<p>I’m assuming don’t <em>really</em> think this is a reasonable comparison. I’m assuming you are just another interchangeable wannabe tyrant thug who is using this type of phony baloney smokescreen as a tactic to continue bossing others around and advocating your mask-cult tyranny.</p>

        <p>&rt;  to forcing the entire society into masks </p>
<p>Are you aware you don't have to wear a seatbelt if you're on your couch at home?</p>
<p>Are you aware you don't have to wear a mask if you're on your couch at home. </p>
<p>The comparaison isn't perfect, but it still is relevant. You just don't agree with the comparaison because it shatters your whole "mask shouldn't be mandatory" opinion.</p>
<p>Some things in life are mandatory, and you don't agree with that because you can't grasp them. You just don't understand the world around you and you're scared and you're trying to convince yourself that you know better, even tho you have no FUCKING idea what you're talking about.</p>

        <p>Spain has extremely strict mask mandates, both indoors and outdoors. Really stopped their second set of infections huh? Almost nowhere with a mask mandate has seen a real decline. Spain is just one example. There are dozens of countries with varying levels of mask mandates that aren't working. The real data has gone against any mechanistic study.</p>

        <p>No. You don't get to shift the argument anymore. You do not get to go from "masks will keep cases low and controlled" to "they are not 100% effective, but they're still a good idea". I'm sorry, but there has been enough gaslighting and I have had it. Either they work, or they don't. All those mechanistic studies done in highly controlled labs said so, but they don't seem to have translated well into the real world.</p>
<p>My country said we can open up universities safely with masks, so we did. Everyone has to wear a mask the correct way and at all times. They are <strong>strictly</strong> enforced by our professors too. Temperatures are taken every hour. We sit apart from each other and groups have been split to only allow max 12 people per group.</p>
<p>Guess what happened yesterday? The minister of education made all unis online for 2 weeks because apparently there were too many infections coming from unis. So that's just another reinforcement of my own observations of real world data.</p>
<p>So if they're not able to stop it or slow it down, then why are we still doing it?</p>

<p>My statements ARE (And those are real quote, not made up bullshit quotes): "Mask have been proven to significantly prevent the spread of COVID." <em>and</em> "Just because something isn't 100% effective it doesn't mean we shouldn't use/enforce them."</p>

<p>They do work. They just ain't 100% effective. Like a contraceptive pill. They do work, but are not 100% effective. <strong>There's thousands of other example of things that work, but are not 100% effective, yet they are still widely acceptable.</strong></p>

<p>Well, you guessed wrong, literally no one here is flat-earth.</p>
<p>Everybody here is vaccinated and is pro-vax. Some people are just a bit more skeptical of such a rushed vaccine and the vaccine companies are shooting themselves in the foot if they want to be trusted but they are being exempt from liability of injuries.</p>

<p>Not you. I generalized, I should have specified. I was talking about the whole pro-mask and lockdown advocates. For example, the CDC director said if we wear masks for just 8 weeks then it would be gone, yet so many places prove that claim wrong.</p>
<p>&rt;Those two statements are true, and can be proven with scientific sources</p>
<p>No. You can prove it true with studies that are either computer/mathematical models or highly controlled mechanistic studies done in sterile labs. Most of those use N95 masks too, which are arguably the most effective. I've read a good bunch of those studies, and their conclusions are almost always "may be", "might", "in theory". However, I don't think it is a good idea or science based to create broad mandates with threats of jail or fines based on such studies or conclusions.</p>
<p>Every time I see another mechanistic study advocating in favor of masks I'm always reminded of this.</p>
<p>https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article</p>
<p>&rt;Although mechanistic studies support the potential effect of hand hygiene or face masks, evidence from 14 randomized controlled trials of these measures did not support a substantial effect on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza</p>
<p>Again, the evidence is weak, which is the cited reason why the Scandinavian countries and The Netherlands don't mandate masks. Let's say that they do reduce rates of infection. Some percentages I've seen cited in other places is like a 2-5% reduction, although I can't recall what study. Is it worth all this animosity between people, all this anger and disruption, the fines and the arrests, the public shaming and cancelling for just a 2-5% reduction?</p>

<p>You can, and they did it, and they know it helps. </p>
<p><strong>You link an outdated research, and it's about the influenza. The actual CDC recommands the wear of masks.</strong></p>
<p><em>Masks are recommended as a simple barrier to help prevent respiratory droplets from traveling into the air and onto other people when the person wearing the mask coughs, sneezes, talks, or raises their voice. This is called source control. This recommendation is based on what we know about the role respiratory droplets play in the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, paired with emerging evidence from clinical and laboratory studies that shows masks reduce the spray of droplets when worn over the nose and mouth.</em></p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html</p>
<p>Fuck your outdated sources about influenza. They are worth nothing.</p>

<p>&rt;You link an outdated research, and it's about the influenza. The actual CDC recommands the wear of masks.</p>
<p>Your point? How is it outdated? Did we suddenly learn something in these last few months that we haven't been able to for the past few decades?</p>
<p>You do realize this doesn't help your argument look any better? Influenza and COVID spread in the same way: respiratory droplets. The same measures that should work for COVID should also work for the flu. Plus, the spread of the flu is slower than COVID. If masks can't stop something spreading slower, how will it stop somehing spreading faster?</p>
<p>The problem is when we take evidence from poorly done studies or studies that aren't high quality. Models and mechanistic studies aren't considered high quality. Randomized Controlled Trials are the highest quality form of research in the world of scientific research. I don't recall a single RCT for this virus being done yet.</p>
<p>The source I cited was a review of <strong>14</strong> RCTs. For me that is better evidence.</p>

        <p>I've been called selfish a lot. Maybe it's true. But it's human nature to care most about the people close to us. I don't know a single person who's had a severe case of covid. </p>
<p>I do know a person currently trapped in an emotionally abusive relationship who can't afford to leave because no jobs around her are hiring after her country's harsh lockdown. I know a person who has trouble wearing a mask because it brings back PTSD flashbacks of being suffocated by her rapist. I know multiple people with depression who have told me they feel like there's nothing to live for because everything that brings them joy is cancelled. </p>
<p>Sure, I don't want my loved ones to die of covid. No one does. But I don't want them to die by suicide either, and for young, physically healthy people, suicide is the higher risk.</p>

        <p>Just know that you're not alone. I read 25% of young people have considered suicide in the past month. I pray that you don't do it. I know you've probably heard it before but by killing yourself any pain you are feeling gets dumped onto your family and they have to suffer because of your choice. My dad tried committing suicide a couple years ago, had he been successful our family would be destroyed, don't be too quick to think that they'll be fine without you or that they do care about you, my dad thought the same things and everything in his mind told him that was the case. What part of this is making you want to die? If you could find an short daily escape from lockdown-life do you think you would fair better?</p>

        <p>Maybe. For me, a huge part of my pain with lockdown is that the only people I can be around don't want me around. I am transgender and they really don't like that. They make fun of me constantly. They think it's funny and harass me. If I didn't have to be trapped with them it would be better.</p>

        <p>Are they religious at all? If they are I'd hate to stoke flames (though it may be necessary) by calling them hypocrites and rebuke them for not having love in their hearts (this doesn't mean they have to affirm you being transgender but they still need to love you as their child). If they aren't religious then they have no twisted reason to behave in such a manner. Hate to hear you're going through this.</p>

        <p>Yes. I have a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria, which for those who don't know, means I am constantly in pain because of the fact I was born as the sex I am. I cannot stand being a man. I cannot stand being called one. But my parents value their comfort over my feelings. There's a reason transgender people have a suicide rate of 40 percent. It's because of that dysphoria and nobody caring, or even worse, being awful about it</p>

        <p>Yep. And the insane, sad part is that I bet if you polled the entire population of the country, the vast majority of people would think <em>at least</em> 1% of the population had died of Covid, if not several percent. Whereas it’s only .06%. About half of one tenth of 1%. If 1% of the US population had died, that would be 3.2 MILLION. Pretty big difference. All the media does is report big numbers, 200,000!!!, but they never put any of them into any kind of context. And people are fucking dumb and are incapable of basic math, research skills, and critical thinking.</p>

        <p>At the end of the day it is psychological. Reason and facts won’t persuade most of these people. They are scared and locking people up and masks makes them feel safe. People have to be trained to act normally again by going out and experiencing not getting sick. Trump being overweight and 74 and getting over it in three days will have more of an impact than all the charts and data in the world.</p>

        <p>It's an interesting thought experiment though. I wanna ask these liberal authoritarians: how many poor black children need to suffer from poverty and difficult online education for each white old man saved from Covid. Is it 10:1? 100:1? With their logic it is more like 1000:1.</p>
<p>Remember when we cared about the most vulnerable?</p>
<p>Oh.. and authorities didn't care when there was a much more prevalent AIDs epidemic. Interesting that they care about epidemics this time... really shows how trustworthy they are.</p>

        <p>It worse than that: they don’t care about either of those things. </p>
<p>Think about which countries and cities are imposing the most strict control measures. Now, who benefits most from people being cooped up, afraid and doing everything online?</p>
<p>Tech companies, banks and news media. </p>
<p>Tech like Amazon, netflix, etc. Banks because they make money off of every cashless transaction. New media because clicks sell ads. </p>
<p>Where are ALL of those companies located? You got it: New York, California and the major hubs of Europe and Asia. </p>
<p>Notice which government entities are being most draconian and complicit in all this? They don’t have anything to lose; their personal health and economies and the personal economies of their friends and biggest donors will be just fine. </p>

        <p>Mom or dad are far more likely to die in a car wreck on their way to the grocery store than of covid. </p>
<p>Imagine having smart, good parents who realize the threat of this to the healthy population (and hell even the unhealthy, the death rate is so low even they’re dying very rarely) is insanely low and encourage activities that promote mental health and happiness, and are willing to accept the overly minimal risk so their kids can have happy lives.</p>

        <p>Are you fucking kidding me? I’m sorry usually I don’t feed the trolls or doomers but seriously? Gamble on my parents’ lives? Again, they are statistically way more likely to die of a number of things they do <em>every day</em> and have been for years and years. They’re more likely to have heart attacks and die than die of covid. They’re more likely to die in a car wreck. They’re more likely to have strokes that kill them, or aneurisms, hell the flu is just as likely to kill them as covid and that’s not even a statistically significant likelihood. </p>
<p>Get out of here with that. Like it’d be laughable if I wasn’t so concerned that people think this way. If your parents are sickly and super high risk, yes I’d see being cautious. But otherwise? Again, the chance they die of covid isn’t even statistically significant it’s that close to 0. </p>
<p>Also again, some parents actually have their children’s best interest in mind and support them continuing their lives and being mentally and physically happy and healthy. My dad literally said these words to me “I’m not going to, but if something happened and I died of covid, you’re not allowed to blame yourself or anyone else and regret going out and going places and beat yourself up”. Because he’s a good dad. He’s lived many awesome years and while he’s not at risk of losing his life now to this, he knows that even if he were his kids are at a point where we need to be out having our good years and living and not destroying our lives and mental health. I’m done, rant over, I’m glad my family has some brain cells.</p>

<p>How can you even think that's a point to make. "Hur dur you already have X chance to die from Y, so who cares if you have a slight chance to die from Z". That's not a point. What the fuck. </p>
<p>By your STUPID logic, we shouldn't worry about anything that has a lower chance than dying from a car accident? "Hur dur, you have 1 out of 106 chance of dying from a car accident, so don't worry about aids dude". Logicless baboon. </p>
<p>&rt; Also again, some parents actually have their children’s best interest in mind and support them continuing their lives and being mentally and physically happy and healthy.</p>
<p>You can be happy in a lockdown. <strong>Stop using the lockdown as an excuse why you're a sad incel with no friends</strong>.  You're a sad fucking incel EXACTLY because you're the kind of moron who argue that a lockdown isn't good and mask are "bad".</p>

They are the same folks who cough when a cigarette is in their proximity, scientifically they believe that being shut in a garage with one person smoking will be worse for them than sitting in the same garage with one car idling.  You can't convince them otherwise so best to just smoke at all times to keep them away from you.</p>
