    <strong>The Plan From the Beginning Should Have Been Voluntary Infection</strong>
    <p><p>In Feb/March once they knew that covid wasn't deadly to healthy people, they should have been screening for those with no underlying conditions and offering to voluntarily infect them with covid then having them stay in designated hotels for monitoring until their symptoms disappeared. The message could have been "get covid to save grandma."</p></p>

        <p>I would’ve done it. Not like there was anything else interesting happening. If they used that time to infect young healthy people while the lockdowns were first happening, I’m guessing you could’ve gotten solid buy in.</p>

        <p>I would've done this in a heartbeat. As a matter of fact, I remember reading an article about this in March (found it after some digging: https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/25/how-medical-chickenpox-parties-could-turn-the-tide-of-the-wuhan-virus/). Twitter temporarily locked the account of the Federalist,  the magazine that published it, and deleted the tweet linking to it, as punishment for "violating the Twitter Rules regarding COVID-19". The usual suspects blabbered about how it was "dangerous" and encouraging everyone to go get sick at parties, which actually wasn't at all what the very nonpartisan doctor who wrote it was saying; he wanted "controlled voluntary infections" in a medically monitored setting. The Federalist just changed the title to be more clickbait-y, Twitter saw the title and decided to go full fascist on them, and the bootlickers on the "left" applauded. Anyway, at the time I read it, I thought the virus was way more deadly than it actually turned out to be, but I was also so miserable over lockdowns etc that I didn't much care if I died. So I was sitting in my car thinking "if only there was a program to let people do this! I'd sign up in a millisecond, and if I die of it I die a hero!" Looking back, if this program was really put into place, it would've been more like "get a cough and sore throat and recover a hero", or possibly "have nothing happen to you because you already got covid, recovered and got the antibodies, live a hero". Of course, the public acclaim for my heroism would've probably lasted less than 2 seconds once I got out into the world and attempted to hang out with other human beings like a normal person.</p>

        <p>We should have at least discussed the idea of giving young healthy people the coronaviruses that cause common colds. If there’s any cross immunity at all with SARS-CoV 2 this would have worked as a “natural” vaccine and would have saved lives. No one even wanted to discuss this strategy. It was lockdown and wait for an unproven big Pharma vaccine that we have no safety data on for more than a few months.</p>

        <p>Why would anyone do this though? Even if you're young and healthy and unlikely to die...sure, you would go about your daily life risking being infected, but why would you <em>deliberately</em> choose to be infected? You'd need to take time off work, you'd be imprisoned for an indefinite time period, there's no compensation other than a sense of "doing good". What motivation would people have to participate?</p>

        <p>&rt; Once you develop the antibodies, you have basically 0 risk.</p>
<p>Before you develop the antibodies you also have basically 0 risk, at least if you're a young healthy person (the ones you're suggesting take part in this)</p>
<p>&rt; To develop antibodies in a controlled manner so you don’t risk infecting people who are vulnerable to serious illness/death.</p>
<p>That's not a good enough motivation. People have nothing to gain personally from it. So it follows that there's no reason they would. Most people have better things to do with their time than being infected and quarantined indefinitely - work, family, hobbies etc.</p>
