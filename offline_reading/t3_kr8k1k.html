    <strong>My experience breaking lockdown rules</strong>
    <p><p>During the entire lockdown I've not followed a single rule &amp; haven't ever been punished. </p>
<p>Since the lockdown started in March I kept hearing stories of people being fined for breaching lockdown rules so I've put it to test over 100 times &amp; haven't ever been penalised. </p>
<p>Firstly with masks, if someone tells you to put a mask on, say you're exempt. Legally no one (including the police) can ask why you're exempt, I've never worn one &amp; never been asked why. </p>
<p>Secondly, stay indoors; every time the government have told us to stay indoors I've made more of an effort to get outdoors. I go on walks, runs &amp; quite frankly I do whatever I want (that's open). </p>
<p>Thirdly, mixing of households; I've never ever stopped mixing households, I've continued to have parties at friends houses, go to families houses &amp; travel up and down the country &amp; I've not once been told off or penalised for it. People need to rebel &amp; stop being controlled. </p>
<p>The media refuse to post anything about the antilockdown protests that are happening in every city across the UK. Social media pages refuse to allow any organisation of the protests too. The police arrested 13 protestors in London 2 weeks ago for breaching lockdown yet thousands of people who were supporting BLM were free too protests ammid the peak of the pandemic. </p>
<p>Do people think that the lockdowns are justified when the death rate for COVID (86) is older than the average natural death age (85). They're locking down 100% of the population, making 99% suffer with depression, raising the suicide rate by 3x, delaying 90% cancer patents key surgery all to protect 1% of the population from a virus that has a 99.6% survival rate.</p></p>

        <p>Totally agree. It's psychological. People who are a bit older or a bit anxious think some weird force will punish them. NO ONE WILL CARE. There are a few bedwetters but the vast VAST majority let you do what you want. We're going into a third lockdown, I'm booking a holiday as we speak!</p>

        <p>I'm 6"5 &amp; well built so I think that helps with people not telling me what to do. I get the train every day &amp; I see everyone around me scared to take their masks off, I feel sorry for them. Are you not worried about your holiday getting canceled? &amp; where are you looking to go if you don't mind me asking?</p>

        <p>Lucky you! I guess as a woman I feel more under threat., I'm 5 foot 7 and I don't get intimidated easily. It's harder for tiny people. BUT I still feel a bit nervous at times. I've had a drippy looking guy shake his head cos I wasn't wearing a mask on the tube. We were the only people in the carriage and so far apart! So lame. And I've had a few other small things. But I feel that things are getting worse. Do you feel the same in the UK? It's like...people are doubling down and getting MORE paranoid. BUT at the same time a whole heap of others are ignoring the rules. In terms of holidays, I've decided I'm going to entirely live my life now. We are not coming out of this soon. So fuck it. I will take control and do what I want. If I'm fined...will deal with it. And if the flight's cancelled, that's life. I fly BA so they give you vouchers. And only going where there's no quarantine. So many have been flying. I feel I've been too 'good' largely because my lifestyle isn't conducive to huge rule breaking (obviously I've broken the rules but not gone out there to do so deliberately or travelled that much - although was in Ibiza and Greece last year, Cornwall and France. But I want to do more!) Oh, and I'm looking to go ANYWHERE with no quarantine. Probably in Feb. Sweden when they open up or Madeira when it's warmer. End of January I will probably go within UK and hire Airbnb.</p>

        <p>Yeah I completely understand. Sounds crazy but I'm waiting for the day someone gives me a weird look or says something because I'll just throw facts at them &amp; make them feel stupid. In summer I said fuck it and went traveling round Europe on coach with my girlfriend. Spent 35 days traveling, because there isn't any hard boarders in the shenzen zone it was easy. Look into it! I'm looking at doing it again because if the coaches get canceled you just get a train (spent £1000 each for 8 Air BnB's &amp; 8 different countries &amp; a flight back from budapest). If they bring out this 'vaccine passport' I swear to god it'll cause riots because the only thing getting me through this lockdown is the idea of traveling.</p>

        <p>Ha ha that sounds cool ! I'm more into going to one place, villa, holiday home and chilling these days - but want to do lots of separate trips. In terms of a vaccine passport, it won't be possible. Pregnant women can't have it, nor can those with allergies. How can they make them? So it will just mean we have to do tests, which is fine (I guess) and the hysteria will have died down by then anyway.</p>

        <p>Good. Keep it up.</p>
<p>I know the depression and anxiety thing all too well. But if we can't hamdle a little adversity then what good are we as human beings? That's why, even before we knew how impotent this virus actually is, that I would continue going to work and not living my life in fear. I've lost some friends because I chose this path but it is what it is.</p>

        <p>Agree. It's SO relieving and freeing to just take control not care and let people go who don't fit in your new life any more. It's so wonderful to do this and everyone should. Fear is so dark and produces such negative emotions.</p>

        <p>They got scared and rage-quit me, and it still hurts but at the same time I am better off without such people in my sphere of consciousness during these trying times. I try and avoid people who cling to their fear and hatred, as it only brings me down. Negativity is contageous. I'd rather stay neutral, keep it real. </p>
<p>Not saying I'm immune to fear or anything like that. We all act weird sometimes when we are under stress. I can forgive that.</p>

        <p>Bang on, I'm in the UK and I have NEVER been questioned for not wearing a mask. Us Brits hate confrontation.</p>
<p>I have been ratted on to the police when I broke tier 3 restrictions. I went to a bar with 2 friends and invited them back to my place for a few more drinks. Music on etc. Friends left at 2am. Lights in my house off. Police showed up at 4am, banging on my door. Did I answer? No, because that would open up a huge can of worms! They went away.</p>
<p>Me and my friends threw a party on his rooftop terrace in the middle of a bustling city after the first lockdown ended. No drama, infact we had people from the street coming up and joining in, no joke. Still don't know how we got away with that to this day!</p>
<p>New Years Eve, we got together. Walked out of my friends house at 10am New Years Day with a set of DJ Decks in my hand. The looks from the people in the street were striking.</p>
<p>I went travelling around Europe for 1 full month just as the first lockdown ended. I haven't stopped living my life were possible.</p>
<p>Strange how it was totally okay to drink with my friends in a bar, but not in my own property. See, Brits will NEVER confront you to your face. They will however rat you out behind your back and more than likely gloat about it on social media.</p>
<p>We defeated the nazis but now it seems we've inherited their trates.</p>
<p>Our ancestors will be turning in their graves at how cowardly this nation has become.</p>

        <p>You sound exactly like me! I traveled from London &rt; Paris &rt; Brussels &rt; Bruges &rt; Amsterdam &rt; Frankfurt &rt; Berlin &rt; Prague &rt; Bratislava &rt;  Vienna &rt; Budapest. I don't understand how people are letting a virus with a 99.6% survival rate control their life.</p>
<p>Did the right thing not opening your door, because breaking lockdown isn't an indictable offence they aren't allowed to enter your home. All about power and control, they're testing to see how many people actually rebel, more people need to stand up against the government before it turns into full blown communism in this country.</p>

        <p>I feel annoyed I didn't do more in the first lockdown now. Definitely going out of my way to ignore all rules for this one. Out of my way! I find it so odd that some people literally still sanitise their groceries and are terrified for their lives. Some people have not seen their families for A YEAR! I mean...I actually don''t have that much sympathy. If you can't determine your own risk. then you need to learn and fast.  I also hate it when people say you are 'putting yourself in danger' like...whatever. I have next to no chance of dying. And this long covid stuff...ok sure. But we don't know much about it yet. I think people basically hate their lives. So many. They hate their lives, jobs, normality and this is a break for them - furloughed or not even furloughed, but wfh. Sad.</p>

        <p>On masks, I've been asked three times in the supermarket why I'm not wearing one, by their assigned 'Covid Marshalls'. On two occasions I blatantly ignored them, walked past and nothing more came of it. The other time I uttered a quiet 'no' without making eye contact and walked on. Again nothing came of it. Aside from that I've had one or two nasty looks and mutterings from other customers, and a sense that others often make a point of moving out of the way when I approach.</p>

        <p>I agreed, I’m planning on seeing my boyfriend in the next week or so, only thing is he lives up north a few hours away from me and I'm up for taking the risk but if I’m honest I am a little worried when I get to the train station if I’ll get stopped and what I should exactly say, any ideas? Or will even get stopped?</p>
