    <strong>Might end up homeless during my overseas studies because I am not vaccinated</strong>
    <p><p>Sorry for the post, I really need to rant somewhere or I am going insane. I am in my 4th semester now at uni and I need to study 1 semester abroad in order to complete my degree. Last year I applied for studying in UK and I got accepted into an exchange program I can't opt out of anymore at this point. Everything is prepared and I was looking forward to living there but... finding a flat for 6 months has become a nightmare. I really need an UK address soon to provide or I am not allowed to enter the UK at all. I keep sending out 30 applications every day, most of the time people reject me because I am not vaccinated... I don't know what to do. This is my body right? I react bad to vaccines in general, a normal vaccine makes my entire arm go numb for 2 weeks, I even got hospitalized once for reacting bad to one. Even my doctor told me to not get the Covid vaccine because it might kill me. I just want a place to stay at during my studies but I am being discriminated against... If I can't find anything within the next 3 weeks it's over for me. I have been getting nightmares about this every day for a while now because my entire course of studies might get ruined just because I don't want a vaccine. I am scared of being homeless in a foreign country I don't know anyone at.</p>
<p>If anyone of you happens to live in the UK around Nottingham and can help me, pls DM me.</p></p>

        <p>Jesus. Sorry to hear what you’re going through. Are you applying for university accommodation or private renting? Also what kind of evidence do they ask for to check you’re vaccinated? </p>
<p>I’m a postgrad student but in London. I don’t know anyone around Nottingham but might be able to help in finding a place to rent and could definitely help avoiding homelessness if it comes to it.</p>
