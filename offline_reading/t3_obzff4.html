    <strong>Here's how to not be depressed</strong>
    <p><p>I've read several posts here of people here being depressed. Here's how not to be.</p>
<p>Whenever something bad happens, how you respond is entirely up to you. You can be depressed, or you can be angry.</p>
<p>Be angry.</p>
<p>And use this anger as motivation. Motivation to change your circumstances. What makes you angry? </p>
<p>Is it the censorship? Make your own facebook. Don't know how? Learn. Destroy Zuckerberg.</p>
<p>Is it the politics? Become a politician, become the president. Don't know how? Learn.</p>
<p>Is it your friends and family? Make new friends. Don't know how? Learn. Approach random people on the street if you have to.</p>
<p>Is it your local government? Move. Don't have enough money? Make some. Don't know how? Learn.</p>
<p>Is it your job, boss, coworkers? Sabotage them, Get fired. Get a new job, start a business, and don't employ the injected.</p>
<p>Depression is a choice. There's an array of negative emotions to choose from when faced with a negative event. Depression is not a useful emotion. Choose anger.</p>
<p>Even if they pin you down and force inject you. Just endure it. And never forget, and work every minute to make them pay.</p></p>
