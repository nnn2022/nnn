        <p>People are so quick to push the blame onto Trump and anti-maskers. </p>
<p>How about you take a fucking look at the American population before the virus. We're extremely overweight and obese (66%+), we work sedentary long hours, we don't get enough exercise, our diets are shit. </p>
<p>You would think this corona shit would be a wake up call for people to start improving their health.</p>

        <p>I have a friend in Ontario, Canada, and our brief discussions about care has made it sound like there’s negligible difference in availability. Just cost. And sometimes the wait time to get in is significant there, same as here.</p>
<p>Theirs is fully subsidized by the gov’t unless you have some sort of specialized need which the gov’t won’t pay for testing around. Her bro had some serious difficulties a couple years ago and was testing for lyme’s and potential venomous spider bite and whatever else, trying to sort out what was going on, and the family ended up sending out for a test to the US because it wasn’t part of accepted protocol, so wasn’t available in Canada. </p>
<p>Totally vague, but my memory isn’t great. </p>
<p>Conversely, I haven’t had medical insurance most of my adult life, but when emergencies come up have still been able to access care and get subsidized rates or indigent coverage. I worked with a portion of the population which are on the state-subsidized coverage for a few years, assisting with accessing care, and they were able to get visits everywhere pretty easily. </p>
<p>If anything, the quality may be marginal due to the approach to medicine prevalent in the US—largely about controlling symptoms rather than identifying and mitigating contributing causes. For instance, giving cholesterol meds rather than nutrition counsel and exercise, because it’s considered genetic and largely unaffected by diet (or at least that’s what one of my clients was told while I was present). And diet colas are still de rigeur advisory for diabetics, despite the complications to insulin regulation still involved. </p>
<p>But then, a friend from China was advised in the 90s to pray to a demon/idol as part of the medical advice given to her family, so I don’t think we’re necessarily where we could be either. </p>
<p>I’ve never had difficulty getting in somewhere, and the doc I’ve recently had has been accommodating in terms of my preference to use nutrition and supplementation to deal with ailments rather than meds...she kind of mocks it, but I really don’t care. </p>
<p>There are so many conglomerates now—I don’t know the proper term, but nearest equivalency—Carilion, LewisGale, etc., and quality of care has diminished due to overarching requirements hereby. All about maximum profit (gov’t subsidized, largely, as the recipient of Medicaid/Medicare clientele), so all about churn—get people in and out, period. Which strikes me as being very similar to the situation in Canada, with total gov’t regulation of the healthcare system. The further we move toward that model, the more quality of care declines: the more litigious and over-beaurocratized, less personal investment in the profession. But if we go full-socialist, then I assume the income won’t be an incentive any longer due to wage regulation...from what my Ukrainian friend has told me, her engineer parents raised her in basically poverty. Because, you know...standard living wage distributed to all citizens means equality across the board, I guess? So I don’t know how that one would play out in terms of further diminishing quality of care? How is medical care in Venezuela, for consideration?</p>
<p>Tl;dr: Not personally about taking Pills, so I have minimal use for our Medical system. But there’s availability of care if you take initiative, and the care is not as wonky as I’ve heard is the case in some other countries...if you find a thinking, invested doc, at least.</p>

        <p>You are fortunate to have little need for healthcare in the US, but it is truly a clusterfuck of administrative BS and arbitrary and absurd pricing.  A series of tests can set you back hundreds, potentially thousands of dollars, and even a short hospital stay can reach $10k and above, and this is all even with insurance.</p>
<p>A good friend of mine was hit by a car last year, and was not at fault at all, and he is fighting the drivers insurance to get his medical bills paid, and if they don’t, he’s 100% on the hook.  This is a nightmare system, you are one accident away from finding that out for yourself.</p>

        <p>No instead we need to make ourselves weaker by wearing masks, obsessively cleaning “high touch surfaces,” washing our hands a bazillion times a day and staying inside and away from others. </p>
<p>And don’t even think about saying people need to be responsible for themselves. That just leads to “You don’t have the right to infect meeee!” foot stomping and a convoluted explanation of how they can get the virus from you without you ever encountering them. A high percentage of Americans also expect everyone to take care of them and the government to keep giving them more free money. Taking responsibility for themselves is offensive to just even suggest.</p>

        <p>I work in healthcare, of course I support these restrictions because people were dying in the beginning before the restrictions were really taken seriously. You lost your job, but at least you didn’t end up like the 200,000 that died. It wasn’t like washing your hands before/after eating, bathroom use, etc. was such a taboo before this.

        <p>You are blaming the wrong people dude. Your employer easily could’ve kept you on, but they wanted to preserve profits over their employees. Without these restrictions we would’ve lost so many more family members and friends, but at least you would’ve kept your precious job</p>

        <p>No they couldn’t have. I was a seasonal employee. There was no way for me to stay when we were shut down. And yes my job is goddamn important to me. It’s what matters to me because I get paid that way. Why does someone like you even work in healthcare when you have no sympathy for others? So you can get media attention and free gifts?</p>

        <p>And no, you’re complaining about something that’s very temporary. These restrictions won’t last forever, you’ll get another job that you love and things will gradually return to where they were in time. I highly suggest seeking counseling/therapy for yourself if you’re going to talk about “rather be dead than living like this”. Get some perspective. I personally almost lost my life and have lost close family friends to COVID-19, if you haven’t then I’m happy to hear you haven’t dealt with that pain. But you’re going to sit over here and say “I don’t personally give a shit about anybody outside of my family and I won’t follow restrictions”, like really? That’s so shitty to say. I do sympathize with losing a job that you loved, but when you’re so clearly not going to be empathetic to others but ask for empathy, you’re going to get called out</p>

        <p>Here is my last response, I have a night shift to attend to. Healthcare workers are proposing such as a scare tactic to get people to take this seriously now, so we don't have to actually deal with this for much longer. If people like you keep not having a shred of care for others in their communities (I don't give a damn if you don't care about me, its obvious you only really care for yourself and your own well-being). We have treatments coming out to fight this virus and are making a lot of headway in understanding it fully and how to fight it so it isn't as prevalent a threat to those at risk. </p>
<p>I don't have to justify why I am in healthcare to a reddit troll, I love my job, hope every one of my patients leaves this hospital on their own two feet and that's it. We have taken pay-cuts, some left and some didn't. </p>
<p>Your rights are the same as mine, we all have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. By not following a mask mandate and ensuring you don't possibly spread it to others you infringe on the rights of others. </p>
<p>Lastly, seek counseling, talk to somebody and vent all of this anger out, it's misplaced. If you need to call a hotline like this one 1-866-310-7977, its free and confidential. I do hope you find happiness and empathy for others, good luck.</p>

        <p>Sorry about your job, but that’s got nothing to do with me.  Other callous people in this sub would tell you it’s your fault for not being personally responsible.  I won’t, because I’m not an asshole like that, but it makes no sense to take out your frustration on other regular people who have no power to change any of this.  </p>
<p>Blame your employer, blame the government officials who didn’t take this seriously enough in the beginning.  Blame capitalism for equating a person’s wealth with their sense of worth.  America is a broken country that is built to serve the rich against the interests of working people, and you were one of millions at the receiving end of this during the pandemic.  We could support all people who have become jobless, it’s just that republicans refuse to do it.  </p>
<p>It was never an option to not lock down and make restrictions for public health reasons.  You gotta accept that and move on, I guarantee it will help at least a little with your mental health.</p>

        <p>I actually am a conservative. We need to lift all restrictions now and get people back to work. We had other options to not shut down and make restrictions. The curve is flat. Hospitalizations are declining in my state. If they’re not in another state that doesn’t affect me. </p>
<p>I’m not willing to change my POV on restrictions. They were an overreaction. I should have been allowed to work and attend church in person as long as I was comfortable. I should be allowed to not wear a mask if I choose not to. The only thing I would do is not go out if I had symptoms. The fact that I lost five months of income and happiness at my job and my right to worship in person and sing hymns concerns me more than the health of some stranger. I’m sorry. I will never forgive people like you or the government for what they did while people like you cheered it on.</p>

The free market will not help us reduce working hours or increase access to healthy food, so either way, the government has to be a part of the solution.

        <p>Trump thought it would be funny to tell people to drink disinfectant because it can help with the virus. When called out on it, he said it was a joke. A joke that landed many in the hospital. Your president golfs while the death toll rises. He even brushed corona off before it was <em>as bad</em>, thinking it wasn’t a big deal. Well now we’re in the shit with worse to come.</p>
<p>Anti-maskers deny that Corona is even a thing or are downplaying it because why on earth should they be forced to wear a mask for a 20 minutes to grab groceries for just a measly cough, right? What about my rights? I guess doctors who have been wearing masks for years are just doing it for shits and giggles then?</p>
<p>Your president failed his country and anti-maskers are making it worse. This isn’t about improving your health (although it’s quarantine so be productive), this is about following the easiest guidelines (wear a fucking mask and social distance you donut) to make sure your safe, and the others around you are safe.</p>

        <p>I can’t wrap my head around how much more impactful for a society it is losing portions of its next generation vs having people at the end of their natural lifespan pass away.

        <p>I've grown allergic to words like "empathy", "compassion" etc. recently. As far as I can tell people who say they value those words really mean they value "hating on people who disagree with me". Talk about how lockdowns made you suicidal, suddenly they aren't so "caring". Not that that'll stop them from trumpeting "September is suicide prevention month it's ok to reach out for help" bullshit at the same time they're telling anti-lockdown people to just go die already</p>

        <p>This honestly just demonstrates the arrogance of man, believing that natural events that happen more frequently than we realize are within our control. Our emotions and feelings mean nothing in the context of nature.</p>
