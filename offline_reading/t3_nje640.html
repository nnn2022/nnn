    <strong>I played the Chris Sky video for my parents without any context.</strong>
    <p><p>I played the audio from the Chris Sky video from last summer (Prophet Chad one) for my parents and all I said was "hey guys, this is a recording from last summer, listen and tell me that you think." They didn't know who Chris Sky is or how hated he is by doomers in Canada so they were completely unbiased and I really enjoyed their reactions.</p>
<p>My dad is the most based person I know. Cancer Survivor (refused chemotherapy, researched like a mad man for the cure), knew the pandemic was a scam much before I did, knows the government and Big Pharma don't give a shit about our health and is losing his business because of the restrictions in BC. His reaction to the audio was to open his eyes really wide and say "if this is from last year this guy predicted everything perfectly, holy shit, send me that now!" I asked him if any of what he said was wrong or crazy and his answer was "what, no? This is exactly what is happening to us now."</p>
<p>My mom is not as based and would probably follow everything the MSM says if it weren't for my dad talking sense into her. She tends to be the one in the family who always gets sick and her colds usually last for weeks even though she goes to the doctor and takes whatever they prescribe. She also got bullied at work into getting the vaccine (Moderna). Her reaction was a look of fear and then realization took over. No words. I also asked her if anything Chris said was wrong or competently unhinged and she said: "no, he's right but please don't show this to your brother, don't give him more reasons to not listen." </p>
<p>Overall I thought it was a good experiment and wonder how more people would react to the "nut case conspiracy theories" and "grandma killers" if they would just listen objectively and without any biases. I know that it would at least light a spark in many.</p>

        <p>I showed it to him before I showed them. He was luckily born with a natural need to question everything and speak up when something isn't right.  This has always gotten him into trouble and my mom worries because of it but but she should be thankful she doesn't have a beta sheep for a son.</p>

        <p>forget her “worries”. they’re COMPLETELY irrational. he needs to be made entirely immune to the “worries” of emotionally driven people and behave based on principles, morals and sound reasoning.</p>
<p>good for you and your dad for being an example!</p>
<p>your mother loves all of you dearly, but you must know when to disregard excessive caution.</p>
