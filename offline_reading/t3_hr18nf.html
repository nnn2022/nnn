    <strong>Coping with COVID-19 (including the lockdown) study: we want to hear your experience</strong>
    <p><p>Hello! We are researchers from Rowan University seeking to understand the mental health impact of the pandemic and how individuals are coping. Anyone who is at least 18 years old, English speaking, and a resident of the United States is welcome to take part. This comprehensive survey is anticipated to take between 20 and 40 minutes to complete and participants will be entered into a drawing for a chance to win a $100 Visa card. One out of every 25 participants will be randomly selected to win. Participants will also have the option to be considered to participate in follow-up research that will result in further compensation.</p>

        <p>Hmm. Today both my savings account bank and a completely separate bank I hold a credit card with emailed asking me to “share my covid experience so they may better serve me” or some shit and wanted me to update my income. I know they do that periodically but the approach was weird. </p>
<p>It’s like they’re trying to see how screwed everyone is. Since I truly do not believe TPTB are benevolent, I can only assume they want to make sure we’re screwed ENOUGH...</p>
<p>Or if they need to turn up the heat.</p>

        <p>Hey there, just wanted to clarify if you had any concerns about the purpose of the study. We are interested in exploring how factors associated with the pandemic (loss of job, changes to routine, impact from the virus specifically, etc.) may be related to depression, anxiety, and alcohol use. Data are completely anonymous and will only be presented in aggregate reports submitted to academic journals. You have the option to not include any identifiable information at all and we would have no way to contact you. Let us know if you have any questions.</p>

        <p>Affiliation: Rowan University Health and Behavioral Integrated Treatments (HABIT) Unit</p>
<p>Study Title: Coping with Mental Health Concerns Related to COVID-19</p>
<p>Study Description: We have recently launched a study investigating the mental health consequences during COVID-19 and how individuals have been coping thus far. You will be asked to answer several questions about your experience related to COVID-19, mental health symptoms, and substance use. In addition, you will be asked about the ways in which you have been coping that may help inform treatments for others who are struggling with the psychological impact of the global pandemic. You will be asked to make several hypothetical decisions on survey tasks and we ask you to be as honest as possible in your responses. Anyone who is at least 18 years old, English speaking, and a resident of the United States is welcome to take part. This comprehensive survey is anticipated to take between 20 and 40 minutes to complete. One out of every 25 participants will be selected to win a $100 Visa card. Participants will also have the option to be considered to participate in follow-up research that will result in further compensation.</p>

<li>Allowing any human to die because you refuse to take the most minimum preventive measure is reprehensible. That minimum effort being wearing a mask when you leave the house.</li>
<li>This isn’t entirely about stoping deaths, but the spread in general. When the spread is left unchecked hospitals become overwhelmed.  When hospitals are overwhelmed young people tend to die from COVID 19. They don’t die because the virus was too powerful, but because they couldn’t get proper treatment to manage it from medical professionals.</li>
<li>Other countries have gotten a handle on this thing by taking it seriously. If they can do it, we can do it. So, why aren’t we?</li>

        <p>1: Cool. Do you propose we attempt to eliminate every cause of death? Pursue immortality as a species? People die. People always have died and always will die. Some die young, most die old. Is age reprehensible? Is time reprehensible? Is being a fat fuck who smokes a pack of cigarettes a day reprehensible? Do you believe blood donation should be mandatory too? My blood could save up to 3 lives, so I'm allowing up to 3 people to die by not donating blood.</p>
<p>2: Young and old alike don't actually need hospitalized nearly as much as people seem to think. One of the greatest flaws of our modern medical system is overtreatment, often for financial reasons, and the criteria for hospitalization is quite lax. Many so-called COVID deaths in young people are actually from unnecessarily shoving a plastic tube down into their lungs because hospitals get more money for intubating patients. Nevermind the many other causes of death because hospitals only care about COVID patients, often erroneously reporting these deaths as COVID deaths.</p>
<p>3: Because we don't need to "get a handle" on this virus. We need to get a handle on the mass hysteria and government/corporate overreach perpetuated by the fearmongering media and easily duped little mooks like you. As is often said, it's easier to fool someone than to convince them they've been fooled.</p>

<p>EDIT: That's a sexist assumption. And I like how you change "guy" to "lady", but still haven't changed "him" to "her". I corrected you on my pronouns, not the word "guy" because it's often seen as a more-or-less unisex term.</p>

        <p>So what if I am arrogant. At least I don't blindly trust government entities that have been widely proven wrong on many previous occasions. You need a panel of bureaucrats to think for you, I don't. You don't even know me or care about me to be embarassed or disappointed. You are no less reprehensible or selfish than any other human on this planet. Spare me your sanctimony.</p>

        <p>You’re talking out of your ass. Complaining about the government while praising the dummy in charge. Ever heard of an oxymoron? 
It’s clear you don’t know what doctors do, or why you should listen to scientists with peer reviewed research on the matter. I assume you’re antivax, if not I can’t imagine why you’re being so obtuse. If you are, that pulls everything into place. Be careful of that 5G, ya luddite.</p>

        <p>Not sure where I praised Trump, but okay. He is entertaining, and sometimes he pretends to espouse values aligned with my own, but I hate all government/corporate executives by default. And I know exactly what doctors do: waste time and money on college courses that only serve to narrow their mind, practice medicine out of what is often a genuine desire to help people, but ultimately become little more than shills for the pharmaceuticals they prescribe. And you can call me anti-vax if you want; I oppose mandatory vaccination, but support the right of others to be vaccinated. Aaannd 5G has nothing to do with COVID-19, though it does concern me for other reasons. Have fun being afraid of a bad cold.</p>

<p>It’s called becoming an expert. </p>
<p>You’re desperately in need of more education. The more you learn the more you realize what you don’t know. You think you know a lot which is, frankly, ludicrous.</p>
<p>&rt; Aaannd 5G has nothing to do with COVID-19, though it does concern me for other reasons.</p>
<p>5G stands for 5th generation. It’s the 5th generation of cell phone network.  It brings with it stronger processing power so that our phones and computers will be capable of connecting to the network. That’s all! That’s the whole thing.</p>
<h3>The main advantage of the new networks is that they will have greater bandwidth, giving higher download speeds, eventually up to 10 gigabits per second (Gbit/s).Due to the increased bandwidth, it is expected that the new networks will not just serve cellphones like existing cellular networks, but also be used as general internet service providers for laptops and desktop computers, competing with existing ISPs such as cable internet, and also will make possible new applications in internet of things (IoT) and machine to machine areas.</h3>

        <p>You narrow your field, you narrow your mind.</p>
<p>Not gonna go into detail, but 5G isn't so simple as just stronger processing power. The signal has a shorter range and is more easily blocked by trees or buildings, making it less than ideal for long-range transmission without either removing these obstacles or placing more towers. 5G is indeed good for the IoT, but the IoT is far from a necessary technological advancement. No one needs Alexa or a "smart" refrigerator.</p>
<p>I'm done with you though. By ranting and raving in bold oversized letters like a tantruming child, you lost whatever credibility you had, which wasn't very much to begin with. You're a self-righteous intellectual elitist falling head-over-heels for a media-driven mass hysteria, a virtue-signalling (most likely middle-class) authoritarian fully willing to sacrifice the freedoms and livelihoods of millions to protect a mostly elderly obese minority who are most likely on their way out anyway. I don't really care if you think I'm selfish or arrogant, because you are too. At least I know what I am.</p>
