        <p>They dont seem to call it what it is: Censorship. They know 'freedom of speech' is still a value in the public mind and that the public mind generally still does not agree with 'censorship' so they have introduced this disgusting propaganda term 'fake news', the implication being that all 'fake news' is a priori false. Anyone who thinks knows that 'fake news' is a label that anyone can throw on anything if they want to discredit and silence it. Freedom of speech was never guaranteed on the condition that everyone speak only facts, freedom of speech was always absolute.</p>

        <p>I find this all so troubling. This alongside the revocation of the right to demonstrate is a threat to democracy. Censorship is being encouraged and cheered on. </p>
<p>I’m really in favour of vaccines, they’ve eradicated (in the first world at least) horrible diseases like polio, meningitis, mumps, the list goes on. But we know this vaccine has been rushed to market in record time and it’s a legitimate viewpoint to question whether it’s perfectly safe just because the pharmaceutical giant that developed it says it is. We also know from the Ticketmaster statement that it might be used to deny service to certain people, used to divide people even further. </p>
<p>I’m also nervous about how this affects the anti-lockdown movement. I think the mood will swing more towards anti-vax rather than defending democracy and civil rights. Being this open about censoring them when they actually finally have a valid point will only energise them further, make them more convinced of their conspiracy theories about Bill Gates injecting them with microchips or whatever because they’re just making it look as if they’ve got something to hide. </p>
<p>FWIW I’ll take the vaccine if offered it. I just want it all to stop and to have my life back. I still don’t think it should be forced on people. If they want to risk getting corona in future that’s on them, although I suppose there’s then another question to be answered about their children. If this doesn’t end these asinine restrictions, those who can’t stand them any longer will reach the public majority, even my most pro-lockdown friends are saying that the vaccine should be the end of it. </p>
<p>Just chalk it up to another outrageous misplay by those in positions of power. They ought to be ashamed of their inability to govern or represent their constituents. We’ll look back at this time in a few years with shame and embarrassment.</p>

<p>This is exactly why freedom of speech is so important. If you don't let the cranks make a tit of themselves by silencing them, it lends them credibility.</p>

        <p>I've never felt more out of place as a Labour voter. I was naive enough to assume that in a country such as this we could all agree at least on the basic principles of Liberal democracy: The fundamental freedoms of speech, assembly and association; the right to a private and family life; equality before the law. It seems now that the modern Labour Party is opposed to all these things.</p>

        <p>Modern socialist parties haven't been about "the people" or "the working man" since at least the 60's.</p>
<p>They only care about the "rights" of the vocal minority now - LBGTQ%\^T\^&amp;UHYGTFGYUYu, militant unions, criminals, the work-shy, and POC. The average person, in their eyes, can go hang.</p>
<p>It's all about gaining power and bellying up to the taxpayer trough - by any means at their disposal.</p>
