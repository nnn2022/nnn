<title>California is dumping water into the ocean during a drought. It is supposedly to save fish. It hasn't worked for 30 years but they are keeping at it. 2 years ago there was enough water for every Californian for years. Now it is alarmingly low.</title>

    <strong>California is dumping water into the ocean during a drought. It is supposedly to save fish. It hasn't worked for 30 years but they are keeping at it. 2 years ago there was enough water for every Californian for years. Now it is alarmingly low.</strong>
    <p><p>California is <a href="https://californiaglobe.com/section-2/california-releasing-water-from-reservoirs-claiming-drought-conditions/amp/">dumping water</a></p>
<p>According to the article, </p>
<p>What they don’t say is that the state has been letting water out of reservoirs across California for months now. And it’s not going to farmers, growers, ranchers or urban use. Environmental policy says the water “flows” from reservoirs are necessary to produce a rebound of endangered Delta smelt and Chinook salmon. However, these policies are a failure as neither species have been collected in all of the latest trawling surveys, where they spend several days a month searching in more than 200 spots.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as the reservoir water flows are not saving fish at all, the State of California has known we are heading into a multi year drought. But northern reservoir managers have continued to release water through the Delta, and into the Pacific Ocean anyway.</p>
<p>“Less than two years ago, every reservoir in the state was brimming with water, and held a supply to last a minimum of five dry years without another drop of rain. Shasta and Oroville by themselves held enough water to meet the needs of 80 million people for a year. With 25 million receiving water from these sources, those two reservoirs alone could deliver water for more than three years. But the majority of that stored water has been released to the ocean for ongoing environmental causes that have not benefitted a single endangered fish. Water managers claim the problem is families are not conserving enough. They are now recommending only using water for drinking and sanitation, and to stop watering any landscape that is not edible. Many property owners are already trucking in water.”</p></p>

        <p>This has been happening since Jerry Brown was governor. When Trump finally gave the Central Valley its water Gavin Newsom sued and got it locked into Environmental science limbo. So until science says it’s ok, no water for the farmers.  Criminal</p>

        <p>How exactly would dumping water in the ocean save fish? And if they're so concerned about the extinction of certain fish, maybe they should put a limit on fish consumption and fishing. Or just ban fishing for those species. Seems a lot more effective than dumping water in the ocean, putting the people and animals of California in danger. Idk the full story though.</p>
