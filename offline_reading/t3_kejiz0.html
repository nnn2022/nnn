    <strong>I’m never going to be anything more than a poor incel due to this shit - advice on coping?</strong>
    <p><p>So I just turned 24. Even before lockdowns, my life was pretty shit: I had no friends, no girls were interested in me, my parents were overprotective, &amp; I wasn’t popular on social media. Everyone used me for homework answers, or to do their work for them. I could never go to parties except family functions. The only thing I had going for me was the fact that I was a good student (graduated from university with a finance degree) &amp; that I saved whatever money I did get, so I’ve always been debt-free (unless you consider our currency as debt, which is another rabbit-hole, but still). I live in Toronto. Right now, thanks to this shit, I have no social, romantic, or financial prospects, &amp; I won’t be having them anytime soon. My parents, &amp; everyone around me, is a doomer. I’m literally angry all the time to the point where I’m worried I might become violent. And I can’t even express how angry I am to them because they panic every time I express something other than happiness or being fine. I’m sick of fucking being lonely all the time. And I feel like this is NEVER going to change because lockdowns are never going to end. Unlike most of you, I’ll never be able to find the love of my life, friends I get along with, or even a well-paying job. Everybody that I’ve met is so fucking flaky it’s unreal, just because I’m not popular on the gram. And I can’t go out &amp; do anything because again, my parents are doomers, they’d find out, I’d have to go through all that shit. I want to run away, but I don’t even have the basic skills to take care of myself most of the time, &amp; with the way landlords are around here, I’d probably be walking into a worse situation than my current one. It’s basically trading intense pain with comfort for intense pain with no comfort. I’ve also been kicked out of a few internet groups that could’ve helped me because I lashed out when I was feeling frustrated.</p>
<p>I’m never going to be able to feel the hug of a friend, the kiss of a girl who loves me, respect, any of that shit ever again. And given the way the world is going, none of that shit will even matter, because I’m worried I’ll be fighting for my life against angry hordes of programmed NPCs going forward if I deviate even one iota from the MSM narrative in my beliefs.</p>
<p>How do I cope with the fact that I’ll be an incel soldier in an unwinnable war for the rest of my life, &amp; that I’ll never be able to level up socially, romantically, or financially because TPTB &amp; their programmed minions (99.9% of the population) are all against me, &amp; have been since the beginning of time? How do I cope with the fact that any prospect of me indulging in the things that have brought happiness to billions of others has completely vanished, never to return, thanks to the “Great Reset?” How do I cope with the fact that all of my former life goals are completely unattainable, &amp; I’ll miss out permanently on a part of life that the vast majority of my peers got to experience 5-10 years ago? I feel like the world was robbed from me &amp; everybody’s been conspiring against me since birth to bring me as much misery as possible. It’s not fucking fair. Therapy ain’t helping.</p></p>
