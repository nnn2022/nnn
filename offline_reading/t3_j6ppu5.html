    <strong>The COVID era is very similar to the post 9/11 War on Terror era.</strong>
    <p><ul>
<li>Governments using it as an excuse to violate of basic freedom and civil liberties.  After 9/11 we got the TSA, NSA, and the patriot ACT.  With COVID businesses are being forced to close.</li>
<li>Constant fear mongering by media and politicians.  Often being over exaggerated to defend past actions.  The war on terror constantly reminded us about a potential new terrorist attacks  while with COVID it's always focused on the next outbreak.</li>
<li>Certain industries making trillions of dollars off government stimulus, spending, and policy.  War on Terror it was the Military industrial complex, with COVID it's Amazon.</li>
<li>Name calling and attacks from anyone challenging the narrative and current course of action by the government.</li>
<li>Failing to address secondary consequences created by implementing wars in the middle east and lockdowns. The wars in the middle east killed thousands of civilians and our own troops. Many regions occupied by the US created more violence and often destabilized it making it more violent.  Lockdowns are killing jobs permanently and are taking a giant toll on mental health.  These effects are rarely talked about and the long term implications could be much worse.</li>
<li>At the end of the day, nothing got better.  Terrorism continued after 9/11 and the middle east is still dealing the armed conflicts.  Lockdowns might have slowed the spread temporary, but even the most locked down countries and states are seeing rising cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>The new normal after 9/11 gave us mass surveillance justified by the constant threat of terrorism.  Now we are constantly worried our government will shut down our livelihoods because of threats of new outbreaks.</p></p>

        <p>Well taking your shoes off at the airport is such a tiny thing most people don’t think about it. A lot of countries don’t do that, and in America most Americans don’t fly very often. Wearing masks all day every day will make people mad.</p>

        <p>Maybe they <em>should</em> think about it. Aside from my dad's friend's little Cessna, I've never flown a day in my life. Primarily because I want nothing to do with airport security. My mom got free plane tickets to California back when I was in high school, to which I absolutely refused because of the body scanners and TSA groping. Any dreams I had to travel the world ended at a very young age because, even then, I knew what 9/11 meant for the future of liberty and privacy. I'm an outlier though, most people don't give a fuck if their bags go through x-ray vision or if a TSA agent is jacking off to them.</p>

        <p>Bro, don't let the TSA prevent you from traveling.  The TSA is a huge pain in the ass, but traveling is a worthwhile experience. Also most travel over 500 miles is simply miserable by car.  I once did a 11 hour car ride because I used to be afraid of flying (heights) and all I could think about was the simple hour and a half flight it would have taken.  TSA sucks for sure but flying is still worth it.</p>

<p>Oh, one 9/11 similarity people don't notice - the creation of a special "hero class" to be elevated and showered with unearned affection.  Back then, it was soldiers and cops.  Now, it's doctors and nurses (and other arbitrarily-essential workers, to a lesser degree).</p>

        <p>Very good point.  I remember that shit.  It literally never went down to the safer levels.  It always remained high.  Sometimes they would lower it to neutral, but only to raise it back up again.  Damn talk about literal fear mongering.</p>

        <p>Back in March I was saying this to my 34-yo daughter (who lived through the Iraq War thing, even went with us to the big march against the war in Philadelphia).  I said "this feels exactly like the ubiquitous propaganda we had then. I don't know why they're doing it but I definitely feel like we're getting played. Again."</p>
<p>She was all for lockdowns and couldn't understand why I would have civil liberties concerns and said "you can't argue with a virus."  Well shit, I'm not arguing with a virus, I'm arguing with the <em>government</em> and the <em>propaganda</em>.</p>
<p>The Big Lie technique works. No one is willing to entertain the idea that big players in the government get the enthusiastic help of virtually every media outlet to spread an agenda of deception and fear, all of it lies.  Exactly what happened in 2003! But never mind that, it's a virus, don't you know. Completely different.</p>

        <p>With your Fox News regurgitation, you're spreading "an agenda of deception and fear, all of it lies." Not an iota of self-awareness. You're a deranged and delusional old man, a boomer.

        <p>I agree, and then some. Few touch on the invasions of personal privacy resulting from test-and-trace programs, everyone focuses on mask mandates and business shutdowns because those are the most visible threats. We stand to lose much more than small businesses though. This here War On COVID is much worse than the War On Terror ever could be. And it isn't just about mUh RiGhTs, it's about everyone's rights.

        <p>lol. The fact that terrorism is man made is a weak argument. You could easily make an argument just as strong for COVID’s new normal-probably a stronger case. Ultimately these “new normals” though are based on dogma and are thin veils for an increasingly totalitarian way of life.</p>

        <p>Yes, terrorism is a human action. And the real terrorists are our government officials and corporate executives who manufacture or otherwise take advantage of crises to "'justify" further consolidation of their power.</p>
