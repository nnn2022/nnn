    <strong>my experience with Employer asking Vaccine status</strong>
    <p><p>In my state of WA, the Labor department recently put out new Workplace Requirements, stating that employers can lift mask mandates, as long as they collect Vaccination status</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lni.wa.gov/forms-publications/F414-164-000.pdf">https://www.lni.wa.gov/forms-publications/F414-164-000.pdf</a></p>
<p>We were all emailed a mandatory survey, of which one of the options was "I decline to disclose my vaccination status". However in the email they also stated </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; If you decline to provide information about your vaccination status, COMPANY will be required to assume you are not fully vaccinated and/or unvaccinated for the purposes of this mandate, and you will be required to wear a mask and follow social distance guidelines while at work. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Today the company announced anyone who provided a "Fully Vaccinated" status was allowed to take their masks off, and I would say about 80% of the coworkers took their masks off. Of course nobody wants to wear a mask all day in front of a computer.</p>
<p>Company and boss were both on my ass to answer the survey, so after the meeting I did and selected the "Decline to disclose status" option. </p>
<p>I spoke to my boss in private, saying I would not disclose my status. He was surprisingly cool about it, said he did not care personally, but that I would have to follow the mandate and keep my mask on.</p>
<p>From everything I can tell this is definitely an othering tactic. There was a sigh of relief from the people who unmasked, while I am now one of the \~20% who still has to wear a mask at the office. It definitely feels off and like I am out of place. I am not even sure if the other people who have masks on are doing it out of caution, or they are in the same boat as me.</p>
<p>I just wanted to put my experience out here, and say that from my experience killing them with kindness has been a good approach. I still Chin Diaper my mask most of the day as whatever silent protest I can do, but I am also aware that freaking out about this will only polarize everyone.</p>
<p>Unity is the way forward in my opinion. Nobody at the office actually even really cares about Coronavirus anymore, they just have to follow whatever rules the State and their bosses tell them. I hope to see a breakdown in this fear of power, where everyday people let things slide, because the rules are so absurd.</p>
<p>Please share your own experiences, if you are comfortable, as I believe there are a lot of us Objectors who are suffering in silence. Cheers.</p></p>

        <p>I am looking forward to the reaction when fully vaccinated places of employment with this policy start having outbreaks. Will be very interesting since they can’t blame anti-maskers and unvaccinated people.</p>

        <p>Don't kid yourself, if there's one thing we've all learned in the last few weeks alone is that there will always be some mental gymnastics people will hurl themselves through to place blame on others for things they are light years away from understanding.</p>

        <p>I’m in WA state as well. My employer had a slightly different approach. They sent out a letter. Anyone who could provide proof of being fully vaccinated is given a red pin with a “V” on it to wear and do not have to wear a mask. </p>
<p>There are only 4 of us in my department who are not getting vaccinated. We complied and wore masks for the first couple weeks. It was so depressing and stressful. We felt singled out and other employees would tell on us if they saw us without a mask on. It was terrible. </p>
<p>But there is light at the end of the tunnel... Now that it’s been more than a couple weeks everyone has pretty much forgotten about it. No one masks up unless someone from corporate who knows our vaccine status is around. No one tells on anyone and it feels almost normal.</p>

        <p>this is good news to hear, stay strong brother. I got the vibe that nobody gives a shit about this anymore, it's all to appeal to their Boss or the State</p>
<p>Masks are temporary, vaccines are permanent.</p>

        <p>I’m worried about my son going to college. They want to know statuses and require masks if unvaxed. How will that even work in the dorms? With a roommate? He doesnt want to be singled out but definitely doesn’t want to be vaxed as we all already had covid. The school wrote on their website proof of immunity will still require masks since they don’t know how long immunity lasts. They also don’t know how long the vax will last but that seems a.o.k. To them. <br>
Will teachers look down on students who don’t vaccinate? Will they have a list to see if the right students are wearing masks? His only consolation is seeing other masked students mean theyre probably on the same page with this issue</p>

        <p>I’m in WA, too, and my company did the same. They’re not requiring us to disclose either way, they just put it out that if you want to remove your mask, then provide HR with the documentation and you’re good. </p>
<p>I’m one of the few (slightly more than your experience- say, 35-40% are still masking) who will keep my mask on, though not vaxxed.</p>

        <p>If your boss is chill, maybe just... slowly one day take it off and if anyone asks, just say you've been vaccinated now. unless they're your boss or above, they won't ask for proof. it's a risky move to say this to someone higher up, but just act confident in case it does happen. "oh i left it at home hahaha." it's what i did lolol</p>
