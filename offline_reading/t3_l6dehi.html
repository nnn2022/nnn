    <strong>Doomers ask for proof...you give them links and they ghost you?</strong>
    <p><p>Has anyone noticed that when arguing with doomers on this sub, they bark at you for links, sources, and proof of what you're saying...then when you literally post your links they never respond again?</p></p>

        <p>It's easy to throw links around. Arguing science is not the way.</p>
<p>Simply put there is no justification for what is being done to us by the government. It was a complete mismanagement from the start and they have done little to nothing to earn back trust and continue with draconian restrictions and mandates.</p>
<p>Its pretty clear that they have absolutely no concern for the American public, only petty political rivalries and power. So it doesn't matter what the science says we should do, because we have absolutely no way of achieving its goals under our "leadership".</p>

        <p>Yes in the beginning I provided massive amounts of studies and "peer reviewed" data and was called a "pseudo intellectual". I even had a ready to go wall I would copy and paste because I accumulated so much at one point. Some troll that follows me addressed that I did that but was banned before I could even respond to acknowledge that yes I sifted through all of those studies in great detail over the last 10months because well, what else am I supposed to do when the "authorities" lock everything down and prevent me from leaving my home? Whenever I did post it some doomers were like "Your first study from the NEJM has an editors note..."  </p>
<p>I'm like, "Uh, so? It's clarifying their position on masks because even though it's a pro mask article all the evidence and points they made didn't give a good impression on the effectiveness of masks, stop acting like it's a redaction, smh." </p>
<p>The rest of the links they didn't even bother to touch and they would either resort to ad hominem attacks or end the conversation all together. Another tactic is tag teaming, where one doomer will ask for studies, ghost you and another would attack you in the various ways we've all seen, smdh (hard eye roll).  I had one criticize one of my post because in the comments I failed to keep the humorous sarcastic irony in the OP....like really? WTF? I can address people's comments however I like, it's my fucking post, JC!</p>

<p>From <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372?fbclid=IwAR0ULN8J0yuwpkr5Fzn6iJQsVsAFkYFuy_-0I7WX_38I02TRcf1NmlHcRj8">New England Journal of Medicine</a> :</p>
<p>"<em>We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers</em> <strong><em>little, if any, protection from infection</em></strong>. <em>Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes).</em> <strong><em>The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal</em></strong>*. <em>In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic."</em></p>
<p>Fauci said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZcTqW1Ngj4">that mask may help someone "feel better" but don't do much</a> .</p>
<p>Also from the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/transmission-of-sars-cov-2-implications-for-infection-prevention-precautions#:~:text=Airborne%20transmission%20is%20defined%20as,long%20distances%20and%20time">WHO</a> :</p>
<p>"<em>The physics of exhaled air and flow physics have generated</em> <strong><em>hypotheses about possible mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through aerosols</em></strong>*.(13-16) These* <strong><em>theories</em></strong> <strong><em>suggest</em></strong> <em>that 1) a number of respiratory droplets generate microscopic aerosols (&lt;5 µm) by evaporating, and 2) normal breathing and talking results in exhaled aerosols. Thus, a susceptible person could inhale aerosols, and could become infected if the aerosols contain the virus in sufficient quantity to cause infection within the recipient. However, the proportion of exhaled droplet nuclei or of respiratory droplets that evaporate to generate aerosols, and the infectious dose of viable SARS-CoV-2  required to cause infection in another person are</em> <strong><em>not known</em></strong>*, <em>but it has been studied for other respiratory viruses.(17)"</em></p>
<p>Additional studies confirming the same thing:</p>
<ol>
<li>A randomized controlled trial by the<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029744"> University of Michigan-School of Public Health</a> found hand washing reduced influenza-like illnesses; while mask wearing made no difference whatsoever.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-12-26">German randomized controlled trial</a> found “there was no statistically significant effect” when it came to wearing masks “on secondary infections.”</li>
<li>A 2010 randomized study in the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/201/4/491/861190">The Journal of Infectious Diseases </a>found that neither “face mask use and hand hygiene nor face mask use alone was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of influenza-like illnesses cumulatively.”</li>
<li>A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00205.x">randomized controlled trial conducted in Thailand</a> during the H1N1 pandemic found “Influenza transmission was not reduced by interventions to promote hand washing and face mask use.”</li>
<li>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/003335491012500206">19-month randomized controlled trial</a> of crowded urban households found a significant reduction in upper respiratory infection through educational interventions; but no reduction when adding hand sanitizers or masks.</li>
<li>A randomized controlled trial of people sleeping together in tents during an Islamic pilgrimage was reported in <a href="https://www.eurekaselect.com/125489/article">Infectious Disorders</a>. Researchers found no difference in laboratory confirmed influenza cases among those wearing masks and those who were not. </li>
<li>A <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013998">randomized trial in France</a> found that mask wearing only produced a 0.4% reduction in secondary infection and “did not identify any trend in the results suggesting effectiveness of facemasks.”</li>

        <p>It's not really a question of IF masks work but how much. COVID is spread through aerosols and attach to your spit or mucus. Masks help keep your spit to yourself but unless your wearing a medical mask it's not stopping others from spitting on you.</p>

        <p>These studies involve mask use to prevent infections among people living together, mostly secondary infections within households.  Several indicated that there was a reduction in secondary infections through the use of both hand hygiene and masks, but not necessarily masks alone, which makes sense in the context of spreading the flu in a household.</p>

        <p>The problem is that face masks are going to be more effective at preventing you spreading the virus to other people than preventing you catching it yourself, that's why everyone is being told to wear masks. </p>
<p>The problem with a lot of these papers as well is that although they are using a pretty high starting sample size, you still have a low rate of ILI throughout that population so it's hard to get good statistical power, in the first study only 34 cases were positively identified. 
Even fewer in the 4th.</p>
<p>A large scale meta-analysis looking at the body of literature said:</p>
<p>&rt;We did not identify any experimental volunteer studies that investigated whether surgical masks or N95 respirators could protect against infection. </p>
<p>So there is a lack of well designed experimental studies.</p>
<p>However they identify one paper that is more experimental.</p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19522650/</p>
<p>&rt;We identified one experimental study of face mask performance which involved participants with confirmed influenza virus infection [7], and the results suggested that surgical masks may be able to reduce infectiousness.</p>
<p>And there has been this more recently and focusing on coronaviruses.</p>
<p>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0843-2</p>
<p>&rt;Surgical face masks significantly reduced detection of influenza virus RNA in respiratory droplets and coronavirus RNA in aerosols, with a trend toward reduced detection of coronavirus RNA in respiratory droplets. Our results indicate that surgical face masks could prevent transmission of human coronaviruses and influenza viruses from symptomatic individuals.</p>
<p>And when you get the very large scale epidemiological studies there seems to be a body of evidence developing to support mask wearing to reduce transmission. Although here is only a small selection of them. </p>
<p>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.22.20109231v5</p>
<p>&rt;Societal norms and government policies supporting the wearing of masks by the public, as well as international travel controls, are independently associated with lower per-capita mortality from COVID-19.</p>
<p>https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00818</p>
<p>&rt;The findings suggest that requiring face mask use in public could help in mitigating the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(21)00003-0/fulltext
&rt;For preventing transmission, non-targeted interventions, such as face masks, are especially important given the high proportion of asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic cases and the risk of transmission from these individuals, and from the presymptomatic period.</p>
<p>https://www.pnas.org/content/117/51/32293</p>
<p>&rt;Weighing various estimates, we conclude that 20 d after becoming mandatory face masks have reduced the number of new infections by around 45%</p>
<p>https://www.pnas.org/content/118/4/e2014564118</p>
<p>&rt;Our review of the literature offers evidence in favor of widespread mask use as source control to reduce community transmission: Nonmedical masks use materials that obstruct particles of the necessary size; people are most infectious in the initial period postinfection, where it is common to have few or no symptoms (45, 46, 141); nonmedical masks have been effective in reducing transmission of respiratory viruses; and places and time periods where mask usage is required or widespread have shown substantially lower community transmission.</p>
<p>These studies have a lot of limitations on their own, but together the evidence seems to be pointing in one direction.</p>
<p>&rt;You give them links and they ghost you</p>
<p>As I was saying, it's just as much the case the other way round.</p>

        <p>A lot of their arguments can't really be peer-reviewed, but they'll use peer-reviewed data to make an unrelated conclusion. If you explain this to them, they'll ask for peer-reviewed data that makes your argument. </p>
<p>For example: the claim "BLM protests didn't impact the spread of the virus. This is because they wore masks"</p>
<p>To support this, they'll show you a peer-reviewed article (at least the one I got last time) that says they haven't been able to find conclusive evidence about how much protection masks can provide against covid. But surgical masks can block up to 80% of virus particles from some other coronavirus, and cloth masks are like 60% effective. Can't remember exactly.  But based on this, wearing cloth masks is better than nothing.</p>
<p>From here, they'll conclude that because some protesters, wore masks, a spike in cases is impossible. The data does not support the claim. You would have to ignore the fact that they were close together, not all of them wore masks, they were sweating because it was summer and that they were yelling. It also isn't a calm environment where no one would be adjusting their masks. It also assumes that all you have to do to not spread the virus is have SOME people wearing masks. And we know from there own data this isn't true. And based on their arguments on other topics, we know they don't think this is true. </p>
<p>So then when they want you to produce data that supports your side, you really can't. The problem isn' t that you have no data, it's that they drew an obviously incorrect conclusion from data they don't understand and are asking for peer-reviewed data that refutes the nonsense that they made up.</p>

        <p>Maybe they actually read the stuff, and realized they were being brainwashed, and instead of admitting it, they go away because I think a part of these people's problem is that they don't like to be wrong. Very emotional in a childish way like a Narc. Might be.</p>

        <p>Millions, actually. About 2,400,000 worldwide by the count of the WHO.</p>
<p>Of course this ignores that China and India (almost 3 billion people combined) have clearly unreliable tracking. It also ignores that basically every jurisdiction is counting a person who dies within some arbitrary time after a positive lab test a covid death. These put together probably roughly cancel out but if there's an adjustment to be made it's slightly up. Let's say 3 million deaths worldwide as an educated guess.</p>
<p>During an awful global pandemic the world population increased by twice as much as that. https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/</p>
<p>So yeah. Not all that dangerous in context. If you're not old and take decent care of your body it's a non-event.</p>
