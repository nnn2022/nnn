        <p>I've actually seen how they fake that number personally personally. So, back in August, I had to take a covid test for work. The test came back inconclusive, so I was asked to come to a local hospital where they had set up a more sterile environment they said. I go in, and I am directed to a waiting room That I was stuck in for 45 minutes to an hour. After they performed the test, I was given a packet of papers that they said would take care of everything. When I read through the papers, something that jumped out at me was  Where it said essentially "since you have been confined in a medical facility at the request of a doctor for a situation relating to covid 19, you are considered to have been hospitalized for covid"</p>

<p>there were 880k cases total, per the cdc.  so pretty obvious they are confusing cases w/ hospitalizations.  they also don't show where they actually sourced their info and give approximate values.</p>

        <p>The AP is picked up by newspapers throughout the US and the headlines regurgitated.</p>
<p>They never retract anything either.</p>
