    <strong>Mask mandates are spreading...</strong>
    <p><p>The death rate doesn't even come close to warranting widespread lockdowns or mandates of any kind. Intentionally manipulated and exaggerated statistics are nothing more than fear porn to keep people subservient to an agenda and ignorant of factual evidence. A 0.26% death rate, or anything remotely close, means that the elderly, those around them frequently, and people with pre existing conditions should be taking precautions, while the rest of us should be going about our normal lives. Unless there is no such thing as naturally developed immunity, shouldn't we be encouraging young people to be out and about in order to develop widespread immunity?</p>
<p>That being said, I will be forced to fly for work within the next month. Airlines are mandating masks (hilariously stupid when you consider that no one is trained to use them safely, they are made of random cloth with no consistency, and we're all on a giant metal tube breathing recycled air).</p>
<p>I know that I use a P95 organic vapor mask for painting, and a P100 mask for sawdust. Anything less will not protect me from these particles. How the ever living f*** is a cloth from your grandma going to provide any protection against virus particles that are much, much smaller? Mask mandates are idiotic and Orwellian, and I fear that these mandates are conditioning people to blindly accept a vaccine and further authoritarian control measures, while garnering widespread support to demonize and attack anyone who speaks up or refuses to go along.</p>
<p>People will claim droplet protocol and masks are to protect others not yourself, but it's pretty ridiculous to think a various, bandied assortment of homemade cloth masks is saving lives, and I'm an asshole who is recklessly killing people if I even question an authoritarian government mandate.</p>
<p>I feel as though civil disobedience is absolutely necessary right now. I fully encourage those who feel at risk to purchase and wear a mask that will ACTUALLY offer them protection from breathing in airborne contaminants. That is their right, just as it is mine to not be subjected to tyranny in the form of irrational mandates poorly supported by pseudoscience.</p>
<p>I also don't want to be unnecessarily inflammatory, cause a public scene, or be subject to a coordinated social justice warrior attack.</p>
<p>But still, I feel as though when I'm on a plane and required to wear a mask by official mandate to travel to my workplace, I must at least publicly demonstrate my absolute disgust for the current state of complacency and blind acceptance.</p>
<p>Do I wear a "this mask is useless" mask? It would feel thoroughly ironic, but slightly satisfying that I'm at least making a public statement. Do I refuse to wear one and risk being thrown off, arrested, or worse? Do I wear something that covers my mouth and nose but is something ludicrous and obviously not functional as a mask to make a statement?</p>
<p>I welcome any and all input. I feel as though the time is rapidly approaching when those who value freedom can no longer remain silent.</p></p>

        <p>Bring a mask, wear it when airport personnel ask you to, make sure plane takes off, take out a bag of trail mix or other snack, and a drink. Take off your mask. Anyone asks, say I’m eating/drinking, take a sip or a bite. </p>
<p>Be careful with flying though, don’t be confrontational, play dumb.</p>

        <p>I did it an amusement park last week. I bought the refillable souvenir cup and just sipped on it all day. The security guard who told me to put my mask on even apologized when he realized I was drinking and didn't notice initially. It was awesome lmao</p>

        <p>I don't care either way I would never tell a customer to wear a mask I'd let my manager do it if they cared. Nazis and Germans were "just following orders" too. Today it's a mask, tomorrow it's reporting us to virus police and sent away to a camp. These people will just keep doing what they're told until we wind up dead for not complying. Do you even know history ? Thats where this is headed if we don't Start calling out the bullshit every chance we get</p>

        <p>Yeah retail employees working during covid and nazi soldiers are comparable. I understand that "just following orders" is wrong, but the business owners hardly even have a choice. Do they take a stand and hope it works or stay quiet and lose their business and all their employees lose their job. If you don't like the company policy, don't go there.</p>

        <p>Go about your airport and flying experience as you normally would. If TSA, airport, or airline employees ask you to wear a mask, politely tell them you have a medical reason for not wearing one. This only works if you actually believe you have a medical reason for not wearing one, which you should, because masks reduce oxygen and increase the risk of infection.</p>

        <p>I’m uncomfortable with mask mandates. I’m OK with governors encouraging masks and realize that businesses can do whatever they want, but I don’t like the one size fits all state mandates. It’s too much overreach. At least if it were encouraged I could choose to support businesses who weren’t requiring them. I also don’t think it’s necessary for people without symptoms and aren’t high risk to have to wear them everywhere. </p>
<p>That said, one thing I won’t do is argue with a store employee about it. I’ve worked with the public before and I know how awful people can be (not just a little cranky or stressed, but downright rude and yelling). I actually just left a group today on Facebook because a group member posted how she argued with her stylist in PA because the stylist told her she couldn’t come in without a mask, and the customer was refusing because “it’s not a law.” But the customer believed she was in the right. Well, no, but it is an order and your stylist could get in deep shit for giving you service without a mask. These businesses have been through enough. I don’t want to make their life hard.</p>
<p>That said, if I’m at an outdoor business (like getting ice cream), I don’t put my mask on until it’s almost my turn at the window. No way will I stand in a long line in 80 degree-plus temperatures wearing a mask. I feel that’s fair, since I would still be served without the employee knowing I didn’t have a mask on in a long line.</p>

<p>This.  Strongly encouraged is one thing.  Mandates are something entirely different.  Don't tell me how to virtue signal.</p>

        <p>Here in Arizona masks became mandatory in most areas which is ridiculous, however it is what it is.   I just make the most minimal effort possible to comply.  I keep my mask real low under my nose and just above my upper lip so I can breathe.  I've seen plenty of other people including store employees doing this so not everyone has swallowed the kool aid.  If it's a long visit, I just move it down under my chin so I can take a looooooong drink of water.   It's hot in AZ and no one can prevent you from staying hydrated.</p>
