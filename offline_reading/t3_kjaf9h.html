        <p>Actually when you look at terms of herd immunity, some doctors use the wording "some herd immunity" but what i read on it the ideal herd immunity is when r0 is 1 or lower, that means the virus will kill itself over time. That means if you do get an outbreak it won't escalate. Im not sure why you are saying noro virus is different, in terms of herd immunity the spread is what matters. Noro virus is unpleasant but its almost never deadly or provide any lasting after effect. So yeah even if you get an outbreak and it spreads it is unpleasant. Noro virus immunity lasts for about 6 month. Compare to corona which has killed 1.74 millions, and that is with extreme measures to contain the disease. That is not taking into account long lasting effects which is a worry among medical experts since there are people why still suffer from the disease 9 month after they got sick. How long lasting corona immunity last for is unknown, but there are people who already got sick twice from it. Letting the disease spread naturally without measures the r0 was at about 3 - 4 initially before lockdown in March. Allowing for natural spread would not remove corona completely, and considering how little we know about it and how deadly it is for people who are in risk like elderly I think it is at least ethical to vaccine part of the society. It would give us an immunity same as natural immunity and we could at least let the r0 drop naturally due to some immunity. Comparing it to the flu, we do vaccinate elderly for that, corona however is much more deadly and there is 0 natural immunity which means every elderly could potentially get very sick.</p>

        <p>Okay ill try again.</p>
<p>&rt;Noro virus can't be compared to a respiratory virus.</p>
<p>No viruses can be compared, even among respiratory viruses cannot be compared. Also just because it attacks the respiratory system doesnt mean it doesn't attack anything else either.</p>
<p>&rt;The common cold actually consists of many different viruses. </p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>&rt;Herd immunity usually doesn't mean never getting sick. </p>
<p>More like an equilibrium where much of the population has immunity and it protects most of the rest of the population.
I know, its term used on how to reduce spread of a virus, potentially make it dissappear all together.</p>
<p>&rt;Take the other human coronaviruses for example. They also kill people.every year. They would kill a lot more but.a certain amount of us have immunity from them at any given time so most of us are protected. </p>
<p>Comparing sars-cov-2 and common cold corona viruses to each other is pointless, they result in two completely different diseases not even comparable. Common cold attack the upper respiratory system, covid19 attack the lungs, cardiovascular system, guts and nervous system as we know of. Also fatality rate is 1000 of times higher for covid19 than with common cold, its a batch of different diseases people get all the time many times a year without dying from, even the corona common cold is quite common and they almost never kill people, so no!</p>
<p>&rt;That's what will happen with this virus. It will never go away completely and never be stopped from killing people. Even with a vaccine. Hopefully it will mutate to a less virulent strain as viruses tend to do.</p>
<p>For the same reason weak people vaccinate against influenza even if its still here, people should vaccinate against corona. so wait for the vaccine before we let a novel virus which there exist 0 immunity for go rampant.</p>

        <p>That's not a clarification, they literally just removed the part where it says previous infections can count as herd immunity lmao. Keep shilling though, you are doing a great job, maybe you actually convinced some idiots</p>

        <p>&rt;by intentionally spreading the disease.</p>
<p>You mean like a vaccine? The only real difference being that with the vaccine you are selectively administering very specific segments or weakened/inactive contagions in order to achieve the same response that one would have through normal/natural exposure to a contagion. Herd immunity will be achieved either way, vaccines are just potentially less dangerous than incidental exposure to said contagions for vulnerable individuals, due to viral load.</p>
