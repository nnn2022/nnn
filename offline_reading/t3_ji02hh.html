    <strong>Once they take our freedoms away, they won't give them back without a fight.</strong>
    <p><p>People wonder why I don't trust the government, just look at recent history. The rights we lost after 9/11 never came back. After we killed Bin Laden, they didn't repeal the Patriot Act and let us be able to meet our friends/family at the gate at the airport again. We can debate how much of it is pre-planned and how much is just the end result of many decisions made by greed, fear, and arrogance, but either way there's been a clear trend. Over time, the nanny state has used fear to take away more and more of our rights. People can say any one think isn't that big a deal, "It's just a mask", but the end result of this madness would lead to a dystopian future as in this satirical piece I wrote a few months back,</p>

<p>I don't think it would ever actually get that far, the system will likely collapse for other reasons before then, but things could still get quite dystopian unless there's massive resistance.</p></p>
