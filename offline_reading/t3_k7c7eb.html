<title>What does the Pfizer COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 contain? Only now beginning to dig, so any help you can provide would be appreciated. My main argument is still that mRNA vaccines will change us genetically in ways we cannot know or predict, but it would be helpful to know more about specifics.</title>

    <p><p>What I find most shocking (and yet painfully predictable) is that the MSM is completely ignoring the transhumanist reality of mRNA vaccines. Genes will be affected. Will we be GMOs once we’ve had the jabs? Does any reportedly simian modifications potentially nullify basic human rights? Will we - or the survivors at least - still be human? Will this vaccine be like the flu jab, increasing transmission from the vaccinated to the unvaccinated?</p>
<p>Perhaps most concerning, with the deplorable track record of Pharma and the MSM with the truth, can we trust them to be honest about the real ingredients and effects of this new vaccine? Don‘t let the sounds of raucous public celebration drown out the inner voice telling us something is very wrong here</p>
<p>The MSM continues to treat us as kids, with appeals to fearful emotion, resorting to sketchy anecdotes and with promises of liberation/ parole/ release from our artificially induced captivity. No science to be seen in its presentation of this miracle cure. It’s been rushed to market, steps have been skipped, laws have been bypassed and all under the auspices of “emergency powers” governments have tyrannically granted themselves.</p>
<p>Do not take the vaccine. The burden of proof of safety and effectiveness is on Pharma. It’s not up to us to prove it’s neither. Only overwhelming evidence from previous incarnations to go on here...</p>

<p>So no formaldehyde, alumin(i)um or MRC-5?</p>
<p>From the vaccine insert:</p>
<p>“What COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 contains</p>
<p> The active substance is BNT162b2 RNA.</p>
<p>After dilution, the vial contains 5 doses, of 0.3 mL with 30 micrograms mRNA each.</p>
<p> The other ingredients are:</p>
<p>- ALC-0315 = (4-hydroxybutyl)azanediyl)bis(hexane-6,1-diyl)bis(2-hexyldecanoate),</p>
<p>- ALC-0159 = 2[(polyethylene glycol)-2000]-N,N-ditetradecylacetamide,</p>
<p>- 1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine,</p>
<p>- cholesterol,</p>
<p>- potassium chloride,</p>
<p>- potassium dihydrogen phosphate,</p>
<p>- sodium chloride,</p>
<p>- disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate,</p>
<p>- sucrose”</p>
<p>Due to side effects having to have been experienced as a result of the testing of the vaccine, these are the meagre short-term results of the trials. What the long-term adverse effects might be is anyone’s guess (since long-term testing simply has not occurred, or at least published.)</p>
<p>“Side effects may occur with following frequencies: Very common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people</p>
<p> pain at injection site</p>
<p> tiredness</p>
<p> headache</p>
<p> muscle pain</p>
<p> chills</p>
<p> joint pain</p>
<p> fever</p>
<p>Common: may affect up to 1 in 10 people</p>
<p> injection site swelling</p>
<p> redness at injection site</p>
<p> nausea</p>
<p>Uncommon: may affect up to 1 in 100 people</p>
<p> enlarged lymph nodes</p>
<p> feeling unwell”</p></p>

        <p>While being concerned about the safety of the vaccine based on the speed at which it was developed, the mRNA vaccine is not going to change you "genetically."</p>
<p>&rt;appeals to fearful emotion,</p>
<p>Claiming that it is going to nullify your human rights is, ironically, exactly this. It's almost as if you <em>know</em> this is your tactic and projecting this onto any opposition to your empty claims.</p>

        <p>To that point, those would be DNA vaccine's that do that would it not? And to my knowledge zero DNA vaccine's have been approved for use in the USA for that very reason. I've done my research on mRNA tech, the way it works is so simple, and depending on the ingredients list (it's just salts for PH balance and fats for the mRNA sequence to bind to from what I can breakdown) I'll be taking this when available. I'm not on the anti-vax wagon but there's a few vaccines I will not take, nor my children, based on their current formulations. A flu vaccine,however, based on this makes a TON more sense to me. I, as always, encourage everyone to research and come to their own conclusions and find what works for them.</p>
