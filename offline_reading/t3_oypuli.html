    <strong>Healthcare Workers for Medical Freedom</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.healthcareworkersformedicalfreedom.com/">https://www.healthcareworkersformedicalfreedom.com/</a></p>
<p>I found this organization through Ohio Advocates for Medical Freedom, and they send out emails that tell people who exactly to email or call to voice their concerns.  I ended up emailing the HR and executive officers of 4 major health networks because they pointed me in the right direction.</p>
<p><em>"We represent thousands and thousands of healthcare workers who are uniting to stand for our own healthcare choice and privacy. For years healthcare workers have been required by their employers to subscribe to a mandatory vaccination program against our wishes. Now the general public faces the same with Covid-19 vaccines becoming mandated in their places of employment, as a requirement to attend school, and even as a prerequisite to participate in society. We say enough is enough. No more mandatory vaccines for anyone! If a product is so safe and effective, our industry wouldn't need to bribe and force people to subscribe to the product. We will no longer be silenced by our corporate employers, we will no longer be bullied into receiving a vaccine against our wishes, and we will no longer stand idly by as our industry guilts and shames our patients. Join us!"</em></p>
<p><strong>Share the organizations that you have joined that are speaking out for freedom.</strong></p></p>
