    <strong>What do you believe?</strong>
    <p><p>Hi everyone, sorry if this violates any rules. I've been hanging out off and on here for a while for a different perspective, and I'm trying to get a more complete picture of people's beliefs. I'm not here to troll! So here goes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you think COVID is real? If so, how infectious/deadly is it?</li>
<li>Are vaccines generically effective in reducing viral transmission? What about the COVID vaccines? I ask this one because I think there's a general anti-vaccine rep of this sub, which I doubt is true, as the skepticism seems to center on this one.</li>
<li>What are good/trustable sources of information? How do you decide who or what to believe?</li>
<li>If it is true that COVID has been intentional mass hysteria, what was the goal? What was achieved as a consequence?</li>
</ol>
<p>My answers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Yes. Compared to other pandemics, not close to as lethal (from \~2.1% fatality in reported cases). Fairly high infectivity (from median 5.7 R0).</li>
<li>Yes. Pretty effective looking at early results of papers, but things will probably change as the effects wear off. Not perfect. </li>
<li>This one is hard for me. Honestly, if I see a news article that mentions a study, I check if they actually quote the study, and if so that's usually enough for me. I like to look at the abstract/title of papers, but I do not know anything about biology so that's as far as I can go. </li>
<li>Also hard for me. Full disclosure, I'm vaccinated, and if a business or something asks me to wear a mask I do it because I don't mind. </li>
</ol>
<p>I know I didn't source anything I said here, if anyone needs one I should be good. Hope it's not a waste of anyone's time.</p></p>

<p>2 not sure, cant know yet</p>
<p>3 cant trust anything, always look skeptical at everything</p>

        <p>Thanks for replying. Okay, for 1 and 2 I think we pretty closely agree. For 3, I think it's fair to not completely trust that anything is unchangeably true. But is there any piece or form of information that could come out that you would believe?</p>

        <p>1) yes its real,seen it up close and seen people die off it</p>
<p>2) just heard tonight that there's another bad outbreak with very sick people in a fully vaxxed with pfizer nursing home close by, so less and less</p>
<p>3) I don't believe msm at all! if you told me that I would think this way 1,5 year ago and that they would call me a antivax person I would have laughed so hard</p>
<p>4) get as many people vaxxed as fast as possible, before we find out something they can not hide anymore. Let's hope its all just about money</p>

        <p>Thank you for replying. I definitely relate to the whole msm thing, it feels so weird to have my trust in "news" gone. Now it feels like I don't believe anything unless there's a paper attached, but even that isn't completely reliable obviously. As for 4, if it does turn out like that...I hope it's all about money too.</p>

        <p>Covid is real and there isn’t enough information regarding the vaccine to come to a clear conclusion on the safety / effectiveness of it. Americans are full of FEAR. </p>
<p>It would be interesting to see how this would have played out if Trump wasn’t in office. I feel like the establishment made covid out to be way worse than it actually was to help get him out of office.</p>

        <p>You could be right. I trusted the claims of people generally believed to be experts, and I trusted the claims of published scientific works. But posts on this sub have made the good point that assuming these institutions are benevolent is always a mistake. I've been rethinking things. On the other hand, I haven't seen any evidence I'm going to suffer for it. What do you think is the long game?</p>

<li>
<p>Yes. And like any novel virus, it has swept through the population. This one largely targeted the unhealthy and elderly, which is much better than the Spanish Flu. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are we talking vaccines in general? Then yes. Most vaccines are. This MRNA vaccine, however, has been shown to not stop transmission; only reduce symptoms. Which may be great for elderly, who are at risk. But for someone who has already had covid and developed immunity, it is pointless (actually just an unnecessary risk)  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>3.i get info from a variety of sources. It is incredible how much MSM bullcrap you can debunk with a simple search of CDC statistics. </p>
<ol>
<li>The hysteria was because we didnt know anything about it to begin with. Now, the ruling class cant admit to the public that it was all for nothing. All the destroyed businesses, the lockdowns, the thousands of metric tons of masks every day, the division, the hate, the increase in drug abuse and alcoholism, ultimately saved probably a handful of people. The effects of their leadership were disastrous on our lives, yet impotent against the illness. So they have to puff it up as bigger than it is now to scare the people into being thankful to their oppressors.</li>

        <p>Thanks, I think I agree with most of this. The only difficulty really is knowing whether, if absolutely nothing was done, the effects of the virus would have been more disastrous. I'm inclined to believe they would have been worse, but don't know enough to be confident about it or have any idea just how much worse.</p>

<li>
<p>No. I did at first, but gradually, over time, it became clear to me that it was mostly just a combination of the common cold or flu that was going around. Not some new virus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes. But I don't trust this one, and even to the extent that I believe in vaccines, I still refuse them on principle because of the immunity that their manufacturers and the government enjoys. For this reason, I don't get any vaccines anymore until that immunity is removed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My experiences. I don't trust the government or the media. My experience tells me that over the course of the last 11 months, out of the dozens of people that I know, only 3 have tested positive for COVID. One in his 50s, one in his 40s, and my best friend, in her 20s. Out of these three, two described it as like the flu, one described it as like a head cold.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Control. Millions of people have fallen for their spell. Some are controlled by fear, others are just bootlickers who want to make sure they fall in line. And the division between those who have allowed them to be controlled and those who haven't is what's scary. We, who resist wearing masks or getting vaccines or vaccine passports, are not the ones calling for reeducation camps. We are not the ones threatening others with their livelihoods. But we ourselves are threatened for the crime of making a different choice than the others. They have successfully managed to gain control of millions, and turn them against the remnant.</p>

        <p>Regarding 4, I'm sorry. The rhetoric surrounding people who choose to go unvaccinated is... scary. Regarding 1, I guess I'm not sure how it could be clear to you that it isn't a new virus. Some viruses are similar or have similar properties, no? It seems superficially possible that there could be a new virus which seems similar to old ones, and yet has small differences. Not like I know anything about biology, though.</p>
<p>I think 3 is really interesting, and I think there's been a lot of movement to the viewpoint of exclusively trusting one's own experience. I wish there was a way to build trustworthy institutions, but I don't even know how you'd get started. For things that aren't really experience-able (like ideas about astronomy, idk) do you just ignore them?</p>

        <p>I don’t let anything in this matrix harm me. Look into Germ Theory - it’s bullshit pseudoscience. Viruses aren’t even alive. Everything they tell you about SCIENCE is backwards.

        <p>I'm sorry, I might just be unfamiliar: can you explain what you mean by "this matrix"?  Interesting about germ theory, I hadn't heard that but I'll spend some time looking. Second, are you saying everything the establishment says about science is untrue? Or just in the context of COVID? Really appreciate it.</p>

<li>By this do you mean the flu ALSO has a 0.2% mortality rate? Is the expectation that the total number of cases is 11x the reported number?</li>
<li>Sure, makes sense.</li>
<li>Feel pretty similar: definitely no "news" networks. Would you trust the results of a study in a journal?</li>
<li>Yep, understood. Pretty much in agreement here.</li>

        <p>1.Yes it's real. For healthy people I think it's as contagious and deadly as the flu.
2. Some vaccines are very important and needed, such as polio, if you are elderly or sick than I think you should consider getting the vaccine, but we cannot know the long term effects.
3. I ignore most of it. I see the people around me who have worked this entire time, as I have, and I am not worried, because I think its overblown and hyped up. I also dont trust the number of deaths being claimed because of Covid. I think plenty of dying people caught it and died, but they were on there way out anyway so its disingenuous to say it's because of covid.
4. The goal was to gain more control. Its working.</p>

<p>Yes, about the same as the seasonal flu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I cant really speak on this as I havent looked at the data, but with the media reporting that cases are still spiking even in vaccinated populations, I have to say it sounds ineffective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think its important to not listen to the obviously sensationalized media. Don't listen to somebody else, read for yourself. Reading published studies from reputable sources and drawing your own conclusions based on the evidence is the only true way to say that your opinion on the matter is valid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most large scale projects intend to find answers to several questions at the same time. So there is no one true reason. Several ideas I have for the plandemic include: </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Causing a diversion
In order to get the publics minds off of other, more serious political scandals</p>
<p>Gauging citizens compliance
Determining just how much the populace is willing to strip away their own rights in times of strife, or lack thereof</p>
<p>Practice
For biological warfare</p>

        <p>1 yes it is real but the risk mostly depends on your health more conditions equates to more risk, but the risk it's over blown big time. See pcr testing
2 yes generally, and I have mine. Don't get the flu shot because I got it once over a decade ago and was worse than the flu, which I tend to not get anyway can't remember the last time I had it. This mrna vax doesn't look great especially with more data coming about breakthrough cases and horrible reactions to it, seems riskier than not getting it to me, maybe after the trials are over, but I doubt it.
3 both "sides" are susceptible to fake news and exaggerated headlines, I'll dig into the source studies when I can.and there are a few experts who I will listen to what they say (though that is a loaded term these days). Generally when someone goes from a world authority to persona non grata it will make me more interested not less. Examples Dr Robert Malone (one of the inverters of the mrna platform) and Dr Gerry vanden Bossche (was big league vaccine guy with WHO and Gates Foundation) the later warns of how vaccines will breed note infectious variants which you can watch the media try to blame on the unvaxx'd.
4 <em>puts on tinfoil hat</em> to stamp out populism/freedom, the great reset, depopulation, or maybe just Chinese incompetence and opportunistic elites are using it to achieve the former, government loves power and hates giving it up. That being said I say a meme suggesting conspiracy theories should be called spoiler alerts recently and think there is a lot of truth to that.</p>

        <p>1 The more that comes out, the more I doubt... Now supposedly the tests they used to drive fear for over a year are completely faulty &amp; can't tell "Covid" from a flu. Despite the flu not even being a coronavirus.</p>
<p>2 Yes, &amp; maybe even the Trump juices. But! For anyone under 65, the risk is higher than the gain. </p>
<p>3 Seems that nothing by the US is trustworthy anymore. I look at reports from other countries &amp; see how they compare. </p>
<p>4 The goal? MONEY!!!!! Just, follow the money. Who profited? Who was made to suffer?</p>
