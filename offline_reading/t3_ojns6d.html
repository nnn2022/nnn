    <strong>We just live in completely different worlds</strong>
    <p><p>Check this out <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/state-society-and-vaccines-registration-162578614011?aff=erelexpmlt">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/state-society-and-vaccines-registration-162578614011?aff=erelexpmlt</a></p>
<p>So anyway someone sent this my way and I'm disappointed that the POV is already taking the stance of <em>vaccine solves all problems</em>.</p>
<p>I already know think tanks are bs but I hoped for more since I think futurology can be really cool field of study. But also not surprised since I've been around actual people involved there and the louder voices consistently come off like self-congratulatory/change-the-world/tech influencer wannabe types who genuinely try but can't always see outside their pseudo-intellectual futurology box that is fully based on capitalist problem-solving. And they can't see outside it either because of ego or intense desire to appear impressive to others who have made fortunes and careers being stuck in that same box. This was my impression even pre-covid, and I am certain this is the same faulty mindset that drives anyone getting paid or benefited by systems of power right now, aside from the ones who are just straight up evil.</p>
<p>I guess what I want to summarize here is, remember that we humans really don't know everything and in fact a lot of our intellectual development from the past hundreds of years are based on lies and shit that no longer applies.</p>
<p>Let's not mar our perspective on technological growth with the assumptions that humans need to conquer nature with tech, rather than asking the question: what if we harmonize with nature? In covids case this is respecting and caring for our immune systems in the ways that work for us individually, over profits and intellectual glory/one size fits all thinking.</p>
<p>But I know I'm speaking to the choir. In closing, some encouragement because I appreciate you all: it's hard but don't be too emotionally affected by bullshit, just live your life, it's not always as bad out there as it appears online even for me and I'm in a major brainwashing center. Being kind and firm while holding strength integrity and humility usually cause those who are uncertain about themselves lose it, which means you were in your power.  It's uncomfortable for them at first, but eventually shows them the way. No convincing needed</p>

<p>EDIT: a few clarifying words</p></p>

        <p>Corporatism is capitalism, they just funneled all the capital into big companies now that have more power than governments. </p>
<p>Corporatism is crony-capitalism , then they use policy and politicians to advance their $$$ agenda (neo-liberalism)</p>
<p>Socialist/counist countries is cuba and Viet Nam handles it the best. </p>
<p>Communism would say fuck all these guys, we need to take control of their factories and make it so the government doesn't put us into debt buy buying their trash vaxxes and make out own through social programs.. </p>
<p>Note, not communist and have no capital, just a stoner that wants peace.</p>
