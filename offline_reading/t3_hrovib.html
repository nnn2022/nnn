    <strong>Patients Who Refuse Masks: Responses That Won't Get You Sued</strong>

<p>These masking articles assume everyone who is not wearing a mask is infected and spreading, which is blatantly not true. Even with rising cases, most people do not have the virus and thus aren't spreading it. </p>
<p>I looked at the comments on the article and I'm surprised that in all the comments I read, only a couple are questioning how a physician could be liable if the unmasked person doesn't even have the virus. Instead, everyone seems to focus on the worst case scenario, disregarding how unlikely that really is. If a lawyer can't argue successfully in favor of a physician client in the case of a patient suing due to another patient being unmasked, the physician should really be getting a new lawyer.</p></p>

        <p>I think masks are dumb. I’m in MA where they’ve been mandatory since May, but I never bought one.  (I found a shitty disposable ear-loop mask in my car’s First Aid Kit.). </p>
<p>But... I do think a doctors office is one of the few places to be cautious of others.  Right?  </p>
<p>Prior to corona, most people would happily take steps to protect the vulnerable from their droplets.   Especially now, a person <em>actually in</em> a doctors office is probably there bc of a serious problem.  (Everyone else had appts cancelled or gets the phonecall.)</p>
<p>I have actually do have a few weird breathing problems, truly severe anxiety and sensory sensitivity.  But I wear a mask bc I also don’t have the emotional capacity to effectively present my case to a store clerk.</p>

<p>This is the only reason I wear a face covering as well (a sheer cloth, for the absolute minimum amount of time).</p>
<p>I have been on the other side, and I have no desire to make a retail worker's day more shitty. It is not their fault our garbage government press-ganged them into being "mask police".</p>

        <p>These people think you can sue any company or organization if you think you’ve contracted Covid from their establishment. We need laws protecting people and businesses.</p>
