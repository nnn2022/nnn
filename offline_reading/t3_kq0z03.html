<p>&rt; "Before you say: "Its the masks and social distancing!" I don't think so. People simply are too dumb to understand how to do it properly. I see people lower their masks to talk to each other, huddle up to hear each other, and reuse dirty, sweaty, contaminated masks for WEEKS."</p>
<p>&rt; "And then you have oxygen deprivation... People pretend like its no big deal. Yet people with medical conditions such as asthma don't wear masks because it puts their health at risk. So its a significant difference enough of oxygen to put some's health at risk, but not others?"</p>
<p>&rt; "So your immune system is running on low oxygen, fear building up chemically in your brain, you use slimy nasty masks you never replace, and you circumvent them to communicate unmuffled. The only thing that would make this better if they injected themselves with untested vaccines."</p>
