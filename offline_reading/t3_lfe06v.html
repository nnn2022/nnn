    <strong>A little more on Asymptomatic Transmission</strong>
    <p><p>An recent post on the thread was describing the study that showed that asymptomatic transmission did not really exist.  The article being discussed quoted the often-quoted statement on the CDC website that "over 50% of cases could be asymptomatically transmitted."    I thought it would be good to examine that statement.  This seems to be the research being quoted:</p>
<p>https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774707</p>
<p>First to mention that this is not a study or experiment, this is a model doing analysis of existing data.  So right up front of the article it states:</p>
<p>&rt;The baseline assumptions for the model were that peak infectiousness occurred at the median of symptom onset and that 30% of individuals with infection never develop symptoms <strong>and are 75% as infectious as those who do develop symptoms.</strong></p>
<p>(emphasis mine)</p>
<p>So it starts with the assumption that asymptomatic people are 75% as infectious as those with symptoms. It goes from there to arrive at the over 50% transmission figure. It doesn't prove asymptomatic spread, it assumes it.</p>
<p>I thought this might be interesting information for anyone who finds themselves having this, er, "discussion".</p></p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing. I have read the findings of that study before, but I never fully read it to find out about the assumptions. Good to know!</p>
