        <p>Lol a one month lockdown in Melbourne. It was 4 months. It was a hard lockdown too. No businesses were allowed to open and only essential workers allowed to go to work. A 5km radius around your house. If you step outside your door it was 100% mask mandate. You could only leave your house to exercise for an hour a day. You couldn’t sit on a park bench and enjoy the sun or your will be arrested.</p>
<p>This was done to get the cases from 300 a day to zero. Imagine starting at 1000 a day. It would be a around 6 months hard lockdown.</p>

        <p>Hard lockdown means no "essential" workers. No delivery services. No going outside if you wear a mask. Stay inside your house and don't come out or have anyone come over. Hopefully you have enough food and don't have an emergency.</p>
<p>Melbourne never had a hard lockdown, even if it was harder than what we had, but this cannot be taken as a serious solution at this point.</p>

        <p>What if the electricity goes off, or pipes block, or their house catches fire? They're so fucking stupid and ignorant. Most people don't have enough money to have enough food and other supplies for a month, and if you announced this plan people would be piling into shops and fighting each other for stuff</p>

        <p>I mean, my twin toddlers have gone an entire year without getting sick. No ear infections, no strep, at most just a runny nose. My wife and I haven't gotten sick either. This is a first in our family. It's the same with all our friends and extended family. It sure makes me inclined to think lockdowns and masks are working.</p>

        <p>We're not living life in a bubble. We're just following the guidelines of wearing masks in stores, not going over to other people's houses, etc. The kids have been in daycare the whole time, except for one two-week covid scare. It's actually been a pretty unremarkable year for us. We definitely miss having friends over, and I miss going into the office, but we've been enjoying ourselves. I'm literally in a hotel room on vacation with my wife as I write this.</p>

        <p>I can certainly understand the argument that we're weakening our immune systems with these safety measures. But I think that argument is not really correct. The kids have been going to daycare the whole time, and my wife went back to teaching elementary school in-person a few months ago. We're also way less militant about the safety measures than many others we know. So our exposure hasn't really stopped. The evidence in my life shows that some combination of masks, social distancing, etc, has dramatically improved our health.</p>
<p>Granted, we do eat fairly healthy in my family and maintain a fairly active lifestyle. But that hasn't stopped us from getting sick plenty in the past.</p>

        <p>Or, perhaps, it's because so many others are taking precautions? Remember that masks aren't really to protect the wearer; they're to protect everyone else from the wearer.</p>
<p>If you didn't get sick last year, whereas you usually get sick, but you didn't do anything differently, then the logical conclusion is something changed in your environment to make it less conducive to spreading sickness.</p>
