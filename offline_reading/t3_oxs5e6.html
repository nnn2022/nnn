    <strong>"Once everyone started masking, I stopped seeing friends in person" - Olga Kazhan, The Atlantic</strong>
    <p><p>This is from a decent and recent piece called <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/07/should-you-wear-mask-indoors-if-youre-vaccinated/619519/">"Two Ways to Think About the New Mask Debate"</a> and you know what? Olga did good work here. Olga lays the out cases, if not the conclusions, very well.   </p>
<p>Olga has a throw away line about masking that really gives away the entire game, IMO. Up in the OP, she doesn't even blink when she observes that she's been spending less time with friends. </p>
<p>The powers that be want us to be consuming mass entertainment, not sitting around talking with friends. Not drinking with strangers.  Nope. </p>
<p>What's most human about being human, outside of running, is interacting with both friend and foe. And that's what they don't want us to do. </p>
<p>What Olga is missing is the same thing as other vocal vaccinated liberals are missing: We hear the news about overflowing hospitals, shrug, and say get back to us when the morgues can't keep up. </p>
<p>Protect yourself or don't. I don't give a shit.</p></p>
