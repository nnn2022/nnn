    <strong>Breaking down the use of buzzwords and labels since the beginning of Covid.</strong>
    <p><p>Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic we have heard a lot of different buzzwords and labels being thrown around in the mainstream media and on social media as well. 
In this essay I will be breaking down their use as well as giving my opinion on the purpose they serve.</p>
<p>If you are at all up to date with the current progression of the situation regarding COVID-19, I’m sure you’ve heard terms such as “anti-masker”, “anti-vaxxer” and “Covid denier” thrown around quite a bit by folks on social media and mainstream media personalities as well. 
I’m sure their explicit meaning is very obvious (though funny enough, the way they are used actually doesn’t line up with their explicit meaning at all), but beyond that, the real questions are: what purpose do these buzzwords and labels serve exactly and why are people so apt to throw somebody else in one of these boxes and seal the lid?</p>
<p>In my personal opinion these buzzwords and labels are practically a form of slander and serve the purpose of devaluing someone else’s opinion and character, usually for the purpose of not having to hear out their argument or to steer other people away from listening to them, along with damaging their credibility and reputation overall. </p>
<p>I think they are sly in nature and lead to increased polarization as well as less or more difficult communication between people of differing viewpoints.</p>
<p>Their main purpose is to aid the advancement of the official Covid narrative and to discredit those with even slightly dissenting opinions. 
For example, if you are skeptical of taking a vaccine with rushed development, limited testing and no long term testing whatsoever, you are liable to be labelled as an “anti-vaxxer” for not mindlessly agreeing the vaccine is good and showing no skepticism. </p>
<p>The same applies to skepticism regarding the lethality of Covid and the measures being taken to “keep us safe”. If you express that you think people are far too worried about a virus with a survival rate of over 99% for most people or disagree with the restrictions that have been put into place, you are liable to be labelled as a “Covid-denier” for not being scared enough I’m guessing.</p>
<p>There is no nuance in these buzzwords and labels, they are a cheap way to silence and shame people and they only make it much more difficult to have civil and rational conversations about these subjects due to introducing the constant risk of being put into a box and treated as such if someone feels that your opinion even slightly lines up with what they feel these buzzwords mean. 
I emphasize the words they feel, because these labels are so broad and lack nuance to such a degree that what actually constitutes a “Covid-denier” seems to be up to the person using the term instead of it meaning what it explicitly states.</p>
<p>Does expressing surprise at the fear response this virus has gotten from a large part of the population or criticizing the (deeply and unnecessarily harmful) restrictions that have been put in place legitimately constitute “Covid-denial”?</p>
<p>Maybe if you’re so unnecessarily scared of this virus that you think any opinion or view other than: “Stay scared! Do exactly what the government and media tell you to! Don’t ask any questions or express skepticism, no matter how reasonable!” is somehow denying Covid. (Or maybe denying the danger it presents? You think when they designed the label they would include a bit more nuance so it actually makes sense…)</p>
<p>So again, these labels and buzzwords were originated by those dedicated to pushing the official narrative regarding COVID-19 to eliminate dissent among the population.
I think they are truly reprehensible for the fact that having civil discourse is very difficult at this point in time along with polarization being at an all time high among the population and anybody doing anything to make that more difficult or less feasible is doing something truly irresponsible and morally reprehensible.</p>
<p>In conclusion I think we should do our best to avoid taking any of these labels or buzzwords seriously and focus on having civil discourse about these subjects with those who are willing, especially those who disagree with our points of view.
This goes both ways, however I would also advise we stay away from discussion with those who will not remain civil and simply wish to demean and shame others with no regard for legitimate discourse as I believe speaking with these people is a waste of time and effort.</p></p>

        <p>You're right.  When you control the language, you control the argument.</p>
