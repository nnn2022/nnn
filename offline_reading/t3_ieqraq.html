    <strong>Thoughts from a pro-masker (I agree with you about one thing)</strong>
    <p><p>I started browsing this sub with an open mind to try and understand some of you. For background, some of my beliefs:</p>
<ul>
<li>I recognize the mixed findings on mask efficacy, but I still lean toward the evidence showing that they are effective. I personally wear one in indoor establishments.</li>
<li>I think that indoor establishments that don't enforce mask policies (like bars) are hotspots for transmission.</li>
<li>Like it or not, your freedoms are always considered in the context of societal benefits. For example, in the U.S. you are not free to smoke inside most indoor establishments. Neither are you free to consume alcohol under the age of 21. I see wearing masks for societal benefit as no more of an infringement of my freedom than these examples.</li>
<li>I genuinely care, and have always cared about the "grandmas". And grandpas, and fathers and mothers.</li>
</ul>
<p>I still disagree with most of the ideas presented on this sub, but I'll admit there's at least one thing that I agree with you on: what people do in their own private space (for example, parties) is their own business.</p>
<p>If you logically think about it, even as a pro-masker, there should be no reason to be worried about large <strong>private</strong> gatherings held by others. Because I wear a mask and keep my distance from people outside my household (and because I believe, rightly or wrongly, that these measures are effective), then why should I, or a "grandma" that takes proper precautions, care if the person in the grocery store next to me just threw a rager last night?</p>
<p>Now, this premise requires at least one assumption: that the people who choose to do whatever they want in private still adhere to mask policies in public spaces or indoor establishments (e.g. grocery stores).</p>
<p>I therefore disagree with the sentiments on this sub that openly support disobedience of mask policies in stores. If you choose not to wear a mask at your party, fine; but if you choose not to wear a mask standing next to me or "grandma" at a grocery store enforcing mask policies (which they have every right to enforce), then yes I have a problem with that.</p>
<p>The only counterpoint to the idea that private gatherings are OK might be the argument that, by allowing people to party in private, we are simply lengthening this whole process. No one is enjoying this, not even pro-maskers (contrary to some of the beliefs here). However I'm not fully convinced that banning private gatherings would substantially reduce spread.</p>
<p>I have a feeling many of you will agree with at least some of this, but not all of it. I'm open to hearing more of your thoughts. I'm also open to hearing thoughts from other pro-maskers who think I'm off base about this.</p></p>

        <p>The virus is nowhere near as bad as the MSM and politicians make it seem.  Masks are not necessary to begin with.  The fact you condone it only contributes to the hysteria that has taken over the world.   And thats exactly what it is:  mass hysteria.</p>

<p>Even in high-mask wearing countries like South Korea, Japan, and the Phillipines cases are rising. </p>

<p>I'm bringing this up late (I had the thought earlier but forgot to bring it up), since it's now receiving more attention. Comorbidities are not equal to pre-existing conditions. Many of these comorbidities can be directly caused by the virus. You're presenting this statistic with a biased skew.</p>

        <p>You misunderstand comorbidity. From the CDC:</p>
<p>“Comorbidity means more than one disease or condition is present in the same person at the same time. Conditions described as comorbidities are often chronic or long-term conditions.”</p>

        <p>I don't misunderstand them. Pre-existing conditions are a <strong>subset</strong> of comorbidities. Just look at the data: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#Comorbidities">https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#Comorbidities</a>. Things like ARDS, respiratory failure, respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, sepsis, etc. are not chronic pre-existing conditions. They are acute conditions that can occur together ("comorbidities") and contribute to death. All of these acute conditions can be brought on by infection.</p>
<p>I can also tell you from personal experience looking at the death certificate of a family member who contracted a respiratory infection years ago, that the comorbidities listed on their certificate were pneumonia, respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, and sepsis. Literally all of them. And they were all downstream effects of the infection.</p>

        <p>And:</p>
<p>“A comorbidity is simply defined as a pre-existing medical condition of a patient, or the presence of one or more medical conditions known to increase risk of death, that exist in addition to the most significant condition (usually recorded as the "most responsible diagnosis" on hospital discharge abstracts) that causes a patient's stay in the hospital.”</p>

        <p>This definition is just wrong. Your other definition is correct. Just think about the word "comorbidity". All it means is that multiple conditions are present at the same time. The condition can be pre-existing (chronic), or acute.</p>

<p>Lol what the fuck. Where did you learn debate?<br>
Of course (s)he's not fucking saying that. The argument is that the virus is by far not as deadly as is said. 'A HEALTHY 20 YO DIED WE ARE ALL AT RISK'. No, we are not. Only people with a high amount of comorbidities are, but the narrative is being warped. Most of the population has nothing to fear from this virus.</p>

<p>People with comorbidities (like me) matter and are responsible for their own health the way they've always been. My uncle had cancer and had to stay inside during chemo. Imagine him and other cancer patients being offended that the entire fucking world doesn't bend to them the way obese people do with covid. Laughable.</p>

        <p>This is the only widespread pandemic that nearly everyone living today has had to deal with. People are afraid (rightfully or wrongfully). The other examples you listed have unfortunately been normalized. I'm not saying it's right, I'm just giving you an answer to your question.</p>
<p>Note that I never said I was in support of a lockdown, nor was I in support of stopping the world for SARS-Cov-2. My question was a genuine "what level of social responsibility do you think is appropriate"? </p>
<p>PS: you make good points, but if you want to convince people like me (luckily I'm starting to be convinced by others in this thread), you might want to consider a less argumentative approach. I don't mean this as a jab at you, I'm just saying that if you're right, people will be more receptive to changing their minds without subtle insults or aggression.</p>

        <p>It didn't dissuade me, but it probably dissaudes a lot of people. People like to be understood first, not attacked, in order to be receptive to a different perspective. Just human behavior. And after all, isn't the point of these discussions/debates to try and get the other side to be receptive to your perspective?</p>

        <p>Other than the fact that 99.7% of people survive it which is on par with normal flu numbers, case rates are hugely inflated by false positives.  The PCR nasal swab test is highly flawed. It detects multiple versions of coronavirus, not just SARS cov 2.  Plus, many deaths were recorded as cov deaths when in fact they died from something else entirely.     Basically, the numbers are totally cooked to the point of being laughable .  </p>
<p>The media and politicians are serial liars and then the gullible public who blindly obey their authority figures, enable and condone the lie, so here we are. </p>

        <p>I appreciate your willingness to listen and have a mature dialog.</p>
<p>The key point I would push back against is that freedoms [should be] considered in the societal context. What level of risk is acceptable and what is not? Who gets to decide? Who gets to measure the risk? Can rights come and go? </p>
<p>I would argue that smoking in public or the drinking age shouldn't be laws. A choice of businesses or persons? Absolutely. But not at the long arm of the law. </p>
<p>Not a single store in my area required masks until the state orders came. So in my view it's no more fair to say masks are the choice of private businesses than alcohol or smoking laws. They're doing it at the threat of fines or lawsuits.</p>

        <p>This. The day the mandate goes away, 50%+ will no longer wear masks in most (not all) circumstances. At least in my area. Many stores will drop the rules as well, after doing a cost/benefit analysis. </p>
<p>Someone will counter with “but the polling says everyone AGREES with these mandates” and I find that not to be the case at all. They may say they do, they may wear a mask in certain indoor circumstances, but no...they don’t agree with mask mandates. After all- if they did- why would we need a mandate? If they DID support this in large numbers -  this problem would have been solved via the free market. It wasn’t. Some stores required (Costco for example) and others did not. It will be the same once the mandate is dropped. </p>
<p>This is how it should have been for smoking. </p>
<p>As for private parties...I see no enforcement of this whatsoever anyway (short of massive parties that borderline disturb the peace). I don’t see anyone seriously advocating for it either.</p>

        <p>Good points. Regarding the point about freedoms, there's certainly a spectrum of risks and the freedoms that have to be considered when evaluating those risks. I personally think legalizing everything that doesn't "harm others" would probably have negative consequences on a fruitful society. Should we legalize all drugs for example?</p>
<p>Regarding who gets to decide, that's the role of government, the role of the people we elect to govern. It's the implicit contract we "sign" by living in this country. They have the power to make laws. I don't see how government would work otherwise. Ideally, they would be informed by evidence when making risk evaluations and how they pertain to our freedoms.</p>
<p>I realize many people think the evidence is weak, or that those governing have made the wrong risk evaluations. That's why we have this sub, and the right to free speech, and the right to protest. If you think the decision is wrong, then provide the evidence, write your representative, or elect someone else who think is in line with your views. But in the end, whoever you elect will be able to make these decisions. Are there any alternatives?</p>

        <p>We depend on government to make evidence based laws, but they aren’t making laws; they are issuing emergency orders that have no end date. </p>
<p>Nor are they evidence based, as there is no science behind physical distancing, or lockdowns, and no RCT studies that suggest anything other than low certainty of the efficacy of masks for source control or personal protection regarding viruses.</p>

        <p>There are meta-analyses and epidemiologic/observational studies showing benefits of distancing.</p>
<p>RCTs are not always practical in time-sensitive scenarios, let alone in time-insensitive scenarios (I can tell you by experience as a researcher). If something is perceived as an emergency then should we wait years for an RCT before issuing guidance or mandates? What if this was a more severe virus? Do you think it would be OK for the government to sit on its heels waiting for an RCT before doing anything?</p>

        <p>Sadly there were no such studies when this started. Physical distancing is base on a 14 year old’s science project. From NYTimes:</p>
<p>https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/us/politics/social-distancing-coronavirus.html</p>
<p>There have been policy and qualitative reviews:</p>
<p>https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/what-is-the-evidence-for-social-distancing-during-global-pandemics/</p>
<p>No meta-analyses either. There are some observational studies now, but too many confounding variables to be certain. </p>
<p>I will certainly concede that physical distancing is a pretty safe bet though. So hand washing and social distancing work, which is pretty much Sweden’s (and Denmark, Norway, and Finland) approach.</p>

        <p>I would argue drugs should be legal as well. The main reasons being that 1. People are doing them anyway and 2. Legalization could bring safer manufacturing and end the reliance on the violent black market. But this is another discussion.</p>
<p>You have a great point about the government being the ones we elect to make these decisions. But that presupposes that we have a healthy, functioning Republic with strong local representation. We all know that's not the case. In many circumstances, what local sheriffs and state representatives/senators are saying is in opposition to what governors or federal authorities are doing. So I have to forgo my rights, wishes, and interests. That doesn't seem like a 2-sided contract to me.</p>

        <p>Well first of all you did. You said you "disagreed" about the evidence, and as I pointed out, evidence is not a matter of opinion. And evidence means more than "here's some articles." You've gotta read and analyze those articles. That's how you get evidence. </p>
<p>Now I actually read (most) of these articles. They're not very compelling. Article #2 posits that at some hospital, the introduction of masks caused the rate of COVID19 to go down. But correlation doesn't equal causation. You gotta look at what else happened at the same time. And notice, when masks were introduced rates were at 21.32%. <a href="https://twitter.com/yinonw/status/1295152579941249024">And wouldn't you know it, rates of COVID19 always start to drop when hit they around 15-20%.</a> That's herd immunity.</p>
<p>Article #1 is a little more complex. Now according to it, masks reduce viral shedding. Now I'll be honest with you, I wasn't familiar with the concept before I read the article. Not sure if you were. Anyhow, a few things jumped out at me reading it:</p>
<ol>
<li>It has a ridiculously small sample size. It looked at only <strong>17</strong> people with COVID19, and most of them didn't even have viral shedding in their aerosols or droplets without the mask</li>
<li>It looked at symptomatic people, so it no way relates to unsymptomatic people wearing masks </li>
</ol>
<p>And most importantly, just because they found something in a lab doesn't mean it would work in real life. You'd need a randomized, controlled trial to determine that. And wouldn't you know it, there were a bunch of them done during the SARS crisis, and they all came to the conclusion that having everyone wear masks would be pointless. </p>
<p>That's why everyone, from the CDC to Fauci to the WHO, all were against masks in March. And when they changed their mind, there was no new evidence that contradicted those ones from the SARS era. It was totally political. The podcast explains it.</p>

        <p>Your definition of evidence seems to imply "100%" fact, which isn't a thing for either side of the argument. For reference, I have read an analyzed those articles, am an active researcher in the biomedical field, and am not just blindly linking articles. Against it's not a question of evidence, but the strength of such evidence.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://twitter.com/yinonw/status/1295152579941249024">And wouldn't you know it, rates of COVID19 always start to drop when hit they around 15-20%.</a> That's herd immunity.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, I don't mean to sound rude, but for someone promoting use of strong evidence, you're linking me to twitter? If I recall there are articles reporting higher rates of COVID-19 than 20%. I'd need something more believable to accept that rates always drop at 20%.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;It has a ridiculously small sample size. It looked at only <strong>17</strong> people with COVID19, and most of them didn't even have viral shedding in their aerosols or droplets without the mask</p>
<p>To be clear, none of them had COVID-19. They were looking at human coronavirus (the kind that causes common cold). You're right most of them didn't have viral shedding without a mask, but in all cases the mask did reduce shedding in both droplets and aerosols (though not always statistically significant). I concur with your point that the sample size is small. It is by no means the strongest evidence, but it is evidence.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Fair, but performing an RCT before you make public health policies for a largely unknown virus (at least at the time) isn't exactly an ideal strategy. Could you link to the RCTs for SARS and masks?</p>

        <p>Yes I linked to a twitter thread. It was a well written one. The writer used primary sources to support an argument. I could have done the same thing but he did it so well, so why bother? That said, a number of academics have made the same point, such as <a href="https://reaction.life/we-may-already-have-herd-immunity-an-interview-with-professor-sunetra-gupta/">Sunetra Gupta.</a></p>
<p>So this is my point: evidence is not "here's some articles." And it's not "this expert says so." It's using facts to support an argument. </p>
<p>I'm getting sick of writing. So I'll leave you this article from 2006:</p>
<p>&rt; http://www.upmc-biosecurity.org/website/resources/publications/2006/2006-09-15-diseasemitigationcontrolpandemicflu.html</p>
<p>Read the part about masks. Read the whole thing but read the part about masks. Also read this:</p>
<p>&rt; https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577</p>
<p>It's the only RCT ever done on cloth masks. It doesn't paint a very rosy picture. They talk about it in the podcast I mentioned.</p>

        <p>I think we're getting too caught in the semantics of what "evidence" means. Regardless, back to your point about 15-20% antibody prevalence for herd immunity, that doesn't even relate to the study I linked. They are talking about positivity rates. Antibody rates are totally different, as the writer of your twitter thread even mentions. The positivity rate of a population can certainly increase beyond 20%.</p>
<p>I listened to the podcast. I admit its convincing.</p>

        <p>I’m an engineer who used to read medical studies for a living. Having read over 100 mask studies I can tell you that there is no study that says they definitively work or don’t work for virus source control or protection. </p>
<p>So go with whatever makes you comfortable. 5 minutes in any store will show that nobody wears them properly. Health workers get a full day of instruction and discard used masks. The don’t touch them frequently or put them in their pockets. </p>

        <p>Your first study refers only to surgical masks (not cloth) and uses a 30 minute breath sample. That tells us nothing about the use of cloth masks in casual indoor situations. </p>
<p>Your second study actually says:
“The decrease in HCW infections could be confounded by other interventions inside and outside of the health care system”
So really doesn’t provide proper evidence that masks alone make a difference.</p>
<p>Edit: added “minute” to 30 breath.</p>

        <p>Your first point is fair.</p>
<p>And I'm aware of your second point, most studies will be confounded by other factors unless they are a well-designed RCT. It is by no means a conclusive study, but it nevertheless is evidence (along with other studies) pointing to the possibility that masks may work. As I mentioned in my post, I recognize the mixed findings of mask efficacy.</p>

        <p>TLDR For the audience:</p>
<p>Your first link: Some real data here, but does NOT measure buydown of viral <em>transmission</em>, while acknowledging that only some forms of shedding are reduced by masks.  They acknowledge that they their data were limited by large amount of undetectable viral shedding in particular for flu and c19 contrasted to that for rhinoviruses (common cold).  They conclude that it would make sense for sick people to wear masks (good idea, we did that for SARS and H1N1 and everyone was cool with it!).</p>
<p>Your second link: concludes health care workers should consider wearing masks (no kidding) but acknowledges that their data are confounded.</p>
<p>What we don't have is a true measure of risk reduction.    Can't weigh benefits versus costs if you don't have a measure of benefit.   No grounds for a universal mandate.</p>

        <p>Man it is really refreshing to see your question here, simply because it is so open minded and mature, no attacking, just genuine curiosity. Thanks so much for that. </p>
<p>My response is that masks don’t work against viruses, because viruses are so tiny. Yes they make decent barriers against saliva, mucus or blood, but not the tiny viruses carried. </p>
<p>I am very much concerned about the psychological effects of mask wearing. </p>
<p>When we cover our smiles, we are covering positivity. The mask is an inhuman replacement and promotes a feeling of fear. (Masks are scary, that’s why they are big at Halloween) Also, in combatant training, it has been observed that soldiers are less empathetic about the enemy if the enemy is wearing a face covering. It has been estimated that prolonged wearing of face coverings can cause a population to become 50% more prone to violence.</p>
<p>ETA: the combatant training info is in LTC David Grossman’s book, On Killing</p>

        <p>Sure, a mask may not work against an isolated virus, but we don't have isolated virii coming out of our mouths. They're paired with a carrier, whether it be a large droplet or a tiny aerosol. I think there's decent evidence that large droplets are blocked by masks, but aerosols are a separate question.</p>
<p>I haven't considered the psychological effects. Is the "50% more prone to violence" statistic from the Grossman book? It seems unbelievable, but I'd be willing to look into it.</p>

        <p>&rt;I often say that if you think about it a mask is a quite literal infringement of you freedom of (facial) expression and speech. It makes it difficult to communicate verbally or by visual cues.</p>
<p>No kidding! I had no idea how much I used facial expressions to communicate, nor how much of a lip reader I was, especially in noisy environments, until everyone around me at work is wearing a mask on an entire shift.</p>
<p>What this type of comment is usually met with however, is that this infringement is "worth it" because of the lives being saved doing so. However, the data and the evidence says otherwise.</p>
<p>I personally don't like doing things just for the sake of doing them and accomplishing nothing.</p>
<p>I remember how my mom (now elderly) used to be so annoyed when telling me to do something in an authoritarian tone without reason - specifically how it would be followed up, as soon as I was able to talk, with the question "But why?!"</p>

        <p>Humanity is the basis of all value commitments, and without it nothing has value or value-oriented purpose. It is primarily through face to face communication, expression, and interaction that our humanity is most manifest, making the utilitarian purpose of wearing face coverings to reduce the risk of spreading germs no longer rational. </p>
<p>To put it another way, by dehumanising ourselves with mask wearing, we negate precisely what we are aiming to protect, our human existence.</p>

<p>masks (like N95) are rated at a PPM filtration value for the wearer and environment. this is why they are in the drywall section of Home Depot.
they are Dust Masks.
and the is also why they are referred to as PPE. Personal Protection Equipment.</p>

        <p>Appreciate the mature convo happening here. I’m curious, what are your views on those who medically cannot wear masks? Do you believe exemptions should be honored or do you think there are no valid exemptions and we need to stay home if we can’t wear masks?</p>

        <p>I mean I’m glad that you’re one of the ones who thinks this way. Unfortunately we’re not getting exemptions, even though the mandates include them, and I can guarantee life is a living hell right now for those of us who medically can’t wear masks. 
You state that “if you choose not to wear a mask standing next to me at a grocery store enforcing mask policies then yes I have a problem with that” so does that extend to those of us with medical issues too? You state that you believe exemptions should be made yet you indicate you don’t want maskless people in the store with you.</p>

        <p>I hate to sound harsh, but all I am really interested in right now is data about how effective masks are, not opinions, theories, or anecdotes.</p>
<p>Pro-maskers don't have a consistent coherent position other than that they think it might be a good idea, and they can't even get their stories straight about the mechanism for benefit, and they absolutely will not pony up any real empirical data about degree of effectiveness.   Data always involve uncertainty and pro-mask has more of a religious quality to it which does not tolerate uncertainty.</p>
<p>We are now seeing additional rules around about what kinds of masks are allowed and how they are supposed to be worn WITHOUT ANY DATA.</p>
<p>It is completely irrational to impose a blanket mandate without a consideration of the benefits AND costs.   If you can't quantify the benefit you have nothing.</p>
<p>But, people are irrational, and this is how the supplement industry, homeopathy and other quack medicines continue to propagate.   Masks are in the same category.</p>
<p>If I had to bet I would guess that masks will turn out to be like vitamin C.   Beneficial in a few specific contexts that we already know about but nowhere nearly as beneficial as the early proponents claimed and not at all worth a universal mandate.</p>

        <p>My issue with masks (from primarily a scientific perspective) is that people are citing science as a way to justify them but it’s all too abstract. Science simply isn’t abstract. You mention that there is evidence for their effectiveness. But i haven’t even seen a consistent definition of what effectiveness even means. Effective at what? Preventing the at-risk population from getting infected in stores? Maybe. Preventing spread by x%? If so, by what %? Do we even care what percent this number is? </p>
<p>Nothing but questions. And even asking these questions means you are anti-science. But masks are just one policy of many that should (in my ideal world) be part of some larger plan that has a clear and measurable goal that we can track and adjust our policies as needed. Furthermore you can’t just make baseless claims like the trade off is a win because wearing mask has no downsides. Even that needs to be quantifiable and shown with data, otherwise it’s just opinions. </p>
<p>I believe I saw you refer to yourself as a scientist in some post here. If so, have you heard of the “noise floor”. I think it is very likely that most of our measures simply aren’t going to overcome the noise floor for this pandemic. This is why it’s very difficult to find any correlations between policies and the actual data that we have. But the noise floor only really applies to the pandemic as a whole. Your example of mandating masks to protect the at risk population, makes some sense to me. But that is  not how masks are being pushed.</p>

        <p>Great points. The response has certainly been lacking in terms of a cohesive plan that can be comprehensively evaluated, and adjusted based on the evaluations. If there's one thing I've taken from this thread, it's that there are certainly legitimate questions that aren't being asked or answered by a number of people. I appreciate those who have had civil and understanding dialog with me here, it's hard to come across. I realize "skeptics" get bashed quite often by "doomers", but "doomers" get just as bashed by skeptics.</p>
<p>I'm familiar with the concept of noise floor but didn't think of how it might be applied to a pandemic, that's an interesting idea I'll have to think through.</p>
