    <strong>Is anyone else massively depressed by the movie delays?</strong>
    <p><p>I know Iâ€™ll be called selfish elsewhere for this but movies were genuinely the only thing left to look forward too. </p>
<p>I wanted to see Spiral on my birthday but that was delayed ( I hated my birthday) </p>
<p>Then other titles like Godzilla vs Kong, A quiet place 2 and then Halloween kills were delayed ( Iâ€™m dreading how people will act this year because people will be out living).  The only movie left I really want to see is Candyman 2020 which replaces Halloween kills. </p>
<p>Going to the movies was a big thing I did since I started college. It gave me a few hours away from the world and was always a great time. Itâ€™s getting harder to live in a world without fun.  Only working and going home to repeat like some worker bee.  Thatâ€™s not what life is.  Itâ€™s just existing.  And with some articles ( and the hypocritical Fauci) saying how we wonâ€™t return to normal by 2021 itâ€™s making me depressed.  If I say this anywhere else Iâ€™ll be called selfish , not thinking of others etc but I hate it.  I hate existing and not living</p></p>

        <p>Oh, man. Terry Schiavo was a fucked up case.</p>
<p>I think the family was being selfish by keeping her alive in a braindead condition. Other people could have used that hospital bed and medical resources.</p>
<p>I especially don't like how it was made into a media debacle with her barely-functioning body being shown all over the news.</p>
<p>Most fucked up of all is that they just removed her feeding tube and it took her days to starve to death. I get it, Hippocratic oath and all that, but if she had ANY brain function at all then it must have been agonizing.</p>

        <p>I don't watch a lot of new Hollywood movies but I see a lot of movies at arthouses and repertory theaters. Most of them are small and independent and I will be very sad when those start to close.</p>

<p>I could have written this myself. I agree, what life has been reduced to is just awful.</p>

        <p>The weird thing is that the only two theaters open in my town are independents.  The big chains keep pushing back their openings.  They just need to OPEN and the studios need to bring the movies ASAP.</p>

        <p>I think there's two major reasons they can't/won't just open:</p>
<p>1) They will likely be fined and/or forcibly closed down, especially in places like NY and NJ. For instance, a gym in NJ that rebeled, and re-opened against Murphy's orders <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/nj-can-shut-down-gym-that-defied-coronavirus-closure-court-rules/2479477/">has now been ordered to remain closed indefinitely</a>. It seems the majority of judges side with the governors.</p>
<p>2) They are likely afraid of public backlash. AMC originally announced masks were optional, for instance, then they relented after they got "cancelled" online over that. I imagine if they re-opened against governor orders, people will turn on them even more. Remember, people, we are not a majority opinion... Most people are still buying into the narrative the virus is dangerous, and you die or get permanent damage.</p>

        <p>Yeah we are. And /r/movies and /r/boxoffice is making jokes about it.</p>
<p>They dont care if cinemas near their area will close down for good. They think put everything online is just the same as the experience.</p>
<p>This reveals that they take everything for granted.</p>
<p>People will flood to the cinemas the first chance they get because they do not want to sit in front of the tv about covid/blm/trump/biden</p>

        <p>The people on r/movies for some reason acts like it's all because the USA handled the virus poorly. But they have no prosblem with theaters being closed and movies being delayed either way; they are totally content destroying everyone else's jobs and livelihoods (as well as only accelerating the destruction of the planet, but I digress) just so they can sit on their asses all day and play video games and watch streaming.</p>
<p>Every movie subreddit I go to always blames the USA response to the virus. It needs to be emphasized to these mouth-breathers that it was the lockdowns, not the virus, which closed this stuff</p>

        <p>Itâ€™s okay to like something and be sad that itâ€™s gone. Escaping into movies has always been something Iâ€™ve liked but especially makes sense now since life is so bleak. I tend to watch indie movies not  big blockbusters so those have been coming out on streaming and digital since theyâ€™re not huge theater moneymakers. A film fest I used to go to yearly was cancelled, and it sad some of the shows I like wonâ€™t be back for a long while.</p>

        <p>I'm very pro-theater and cannot stand these people who say that they are fine with or want theaters to go away so movies can be released on "streaming" only.  I'm hypothetically fine with the movies themselves being delayed, meaning that I don't need to watch a certain movie anytime soon.  I'm more concerned about the health of theaters.  Unlike a lot of restaurants which can offer take-out, governors keeping theaters closed means they have no revenue.  They are sinking.  If I could be assured that theaters could stay closed for a while until fear stops controlling people and asshole governors would come to their senses, with no financial issues, that would be fine, but that's not the case.  They need to sue governments for lost revenue, both small theaters and huge chains.  If a government wants you not to exist, they need to pay until they deem in their overreach that you can exist.  </p>
<p>It's all fear, this whole thing.  Some theaters are open and I've been to theaters mainly for old movies five times since mid-June.  The sole multiplex currently open in my area is renting out whole theaters for $50 - bring your friends and family and choose the movie from the ones they have that week.</p>
<p>I say open ASAP and bring new movies.  It's got to be done.</p>

<p>Damn, dude, if there was a theater near me doing this (and there probably isn't), I would totally rally the troops from work to get people on board.  I guarantee I could probably get at least 15 strong in on it - I've got a ton of young guys in my office that are dying for things to do.</p>

        <p>I think it's something theaters should do when they reopen as they won't have too many new movies and can rent out whole theaters to make some money up.  In this one it's $50 for I think a 25 person limit.  I guess you could pay $50 to have the theater to yourself too, but I went to <em>E.T.</em> a couple weeks ago and was the only person in the place anyway.</p>

        <p>I love movies. I rarely went to movies in the last few years because (IMO) most movies of the last 15 years or so are crap (but that's subjective).
I am a big fan of the tv show "General Hospital". My life fell apart about a year and a half ago (largely due to my own fault) and that show was one of my main comforts on life. The doomers took it from me. I hope it comes back next month but dates keep getting delayed.</p>
<p>You're not being selfish. The doomers are. THEY are the ones who want to prevent others from doing things they love. THEY are the ones trying to radically alter human society. THEY are the ones with a list of demands they want to be enforced with state violence.</p>

        <p>There's quite a bit of sci-fi on the show - memory transfers recently, in the past aliens and cryogenics.
It used to have a spinoff, "Port Charles", which became a full-on supernatural soap with time travel, a vampire, a werewolf. (The vampire returned to town some years back for a storyline on "General Hospital".)</p>

        <p>I love movies. Where I live, which is a hi desert community and quite remote in many ways, we have a little independent movie theater with 4 screens. We would support them by going to see a movie every week. For more indie type movies we would drive down the mountain to the Palm Springs area. Not being able to go see movies is so depressing. I got called selfish and uncaring simply because I was upset the Oscars might not happen. . Anyway. Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with loving movies and  wanting to see them on a big screen! Itâ€™s like all the joy has gone from our lives and we are supposed to be fucking ok with that!  No. I am not ok with all this. I feel your pain.</p>

        <p>I mean, I personally am mainly upset because the lockdowns and mask shilling perpetuates my already-high levels of anxiety. And really, I just wanna get back to normal and start dating, getting into work, being able to go to the gym and restaurants, etc. I'm just fucking sick of it all and think people need to start making their own decisions and letting others live how they want to live</p>

        <p>Oh absolutely. Going to the movies been my favorite thing to do since I was 4 years old. Since streaming took off, I have been worried that movie theaters were going to come to an end and Iâ€™m sadly convinced of it now. </p>
<p>Iâ€™m so upset about theaters being shut with no end in sight that I cannot even watch movies that went to streaming that were initially going to be theatrical releases. My all time favorite actor is Tom Hanks and I would see his movies the moment they opened. Greyhound has been available to stream for weeks and I havenâ€™t watched it because it makes me too sad. I also love live theater and am worried about the future of that. Cannot watch Hamilton on Disney+ for the exact same reasons.</p>

        <p>Streaming is also way more expensive. Considering you need Netflix, Disney +, Amazon Prime, Hulu and others it gets ridiculous.  Steaming just doesnâ€™t give me the same effect and atmosphere as the Cinema does. I donâ€™t think theyâ€™ll close forever though</p>

        <p>Not even close to the same atmosphere. At home, thereâ€™s so many distractions and interruptions. It took me 4 hours to watch Marriage Story. Had I been in a theater, I could just have focused on that for 2+ hours.</p>

        <p>Iâ€™m right there with you. I love going to the movie theater. I hate when I hear people go on about how streaming a movie is better than theaters. To me itâ€™s not. Itâ€™s not always about the movie to me, itâ€™s about the experience and memories. Iâ€™ve seen many good films and many terrible ones, but each carries a memory to me.  For example, my college roommate and i going to see the terrible Nicolas Cage film season of the witch and cracking jokes. Or when I watched Rush with my father. Or the time a ex girlfriend and I saw mama Mia.  Memories are formed at the movies. My dad remembers seeing the empire strikes back with his two Nephews. I like the experience that a theater can bring seeing a movie on the big screen in a crowd. something streaming lacks. Streaming is just not the same.</p>

        <p>No, man. There are literally more movies that you can download right this second then you could ever watch in a lifetime. Lockdown sucks but letting this get you depressed speaks to deeper issues. You shouldn't be so obsessed with the latest thing to spend money on that you think you're "not living" when you don't get a chance to do it.</p>

        <p>There's no use arguing with these types. This is an argument I've had even before COVID.</p>
<p>"Why would you go to a theater when you can just pirate or download a movie? I don't get it!"</p>
<p>I wrote a similar comment up above, and yeah, similar train of thought. To these people, the "ease" of buying stuff or watching stuff online means they don't need to move or do anything, thus it's "cool" to do everything online. But people like I and /u/deadshot45661 want to go out, and experience things, go to a theater, eat snacks, chat with friends, watch a movie, and be thrilled or disappointed or <em>whatever</em>. Sure, you can technically stay at home, and do this, but it's not the same experience. It's really not, and it's certainly very different when you are under quarantine, and <em>forced</em> to laze around your house, and watch crap.</p>

        <p>Definitely. I hate being in my house all the time.  And at home I get pretty distracted but I enjoy the social aspect of seeing a movie and actually interacting with people.  Like I saw Star Wars ep 9 and the cinematic experience really made it better for me, seeing everyone excited for the movie and the atmosphere on opening night was awesome.

        <p>I'm not the OP, but if I may give my two cents: I love going to the movies. I also watch a ton of movies at home. But if given the choice between seeing a movie at a theater and at home one I would pick the theater any time of the week. It's not about seeing "the latest thing" (in fact, the last movie I watched in the theater was from the 80s). I find seeing a movie on a big screen with booming sound surrounded by strangers invigorating. It makes me feel alive. Watching movies alone I enjoy but it doesn't make me feel connected with others.</p>
