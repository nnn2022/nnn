        <p>Why are you spreading misinformation?   Even the CDC says the IFR is not that high.   Do you have any idea how many millions would be dead if this was as bad as the Spanish flu?  And they’d be young people too.  Seriously, do you get off on trying to spread panic?</p>

        <p>Well two millions are already dead.</p>
<p>The WHO has an approved a study from  <a href="https://www.who.int/bulletin/online_first/BLT.20.265892.pdf">John P A Ioannidis</a> which states a much lower IFR based on antibody results, if you are refering to that. But people back then didnt have this technology with the spanish flu, so we can only take symptomatic cases in record.</p>
<p>I am coming from a German perspective. Deaths are recorded very professional here.</p>
<p>If you take asympomatic cases away, the deaths caused by Covid-19 will not be affected by this and this would mean the IFR is even higher.</p>
<p>The spanish flu only caused more deaths because it was more infectious, not more deadly. As the spanish flu and Covid-19 can not be compared for their effects on the human body, it makes no sense to say that "more young people would have died". Im just taking in the overall IFR. If you look at the reported cases of infections and deaths, its a 2% deathrate for Covid, not taking anti-body tests into recount.</p>
<p>If Covid-19 would infect more people, millions more would have died. Its the curse of restricitions. If they work, few people die and you say "well seems like we didnt need to restrict ourselves" and if they dont work youre upset about the dead.</p>
<p>500k dead in the US alone should be a wakeup call.</p>
<p>But as a sleeping sheep med student, Im open for you beating me down on this one. Mabye my profs told me lies.</p>

<p>No, it was the living conditions that were worse back then, than now. And people were stressed far more than now. If you do the same today you will get the same results. If you have doubts go live as a homeless person for few weeks and see what happens. Sickness, diseases and everything magically appears.</p>

        <p>&rt; No, it was the living conditions that were worse back then, than now. </p>
<p>Yes, yes, more infectious. I didnt say it solely lies in the genome of the virus.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; If you do the same today you will get the same results.</p>
<p>But living conditions are better now as you said it, what do you mean? You could argue that back then, Covid-19 would haved caused much more deaths because there were no treatment, no science, no advanced hygiene, no interwebs, no reddit.</p>
<p>But you are right to bring up homeless people. That is a major concern! I totally agree with you that homelessnes is worse and a bigger risk than getting the virus and dying from it. But Im arguing from a German perspective, people here wont get homeless if they lose their business. My country provides a safety net.</p>
<p>I accept that if you are arguing on the current state of the US not providing help to the people who are affected by the restricitons. You cant lockdown a whole country if it leaves millions of people jobless/homeless.</p>
<p>That doesnt erase the danger of Covid-19.</p>
<p>BUT wearing a mask doesnt put you close to being homeless. Staying home if home-office is an option, doesnt make you homeless.</p>
<p>Be reasonable and I support any critizism against stupid rules. Being against wearing a mask is not and this sub obviously doubles down on that. You sure this is the place to be?</p>

        <p>What do you mean more infectious? You know you can emulate the living conditions of the past. It's not hard. Pollute the water you drink with dirt, reduce basic hygiene for example shower only when the temp is above 15c, don't wash your clothes, switch off heating etc. And you will see how all the "diseases" you read in history books will reappear in your place.</p>
<p>Living conditions are better today. So you get less stress. You don't work 80 hours maybe you work 40 hours. And there is no lack of food or wars that happen every so often.</p>
<p>Do you supplement? Do you take all necessary nutrition? Do you exercise? Or you have a bad lifestyle? Lifestyle is what plays the biggest role. If you are healthy you cannot get sick. Sickness is way down the line of neglecting health. So ok look at this here:</p>
<p><a href="http://tobacco.stanford.edu/tobacco_web/images/tobacco_ads/doctors_smoking/more_doctors_smoke_camels/large/camels_doctors_whiteshirt.jpg">http://tobacco.stanford.edu/tobacco_web/images/tobacco_ads/doctors_smoking/more_doctors_smoke_camels/large/camels_doctors_whiteshirt.jpg</a></p>
<p>For decades this was a social habit. The generation that followed those habits have poor respiratory function now. So of course influenza or sars can wipe them out. If your respiratory system is damaged enough, you will die. It is guaranteed 100% and no drug will save you. But when you are healthy you cannot be even infected. You cannot be a host for a virus because your primary immune system will clean up the garbage very quickly if that ever happens.</p>
<p>Wearing a mask detriments your physical condition. Wearing a specific mask to do a job is one thing. Wearing a mask as part of a lifestyle is very bad. And it is bad for the environment too disposing those masks.</p>
<p>Ok you can try a mask and sprint or go up stairs and see the difference wearing one vs not wearing one. And then there is literature that supports it. It's not my idea that my performance changes because I use a mask to emulate altitude every so often, as part of training. But that's for 10 minutes and with breathing exercises. Not all day, every day. </p>
<p>I will make another post with a list of issues with facemasks</p>

        <p>Here is a list I compiled see for yourself.</p>
<p><em>the use of surgical face masks was associated with a significant increase in airway resistance, reduced oxygen uptake, and increased heart rate during continuous exercise.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7752911/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7752911/</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7306735/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7306735/</a></p>
<p><em>Dyspnea variation was significantly higher with surgical mask</em></p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29395560/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29395560/</a></p>
<p><em>Ventilation, cardiopulmonary exercise capacity and comfort are reduced by surgical masks and highly impaired by FFP2/N95 face masks in healthy individuals.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7338098/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7338098/</a></p>
<p><em>Wearing an N95 mask significantly reduced the PaO2 level (101.7 +/- 12.6 to 92.7 +/- 15.8 mm Hg, p = 0.006), increased the respiratory rate (16.8 +/- 2.8 to 18.8 +/- 2.7/min, p &lt; 0.001), and increased the occurrence of chest discomfort (3 to 11 patients, p = 0.014) and respiratory distress (1 to 17 patients, p &lt; 0.001).</em></p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15340662/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15340662/</a></p>
<p><em>Irritant contact dermatitis was common on the cheeks and nasal bridge due to pressure and friction. Irritant dermatitis was associated with personal history of atopic dermatitis and prolonged mask wear (&rt;6 hours)</em></p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33011325/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33011325/</a></p>
<p><em>Respiratory pathogens on the outer surface of the used medical masks may result in self-contamination. The risk is higher with longer duration of mask use (&rt; 6 h) and with higher rates of clinical contact.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31159777/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31159777/</a></p>
<p>And other side effects affecting the heart</p>
<p>Inconsistent breathing, even slight, profoundly affects heart rate variability (HRV) And breathing constantly through masks certainly affect HRV. Read more here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4311559/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4311559/</a></p>
<p>There are also reports for oral damage which i haven't completed the list.</p>
<p>Also with respect to environment</p>
<p><em>...disposable face masks (single use) that get to the environment (disposal in landfill, dumpsites, freshwater, oceans or littering at public spaces) could be emerging new source of microplastic fibers, as they can degrade/fragment or break down into smaller size/pieces of particles under 5 mm known as microplastics under environmental conditions. The Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis (see Supporting Information for details) of the degrading face masks (</em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7297173/figure/f0015/"><em>Fig. 3</em></a> <em>) was carried out using PerkinElmer, UATR Two, USA, against a plastic specific spectral library (Perkin Elmer ATR of Polymers Library). The spectra showed a characteristic peaks of a polypropylene for the outer layer (</em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7297173/figure/f0015/"><em>Fig. 3</em></a><em>a) and polyethylene high density for the inner layer (</em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7297173/figure/f0015/"><em>Fig. 3</em></a><em>b). The spectra provide a piece of evidence that face masks could increase the accumulation of their related microparticles in the environment within a short time.</em></p>
<p><em>Another implication of this indiscriminately disposed face masks in the environment is the possibility of acting as a medium for disease outbreak, as plastic particles are known to propagate microbes such as invasive pathogens</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7297173/"><em>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7297173/</em></a></p>
<p>Plus the various elements in a mask</p>
<p><strong><em>Polyester</em></strong> <em>is a synthetic fabric that derives from petroleum, which essentially makes polyester a byproduct of oil. For the consumer, the issue with this fabric is that it doesn’t breathe as natural fibers do, which means that your sweat can’t evaporate, which is uncomfortable and can cause acne and rashes. For the environment, the consequences are even greater as polyester is not naturally broken down, which is a big problem as it continues to fill our landfills and oceans.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Neoprene</em></strong> <em>(wetsuit fabric) is a synthetic fabric. The North American Contact Dermatitis Group performed 10 years of research into neoprene allergy, and found that sensitive individuals can develop allergic reactions ranging from simple redness to painful blisters. For many people, the only way to avoid a reaction is to avoid the product.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Acrylics</em></strong> <em>can be found in anything from sweaters to masks. The issue with acrylics is that they contain</em> <strong><em>dimethylformamide</em></strong>*, a chemical known to cause liver damage. This chemical is so potent that the people who manufacture acrylic fibers have to wear protective gloves just to touch the clothing they are making.*</p>
<p><strong><em>Conventional Cotton</em></strong>*: We tend to think of cotton as a “natural” fabric, which to a certain extent it is. While cotton is grown from the ground and not in a lab, the cotton used in the fashion industry is usually still treated with a concerning amount of toxic chemicals. Typically cotton that is used in textiles is treated with pesticides, colored with toxic dyes, and treated with chemical coatings in order to give clothing the bright and shiny effects that consumers are drawn to. And while we all may love the convenience of having a wrinkle-free dress, all of those added chemicals make this “natural” fiber anything but natural.*</p>
<p><strong><em>Azo dyes</em></strong> <em>are common synthetic dyes used for coloring clothes, leather, and textiles. These dyes contain amines, which have been shown to increase the risk of bladder cancer in dye factory workers and hairdressers. The next time you’re looking for a dress in your favorite color, try reaching for a product with organic dyes to avoid these toxic effects.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Phthalates</em></strong> <em>are a fast fashion favorite. They are used in waterproof clothing, so think raincoats and leather. These phthalates are known “endocrine disruptors” that have been linked to both male and female reproductive issues because they interfere with how hormones communicate with our bodies.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Nanosilver</em></strong> <em>is an antimicrobial agent used to treat a wide variety of medical equipment, including gloves and face masks. Some research has already found that silver nanoparticles can kill brain cells in exposed rodents. There is also a concern that this risk may apply to humans as well, but lack of research has made it determine what level of exposure is considered dangerous and what the long term effects could be.</em></p>
<p><em>Anything that advertises itself as</em> <strong><em>static resistant, stain-resistant, flame retardant or wrinkle-free</em></strong> <em>develops these properties by being treated with formaldehyde, nonylphenol ethoxylates, or triclosan. These chemicals are absorbable through the skin and have been associated with reproductive and developmental effects in rodents, and potentially in humans as well.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Formaldehyde</em></strong> <em>has also been associated with skin reactions and nasopharyngeal cancer and is a likely culprit for facial dermatitis that is being seen in healthcare workers required to wear face masks all day while at work. Studies on factory workers who are exposed to triclosan suggest that regular exposure may contribute to increased cancer risk.</em></p>
<p><em>Despite these known effects of these chemicals, there is no regulation for the number of chemicals that can be used in products sold in the United States or a requirement for brands to report which chemicals are used in their clothing.</em></p>

        <p>So shortness of breath while exercising, irritated skin, and possible self contamination which can be mitigated by changing masks every ~6 hours. </p>
<p>There seems to be little evidence shown regarding the concentration of chemicals and their risks regarding masks specifically. Agreed, their disposal in the environment is concerning but that seems like more of a waste management issue vs an issue with masks in general. Both these issues can be solved in part by wearing a reusable cloth mask. </p>
<p>The “dangers” of masks as you’ve laid them out, seem minor compared to their efficacy in preventing the spread of COVID. There is absolutely no reasonable equivalence that can be drawn between wearing a mask and smoking.</p>

        <p>&rt;Well that's your opinion</p>
<p>Not really. There's well documented research of the short and long term effects of directly inhaling particulate matter from cigarettes whereas there is just about nothing on the trace chemicals found in surgical masks (which are avoided with cloth masks).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Therefore the only negative consequences of masks described in your studies seem to be shortness of breath during exercise (which is often the goal while working out) and dry skin. You also seem to have a somewhat random study talking about heart rate variability in regards to physiological and psychological processes with no mention of masks. </p>

<p>In 1982. It's a mystery. The same are saying with vaping and facemasking. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; shortness of breath during exercise (which is often the goal while working out) </p>
<p>Smoking also has that effect. Feel free to use facemasks for your life but I don't want to destroy my life. Shortness of breath implies damage, it's the body's signals you can no longer adapt. So you start mouth-breathing temperature rises in the mouth, ph falls and acidity increases and different bacterial proliferate causing even more trouble with cavities. That's extra oral damage. </p>
<p>So far I haven't seen you presenting anything about masks improving physical performance. And all documents show they reduce it. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; If at this point you don't believe that masks lower the spread of covid19 then you're not really living in reality </p>
<p>It' s not matter of belief. I don't get infected by sars because I am healthy. Obviously you are not because you cannot adapt the environment you're in and you need an aid. Like a walking stick to walk. Lack of adaptation the environment you are in means sickness. It's right there.</p>
<p>Why you think propaganda will change my mind? I don't get sick with covid and that article will not change my physiology. </p>
<p>&rt; Clearly not. </p>
<p>You have no proof so you are lying, you don't even know me. </p>
<p>&rt;The short term discomfort of masks are minor compared to their benefits and the long term consequences of smoking .</p>
<p>Wearing a facemask all day, every day it's not short term, it's long term. And there is no benefit for me.</p>

<p>&rt;So far I haven't seen you presenting anything about masks improving physical performance. And all documents show they reduce it.</p>
<p>Sure but so what? Maximum physical performance is not necessary for the vast majority of people in settings where masks are recommended.  People generally aren't putting their VO2 max to the test when getting groceries or riding in an uber. In addition the potential damage  from getting covid is almost certainly worse.</p>

<p>...short term as in the effects mask wearing has stop pretty quickly after you take your mask off. Long term as in you will continue to feel the effects of smoking and/or covid long after you quit or recover.</p>

        <p>&rt; Who? Who is saying the downsides of masks are anywhere close to outweighing their benefit? </p>
<p>There is no benefit from these masks in this context of my life. I use masks for emulating altitude, for protection creating chemical formulas, I see no reason wearing a surgical mask to "protect you" because I don't protect you. And you don't protect me. I don't and cannot get sick by this virus so there  it is.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;  Maximum physical performance is not necessary for the vast majority of people in settings where masks are recommended </p>
<p>I don't think you understand what physical performance means. If I can lift 100 lbs, I see no reason to detriment my physical down and lift 90 lbs. It's like you can walk  on your own, but you get a walking stick. It makes no sense and it is detrimental because there is other literature as I said of oral problems, breathing patterns, extra microparticles inhaled from the direct contact to the mask and it is constantly used. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; Just because something hasn't happened yet doesn't mean it won't or can't.  </p>
<p>Well it's impossible. Sars is well beneath my physical limits. Not a chance. There is no comparison with cars because there is no factor that can influence my capabilities in this case. The reason you may get injured by a car is because the damage inflicted can be beyond human limits even if you are a body-builder. Same goes with a tsunami. Its force is beyond human limits. Sars is within my limits. I can't vouch about you or anyone else though. And seatbelts are supposed to protect the driver not others, so it's not a comparison and in fact seatbelts do a very poor job and are very intrusive and you can get pinned down. Also average car speed in cities in 7 mph by the way. You can get more damage from a bicycle. Airbags is the way forward.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; Also by that logic you're equally as sick if you can't adapt to a mask. </p>
<p>You get sick gradually yes. Because of what I mentioned. The same goes with cigarettes, damage accumulates, your respiratory system is damaged with the constant use. Same goes with vaping. Or if you live in a polluted environment. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; short term as in the effects mask wearing has stop pretty quickly after you take your mask off. </p>
<p>Where do you see the short term? I told you I am using masks (the proper mask) to perform various tasks. I tell you what, if you want to protect yourself 100% against a virus (any virus) with a mask, this is the mask you must use:</p>
<p><a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8186%2B2nB2sL._AC_SL1500_.jpg">https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8186%2B2nB2sL._AC_SL1500_.jpg</a></p>
<p>That's what I would use if I go to work in an environment where my physical limits are lower than required. You put the right filter with right cartridge for the right job. And that gives you 100% protection. I don't see people promoting masks doing that. They stick a piece of fabric in their mouth. </p>
<p>So it's always in this sequence. First adaptation, second protection. You don't use protection if you can adapt, because protection has side effects and detriments physical performance. And here are the accessories:</p>
<p>Cartridge <a href="https://imgur.com/QwMQkOt">https://imgur.com/QwMQkOt</a></p>
<p>Filter <a href="https://imgur.com/NmDw4Ci">https://imgur.com/NmDw4Ci</a></p>
<p>That's what you should be doing. I am not going to rely what others do around me. It's nonsense. Why don't you do that if want to be 100% protected? why asking others to protect you? I don't get it.</p>
<p>As I told you I will not get infected 100% because with my current physical level the environment I can adapt to, has worse things than sars. There is much more stress. That is right now. I don't know after 5 years how I would be. But right now there is absolutely no way to be infected.</p>

        <p>First and foremost had we not locked down  there would have been a couple million more deaths in this country. So yea it is pretty effing relevant to you saying that the virus isn't that bad,  because Yea thanks to medical science we figured out how to stop viral infections much like we did with the  bacterial infections that plagued us for millenia and people like you just take it for granted or simply deny confirmed science by saying hey look that  virus  isn't that bad because we can kind of control it with modern medicine. While whining that the measures that need to be taken to avoid millions of deaths infringe on your rights because you have to wear something as trivial as a mask and can't go to your favorite bar or restaurant.  Boo f"cking hoo. And then further yet ignoring the fact that many parts of the world and this country for that matter don't have adequate access to hospitals let alone the ventilators and other breathing treatments that  are the only thing stopping people from dying. </p>
<p>So according to you let's just not do anything and just hope it doesn't spread to those at risk populations right? Just so people can go drink and party it up in public places? Or is it because you can't handle wearing a mask in public to help save your fellow citizens and your own family's lives?</p>
<p>Ya know my uncle didn't take this seriously either until he brought it home from working at a very public facing business and it put his wife in the hospital and he luckily only had mild symptoms. </p>
<p>Thanks for the analogy though, as you inadvertently made a very good point that  anti maskers and covid deniers aren't much different than the ignorant people of the middle ages.</p>

        <p>Covid patients only got put on ventilators when they can no longer breathe on their own.  Meaning they were on life support and would die without one and while it is no big secret that prolonged ventilator use causes long term damage and death.  In the beginning doctors had no other option but to keep them alive on the vent for as long as possible in the hopes of a proper remedy getting found and approved before their patients died and now that there are some treatments and a vaccine the vents won't have to be used as  much, if at all now.</p>

        <p>&rt; Because Covid-19 is mainly spread by asymptomatic people? </p>
<p>you can't spread something you don't have. And you can't accuse people without proof. "Asymptomatic" is an excuse really. The same way I would argue that you are not fit to drive a car and you need to be examined every day before driving. </p>
<p>Health is a relative term used to represent your body's and mind's ability to adapt to a given environment without getting injured or getting sick. There are physiological and mental limits to this adaptation. For example you cannot live in the ocean as a fish does. Now some people can swim, some people cannot, some people can withstand low temperatures for 1 hour swimming some people cannot even for 5 minutes. Therefore the adaptive capacity of each of us is different but the limits remain. That adaptive capacity is your health.  Therefore in this example if people can withstand swimming in 10c temperature for 1 hour without  getting hypothermia that means the stress from that environment is within their limits. Not everyone can do that though but it is possible to be achieved.</p>
<p>So sars is well within human limits. You cannot claim someone who is not infected is an asymptomatic carrier because he can adapt to the environment. That's like saying in the example above someone is wet therefore he might get hypothermia. So you make a claim without even knowing the other person and his capabilities. </p>
<p>Moreover the fact a person can adapt to an environment it means he can withstand challenges associated with that environment. Like swimming requires training, or breathing techniques to dive underwater also requires training etc. So if I can withstand that level of stress, I cannot possibly become a disease host for sars Because the stress I am already going through, is way higher than what sars can ever possibly cause. That's why I cannot get sick with sars. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; People with symptoms for ebola got on planes you know? </p>
<p>These names are meaningless by the way because I have no idea what it means and I have to look it up. The disease you are talking about is not transmitted through the air. It needs something else like body fluids and those fluids somehow must get inside you and if your immune sucks you get sick. So I am not sure what are you trying to say here. If a person is injured yes, he can be infected but that's an exception. But he can't transmit it because it's not an airborne pathogen. Now if you cannot adapt to the environment, you will get sick way before ebola or whatever latin name you come up with. It's like you cannot swim and you worry when the cold temperature hits you. It makes no sense because you will drown before you freeze to death.</p>

        <p>These "people" think that democrats caused covid, that democrats overreacted about the lethality of the virus, with some even saying the virus doesn't exist at all  yet they insist on collectively attacking Cuomo for the nursing home deaths that were caused by what they say is a non existent virus(contradiction much? ) with the ultimate goal being that the lockdown orders will force the people  to rely on the government for help and thus become subservient to the government.</p>
<p>Which in a way could be somewhat like Muchausen by proxy if what they thought was even close to  reality.</p>

        <p>Her nephew got it and she had come into somewhat close contact with multiple times right before he showed symptoms. So she went and got tested for her own peace of mind and I had to have surgery recently and they require that you get tested a few days before hand.</p>
<p>So how did I prove your point if neither one of us got sick from the test?</p>

<p>ah, you're dumb. ok, here something to educate yourself:</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocebo</p>
<p>&rt;A nocebo effect is said to occur when negative expectations of the patient regarding a treatment cause the treatment to have a more negative effect than it otherwise would have.[1][2] For example, when a patient anticipates a side effect of a medication, they can suffer that effect even if the "medication" is actually an inert substance.[1] The complementary concept, the placebo effect, is said to occur when positive expectations improve an outcome. Both placebo and nocebo effects are presumably psychogenic, but they can induce measurable changes in the body.[1] One article that reviewed 31 studies on nocebo effects reported a wide range of symptoms that could manifest as nocebo effects including nausea, stomach pains, itching, bloating, depression, sleep problems, loss of appetite, sexual dysfunction and severe hypotension.</p>
<p>I know several doctors who explained to some of my acquaintances "go home, take care, wait a week and everything will be fine". I only know of one guy who made the mistake to go to the emergency room and the stress there afflicted him more than he felt objectively afterwards, like he told us.</p>

        <p>I still wonder about how to proof that without testing, we would not know. Many in the West don't accept "case" numbers from overseas it seems, but there are many countries who stopped caring long ago and they are seemingly through with it.</p>

        <p>Yea they went to the hospital because they would have died from covid otherwise. Also it's the hot spot hospitals  getting filled to capacity and the millions of people dying around the world that caused the world to shut down and had we not shut down many more millions of people would have already died from covid by now.</p>

<p>CDC Mask Studies </p>
<p>"Disposable medical masks (also known as surgical masks) are loose-fitting devices that were designed to be worn by medical personnel to protect accidental contamination of patient wounds, and to protect the wearer against splashes or sprays of bodily fluids. There is limited evidence for their effectiveness in preventing influenza virus transmission either when worn by the infected person for source control or when worn by uninfected persons to reduce exposure. Our systematic review found no significant effect of face masks on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza." </p>

<p>"There is no specific evidence to suggest that the wearing of masks by the mass population has any potential benefit.

<p>"We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection. Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes). The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal. In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic." </p>

        <p>I apologize for coming off as dismissive. I recommend you watch this documentary about a real account of munchausen syndrome by proxy: https://youtu.be/4RJf6ckrtcA . Covid mandates making people "act like they're sick" is not the same as literally convincing them that they are via abuse and gaslighting and treating them with unecessesary medications for sympathy or clout. I see why you would make that comparison but it is absolutely not munchausen syndrome by proxy, not even close. This would be like diagnosing the government with ASPD (Psychopathy) because they vaguely meet the diagnostic criteria.</p>
