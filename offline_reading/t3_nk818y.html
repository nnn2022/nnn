    <strong>Are we becoming what we’re fighting?</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve been pretty active in this sub over the past few months. I’ve expressed my concerns with the vaccine, how the provaxx people have become cultish, how skeptical I am of a rushed vaccine, the motives behind it and the dangers of gene altering vaccines... </p>
<p>I’m currently being downvoted in this sub for asking (so that I can strengthen my argument actually) for links that show the link between the vaccine and permanent damage. Have we become close minded as well? Do we not answer questions that have reasonable answers? Have we become the “believe us without evidence” crowd? The downvote anyone who might ask for proof, type of sub. Pfft... unreal.</p></p>

        <p>Are you presuming these products have been extensively tested? </p>
<p>We're 6 months into rollout. Last week we got our first paper stating scientists have found vaccine originated spike protein in recipient's blood streams. </p>
<p>It was the first study to measure this.</p>
<p>They looked at less than twenty people.</p>
<p>Does that help answer your question?</p>

        <p>The problem is the assumption that there have been studies on brand new vaccines. The trial is on-going. So far, we can say the majority of vaccinated folks are not dropping dead. On the other hand, we can also see folks who themselves proved they'd been recently vaccinated died just after and they were said to have died from "natural causes". </p>
<p>I personally would recommend anyone consider their own individual risk factors and make a decision they are comfortable with. I have not taken a covid vaccine, but I would not hesitate to take a traditional style vaccine, I don't feel my risk from covid warrants me taking an experimental drug that has been untested.</p>

        <p>You say permanent....but at this stage, they are dealing with side effects that may or may not be to do with the vaccine they recently got. Cases are in the stage of 'monitoring and treating recently aquired condition'... but that's the point isn't it? Even manufacturers themselves don't have the information you seek. The current trial finishes in 2023.... this whole roll out is the human trial.</p>

        <p>Yea, its always something to be aware of, its easy to become rightthink vs wrongthink, especially once you've locked in your biases - /r/lockdownskepticism is more curated... I stick around here though, to try to be reasonable across the board... the last couple months this place has become a bit more meme-y and I don't particularly like it, that said, I think that many people are also fairly reasonable here -- its not quite at the level of cultish thats for certain, but the brigading that comes here a lot makes for a lot of people with knee jerk reactions to possibly innocent questions (its hard to figure out a concern troll you know?)</p>
