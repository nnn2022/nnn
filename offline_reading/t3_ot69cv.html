        <p>I think it's horrific insanity that people would ban free speech just because they disagree with a certain viewpoint.  I don't care how vile, repugnant, or rude your ideas and viewpoints may be, I believe you still have the right to say and express them.  Once we start banning one type of speech, more and more things will be added to the 'banned' topics.</p>
<p>Eventually, we'll end up not even being able to express our dislike for something...</p>

<p>In US constitutional law, false statements of facts do not always have 1st amendment protection.</p>
<p>Similarly, there are other limitations to freedom of speech, such as limitations on incitement.</p>
<p>It isn't a matter of disagreement.</p>

        <p>So you're saying the CDC, WHO, UN, FDA, NIH, government agencies, AMA, etc published reports and studies are false? No one on this sub that I have seen is making up false statements or facts... we simple share links to various studies, government data, medical and news releases that are publicly published. Personally, most the info I post is links to CDC reports, which is a government agency disseminating information.</p>
<p>Some of the posts are opinion and thoughts and experiences, as is much of Reddit, which is currently legal to express - otherwise, all social media and communication would be illegal.</p>

        <p>You are the one who said false statements and facts do not have First Amendment protection.  I didn't think you were trying to claim that green beans being disliked is a false fact, so I figured you were referring to this sub as a whole as spreading 'misinformation' - which it doesn't. </p>
<p>So perhaps I misunderstood you.  I was commenting on the original post about freedom of speech, and you brought up the First Amendment.  I think it's pretty obvious Voltaire wasn't talking about screaming 'fire' in a theater or protecting liars.</p>

        <p>I don't use Facebook/Twitter/etc.  Reddit is my only social account.</p>
<p>So I think you are talking about conspiracy theories? It seems weird that Facebook/Twitter would ban that, because isn't it kind of in line with aliens, bigfoot, Illuminati, zombies, DUMBs, contrails, astrology, young earth, etc which is all allowed on social media.  I mean, it  falls under opinion/beliefs - the same as other shunned/disbelieved topics.  I'd like to think people are smart enough to tell opinion from fact - as in whether the info comes from a reputable agency or Joe Blow... and should be able to use critical thinking to figure out their own opinion on a topic.</p>
<p>I actually think they should allow theories as free speech.  Seems like thought police to me, if you are going to stop people from sharing theories and beliefs.  You'd have to make all religions illegal too if sharing beliefs becomes illegal.</p>

        <p>I doubt many (probably 0) people are choosing not to vax because someone told them the vaccine turns them into a tracking device (or any other theory). Most people carry their cell phone with them at all times, which actually IS a tracking device and connects to 5G towers and provides gps data.  So if someone doesn't want to be tracked, they aren't going to carry a cell phone either, which means they are probably not even seeing those comments on social media.</p>
<p>I think the over-whelming majority of people don't vax over health concerns, which have been provided by the CDC, FDA, medical professionals, government agencies, etc.  A smaller number of people don't vax for religious or political reasons.</p>
<p>You would have to ask each person individually why they are not vaccinated - you shouldn't assume to know the answer.  And if people are claiming that unusual beliefs or crazy ideas are affecting vaccination decisions, I'd have to say that's probably a false claim or report.  I'd put that up there with claiming that people aren't vaccinating because they believe it will turn them into werewolves - you'd have to be pretty gullible to believe that's the reasoning.  I think it's pretty stupid if Facebook, or anyone else believes that's the reason too.  I think most non-vaxxers are far too intelligent to fall for Twitter or Facebook claims.</p>
<p>Lol... as if they could just shut down all the 'covid vaccines turn you into a zombie!' claims and everyone will line up for shots.  You'll still have the same number of people who don't want the covid vaccine whether those claims are out there or not.</p>

        <p>The education system continues to get worse every year. Classical education with focuses on rhetoric, reading "the great books", language, and philosophy has already been cast aside for class studies of the Hunger Games. There is no longer critical thinking taught and education will continue this decline as technology improves.</p>

        <p>If parents can't influence their children with their own thoughts and ideas, it leaves space for the government to teach kids what to think. A key part of CRT thats currently being pushed is surveys that monitor home life by having children take surveys about it. The government wants children out of their parents influence and we are losing the people who are willing to fight against this insanity.</p>
