        <p>I don't think 80% of the populace is staying in, however I am not seeing the same number of crowds out that I saw in 2019. I've been going out a lot in the last few months, to malls, to grocery stores, to restaurants, etc. Either due to capacity limits or people just being afraid (or refusing to go out due to masks), I am seeing very few out, especially on Saturdays when there used to be crowds out in these places. I also believe a lot of these people likely do go out, but mostly for food and other "essentials" thus why I see the most clusters of people, even now, at Walmarts, Targets, and other "essential" businesses. I also see a lot of fear in people, even when they are out willingly. Lots of masks, lots of anxiety, and people getting nervous when someone passes by them.</p>

        <p>I think it's partially fear but I think a significant part is why go out with all the restrictions and additionally inertia, some people would have gotten into the habit of not going out and haven't changed course yet. </p>
<p>I'll get takeout instead of eating out just because fuck having to jump through hoops, mask on, mask off 20 times during the course of a meal and then pay extra for the privilege.</p>
<p>One look at the Chicago lakeshore and parks weekend after weekend show that peoples are fatigued and not as afraid anymore.</p>

<p>Like I wrote before, people are out but they still seem to be afraid. Are these people in Chicago wearing masks outdoors? Do they keep their distance from others? Do they jump or dodge incoming strangers?</p>
<p>I have a lakefront near my home as well. There are usually people there, but they are all wearing masks, including the kids with their parents. Moms with strollers dodge people approaching them on the sidewalk. People are standing apart, and not really interacting unless they are in the same group or family.</p>

        <p>At the lake, no one wears masks. It's 50/50 with people walking/running around. People tend to keep their distance but from my perspective, that's more so because you don't know how someone will react versus actually being afraid of catching something.</p>
<p>I think it's hard to tell who wears masks and distances because of Karens / government mandates / social conformity and who wears masks and distances because they're genuinely afraid. As a gambling man, I'd put my money on the former. At least where I live.</p>

        <p>The empty NPCs aren't the ones we need to care about convincing. They'll just go with whatever seems to be popular opinion. If we seized control of the government/media and told them it was over, they'd go along with that just as compliantly as they did with the lockdowns. But if we keep sitting around waiting for the dictators to get bored or whatever the current strategy is, we could be stuck with all of this and worse for a very long time.</p>
