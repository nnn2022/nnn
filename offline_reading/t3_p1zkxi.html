    <strong>University of California Vaccine Mandates</strong>
    <p><p>I have been engaged in a dispute with the University of California, Santa Cruz, regarding their imposition of vaccine mandates upon the student body. I have successfully achieved a religious exemption from the mandate, though it was not without pushback from my end.</p>
<p>Now, being the far-left indoctrination center that UCSC is, my posts in r/ ucsc regarding this subject have been met with intense hate and discrimination regarding my religion and beliefs (ironic, that an institution which "celebrates" "diversity, inclusion and acceptance," would in fact have no room for those qualities when it comes to differing perspectives). My posts have been removed, censored, or muted. I thought I would share with this group the kind of content that results in exclusion from a subreddit dedicated to an academic institution, as well as give this text a home. (Note: this is my first post to this subreddit after spending a month or so as an infatuated observer and participant of discussion. I hope this content is permitted).</p>
<p>From my original post:</p>
<p>"I recently created a post regarding religious exemption/exception for the experimental COVID Vaccines being mandated upon the student populace (and I must mention, the mods removed my post with no explanation, and responses in the comments were filled with hate and bigotry). As a Catholic and a human being with the God-given right to personal autonomy, I personally find this mandate absolutely abhorrent. I must make it clear that I am not inherently opposed to vaccines, though I do believe the individual reserves the right to choose what goes into their body and should not be coerced, manipulated or threatened to lose certain rights and abilities based on something such as vaccination status. Let me say that again: <em>the individual reserves the right to choose what goes into their body and should never be coerced, manipulated or threatened to lose certain rights and abilities based on something such as vaccination status. No matter what.</em></p>
<p>This is not only a deeply held religious belief of mine, but it is in fact the most American belief there is in regards to freedom of personal choice and bodily autonomy. To comply with this mandate would be to surrender ourselves to the most vile government intrusion this nation has observed.</p>
<p>It cannot be denied that the implementation of covid vaccine mandates across the country and world is leading us, as a global people, to a very dark place. If you've been paying attention, you may have noticed massive anti-"vaccine passport" protests rising up across Europe, including in France, Italy, and Lithuania (and now New York City). I applaud these protests. We, as a global people, are actively witnessing or participating in the transformation of a democratic ideal into one of pure authoritarianism, discrimination, hate and tyranny. This global pandemic, which was either leaked or released from a gain-of-function virology laboratory in Wuhan, China, has set a horrid precedent regarding individual liberties and the powers of individuals in government, whether elected or appointed. This virus, the novel covid-19, the seventh known coronavirus to infect man, has become the demise of our great nation. And that is not because of the virus itself, but rather, massive government overreach and over reaction to something that is barely fatal and much less dangerous than it was initially assumed to be. If it isn't apparent to you how covid-19 has been used to control, manipulate, and deceive the American people, I suggest you break free from the cognitive shackles imposed upon you by our national media and government officials. This whole narrative is a farse, they are actively deceiving you to force your compliance.</p>
<p>It is commonly understood that powers given to governments are powers forever lost to that nation's people. There is extensive literature regarding this phenomena. The post-9/11 Patriot Act is a great example. To this day, illusive government agencies are still spying on the American people, breaching their private lives and evading basic privacy rights. The Patriot Act allowed this imposition upon our people's private lives, and it was passed in 2001. 20 years have passed, and they still continue to neglect our privacy rights in the name of national security. It is clear as day: if we continue to allow these government interventions into our personal lives, the destruction of our civil liberties will continue to persist. Our compliance is our submission. Our submission is our demise.</p>
<p>So with this, I am pleased to inform the student body at UCSC: religious exemption is possible for those who do not wish to trade their bodily autonomy for the ability to attend higher education. I have gone through the process, successfully, but with some push-back, I must admit. Be prepared to stand up for what you truly believe in, and you will find support through God. Students of UCSC, if you cannot decide whether or not you will take this vaccine, I urge you: look deep inside of yourself. Trust your intuition. Know that behind each corner lies another deception, a trick, an illusion designed to force your will. Resist the narrative. It is the greatest deception many of us have ever witnessed in our entire lives, and it will continue only so long as we comply. This is merely a test. The government has asked for an inch, and they have taken a mile. And they will continue to do so until we find ourselves in complete submission and subservience to their wicked will.</p>
<p>If you are someone who is considering no longer attending this school due to the mandates imposed by the UC body, please do not hesitate to apply for religious exemption. If you need help through the process, feel free to reach out to me through a PM and I will happily support you through the process.</p>
<p>God bless America. We are one of the final bastions of freedom in the world. And should we continue to comply with the will of the wicked, we may very well see our beloved nation fall into the grips of authoritarianism; medical-tyranny, so to speak. Have faith, my friends. The fight is not over yet."</p>
<p>Now, am I surprised that I was muted and my post removed? Definitely not. Is it a sign of the active attempt to shut down those who speak against this medical tyranny, this ideological hegemony? Absolutely. I am deeply disturbed by the current state of our political and social discourse. As a young man in his early twenties, I must admit that I am quite uncomfortable with the direction our nation and the world is headed. I am also deeply concerned with the willingness of my peer group to conform to the will of the wicked. These are dark times.</p>
<p>My plans for the future, in regards to higher education, were almost completely de-railed by these mandates. I have seen dozens, if not hundreds of posts in this subreddit by people who face a very similar predicament: <em>get the jab, or lose your job, your ability to participate in society, and the respect of your peers.</em> We are not alone. This is affecting hundreds of millions of Americans, and even many more millions of human beings across the world. We must stand up for what we truly believe in, because as far as I am concerned, we are the only thing standing between the state, and full-blown top-down authoritarianism (I refrain from employing the terms fascist or communist here, as I am sure none of us are truly aware as to what the exact qualities and conditions this New World Order will be). The time is now. We are being tested. Hold your will, remain strong. We will resist the New Normal!</p>
<p>(Flared this for Schools, though it could easily be flared as Censorship, Vaccines, Depravity, and more)</p>

        <p>Trust me, as someone who used to work in higher ed at the very start of these mandates, the internal administrative process for implementing these vaccination mandates is a joke.</p>
<p>We literally had student workers in charge of reviewing documents by email and gross mismanagement causing incorrectly inputted dates, missed documents, and frustrating turn around times for students. Administration was not prepared to implement what they decided to carry out. </p>
<p>Universities just want students out of their hair about these mandates. Keep emailing and pushing for an exemption, and throw in a bit about how outrageous tuition is.  They would rather have you off their backs and grant an exemption than deal with too much back and forth.</p>

        <p>I totally believe it. My original exemption request was met with what is clearly a copy-paste response by the UC:</p>
<p>"We acknowledge receipt of you notice stating you are a remote student and <em>will not come to UC property.</em></p>
<p>This is valid until January 2, 2022, or until you email us at ~~med_xxx~~~~@/ucsc~~~~.edu~~ rescinding your status as a person not currently subject to the COVID-19 vaccination policy."</p>
<p>Yes, they essentially threatened me to never step foot on UC campus, while still being required to shovel tens of thousands of dollars for an education. Imagine that level of greed and insolence!</p>
<p>Note that I never applied for remote education, simply religious exemption. And yes, I absolutely pushed back.</p>

        <p>Thank you anonymous stranger! The funny thing is, I haven't even attended class at UC yet. I literally just finished the transfer process from a community college.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, I am very excited to challenge the nonsense being spewed by professors and students at this institution. This is where the fun begins!</p>

        <p>Exact same thing I did here. I will push, and I will push, and I will push again until THEY comply with ME. Listen, they want my money, they want my mind, they want to control and indoctrinate me. All I want is my degree so I can carry on with my life and engage in whatever pursuits I should so choose. If it came to the point where I was completely barred, then to hell with them, they don't deserve my money anyway (and certainly not my mind, but that they will NEVER have). Compliance is submission. Submission is demise.</p>
<p>Edit: The conditions of religious exemption were described, as per the contract of exemption, as indefinite. To nullify or void my status would be contractual violation, and grounds for legal action.</p>
