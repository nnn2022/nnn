    <strong>Don't Stoop To r/CovIdiots Level, Be Civil Not Flippant</strong>
    <p><p>I know it's frustrating when we see illogical posts based on a narrative rather than having a well rounded factual scope.  With that said, I hope that we can maintain better composure than those in the r/CovIdiots sub and other pro mask/lockdown groups.  </p>
<p>I read a post from a doomer in here that used math erroneously as a means to justify Covid measures and immediately it was just downvoted and countered with concise responses which honestly seemed to empower their invalid findings.  </p>
<p>I took the time to look into their data and found that it was completely wrong which I pointed out through real data and math which should be the goal in this group.  </p>
<p>Ultimately, it would be far more productive to have a structured debate with any of the doomers willing to engage because the truth is in the data and if they are presented with a factual counter rather than insult, then we can make progress rather than just having the satisfaction of "winning."  </p>
<p>Don't stoop to their level.  If you are in this subreddit because you've explored the facts, then that is your weapon.</p></p>

        <p>I agree with your sentiment my friend! Absolutely, I think that is most effective, and even morally good - to not stoop to that/"their" level.  </p>
<p>I guess, I feel in myself sometimes, and see in others, valid emotions and reactions based upon the unfortunate reality we find ourselves - a reality that causes such harm and division.... I guess in short - I understand those that speak/respond less tolerantly (I am guilty of it myself on occasion) - it even plays its own role it combating the presented narrative.  </p>
<p>And I fully support your message, it is something we should all strive for - I guess I'm also ok with the harsher stuff coming out at times too.  </p>
<p>Keep fighting the good fight!</p>

        <p>So apply their same logic of "assimilate or die" rather than having a discussion and maybe welcoming them to the group?</p>
