    <strong>Has mainstream media been causing nosophobia?</strong>
    <p><p>This is a short article on nosophobia, or the fear of disease. I think a lot of people who are truly fearful of Covid could be clinically diagnosed, and maybe even require treatment to get over it:
 https://www.healthline.com/health/nosophobia#takeaway</p>
<p>Here are a few highlights:</p>
<p>&rt;Nosophobia is the extreme or irrational fear of developing a disease. This specific phobia is sometimes simply known as disease phobia. </p>
<p>&rt;Nosophobia also involves avoidance. You may not want to know anything at all about the disease. Hearing about it in the news or from others may trigger distress. Or, you might avoid public transportation or spaces, such as grocery stores. </p>
<p>&rt;On the other hand, some people with nosophobia prefer to learn as much as they can about certain diseases. They might spend hours reading about the condition or monitoring the news for stories about potential outbreaks. </p>
<p>&rt;Living through a disease outbreak can also contribute to nosophobia. In these cases, you might be inundated with news footage about the disease or constantly hear about it from friends or coworkers. </p>
<p>&rt;Nosophoboia is typically diagnosed if worry and anxiety about developing a disease makes daily life difficult or has a negative impact on quality of life. </p>
<p>&rt;While specific phobias don’t always require treatment, nosophobia can involve a fear of going anywhere you might be exposed to a certain disease. This can make it difficult to work, go to school, or take care of other needs. </p>
<p>&rt;If your concern about illness focuses on a specific disease and begins to affect your daily life, emotional health, or your ability to function as you usually would, consider reaching out your healthcare provider. Living with extreme fear isn’t easy, but phobias are very treatable.</p></p>

        <p>Yes. My aunt has obsessive compulsive disorder so even during “normal” times she has to clean her doorknobs and glasses and take 45 minutes to wash her hands. She lives in a separate apartment from my Uncle because she can’t deal with people or germs in her safe space. </p>
<p>COVID anxiety made it so that she couldn’t go to work, the fear of the disease was too extreme. None of us have seen her since March 2020. She is in therapy but it makes me extremely angry at the news organizations who did this to people who were most susceptible to the fear mongering.</p>
