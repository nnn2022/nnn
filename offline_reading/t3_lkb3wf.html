    <strong>Cannot believe what I’ve just heard</strong>
    <p><p>So I’m currently at work and I was just with my co-worker as he was picking a few things up from his ex-mrs house, he just moved out over the weekend. As we get there she is leaving to go out, it’s half-term in the UK meaning schools/college’s are off for the week, I forgot and asked why she wasn’t teaching her online class, he told me she was going to get a injection.</p>
<p>Hmm, obviously intrigued I ask him what type, he tells me covid, she’s in her mid 30’s and he never said anything before but he told me she’s considered high risk due to a heart murmur, basically she has a leaky valve. </p>
<p>She already had and beat covid in November last year, he said it was rough for her, she wanted a doctor at one point but she beat it in less than a week, no hospital trip needed, no oxygen, just her fucking immune system and healthy eating while resting. </p>
<p>Now she’s off to get a nice experimental vaccine for a virus she already beat when she has a dodgy ticker, how she thinks this is a good idea I’ll never know, can’t believe people in my country are this brainwashed it’s honestly sad.</p></p>

        <p>That is devastating and unless we both missed something, she from what you've mentioned (if she doesn't have a serious underlying condition) seems like she isn't in a vulnerable demographic either...

        <p>She does have a heart murmur, a leaky valve is what he said so that puts her in the high risk catorgory, if she already beat covid with that and has no after affects or ‘long covid’ as they’re calling it, not a clue why she would decide to get the vaccine.</p>

        <p>I never stated that I spoke to her, this is just what my co-worker told me. If she got offered the jab then I guess they just deemed her high risk enough to recieve her first jab, alongside with her being a school teacher. Not much else I can say.</p>

<p>I had 2 family members in my household test positive, the other two experience symptoms, me nothing. However my family all beat it in a few days because we're all healthy, active adults that don't smoke, aren't overweight and relied on our immune systems which we spent the last year really focusing on keeping to it's best.</p>
<p>I also interact with the public on a daily basis, have got into multiple hospitals and care homes up and down the UK, work and family members positive, all fine and recovered, I wonder how much of your health you really looked after beforehand.</p>

        <p>Are you serious? I know how the virus has affected close friends of mine, and god knows how many millions of people around the planet, job losses, overdose, suicide. These lockdowns are pushing people's mental health to the edge and forcing them into poverty. </p>
<p>Flawed and dangerous you say, well that's exactly what I think of that vaccine, if you seriously think your government has your best interests at heart and cares about your health then you're probably too far gone to convince otherwise. A vaccine pushed in 9 months that you have no idea what the long term affects are is not safe at all, we do know some of the affects right after though and they all seem much worse than everyone I know's experience with testing positive for covid.</p>

        <p>Your paranoia and emotional immaturity feed the credibility of this delusion in your mind and so many others. </p>
<p>I don’t disagree the lockdowns are pushing people into vulnerable emotional and fiscal states, but that is ultimately a long term symptom of our purely capitalistic society. </p>
<p>No lockdowns, no masks, no distancing would have catastrophic large scale consequences simply because of our infrastructure. </p>

        <p>What's more insulting is claiming emotional superiority while stating there is only one option in order to solve this crisis and anyone claiming otherwise is "delusional" and "insensitive." This is not what science is based on at all and to assume our immune systems are useless seems like a pretty big oversight on the government's part. I recommend giving yourself a refresher on the scientific method.</p>
<p>Using this method it is very obvious these measures do not work and that is self evident since we are now a year into "two weeks to flatten the curve." I find being lied to by our "leaders" for the past year much more insulting than what is discussed on this subreddit. People are "acting" like this is malevolence because there doesn't seem to be a clear logic to anything being recommended at this point. But if you look at it from the perspective of dividing everyone using fear of a virus, it begins to make much more sense...</p>
<p>Now please feel free to actually state why you feel we should trust these people in power who have never told us the truth about anything? Or just stick to those sad appeals to emotion and authority.</p>

        <p>Paranoia? Oh the irony, you pro lockdown, pro mask, pro vaccine people are THE MOST paranoid people in existance. I have a million reasons to not trust a vaccine that benefits no one but the company making it and the rich elite.</p>
<p>You say you don't disagree lockdowns cause major issues then try and blame it on capitalism, lockdowns worldwide have destroyed countless lives because of what they do, you can't just blame capitalism lmao.</p>
<p>This just isn't true, states in the USA that aren't following your strict covid rules have not had people dying left right and centre like you claim will happen.</p>
<p>Wow, you seriously believe the governement and the vaccine companies have your best interests at heart and that they are doing this for YOUR benefit. You are so far gone it's sad to see, I'm not a religious man but I do believe there to be higher beings out there and I pray they do something to help you. Like I said originally, you want that vaccine you go out and get it, I'm allowed to refuse just like you are allowed to take it.</p>

        <p>Just be prepared to face the consequences of your refusal for the vaccine in both the public and private sector. </p>

        <p>I learned a decade ago in college chemistry that hangover is inability to perform Krebs cycle due to dehydration and other factors.</p>
<p>Symptoms are how we remove toxins. Removing toxins is the number one priority of our body--this is why we sweat, urinate defecate and expire. When this is not sufficient, the body will add more intense detox mechanisms: sneeze, cough, diarrhea, vomit, skin eruptions, etc.</p>

        <p>I’ve already explained that a pushed 9 month vaccine is in no way guaranteed to be safe, how is this even a debate? 9 fucking months lol, she already beat the virus, she has antibodies, putting a experimental vaccine into her isn’t going to benefit her in anyway.</p>

        <p>Where did I say (or even imply) that?</p>
<p>Everyone should research and think and question their own health choices, absolutely.</p>
<p>Nobody should be arrogant enough to think they know what’s best for their friend’s ex-wife when they don’t even have a passing understanding of her health conditions, nor do they have a passing understanding of why someone might consider getting vaccinated for covid after having covid. The people who could know what’s best for her would be: herself, and her doctors who know her situation. </p>
<p>But thanks for jumping to conclusions and showing your own lack of understanding. Want a lollipop? That must have been hard work.</p>

        <p>No vaccine pushed in 9 months in safe, your government do not have you best interests at heart. If you think this is about them caring for your health you are delusional. </p>
<p>I’ve done my own research and I’ve decided there is no way I’ll be taking an experimental vaccine, you want to then go right ahead. I honestly don’t care. 
You don’t know the long term affects, you also just want everyone to bow down and take a vaccine that’s not guaranteed to be safe, there is so many controversial things surrounding covid and you try and belittle people who question these things and think for themselves. You can’t insult people when you’re the sheep.</p>
