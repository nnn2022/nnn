        <p>Yeah. It's hard for people who don't plan their lives beyond what they're going to eat next to understand that people who have actual wealth and power take larger, more complex actions to increase that wealth and power.  (And to protect that wealth and power.)</p>
<p>This link explains so much, even including why some countries go along with the agenda more than others -- and why some countries have been entirely immune to "Covid-19."</p>
<p>Once the enormity of this information is understood -- suddenly it makes sense that nothing about the Covid response makes sense.</p>
<p>It's all a distraction.</p>
<p>The more we are divided and blame one another - the less likely we are to blame upward.</p>
<p>Mask mandates exist so we'll fight with each other about it ---- and more importantly, so the unmasked (a weak minority) take the blame for the lockdowns instead of the politicians that ordered them.</p>

        <p>i agree - good chance this is strongly involved, plus all of the other motives of institution more ‘veilance and tracking.   I hold out hope that the true rulers of the planet arent just sociopaths, but more control freaks who think they know whats best and fear the general public losing its mind over something like a dollar collapse.  pretty believable story honestly, and like you said, explains why its western globocap aligned countries doing this fapfest</p>

<p>Economic destruction is required to bring in the great reset, but this is only one 'workstream' within the wider program.</p>

        <p>"If I am right guys, in one respect you can breathe a sigh of relief: world tyranny, forced vaccinations with harmful DNA changes, sterilisations, and mass genocide are not the main aims of this ‘operation’. They may be the end result of it, if we are not careful, but I don’t think they are the main aims."</p>
<p>I think the author references the fact that the main reason for this false flag was to cover for the USA financial collapse, but many world leaders are in the know, and their Government overreach is being done for other dubious reasons. Many World Leaders are taking advantage of the ruse to consolidate power and change. </p>
<p>My take away is that the attempt to stop the USA financial collapse has giving unethical world leaders and Billionaires the window of opportunity to scare citizens into giving up their rights out of fear. So when the music stops, we will all be broke and in chains that we made ourselves.</p>

        <p>Isn't the purpose to eventually do away with the dollar as the reserve currency and collapse the banking system to institute some kind of global currency that would allow for much greater control over the whole population though? I don't think the power elite really care all that much about saving the US status as the world power from China, and China's model of social engineering is exactly what they want imposed on the world.</p>

        <p>I think you are missing the main point of this article. It says that the USA and their Allies fabricated a Covid-19 false flag incident to allow them to steal trillions of dollars from US citizens and citizens from other allied countries to give to the banks to forestall the inevitable collapse of the USD.</p>
<p>The Great Reset from the WEF and China want to do away with the US reserve currency but that is not the reason we are in this situation.</p>
<p>And the article speculated that the Great Reset (WEF Style) was meant to sow discord and have everyone fighting for either commies and capitalists. It was a calculated effort brought to you by the US Military Complex and WallStreet trying to maintain the status quo that has given other unscrupulous Governments the chance to steal control from their people.</p>

        <p>I think it was done to put the final nail in the USD reserve currency coffin. A casual look at the decline in the DXY shows that the USD is headed for a massive decline this year and the Biden admin is only going to accelerate the depreciation through increased spending. If you're not holding silver, gold, junior silver and gold mining stocks and possibly platinum group metals, you're going to be in serious trouble. BTW, the banks will all fail and because governments are insolvents, they'll resort to bail-ins (look at Cyprus) where deposits are converted into bank equity without your consultation. Keeping money in the bank in 2021 is unwise. I suspect the banking crisis will start in the UK and spread to Europe before wiping out the US and Japan.</p>

        <p>Outlawing it doesn't work, there is no central body to stop it. Many BTC transactions are used for the black market anyway, all this would do would push all BTC transactions into the black market.  There is zero practical way of outlawing crypto. It might even have the opposite effect that governments wanted, even if all governments globally got together and outlawed all crypto.</p>
<p>Most crypto is fairly resistant to quantum computing attacks and the vulnerabilities that exist, if they are able to be exploited, will not be exploitable for decades.  Even then, there are quantum resistant encryption algorithms that could be employed to fix these if any vulnerabilities did become a concern. Of course, traditional banking is probably even more susceptible to quantum attacks, but I guess you are suggesting going entirely physical, which is also impractical for a lot of people and way more vulnerable than my cold storage BTC are.</p>

        <p>Well, this is certainly some weapons-grade tinfoil.</p>
<p>I do think a lot of this article makes a lot of sense, and is the first good explanation I have seen of why the narrative doesn't seem to line up with reality. The political utility to the US left was a fairly obvious explanation, though it mostly failed to explain why Europe was on board.</p>
<p>It seems extremely unlikely to me that a conspiracy could exist which outright fabricates a non-existent pathogen. I don't see how it could be possible to maintain that ruse. This is 9/11 truther-level conspiracy theory, it's simply impossible to keep that many people quiet - it only takes a handful of subject matter experts to blow the narrative apart. The more likely explanation is that the opportunity simply presented itself naturally, or if you want to go down the nefarious route, was engineered. If you take the hypothesis at face value, we can easily have been in a situation for the last decade of probing for opportunities to exploit a global crisis to implement the same plan.</p>
<p>It's a shame there is such a high degree of speculation that makes this idea completely off-limits to most people. I think the core thesis of an economic coma to rehabilitate the dollar could be presented in a more neutral light. I'm hoping someone can follow up and comment on the soundness of the economic arguments the author presents.</p>

        <p>Economically interesting, but the idea that the virus literally doesn't exist made me stop reading. "non-existent vaccine for a non-existent virus." If this were true, hundreds of millions of virologists would have to be involved in the matter -- we're talking about conspiracy at not only the elite level, but across all hospitals, pharmacies, and people with medical knowledge. This one, wild idea damages the authors ethos pretty heavily in my mind, though the concept of overplaying Covid for economic reasons is a completely reasonable assumption.</p>
