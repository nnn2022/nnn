    <strong>To all the COVID deniers in my county... (San Luis Obispo County, CA)</strong>

<p>You are destroying this country. How dare you try to ask for your freedoms and things that make life worth living when we are in the midst of a PANDEMIC. </p>
<p>Didn’t you know that there have already been almost as many COVID-related deaths in San Luis Obispo County, CA as <a href="http://www.slohealthcounts.org/content/sites/slodph/Infectious-Disease_Community_Health_Assessment_San_Luis_Obispo_County_July2018.pdf">flu deaths</a> yearly?! Yeah, and it’s WAY more than half the number of yearly deaths to <a href="https://www.livestories.com/statistics/california/san-luis-obispo-county-suicide-deaths-mortality">suicides</a> here too.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.emergencyslo.org/en/covid19.aspx">35</a> of the nearly <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/sanluisobispocountycalifornia">300,000</a> people here have already died WITH coronavirus! To put that in perspective, around <a href="https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/Departments/Health-Agency/Public-Health/Forms-Documents/Data-Reports/Other-Reports/PH-Report_Leading-Causes-of-Accidental-Death-in-SL.pdf%22%20%5Cl%20%22:~:text=The%20top%20causes%20of%20accidental,-39%20and%2050-69.">50</a> people in SLO die due to car crashes yearly and <a href="https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/Departments/Health-Agency/Public-Health/Forms-Documents/Data-Reports/Other-Reports/PH-Report_Leading-Causes-of-Accidental-Death-in-SL.pdf%22%20%5Cl%20%22:~:text=The%20top%20causes%20of%20accidental,-39%20and%2050-69.">20</a> to accidental falling, so COVID is quite a threat. You should stop walking and driving for your protection too.</p>
<p>And why don’t you antimaskers just absolutely fear the thought of our hospitals being overrun like the media tells you to?? <a href="https://www.emergencyslo.org/en/covid19.aspx">13 out of the 400 beds</a> in SLO are being used by patients who tested positive for COVID, so it’s getting really close.</p>
<p>With a whopping <a href="https://www.emergencyslo.org/en/covid19.aspx">0 COVID deaths under the age of 29</a> in this county, you think Cal Poly University would have the common sense to expel anyone that tries to take care of their mental wellbeing by socializing with more than a few people. Considering <a href="https://people.com/health/1-in-4-young-adults-considered-suicide-coronavirus-pandemic/">1 in 4 young adults are seriously considering suicide</a>, I think the best thing we can do to ensure the future success of SLO County is demonizing<a href="https://mustangnews.net/61-cal-poly-students-confess-to-attending-pirates-cove-gathering-last-weekend/"> kids</a> for interacting with others, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/fairfax-schools-more-failing-grades/2020/11/24/1ac2412e-2e34-11eb-96c2-aac3f162215d_story.html">destroy their education</a> and <a href="https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2020/10/29/Mental-physical-health-has-suffered-during-pandemic-lockdowns/5871604010980/">overall health</a>, and <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.566886/full">dehumanize</a> them with a face muzzle.</p>
<p>I for one think we should <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/16/yelp-data-shows-60percent-of-business-closures-due-to-the-coronavirus-pandemic-are-now-permanent.html">close more businesses down</a> and <a href="https://www.oecd.org/education/The-economic-impacts-of-coronavirus-covid-19-learning-losses.pdf">destroy even more the future of our youth</a> with a stricter lockdown. I just can’t believe some people here DON’T want to cause the <a href="https://blogs.imf.org/2020/04/14/the-great-lockdown-worst-economic-downturn-since-the-great-depression/">worst economic downturn</a> since the Great Depression for something that kills a little more than yearly <a href="https://www.slocounty.ca.gov/Departments/Health-Agency/Public-Health/Forms-Documents/Data-Reports/Other-Reports/PH-Report_Leading-Causes-of-Accidental-Death-in-SL.pdf%22%20%5Cl%20%22:~:text=The%20top%20causes%20of%20accidental,-39%20and%2050-69.">accidental poisonings</a> here!</p>
<p>Yeah COVID deaths <a href="https://imgur.com/a/z4v3NUi">aren’t correlating</a> with new “cases” but let’s not talk about that. Also don’t speak about the up to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html">90% false positive rate</a> with testing because if we just test more people that should go down right?</p>
<p>With every death being listed as a <a href="https://fox40jackson.com/headlines/birx-says-government-is-classifying-all-deaths-of-patients-with-coronavirus-as-covid-19-deaths-regardless-of-cause/">COVID death</a> if they had a positive test (or just <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/coronavirus/Alert-2-New-ICD-code-introduced-for-COVID-19-deaths.pdf?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">similar symptoms</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/cdc-wants-states-to-count-probable-coronavirus-cases-and-deaths-but-most-arent-doing-it/2020/06/07/4aac9a58-9d0a-11ea-b60c-3be060a4f8e1_story.html">in most states</a>), regardless of the actual cause of death, I think the <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/%22%20%5Cl%20%22cases_casesper100klast7days">260k</a> US COVID deaths that they shove down our throats is a GROSS underestimate. At least the government <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/04/24/fact-check-medicare-hospitals-paid-more-covid-19-patients-coronavirus/3000638001/">pays hospitals</a>, who are <a href="https://spectrumnews1.com/oh/dayton/news/2020/08/30/independent-hospitals-financially-struggling-during-pandemic">struggling</a> financially due to patients being too scared to come in, extra money to list patients as COVID positive to get a more accurate count.</p>
<p>Don’t you get it, this virus is so infectious that around <a href="https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-cdc-herd-immunity-united-states-a39cfef9-109e-4700-abd4-5a4d5c2eb952.html">10% of America</a> has been exposed to it. That’s 1 more percent than 9 and <a href="https://www.singlecare.com/blog/flu-statistics-infographic/%22%20%5Cl%20%22:~:text=The%20reason%20you%20hear%20so,every%20other%20year%20on%20average.">HALF</a> as infectious as a bad flu season! So everyone make sure to shield your facial expressions and cover up any human dignity you have left with a piece of cloth, because that will SAVE LIVES. Can’t you tell by the number of cases since countries <a href="https://imgur.com/a/laboK2h">mandated masks</a> that they work? And no I don’t care that my God <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLNBw7XCM4Q&amp;feature=emb_title">Anthony Fauci</a> and the <a href="https://twitter.com/surgeon_general/status/1233725785283932160?lang=en">US Surgeon General</a> said masks are pointless earlier this year because the media tells me there’s new “science” :).</p>
<p>Speaking of masks and tyrannical things that cause irreparable <a href="https://www.cugmhp.org/five-on-friday/why-a-mask-is-not-just-a-mask/">psychological</a> harm on society, I think we should do more to delay the inevitable spread of the virus- like maybe <a href="https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-news/covid-19-how-will-minnesotas-ban-on-social-gatherings-be-enforced">ban all gatherings</a>! The virus won’t go away without herd immunity, so if we can delay the spread until the all mighty vaccine gets taken by nearly everyone, we’re only looking at over <a href="https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20201022/fauci-masks-social-distancing-likely-until-2022">1-2 more years</a> of living like inhuman slaves! Say goodbye to weddings, funerals, birthdays, holidays, parties, concerts, churches, bars, gyms, and restaurants so that we can all LIVE.</p>
<p>I’m not stupid. I just blindly trust big pharma, the media, and politicians because they know what’s best for me more than I do and have a very good track record of not being corrupt. Yeah vulnerable people like grandma could just stay home if she wants to, but then how else would our Lord and Savior Bill Gates push his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/23/world/bill-gates-vaccine-coronavirus.html">global vaccine agenda</a>?</p>
<p>Sure good ol’ Bill might have said he wants to use vaccines to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfstBe1buaA">reduce the population</a>, but I’m sure a ruthless tech CEO that does secret “philanthropy” with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/12/business/jeffrey-epstein-bill-gates.html">Jeffrey Epstein</a> only has our best interest in mind. Crazy he <a href="https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/">ran a simulation</a> of a coronavirus outbreak with key players that are involved in what’s currently happening just months before this all started! It was literally like exactly what’s happening and now Bill is a top spokesperson for COVID with no medical background. Gosh coincidences are crazy.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, please don’t research the quacks from Harvard, Stanford, Yale, Oxford, and other top prestigious universities that signed <a href="https://gbdeclaration.org/">The Great Barrington Declaration</a> because that is a major threat to our democracy. Please don’t question SCIENCE, or look into the censorship, lack of debate, and the trouble health leaders have speaking/publishing against the mainstream narrative on this.</p>
<p>I just can’t wait until this <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/why-rushing-a-covid-19-vaccine-by-november-could-be-dangerous%22%20%5Cl%20%22CDC-asks-states-to-prepare-for-vaccine">rushed</a> and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/11/23/success-pfizer-moderna-mrna-covid-19-vaccines-ushers-new-era/6311228002/">new</a> type of vaccine (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/23/covid-vaccine-cdc-should-warn-people-the-side-effects-from-shots-wont-be-walk-in-the-park-.html">that has serious side effects</a>) comes out so I can still be forced to wear a mask and social distance like the “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/coronavirusfrontlines/2020/10/20/why-youll-still-need-to-wear-a-mask-even-after-covid-19-vaccines-arrive/?sh=169f1f175a42">experts</a>” are telling us will happen for years to come. Sucks to be part of the over 100 MILLION people that will starve, go into poverty, kill themselves, get mental disorders, miss cancer screens/vital health visits, or overdose due to the side effects of lockdown restrictions worldwide. I’m just so glad we could save lives.</p></p>
