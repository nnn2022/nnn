    <strong>How do you deal with mask obligation ?</strong>
    <p><p>Hi, fellow siblings-in-mind. </p>
<p>I was offered a job in Guatemala. Being from Central Europe, I thought that you have more freedom in developing countries.</p>
<p>However, I may had been wrong. I found out that this country requires to wear a mask outside at all times.</p>
<p>I detest wearing a mask. </p>
<p>Question: How could that been dealt with if you live in such a place? Someone experience(d) this?</p></p>

        <p>I retired. I realize this won't work for everyone, but I wasn't willing to go through all the idiotic theater that I knew was bullshit. </p>
<p>Masks at all times, even alone outside. Bleaching common areas 3 times a day (except weekends, I guess Fauci Flu takes weekends off), Making people go outside in the cold rain if I had to enter their home, bleaching anything I touched. (Wearing gloves) Wiping down stair rails &amp; mailboxes with bleach. (in the rain)</p>
