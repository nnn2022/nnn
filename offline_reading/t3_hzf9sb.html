        <p>More like "yet another doctor speaks out against lockdown"...</p>
<p>These doctors have been saying this, since March. Nobody's listening to them.</p>

        <p>I think Dr. Immanuel will get a lot of attention from this video:
 https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/hzala9/brave_doctors_are_starting_to_speak_up_recently/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share</p>
<p>She'll get tons more attention than this guy who is rational and calm and reasonable. </p>
<p>I've already seen people calling her a quack. That's the first thing that's done when a doctor speaks the truth that goes against the narrative. I looked further into it and those allegations of her being a quack have been disproven.</p>
<p>I know there's a lot of defeatist attitude around this. I believe that there's growing support against lockdowns and against the MSM fear-mongering. People I talk to in real life dismiss all this. Even people who have been pro lockdown are questioning it.</p>
<p>It doesn't happen overnight. I just keep sharing this information that I find with my group of friends and hope it keeps growing wider and wider and wider. </p>
<p>We're in the middle of an information war. All I can do is fight the fight where I can.</p>

        <p>I was on board with the lockdown at first. At some point I questioned.</p>
<p>More people have joined these antilockdown subs since I did. The numbers grow. </p>
<p>I know it's exhausting. I feel less exhausted because I'm able to go out, go to work, got skating, see my friends and live as normally as possible.</p>
<p>I hope you're able to have some normalcy or find some. I know I had weeks where I was in darkness and depression. Not saying you are, but just saying I know this is a terrible time and I'm not trying to minimize that.</p>

        <p>She says that problems in your marriage (among other things) are due to you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=305&amp;v=CJrJG9xymts&amp;feature=emb_logo">having dream sex with demons and witches</a>. That's not from some 3rd party MSM site. That's her youtube channel. </p>
<p>Why would anyone take any advice from her, much less medical advice?</p>

        <p>Well, I did not see that. I agree. Those are some crazy ideas. </p>
<p>I don't take advice from her, so we agree on that. I think she will be the one to get all the attention because she's over the top. I do hope, but suspect people will use her to discredit the entire group. Look at the rest of the doctors in that group. </p>
<p>Not nearly as many people will watch this video I posted because there's no one yelling about fake news or making accusations.</p>

        <p>How many of us know doctors who are dissenting of this madness? I know at least two who think the mask mandates are ridiculous. They are quiet about it, though, perhaps afraid of consequences for their career.</p>

        <p>In my country we have 2 of them which are giving weekly interviews. One has worked for years in Africa and said Corona is bullshit compared to what he saw. 
The other is the head of the child ward in the National Hospital of Infectious Diseases. He was even appointed as an advisor to the PM. He wanted the Swedish approach and was fired after arguments between him the leader of the response, a military surgeon. He was even tried for spreading lies, but the medical community defended him.
Mass media is really trying to shrug them under the rug for months, but to no avail.</p>

        <p>What he says is interesting... right up until he claims that contact tracing is socialism, claims that there's no data regarding the efficacy of masks, and claims that masks "prevent the transmission of passive immunity." Passive immunity is the transmission of antibodies from a mother to a newborn. I do not understand how that's related to me wearing a mask.</p>
<p>He does not mention anything about the ages or comorbidities of the people he's treated.  If he treated 75 25 year olds you would absolutely expect all of them to stay out of the hospital. The hospitalization rate for that age bracket is less than 1 in 100. There's no data here, just an anecdote from one (two if you count the doctor he mentions) doctor.</p>
<p>Likening this virus to SARS and MERS and claiming that COVID will die out like they did shows an extreme lack of understanding about how these viruses spread. A patient infected SARS or MERS only become significantly contagious <em>after</em> they're showing symptoms. Patients with COVID are most infectious <em>before</em> they feel ill (which, incidentally, is why taking temperatures at the door is just so much hygiene theatre). As a consequence, COVID can spread far and wide before anyone knows they're ill. And that ignores asymptomatic transmission.</p>
<p>Treating early absolutely has merit. I've seen many doctors advocating for the taking of zinc in lozenge form, as well as getting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5aCePGyOgg">Vitamin D</a> to reasonable blood serum levels <em><a href="https://youtu.be/H1LHgyfPPQ8?t=431">for months</a></em>. (It seems extremely suspicious that blacks and hispanics are at much higher risk of contracting COVID and having worse outcomes while at the same time having much higher rates of Vitamin D deficiency. Social issues likely play some factor, but to the degree we're seeing seems unlikely.) But he seems to be wanting to sell a regime that he came up with without having widespread controlled testing across a wide selection of patient profiles as a miracle cure that will make the pandemic "end in a couple of weeks and never return." Maybe it helps and maybe it doesn't, but to claim that it'll make everything just go away... that's just more magical thinking.</p>
