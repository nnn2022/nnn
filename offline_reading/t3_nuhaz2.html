    <strong>The people who used to decry institutional sexism in healthcare are the same ones that now dismiss women's COVID vaccine concerns as hormones/mental illness/hysteria</strong>
    <p><p>Mere months ago, many of those on the liberal side were decrying how women often are not listened to by their healthcare providers. </p>
<p>They would talk on-and-on about how women present with issues and are completely dismissed by their (usually male) doctors, who then misdiagnose them and do not provide adequate treatment. </p>
<p>They would talk at length about how medicine often skips over womens' issues, and research tends to not investigate how treatments affect womens' bodily functions (especially with regards to the female-exclusive aspects of the reproductive and endocrine systems.) </p>
<p>They would bemoan the substandard treatment that women often receive when going to seek healthcare, and provide endless lists of evidence indicating that women's concerns with regards to their health are just not taken into account. </p>
<p>They would share anecdotes about how they went into a doctor's office with terrible symptoms, only to have the doctor treat them like an overreacting child who needed to shut up and quit complaining about nothing (which usually led to a negative outcome.) </p>
<p>These folks would bleat on and on about how the healthcare industry needs to change, and how women are being actively harmed as a result of their health concerns being labeled as hormones/mental illness. </p>
<p>Where are those folks now? </p>
<p>They are the ones screeching to get a shot, saying that nothing bad could ever happen as a result, and that any woman who is concerned about how they will affect (or have affected) her is hysterical (and I use that word intentionally, due to the historical context of it.) </p>
<p>If women who have been vaccinated post anecdotes about impaired fertility, menstrual irregularities, or other side effects, they are often dismissed and told that nebulous "hormones," "stress," or "anxiety" are responsible for the changes. </p>
<p>This 18th century pseudoscientific garbage needs to be called out for what it is. </p>
<p>It is a return to mislabeling women's health concerns as "hysteria" and treating them as if they are a child subject to the whims of their hormones and supposed neuroses. </p>
<p>It is a paternalistic view that removes womens' agency and claims that they couldn't possibly know "what is best for them" due to their "inferior mental condition." We have seen this before; this is not a new belief.</p>
<p>Does "anxiety" cause a woman to immediately bleed out large chunks and have a month-long period post-vaxx when that has never been normal for her before? </p>
<p>Is it "stress?" If so, why is it also happening to women that wanted to get vaccinated and felt relieved afterwards? </p>
<p>If it is "hormonal," then what specific hormones are affected, and why? Furthermore, why do other vaccines not usually have these side effects? What is the treatment, and what will restore hormonal balance? </p>
<p>If these questions cannot be answered, why were there not more tests before pushing this vaccine onto the general public, roughly half of whom are female? </p>
<p>Half of the population cannot give informed consent until they know how and why it would affect some of their most important bodily systems. </p>
<p>If women express concerns about how the vaccine might affect their bodily systems, they are shouted down, called conspiracy theorists, and belittled for questioning whether or not the healthcare institutions that have traditionally failed them are doing so again this time. </p>
<p>"Safe and effective!" "Safe and effective!" "Safe and effective!" is all they hear. </p>
<p>It is quite ironic that the folks who used to decry this institutional sexism are now responsible for perpetrating it themselves. By dismissing womens' health concerns over the vaccine, they are doing the exact thing they used to protest.  </p>
<p>This can all be related to my last post about COVID cultists, and why they care so much about "empathy" and "grandma" yet seem to not acknowledge that anyone else might suffer as a result of forced or coerced sacrifice to save those perceived as weak and oppressed. </p>
<p>These liberal-minded folks never truly cared about women being mistreated by the healthcare system. </p>
<p>They only championed their cause because they historically have viewed women as weak, oppressed children who are being harmed by powerful white male-dominated institutions. </p>
<p>Now that these same women are truly taking agency over their bodies (and questioning the narrative around pandemic measures is a "conservative" (and therefore privileged) position,) the liberals who used to advocate for women have turned on them. </p>
<p>Now, a woman who questions whether there is enough data with regards to the vaccine and womens' issues is belittled, dismissed, and called some variation of conspiracy theorist. </p>
<p>They are no longer part of the "oppressed" class to these liberals, as they are taking control over their own life/healthcare decisions and are no longer dependent on a paternalistic figure to take care of them. </p>
<p>Now, these women are the oppressors - granny killers, the lot of them. </p>
<p>If a young woman with no preexisting conditions decides that it is not wise to risk her health and/or fertility to get vaccinated for a disease that statistically is harmless to her, she faces the indignant wrath of the liberal hivemind. </p>
<p>This is all ridiculous, and the fact that these responses to womens' concerns are widely condoned is disgusting. </p>
<p>The next time you see a response dismissing a woman's reaction to (or concerns over) a COVID vaccine, tell them what I have said. </p>
<p>Call them out on the fact that they are repeating 18th century pseudoscience about women being "hysterical."</p></p>

<p>Well said.  </p>
<p>I have made the same observation, and I completely agree.  </p>
<p>Although, I have gotten exactly zero traction with this in my circles.  Nobody cares what a man says about women's health.  It is immediately dismissed, and the man bringing forward the opinion that "women would be allowed to decide from themselves" gets thoroughly ridiculed by the rabid liberal intelligentsia who, as you said, use the exact same techniques they themselves have been decrying for decades.</p>

        <p>Yes. It sucks. They gaslight women who are having menstrual problems and lie to women who are scared. Before I made a decision on the vaccine, I was doing a lot of research on how the vaccine affects menstrual cycles and no one had answers. Every article admitted that “experts” don’t know what’s causing the abnormal periods but that it’s “completely safe” to take. It makes no sense. I already have incredibly difficult periods, and if the vaccine were to make my period any heavier, I would have to get medical help. It’s frustrating that scientist don’t have answers but are still pushing the vaccine. And it’s a shame that pro-vaxxers berate others for not wanting to put things into their body. Every serious side effect we’ve learned about has been in hindsight. I fear for the young girls in the midst of puberty who are being encouraged to take it. Their bodies are in a far too sensitive stage to risk anything.</p>

        <p>I wrote this post after hearing several of the women in my life talk about their experiences regarding vaccines. Bear in mind that I am male myself, so I cannot comment from a firsthand perspective. </p>
<p>Every one of them has been pressured to get the vaccine immediately without waiting to see longitudinal studies regarding safety or implications. Even the ones who are pregnant or struggling with fertility have been bullied over it. </p>
<p>Be it from acquaintances, doctors, media, etc., they have all been pressured pretty much nonstop after they admit to not being vaccinated. They have talked about the gaslighting as well, and I'm glad that you mentioned it, as I didn't include it in my OP.</p>
<p>There is zero care as to whether or not the woman/girl is safe, either in the short term or the long term.</p>
<p>If she were to lose her fertility or health as a result of vaccination, the people who coerced her into getting the shot would claim that they didn't know it was a possibility (and therefore cannot be blamed,) and that even if they did, it was a necessary sacrifice for the "greater good."</p>
<p>If they don't know what it does to womens' reproductive/endocrine systems and why, then why the hell are they coercing/forcing women to get it? </p>
<p>It is because they simply do not care about women that ask questions and think for themselves. </p>
<p>The women I know have told me repeatedly that their concerns are dismissed and they are talked down to like children when they question whether or not they need this vaccine. </p>
<p>That disgusts me. I don't want the women I care about to be used as pawns in some sick game being played by people that already have far too much power. </p>
<p>Like you said, many women already have concerns over the functioning of their reproductive/endocrine systems. Until they definitively can say what the level of risk is from this shot, they cannot ethically say that anyone should take it. </p>
<p>This is not fair to do to women. This whole thing is just flat-out wrong.</p>

        <p>Everything surrounding these vaccinations is so wrong. They really want you to just shut up and take it. I’m unfazed by the gov and corporations pushing it on people, but I’m deeply disturbed by the fact that they’ve somehow turned people against one another. I’m bothered by doctors who are lying to their patient’s faces. I’ve known for awhile that good doctors are few and far between, but how could you blatantly lie to a woman about how a vaccine affects her fertility? There’s no correlation between the vaccine and infertility because we literally do not have the long-term data, but the government, doctors, and society have just shrugged their shoulders. It’s the lying, coercion, and character assassination that’s driving me insane.</p>

        <p>I had Covid-19 last July. Almost a year later, I have perimenopause symptoms. I'm 36 years old. My hair is thinning, my period is nearly gone, my libido has completely died. I'm miserable about it.   </p>
<p>I would not be the least bit surprised if the vaccine causes the same issues as the actual virus. I had a friend who had her period for a month straight. Another had hers disappear since the vaccine she got 2 months ago. </p>
<p>I know I have antibodies, I'm not getting the vaccine, but man do people make me feel like garbage when I say I'm not getting vaccinated (neither are my daughters, sons, or husband). </p>
<p>And don't forget the new "it makes your long hauler symptoms get better or completely go away!" bullshit they are feeding us now. Why would I risk a vaccine from a virus I survived? I'll deal with my long term symptoms other ways.</p>

        <p>Women's advocates and groups never cared about women and always cared about agenda.</p>
<p>They routinely sided with sexual predators if they were of a certain party.</p>

        <p>I would agree. </p>
<p>It seems that Kaczynski was right: pretty much every liberal identity-based issue boils down to the liberal associating certain groups with being "weak (women), defeated (Native Americans), repellant (LGBT), or otherwise inferior" and in need of protection from a paternalistic government.</p>
<p>Liberals do not care about any of those groups. I explained the situation with women in my OP, and I have posted about it in general on here before.</p>
<p>As soon as members of those groups say "hey, I don't need the government to treat me like a child that knows what I need better than I do," they lose their morally-righteous victim status. </p>
<p>The liberal only cares about those who are perceived as weak and incapable - to them, the only way to truly be moral is to be dependent on a powerful government run by those perceived to be the most oppressed. </p>
<p>As a corollary, to the liberal, perceived strength and capability should be punished. Being self-sufficient is a sin in that ideology.</p>
<p>Nobody should ever trust anyone who adheres to a stance like that. </p>
<p>It is a toxic one that fosters dependence and paves the way for horribly evil people to have an insane amount of control over the lives of others, as we are currently seeing happen with the response to the pandemic.</p>
<p>However, that mindset is the prevailing one when it comes to the COVID Era. The media does an excellent job at spreading that propaganda.</p>

        <p>Actually - it goes further than that - I am currently researching more, but happy to share as I get further into it, but here are some facts: </p>
<ul>
<li>covid-19 binds to the angiotensin cleaving enzyme (type 2) - aka the ACE2 receptor (in case you wanted to know what ACE2 meant)</li>
<li>the spike protein when circulating the body will also bind to that same receptor - this causes less of those receptors to be available to regulate Angiotensin II (its second form) - which is normally converted to Angiotensin I by the ace2 receptor</li>
<li>both male testes and female ovaries have very high numbers of these receptors</li>
<li>in both cases - covid or vaccine - there are hints that it damages the reproductive system (how much isn't quite clear) :</li>
<li>in males it is shown that the Luteinizing hormone becomes elevated but testosterone remains the same - this is an indicator of hypogonadism - or a sign of reproductive troubles in males</li>
<li>in females the reports that I've seen and heard first hand - the behavior of their menstrual cycles is indicative of perimenopause</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, both the testes and the ovaries have high expression of the ace2 receptor - it is not completely known all of the functionality or purpose of the angiotensin cycle in the reproductive system (we seem to know a lot of it, but the fact of so many receptors appears to still be alluded to in literature as a bit of a mystery - if anyone knows more than me please share), not sure if it repairs itself or not in this case, but it is something that is a valid concern - I plan to share the research and findings (from my readings once I am good for it) </p>
<p>One thing for sure though: vaccine boosters would likely continue to damage the reproductive system for each shot given</p>

        <p>sure thing - I'm not done researching this but here is some I've been reading (I've wanted to educate myself further before really putting something together): 
testes research: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314215/
https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2020.574761/full
ovaries research: 
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9237079/
https://academic.oup.com/endo/article/144/5/1942/2502370
https://academic.oup.com/molehr/article/26/6/367/5828941?login=true</p>
<p>One thing I really found interesting is that the spike protein being expressed on an infected cell encourages it to merge into neighbor cells - which ultimately causes damage --- i wonder if that happens when the spike protein alone binds to the cell.</p>

        <p>I'm going to respond in reverse order since I think we can quickly discard the second one: </p>
<p>Study 2 that you shared here has statistical variance nearly the size of the findings - nor does it address anything relevant to ace2 - mostly just looking at the health of oocytes which is mostly irrelevant to the RAS pathway in reproductive health: </p>
<p>&rt;Various outcomes of the IVF cycle were found to be not significantly different before and after vaccination, such as the number of oocytes retrieved (7.1 ±5.2 vs. 8.0 ±6.8, p=0.2), the number of mature oocytes (5.6 ±4.8 vs. 6.6 ±6.3, p=0.1) and the fertilization rate (63.7±30.2 vs. 54.6 ±28.6, p=0.2). In addition, embryos parameters were assessed and no significant differences were found between the number of cleavage embryos (3.4 ±3.3 vs. 3.8 ±4.3, p=0.5) and the number of good and fair embryos (2.5 ±2.9 vs. 3.1 ±3.6, p=0.3) before and after vaccination.</p>
<p>I wouldn't say that result is anything but inconclusive -- look at that variance - much too large to make a conclusion in either direction i would say - but again this study doesn't investigate anything relevant to the ACE2 receptor pathways - oocyte health is irrelevant to the type of reproductive harm potentially possible here, namely ovary function - if its not functioning properly then you could have plenty of healthy eggs and still become infertile if the hormone signalling pathways are damaged - specifically the damage would be in hormone signalling pathways in general</p>
<p>Study 1 is more interesting and does look at hormone levels (which is relevant to the RAS pathway in ace2 receptor signalling) - first thing that sticks out to me is that both the disease and the vaccine group have elevated levels of both progesterone and estradiol compared to the control group initially - unfortunately the author appears to overlook it or finds it statistically irrelevant ... I find it intriguing because that would be (as I have been reading) potentially relevant - though still inconclusive because it just isn't enough information.  </p>
<p>Although these studies appear well intentioned I doubt thoroughly that oocyte health is going to be the largest indicator of an issue here, and so I think that both of these studies generally miss the mark a bit, study 1 does look at steroidogenesis briefly but then quickly goes back to oocyte health - as I have been reading, the largest concern that I would have are regarding the cells in the reproductive system responsible for female/male hormone production becoming damaged by either covid-19 or vaccine -- basically the most likely approach to this would be to have a study that considers these cells health prior to and after infection or vaccine. </p>
<p>It is clear from my personal experience talking to vaccine recipients that the vaccine does in fact affect the reproductive system (obvious in females, but if it is affecting females, there exists a very similar system in males) - but to what effect is not yet clear - I am still working to understand some of the significance of the RAS pathway in general regarding the human reproductive system, so I am not ready to reach a particular conclusion yet, but here are some questions I am hoping to answer:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does the pathogenicity of the spike protein in the vaccine affect the reproductive system in the same way it has been seen to be affected by covid 19?</li>
<li>Is the reproductive health generally restored after damage? Is that damage cumulative? --- The cumulative question is really important - whereas demonstrating immunity should prevent further damage, a vaccine booster given semi-annually or annually would likely cause damage each time assuming question 1 is answered in the affirmative</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm still not ready to reach a full conclusion yet and have read a variety of studies, but in the end it may require a study focused exclusively on this, which is hopefully what University of Illinois is doing regarding seeking vaccine recipients with strange fluxuations in their cycle post vaccination</p>

        <p>Thank you for the informative reply.</p>
<p>Based on your current understanding, what is the safer option? To vaccinate, or to be exposed to the virus?</p>
<p>As far as I am aware, there is no epidemic of infertility in women who had covid--this would have been apparent this late into the pandemic, I would think. So if there are issues with fertility associated with the spike protein, I assume they are very rare. Unless there is something unusual going on with the spike protein in the vaccines which would make it behave differently, it seems to me the effects of the vaccine (from the spike protein) on fertility shouldn't be worse than they are in covid.</p>

        <p>In my layman perspective, it would appear to me that there is likely some damage (to what extent I have no idea) to the reproductive system that is related to the impairment of the ace2 receptor in either case - I would think that the body ought to repair itself, but reproductive systems can be strange in that regard sometimes (so I'm confident but not 100% confident of reproductive repair). Now, that said, which is better? vaccine or infection? My biggest concern would be cumulative damage related to repeated spike protein injection (boosters) though not necessarily 1st/2nd dose of the vaccine alone - and I very much think that innoculation during pregnancy or someone attempting to get pregnant should be avoided (again because it is apparent that the ace2 pathway becomes disrupted and possible cell damage resulting in fluctuating hormone levels that could cause miscarriage) - That said, active covid results in cellular destruction WITH ace2 disruption whereas the vaccine will be causing cellular ace2 disruption alone (some studies suggest mitochondrial interruption meaning cell death - but the spike protein doesn't continue to replicate like covid does) So in this case vaccine or covid its not entirely clear, more data needs to be available on the pathogenicity of the spike protein in isolate - especially in reproductive organs. </p>
<p>ALL OF THAT SAID, if you account for boosters and assume that the damage could be cumulative (maybe the repair isn't as effective over time) I would be very avoidant of taking boosters particularly until more data came out on the spike protein damage to reproductive tissue / long term hormonal impairment - It appears in the literature that there is a lot of infertility problems based on the angiotensin pathways - though infertility is usually caused by ace1 issues not ace2 issues (but ace2 issues do cause hormonal issues that affect fertility certainly - you just aren't by fact infertile) does this all make sense? </p>
<p>TL;DR: covid or vaccine - unclear. Covid is more damaging but a one time event and vaccine damage isn't yet elucidated - but vaccine boosters are the most concerning overall</p>
<p>Hope that helps sorry if its convoluted, its tricky and difficult to weigh risks with so many unknowns (THIS FACT BEING WHY WE SHOULDN'T BE SO ADAMANT IN RUSHING EVERYONE INTO THIS EXPERIMENTAL VACCINE, you know?)</p>

        <p>Thank you, again. Obviously, I am a lay person, and this is awfully complicated, and I don't know whether you are even qualified to make these judgments, so I am taking everything you say with a grain of salt--but what you say <em>seems</em> informed and sane, so these are some very useful data points.</p>

        <p>I have been researching this thoroughly - I have a background in cellular biology - but I am not a doctor, researcher or virologist - so please don't take my word for absolute granted. That study at face value is actually reassuring but one thing that I am concerned with in the study is the following part: 
&rt;The registry data are preliminary, are from a small sample, and describe mostly neonatal outcomes from third-trimester vaccination;</p>
<p>So it doesn't very accurately measure 1st and 2nd trimester </p>
<p>Also - assuming my theory is correct covid19 is also a huge threat to pregnant women and this nature article is worrying:

        <p>I took a quick look at the paper (skimmed through it) - I see the paper mostly focused on measuring antibody assays (not exactly the same) -- is there a part that I am missing discussing the difficulty in measuring spike protein? The closest thing I have (though I can't find the paper I am ACTUALLY looking for) is a copy of an animal study in japanese:

        <p>It’s not really that surprising though - the lysis by the immune system frees those proteins - I am a bit surprised it was found in the blood as I’d expect the lymphatic system to transport them but it has been documented already - I would surmise that it’s related to the fact that there’s no way the mRNA doesn’t get into the blood stream at some level during injection</p>

<p>It is present, like other cell contents and junk in exceedingly low levels, that are cleared rapidly after vaccination and that they had to invent a completely new method be able to detect.</p>
<p>You aren't supposed to have double stranded DNA or autoantibodies or lysosomes and you in fact, effectively don't if you aren't in some kind of pathological condition becasue the infinitesimal ammount o garbage in the blood is not biologically relevant.</p>

Actually, as I have been researching this more thoroughly i am more and more convinced that any issue seen related to the RAS system relevant to covid19 will also be relevant to the vaccine. Time will tell, and I am obviously not jumping to conclusion, but being dismissive around confirmation bias is essentially going for an ad hominem attack rather than discussing the actual relevancy - University of Illinois is certainly researching this right now - so the data will come out eventually - but menstrual disruption is certainly plausible based on female reproductive hormone association related to the RAS pathway.</p>

<p>3 years ago , I got my period unexpectedly , weeks before it was due also.  2 years ago, after I had no more LH surge and was certified as menopausal, I also got my period again , out of nowhere.  At other points, I also had exceedingly long interminable periods.  If you do menstural cycle research, like I did for PMS studies, where you have to really accurately record who is where in their cycle with blood tests and what they self report you learn 3 very important things.</p>
<p>Menstrual cycles are actually pretty irregular and variable.</p>
<p>Self report is really unreliable (that is a thing that has been documented often and well)</p>
<p>When people miss a period they attributed readily to something, even if they actually cant becasue the data they recorded for the last year says that this same thing happened in eventfully many times before and they forgot</p>

        <p>&rt;You are conflating the problems that occur during viral infections with those that happen after a vaccine.</p>
<p>I don't think that this is a problem - yes I am conflating it because both the spike protein and the covid infection compete for the ace2 receptor - if the spike protein from the mRNA is active and is migrating through the body beyond just the lymphatic drainage mechanism to the local lymph node then there is good reason to investigate. </p>
<p>&rt;If you have a background in research and are aware that anecdotes arent data then don’t use them as such -wherever the anecdotes come from.</p>
<p>I'm not in a research environment so I do feel like its okay to discuss what I am seeing anecdotally - I am not using the observations as data, just as a start point for inquiry - which, I think doesn't need to be forbidden, especially in this sub - damn, so many lines of scientific inquiry start there - sometimes the results are surprising </p>
<p>&rt;If you do menstural cycle research, like I did for PMS studies, where you have to really accurately record who is where in their cycle with blood tests and what they self report you learn 3 very important things.</p>
<p>This is a fair point, and I acknowledge this - but - my refined argument (which is admittedly evolving as I research further) is basically this: </p>
<ul>
<li>ace2 portion of the RAS system affects hormone levels in the human reproductive systems. </li>
<li>ace2 is competed by both covid19 and mRNA vaccines causing imbalances and over saturation of AngII (and likely under production of downstream system effects like Ang(1-7)</li>
</ul>
<p>Covid most certainly has an effect, mRNA vaccine appears to be having an effect based not just on menstrual irregularities, but in many of the other side effects being observed even in the data - time will certainly tell and more research is necessary but I don't believe in any way my theory here has suddenly become implausible because I used local observation to start a scientific inquiry - to be honest until I started reading I didn't know the RAS pathways played such an important part in human reproduction, I only knew the system in reference to the vascular system - and I think that's okay - I'm willing to adjust my stance as data becomes available but also feel like it is okay to discuss world observations - again we are in reddit on a sub that is flooded with memes constantly - we aren't exactly in the most elevated part of this site - I'm not at work - I'm allowed to have an opinion that isn't solely focused on data, and that doesn't suddenly invalidate it, though the last quoted statement and their associated facts has merit that I will keep in mind IRL</p>

        <p>If the spike protein was systemic and not membrane bound and present in biologically active levels in the blood and getting to ovarian tissue (none of that is happening, but lets say for the sake of argument it is), then you should have clear effects on all other organs and systems where ACE2 receptors are.</p>
<p>Which is a big no.</p>
<p>And now you have made more of a mess because in tissues where ACE2 is much more highly expressed and which yield non-cyclic ad fairly immediate effects (pretty much everything else - while the OVRAS system is important ACE2 is is fairly low levels there) you dont have issues but somehow it spares all that an yet it is mess up up the ovaries?  That is some real mental gymnastics to explain something that isnt even happening</p>
<p>And you neglect the very , very important and really dangerous hippo  in the room (becasue elephants are chill and hippos are nutcases).  The very predictable possibility that any of this could happen from either symptomatic or  asymptomatic VIRAL infection is much more viable problem and possibility than it happening from the vaccine</p>
<p>So freaking out about the non thing in an illogical and non scientific way is blinding you to the much bigger , more plausible danger.</p>

        <p>An opinion on matters of taste - knock yourself out.  You can like or not like whatever you like or dont’ like.</p>
<p>If you want to say, I am unreasonably scared of this, also knock yourself out, I have an irrational fear of scorpions.</p>
<p>But that is not what you are doing.</p>
<p>You are accusing a medical system of invalidating real concerns becasue they are women saying them. This is dangerous and intolerable becasue it does happen, and every time you play the gender disparity card when you really are being illogical and hysterical and , in fact , irrepsonsible, you make it harder for someone else to be taken seriously and for that problem to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>You are proposing mechanisms and factoids that are incorrect and are not matters of opinion but mattters of record.  And you are doing so in a way that is even more dangerous and irresponsible becasue when you say it with science-y sounding words and as if you did know what you were talking about, you are going to convince people who also don’t know what they are talking about that the vaccine is worse that the virus. In the whole history of science that has never been true and it is not true now.</p>
<p>So be clear about what an opinion is the difference between that and treacherous misinformation.</p>

        <p>No, there isn’t.</p>
<p>You cant explain mechanisms of phenomenon that doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>The RAAS system in the ovary or the OVRAS, when dysfunctioning, results in problems in the markers of ovarian health and function already measured, in fact in the 2 papers in this thread, which are fine.</p>
<p>So if that system were disrupted, then some or all of those things (hormone levels, follicular steroids genesis, oocyte maturation etc).  And in those studies ad in fertility clinics around the universe after millions of vaccinations, there is no evidence of that.</p>
<p>And you are again conflating the effects of a viral infection (the viruses are mobile and their spike proteins certain do move around and attach to ACE receptors on cells, and cells outside the respiratory system also) with the effects of the mRNA vaccine.</p>
<p>Which causes expression of spike proteins fairly locally near the site of the IM injection and the spike protein is membrane bound, is not designed to be secreted,  and even if it were , muscles cells are not secretory cells and dont have the machinery to do this anyway.</p>
<p>And if I use SUPER sensitive methods , like tagging the lipid nanoparticles with radioactive markers, I can see some radioactivity in other places, but there is little evidence that that stuff is now still active - so the minute amounts showing up distal to the injection site are not also incorporating in to cells.</p>
<p>Similar technology to this is used in labs to get mouse brains to express stuff not express stuff and the range at which they are functional from the site if injection is tiny.  The range at which I can pick up a marker (like a fluorescent tag) is farther but no stuff gets expressed there.</p>
<p>So, there is no evidence other than anecdotal furor over the anxiogenic and controversial thing.</p>
<p>The evidence that does exist actually says the opposite.</p>
<p>For a the phenomenon to exist (for the vaccine and not the virus) you have to rewrite a lot of basic cell bio.</p>
<p>negating and dismissing women’s legitimate medical issues is a huge problem, there is no denying that but it is also possible for humans to be hysterical and emotional about things that make them scared in an irrational way.  Women included.</p>

        <p>It’s easier to do science when there are less variables in the math involved.  Women’s body constant undergo changes throughout about a month span.  I support the idea of more studies on women’s body to understand how the medical field can improve but nothing will remove the fact that math is easier with less variables and biology screwed women on that front so it will always take more time and effort to come to conclusions when it comes to women’s body and new medicines when compared to men.</p>

        <p>Of course, science definitely needs to do some catching up in that regard. Women have far more delicate reproductive/endocrine systems than men do. That sucks, but that's nature, and it's what we have to work with.</p>
<p>However, that doesn't take away from the fact that women are still people, and deserve to know the consequences of putting something into their bodies. </p>
<p>They can't give informed consent until the effects of the vaccine have been tested to the same extent in their bodies as in a male body. </p>
<p>If we know how something affects male reproductive/endocrine systems, we must figure out how it affects the corresponding female systems as well before making it available to the general public.</p>
<p>In terms of the COVID vaccines, we don't have a clue as to what they do to either male or female bodies, and they should not have been released yet. The number of reports from women indicating menstrual irregularities is startling. Something seems to be off.</p>
<p>Someone dropped a couple sources in another comment on here that detail a potential method that the vaccines might harm male reproductive/endocrine function. </p>
<p>If it has the potential to harm those systems in males, it is highly likely that it could do so in females as well, and probably to a greater degree. </p>
<p>There simply has to be more research conducted and less dismissal of concern regarding these issues. At this point, a substantial portion of the population is being failed.</p>

        <p>I think you missed what I was saying. Science will never “catch up” to this inequity.  Best case we can reduce the time to release comprehensive studies of (insert medicine here) on women a year or hopefully less than 10 months after general studies on male bodies.  There are simply to many variables to ensure they come out at the same time.</p>

        <p>Good points. Wish you could get the people you're talking about to hear this, but they'd only call you names and prove your point.</p>

        <p>Thank you. </p>
<p>Those people are cultists. Every one of them has either an extreme victim or savior complex. They cannot be reasoned with. </p>
<p>In either situation, despite never believing in objective morality, they always feel that they are 100% morally correct on every last position they hold. You literally cannot debate them or question their beliefs, as they feel that they could never be wrong.</p>
<p>Where do they derive their morality from, though? If it is all subjective as many of them claim, then someone else's beliefs are no less valid than theirs, and they can never truly have the moral high ground (or even be sure that they are correct in their beliefs.)</p>
<p>No matter how righteous they believe themselves to be, if morality is subjective, their views on morality are just rationalization for why they behave the way they do.</p>
<p>They get close to the truth, but then have to deny it because it would indicate that there is a God and objective morality (that they are not adhering to.)</p>
<p>It is best to just ignore them and let them live with the consequences of their actions. They will reap what they sow. </p>
<p>We must instead look out for those of us who don't buy into this crap, and wish to retain our autonomy and natural rights.</p>
