        <p>I think that folks like you don't understand that it takes time to change a society to communism. Real freedom lovers can smell it coming from a mile away. Today it's masks, social distancing, vaccine passports, and temperature checks to interact in public. In the future, it'll be things like a social credit system, where your rations for water, food, and power depend on your allegiance to the almighty state. Anyone with a lick of common sense understands that bigger government means less individual power. I don't know about you, but I prefer to make choices for myself, without the government telling me what I can and cannot do. This is the basic principle of personal responsibility.</p>
<p>The state's response to Coronavirus was never about protecting its people. It was a blatant power grab that is quite literally laying the foundation for communism. Anyone who knows history understands that governments don't give up power so easily, if ever. "There is nothing so permanent as a temporary government program."</p>

        <p>Yes you’re right everyone is going to be communism first Hong Kong getting taken over by china now it’s the United States of America going to communism i really do belive America is converting to communism because we had to stay inside and wear masks and stay away from eachother even tho states are starting to open back up and get rid of all those rules yeah I think people like you are to focused on wanting to be somthing by making a difference instead of letting things go and seeing that it’s gonna be fine</p>

        <p>You whole communication style is terrible. If you want people to understand your message you should stop being passive aggressive and using run on sentences. The good news is, even if you had perfect grammar your message is still 70 IQ gibberish. For you to work on your grammar would be like someone polishing a turd.</p>
