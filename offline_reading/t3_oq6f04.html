    <strong>If people actually knew about their bodies natural process covidvaccinated sub wouldnt exist.</strong>
    <p><p>The side effects.</p>
<p>the poisoning.</p>
<p>the concept of the  MRNA vaccine.</p>
<p>People go running their. headaches.migraines.loss of smell and taste, vomiting, neurological conditions. etc.</p>
<p>MRNA vaccine is basically telling your body. your ancestors that developed your body. the planet the perfectly crafted you to go to hell.</p>
<p>People panic when they lose their sense of taste and smell when they get covid. But They don't realize. your body takes it away to get you to stop pursuing food. At the very least food that it knows is harmful for you. </p>
<p>How many people that died from covid really died from covid ? </p>
<p>Now take that number and think. How many of those people disrespected their bodies even when they are sick. You are not supposed to eat when you are sick. No animal does. Every animal Fast when they are sick. This puts your body in a state where it hunts down the weak and sick cells. Now combine that with the fact they people most likely still ate JUNK even when they were sick and symptoms got progressively worse.   Chugging down that ACID FORMING food( which causes mucus) which ofcourse they die from the last stage of that mucus ( clogging up the longs). </p>
<p>In order for the new normal to be complete. The elites are attempting to get people to disreguard the very existence of their own bodies.</p>
<p>A new normal body. One that owes the system that mutated it to that point everything.</p></p>
