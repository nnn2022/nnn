<p>OK, let me explain this simply:</p>
<p>There's a lab leak-vs-natural evolution narrative that is being fed to the world. The truth is that NEITHER is correct. This a distraction from the truth: there is no progenitor virus sequence because the progenitor virus never existed! If it were in existence, China - and the rest of the pre-lockdown world - would have suffered an outbreak much earlier than the time alleged by the Wet Market/Lab Leak hypothesis.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;In order to determine exactly how and where the virus originated, scientists need to find the so-called progenitor virus, the one from which all other strains descended. Until now, the earliest sequences are primarily those sampled from cases at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, which was initially thought to be where the novel coronavirus first emerged at the end of December 2019. However, cases from early December and as far back as November 2019 had no ties to the market, indicating pretty early in the pandemic that the virus emerged from another spot.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;There was one nagging issue with those first genetic sequences. Those from cases found at the market include three mutations that are missing in virus samples from cases that popped up weeks later outside of the market. The viruses missing those three mutations matched more closely with the coronaviruses found in horseshoe bats. Scientists are relatively certain that the novel coronavirus somehow emerged from bats, so it's logical to assume the progenitor would also be missing those mutations.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;And now, Jesse Bloom of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Seattle has found the deleted sequences — likely some of the earliest samples — also were devoid of those mutations.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;"They're three steps more similar to the bat coronaviruses than the viruses from the Huanan fish market," Bloom told The New York Times. This new data hints that the virus was circulating in Wuhan well before it showed up at the seafood market, Bloom said.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;"This fact suggests that the market sequences, which are the primary focus of the genomic epidemiology in the joint WHO-China report ... are not representative of the viruses that were circulating in Wuhan in late December of 2019 and early January of 2020," Bloom wrote in his paper uploaded June 22 to the preprint database bioRxiv.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;According to Zimmer, about a year ago 241 genetic sequences from coronavirus patients had gone missing from an online database called Sequence Read Archive that's maintained by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;...<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Bloom couldn't find any explanation for why the sequences had been deleted, and his emails to both corresponding authors to inquire received no response.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;"There is no plausible scientific reason for the deletion: the sequences are perfectly concordant with the samples described in Wang et al. (2020a,b)," Bloom wrote in bioRxiv. "There are no corrections to the paper, the paper states human subjects approval was obtained, and the sequencing shows no evidence of plasmid or sample-to-sample contamination. It therefore seems likely the sequences were deleted to obscure their existence."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I know that people on this sub keep saying, "Well, if push comes to shove, I'll get an inactivated whole virus C19 vaxx" but the truth is that there's no evidence of the virus actually existing because evolutionary account of the virus given by the GISAID/EMBL/GenBank/etc sequence databases is impossible.</p>
<p>For those interested in reading Dr. Bloom's method, he's written an interesting paper that made for an excellent afternoon read: <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.18.449051v1.full.pdf">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.18.449051v1.full.pdf</a></p>

        <p>I don't harp about C19 and SC2 being fabrications of the TV and internet anymore because the vaxxes are the biggest threat...but when someone else makes the connection and ends up in Nature, it means that people are starting to really see the depths of this conspiracy.</p>

        <p>Is it really possible that ... the WHO guidance from the very beginning of not treating people for their Covid symptoms aka influenza...waiting for people to be intubated... gave rise to the high death toll?</p>
<p>So an entire medical community was just derelict in their duties to treat the flu?</p>
<p>I’m a regular contributor here, so my inquiries are sincere not attacking the premise.  </p>
<p>I just don’t know how that explains the loss of taste:smell of this particular virus, making it unique.</p>
<p>I’ve watched all of David Martin’s videos and believe he had a similar premise.</p>

        <p>Yeah, the WHO knew exactly what it was doing!</p>
<p>"Stay home until your lips turn blue, then we'll ram tubes down your throat so that we damage your lungs and cause opportunistic  bacterial infections."</p>
<p>Influenza, RSV and the common cold can take out your sense of taste/smell for a very long time too. Nothing special here. I also say that 99.99% of "long COVID" symptoms are entirely psychogenic.</p>
