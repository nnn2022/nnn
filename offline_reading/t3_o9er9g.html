        <p>I can’t help feeling aggrieved that we’re making plans for thousands of fans and football fat cats travelling for the Euro finals when I can’t go to the grocery store.</p>
<p>So many rights that our democratic Britain has for centuries upheld — free movement, privacy, a life free from fear and persecution — have been eroded by this pandemic. So be it: in a crisis you expect certain sacrifices.</p>
<p>But there comes a time when the tide turns. Pandemics come and go, viruses burn out or mutate until they’re harmless, but democratic rights, for which people have fought hard for centuries, were given over in a nanosecond of fear and panic.</p>
<p>Now that more than 80 per cent of adults in the UK have coronavirus antibodies, why must we declare if our travel is ‘essential’?</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said last year the vaccination programme was the ‘cavalry’ coming to our rescue, yet now he only ‘thinks’ a double jab will open the door to foreign holidays without quarantine.</p>
<p>He gives hints and qualified promises that have been followed by so many broken promises that we cannot believe him any more.</p>
<p>And horrid Angela Merkel doesn’t seem to want freedom. Not a month ago I was supposed to appear on a German TV show when the borders were shut with a day’s notice.</p>
<p>No consideration was given to the fact that I was fully vaccinated, tested negative the day before and only going for 24 hours. Now she is trying to rally the rest of the 27 member states to impose restrictions on the UK.</p>
<p>Most people on our fair isle have been as compliant as a six-year-old, with their tongues hanging out expectantly for a treat only to have it taken away by a wicked uncle.</p>
<p>I was extremely upset just before Christmas. My daughter Tara and I had been in talks to have a three-day celebration at her house in the country.</p>
<p>We had all overdone it in the gift department and were so excited to see each other after five months.</p>
<p>Boris had promised we could have a ‘merry little Christmas’ if we kept our gatherings small.</p>
<p>So, what did he do, once again? Break that sacred promise and make everyone stay at home, family-less, over Christmas. I was gutted.</p>
<p>Similarly, June 21, ‘Freedom Day’, came and went with another presentation of flowcharts and the usual soundbites: ‘Led by the science’; ‘data’; blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>The carrot of a July 19 opening was promised, but now it’s uncertain, so no one can make plans to go abroad. And forget about the incorrectly termed staycations.</p>
<p>Several friends have told me it’s practically impossible to find a good hotel in any British seaside resort now.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in France and Spain, tourist spots are begging for visitors after months of low attendance and haemorrhaging money.</p>
<p>But America stayed open, at least partially so. Florida even managed to have the fewest restrictions and the most success during the darkest days of the pandemic.</p>
<p>As of June 15, practically all rules have been lifted. Clubs, pubs, theatres, restaurants are all business as usual.</p>
<p>Yet in the UK, where we have a much better vaccine record, we remain constrained. My American friends are amazed we are still obeying such tough restrictions.</p>
<p>Ditto France, where antibody prevalence is nowhere close to ours and the sunny beaches of the Riviera are thronging with (mostly German and Belgian) tourists and everything looks normal.</p>
<p>No multiple-metre rule, no mask wearing outdoors and Gallic hugs and kisses abounding.</p>
<p>What family of four can plan a summer holiday when they won’t know if they can go until summer is almost over? And how can they afford the astronomical fees of all the tests needed?</p>
<p>In France, where only a lateral flow test is required, testing kits are available at pharmacies. It’s 15 minutes of suspense, as opposed to 24 to 48 hours until the results come back from a PCR.</p>
<p>In this, my fifth quarantine, I feel trapped, as if in prison for a crime I didn’t commit, with the Covid warden threatening to call or visit at all hours. On top of which our building is covered in workmen and scaffolding, so there is hardly any light or privacy.</p>
<p>It’s all a joke. The amount of money this Government has wasted checking that doubly vaccinated people are staying in their homes is obscene.</p>
<p>Stop promising rewards and then cancelling them, Boris! It’s got to stop.</p>
<p>Anyone with a brain knows Covid ain’t going to go away and that we need to live like free human beings again, and not frightened little mice. No offence intended to the rodent community.</p>

        <p>Wasn’t Joan Collins the one who months ago lambasted people for not getting the jab and now she’s got both jabs she still can’t have her freedom? Pity she learned the hard way</p>

        <p>Vacations and private autos are for the prison staff. It's cute when people think this is about a virus and not about turning the world into an open air prison. You'll be delivered food and allowed 1hr in the yard for exercise.</p>
