        <p>Get ready for the collapse folks. We are about to become The United States Of Venezuela.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;A third of the city’s 230,000 <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/category/small-business">small business</a> may never reopen, according to a grim new report by a leading industry group.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The Partnership for New York City released the <a href="https://pfnyc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/actionandcollaboration.pdf">post-pandemic response plan</a> Monday with the help of 12 global consulting firms.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Accommodation, food service and retail jobs are particularly vulnerable, the 67-page study found.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Most small businesses have less than three months worth of cash reserves — a period equal to the length of the state’s COVID-19 shutdown.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“That means that funds to restart, pay back rent and buy inventory are exhausted, leaving <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/05/21/councilman-calls-on-nyc-to-reopen-struggling-small-businesses/">tens of thousands of entrepreneurs</a> at risk, particularly business owners of color,” authors Kathryn Wylde and Natasha Avanessians wrote.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;They say <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/25/vacant-retail-space-has-doubled-in-nyc-over-ten-years/">business owners face</a> high rents, regulatory burdens and taxes.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“COVID-19 has changed the value proposition, since previous advantages such as foot traffic and easy access to the offices of clients and potential customers have diminished.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“On the contrary, over the past decade, political forces have created a much more expensive and litigious environment for business that is no longer sustainable for those whose margins were narrow before the pandemic,” the authors said.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Only people in tech will be able to eat!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>The city’s tech sector survived the pandemic “relatively unscathed” and local startup companies like Clear that invented a health pass to verify a person’s COVID-19 status are poised to profit from the recovery.</strong></p>

        <p>If this is so, then this is going to end up fucking up all of the country eventually. And probably trickle into other parts of the world as well, since many places are dependant on our economy as well. What a disaster.</p>

        <p>Oh absolutely. Just to add onto your comment. The airline industry is literally days away from collapse. American says they are about to lay off 20K workers. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-20/u-s-airlines-face-the-end-of-business-travel-as-they-knew-it</p>
<p>To add, hotels associated with them(which is a lot) are also going out of business. The entire chain of tourist businesses, establishments, and whatever else are going out of business or cutting 80% of their workforce.  I'll post a seperate full post about this later today.</p>

        <p>Even if this ends (likely with digital passports or whatever the fuck they've got in store for us), travel will likely become difficult or rare. There just won't be much of a tourism or travel industry left. And new companies will not replace these either. It's all going to be dismantled, and <strong>possibly</strong> taken over by the government, similar to how it's done in Cuba. Want to go to, say, Vermont? Well, got to get it approved by the government first, and they will likely "contact trace" you, and have you tell them where you're going to visit, where you will stay, etc. It will become troublesome to even travel by plane or train or bus within the country, and out. </p>
<p>This is one of the reasons I think people who say they will flee the US are...going to fail. I think immigration will also take a huge hit, and people won't be able to travel or move either. We're all stuck, and we're all fucked.</p>

        <p>I will marry a Swede, Dane, or someone from the Netherlands and escape someway. Not staying here for the next Mussolini or Medical Hitler. Even if I had to revoke my citizenship(which you can do with two passports) then they have no legal right to trace you if you aren't in their country and I won't be coming back. People escaped Nazi Germany at it's peak when they were executing 1M jews a year, don't doubt that you can get out. Especially in the onset before the laws come in.(The late 1930s was the biggest exodus period for that same reason, Germany was highly unstable but once WW2 had started it became extremely hard to leave with the Gestapo guarding the borders). Keep faith, plan, and don't give up. Also I might ask the people in the Amazon if they need somebody that can cook a mean omelet.</p>

<p>I highly doubt they will install any loopholes like that to allow immigration at this point.</p>
<p>And I wouldn't be so sure that other countries won't succumb to this. Sweden and other places abroad have evaded the "New Normal" but once their economies tank, which they already have and will continue to do so, because this is a global catastrophe, those countries will fall in line with whatever the world (UN) does next. The only countries that won't be affected by the "New Normal" will probably be shithole third world countries (...maybe, wouldn't doubt it if they worsen).</p>

        <p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>Whenever I see people in this sub boldly claim that they plan to move to Germany or Spain or wherever, I cringe. Do they really believe moving and legally immigrating to another country is that easy? <em>Especially</em> now?</p>

        <p>Fuck you. Those are people’s jobs, livelihoods and passions. There’s a special place in hell for people like you. Aviation has been a gift to the world and allowed people to experience every culture and type of person. I’m sorry your life is so sad and dull that you can’t see that and instead wish for its demise. Far more people like travel and aviation than not so in a few years, it will just come roaring back and you can stay mad.</p>
