        <p>Lots of people (like Kamala Harris) "expressed skepticism" about the vaccine at some point. Besides, who's to say if he really has covid or if he's really in the hospital. I wouldn't put anything past the media.</p>

<p>“From 1952 through 1969, the Army dropped thousands of pounds of zinc cadmium sulfide in nearly 300 secret experiments conducted in such places as Fort Wayne, Indiana (1964-66); St. Louis (1953, 1963-65); San Francisco (1964-68); Corpus Christi (1962); and Oceanside, California (1967). Remote areas were also targeted: During 1964 the Army dropped zinc cadmium sulfide on Minnesota’s Chippewa National Forest.”</p>

<p>In other words, <strong>the CDC in 2004 knew that researchers couldn’t reliably know these particles were coronavirus particles.</strong> Not a word has been heard about this since. <strong>All virologists use these pictures as proof</strong> of the existence of this virus. <strong>It is a fraud, based on junk science, like everything else connected with “Covid 19.”</strong>

<p><strong>“Virology: Two Achilles Heels</strong></p>

<a href="http://theperthgroup.com/">HIV</a></p>
<p><strong>2) Toxicology is missing.</strong> That is, the toxic effects of antibiotics used in virological studies are not discounted. The clinical diagnoses and the epidemiology <a href="http://harvoa.org/polio/overview.htm">avoid</a> environmental toxicology.”

<p><strong>Covid-19 virus fake</strong> https://harvoa-med.blogspot.com/2020/10/cvnot.html?m=1</p>
<p><strong>“Michael Laue from one of the world’s most important representatives of the COVID-19 “panicdemic,” the German Robert Koch Institute (RKI), answered that</strong> [1]:”</p>
<p><a href="https://off-guardian.org/2021/01/31/phantom-virus-in-search-of-sars-cov-2/">I am not aware of a paper which purified isolated SARS-CoV-2.”</a></p>
<p><strong>“They didn’t isolate the virus, that is the issue.”</strong></p>
<p>&rt;-<strong>Dr. Wu Zunyou</strong>, the Chief Epidemiologist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention</p>
<p><em>Quote at 1:38 in NBC video from January 2021:</em></p>
<p>“Return to Wuhan: <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YbSdG2imqEM&amp;feature=emb_title">What Life Is Like One Year Later | NBC Nightly News”</a></p>
<p>&rt;“He answered, “They didn’t isolate the virus.” He was referring to tissue samples taken from animals sold at the market.</p>
<p>&rt;That’s an interesting answer.  Why have researchers and scientists claimed SARS-CoV-2 crossed species from animals to humans at that market, when no one ever isolated the virus from samples taken at the market?</p>
<p>&rt;The next, and <strong>far bigger question, is: When Dr. Zunyou says, “They didn’t isolate the virus,” is he ONLY referring to tissue samples taken from animals at the market? Or does his answer also apply to the first 40 human cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, which were claimed to result from a newly discovered coronavirus?</strong></p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://blog.nomorefakenews.com/2021/02/16/they-didnt-isolate-the-virus/">I’ve queried Dr. Zunyou. We’ll see if he replies.”</a></p>
<p>&rt;”Yes, there have since been papers saying they’ve produced viral isolates. But there are no controls for them. The CDC produced a paper in July, I think it was, where <strong>they said: ‘Here’s the viral isolate.’ Do you know what they did? They swabbed one person.</strong> One person, who’d been to China and had cold symptoms. One person. <strong>And they assumed he had it to begin with. So it’s all full of holes, the whole thing.”</strong> ^1
&rt;-Dr. Kevin Corbett, P.h.D.</p>
<p><strong>Christian Drosten created</strong> the fraudulent “Covid” PCR test:</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”without having virus material available”</strong> ^1 ^2</p>
<p>&rt;“relying instead on the <strong>Chinese scientists’ genetic sequence</strong> published on the internet” ^2 ^1</p>
<p>There is a saying regarding politicians, that you can tell if a politician is lying if their lips are moving. With virologists you can tell when they are lying when they use the word “isolation”. ^3</p>
<p>“As of January 22, 2021 46 institutions and offices have responded to said requests. Every institution has failed to provide, or cite, even 1 record describing the actual isolation of any ‘SARS-COV-2’ from a patient sample by anyone, anywhere on the planet, ever.” ^4</p>

        <p>If an adult without significant cognitive deficits, who isn't a ward of the state, who paradoxically wants to live, runs in front of traffic everyday for no good reason, risking everyone on that road's life everyday to make some nonsensical conspiracy point, one day gets hit by a bus and no one else gets injured, I'd call that the best longterm outcome.</p>
