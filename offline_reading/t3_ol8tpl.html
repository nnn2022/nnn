    <p><p>Clothing companies would never fail because of trying on clothes.  Groceries would still be desired to be seen in person like fruits.  Stores like WalMart would survive because of being one stop shops for things things and more through essential stores where vaccination is mandatory. The general public easily gravitate towards the convenience of ordering things and doing "recreational" activities from their couch. </p>
<p>We continue to be subliminally programmed by the algorithms presented by the screens in front of us and our behaviors.  Even more accurate data is gathered by the increased screen time.</p>
<p>Get ready for the delta variant and whatever happens after that. AMC theaters will only allow vaccinated and be used by a larger corporation that'll build new stores.  GameStop will try to move online, and it's success will be determined by if becomes an gaming centered StockX/EBay.</p>
<p>Your stocks will be worth nil because of the reset that'll include a forced and tracked global currency that'll replace the highly inflated ones.</p></p>
