        <p>19th century people did. When the French demanded a constitution, Charles X offered them a charter of government instead.  He knew that a charter granted as a free gift by the sovereign to his people puts him in the driver's seat. A constitution foisted upon him by the people boxes him into a corner.</p>

        <p>Most people throughout all of humanity have been more subject than citizen.</p>
<p>The democracy and freedom of the western world was a temporary aberration for a couple centuries.  We're now seeing the return to the historical norm of submitting to authoritarianism.  The primitive hindbrain always submits to what it perceives as the strongest of the pack.</p>

        <p>This is why it's important for a governing body to defer to a higher power.  Even if you don't believe in God, it's in your best interests to concede that our rights are granted to us from something greater than ourselves.</p>
<p>Atheists, we won't agree on much, but until you can argue from morality, just trust the faithful on this one: when you let other people grant you rights, there's nothing stopping them from taking them away.</p>

        <p>The idea that governments magically grant rights is completely illogical regardless of ones thoughts on God/spirituality. </p>
<p>For another to <em>give</em> you something, they must first possess it themselves. Where does government (which is nothing more than an organization of human beings) first get them so that they can give them to you? It's an insane belief, and I cannot fathom how the idea of inherent natural rights and individual sovereignty is a fringe concept to most people. It's tragic.</p>

        <p>It's scary, really.  If rights were in fact "natural", or just inherent, then we're no different than any other animals (and if that's how some folks want to live, then fine.  I just don't think it's helpful).</p>
<p>If a squirrel robs some nuts from another squirrel, it's just survival, cold and efficient.  It's also evidence that rights and individual sovereignty aren't exactly natural.  To me, it's not so evident that natural rights - traditionally life, liberty, and property - are just a given.</p>

        <p>And there's another problem there: I like your definition of a "right", and I really think it's helpful, but it's only your definition.  Without a higher power, there's no reason why somebody else's definition is any better than yours.</p>

        <p>What good are ready rights granted by anyone other than the government?</p>
<p>If the government grants me rights, then the police or even the military will enforce them if necessary. If I'm born with them then what, will my umbilical cord show up put of thin air and strangle someone who wants to violate them? Seriously, what actual physical consequence is there to rights violations if the government isn't recognizing those rights?</p>

        <p>The hindrance of rights being inherent is, bad rights can be hard to get rid of and new rights near impossible to add.</p>
<p>You all act as if morality hasn't evolved and grown over time.  Why would we even need any form of social rights movement if inherent rights was so perfect?</p>
<p>The only reason government can take any rights away is because we let them, and the only reason things don't improve is because we stopped fighting to make things better.</p>
<p>Inherent rights aren't inherently good.  Depends on what a society considers a right or not.  Which of course means they aren't inherent.  The belief in inherent rights is the belief of lazy populace.  You have what rights you have because people fought for them tooth and nail.  That's the only way you get them, and that's the only way you keep them.</p>

        <p>If morality never changes then what/who defined it in the first place? Morality is not some fundamental law of the universe like gravity, it is an entirely human constructed. You act like the entire philosophical community is in agreement on morality. Your belief is just one of many. You have a right to that belief but attacking some else for their moral beliefs is wrong. </p>
<p>Debates about morality have literally been going on for thousands of years, do you really believe that you yourself have definitively settled thousands of years of debates? If so congrats! Children centuries from now are going to be learning about the great Philosopher ‘TupacsFather’ who wrote elegant comments on Reddit which finally determined that morality was a fundamental law of nature. They will be in awe of your reasoning and knowledge!</p>

        <p>You literally would not know it was wrong because you don’t know what right or wrong is. Right and wrong is a human construct. There are plenty of people who genuinely do not think raping someone is wrong. The only reason the rest of us believe it is wrong is because that is the general consensus we have agreed upon as a society. Psychopaths who commit rapes and murders genuinely have no remorse for their actions. They understand that society thinks what they did is wrong, but they don’t feel remorse, and would continue to commit those acts if left to their on devices.</p>

        <p>And I don't give a fuck what they would have to say. People in the past <em>believed</em> that enslaving Africans was their "God-given" right and it was considered legal and good. Now we think it's evil and it's illegal. Was it magically good back then simply because they <em>believed</em> it was? Of course not. Did it only become evil once we decided it was? Again, of course not.  It was <em>always</em> evil. <strong>Regardless of their belief.</strong> Morality does not magically change just because of your opinion of it.</p>

        <p>I have to disagree. The belief in inherent rights is the belief of an aware species. Society’s lack of a truth doesn’t make that truth less true. How many years did people think the universe revolved around the earth instead of the earth revolving around the sun? Doesn’t mean that the earth wasn’t actually still revolving around the sun during that time.</p>
<p>So I’m looking at other cultures and the past I think using context of their beliefs or perceived ignorance is key before passing any kind of judgement. But the rights we know to be inherent today weren’t any less inherent before.</p>
<p>People do and always have had the right to express themselves and believe or worship freely. </p>
<p>People do and always have had the right to prepare to defend themselves in the event of aggression from outside parties.</p>
<p>This is as true for the cavemen as it is for us now. Their awareness of it is irrelevant. </p>
<p>As far as it being lazy to believe in this kind of morality I’d argue that it’s actually much more difficult. When you’re not practicing situational ethics, you actually have to live by your scruples, even when it’s inconvenient or causes you other problems.</p>

        <p>Tell that to LGBT+ people who are illegal in 71 countries. And the African Americans who were slaves until 1865.
Asking you to wear a mask to help protect people isn’t infringing your rights. It’s to keep people safe.
I do agree with the fact that people should be given rights at birth and not have to be granted them by a government, though. People should have the rights of people.</p>

        <p>I don’t know if you realized, but 99 isn’t 100? You don’t know the circumstances of the people around you or if they might have preexisting conditions, the mask is to help them, not you. Do you really not care if you might be the cause of someone else getting sick? Or dying? I’d rather not take the risk, and it’s not that hard for me to put a piece of cloth over my face. I would rather save someone’s life than having the minute amount of freedom reduced that comes from putting on a mask.</p>

        <p>You could walk into the street and get hit by a bus and die on the spot. That's how life is and always has been. Every year millions of people die from the flu, from cancer, from tons of different diseases. How is Covid any different? People die and that is out of our control. It sucks but death is part of life. And if you want to live your life cooped up in a house watching CNN double masked go ahead but don't sacrifice others jobs, and happiness for it. And now that the high risk people are vaccinated we should be all set. My point is that shit happens. Bad things happen like car accidents, beat attacks, heart attacks, and a bunch of other things and that's the way it always has been and always will be. So why are we quarantining now?</p>

        <p>If we can save more lives by doing those things why shouldn’t we? If it’s possible to increase the chance of survival, even by a fraction, why shouldn’t we do that? We have seatbelts and airbags in cars to possibly save people who get into accidents. We have machines and medicines that at least try to help people who have heart attacks. They’re not 100 percent effective, but they’re in place to try and help people survive. COVID precautions are the same. They’re not full proof, just things to help us until we can get over this virus. And I’m not sure if you’d be saying “People always die,” when it’s someone close to you or you yourself.</p>

        <p>I could wear six masks and save grandma but she could die in a car accident on her way home. The airbags could fail, machines can fail.
Preventing death is a good thing I can see that but the lockdown  are making people commit suicide because they've gotten so depressed and lost their job. So how do we prevent death there?</p>

        <p>You’re right there’s no way to save every human. I’ve tried to commit suicide. Mental hospitals help. I already said that nothing is full proof. And we should be looking for ways to stop those problems, like people losing their jobs. I just don’t know what we can do to save the everyone. More people have died of COVID than people who have killed themselves because of it. I wish there was a way to save everyone, but saving more should take priority at the moment. That sounds inhuman, but I really wish there was a way to save everyone.</p>

        <p>You’re right, it doesn’t affect you. But are you so inhumane that you would let someone die when you could possibly save them? It doesn’t affect you, so it doesn’t matter? Not your problem? Do you realize how selfish that is? If it was you? Would you want someone who could potentially save you to do nothing because it’s not their problem? If someone could save your family member that’s dying, but doesn’t because it’s not their problem? I don’t think you’d like that very much.</p>

        <p>I hate to tell you this, but you, or I, could have given somebody the flu inadvertently at any time during our lives, and they may have died from it. We don't know. We can't know. That's simply a reality in life. It's a reality everybody accepted, and nobody acted crazy about before COVID, and the indoctrination that followed. </p>
<p>If you don't find it hard or restricting to put a piece of cloth over your face, by all means do so. It's a free country, and you should what you feel is best to protect you and others, as will I. But you, Government, and Health Departments, have no right to force that on others. Private businesses can, technically, but they should also be free from regulation and Governmental and Regulatory harassment on the matter. And they should be considerate of all their guests, and default to the least restrictive policies they can reasonably. Because the reality, is that what we're dealing with now, has literally always been our reality. You're just being told to be afraid of it now, and do things like lockdown, social distance, and wear masks.</p>
<p>People died before, and you and I may have very well played a hand in that through unintentional virus transmission. That's life. Unless somebody knowingly has COVID, and then goes and coughs, sneezes, or spits on Grandma or somebody else, they DID NOT KILL THEM. Period. There is ZERO room to have this idiotic narrative about anti-maskers killing people, and it's just unintelligent to the utmost degree to espouse it.</p>

        <p>Some places require you to do something, like some schools require you to have a uniform and put it on every day for the particular purpose that other clothes might interrupt with learning. Making you do something is like forcing you to do that particular thing. Mask mandates don’t force you to put on a mask, but they require them if you want to go in most public places. Therefore, if you don’t want to put on a mask, then don’t go in those places because they do require them. No one’s making you do anything.</p>

        <p>That’s true, and I don’t think it would be a good idea to force everyone to get a vaccine. There have always been people against them, but when COVID is still an issue right now, people should have the right to refuse the people that haven’t had vaccines. You shouldn’t have to get a vaccine, but you also shouldn’t get mad at some of the repercussions that might come from not getting one.</p>

        <p>Yeah but not getting a vaccine shouldn’t prevent someone from doing what they need to do to live. That’s the rights we are talking about here. If I have to get a vaccine to work, eat, or buy and sell, those are rights, you can’t just take that away.</p>

        <p>Yes, but once again, if you have those rights, why can’t businesses have them, within reason? If you can choose to not get a vaccine, they can also choose to not let you in because there’s a chance someone could get sick. This works both ways. And that doesn’t do anything to affect your ability to do those things, it makes it harder, but it is still possible.</p>

        <p>But I have heard the vaccine doesn’t even prevent it from spreading so why would that make a difference if someone was vaccinated or not? You seem to really defend the idea of preventing people who don’t want to take part in  an experimental vaccine from living their lives. You are also part of the problem and you are not welcome here. Go back to wherever you came from and stay there.</p>

        <p>Ok, but maybe if you educated yourself instead of listening to what others said you’d find out that the vaccine helps you from getting COVID. Which, in turn, prevents you from spreading it. If you can’t get it, you can’t spread it. And “experimental”? I’d like to see one viable source that says that. Why don’t you go educate yourself instead of believing everything you hear.</p>

        <p>Yeah ok. Why don’t you keep supporting the NWO agenda? Started off crying about black people and now you want to take our rights away if we don’t wanna take the experiential MRNA vaccine. You can fuck right off</p>
