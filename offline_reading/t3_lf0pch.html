    <strong>My grandma passed away today</strong>
    <p><p>No, not from Covid. She was 92 years old and died of natural causes. </p>
<p>The sad part is that she wasn't surround by friends and family and the last time I saw her was on December 13th (and even them because I didn't give a damn what my uncles thought about that). But mostly I respected their wishes and didn't go see her. </p>
<p>I regret that I didn't spend more time with her and that she couldn't spend more time with her great grand daughters. </p>
<p>Spend time with your elderly family,  they will pass away anyway. </p>
<p>I don't want to see her after she died. I wanted her to see me while she was alive.</p></p>

        <p>My condolences. Not being able to see your grandparents, parents, or any loved ones when they die because "you might be a danger" or "you might put yourself in danger" is just fucking cruel. People deserve to die surrounded by loved ones, in the same room, close to them, holding their hands, being able to see their faces, not having their faces hidden by those goddamn masks. I am so sorry.</p>

        <p>My condolences. It's a already a weird freaking time and grief doesn't help. rest in peace to your grandma I know how you feel. We buried my granddad today, who passed away from Asbestos-related lung cancer last week. Nothing to do with covid, though they forced him to be tested twice in his last week cause they panicked and thought he caught it cause he was coughing... like.. yah he had lung cancer, of course he's gonna cough, freaking leave him be why even bother testing him. </p>
<p>We did get to visit him a lot before he died in the hospice, though they did force us to wear masks  ( i think i wrote about that last week) but i was so irritated today. Only 40 people were allowed to come to the funeral. I'm in a choir  of around 30 people, and normally the whole choir pulls together in cases like deaths or weddings and at least 20/25 of us would be present. With the restrictions i could only invite 7 choir members. And loads of other people, family, friends, loved ones, couldn't be invited either. </p>
<p>Then we had to wear masks while walking in the funeral home. And while we were allowed to have a cup of coffee afterwards (which wasnt allowed back in may when my grandma died). But we werent even allowed to hug our friends and loved one and mourn together. My other grandparents from my dads side were there and the two granddads always got along great in life so my other granddad was very sad and crying, and i couldnt go over and comfort him cause the damn funeral supervisors were watching us like a hawk.  We ended up getting way with a couple of comforting handshakes and shoulder  touches here and there, but it was so stupid to not get to hug eachother.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's a freaking awful thing to happen during this shit time. I hope things are less idiotically strict where you are and you get to say goodbye in a semi-normal manner.</p>
<p>Cause damn these stupid regulations make grief twice as bad as it would normally be. and it just pisses me off</p>

        <p>Sad thing is that I had the mildest threaten scratch and running nose Friday and saturday. I did take a test but the results came after the burial. So I was wearing a mask and did not hug my mom. </p>
<p>The test came back negative so I will probably go visit her tonight and give her a huge hug. Buy I wanted to do it there. </p>
<p>There are restrictions in place, but in Brazil things like this don't "stick", people will simply not do it, so you will see a lot of people not wearing masks and even small business not caring less. But I didn't want to put my mother at risk, she is 65 and has high blood pressure, so I'm not risking her luck. </p>
<p>I'm the guy take went to a close friends party and no one cared about masks. Usually we only do it if there are expectations of forcing us, like in a big business that is going to be policed or around police.</p>

        <p>Damn that sucks. Everyone today was already sniffling  not from sadness or crying but because it's -5 degrees celcius in the netherlands and due to become -15 i heard in the coming days. So it's cold as heck. If everyone with a runny nose had stayed home we would have had an empty auditorium. </p>
<p>Not everyone here follows the rules either. But I feel like the Netherlands is becoming more and more sheep-like obedient now as time goes on. In June etc we were still pretty rebellious here with little in the way of rules or regulations, but as time went by and the national elections get ever closer the government is putting the boot on our necks more and more and sadly people just take it lying down.</p>
