        <p>Right away, you need to ask a few questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why are they using a progressive scale rather than a periodic one?</li>
<li>Why do they truncate the Y-axis by ignoring non-covid deaths?</li>
<li>What are the estimates based on? Where are they conjuring up bodies? My wife would probably happily off me, but she can't find a convenient spot to offload my corpse, where are these mysterious hiding spots folks have?</li>

        <p>So basically, the deaths relating to non pandemic circumstances vastly outweighed the amount of deaths caused by the virus causing the pandemic. Of course.</p>

&rt;
&rt;The suicide rate is up in the US, Canada, and the EU.
&rt; </p>
<p>This is indisputably true. That said - the total homicide mortality for the US is going to be somewhere in the realm of ~19,000. If we allow that's a 30% excess or so over the norm, that accounts for something like 5,700 excess deaths. The total estimate of excess deaths in the year of 2020
 in somewhere in the general order of 500,000 deaths. </p>

I will grant that these 5 liberal Governor's (NY, NJ, Pennsylvania, California, and Michigan) helped pad the excess deaths numbers.</p>
<p>I'm not sure this holds. <a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20210403/50-state-analysis-finds-excess-deaths-from-COVID-19-and-other-causes-in-the-US.aspx">Here a study shows that the states with the highest excess death percentages are a quite varied group</a>:</p>
<p>&rt;According to the study's data, the 10 states with the highest per capita rate of excess deaths were Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, Arizona, Alabama, Louisiana, South Dakota, New Mexico, North Dakota and Ohio.</p>
<p>I wouldn't call MS, AL the Dakotas or Ohio particularly left leaning states, and leadership in the Dakotas in particular was especially resistant toward public intervention. That said, New Jersey <em>did</em> have public interventions early and throughout the pandemic, so it should be asked whether their efforts were particularly ineffective, unique outliers, or whether there are other external considerations. And the fact that excess death numbers are <em>generally</em> comparable across US states lines suggests this isn't easily explained by single state padding or over reporting.</p>

        <p>I see.</p>
<p>I prefer the one I supplied as it's global and proves that the reaction to COVID was an overreaching, inept, panicked response for basically nothing. I wouldn't say nothing, their policies caused more harm that good </p>
<p>There are no excess deaths from a global perspective between 2019 and 2020. Obviously we don't have the numbers for 2021 yet. </p>
<p>Why would there be for a virus that overwhelming kills those at or beyond their life expectancy?</p>

        <p>Look where the excess deaths are... Asia?</p>
<p>China hasn't reported anything honestly since approximately forever, but we can still be pretty sure they didn't actually have a ton of excess deaths. Even if they <em>did</em> they would never let anyone know about it.</p>
<p>Places like the Philippines have locked down pretty hard. This directly impacts the poorest in society. The nameless, the homeless, the jobless. Here in the US there's unemployment money and stimulus money --- in places like that, there's only the kindness of other people. Maybe you'll get some rice and a can of sardines to feed your family.</p>
<p>And that's only one country that I know of. What about the desperately poor of Mumbai or Dhaka? I imagine it's worse.</p>
<p>It'd be really hard to hide a big outbreak among the poor. People would be dying, and governments would be incentivized to quarantine to curb the rampant spread due to unsanitary conditions.</p>
<p>More likely those excess deaths are victims of a strangled economy. Manufacturing jobs lost due to western world shutdowns. Day laborers with no where to work because of shutdowns. The desperately poor of the world are always teetering on the brink, and it doesn't stretch the imagination to think it was starvation, not illness, that created a significant portion of excess deaths.</p>

        <p>Exactly.  If I was a poor person in some slum in the Philippines, you can bet the biggest risk I'd be facing health-wise would be being blocked from participating in the economy.  </p>
<p>Poor people in developing countries are very resourceful, but they really do depend an awful lot on those paychecks coming in.</p>

        <p>This is another excellent point that I let go in my original reply:</p>
<p>They're looking at "observed excess deaths" in the gray and "estimated excess deaths" in the red. (IMO presenting data this way is unethical, but I don't think it actually crosses any established ethical lines)</p>
<p>There were a few excess deaths in the West, which are easily explained by lockdowns and unemployment and depression/suicide.</p>
<p>In Asia? They're just 100% guessing.</p>
<p>Those models are about as reliable as the models that said Miami would be underwater by now.</p>

        <p>No. This is excess deaths.  This means people who were alive, died.  Something is killing them.  It's not COVID obviously.  So is there another airborne virus that's killing people are we're just calling it COVID?  Follow the money.</p>
