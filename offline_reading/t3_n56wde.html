    <strong>What this bullshit has revealed about people i use to look up to</strong>
    <p><p>from the time of last summer when we figured out what covid was like in terms of behavior, things were much different. We can all agree that in march of 2020, covid being new was fair to be fearful of because it would something different. But its been 15 months since then and the 10% deathrate that was projected was clearly wrong. </p>

<p>Before Covid i was pretty big into progressive politics, i basically supported Bernie. Now im sure most people in this sub-reddit are gonna tease me for my points of view, but ive actually come around to seeing that alot of people that were in the progressive part of the democratic party are just nothing but fearmongering Doomers. watching the The young turks basically makes my head hurt because they are pushing the Vaccine really hard. In fact, they basically came out and said they would be okay with Vaccine Passports to go into sporting events and bars. Made me realize a political show thats based in LA, you have to be pretty rich; and considering Cenk and ana (the Hosts) both make 6 figure incomes, ive realized their point of view are pretty on par with LA politics considering how California has been the hardest in terms of lockdowns. Another person i loved watch was Secular talk. Realizing  Kyle Kulinski  also makes a 6 figure income as well, considering hes based in NY and he does a podcast with Krystal Ball ( also a millionaire). </p>

<p>Covid really showed how pro-lockdown these people i mentioned are. they also are basically pro-mask and they say Fauci isnt full of shit.</p></p>
