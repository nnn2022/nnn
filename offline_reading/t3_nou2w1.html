    <strong>Fighting the New Normal is Now a Mainstream Political View in the USA! There is a robust anti-lockdown consensus on almost the entire right-wing side of the nation’s politics!</strong>
    <p><p>Every major candidate in my state’s Republican primary election for Governor is equally strongly opposed to lockdowns, vaccine passports, and continued mask mandates. After the spectacular work of Ron DeSantis in Florida, the movement against the New Normal is not just mainstreamed but now also a major policy point of the whole opposition Republican Party in the USA! Simply identifying as Republican or sympathetic to conservatism in any way already signals one’s likely opposition to the New Normal!</p>
<p>Even though a desire for continued COVID tyranny continues on in certain corners of the Democrat party, the New Normal policies now have very strong opposition by powerful political forces that people can fight alongside without having to go completely anti-establishment! Instead of taking to the streets in desperate protests, American activists against the New Normal can count on ample support among major political candidates and party structures to fight for freedom!</p>
<p>The situation in the USA seems much more optimistic than in nations that seem to have much less political diversity on the COVID question even among opposing parties.</p></p>

        <p>I love that for us, truly. Seems like not even 6 months ago, European, Canadian and Australian redditors were laughing at the US response to covid.  I guess socialized medicine is a double-edged sword.  Sure, you pay less (out of pocket) but we aren't at the mercy of an inefficient, nationalized medical bureaucracy who will tell us when we can reopen movie theaters and restaurants lest their precious tiny capacity ends up overwhelmed by 12 whole cases of covid.</p>

        <p>Yes, privatized medicine and our state-level decentralization were super vital in allowing us to escape from this nightmare seemingly okay... or at least with strong political hope.</p>

        <p>Now, if we could just get Republicans to stop acting like Democrats on a bunch of other issues, we might make some progress.</p>
<p>The Democrats are done in America I believe, regardless if Republicans have the political will to finish them off as a viable party. Many Democrats have FINALLY figured out that they are part of Communism Lite and have left for good.</p>
<p>I simply can't wait for the next election cycle. It's going to be a circus of monumental proportions. And election fraud will be MUCH more difficult for the Communists this time since they let that cat out of the bag last election. The elites know they need to kill us all before then because if we actually have fair and honest elections in 2022, Democrats (Communists) will be toast except for the bluest of the blue.</p>

        <p>I agree. A lot of a purple states will turn solidly Red, and a few big Blue states may turn purple.</p>

        <p>It’s true, but it’s their job to win votes. That they believe this kind of policy will do so represents a huge sea-change and it will be important in securing a historical legacy for opposition to lockdowns if they do well in the midterms on this basis. </p>
<p>Compare that with the UK where our main opposition party’s ideas range from lock down sooner, lock down harder and lock down for longer and you might see why this is better than nothing. </p>
<p>Of course this is a transparent attempt to pander to a certain demographic and win votes, but I for one am a single-issue voter at this point and I imagine many others feel the same way.</p>

        <p>still a few RINOs here and there, but it's way better than other countries where you only have RINOs and Commies.</p>
