<title>Further evidence of the increase in youth depression, mental illness and suicide due to lockdowns. So the least affected by the disease are the most affected by the cure? Don’t you dare blame this sharp rise on anything else! (Thanks to The Last American Vagabond for the sterling research)</title>

    <p><p>While the global rates of youth depression and suicidal ideation have of course tragically been on the increase for decades, it is hard not to see the acceleration of this trend in the last twelve months. It is entirely intuitive and predictable, and indeed was predicted (by entities like the U.K. think tank SAGE, committee reports from February 2020 delineated) but was clearly considered acceptable collateral damage in the war against COVID.</p>
<p>At my school one healthy, previously happy student 12 year old hanged herself in July, though I believe this was called accidental death on her death certificate, so again will not show up in the official statistics, whenever UK’s PHE decides to release them. Official suicide data for 2020-21 is being obfuscated globally right now.</p>
<p>Try negotiating these official U.K. government labyrinths:</p>

<p>But just what are they trying to hide? This US study maybe?</p>
<p><strong>Highlights/ lowlights include:</strong></p>
<p><strong>“In March and April 2020, mental health claim lines for individuals aged 13-18, as a percentage of all medical claim lines, approximately doubled over the same months in the previous year</strong>. All medical claim lines (including mental health claim lines), however, decreased by approximately half. That pattern of increased mental health claim lines and decreased medical claim lines continued through November 2020, though to a lesser extent....”</p>
<p>“Comparing August 2019 to August 2020 in the Northeast, <strong>for the age group 13-18, there was a 333.93 percent increase in intentional self-harm</strong> claim lines as a percentage of all medical claim lines, a rate higher than that in any other region in any month studied for that age group.“</p>
<p><strong>”For the age group 13-18, claim lines for overdoses increased 94.91 percent as a percentage of all medical claim lines in March 2020 and 119.31 percent in April 2020 over the same months the year before.”</strong></p>
<p>“<strong>For the age group 6-12, from spring to November 2020, claim lines for obsessive-compulsive disorder and tic disorders increased as a percentage of all medical claim lines from their levels in the corresponding months of 2019.</strong>”</p>

<p>“The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released new data drawn from a survey done June 24 through 30. The data show a fourth of young adults in the U.S. said they “seriously considered suicide” in the month before they were surveyed. Close to a third of Americans reported anxiety and depression symptoms and more than one in 10 adults said they have started or increased the abuse of drugs/alcohol during the pandemic.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>10.7% of respondents overall reported having seriously considered suicide in the 30 days before completing the survey.</strong></li>
<li><strong>25.5% of respondents aged 18-24 years seriously considered suicide in the month before the survey.</strong></li>
<li><strong>30.7% of people who are unpaid caregivers for adults said they have seriously considered suicide. Men were more likely than women to say they have recently considered seriously suicide.</strong></li>
<li><strong>21.7% of “essential workers” said they seriously considered suicide in the month before the survey.</strong></li>
<li><strong>30% reported symptoms of anxiety disorder or depressive disorder.</strong></li>
<li><strong>13% started or increased substance use to cope with stress or emotions related to COVID-19.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Overall, 40.9% of respondents reported at least one adverse mental or behavioral health condition.”</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>“Since schools shut their doors in March, an early-warning system that monitors students’ mental health episodes has sent more than 3,100 alerts to district officials, raising alarms about suicidal thoughts, possible self-harm or cries for care. By December, 18 students had taken their own lives.”</p>
