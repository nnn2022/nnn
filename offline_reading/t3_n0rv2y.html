        <p>Right buddy, the most popular president of ALL TIME joe Biden, dementia patient, known KKK associate, already been Vice President for 8 years and got precisely nothing done...</p>
<p>I mean YouTube literally got rid of their dislike button because Biden’s videos had like a 10 to 1 dislike ratio.  You don’t have to like trump, but Biden is a fucking disgrace to all of humanity and frankly, completely embarrassing.</p>

        <p>Mate I’m Canadian.  I don’t subscribe to either political party of yours, I just know insanity when I see it.  </p>
<p>For citation that Biden is the actual racist, search Biden KKK and you’ll find many pictures of him with leaders of the kkk, shaking hands, sitting with during parades.  Biden is also the person who voted in the current legislation that incarcerates vastly more black people.  You can do your own research on that </p>
<p>For proof that he’s a dementia patient....idk man....watch ANY press conference of his recently.  If you think that dude has all his marbles there then maybe you’re a dementia patient too.  </p>
<p>Obama is one of the biggest pieces of shit also, just because he’s black doesn’t mean he didn’t kill more people worldwide than ANY president before him.  In 2012 Obama passed the Smith-Mundt act which essentially got rid of media outlets needing to have even a shred of reality in their reporting.  Look it up.  Obama is a complete piece of fucking garbage, he’s just a smooth talking piece of garbage.  </p>
<p>From the outside looking in, you idiots got so taken aback by a president who spoke his mind on Twitter that you completely forgot to look at what the president ACTUALLY did.  Now you have a globalist pawn as your president.  Wake the fuck up.</p>

        <p>I'd rather have a gLoBaLiSt President than one probe to hissy fits and one that has son modicum of tact.  I may have a bit of rose tinted glasses going on.... But even <em>I</em> can see that 4 years under trump was shitty as can be, and no need for 4 more... Also, why is it that trump sat on his was and did next to nothing vaccine clinic wise... But when Biden came in, stuff finally started getting done?</p>
<p>Also... Notice how the news has gotten more substantitive once trump got out.  Its like now that the football got out, we could actually have NEWS again..</p>

        <p>Ok so you’ve come out and plainly said it.  You’d rather have a pedophile, a real racist, a dementia patient and a globalist puppet... than someone who gets into twitter fights? You need to get your priorities straight buddy, that’s fucking nuts.  </p>
<p>I’m sure youre probably oblivious to this if you actually watch the news for any sort of reliable information, As I’ve told you and you’ve conveniently ignored, since 2012 the news and media does not have to have any actual facts in the “news” they report thanks to Obama.  Doesn’t it scare you, just a little bit, that every major news outlet, every celebrity, every big company, every corporation, every sports star, China, the world economic forum, the UN, and essentially EVERYBODY was pulling for Biden to get in? Doesn’t that freak you out just a little bit? No? </p>
<p>I can tell from how you’re regurgitating mainstream media talking points that you’re about as brainwashed as they come.  I’d like for you to tell me exactly HOW 4 years under trump was “the worst ever”? Use real world examples please, Twitter tantrums don’t fucking matter.</p>

        <p>Okay.  Twitter aside, Trump in the public eye was brash, abrasive, mocking, and unable to seemingly follow prior protocol.  Heck... His presidential debates were a prime example.  Talking over and interrupting his opponent... When told the next debate would have cuttable mics so he wouldn't be able to interrupt the other person, he threw a quasi-hissyfit and refused to debate.  Also, not answering the questions.  At least when Biden would do that, he admitted he didn't know, or said he can't/won't answer said question.</p>
<p>His frivolous lawsuits too... What was it.. 60+ lawsuits and only 1 succeeded and only partly on that one, still no overturned votes?</p>
<p>I could go on, But you've already probably/have tuned me out by the word "aside"...</p>

        <p>So everything you just stated has to do with his attitude, or you not liking who he is as a person.  </p>
<p>What did he ACTUALLY DO as president that makes him the “worst president ever”? Worse than Nixon, worse than Clinton, worse than Bush, worse than Reagan, worse than Obama? It doesn’t surprise me that you don’t even actually know anything about what trump actually did in office other than what the mainstream media pushes on you which is how he acted as a PERSON.  Not what he actually did as the president.</p>

        <p>TBH, if Trump died tomorrow or didn't do anything for the rest of his days... There would still be trump talk... As in his legacy, the things he did or messed up... Etc.  But he DOES continue to spout off stupid things, baseless conspiracies, untruths, etc... So he's in a way making himself more known even after his legacy is done...</p>

        <p>“The Smith-Mundt Modernization Act (SMMA) was buried in the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act for good reason – because it repealed the 1948 Smith-Mundt Act. The Smith-Mundt Act is also known as the U.S. Information and Education Act, which authorized the State Department to engage in propagandizing foreign countries as a form of public diplomacy.</p>
<p>The SMA established that via the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), Voice of America (VOA), and Radio Free Europe (RFE), the U.S. State Department and Office of Public Affairs were authorized to disseminate propaganda to foreign publics, but were strictly prohibited from releasing that same propaganda in America for public consumption. Put simply, our government was permitted to lie to people in other countries, but not to us here at home.</p>
<p>This prohibition was lifted in 2012, when the SMMA was signed into law by President Obama, allowing the same propaganda disseminated by our government to foreign publics, to now be released in the U.S. for the very first time.</p>
<p>And yes, our government is also now allowed to create propaganda tailored specifically for U.S. public consumption, using any media as it sees fit, while remaining anonymous as the source of the material being reported.”</p>

        <p>Maybe I'm ignorant, maybe so.  But I've got more stuff on my plate that's personally-important right now than to jump down a nebulous rabbit hole without any really concrete/good proof that there IS a rabbit hole in the first place.</p>
<p>I mean... The whole back-autism thing has been debunked heavily, and that thing started because a guy lied on a scientific study...  He was found out, and I'm sure if there is medical effery then it too will get sussed out.</p>
<p>I will admit I WAS worried about the vaccines being rushed... But only politically so?  (E.g. trump would push it out too quickly without the phase 1/2 tests being done for political clout.)  But now that the Vaxx is out, I'm reasonably sure it's safe.</p>
<p>But for now I'll go with the experts on this whole thing, and keep an eye out for weirdness and problems.</p>

<p>Something to consider for everyone avoiding the vaccine</p>
<p>It is becoming increasingly apparent that the spike protein itself is toxic, not only does it have potential for prion disease, but also general neurotoxicity: </p>
<p><a href="https://carterheavyindustries.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/covid19-rna-based-vaccines-and-the-risk-of-prion-disease-1503.pdf">https://carterheavyindustries.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/covid19-rna-based-vaccines-and-the-risk-of-prion-disease-1503.pdf</a></p>

<p>If you haven't been vaccinated but spend any time around those that have, you will be exposed to high amounts of this spike protein. It is not a coincidence that many women spending time around vaccinated women are also having period issues. </p>
<p>It is also not a coincidence that many people are becoming ill and developing covid symptoms after being vaccinated because what so many fail to realize is that <strong>many of the symptoms of covid are not due to the virus in it's totality, but due to the spike protein itself. Therefore, it would follow that reprogramming all cells in the body to generate this spike protein continually would lead to higher rates of disease, not just for those vaccinated, but to those spending time around them as well.</strong> </p>
<p>I speak from personal experience, my girlfriend that I live with got her first moderna shot a few weeks ago. Despite working in retail since last september, she never got symptomatic covid until after she got her shot. She got a full body rash 7 days from the shot, and 3 days after that was "the sickest i've been in 7 years". A few days after the worst of her sickness (high fever and cough) she developed a major rash at the injection site that wasn't there previously. </p>
<p>I never get sick, never get the flu, and never have worse than a cough or sore throat. But since she got vaccinated and then developed all the symptoms of covid, I have had a fever myself the past few days that won't seem to break. </p>
<p>I know I've had covid before because I was slightly ill and feeling down with a cough and sore throat last fall. </p>
<p>I think one of the biggest lies is that covid immunity wanes. <strong>It doesn't, but if the spike protein itself is being continually manufactured and attacking the body of the vaccinated person and the people living with/around them, we will see increases in "covid" as a result of this.</strong></p>
<p>It seems quite an ironic twist of fate. The doomers treat all of us that just want life to continue as it was before as walking biological bombs, just for they themselves to get "vaccinated" and become walking biological bombs themselves!</p>
