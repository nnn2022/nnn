        <p>It’s not at all a study of people out in the world, it’s just lab experiments of a dummy wearing a mask. Why is this science now that gets to literally mandate how we live and breathe?</p>

        <p>Also, has anyone been able to explain what happens to these “Covid infected aerosols” that land on your mask, and you now breathe them in over and over, and then again the next day when you pick the dirty mask up out of your car to wear in the next store.... like are we just supposed to ignore this part of the “science”? If nothing is sticking to the masks then logically they aren’t preventing you from spreading anything, so then aerosols DO stick to the mask, so then all a mask is doing is being a Covid swifter sweeper to catch all the aerosols and keep them by your face to breathe in!</p>

        <p>I believe that point might be that if these “Covid infected aerosols” land on your mask, without the mask they would have landed in an area which would open you up to infection. And really, people shouldn’t be constantly wearing dirty masks, and should wash them when they can, and seal them in a bag or something when not in use. You’ve also forgotten that wearing a mask irregardless of what you’ve said in your comment would decrease the chances of giving Covid to someone else.</p>

        <p>Yes but people aren’t always using a clean mask and the disposable ones (that are often reused as well) are having a terrible impact on the environment: https://nypost.com/2020/12/28/more-than-1-5b-masks-will-pollute-oceans-this-year-report/</p>
<p>If aerosols end up by your face without a mask, you could breathe them in and send them out. There are mechanisms in place in your nose to prevent infections. Also the overall “viral load” I keep reading about should be quite low. Now place the aerosols close to your face where you constantly breathe them in, and add all things you’ve picked up by touching surfaces and then touching your mask, add in all the germs from surfaces your mask has touched, why is this better than no mask?</p>
<p>Maybe in a perfect sterile environment, where everyone is properly trained in mask usage, only wears them for an hour or so at a time, then disposes them to be recycled and immediately decomposed into the earth where they will be fertilizer for all things organic, masks pros would outweigh the negatives.</p>
<p>In the real world though, not these “studies” with dummies in a lab, masks have never been shown to decrease infection. There are even studies showing that compared to groups not wearing them, they have increases of infection. They are causing pollution, ruining the development of the next generation (babies rely on facial cues and watching mouths to learn to communicate), cutting off deaf people from their best means of communication, causing depression and anxiety in kids forced to wear them in schools, causing rashes and “mask mouth”, bacterial pneumonia, some study even linked masks to lung cancer. Even a little bit less oxygen causes stress, stress reduces the immune system, causing you to get sicker easier. Everyone wearing their masks incorrectly and reusing and touching them could be getting sick easier. More sickness is more spread! </p>
<p>There hasn’t been a single instance in the US comparing state to state that shows the mask mandates have helped compared those without them, the virus does what viruses do and runs its course in similar fashion throughout the country. The media hates on Florida and Sweden constantly, but if you really look deep at their numbers, they’ve done fine! Benefits of forced masks do not even come close to outweighing the negative impacts. I agree with Fauci circa early 2020 when he said they just make people feel better, but they don’t actually help anything!</p>

        <p>I know it's not really the case, but I could see some guys sitting around an office:  <br>
"OK, we got 'em wearing two masks, what else do we got to fuck 'em up?"  <br>
"Earmuffs!"  <br>
"Genius! Get a press release sent out - say earmuffs with two masks are safer and recommended"</p>
