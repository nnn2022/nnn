    <strong>What’s the deal?</strong>
    <p><p>A genuine question as my head spins, speaking specifically about the virus itself and not the social control built around it: shouldn’t this virus have spread and burned itself out through most of the population by now? Like the flu does every year? Is seems like at this point it should still be around, but in a low-key, always-gonna-be-around-to sneak-up-on-a-few-people-who-don’t-have-the-natural-defenses-for-it kind of way? </p>
<p>But it’s still all over the place, maybe even more prevalent (if you believe Los Angeles)? Is it the numbers being completely manipulated and/or lumped together with normal flu/ pneumonia? </p>
<p>Is it because of lockdowns and just basically drawing the whole thing out from what should have been something that lasted a few months to this? </p>
<p>Is it truly so “novel” that it really behaves SO differently than any other respiratory virus? </p>
<p>Is it one of these reasons? All of them? Or is it something else? What gives? </p>
<p>Like many people on the internet, I’m not a medical professional. Unlike many people on the internet, I’m happy to admit that I don’t really understand all the ins and out of viruses and respiratory diseases. But I do have common sense, critical thinking skills, am fairly well read, etc. So... wtf? What is the got-damn deal? </p>
<p>Constantly hearing about it and all the bs is so exhausting. I’m so dooooone.</p></p>

        <p>I think it's the government doing lockdowns and mask mandates that's slowing the virus's spread and keeping it around longer. If they hadn't done that, the virus would be long gone by now.</p>

        <p>And I guess that was the original thinking behind “two weeks to flatten the curve”, “not overwhelm the healthcare system”, but that seems to have backfired.</p>

        <p>I think the virus has become endemic, and is just a new strain of the flu. Cases can go up or down, based on how the PCR test is done. If they want more cases, increase the cycles, less cases decrease the cycles. Most people probably got exposed to it and defeated it naturally. The dead cells remain in the body, when the test is conducted, the person becomes covid positive. </p>
<p>Science can be wrong, blindly trusting science is bad. Remember when lobodomies, and doctors recommended cigarettes?</p>

        <p>Covid is still around just like the flu and common cold and yes those things ARE being recategorized as covid. Even though the flu comes in seasons it is still around in the off season, just to a lesser degree. Exactly like covid. The lockdowns have done nothing. Mainstream media likes to attribute and drop in covid to restrictions and any rise they blame on people just trying to live their lives. But it all has just been the natural ebb and flow of viruses.</p>

        <p>That makes sense. Yet as a collective humanity, we’ve never paid so much attention to the daily natural ebb and flow of viruses, so now it seems so “out of control”.</p>

        <p>Exactly, it is "out of control." Mankind has never had control over nature and we never will. No amount of lockdowns will ever stop a virus. China locked people in their homes and let them starve to death but it still wasn't enough to stop covid. Even killing people isn't enough to slow down a virus so anything short of a world wide genocide wouldn't be enough. Obviously that would defeat the entire point.</p>
