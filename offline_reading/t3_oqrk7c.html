        <p>That is a much bigger deal because it means they can't be extended at the last minute next week, which means there is likely to be a wave of mortgage defaults. I'm not sure what the consequences will be though, I've tried to study this issue but I'm still working my through it trying to comprehend the relationship between the REPO market and the amount of cash in the banks themselves. </p>
<p>People seem to be focusing on the idea that there is "too much liquidity", but that liquidity is not accessible by banks anymore unless they want to take massive losses through inflation.</p>

        <p>Yeah I’m interested to see what they do as they’re also pushing for this third/fourth wave delta variant bullshit and some US cities are enacting restrictions again. The eviction moratorium won’t be extended, we still have significant unemployment from the last shutdowns that they’re trying to clamp down on, and rising inflation so they can’t easily print more money and pay people to stay home again. More shutdowns seems like it would be the final nail in the coffin and a potential political/economic disaster.</p>

        <p>&rt;The eviction moratorium won’t be extended,</p>
<p>Which means that the remaining people who haven't paid rent this whole time will have to move. </p>
<p>&rt;we still have significant unemployment from the last shutdowns that they’re trying to clamp down on,</p>
<p>Which means that people will either have to accept shittier jobs or move - if they haven't already. </p>
<p>&rt;and rising inflation so they can’t easily print more money and pay people to stay home again. </p>
<p>Unemployment is what people pay into. The federal government subsidized it because some states max it out to absurdly low numbers, and self-employed people weren't otherwise eligible. </p>
<p>&rt;More shutdowns seems like it would be the final nail in the coffin and a potential political/economic disaster.</p>
<p>At this point, the only people who I know are still on unemployment, and self-employed conservatives who have been milking it just because "everyone else gets it, why can't I" - and none of us know who "everyone else" is, just that they're apparently out there. No one wants to work the food jobs? Apparently this was only for teenagers, and I don't see their teenagers working, so I guess we're at an impasse.</p>
<p>Not saying that you necessarily share their views, but it's very tiring. So political, and no nuance.</p>

        <p>There is not going to be a wave of mortgage defaults. The overwhelming majority of mortgages are backed by Ginnie, Fannie, and Freddie - over 90% - and they have rules in place to make it easier than ever to modify the loan to add a couple of years to the mortgage.</p>
<p>Anyone who was part of the mortgage moratorium had two great options: accept the mod, or sell the house at a great price. Most people took one of those two. The types of people who are just going to keep their payments lapse are both few, and likely going to abandon houses in such terrible shape that only contractor investors are interested. There won't be a lot of those.</p>

        <p>I hear you. But I personally don't see it happening. We last bought a house at the tail end of 2019, and the adage, "if not this house, then you'll find a better one next month" has not stayed true. Prices are way up.</p>
<p>This isn't '08. People weren't handed out ARM loans with a $24k income on a $600k home, since then. The underwriting standards are strict, and recent originations from the agencies (Fannie, Freddie, Ginnie - the 90%+ of all loans) are better than ever. Great credit scores, great DTIs, great LTVs. People aren't going to be foreclosing en masse. I see no precursors at this time to make me believe that it's possible.</p>

        <p>I still just wound up canceling my family’s cruise. We were supposed to be having a big family reunion cruise in 2020 and that obviously got canceled but we had the option of refund or reschedule when possible with several hundred dollars of cruise credit. Some chose the refund but a lot of us hoped that things would eventually get better and we’d be able to do the cruise. Well I called the travel agent the other day to get some more information on what was going on and if that particular cruise line was requiring vaccinations. The info I got was they weren’t requiring them but we would have to be masked in all public areas, would not be allowed to attend any of the shows, and would have separate times when we would be allowed to use the pools. Did not sound like anything I wanted to give my time or money to so I just had them cancel and refund me. This whole time I was really rooting for the cruise and travel industry to be able to make a comeback but not anymore, not if they are going to be having these policies.</p>

        <p>Because cruise ships had outbreaks and no one wanted to let them dock, including the US. I think we can all agree that being stuck on a ship with no way of getting out is a shitty place to be.</p>
<p>Do we want to repeat that? According to Florida, why not. And at this point I think it's fine, but they need to guarantee that they'll let she ships dock and let the passengers disembark, since they didn't before so they don't have a great track record.</p>

        <p>The CDC can issue a guidance that they ask particular parties to follow. It's not a law. This particular lawsuit came out because a cruise line wanted to check vaccination status, citing the CDC as to why, and Florida refused to let them.</p>
<p>And I've explained why the CDC made that decision, and I agree it doesn't explicitly answer or address your comment, but isn't that pretty important? It's not that the cruise industry wants less business. They just don't want to be stuck with a covid ship that Florida won't allow to dock like they did before.</p>

        <p>Right the CDC issues guidance that folks can follow and governments can base policy on, they don't themselves mandate anything, so to say this lawsuit strikes down CDC mandates it a completely empty statement for this headline to make.</p>
<p>Again I'm not even arguing whether it's a good or bad thing, I agree that folks should be able to disembark a vessel with COVID cases. I don't think you'll hear anyone on this sub saying they're afraid of people getting off of boats.</p>
<p>Would you say it's a fair compromise that cruise ships not require vaccines, and then people are allowed to leave the boat afterwards? I think everyone over here is totally cool with that... Sounds like an awful lot of people being left alone.</p>

        <p>I'm fine with whatever the companies decide, and their clients can decide how they feel about it.</p>
<p>I'm saying that it's the cruise companies who wanted to check for vaccine status, and weren't allowed to per Florida EO. So the appealed to the CDC guidance and said, we want to check for vaccine status because the CDC said it's a good idea, so please let us.</p>
<p>So really it's Florida making it difficult for the companies to conduct business by preventing them from making their own rules. And the reason they're making those rules is because Florida didn't let them dock a year ago with a covid ship, so they were stuck without being able to dock. So I don't blame them, you clearly can't trust the FL government.</p>

<p>Don't listen to these shills and liars.  This is a complete and total fabrication.</p>
<p>The case was about a CDC guideline saying that unless the cruise ship companies could prove that 95% of passengers were vaccinated, they had to first run the cruise with no actual passengers, only "volunteers", to prove they could "prevent covid" or some foolishness.</p>
<p>So they were basically required to do two runs of every cruise, a "test" run, and then the actual cruise.</p>

        <p>You do realize this is only lifting a temporary stay by the very same court that implemented the stay last week while they proceed to trial? There’s no “winners” or “losers” here, this is all typical pre-trial activity until the court comes to a decision.</p>

        <p>And if you want big government out of a company's ability to mandate vaccines, then let's see you put your money where your mouth is.  Let's see you commit.</p>
<p>Let's do away with the right to privacy and protected medical health information.  I want cruises to mandate ALL medical history of every single passenger.  I want to know if you've got or have had in the past any medical issues at all and I want your entire medical history made available for the entire crew and passengers on the cruise.</p>
<p>Have children?   I want their medical history made public as well.</p>
<p>The government has laws in place protecting that information on the federal level, but you yourself said you want big daddy government out of it so let's see your medical history.  Let's see you agree to forgo your right to privacy and post that shit right here on Reddit for us to see.</p>
