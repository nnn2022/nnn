    <strong>Using the term 'new normal' was a mistake. 'Temporary normal' would be more suitable.</strong>
    <p><p>I feel that the term 'new normal' is just unfair. People have lost so much of their life to these restrictions and to just normalise that as the way things are was a terrible idea. This loss, like any, needs time to be grieved, accepted and most importantly, we need to remember that <em>life won't be like this forever</em>. Loss changes things, yes (I'm sure we've all learned a lot from the last months), but it doesn't cause life to be miserable forever.</p>
<p>However, the term 'new normal' discards that. It just says that we need to accept this as forever immediately and it's weak to be upset about this. Or selfish to want your normal back. But it isn't. People have tried to normalise this because they don't want to be uncertain. They think that if they accept this as normal they won't be upset and uncertain anymore. But it's not true.</p>
<p>We all must accept that this <em>isn't</em> normal. And that's ok. It's ok to feel uncertain, upset, anxious, confused, scared, and to miss normality. It's ok to not feel that this is the way humans should live. We shouldn't have a normal forced on us that we don't want, and just be told to accept that this is the way now.</p>
<p>'Temporary normal' would be a far better phrase. This madness is our everyday right now but it isn't normal and it isn't forever. Heck, maybe the phrase shouldn't even involve the word normal...</p>
<p>Anyways, what are your thoughts on the term? I hate it, as you probably figured, but I'd like to know if you guys feel the same way.</p>
<p>Edit: To all you guys in the comments saying that this is fully intended by the government - I know it is. But to get people on board, we have to first start by speaking to them in their language, before they start to understand and can help us fight! Remember, most people will write you off as a conspiracy theorist if you start by telling them this was fully intentional, so to get people to understand we need to first get them to listen!</p>
<p>Ps. Thank you all for making me feel like I'm not crazy or alone in how I feel!</p></p>

        <p>Oh no I know that! It is being used as manipulation. It wasn't a mistake on their part, it was completely intentional. But us adopting that phrase and believing it was a mistake. A very grave one, quite possibly...</p>

        <p>Most people are brainwashed. There was nothing to stop people from adopting its usage. It’s everywhere, coordinated.  Like the Build Back Better phrasing. Also intentional. </p>

        <p>It's sad that more aren't fighting, but that doesn't mean everyone who doesn't fight agrees. They'll fight if it becomes forever, but most people are just waiting for the magic vaccine. Idk maybe we need to make people more aware of us so they don't feel so alone in disagreeing. Posters, leaflets in the letterbox, awareness campaign might be a start. I agree some people are totally psychotic and want to keep things this way, I guess they're either blinded by fear or want everyone else to be as miserable as them. We can only hope my friend, hope and fight!</p>

        <p>It was the reason I got into all this. I hated it from day one but hearing Sophie Raworth use the term on the BBC news made me realised how ingrained the idea was. I knew the BBC were under stringent Ofcom guidelines dictating what they could and couldn’t say on the news but I realised then that there was no interest from our leaders to ever let this thing stop. I realised that people were accepting it as a permanent way of living instead of a temporary inconvenience for the greater good. </p>
<p>If normal is constant surveillance, authoritarianism, paranoia, coercion and censorship then I want no part in it.</p>

        <p>The normal we once knew is gone forever plain and simple. this "New" Normal is a manufactured one from those who are trying to reshape our global status qou.</p>
<p>This "New" Normal is not one we want. No one on this sub wants the normal that's coming.</p>

        <p>It really is these things! Our language here tries to get rid of the uncertainty by saying it's now 'normal'. That tries to soften the blow. Gradually pushing for the language you're saying is probably the best way to ease more people on board - we start by talking to them in their language and gradually get them to understand ours.</p>

        <p>Really I just feel the cost is too high. There is too much damage being caused, and we will always fail to control respiratory viruses since they spread through air. I've seen lots of people hurt by the effects of our response, but I only know people who know people who have had a mild to moderate bit of virus.</p>
