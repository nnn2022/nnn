    <strong>DAE feel guilt when experiencing a shred of happiness</strong>
    <p><p>I've been an on and off poster since finding this place and whilst my views have remained the same (Became a skeptic around May and finally saw the truth in October of last year), my mood has changed rapidly. From July-October I was in an rough place mentally and seeing an counsellor and when the second Lockdown came on the 31st of October in UK, I went into an even lower mood despite doing a load of nice things to balance it out. I lost my job and other pressures of Lockdown coupled with the monotony of each day made me at times despair filled and filled my head with suicidal thoughts. The third Lockdown this January was a strange one in that whilst initially on that breaking point, I suddenly felt a lot more content and even at times euphoric.</p>
<p>I know, I should be thankful and I should acknowledge that many others can't share the feeling. But at the same time, I'm finding that whilst I feel content, I fear I'm at risk of being desensitised to it all and becoming ignorant to the whole thing. It at times scares me and I have a feeling of ending up on a path of senility. I still bend the rules of them, see my few family whenever I can and get out of the house but at the same time, the idea of living like this forever with no end in sight and longings for the past, checkered as it was, are strong but i'ts conflicting in that I don't want to lose the good feelings yet remain down to earth and not in some fantasy bubble. I'm still jobless and have no purpose yet I feel trapped in that dream at times.</p>
<p>Is this a problem? I'm not expecting anyone to read this or care but at the same time, an answer would help me.</p></p>

        <p>No you just see how ignorant others are and it bothers you what I recommend is that you stop concerning yourself with the beliefs of others and focus on yourself start doing meditation exercise maybe learn to cook or something like that also learn how to get around the oppressive rule your country/local law has set in place</p>

        <p>I feel no guilt and you shouldn't either. We all have our ways of trying to remain sane in an insane world. I used to feel guilty about being happy around my chronically depressed mother, but after  a lot of consideration, I decided I'd do the people around me a lot more good being wind in their sails rather than an anchor dragging then down. Commiserating and complaining is good for nothing. Keep on keeping on, cause somebody's gotta carry the fire.</p>
