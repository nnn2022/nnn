<p>Happened in Indy also. 4 or 5 people at the practice facility tested positive early Friday morning. They retested them that afternoon and they were negative. So they announced they must have been false positives. How exactly they determined they were in fact false positives and not false negatives was not explained. The concept that there could be multiple other false positives wasn’t discussed either. How convenient.</p>

        <p>The so-called "test" does the amplification thing (far too) much more than any other proper tests and thus picks up stuff that isn't there or is dead: <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-54000629">https://www.bbc.com/news/health-54000629</a> That is why the magical "scary virus" can teleport itself around the galaxy like some Star Trek captain meddling in the affairs of other people. And if they wore muzzles, they were MORE likely to catch the god virus : <a href="https://thefederalist.com/2020/10/12/cdc-study-finds-overwhelming-majority-of-people-getting-coronavirus-wore-masks/">https://thefederalist.com/2020/10/12/cdc-study-finds-overwhelming-majority-of-people-getting-coronavirus-wore-masks/</a>  And in Australia, the government website states that the "tests" are all but fraudulent : <a href="https://off-guardian.org/2020/09/05/australian-govts-own-website-admits-covid-tests-are-totally-unreliable">https://off-guardian.org/2020/09/05/australian-govts-own-website-admits-covid-tests-are-totally-unreliable</a> But the main thing is that you MUST keep OBEYING the false narrative and WORSHIP that little old (fictitious) "scary virus : <a href="https://soundcloud.com/getout_mc/scary-virus">https://soundcloud.com/getout_mc/scary-virus</a> ... and wear a muzzle to show that you are a true believer.</p>

        <p>Maybe the false positive narrative is the next big thing now that reinfection isn't causing a big enough panic. They'll say, sure you had the virus in March but it may have been a false positive! Even if you've already had a positive test, you can't assume that you're immune! Test results are meaningless so instead we'll just have to assume everyone is a potential positive!</p>

        <p>I think he has it still and miraculously claims he doesn't have it just in time for the Georgia game at home in Alabama. He's ensuring he still keeps his perfect football record of never missing a game. May seem trivial to most of us in a pandemic but you would be amazed at what some people find important.</p>
