        <p>180,000 people who died with covid, or had it written on their death certificate without a positive test, with 90% of deaths over 65 with 95% of those having pre existing health conditions.</p>
<p>Old people die, especially ones in bad health.</p>
<p>8k people die a day in the US under normal circumstances. That means in 9 months we have over 2 million deaths. Get some perspective on the situation.</p>

        <p>Just wondering, how old are you or your parents that you consider people over 65 to be old and ok with their death? Life expectancy in the US is 78. </p>
<p>Also (trusting your 2M dead figures) that means covid would account for almost 10% of deaths.... That is a lot. For <strong>perspective</strong> 146k people die a year of strokes. Don't you think if we could prevent strokes from killing anyone we would try?</p>

        <p>Most people that died were over 75, accounting for something like 85 or more percent of deaths. You can look up the numbers on the cdc site yourself, or whatever source you want.</p>
<p>So yeah, I think we shouldn't fuck the rest of us for years (or decades) to save people who aren't likely to live much longer regardless.</p>
<p>10% bullshit, again. You're assuming none of those people would have died, which is hilariously untrue.</p>
<p>And I think if people pushed a moral panic over them we would. And we do already try, but sometimes shit happens and people die. </p>
<p>Did we attract the trolls, or just the idiot brigade today? It's impossible to tell with you people.</p>

        <p>Over 75 is 55-60% of Covid deaths. You only get to 85% when you include 65-74. Which, again my point was, is not that old. Which is why I asked your experience with parents or other personal relations in that age bracket.</p>
<p>200k is excess deaths. Meaning, yes people who would not have died otherwise.</p>
<p>I've lurked for a long time. Just felt like trying to converse today. Nobody gets anywhere if people can't talk to and listen to people they disagree with.</p>

        <p>77% in the US, according to the cdc. So I was off, but less than you were. Try again.</p>
<p>And yes, it's the age where you start dying from health conditions.</p>
<p>200k is not excess deaths, I'd love to see you prove that. It's people who died that either tested positive or had their deaths attributed to covid.</p>
<p>You're right, because people like you can't understand facts, or numbers.</p>

        <p>Can you link that CDC table? Maybe my CDC data was bad, but I'm staring at it right now.</p>
<p>I'm also staring at the CDC website that shows 190,912-253,841 excess deaths since 2/1/2020. I took 200k because A)it's easier math and B) it's a figure I've seen reported in other reputable sources.</p>
<p>Again, I'm trying to talk this through. At the end of the day I don't know that numbers will convince either of us. Everyone's scared now, sure you can say I'm a doomer who's scared of catching the flu and having a cough and I can say you're a covidiot who's scared of wearing a piece of cloth, but those things don't help anyone really understand. </p>
<p>Someone's gotta take the first step, so here's my fears: increased consolidation of megacorps and the death of small businesses, unnecessary deaths of friends, family, and strangers globally, the impact on children's education, the increased rate of depression and self harm, the likelihood for domestic abuse to go unnoticed or unreported, a recession and loss of housing for thousands of people.</p>
<p>I'm doing what I can to mitigate those things. Maybe you don't think I'm going about it the right way. Maybe you think all of those things are fine. I don't know, but I'm trying to understand. What're you scared of? As a SPECIES we can't keep up the us vs them (who can't understand facts or numbers).</p>

        <p>Regardless of everything else, we share the same concerns. But your solution is let's lock down and make those concerns more of an issue. Mine is we get back to normal.</p>
<p>Those are viewpoints that don't mesh, because yours don't work in the real world.</p>
<p>The sooner we open up and stop scaring the shit out of people, the better. I guarantee if we did, we wouldn't see a massive increase in deaths.</p>

        <p>I'm glad we agree on something. </p>
<p>You may be right about not having an increase in deaths, I don't think so and I certainly don't think you can guarantee it, but it's a hypothesis nonetheless. So would you be ok with the current mortality rate indefinitely? </p>
<p>And if you don't want to continue this conversation I get it. Hopefully I've shared a POV that shows that we have a lot in common even if we have different solutions. But I just wanted to say that deaths are the easiest metric to track and discuss but there <strong>are</strong> serious long term complications that we aren't even talking about and that includes people far younger than the age groups we discussed previously. </p>
<p>I guess I can summarize it like this:</p>
<p>Is Covid-19 a problem?</p>
<p>If yes, do we A) take steps to solve it or B) "get back to normal"</p>
<p>If you've got better steps to take for A than medical professionals prescribe then we are all listening. But if not, I don't see how B is anything other than resignation. In which case there is still a new normal, it just involves hundreds of bodies a day.</p>

        <p>I am right.</p>
<p>Look at Florida and Texas, etc VS California, etc.</p>
<p>Yes, people are going to die. This isn't going away. It's already endemic. We have to live with it.</p>
<p>"long term complications" like from the flu too. Try another argument.</p>
<p>Step a is go back to normal and let people judge their own circumstances so we don't crater the economy and kill/harm more people than covid is.</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>We won't have hundreds of deaths a day, once this gets through the real first wave everywhere. It'll be more like the flu.</p>
<p>If you can't understand that, then I feel bad for you. But I can't comprehend your irrational fear of this one disease.</p>

<p>I also don't understand how you are so dismissive of an "argument" by comparing it to the flu. You know we have a vaccine for the flu? You know people in many countries wear masks when they think they have the flu? 12k-61k die a year from the flu, that's WITH A VACCINE what do you think those numbers would be like without? When we have a vaccine for Covid-19 you can bet your ass I'll gladly treat it like the flu.</p>

        <p>&rt; You know we have a vaccine for the flu?</p>
<p>and 60k people died of it last year.</p>

<p>cool, so healthy people don't? Glad we agree.</p>
<p>&rt;12k-61k die a year from the flu, that's WITH A VACCINE what do you think those numbers would be like without?</p>
<p>I...don't know, and don't really care. Shocker, an 93 year old dies, might have been the flu, or a heart attack, or the cancer they had. People fucking die, and you apparently don't get that.</p>
<p>&rt;there's the submission I thought was there.</p>
<p>u wot m8?</p>
<p>You're the coward who can't stand living life normally, thinking we need masks and lockdowns and to ruin our lives over this disease. Talk about submitting to it.</p>
<p>I want to go back to normal, and not be afraid. What the fuck level of projection is this? You trying to run a movie theater?</p>
<p>This isn't going away, even with a vaccine. At some point, you'll have to accept that this will come back next year, and the year after. And at some point, we'll accept it like we do the flu and say "Well, shit happens, people sometimes just die".</p>

        <p>Struck a chord huh?</p>
<p>Accept this and accept that. That's submission. We should try and cure cancer, prevent heart attacks and minimize flu deaths. We put guard rails on mountain roads, we have laws requiring seatbelts and helmets. Maybe you think we should just lay down and die. That's fine, you do that.</p>
<p>We've best diseases before. When was the last time your neighbor caught Ebola or H1N1? </p>
<p>If your life is ruined by a mask and a stay at home order which allows for: outdoor exercise, curbside pickup, to go and outdoor dining, and small gatherings then I'm the one who feels sorry for you. I do like the movie theater line though, that was funny.</p>

<p>Yes, I don't like the government expanding it's rules, and I guarantee the very second they do something you don't like you screech about it for months on end. I'm at least consistent, while you're a hypocrite.</p>

        <p>I also wait for daddy government to prevent terrorist attacks, maintain a Federal Reserve, prevent airplane crashes, monitor the food and drugs released to the public... because I'm not an expert in any of those things. Woe is me. Are you just an anarchist?</p>
<p>Ahh yes the classic reddit bets about viral mutations. I'll be sure to source you.</p>
<p>I never said my life was ruined. I'm trying to solve a problem. I came here trying to understand a different viewpoint than mine to find some common ground. </p>
<p>You're POV is that the government should never expand its rules? See I think that government, especially as one of the most influential nations in the world, is more nuanced than that. Some government expansion is good some is bad. </p>
<p>Anyway, this has been enlightening. You go out and show the virus you don't care how many it kills it's just the <em>new normal</em>.</p>

        <p>&rt; Over 75 is 55-60% of Covid deaths. You only get to 85% when you include 65-74. Which, again my point was, is not that old. Which is why I asked your experience with parents or other personal relations in that age bracket.</p>
<p>There are people in that age bracket who are <em>not</em> going to live long though.  Because they are very unhealthy.</p>
<p>And when Covid sweeps by, it is exactly the weakest who succumb.</p>
<p>It doesnt kill a "random selection" of 65 year olds.  It kills the most unhealthy ones.  ANd those are exactly the ones who <em>dont</em> have 30 years left in them.</p>

        <p>You're assuming none of those people would have died anyway for one. You're also missing the other 700k people that die in the other 3 months, so assuming you're right (which you aren't) it's less than 10%. Three, let's wait for the all cause mortality report for the year and go from there.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure what goalposts I'm moving? This whole time I've just been making the claim that there was a large increase in deaths this year compared to previous years and the most probable reason for that is COVID. The charts are not comparing one state to another state because that doesn't make any sense. It's comparing the deaths in each state against numbers reported for previous years in that same state.</p>

        <p>Who's to say that even did anything? And that's 200,000 who died with covid. 95% had other comordities. So really it's more like 10,000 died purely from covid. Which sucks sure but is hardly worth shutting the country down over.</p>

        <p>Guess we shouldn't worry about AIDS then since it doesn't actually kill you, it just lets other things kill you. That 95% of people that died with co-morbidities and COVID? The vast vast vast majority of those people would still be alive if they didn't get the virus.</p>

        <p>Wouldve died pretty soon after. Forgive me of I dont fret because a 90 year old died of this instead of the flu later this year. Or a morbidly obese man with hypertension. Comparing this to AIDs is absurd and you know it.</p>

        <p>It’s not. If it wasn’t for COVID, most of these people would still be alive. The US has had a 10% increase in year over year deaths.</p>
