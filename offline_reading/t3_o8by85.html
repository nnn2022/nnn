    <strong>Is isolation affecting your mind?</strong>
    <p><p>I am autistic, so I depended on structured groups for friends and social interaction. I am also very disabled.  The thing is I have LOTS of friends, I am always behind on writing an email, a card etc, except I have lost some , but all these friends are online or long distance [moved away or I moved away] There's no close friends in my town. Certainly no one close enough to ask to even go meet in a park masked up if that is what they want. </p>
<p>I do have a husband so this could be worse and we are a closely bonded couple that enjoys each other's company a lot, so if I am feeling the effects of isolation, what about all those who live alone? I have not seen or talked to any other person more then 10 minutes in person, in 18 months.</p>
<p>I see some group members who have dropped things off at my house. I have seen doctors, nurses, store clerks, the mail man, neighbors in the hall, and parking lot, building manager, various clerks and baggers in stores, librarians etc. I found a health food store woman, who is against masks, and I told her I still wear masks from lungs, but the vaxx is BS, and think she was surprised.</p>
<p>I told husband I will rejoin society in late fall, I have to, because mentally I am being affected by so much isolation IRL. We do not have family or children. I also have realized how our lack of close friends, one close enough to hang out at their house instead of just sharing group participation with, is a serious problem. </p>
<p>I consider moving but starting over is hard. Social disconnection was already a serious problem. I am almost deaf too, so I know that affected things socially as well over the years.</p>
<p>This county does have some conservatives in it, and I think the rural areas has to have the most unvaxxed people in them, I am planning to eat out in little towns like that and we have trip planned when heat goes down--I get sick in heat. </p>
<p>Even normal happy people look depressed to me now, these are folks even with some friends and family. There's almost a manic quality to some while others are disappearing from my groups [on Zoom] Like people are dropping out of society. Maybe some smart ones are bugging out, now wondering if a friend who ghosted me is escaping overseas but she could just be a Covid disciple who cut me off. Some surely are having bad vaxx reactions they don't want to talk about. </p>
<p>People in stores look depressed AF.  For someone who has depression problems even in the "before" times, this is not good. I have hobbies and keep mind active, art, poetry, writing, etc. I wonder how all the single people are going to do? What about people who went to groups but had no close friends or recently moved? I have a friend with cancer who has NO ONE. The social workers are picking up the pieces there.</p>
<p>I think they worked on destroying social ties a long time ago, the economic nomadism, even for working class to move to get jobs. I moved a few times just to avoid the streets, the decaying families, where Mom and Dad Boomer never had empathy or understanding for the extreme poverty that came for their young, and being called a "loser" for decades took a toll on too many of us, the lack of social connection, and empathy. It makes me sad we have no friends to even see in this, and that means something about life needs changed. My husband's best friend could have visited us, but is a Covid follower and disciple and got vaccinated. His health has sunk to new lows. I tried to warn him.</p>
<p>There's so much sadness out there because a bunch of stupid asshole elites wanted more power and money.</p></p>

        <p>I never isolated, but the month I was out of work last year fucked with me. Bad. Like I lost my sense of purpose. My reason for being. And that was only 30 days of no real isolation. I still had my wife and 3 of my kids living here. I was never lonely.</p>
<p>I can't even fathom what over a year would be like. Or even 30 days of actual isolation. I don't know that I would have survived it to be honest.</p>
<p>Between this and the lack of in person social interaction brought about by school closures, we're in for some dark times for mental health. World wide.</p>

        <p>It's terrible you went through that. I hope you have work back. I think even being home all the time even if you have a family having no other people to talk or communicate with on any real level is enough to mess people up.  I know if I was not married and lived alone, I would not have survived this so understand. I worry about them doing more lock downs. I am not sure how I am going to make or get friends or a community again. I fear even the groups I am in banning the unvaxxed. The mental health results of this will be felt for years to come, what they have done to the children is criminal.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I'm good now. Gainfully employed and also with a renewed sense of purpose (we're leaving Oregon, lots you do to make that happen). </p>
<p>I used to be a care provider and many of the folks I supported have autism, so I understand your predicament as much as a neuraltypical can. My heart to you and your broken routines. May I offer a suggestion? Don't try and find a community to fit you- make one. I guarantee you aren't alone. Doesn't have to be centered around the spectrum, but maybe it can be. I'm pretty much a loner with the same 4 friends I've had for 20 years, so I wouldn't know how to advise you get started, but I think there could be a lot of value in such a community.</p>

        <p>Glad you are doing better now and getting out of Oregon, the forest fires and rest in Oregon sound like hell. It's great you worked with the autistic. I am not sure how to make a community. I did try to find fellow autistics, even tried to start a group years ago but it fell through, I know one man who is autistic in community. I do belong to an online one but most live at least an hour away. Glad you have those 4 friends.</p>

        <p>I live alone by choice. I am kind of a hermit, again by choice. I find the key is to create. Create anything, write, paint, bead, sculpt something. Learn new things. Try a new language, do spiritual work find something that interests you.  Being your own friend is an art. ;)</p>

        <p>Dont feel too bad OP, most of the times i really isolate myself, it's cus i don't want to bring the mood down for others, &amp; it's less exhausting to be myself where i can be miserable, whereas being fake happy cus of societal pressure do not be such a downer </p>
