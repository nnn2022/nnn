        <p>I don't understand how getting rid of everything that brings people joy in life is supposed to help with social progress. Honestly I'm completely lost on this one. All the activities we're not allowed to do are things that bring people together and help us relate to each other and understand each other better. Not to mention the lockdowns have had disproportionate  affect on vulnerable communities and have significantly widened the gap between the rich and poor. Theres no reason we can't go back to normal while still addressing the social  issues that plague society. What is wrong with these people? I just can't wrap my head around their way of thinking, it's completely fucked for lack of a better expression.</p>

        <p>This new normal is only a utopia for the rich and poverty has gone worse since small businesses and middle class businesses are going to shutdown and you don't get a sustainable economy by doing that, but I understand for the rich poverty is gone and we have a sustainable economy but that's only in the perspective of the rich because they can't see poverty getting worse they can't see economy becoming unsustainable, he won't see it because poverty and a bad economy don't exist for him.</p>

        <p>You are familiar with the guy?</p>
<p>I'm not as familiar with either of those things but I totally agree with what you said about  the modern monopolies.  I'm generally very pro free market but also realize think we need to go back and take a look at some of the stuff that they had to do back in the gilded age regarding monopolies.</p>
<p>It's probably because starting with Bill Clinton perhaps, both parties became both super anti-regulation in exchange for faster economic growth.  It's funny thinking about some this and other regulation in my head it seems at odds fiscal conservatism which I prefer, however most of the liberal fiscal policies seem unfavorable to me such as one of the big ones lately which is just raising taxes on the wealthy. Meanwhile, where I live people can't afford places to rent let alone own because of policies that benefit existing older home owners but politicians won't dare go after the people who get rich off the misery of others like that because they will get voted out.  It's a lot easier to pick on the statistically irrelevant number of billionaires to score political points than actually solve a problem like unaffordable housing.</p>

        <p>It kind of sounds like you might agree with more of it than I do.  Sure some of that sounds pretty reasonable I guess.</p>
<p>Did you miss the parts where he was literally saying rejecting the idea of the old normal which what this sub is trying to maintain?</p>
<p>Anyways, this guy is literally a screenwriter and he is good at what he does but I feel like I can see through what he makes sounds pretty hard to disagree with but trust me, it sounds very similar to the Great Reset "you will own nothing and be happy" stuff.
Anyways, I would have probably said "great reset" in the title because that is more directly tied to NNN instead of mentioning socialism.</p>

        <p>Yeah, that's my take as well.  I just live in a place that kind of epitomizes this kind of thinking so I'm more acutely aware of how these good intentions often lead to bad policy.  I realizing now it's hard to stop this talking point from turning into a politics discussion which isn't the goal of the sub.  Misguided government intervention is at the crux of what is forcing the NN however so it's hard to avoid the topic.</p>

        <p>I just thought this is important to show this because I read a lot of comments that are trying to write the great reset stuff as a conspiracy theory but who knows, maybe the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/great-reset/">World Economic Forum page</a> for it is a hoax itself.  While I realize that it's a stretch to think this is some orchestrated plot hatched from the beginning, it's foolish to not take the "Davos Agenda" at their word.</p>
<p>You can read about the WEF or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum#Annual_meeting_in_Davos">Davos event here.</a></p>
