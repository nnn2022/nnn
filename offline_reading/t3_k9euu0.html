<p>Six people died in Pfizer’s late-stage trial of the COVID-19 vaccine, the US Food and Drug Administration has revealed just hours after Britain became the first country in the world to roll out the vaccine.</p>
<p>But the deaths are said to raise no new safety issues or questions about the vaccine’s effectiveness because all represented events that occurred in the general population at a similar rate, the FDA concluded.</p>
<p>Its 53-page briefing report, released on Wednesday morning (Australian time) is the first detailed analysis of the vaccine trial by Pfizer and BioNTech, which found in November that its vaccine was 95 per cent effective in preventing coronavirus infections.</p>
<p>The documents revealed that two people who received the experimental vaccine had died during the trial. Four others who died were on a placebo.</p>

        <p>So this article tells me there were 43,000 participants or so...
https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine</p>
<p>2/43,000 or 1/21500... so with a population of 320 million we should expect to see 14,884 deaths, rounding up to the nearest whole number.</p>
<p>And how many death certificates have only covid listed as the cause of death again?</p>

        <p>And I’ll wager that these deaths will not be reported and/or be considered ok to the doomers. Unlike the thousands that are &amp; will occur from poverty, hunger, etc. because at least it’s not grandma from covid, yet it’s likely it will be grandma from the vaccine.</p>
