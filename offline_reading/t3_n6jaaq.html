<title>Why do people who are Pro-Vax automatically assume that the ones who don't want the Vax are unimformed and drowing theirselves in misinformation without actually asking the so called "Anti-Vaxxers" why they dont believe the Narrative we are being told?</title>

    <p><p>why do people who are "pro" anything that they havent researched,  quick to assume that anybody who denies the "Narrative" is a Conspiracy theorist without asking them why they believe a certain thing,</p>
<p>my boss (80F)  was upset slightly when i notified her i   ( 21M) did not feel comfortable getting the Vaccine, she then proceeded to say "well please dont listen to all of the misinformation online" etc, so i then informed her i had not and sent her a sentence from the pfizer briefing document on the Vaccine and she had nothing to say, still to this day we havent had a actual formal conversation about my stance, i have all the facts/medical articles backing my stance, "Some" people labled as Anti-Vax are some of the most well educated people i have ever met (online ofc) and some of them are definitely able to back up everything they say or believe,</p>
<p>Nontheless this day in age "Ignorance is Truly Bliss"</p></p>

        <p>Because pro-vaxxers believe all vaccines are 100% safe 100% of the time and the only reason anyone would doubt, even just a little bit, the safety of any vaccine, is if they're a nasty anti-vaxxer who wants to put an end to all vaccines and make it so everyone dies from diseases.</p>

        <p>I love how extremely far y’all have to reach to characterize this strawman pro-vaxxer lmfao</p>
<p>People definitely believe in the 100% success rate of 100% vaccines, yep. Definitely not people who are healthily skeptical instead of batshit crazy thinking that they, with their room temperature IQ, have found the missing link between it all</p>

        <p>The real reason... because if they accepted that we are actually educated and well informed and not the mindless child killing monsters they treat us to be that would crumble their entire platform... even when proof is served they are self blinded because otherwise they'd have to take a good long guilty look at how they had been so badly informed. More simply... it would shatter their cognitive dissonance.</p>

        <p>Psychologically we've been groomed for YEARS leading up to this. Remember like a year ago, or so, there was this huge social movement about vaccines (way before covid). It was instituting a type of inferior complex for those who vaccinated their kids - which at the time and for those diseases, with vaccines readily available with decades of research, was correct.</p>
<p>Subconsciously this set a predisposition in people's minds that anyone who went against 'vaccines' were complete morons and this rolled into the current climate. For years you can find examples all over.</p>
<p>I'd almost go as far as saying that each social media flavor of the week for the past decade, were purposely pushed to set some type of future prescendent for the bullshit were seeing now.</p>

        <p>“Mandatory minimum 15 years in a federal prison” I believe the average sentence served for rape is around 9.3 years, and the maximum for manslaughter is 15 years. So this airhead thinks that if you don’t get a vaccine or forge the document, that is a roughly equivalent crime as rape and manslaughter. Makes sense to me.</p>

        <p>This right here. It’s not a vaccine. They literally just changed the definition of vaccine in order to call this experimental gene therapy a vaccine. The world is not black-and-white and people that present black-and-white arguments are not worth your time. There’s three sides to every story, one side, the other side, and the truth.</p>

I'm not getting this fucking shot ever...I got the Rona and I have just as much immunity as someone who got the shot...until they can prove me wrong with proven medical data I ain't getting shit</p>
