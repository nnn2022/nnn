    <strong>How to deal with intense lockdown rage?</strong>
    <p><p>Hey guys. I’ve been coping the best I can with this insult to supermax life imprisonment that the NWO has given us since March. Meditation, exercise, stable sleep schedule, working on passion projects, studying, talking to friends DAILY, hell even a couple of therapy sessions. But my rage just keeps growing. For the past couple of months, I’ve felt constantly pissed off. Really pissed off. To the point where for hours, I fantasize about doing things to these fucking global elites &amp; their Gestapo that I can’t say on this forum for fear of being banned/watchlisted. It’s really scaring me that I’m turning into an extremist.</p>
<p>It also doesn’t help that everyone around me is basically a doomer. Whenever I go for a walk maskless, everybody looks at me either incredibly scared or angry, like I’m a crazy drunk wielding a gun trained directly on their heads. I’ve tried to talk to my parents about how I’m feeling, but they keep telling me, “nothing’s changed for you, so stop whining! Look for jobs!”</p>
<p>Children please.
1. My hope for turning around my social life, meeting awesome friends, &amp; dating beautiful, awesome women is gone because this lockdown will likely be permanent, this relegating me to being a shunned, outcasted incel soldier for the rest of my life against a world of NPC’s that hate me.
2. It’s very hard to get a job here now. You’re up against thousands of applicants for literally everything, all of whom have 20+ years of experience &amp; infinite certificates. As a recent uni grad, this hurts. And besides, the jobs that are here don’t have shit on living expenses. For reference, I live in Toronto.</p>
<p>Basically, imagine zoomer doomers, but 40 years older. That’s my parents (and basically my entire extended family).</p>
<p>I want to revolt in ways more effectively than simply just not wearing a mask in public places indoors, but I know that i don’t have the mental, physical, or emotional/psychological resources &amp; strength to do so right now successfully, so it’s not prudent to do so at all. I want to wait until the time is right, but I’m worried it’ll never be right &amp; things will just keep getting worse. Help me deal with my rage in the meantime. I’m so overwhelmed by it I find it very hard to function on a day-to-day basis. Even my parents call my walking “stomping.” Help me so that the rage doesn’t consume me.</p></p>

        <p>I went through a similar rage period in March. It does pass. This is my advice:</p>
<p>Option #1: Get the hell out of Toronto if you can afford to do so, move to an area where people hang out in bars like normal. </p>
<p>Option #2: Find your local underground. Go to Meetup groups that are in person and let people there know you think the restrictions are dumb as hell and you just want to hang out and meet people without getting shit on for it. Not in a ragey way, but in a "damn I miss normality" way. If Toronto is anything like Los Angeles, eventually you'll find out where the places are that are still open like normal.</p>
<p>3: No matter what you choose to do, give yourself media breaks. Look for online spaces that don't mention covid19 at all and hang out there. Stay the hell away from political spaces that are pro-lockdown, and give yourself breaks from this one too.</p>

        <p>A lot of people do seriously lose it when they first get redpilled and say or do things they can never take back and regret. We do not want you getting picked up, and "losing it" won't help anybody or yourself in this context.</p>
<p>If the mask crusade is wrecking your mental health dial it back to a few days a week. Try attending the rallies and meet real people, they're all nice and will empathize. Same goes for the internet, just ruins your mental health</p>
<p>As for anger, if you have the time you should prepare a fallback position for the worst case scenario. Good physical work there.</p>

        <p>Just channel the rage it into educating others or finding unique and creative ways of disseminating information, its the only thing that can make any kind of difference at this point anyway.</p>

<p>"There is a reason in striking down something that is replete. A man may ride his good fortune and commit evil, but you strike him down when that evil is replete. Thus, it may be said that using weapons is also the Way of Heaven. There are times when ten thousand people suffer because of the evil of one man. Therefore, in killing one man's evil you give ten thousand people life. In such ways, truly, the sword that kills one man will be the blade that gives others life."</p>

        <p>Can you take a class in martial arts of some kind to use up that angry energy?
Might be expensive but worth it. You’ll also be learning a skill. But idk if that’s something that is open to you or if that kind of thing has been totally shut down.</p>
<p>I agree with staying away from any media that talks about corona, and I know that’s tricky. If you can go out in Nature that might help, and I mean out of the city nature, out where it’s just the sky and the hills and the sun and the snow. Meditating out in nature is pretty calming.</p>

        <p>Anger and irritability stems from anxiety. I’m am pretty sure we are all anxious with the never changing nor ending “rona” fear mongering propaganda. Go outside and watch the birds. Go fishing  or take a hike on a trail. Just....turn off the phone most of the day if you can.</p>

        <p>Protest it. There have been plenty going on in Toronto I think. You’ll meet people who don’t think you’re crazy, coming from all sorts of backgrounds. It’s seriously cathartic. You might even meet a nice girl there!</p>

        <p>For me I dealt with it by finding ways to get around the lockdown. I found ways to continue doing my hobbies. This way it doesn't effect me so much other than having to wear masks in stores, so now it's not as big a deal as it was in the past. If that's not possible maybe develop some new hobbies?</p>

        <p>At least now you'll have motivation to move out as soon as you can.  Move across the country and find smarter people.  You can remember your parents similar to dumb friends you grew up with that you care for but have no interest in being close to any longer.</p>
