    <strong>People in my neighbourhood...</strong>
    <p><p>There are three people who walk around my neighbourhood everyday. Two appear to be some type of healthcare workers by the way they are dressed. Yellow transparent clothing cover, mask, face shield, blue gloves. The "patient" Ill call her has no mask and walks in-between them. I don't understand why they're dressed like that if she isn't sick. And if she is sick why is she out walking with no mask......? Should I get a picture of this ? Should I ask them what's going on lol?!</p></p>
