    <strong>It's important to be realistic</strong>
    <p><p>Don't get too much hope from MSM publishing headlines that make it LOOK like the tide is turning. It probably isn't.</p>
<p>How many of you have seen the NYT or CNN publish articles that suggest some widespread change to their lockdown opinion? Well, don't get too excited, folks, but those are just needles in haystacks. They are not going to do <em>anything</em>, and they'll probably just publish more fear porn later. Full normalcy, at this point, probably amounts to little more than a pipe dream. Now don't get me wrong, <em>this sub is one of the best COVID subs out there</em>, but one of the things I really don't like about it, and lockdown skepticism in general, is that we're being too realistic and generating too much false hope. They say the tide's turning, but I never see it around where I live.</p>
<p>You think the tide is turning, eh? Sorry if I'm sounding like u/neemarita right now, but <strong>I don't see the tide turning where I live.</strong> It's crazy as hell. The regulations where I live are nigh-impossible to flout (and believe me, I've tried). And like 75% of my friends are echoing that fear crap. Everybody wants me to wipe down my groceries and packages to "stay safe". I've tried explaining to them again and again that surface transmission is the we should least  be worried about, but do they care? Not at all! Everybody wants me to wear masks outdoors, even when, say, hiking in the woods, because "the trail is less than 6 feet wide". I've tried explaining to them again and again that that restriction is probably directed towards BLM protests and the like, but do they care? Not at all! And so, am I optimistic? Not at all! And why should I be, given that my area has no indications that I should be, at all, and I don't gauge much from Reddit or anyone I don't know on social media, just people I know around the country and world too.</p>
<p>It's important to be <em>realistic</em>, and not overly optimistic about what we're dealing with here. I assess what I see, carefully, and will not give in to narratives which are not rooted in reality. Will schools end up scrapping social distancing by the end of September once they find out it's not manageable? <strong>99% no.</strong> I hope it will be over someday but I have lost any and all hope. Giving up this power to our governments, pretending we have no rights as human beings, horrifies me to the core.  They'll probably continue that madness for as long as they want, or even close again. But NEVER reopening completely. Will the panic porn cease around Election Day? Well, to that I ask you, <strong>did it cease on July 31st</strong>? ([By the way, they might extend it] (https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattperez/2020/08/04/mcconnell-im-prepared-to-support-a-coronavirus-stimulus-bill-that-includes-600-unemployment-checks/).) Yesterday, Dr. Birx went insane and recommended people <em>wear masks in their own houses.</em> The WHO has also said on multiple occasions that we will never return to "old normal" again, worldwide. Yes, it's the WHO and we need to take everything they say with a huge grain of salt, but with coverage like <a href="http://archive.vn/2020.08.03-120630/https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/09/coronavirus-american-failure/614191/">this</a>, who knows which direction we are going in? Some professionals are even saying that we must socially distance for an unknown period of time, perhaps decades, and that we'll never be able to shake hands again. Will this "new normal" nonsense take place? As much as you won't like this, <strong>probably</strong>. We won't have any normality any longer. What will count as normality scares me. Giving governments this unlimited power always goes well, doesn't it? With a universally terrified populace? Just being realistic.</p>
<p>You gotta realize, though, that sometimes you need to pick your battles. You, as an individual, can only go so far. Like, there are some people out there that simply can't be convinced, who will always be Karens no matter how hard you try. Unfortunately, it's these people who tend to be in charge. I believe the public will have to revolt for things to change. The problem is, however, that no one is revolting. Too many people around me, young and old, have taken the fear porn hook, line, and sinker. Like I said, I don't know about your area, but the tide is not turning where I live. In fact, our governor just backpedaled. I hope it will be over someday but I have lost any and all hope. Giving up this power to our governments, pretending we have no rights as human beings, horrifies me to the core. I can't afford to move to South Dakota. I would like to revolt and all, but no one wants to join me. I don't know a lot of lockdown skeptics in real life, and the ones I do know are mild and draw the line at breaking the rules. Revolt is unlikely as long as the sheep remain terrified, but I don't see any other way out of it. Just being realistic.</p>
<p>I know how much you might not like hearing this, but this is <em>not</em> going to be over by the end of 2020. We'll probably be dealing with this well into 2021. <strong>Thanksgiving and Christmas will be cancelled.</strong> This isn't going to disappear right after the election; I mean, look at Europe. Even they're freaking out now. A lot of Americans on this sub probably wish they were in Europe right now. Sweden and the Netherlands? Maybe, but that's about it. I've seen "second wave" freakouts about the UK, Spain, France, and Germany so far. Will this stop one day? Of course it will, but it might be <em>much</em> later than you think. Don't want to give exact years. Just being realistic.</p>
<p>We just need to keep being realistic. I find this subreddit a good support and love -- love -- truly, emotionally care about, very much -- many of the people here who I have traveled with and read for months. However, we are only screwed if one defines the objective as "winning" or "losing" and also, where and how. My definition of "winning" is remaining reality-based. I would love the world to return to normal, but I'm not sure right now how that might happen because people are in a state of mass hallucination, and not understanding that does hurt us. I've also become more vocal with friends about the extreme pain this causes people, and I am waiting for unemployment and child care to run out and cause damages to see if more people don't shift their opinion then as well.</p>
<p>Will millions of people die? Probably not. Will governments be power-hungry for years? Unfortunately, the answer to that question is probably "yes". I'm not trying to whip up unwarranted fear, but I just want to give you all a reality check. My hope is all but gone; at this point, we might as well just call it quits. Lockdown skepticism is a lost cause. Subs like this one and r/LockdownSkepticism are already being censored on mobile. Once they are purged by the admins, it's all over.</p></p>

        <p>I agree it looks bad, but if I take on that level of reality, I will kill myself. I have had a very bad week--I can't sleep at night anymore, and when I do sleep I can't control how long it lasts. I cry for hours at a time and spend the rest of it just...sitting. I have been fighting with myself not to make suicide plans. Were it not for the idea of leaving my son alone to navigate this hellscape without his mother, I think I would have done it on Saturday night. I have to pull out of this for him, and I can't do that if I admit defeat. I have to look for good news. I have to believe that life will be worth living again.</p>
<p>I'm planning to leave Reddit soon, a place I almost exclusively visited to talk about jigsaw puzzles and send cards to kind strangers. All that seems a thousand years ago. These subs have been a lifeline, but I think I've said all I can say and read all I can read. I want to find some piece of my former joy for life. Fighting against this garbage and keeping ahead of the narrative has become the only thing in my life, and I don't think I'm strong enough to do this for more months.</p>

        <p>Honestly, since waking up today, I'm not sure I can cope at all any more. All I've done is cry. I haven't eaten in a couple of days and I have no interest in getting out of bed to fix that. My son is with his grandparents somewhere less restrictive, thank god, and my husband is out trying to keep his job alive. My closest friends don't talk to me anymore. This is never going to end.</p>

        <p>We want to be optimistic but I just see so much of history repeating. This shit is how the Nazis got into power and murdered the Jews. These people calling the police and bitching and making videos of non-masked people are those who'd call the SS on their neighbor for hiding Jews or being Jewish. It's terrifying.</p>

<p>It does make it a bit more complicated to have a kid in the mix. I feel like I've been throwing myself in front of a lot of things just to keep him happy and unaffected (as much as possible). But let's be honest, it's really not easy to be any kind of person right now. I hate that anyone at all has to feel like this at all. It feels so unfair.</p>
<p>Totally agree about in-person socializing. It would help so much to have a real group around all of us right now. Everyone is welcome to come set up a tent city on my land out here in KY, but our governor sucks and I only have the one bathroom. ;)</p>

        <p>I’m feeling the same. It’s because I’m so extroverted. I need interaction with people in real life. I don’t have the same kind of inner resources. Humans are social animals. I feel abandoned by my community. I do have some friends but I don’t want to overwhelm them. </p>
<p>I’ve spent whole days crying (one day at a time).  I usually bounce back. I’m trying not to wallow in negative emotions because that is self abuse. Distractions, no matter how silly, are better than letting yourself sit in such absolute pain. That being said I recently got extremely angry after an argument about the lockdown. I tried to use some personal growth tools to get centered but I did not want to stop being angry. I realized the anger was giving me energy and just covering up the utter despair. Plus, I got my kitchen clean.</p>

        <p>Let me just take issue with your declaration of Thanksgiving and Christmas being canceled. Memorial Day and 4th of July were supposed to be canceled, and yes a lot of people cowered in their basements for those holidays. But people were out shooting fireworks and going to their nearest body of water, virus be damned. Lake of the Ozarks, anyone?</p>
<p>You're going to always have a number of people that are afraid to be within 6 feet of other people, but the people who have had enough and are adult enough to make their own choices will have Thanksgiving and Christmas this year.</p>

        <p>July 4th out where I am was absolutely over the top. I have never seen so many people celebrating it, or shooting huge amounts of fireworks. It made me so happy. We immediately got hit with more restrictions after, which was no surprise. But it did seem like more than the usual suspects were going crazy with celebrations here.</p>

<p>The thing that frustrates me to hell is that people will "rebel" when it comes to shooting fireworks, or holding parties (even if some of them are masked or whatever). But when it comes to the larger issues of freedom, and protesting for our rights, people do not care, and even clamor for more restrictions. It's like, as long as they can have their stupid little bread and circus crap like July 4th fireworks and backyard BBQs, they are fine with the status quo of the "New Normal" like mandatory vaccines, masks, limit capacities, needing appointments/reservations to do anything recreational, and so on.</p>

        <p>I think willingness to go along with those rules boils down to one of 3 things. Either they're afraid of the virus, afraid of the consequences of bucking the rules, or they love the power that comes with enforcement or shaming.</p>

        <p>Can I just say, I believe it is literally a mix of all three for most of the pro-lockdown crowd, at least from my observation. Fear of dying of the virus is the overwhelming one, with the love of power and control being a close second.</p>

        <p>I saw people shake hands just yesterday in a parking lot outside Starbucks. I shook hands with the guy doing my Honda service last week. I shook hands with my massage therapist last week. People are still shaking hands.</p>
<p>There will be pockets of populations who continue to live this way. People in those populations who don’t want to be part of it will move and leave them to their terror.</p>
<p>There is not a single person I’ve spoken to that’s either not completely over it already or doesn’t expect it to be over with when a vaccine comes out. They were promised normalcy after a vaccine. That’s their hard line. We haven’t reached that yet so you aren’t seeing pushback because their promised line in the sand hasn’t been drawn yet.</p>
<p>I get the fear if you’re living somewhere that everyone is trippin but I live somewhere that hardly anyone is trippin and there’s no way at this point that they could go backwards. When our numbers were skyrocketing and the media said the sky was falling in my state, the governor didn’t back step. Our numbers are plummeting and it won’t backslide now. Not to mention I’m in the AC sunbelt area. In fall/winter/spring, everyone is outside or doesn’t run AC and leaves windows open. Our numbers won’t be high after summer at all and if northern states act like idiots, they’re going to see the populations move to where we are. It’s already happening.</p>
<p>There’s reasons to be vigilant. There’s no reason to be so completely negative when many places are nothing like you’ve described.</p>

        <p>My immediate family and most extended all agree this is bullshit and not ok. We are making plans with friends and neighbors on what to do in an emergency we are securing radios to establish a solid connection between our homes. We have been collecting food and storing it. One friend reloads ammo, we are pitching in on that to make as much as possible. My husband and I teach our boys all about our weapons and they know how to take them apart clean them and put them back together. I would rather be well prepared so it may sound crazy but it keeps us busy during this shit too. Honestly everyone should have a well laid out plan in case of any emergency even if this wasn’t going on. Oh and stick up on your toilet paper! Lol</p>

        <p>Yeah I agree.  I had so much hope the UK was returning to normal , then came local lockdowns, mask mandates and easing of their draconian rules.  I hate it but everyone just comply with the masks and follows it.  And with anti mask / lockdown protests like those in Germany being shot down as “ anti vaxx and right wing “ it’s hard to be hopeful</p>

        <p>Depending on the day of the week I either feel hopeful or hopeless. However, I can’t totally give up. I just feel (hope) that we will get to a breaking point and a number of people will say enough is enough.
I don’t know how this will end but I believe it will. Humans aren’t meant to live like this. We are a social species and the longer this drags out the more people will rebel.</p>
