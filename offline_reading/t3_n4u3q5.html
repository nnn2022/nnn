    <strong>What the hell is going on here?</strong>
    <p><p>I joined this sub because - like many Americans - I have absolutely no interest in a “new normal”. However, I haven’t ever seen a post that has to do anything with what the description is about and certainly not “nonpartisan” as it claims. This just seems to be an anti-mask and anti-vax sub without any regard for smart or informed thoughts. I am fully vaccinated so I don’t bother to wear a mask unless I’m in a store that specifically says I have to wear one. I don’t want a new normal. But that doesn’t really seem to be what this sub is about I’m just confused I suppose.</p></p>

        <p>The sub is basically people who don't need to have their hand held and told what to do. It also has people like me who are furious with others being suspended from their jobs or canceled out entirely for simply giving their side on how they think the mask pushing is ridiculous bullshit.  </p>
<p>Just today a nurse in my state of NJ was suspended because she posted a video claiming that kids wearing masks all day at school is abuse and wrong. So now we even stab our own school nurses in the back for looking out for our kids. It's this kind of shit, along with countless other incidents that fuel a sub like this.</p>

        <p>Certainly is plenty of hypocrisy to point out and over-the-top requests from the folks in charge that are supposed to be following “the science”. The science does show that young people without pre-existing conditions are really really unlikely to have more than basically a mild flu/mono sort of deal. I don’t have a problem with pushing back against unrealistic requests for masks and social distancing but I just think doing it under the guise of a “no new normal” sub (presumably to not get banned) is a bit off.</p>

        <p>There are many posts about the entire 'new normal' plan.   They just get drowned out by the new normal advocates who come here to troll. </p>
<p>Do you not see how the masks and fake-vaccines fit into the whole scheme though?   </p>
<p>The viral scare lead to the lockdowns.  Lockdowns created a more centralized and virtual economy by destroying small businesses.</p>
<p>Masks are to keep everyone in a state of fear.</p>
<p>The mRNA injections touted as 'vaccines' are there to divide people into camps, and then lead to the demand for 'vaccine passports' so the vaccinated can 'stay safe'.   </p>
<p>The passports are just a lead in to the digital identification and tracking system that will eventually become the social credit system.    </p>
<p>The next shock of financial/currency crisis will lead to UBI tied to your social credit and identification system.  </p>
<p>It's a path.   Leading us all in the direction of Agenda 2030.</p>
<p>That's what this sub is about and there many posts about this overall goal of the corporations of governments to engage us in The Great Reset.</p>

        <p>I certainly understand the cause for worry but I’m not sure how any of this is signaling some sort of Reckoning. Yes the vaccine passports are Orwellian and creepy. Yes I believe the big pharma companies don’t care about health. However, I’m really not sure how simple and recommended health mandates have to do with fear and population control. The media are the ones fear mongering. Yes I see how groundwork has been (most likely accidentally) laid for some sort of upset to happen but I don’t think there are ulterior motives to simple requests like “please wear a mask in my store/town”.</p>
<p>But if I can be real, as a vaccinated person and a healthy 19 year old, fuck masks.</p>

        <p>&rt; I am fully vaccinated so I don’t bother to wear a mask unless I’m in a store that specifically says I have to wear one.</p>
<p>Do you see a problem with a store requiring you to wear a mask even if you're vaccinated and supposedly protected against covid?</p>
<p>The majority of us do see a problem and it's why this sub was created. We discuss rules and restrictions that are a result of the "new normal".</p>
<p>I think you seem to conflate anti-masker with what we really are and that is that we are against not having the freedom to choose. If someone is wearing a mask because they feel it's the best decision for their health and safety, I would never insult, denigrate or make fun of someone who was doing it out of their own free will. People who wear a mask alone in their car and think they are being helpful, it's sad that they are so misinformed and at the same time, they are making a fool of themselves so the deserve any snarky comments that come their way.</p>
<p>As far as anti-vax, I am just going to speak for me personally but am sure most will agree...we are not anti-vax. I for one am against being forced to take an experimental gene therapy. I am against liability exemptions for big pharma companies that make billions knowing people are going to die and have severe lifelong conditions as a result of taking vaccines or gene therapy shots and families who have children affected by this are left with the vaccine injury courts which have a cap of, well I don't know the exact number but pretty sure it's something like $250K give or take and it's all tax payer funded...that's right, the people are funding their own lawsuit payouts, the vaccine manufacturers are completely unaccountable.</p>
<p>It makes me sad that you got downvoted as I don't think you have any malicious intentions. You're not a troll or anything, you just have a different perspective. I haven't been on this sub for very long but I'd like to think we welcome points of view that we disagree with as long as you're coming here in good faith.</p>

        <p>Listen man I get that it’s annoying but usually they just kick you out if you don’t wear one and my McNuggets are more important sometimes than reclaiming my freedom:/</p>

        <p>I get it. I'd be a hypocrite if I didn't admit that I wear a mask when I go places too. They are really strict where I live so it's either wear a mask or don't eat. At some point they are going to push the majority of people past their line of what they consider acceptable and I hope by then it's not too late to do something about it. I just wish people would have fought back against this shit sooner instead of just going along with it because one little freedom lost isn't so bad.</p>
