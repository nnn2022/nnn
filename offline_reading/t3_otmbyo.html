        <p>I hate all of it. Dancing around questions and playing fast and loose with definitions, and tailoring every response to absolutely fit whatever the prep team came up with. Literally every one of these I’ve ever seen, be it from Fauci or anyone else, covid related or not, is just pointless jabber. They need a big dude in the back yelling “answer the question!” Why ask if we can’t force an answer that directly responds to the question? Why allow the standard lawyer/politician response of answering the question you wanted them to ask rather than the one they were asked?</p>

        <p>Could we not just send a couple of thousand volts through a particularly sensitive body part when they don’t answer a question or give those really roundabout ways of explaining things which ends up with you giving the Billy Madison speech about god having mercy on their soul?</p>
<p>I don’t care if they’re lying or tell telling the truth an answer is an answer and you can tell a whole lot about people by the way they answer difficult questions, but dodging the question and giving non-answers is fucking infuriating while they run down the clock so they can get away with their hides intact!</p>
<p>Like a Football player taking a dive during extra time and rolling around on the floor wailing, then as soon as the whistle goes they jump up and saunter off like they’re a fucking hero...</p>
