    <strong>What does it mean to Health Care Workers to work with "infectious" patients</strong>
    <p><p>Interestingly in April 2020 the European Resuscitation Council gave a statement about COVID-19 in cardiopulmaonal resuscitation which gave a very broad focus on PPEs (personal protection equipment). The whole work is against one principle in medicine. "Primum nihil nocere" - which means "do not harm."</p>
<p>This statement was one of the things many doctors and nurses followed in fear (me included). Because of the legal consequences of this paradigm shift most of my collegues keep on this "rules" even they got vaccinated. In my opinion they are not just crazy but...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>OK. To explain a little. The fundament of the overuse of personal protecting equipment is this sentence:  "We suggest that chest compressions and cardiopulmonary resuscitation have the potential to generate aerosols (weak recommendation, very low certainty evidence)."</p>
<p>This VERY LOW evidence lead also to this video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcBbYskmT-A&amp;t=156s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcBbYskmT-A&amp;t=156s</a>). I Think it is obvious that the recommandation in this video is too stop any possible air coming into the patients lung, which means the chance too survive without neurological damage is as low as the evidence for this recommandation.</p>
<p>In the referred paper from Deakin et al they write " The effectiveness of passive ventilation [...] remains to be investigated." </p>
<p>- But this weak assumption of passive ventilation is the argument for not giving breath assist during CPR because it can eventually lead to oxigenation of the brain and minimise brain damage.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Most of the references are either chinese papers from the Wuhan-Outbreak or papers from SARS in Canada.</p>
<p>Very interesting is this paper (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5733382/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5733382/</a>).</p>
<p>The authors postulate that  "CPR is an aerosol-generating procedure ". They describe how Patient C, the infected health care worker, got infected and finally confessed:  “I know that I was infected by MERS within body fluids of the patient when I unconsciously wiped off my sweat,” and also explained the situation of exposure during CPR, “Since the goggle was heavy, I thought it slid down together with the mask.” </p>
<p>OK the authors explain how much infectious fluids were in the room, they describe how long it took for Patient C to get the room clean after 1 hour of CPR, they explain the necessity of PPEs and quarantine and so on.</p>
<p>No word about if other people involved in this CPR got tested, no word on the doctors performing CPR, intubation, suctioning ect.  No word on the  closed-circuit television which showed in detail how Patient C " touched the mask and goggle with her hands in contaminated gloves " but was not available to the authors.</p>
<p>Hey come on. In western world this is not science. This is scapegoating. </p>
<p>Not only weak evidence but true meanness is what this science is based on. Tell them people still wearing this heavy war equipment about this.</p>
<p>Thanks</p></p>

        <p>All the actual scenario was built over weak evidences and no transparency with a strong propaganda machine.</p>

        <p>As I said. Not only weak evidence. It is the "Weltbild" meaning the ideas how the world should be which frightens me.
The medicine changed in 2020 from caring and helping people to somewhat crazy. 
Locking sick people in hospitals, depriving them from their families and care givers and only confront them with people i  masks and plastic suits.
This killed more than saved. Also these with COVID-Pneumonia.</p>
