    <strong>Friendly reminder: If you go "voting", you actively give permission to be ruled by whatever politician will be declared as your new master for the next 4 years.</strong>
    <p><p>That's what "voting" really is, trying to choose who should enslave you for 4 years - you and everyone else as well.</p>
<p>If that politician or the system he rules over mandates you to wear muzzles or forces you to get injected or decides whatever amount of money to take from you under the thread of caging you if you don't comply - you then declared to be okay with it.</p>
<p>All "problems of 2020" have this as the source - that tyrants forced us into an even way worse position than before.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You declared through participating in voting to be in line with whatever they come up with for the next 4 years, that you don't even know of. This is giving a blank check to corrupt control freaks who walk over dead bodies.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Even worse you now became an offender too, as you demanded that everyone else should be subjected to being ruled over by whatever politician you fell for as well.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Don't go "voting" if you don't want to be enslaved and don't want to enslave others.</p></p>

<p>That's just off the top of my head. The dude has made me question my political views, where I was once black pulled like yourself. That it's all a lie. The genuine hatred for trump from hollywood and the MSM makes me feel like he wasn't actually part of the plan.</p>

        <p>&rt;I could go on all day about the positive things Trump has accomplished.</p>
<p>What does that have to do with the fact that enslaving others is wrong? "Voting" tries to accomplish exactly that, interdependently which one of the pre-selected puppets of the ruling class you fell for. </p>
<p>What you say comes close to "I could go on all day about all the positive things slavery has accomplished". Even if you could come up with positive things, does that make slavery now legitimate?</p>
<p>Apart from that, "positive things" compared to what? An even more terrible tyrant? Your frame of reference is wrong.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;The genuine hatred for trump from hollywood and the MSM makes me feel like he wasn't actually part of the plan.</p>
<p>Of course it was part of the script. They presented one of their pre-selected puppets as "anti-establishment" to prey on the crave for actual change of all the miserable people fed up with the system. </p>
<p>To make that even more obvious (and ridiculous) they made the biden dude seem like an demented creep - it's all an act for the camera.</p>
<p>They are in the same team, right and left wing belong to the same vulture. That's btw also the reason that clinton is not "in jail" as claimed by that trump dude, that was yet another simple lie so naive people cheer for the dictator, thinking they prevented an even worse dictator from happening, when no dictator would be possible is people wouldn't fucking cheer for their own enslavement.</p>
<p>You still completely fell for it if you think the apparently less horrible megalomaniac presented to you were your friend. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But nothing, absolutely nothing you wrote is even a single counterargument to anything I wrote. All you try to say is - <em>"...and that's why we need to declare ourselves slaves to the ruling class"</em>. <strong>No - ffs.</strong></p>

        <p>&rt;I am not a slave. The correlation you are making is ridiculous and makes zero sense.</p>
<p>You telling a politician that you want to be ruled by them literally and absolutely enslaves you. You crave to be their slave and them being your master bossing you around.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;You are actually accepting your fate as a slave, with no choice in the future of your nation.</p>
<p>Stop identifying with the plantation, it's pathetic. I don't accept to be enslaved, that's why I don't put some politician scum in power, like you apparently deliberately did. </p>
<p>I'm as much a victim of enslavement as you are - physically, but the difference between us is that you demand it to continue - and for everyone not just yourself, while I recognized that begging to be ruled over doesn't make you free, but the contrary and an accomplice of immense evil if you want others to be enslaved as well. </p>
<p>A slave thinking their own enslavement needs to continue is the most thoroughly enslaved peasant imaginable. They must be proud of what their propaganda achieved if some enslaved ones like you demand it to continue. I wonder how they even can get to sleep while constantly having to laugh so hard.</p>

        <p>Because they get you to participate in the evil yourself, you now become a accomplice.</p>
<p>The people in nazi-germany voting for hitler and being full of hope after the disaster of ww1 thought that would be the lesser evil as well, as did the people who voted for stalin, mao or any other fascist dictator in history. Aren't the people putting them in power responsible as well?</p>

<p>If you are stuck into thinking your only options to change anything were deciding which pre-selected puppet of the ruling class should boss you around, you are quite literally a slave demanding for shackles. What can I further say to you, if enslaving yourself and everybody else is a valid option for you?</p>
<p>You fall for their very scheme that solely exist to prevent real change to happen:</p>
<p>Giving you an illusion you had any say in the matter of the terms of your own enslavement is apparently all that is needed for people to cheer for tyrants. After all the countless atrocities that happened already, including this whole scamdemic, and you still want to be ruled over. If you crave enslavement, than be a slave, but don't subjugate others to the same.</p>
<p>"Voting" makes you an aggressor and accomplice of slavery and evil. But the ridiculous thing is, you don't even profit from it, not even slightly, quite the contrary.</p>

        <p>Ok, I'm sorry.  Then why would it matter to you whether anyone votes or not?  Either way they would still have to follow the laws and mandates of the winner.

        <p>&rt;I can understand making this decision for yourself, but not your last sentence that specifically tells people not to vote if they don't want to be enslaved.</p>
<p>That's precisely the problem with "voting" you demand to be ruled over by the politician that seems slightly less terrible, and demand it for everyone else as well. You don't make the decision only for yourself but want everyone else enslaved by that tyrant as well. That's why I care.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Edit: After reading your newer comments I think I understand your  position better.  You want to change the structure of the government so  there is no president and no elected leaders in charge, correct?  Out of  curiosity, do you support any specific form of government, or do you  prefer no government at all?</p>
<p>First - you are the first and so far only one who actually wasn't trying to shoot the messenger, and even sought to understand my point - I very much respect that. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"Government" as a consistent  concept doesn't actually exist, because you have no right to rule over someone else - nobody has (the only "exceptions" are severe and dangerous criminals who really need to be locked away, but that's simply a form of defense against aggressors). </p>
<p>But that's all "government" essentially is - a group of people pretending to have the right to boss everyone else around.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You don't have the right to tell someone <em>that you want to take as much money from them as you see fit and will send armed thugs to put them in a cage if they dare to resist your robbery and even murder them if they resist the kidnapping as well</em>. Though that's what politicians do, so how did the politicians get that "right"? (Further you can't give someone a right that you yourself don't have, as much as you can't give someone a car that you don't own.) </p>
<p>Because some other politicians wrote on a piece of paper 200 years ago that robbery is fine if it's called "taxation"? I can write criminal nonsense on a piece of paper too, but that doesn't change reality or morality. Robbery is still robbery, even if it's called something else to hide that fact. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Though I would need to write much more, as we all have been subjected to nearly 2 decades of "government"-indoctrination, which takes time to take apart.</p>
<p>But somebody else did it already in an extremely effective way and that's why I suggest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngpsJKQR_ZE">this</a> short video as a starting point, and then go through his others videos if you like - the most viewed ones are quite spectacular.</p>

        <p>Of course we are not reading from the same script.  It's called disagreement and debate.  It happens in free countries.</p>
<p>It's only victim blaming if you consider the citizens of a free country to be victims of their government.  But voting is not really a right or a privilege, it's a duty.   A government derives its just powers from the consent of the governed. </p>
<p>If you vote and you don't get the results you want, you are not a victim, that's representative democracy.  If you don't vote and don't get the results you want you are not a victim you are simply foolish.</p>
