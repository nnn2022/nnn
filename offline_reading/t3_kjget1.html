    <strong>Extreme prediction from a professed medical worker. For any Nurses, Doctors, Researchers, any medical and/or hospital workers, or anyone who knows someone in these fields, where do you think this extremism is coming from?</strong>
    <p><p>The prediction and analysis is here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/kglq8o/covid_in_americawhats_the_realistic_forecast/ggkvlic/?context=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/kglq8o/covid_in_americawhats_the_realistic_forecast/ggkvlic/?context=3</a></p>

<p>The claim is that doctors, medical researchers, nurses, lab techs and others, who feel we have to contend with this for at least 2 more years, are motivated solely by facts and want to go back to 2019 openness but rationally feel they can't.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There's now claims that we have to be at least as restrictive as Australia or Vietnam and that if we were as strict as they were, that America would've gotten past this.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Does this stem from lack of realization of what's going on in Australia, Asian nations and similar places?  Or a subconscious desire for Western nations to be as restrictive?</p></p>

        <p>For this thing to go on killing large numbers for two years, it would be unlike any pandemic in modern history. Including the Spanish flu. Not to mention that even this (largely manufactured) second wave already appears to be peaking.  </p>
<p>I'm sorry but it just looks like incompetence to me. Doctors and nurses who are capable of following procedures but not much else. Doctors and nurses who have far too narrow of a focus on specific diseases with too little concern for overall health (motivated in part by a subconscious desire to increase the perceived status and importance afforded by their careers it seems to me).</p>

        <p>I work in a hospital.  People get sick.  People die from illness.  It happens all the time.  I have not seen anything that would indicate this.  It's business as usual here.  If it wasn't for the media and the policy changes and the governments, there wouldn't be any indication that anything was any different than the last several years.</p>

<p>Like .. i don't understand how this is flying at the hospitals. There must be tons of people who are weirded out by the mismatch between the media and actual conditions.</p>
<p>Does everyone just assume it must be really bad everywhere else?</p>
