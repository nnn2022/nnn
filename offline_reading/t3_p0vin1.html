    <strong>“It only works if everyone does it”</strong>
    <p><p>That’s called a CRAPPY VACCINE. </p>
<p>Normal vaccines are supposed to protect YOU. To PREVENT YOU from getting sick, period. They don’t depend on who around you has or has not received the shot. </p>
<p>It blows my mind that people are so stupid that they don’t even question why a vaccine suddenly works only in large numbers when that’s never been the case before. </p>
<p>If you’re vaccinated against anything and are still told to worry about other people infecting you, the vaccine is trash and people need to run in the opposite direction. It’s NOT HARD TO GRASP.</p></p>

        <p>No kidding, not to mention the fact that there’s been talk of booster shots every 6 months… wtf?</p>
<p>Last time I had blood drawn I had my titer levels checked for the hepatitis B vaccine I had when I was 10 or 11. </p>
<p>This was after covid vaccines started getting rolled out and I was hearing about how they don’t provide lasting immunity which seemed really weird to me because most vaccines you get as a kid you only need once. So I was curious. And good news! Apparently I still have immunity over 20 years later.</p>
<p>I just don’t understand how people are willing to accept these boosters. Clearly the vaccine doesn’t even work.</p>

        <p>The clot shot really is a fucking joke. And I see a lot of buyers remorse already. I guarantee that they will ramp up pressure via propaganda to make the plebs feel better about their decision </p>
<p>The only vaccine that I know of that needs a booster is for tetanus. And that’s <strong>Every 10 years……</strong></p>

        <p>I think chicken pox needs a booster occasionally (ten or fifteen years) but I could be misremembering.</p>
<p>The idea of immunity lasting a mere months is a joke. Our bodies aren't idiots, ffs. We have immune systems, they've kept our species alive for a little while now.</p>

        <p>I’ve taken the chicken pox vax at age 19, ‘cause I never had chicken pox as a kid. my grandma almost died to adult chicken pox. From what I understand it’s people like me who haven’t had chicken pox as a kid, who take it. But it was not pressured on me by anyone, I myself chose, unlike what’s happening now in the world</p>

        <p>Yeah... I wasn’t well informed on vaccine effects when I took it at 19. I just was worried of adult chickenpox. I don’t know was it a good choice or not, but I’ve been fine. At least it is a normally tested vaccine and not an experimental gene therapy. </p>
<p>I’m 32 now and don’t plan on taking any vaccines ever anymore however, with what I’ve learnt later on in life and with my easily effected health.</p>

        <p>Same, last one I took was a meningitis one.  Decided after that I'm not having anymore because i don't like needles and was getting to an age where I could decide something like that myself.   Nothing to do with being anti-vax or anything... but now, this whole thing has put me off vaccines forever.</p>

        <p>Honestly I believe that was a freak occurrence. Out of my almost 30 years on this planet that’s the only time I’ve seen chickenpox in the US. </p>
<p>I did live in Central America for a while as my parents were working for the US foreign service(embassy) at the time. It’s much more common outside of the US from my observation. At the time I was there vaccines were still super expensive so still had “pox parties” to intentionally get their kids sick so they have natural immunity.</p>

        <p>As far as I know, almost every kid in the US gets the chicken pox vaccine before they start school, not because we're concerned about chicken pox, but because "adult" chicken pox and shingles caused by a flare up of the chicken pox virus can be very nasty. If you get the chicken pox vaccine as a kid, you never have to worry about that.</p>

        <p>&rt; The only vaccine that I know of that needs a booster is for tetanus. And that’s Every 10 years……</p>
<p>There’s actually a lot of evidence this is unnecessary for Tetanus as well. I remember reading a study, ironically pretty sure it was WHO funded as the objective was to find out if impoverished countries needed boosters for tetanus or if one shot would do. IIRC they showed the tetanus vaccine still had high efficacy 20+ years after the initial shot and the authors suggested for many the shot may offer lifelong protection.</p>

        <p>Interesting. Will I got by first booster last year being almost 30. Honestly if I have to take a poke <strong>once a decade</strong> for something that’s actually dangerous to me (I work on old cars a lot) then that I’m ok with. </p>
<p>I’m not signing up for the spike protein lifetime membership where I’ll have to take “booster” every 6-12 months(for now, they could change this to every other week as far as the covidians know) out of my own pocket.</p>

        <p>For rabies I’m pretty sure there’s two different types of shots. One is the equivalent of an actual vaccine, the other is active antibodies or similar and is the booster. They give you the latter shot as a booster just to kickstart your immune system to make damn sure the virus doesn’t take hold.</p>
<p>It’s also probably partially a thing with rabies as extra security, because you absolutely don’t want rabies. It’s essentially 100% mortality once you become symptomatic.</p>

        <p>I'd like to point out it is not 100% mortality, up to 16% of people have survived rabies post symptoms with no medical intervention. If we could find out why that is, that'd be greeeat</p>

        <p>I’m not sure where you got that number, I know a handful have survived but even then from my understanding that’s usually only in 1st world countries with top notch care and involves putting the patient into an induced coma. </p>
<p>Regardless even if 16% survive that’s pretty fucking bad, I’ll take a shot to prevent that if I’m bit for sure.</p>

        <p>I'd have to look it up, but that number stood out to me because I've always thought rabies was 100% mortality too, and also that 16% didn't need medical intervention whatsoever, so I'm sure the actual mortality rate with medicine is even lower.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm taking a look around and I'm seeing a lot about the Milwaukee protocol and some animal studies that show the 15%, but haven't found the human stat yet. Some human studies show the antibody is present without treatment. My digital library is not very well organized so I'm left to search it. I believe it had something to do with how it was recorded, if I recall. There were a number of issues overall including patients who are diagnosed and given the shot but not actually testing positive, lots of soft science practices and numbers around rabies.</p>

        <p>&rt; not to mention the fact that there’s been talk of booster shots every 6 months… wtf?</p>
<p>Of all the conspiracies that are seemingly likely these days with how crazy the world has become, I’m still a big believer that this is primarily about money. I personally don’t think the vaccine manufacturers are intentionally putting out a harmful product, or that the government is intentionally using it for population control or any complicated, grand evil scheme. I think big pharma wants to make big bucks, and frankly doesn’t care if there’s side effects or not, and a handful of paid for politicians are enabling them with the rest of the officials that aren’t bought either going along simply because they’re mindless sheep or they have their own political agenda that happens to align with this insanity. </p>
<p>Boosters and the push for them makes this more obvious. Big pharma wants a shot in every arm in the world once every 6 months, there’s insane amounts of money to be made if that’s mandated or even just promoted.</p>

        <p>But what could make the pharma industry more money than an endless supply of sick patients? If you agree they are after money you should just take it a step further and assume the worst. Pfizer was sued in 2009 for $2.3billion for fraud and bribery, J&amp;J are still settling their $3b asbestos-in-baby-powder case. Some might consider that the cost of business when your profits are into the hundreds of billions annually.</p>

        <p>I'm going to call a spade a spade here.... This is ALWAYS how vaccines worked. No vaccine is 100% effective. Most are 90%+ effective. And the way they work is that they rely on enough people getting them to create herd immunity. That's why about a decade ago we were seeing an outbreak of whooping cough in California (I believe it was California). While most that were effected were the unvaccinated there were some children effected who were vaccinated but contracted it anyway.</p>
<p>The big problem with the covid vaccine is that it is very leaky (a lot of people are still contracting and spreading the disease despite vaccination). These types of vaccines are prone to creating variants that make the disease more resilient and often more deadly, which is kinda what we've been seeing since the vaccinations have started. There was a 2015 study done regarding leaky vaccines; pre-pandemic study so no bone being picked there. Just solid science.</p>

        <p>Well…thats not good. </p>
<p>It also aligns with the game theory of the NWO wanting to kill off the non-docile, skeptical rebels for the culling. </p>
<p>What it doesn’t align with is the fact that a virulent strain at a magnitude of order of ten times alpha is still only 2% of the world dead and not the 20% or 30% that would be worth the risk. I guess the lethality could get there given significant compounding exponentially over time but the longer it takes, the more risk of rebellion and lockdown burnout. </p>
<p>Also chicken’s immune systems function differently than humans so there’s that. </p>
<p>None the less, this is good data so thank you.</p>

        <p>It’s because the vaccine is 95% effective. So there’s still a 5% chance you may get the disease. But if everyone gets the vaccine the chance to get the disease is vastly diminished. </p>
<p>It’s not that hard to understand really</p>

        <p>It's 100% you get the disease, numbnuts. It doesn't prevent anything, just lessens symptoms. And doesn't prevent spread. Therefore it's not a vaccine.</p>
<p>I swear, the dumbest people are pro-coviders.</p>
