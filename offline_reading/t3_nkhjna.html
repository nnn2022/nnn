    <strong>Anti-COVID-19 megathread</strong>
    <p><p>Hello, 
I’ve had this idea floating around for awhile and I’d like to use the power of reddit to do something. I believe we need a thread to cover a very wide range of topics relating to covid-19 to disprove all the Karen’s. This would basically be an archive of scientific data and examples of the cdc, UN, world governments and others in power contradicting themselves on issues regarding COVID-19, from shutdowns, to masks, to vaccines, economic/psychological effects, effects on child development, and everything in between. This could be used as a quick source for those looking to disprove covid Karen’s without having to search for answers.</p>
<p>Please post any and all links pertaining to this. Please make sure news sources are cited and have accurate information, no conspiracy theories. I have a bone to pick with many people now that this is all winding down, and I’ve for the most part kept my mouth shut to people irl. </p>
<p>This thread is NOT for posting things like “my body my choice goes both ways” or “well they’re giving out Hamburgers for jabs and those are unhealthy”.....while these are accurate statements, they do nothing but make you a contrarian and do not actually give any data. They’re just headlines and memes.</p>
<p>Thank you</p></p>

        <p>Nice idea, though the phrase ‘you can lead the horse to water but you can’t force it to drink’ comes to mind.</p>
