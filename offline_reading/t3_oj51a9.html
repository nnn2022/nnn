    <strong>Does anyone know what is really going on in Columbia?</strong>
    <p><p>If you run a search on "Columbia protests" it returns a fair amount of mainstream media articles with titles such as "Columbia's protests explained - CNN," "Why are Colombians Protesting? -NBC," and "What's behind the Columbia protests? -ABC"  </p>
<p>The reader of these articles soon learns that Colombians were initially upset over a recent proposed tax increase, and further outraged over police brutality. Several news sources also claim that protestors are upset over vaccine shortages- something I personally doubt. </p>
<p>Does anyone here have friends or family in Colombia that know what is really going on?  I heard about COVID related protests many months ago, much earlier than the recent events.</p></p>

        <p>The media for some reason keeps adding that they can't get vaccines, as the reason.</p>
<p>Shits nuts all over right now. Colombia, Cuba, Africa. I'm sure there are others. And I doubt any of them have to do vaccine availability. My guess is just unrest hitting a boiling point. Typical shit they deal with, corruption, plus the current environment.</p>

        <p>The lockdowns have frayed the rich world, but we're not starving yet.</p>
<p>Countries that were already struggling are seeing starvation and falling apart.  This is part of the plan. Collapse the third world and then flood the US and Europe with refugees.  Then usher in one world government.</p>
