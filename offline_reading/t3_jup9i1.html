    <strong>Can we please stop the doomer shit?</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve been seeing way too much low energy doomer shit lately.</p>
<p>That’s not who we’re supposed to be. We are supposed to be the people that do not believe COVID-19 is the end of civilization. I understand, there is plenty to be worried about at the moment, but don’t admit defeat, because we haven’t lost. I didn’t wear a mask to the gym yesterday, and Mike DeWine did not bust down the door to the gym and put one on me. Not only did he not do it himself, no men with guns did it for him. He can go on TV and demand whatever he wants from me, it’s all in his head. It’s still my choice to listen. That means we’re still winning because we still choose if we want to listen to these morons. Their power is fictional. It exists because we decided it exists. Shit might continue to be fucked up for a long time after this, but we cannot sit around being upset over how bad things are. That is exactly what the useful idiots begging for more lockdowns do. The difference is, when they beg for what they want the government is happy to oblige, and when we beg for what we want the government says “tough shit”.</p>
<p>We’re not going to get what we want by being doomers. We’re going to get what we want by being strong, capable humans. This is what the world needs right now. You quite literally have a chance to be a superhero. Enough with the doom and gloom. High energy only from here on out.</p>
<p>The victors write the history books. Do you want the next generation learning about the evil lock down skeptics, or do you want them learning about the tyrannical government that used a pandemic as an opportunity to seize power and silence dissenters? The choice is ours.</p>
<p>There’s 13,000 subscribers on this sub and another 24,000 on r/lockdownskepticism (probably a fair bit of overlap so let’s say there’s ~20k of us). Holy shit, do you have any idea what we could do with 20,000 strong, knowledgeable, good looking, optimistic people backing our cause? That’s a literal fucking army. We could do absolutely anything we wanted to if we all collectively got our minds and bodies right.</p>
<p>I highly recommend if you feel you don’t fit that description, put in the work and fix it. We are going to need all the help we can get.</p></p>

        <p>73 million people in the US voted against lockdowns. 73 million people do not want the Great Reset.</p>
<p>There are currently more veterans in the US than active members, and I don’t think they will like being told that they fought for nothing.</p>
<p>Most law enforcement groups support Trump, and not a single one supported Biden. They’re not going to support the side that wants to defund them, and that tried to pick them off. Aside from a few sadistic officers, I think there’s a good chance they may defect.</p>
<p>I think the new world order will be met with A LOT of resistance.</p>

        <p>Bud, we're losing and bad. now wants to really fight I blame the internet but it seems more and more everyday that we are screwed. to many people including me will wear the mask because "I need to get this real quick" any conversations that we have over reddit are probably being infiltrated and people will feel like they did enough we need a physical meeting place were we can do things together. instead of protesting in the streets maybe we could all go to the same store at once and not wear a mask.

        <p>Imagine thinking that sending a mob, some likely armed, into a privately owned business, to take it over, with a list of demands is somehow not domestic terrorism and is somehow a “patriotic” act.</p>

        <p>It’s more so as to have a legitimate focus point to get the apathetic actually involved and paying attention so that they can’t just dismiss you, that way you get public traction. If the <em>big show</em> is presenting itself as legitimate and using courts, legal systems, and public figures as its tools then to some extent it has to play by its own rules - when it stops bothering humanity must then entertain alternative options. If it’s inescapable then delay might be a nice option for the peasantry to have.</p>

        <p>I agree. This too shall pass.</p>
<p>I think it's a trap to get too caught up in all the bullshit going on at the moment and miss the big picture. Things seem permanent in the present but change (and revolutions) happen fast. Consider how different the world was in 1920.</p>

        <p>Are you that dumb that you believe that a throwaway comment on Reddit is a legitimate attempt to invade a country?</p>
<p>Do you think I would seriously recommend that regular citizens who have never met each other go invade a random country for no other reason then just to flex their numbers? Do you think anyone is that retarded?</p>
<p>I made a comment about the armies to compare the size of the sub Reddit to other nations. My entire point was we can do a lot with the people we have on our side, If Belgium can maintain an entire fucking country with numbers similar to ours, I’m sure we could create change in our respective governments. There is not one point where I ever recommended anyone go invade any country lmao.</p>
<p>Reddit does have a history of banning subs for violence, but I made no threat of violence and certainly no credible threat of violence. If you read what I said as a legitimate call to arms, great, have fun getting blown to bits by the NZ armed forces.</p>

        <p>Great, you explain your reasoning to the people in charge of Reddit after the sub gets banned. I'm sure your passionate defense of the comment will reverse the ban.</p>

        <p>I'm especially sick of the UK posters on here. They all seem so incredibly downtrodden and defeatist. Like look, I really don't give a shit about what Lord Tiddlywinks said, either get out there and protest or shut up. I have no use in listening to others bemoan their situation when they dont even have the courage to go buy their Kumpets and Tesco without a mask on.</p>

        <p>Yes and a popular place, a free way to reach a global audience.  We need a marketing plan! Make it something people understand.</p>
<p>OP said “20,000 strong, knowledgeable, good looking, optimistic people.” </p>
<p>What if we really marketed this? </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Get the most striking amongst us to be our spokesmodels and influencers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get the most witty and articulate to write their scripts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get the best researchers to give them the data and information from which to write, and so on.</p>

        <p>The truth will out. Don't know how long that'll take in the end but we'll have the last laugh. Everyone knows most of what we're saying here is true, because it's so fucking obvious, but our culture has become so obsessed with gestures, platitudes and not speaking your mind for fear of offending anyone that it's become taboo to say anything. But as long as there's one of us, that's a victory in itself. Doom and gloom isn't helping, and I think we're all a bit guilty of it here. Thanks OP.</p>
