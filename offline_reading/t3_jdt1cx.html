        <p>Lots of us here are envious about the freedoms enjoyed in Sweden while in  many parts of the world our basic freedoms are being taken away from us -  like breathing!  Well, showing people that Sweden is an example to  follow will only go so far. Emotions are stronger than logic quite  often, especially now. Lust for power and fear are very strong in the  “leaders” and the unquestioning / submissive followers.</p>
<p>So…how  did Sweden arrive at its COVID strategy?  Apart from Tegnell's  suggestions, etc...   Well..it relates to a way of thought that is  strong in Sweden and other Scandinavian countries (Who have not mandated  masks - or only in select situations - public transit in Denmark for  example).</p>
<p>And this is a way of thought that if you take to heart and project on EVERYONE around you, can perhaps turn the tide.</p>
<p>This  way of thought is called Jantelagen. In English, Jante Law. It  originates / was codified from Denmark but has widespread acceptance in  Norway, Sweden, and to a lesser degree in Finland, and even lesser in  Iceland – but the way of thinking certainly persists in the latter two.</p>
<p>So here is Jante Law in full.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>You're not to think you are anything special.</strong></li>
<li>You're not to think you are as good as we are.</li>
<li><strong>You're not to think you are smarter than we are.</strong></li>
<li>You're not to imagine yourself better than we are.</li>
<li>You're not to think you know more than we do.</li>
<li><strong>You're not to think you are more important than we are.</strong></li>
<li>You're not to think you are good at anything.</li>
<li>You're not to laugh at us.</li>
<li><strong>You're not to think anyone cares about you.</strong></li>
<li><strong>You're not to think you can teach us anything.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>What  this does  is it lowers the EGO / POWER TRIPPING MIND of yourself and  others around you. It brings us to being more equal on an <strong>emotional &amp; thought</strong>  level. In other words, Scandinavian leaders are less inclined to  implement draconian laws / regulations because they don’t want to  “impose their way on you.”  Especially relevant with masks.</p>
<p>I’ve  highlighted the 5 most important ones. You can drop the other 5 if you  like – I’ve found they aren’t as helpful / not healthy.</p>
<p><strong>So…here’s what you need to do:</strong></p>
<p>You  need to keep repeating these OUT LOUD until you accept them without  question. They defend your sense of self and prevents others from taking  advantage of you.</p>
<p>You need to be able to <strong>SAY THEM OUT LOUD</strong>.  You must project them on EVERYONE you know - even parents/spouse/kids.   Think of anyone you know and SCREAM each one of these statements at  them if you think/feel --&rt; they think (or feel) they are smarter,  more important, or more special than you. They don’t need to be present.  So don’t just say them out loud, but repeat them with conviction.</p>
<p>Share them if you like.</p>
<p>If you want go an extra mile you can use a modified form:</p>
<ol>
<li>You shall never feel special</li>
<li>You shall never feel important</li>
<li>You shall never feel smart</li>
<li>You shall never feel anyone cares about you</li>
<li>You shall never feel you can teach us anything</li>
</ol>
<p>Extra mile+ if you substitute I and/or WE for YOU and project it on yourself. But one thing at a time.</p>
<p><strong>You can BE any of these traits, but you/we don't want the feeling. That leads to inflated power tripping egos.</strong></p>
<p>A BBC video about Jante Law. Many more on Youtube.</p>
