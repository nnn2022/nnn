    <strong>This will continue even after vaccines</strong>
    <p><p>In the UK between 10,000 and 14,000 people die of old age per day pre COVID and post COVID, majority of these people will be admitted to hospitals from falls etc. Hospitals have proven to be breeding grounds for COVID, the patients will have a very low immune system which will make it much easier to catch COVID.</p>
<p>We also know that these miraculous vaccines don't affect transmission so it will still be going around as normal, then once they have caught COVID it doesn't matter if they were going to die anyway it will still be counted as a COVID death and the agenda can be pushed yet again.</p>
<p>I see no way out of this and don't believe their prediction that 'things will be much better by Easter' and every day goes by I am just losing more hope.</p></p>

        <p>It’s funny that a lot of new streaming services, such as Disney+ and HBOMax, launched right before or during the pandemic. These services take years of planning and development and they happened to launch right when people were asked to stay at home. Lucky break for them I guess.</p>

<p>Look at event 201 a few weeks before omg covid!
If a bank robber put up their plans to rob a bank, then the bank got robbed a couple of weeks later, would we all believe they hadn’t robbed the bank?</p>

        <p>Certainly not a scenario I'd dismiss out of hand to be fair</p>
<p>I'm certainly not expecting good things for 2021 whether that be an increased stranglehold <em>or</em> a deadlier version after a dry run</p>
<p>I did say in February we'd be locked down at Christmas - people looked at me like I was crazy, come March they were 'come on people, we can do this for three weeks!' - they did yet here we are - I just laughed at their naiveté</p>

        <p>To be fair I was cautious in March, but the more I  saw the news wasn’t reflecting what we were seeing the deeper my mistrust became. I was always sceptical but I figured Pascal’s wager was the right mentality. But here we are today, looking at our world in ruins.</p>

        <p>I think there are many like you, slowly realising all isn't as we are being told (I've witnessed this happen in my wider family) and I think deep down, those who rabidly attack us for our views are feeling the same but refusing to admit it...I guess realising that your Government isn't the benevolent body you thought it was and the fact that almost everything you've been told is too painful a realisation for some?</p>
<p>I can't even express how much I wish everything I predicted even <em>before</em> this was real 'big news' had been wrong... I'm always happy to be proven wrong especially with something of this magnitude</p>
<p>It's funny, many of us so-called 'truthers' have been warning of the things we are seeing happening now for years and we were roundly mocked for it; but it's all unfolding as we warned (these predictions weren't just pulled out of our heads) but tbh even I am shocked by how quick it's come about - I did think it was possible it wouldn't happen in my lifetime yet here we are 😔</p>
<p>It's established and observable fact that once governments grab power and take freedoms they <em>never</em> willingly give them back...</p>

        <p>I always knew government was full of self interested sociopaths, I just didn’t think it was this easy to pull the wool over everyone’s eyes. I remember the Iraq war protests, and how the government didn’t listen to us then. Most peons seem to have forgotten that. I am guilty of thinking they wouldn’t pull that shit on us again, but this feels worse by several orders of magnitude. I think I’ve seen politics and people get progressively more shallow and empty over my life span. People seem to have short memories, and are easily distracted by pointless scandals.</p>

        <p>Yea it's definitely disturbing how they've pulled this one off so easily isn't it?</p>
<p>You mentioning remembering the Iraq war protests makes me wonder - a lot of the really young - this is probably their first taste of media manipulation and they don't recognise it maybe?</p>
<p>Who can forget the Govt's blatant lies (UK and USA) and their disgusting lap-dog media happily peddling them?
The WMD's that weren't, the babies being pulled out of incubators by 'evil Iraqi's' that was complete theatre and pure propaganda? Dr Kelly's 'suicide'? Not I!</p>
<p>I agree people are easily distracted, especially now - distracted by TikTok, the Kardashians etc - so distracted they fail to see what's actually in front of them...'reality' seems to be completely shaped only by that which they see on their mobile screens</p>
<p>All I'm certain of is that they will <em>keep</em> pulling this crap and being ever more blasé about it, because 99% of people are just allowing them to... it's a sad state of affairs and I dread to think how bad things have to get before people wake up to it?</p>

        <p>I think this is a likely scenario but I don't think it'll play out how we imagine it, I think the deaths will be from the vaxx and they are going to use the cover it's a new strain and by then in 2025 there will be SPARS that comes to the scene</p>

        <p>If you saw the stupid "social distancing" signs on the floor of every goddamn store and stupid plexiglass in front of the cashiers from the first day of "2 weeks to flatten the curve" and didn't realize this was a long term and permanent plan, then you were really naive to say the least.</p>

        <p>And the plexiglass isn’t protesting the cashier at all as there’s still three sides around the cashier that are exposed.  Plus they are wearing a mask so why the shelf? What about the stocker or the person behind the deli or bakery counter? Don’t they get shelds</p>

        <p>100% agree... we need a Nuremburg style court to get out the information that this virus is NOT as scary as it has been made out to be.</p>
<p>In fact I think that most people 'killed' by CoVid-19 are actually killed by the ventilators.</p>
