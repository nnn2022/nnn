    <strong>Nursing home with near unbearable covid regulations</strong>
    <p><p>My grandmother recently moved to live closer to us. The nursing home, when we toured it in April, had no covid regulations and masks were compulsory. When we moved her in around May, that had completely changed. </p>
<p>Not only were they requiring masks, but they checked temperature too. And the women at the front desk were total Karens. I didn't mind at first, I felt kind of bamboozled, but it's a nursing home. More strict regulations are understandable. </p>
<p>Well, those feelings changed when they implemented the "kiosks." </p>
<p>It's a tablet for checking in, like a guest book, only electronic. And more invasive. </p>
<p>It asked you your full name.</p>
<p>Address</p>
<p>Phone Number</p>
<p>Vaccination Status</p>
<p>Uses a video camera to read your temperature, likely taking a picture of you as well</p>
<p>And then, to top it all off, at the end it asks you to agree to a list of terms and conditions to; I kid you not; <strong>"Help us Maintain the New Normal."</strong> </p>
<p>To make it better you have some bitch from the front desk constantly looking over your shoulder, reading everything, and getting frustrated if you mess something up. </p>
<p>I just want to see my grandmother. She has the vaccine, by their "logic" she should be safe. But they literally have no logic, they live in fear and anger and hatred for anyone not like them. They do not understand how corona viruses work, they do not understand how vaccines work, they are creatures driven entirely by their own resentment.</p></p>

        <p>Try to find a way to get her out of there. Nursing homes are expensive. Could she live with a family member and have a home nurse? I had to move my dad into my home when covid first became a thing because they wouldn't let me see him at all, and that's unacceptable. It really boils my blood the way the elderly have been and are treated throughout this joke of a pandemic in the name of keeping them safe. It's truly criminal.</p>
