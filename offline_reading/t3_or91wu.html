    <strong>They will never admit it's the vaccine causing your sickness</strong>
    <p><p>I wrote my testimony yesterday about how I was disabled by medical malpractice here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/oqm2ob/disabled_by_medical_malpractice_still_being/">https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/oqm2ob/disabled_by_medical_malpractice_still_being/</a></p>
<p>I describe how I was severely harmed by a drug called Ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic that has a 46 page side effect profile including tendon rupture, permanent nerve damage, retinal detachment, and aortic dissection. Many of these side effects would be considered cruel as a pesticides for a roach infestation in your home, and are much worse than a quick infection that kills you in a few days.</p>
<p>There is no cell in the human body that drug won't destroy. It is a systemic weapon of mass destruction that takes YEARS to recover from, and some never do. </p>
<p>Why am I telling you the story again? As a warning of the reaction I got from the doctors.</p>
<p>I went to the ER day 5 after stopping the drug, unable to walk. My Achilles tendons were on fire, I had shock sensations going up and down my body, and searing white hot nerve pain in my hamstring.</p>
<p>The PA said she'd "never heard of that" and told me "go home, I treat life threatening emergencies here." The nurse then offered me a Toradol, which is an NSAID. NSAIDs are contraindicated with Cipro and are not to be given together, or for the months and years you are experiencing symptoms of Cipro. Many harmed by Cipro warn to never take them again for fear of relapsing. They simply didn't know this at the hospital. Neither did my urologist, who prescribed Cipro and another NSAID TOGETHER. It is likely this severely worsened this effect the drug had on me.</p>
<p>One week later, I went to the local pharmacy and asked what I could do. He looked at me slack jawed and dumb faced, and said Ibuprofen.</p>
<p>2 weeks later, I went to my PCP who knew me for several years as a healthy guy who walked a cool 10,000 steps a day and could do a 24 hour flight across the world, take a 4 hour nap and be ready to go on the other side. I came to him with braces on both ankles, holding onto the walls. He promptly told me "it wasn't the Cipro that did this." He then insisted maybe I had RA and wanted me to go for tests. He then offered a steroid. Steroids are ALSO contraindicated with Cipro and not to be described during or after the reaction. </p>
<p>4 months later, I went to a podiatrist for the severe, persisting nerve damage in my ankle. He quickly cut me off and said "Cipro has nothing to do with this, and I prescribe NSAIDs with it all the time." He admitted to Malpractice on the spot.</p>
<p>My brother, in his pharmacy residency, argued with me for months that I was dealing with "muscle atrophy" from being in bed and wanted me checked for ankylosing spondylitis, a spinal condition.</p>
<p>All of this after my body was basically bombed within days of starting this drug that the FDA warned about 4 separate times.</p>
<p>I had to have my left ankle surgically repaired with 41 staples after severe tendon damage occurred, and I will need the other ankle fixed as well.</p>
<p>Here is the label to Cipro: <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2016/019537s086lbl.pdf">https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2016/019537s086lbl.pdf</a></p>
<p>You can keyword search steroids and NSAIDs. Doctors are pharmacists have no idea what the drugs they dispense are even capable of. And the ones that do will always deny it is the drug doing it. They either A. hate their patients and believe we're all hypochondriacs who read the label and imagined it or B. know what they're doing is murder and are covering it up.</p>
<p>They will do the same for the vaccine. You can go in, faint, and have a seizure before you can even pull down you're sleeve, and they will send you to the hospital already having ruled out the vaccine doing it. If you die in the hospital 2 hours later they'll call it natural causes. While all this was going on, my grandfather died mysteriously 3 weeks after the first shot. This was after he kicked Covid's ass in August of 2019. His death was ruled a "stroke".</p>
<p>We already know the companies cannot be held liable, and I also do not have the option for a lawsuit, due to using generic drug and insert providing me "adequate" warning.</p>
<p>Vaccines are only "safe" because the people in charge of it's safety profile also control the information around it, the adverse reaction rates. When they say it's "extremely rare", it's because they've agreed to only report a miniscule percentage of the reactions. They can't say 0, but they're not going to admit the true numbers, so they'll say something ridiculous like 1 in 100,000.</p>
<p>Before you trust your doctor when he tells you a synthetic chemical that was rushed is very safe, just understand if it cripples you, you are roadkill to him. Don't make the same mistake I did.</p></p>

        <p>Thank you! Actually, the first ankle surgery was considered successful. I got a new tendon allograft and my pain levels are down. I am still not able to walk a month out, but a few more weeks maybe. I'm going to have the other one fixed before the end of the year and with any luck, I may be walking normally by the spring.</p>

        <p>I am praying for you my friend, each and every step in your journey you take, both in your personal recovery and through this global madness.</p>
<p>Never lose hope, and never lose your spirit. Those are the most important assets you can ever have, no matter your age.</p>
<p>I also have a friend who's almost 30 who had to learn how to walk again due to hip surgery (she has Crohn's). She is now able to walk with her cane and drive on her own. </p>
<p>I believe in you and I'm glad that the pain has gone down so far :) I hope it continues that way for you. Carpe Diem!</p>

        <p>As someone who has taken cipro once in the past and was considering asking my doctor for another dose for a tenacious UTI, I am so happy I came across this post. She wouldn't give me cipro before because she said there were a lot of side effects but I had no idea it was this drastic. I am so sorry for what you've gone through, especially because of the negligence of the doctors. It's completely disgusting. I completely agree with your assertion in the title and at the end of your post. I hope you have a full recovery and a good life. Thank you for speaking up</p>

        <p>Having no side effects on a past prescription is not an indicator of a future tolerance of the drug. Everybody needs to understand this about Cipro and its class. There is a cumulative affect. There are many stories of people being fine with 1, 2, 3 prescriptions and getting destroyed on the 4th. There is reason to believe the fluoroquinolone is stored in our bodies, and thus the next one may be the one that tips you into toxicity threshold.</p>

        <p>I am really thankful to read your story. I have been on cipro in the past, probably 2 or 3 times, for a UTI. I will never ever take it again after reading your posts. I had absolutely no idea it could be so dangerous.</p>

<li>For women especially - homemade cranberry juice: put in a wrap-and-boil bag a bunch of cranberries, tie it closed, and boil it in a pot of water with some raw honey. It becomes a concentrate that you can dilute to your tastes. There's evidence that (refined-sugar-free) cranberry juice helps bacteria slide out of the urinary tract.</li>

        <p>My stupid doctor prescribed the antibiotic that fucked you up -I read the wikipedia article on any medicine I am supposed to take. Read all the horror information about Ciprofloxacin. Called him, he prescribed a different one. Not before arguing that I shouldn‘t read that stuff and it‘s super rare and he never saw it. Talked to a different doctor on the same issue I was taking antibiotics for -he also made fun of my fears!</p>

<p>By the way, I am an isotretinoin damaged person. It‘s a medication that kills acne dermatologists hand out like candy. It can cause (all permanent!) severe dry eye, digestive problems, dry skin and depression. I had phases of eye pain so bad, I cried and wanted to die. I was suffering from chronic eye pain that made me almost unable to live a normal life until I found the right medications to manage my disease.</p>

        <p>Same here. Ive almost finished with the video about what happened to me, it might be boring to most people though. I wasn't going to share it to this sub, but I may anyway and watch it get shot down in flames.</p>
<p>I can prove everything that happened to me, and I am still being lied to about it. So there doesnt seem like anything I can do. For my sanity, I am making a record of the incident, publishing the documentation that they would give me and people can decide if the government is acting in my best interest or not and forgetting things and moving on.</p>

        <p>It's a rigged system. Medical malpractice requires a doctor of the same field throwing one of his own under a bus. I would need to get a urologist, whose undoubtedly prescribed Cipro thousands of times, to state under oath that another urologist committed malpractice for giving it to me for pelvic pain. I can't sue the manufacturer because I took generic. We're forced to take generic because insurance won't cover the name brand. And it doesn't matter how much doctors and pharmacists downplay the side effects, they can say it's 1 in a trillion in the office, and then when it happens they fall back on "well it is rare, but it does happen. It says it on the insert" Medical malpractice lawsuits are the equivalent of internal investigations where the police investigate themselves. It's setup so you can never sue.</p>

        <p>I’m so sorry this happened to you. A doctor prescribed me Cipro over the phone (!) in March 2020 for a suspected (!) UTI. I ended up googling the drug and read so many stories just like yours, and ultimately decided not to take it. It’s so unfair this happened to you. </p>
<p>I’ve spent the last decade of my career working with extremely educated and intelligent attorneys — and they still fuck stuff up, get blinded by bias, and act with self interest all the time. They’re just humans. It was such a valuable lesson to learn at a young age— that even the “experts” don’t know what they’re doing a lot of the time. Many people have yet to realize this applies to everyone — judges, doctors, engineers, psychiatrists. All normal humans capable of fucking shit up. Be skeptical of literally everyone.</p>

        <p>It was when covid was really just getting started, so they wouldn’t let me come in and confirm I had a UTI with a test even though my symptoms hadn’t gone away with other antibiotics (so tbf, we tried other stuff first, but never with a confirmed UTI). And he mentioned zero side effects when he prescribed the Cipro. If I needed it to save my life, ok, but at least adequately inform me of the risks. And I didn’t even end up having a UTI.</p>

        <p>I disagree, when I was given cipro it did literally save my life (I got it for sepsis) and I am glad I'm still alive, but it's such a brutal drug and I have no idea why they prescribe it ahead of "conventional" antibiotics in so many cases. They should NEVER prescribe it for just a UTI.</p>

        <p>Sepsis or anthrax is just about the only thing it could possibly be approved for. And there should be written informed consent, meaning the doctor has to get a signature from you or your power of attorney that they went over all the major side effects on the black box warning. I've had a doctor tell me that's not practical because "we'd be here all day", and maybe that's the problem isn't it? I'm not going to tell you what will happen to your body because it would take me too long.</p>

        <p>To be fair to the doctor who prescribed it, she told me straight up it's the "nuclear option" and "like a chemo drug" but I was so sick that I was genuinely afraid I would die within 24 hours so I would have taken anything.   </p>
<p>The numerous comments on this thread alone by people who got it for UTIs though are extremely concerning, it is one of if not the most dangerous antibiotic(s) on the market and most UTIs are mild and don't even require abx at all.</p>

        <p>The same way cops will protect cops, regardless of their wrong-doing, the medical industry protects itself when it harms innocent people. The only difference the medical industry has better marketing and the veneer of 'caring.' People are at least more sober about cops, and can see whether they are harmful or lawful individuals. But the medical industry is given carte blanche about their harms. It's like questioning the clergy centuries ago. One woman owes $180,000 in hospital bills after she took the first dose of Pfizer and ended up in the ICU.  <a href="https://theempoweror.com/2021/05/17/adrianas-pfizer-covid-vaccine-reaction-has-left-her-with-180k-in-medical-bills/">link</a> Are any of the people who pressured her to take it, her doctors, her friends, family, the media, the government - are any of them going to donate a single penny to her?

        <p>This is anecdotal so take it for what you will but I recently had surgery and they had to retake my blood oxygen level because the nurse said ‘89%? That’s really low’ (taken with a mask on my face) and honestly, as truthful as I can be here, I did feel a little ‘light headed’ after having to walk 3 flights of stairs with it on, it felt like I couldn’t catch my breath very well. </p>
<p>Once I took the mask off for a few minutes, blood oxygen was normal again.  </p>
<p>I’m considering buying myself a little finger monitor so I can verify this result. Im not prone to hysterics  or anything but if my blood oxygen was that low for an extended period that could be bad. When I first heard stories about this, I dismissed it. ‘Well that’s probably just fat people or old people who have a hard time breathing as is’… well it’s definitely not just them.</p>

<p>&rt;We objectified evaluation evidenced changes in respiratory physiology of mask wearers with significant correlation of O2 drop and fatigue (p &lt; 0.05), a clustered co-occurrence of respiratory impairment and O2 drop (67%), N95 mask and CO2 rise (82%), N95 mask and O2 drop (72%), N95 mask and headache (60%), respiratory impairment and temperature rise (88%), but also temperature rise and moisture (100%) under the masks.</p>
<p>You're not imagining it. The narrative that they aren't an inconvenience is banking on people being too braindead to notice they're oxygen deprived.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I refused to give birth in a hospital last April. Among everything else going on (the hospital had COVID patients in the maternity ward across the hall from recovering mothers!), I refuse to labor in a mask. It's hard work and I need to breathe!</p>
<p>My midwife ended up coming to me and I gave birth at home.</p>

        <p>I had to labor with a mask in November. They did not make me wear it while pushing..but I had to do a Covid test prior to coming in, why did I have to labor in a mask!? It was horrible.</p>

        <p>Hey man I had exactly the same reaction. I'm 6 years out and I'm mostly better. Still have gastric and sinus issues pretty bad though. Joint's play up here and there. Brainfog is nearly 100% better too. TRT really helped me out and if your hormonal profile supports it I'd highly reccomend it.<br>
I faced years of gaslighting and being told I was crazy, given mental health diagnoses by doctors not qualified to do so. Our countries guidelines changed about 4 years after my reaction, listing nearly every symptom I was complaining about. My GP's reaction was to throw me out of the service after confronting them.</p>
<p>I get treat with much more respect now.  </p>
<p>Wishing you the best man. It's a long road but things can get better.</p>

Good luck to you man. Hope the surgery works and you're a few steps closer to normal.</p>

<p>That was years ago. My experience with hospitals and doctors have been terrible. Most of these people memorize all kinds of fancy words but have little practical knowledge.

        <p>Exactly the same for me. Antipsychotic AND antidepressant combined. For me I took it only a couple weeks but it messed me up for maybe 5-10 years. Now I’m totally okay. There were immediate changes after those 2 weeks in my mental state  that were hard to change. </p>

<p>I don't trust the medical system at all anymore. I've had chronic problems all my life, which likely started with infant vaxx and later anti-biotics, and doctors have been beyond useless, also just wanted to sell me pharma drugs every time, instead of doing any testing.</p>
<p>In most instances, getting "medical attention" really is worse than doing nothing at all. </p>

        <p>The level of incompetence, apathy, and ignorance I’ve encountered among multiple doctors in the US is staggering.</p>
<p>My wife had to convince her doctor she had scarlet fever when she has every symptom including the bright red rash on her face. The dumbass brought out his fucking textbook and started looking through it with her. She finally forced them to give her a culture test instead of the unreliable rapid test. Rapid test came back negative, culture came back positive.</p>
<p>I have found one good doctor among the five I’ve been to in my state. And lo and behold, he just happens to be in favor of taking vitamin D, C and zinc as prophylaxis against covid, and only getting the vaccine if you’re old or in a vulnerable category.</p>

        <p>Everything you need to be healthy can be found in nature or obtained for free.</p>
<p>Exercise, sunshine, fresh air, good food, good sleep, love and friendship.</p>
<p>Naturally, there is very little profit in such things, so the modern medical establishment, which is one the biggest rackets in human history, has no interest in them.</p>
<p>Instead, they want to sell you something.  And 99% of what they sell you is toxic garbage that may temporarily suppress your symptoms while exacerbating the underlying pathology or even creating new pathologies.  This is how they make you a patient for life and extract the maximum profit from you.  And if you somehow realize what they're doing, they immediately begin gaslighting you.</p>

        <p>I was also prescribed cipro for UTI, I already have significant damage to my Achilles tendon from a previous accident, while I was on cipro I felt my tendon just pop, it hurt so bad, but because of my previous accident it was just assumed it was from that, but it got worse so I looked up info on cipro, and I was just pissed, you would think a doctor who knows your medical history would not give you a pill that causes damage to something your already have a predisposition to, its like when they try to give me nerve medication that causes depression and breathing difficulties knowing full well I suffer from Asthma and depression, when you relay this info to doctors they just look at you like your a moron, its so fu*king irritating, I'm sorry you had to go through this, and I hope your up and walking again soon.</p>

        <p>This scares the shit out of me. I was put on Cipro after the Dr. left a sponge in me after surgery. I shit myself for about a year after but recovered. I do have left hand tremors now- I’m hoping this is NOT the reason as the on set is literally 5 years after</p>

        <p>Right now I am getting annoyed by these smug injection takers. "I got the vaccine, and I'm okay."  They really are not displaying any signs of problems... at least not yet. When the latent damage or effects come the medical system, the media, and even the injection takers will all be attributing it to something else.</p>

        <p>Thank you. I stand point the point that it's unacceptable how many of your colleagues don't know this. Many doctors who prescribe it don't know it either. And it's not rare. It's significantly underreported due to doctor hesitancy and delayed reactions.</p>

        <p>I feel you OP. Last year I had a similar situation with getting floxxed. I was isolated in rural California unable to use my body the way it worked just prior to the antibiotics.I had to take 2 sounds of that stuff with increasing amounts. The 2nd round I blacked out and the Dr told me to finish the medication still.
Could barely walk correctly, definitely couldn't use my hands to even hold a phone or fork to cut a fried egg.  I've never felt more alone and confused in my own body. The physical distress was almost as difficult to recover from as the mental issues. My pattern of thought was erratic and moody. Luckily I've studied meditation and yoga for the past 10 years and was able to rely heavily of those to help my recovery, which is still ongoing. 
When I went back for a checkup with the Dr., his reaction was, "I've heard this happens frequently to tall, slender, athletic white men". WTF, why prescribe that then? He didn't care much. Most difficult thing was is that he cautioned me to not overstretch cause I would tare my tendon. I was then afraid to practice my yoga, the only thing that would get my body back, but still could make me worse.
I feel you and I've used this as a supportive reason why I'm not keen to get any new drug. People then tell me to not worry, it's not like that.
Oh, okay. Sure.</p>

        <p>Thanks for your account and I totally understand where you’re coming from - until you’ve been burned by the healthcare industry (and it IS an INDUSTRY where the bottom line is the driver - make no mistake about it), it’s easy to sit back and tell people to trust all doctors or nurses or whomever.</p>
<p>I too was burned badly by the industry when I went in for a “routine” ovariectomy because I had a large fibroid tumor on my ovary.  Well...the surgery went well enough (apart from the fact that the surgeon decided to remove my perfectly fine appendix too because well - why not?)...but the next few days as I recovered were some of the worst of my life.</p>
<p>I was given a drug called “Inapsine” to control my anesthesia induced nausea.  The docs couldn’t have me puking as it was too much of a stress on my sutures...I had the old school surgery with a big 7 inch scar across my abdomen.  Anyway I was on a morphine drip the first day and then on the next day in the hospital the nurse comes in to gives me my shot of Inapsine for the nausea.  I was ok...but I must have gotten sick again so a few hours later another nurse arrives to give me a second shot...and I was ok still...until a third nurse arrives a few more hours later for a third shot and I’ll never forget it, clear as day...I’m watching TV from my bed and I didn’t feel right... my friend was visiting at the time and I don’t know if my stomach muscles seized up first but she got scared and calls the nurse.  I could still talk at that time so I tell the nurse I don’t feel right - my muscles feel tight and are contracting.  She tells me to relax - that I’m anxious.  I know it’s not anxiety....</p>
<p>Anyway the contractions get worse - they spread across my trunk, up to my neck and face - my mouth starts clenching so bad I feel like my teeth my crack, my head is yanking back, my eyes roll back and I can’t lift my head properly.  The doctors arrive and my friend, terrified is sent home.  I can still think clearly, and my mind is spinning- “what is happening?  Why is this happening to me?”  The docs have no answer.  </p>
<p>This goes on for hours and hours.  The doctors and nurses give me an injection of steroids- it does nothing.  Then they try Valium - it helps for about 5 minutes and the contractions come back.  I’m terrified because I’m all alone at the hospital, 19 years old, and the docs have NO idea what’s going on or how to fix it.  They say they’ve never seen this before.  All the while, each contraction pulls on my stitches and I can barely keep my tongue from rolling back and choking me.  Thank God that didn’t happen!</p>
<p>Long story short, they FINALLY send up the pharmacist who reviews my chart.  He sits at the end of my bed flipping through the pages.  He sees the Inapsine and I guess thinks “let’s try an antihistamine.”  So they give me an IV Benadryl and like some miracle it works - and quickly.  Within 5 minutes the contractions subside.</p>
<p>But my saga doesn’t end here.  I always had some anxiety in life...but after this ordeal it set-off the worst OCD in me ever - and I’m pretty certain this drug kicked it off.  I never had OCD prior, but then it took over my life.  I kept wondering- what IF this happens again?  What IF it just comes back?  And on it went.</p>
<p>It took years and years of therapy to get where I am today, and this was many years ago - before the Internet was so popular and you could gather information on other people’s responses to a drug easily.</p>
<p>I subsequently learned that Inapsine has destroyed many people’s lives - yet we’re called “rare.”  An extremely “rare” Dystonic reaction.  Or an extremely “rare” reaction that caused anxiety or Akathisia.  And know one knows why.  No one knows why some of us react this way.</p>
<p>The worst part as many know - is being told it’s all in your head.  Or that because they don’t know what’s going on you’re making it up or exaggerating.  Or the worst of all - you want attention.</p>
<p>Luckily I didn’t quite face that, but I got a taste of it when that first nurse told me to “relax - try to relax.”</p>
<p>And now with these EXPERIMENTAL jabs people are told to blindly trust the researchers!???  As if the medical Industry has all the answers?</p>
<p>It took YEARS for Inapsine to finally get a black box warning...and It didn’t even get it for causing Dystonias or Akathesia - noooo that’s so rare those of us who have that are just the rare ones.  Instead it got it for prolonging the QT interval.</p>
<p>So what’s my point?  A) I am SO sorry you’re still suffering at the hands of cipro and it being wantonly doled out to you like a candy bar B) that when docs say they have it all figured out the simply don’t - that’s untrue C) you never know where you may fall in the bell curve and as such no drug should ever be indiscriminately rolled out let alone forced on ANY human and D) we are witnessing the biggest human rights violations of our times</p>
<p>Oh and lastly- nothing teaches you more than experience, and unfortunately many can only seem to learn this way.</p>

        <p>Dear Flamingo, I am so sorry this happened to you. I'm a physician assistant who worked with a spinal cord injury, and a 143 IQ, unfortunately I was harmed by the medical profession myself when a lumbar puncture pierced my already injured cauda equina nerves.</p>
<p>I now suffer from chronic spinal meningitis and scar tissue that causes bone cancer like pain. Thank goodness I now receive incredible care with 6 yearly ketamine infusions, which take the pain from a 10 to 0 for a few weeks, ketamine is also neuro regenerative and anti-inflammatory.</p>
<p>A physician researcher named John Ioannidis at Stanford University performed a landmark meta research study, his conclusion is that 50% of all medical research, including even the top 10 studies, are total bunk. Let's just say that he didn't make any new friends with the AMA, other physicians and Big Pharma.</p>
<p>Dr John Ioannidis performed another landmark study analyzing the Princess Diamond data from that cruise ship that was quarantined. He warned against overreacting to a virus that most likely has a 0.26% IFR. This was published mid-march of 2020 and of course he was vilified once again.</p>
<p>After my skydiving accident it took me roughly 13, 14 years to become a physician assistant and I was only able to work for a decade as unbeknownst to me my body was developing chronic meningitis (adhesive arachnoiditis). I live my life mostly in my hospital bed, lost my career and all my savings. However I'm one of the lucky ones with adhesive arachnoiditis, because although it is a rare disease and ketamine is not a cure, I find life worth living.</p>
<p>I wrote an evidence-based memoir The Queen of Ketamine, started doing stand-up from my power wheelchair and recently and very unexpectedly made beautiful art that gives my life meaning. My mom was an artist, she died last year 4 months after my dad and it feels as if I inherited her creativity. But words cannot express enough the suffering I have endured since my diagnosis in 2015. I have been close to ending it but now I'm glad I'm still alive. </p>
<p>In 2020 I was seen at the ER of the academic hospital where I receive ketamine treatment; I was dismayed by the narcissism the vapid chattiness, overall rudeness and total fucking stupidity of nurses and ER physicians. </p>
<p>I completely understand your situation. I wish you the very best and and most of all, healing.</p>

        <p>Please this is important that we fight against this. We do not want to be forced every year to be vaxed if this vax is not fully tested and in trial. Share, like and follow stories of the people affected. Many of us here are afraid to talk openly because of the fear of losing jobs or friends but we can show support in many ways. I just cannot believe that with so many people against lockdowns, new normal, forced vaccinations  we are in this point.</p>

        <p>I was prescribed Cipro as a teenager for a simple UTI. When my aunt found out, she went ballistic. It is insane how nonchalant these professionals are about administering this shit. I’m sorry that you’re going through this and I hope that your surgeries go well.</p>

        <p>I've been disabled long enough to know the reality of life now if something goes wrong, the doctor's basically shrug their shoulders and say "Tough luck, kid". They don't diagnose. In fact, I have a new problem, I have to focus on and go research to figure out what is happening and yes I have had to do this before. They took 25 years to diagnose a disease where side effects almost killed me a few times. Hell even I knew Cipro could affect tendons, so how many C and D students are crawling out of med school nowadays?</p>

        <p>Most doctors don't even think that much about it really. They just get told by labs from pharmaceutical companies "use this to treat that, it's safe and effective" and they just do it, not even questionning the medecine. </p>
<p>It usually takes years for a dangerous medicine to be put off the market and it's usually because of one doctor who started questionning things. Most doctors won't even think that far.</p>

        <p>I was seething with rage while reading this. For the people who did that to you rotting in a cell is too kind a fate.</p>
<p>When my mother had cancer the surgeon asked me straight forward for money under the table(in addition to what they get from the state) to perform the surgery and because it wasn't as much as he expected he butchered her in all ways you can imagine. Forgotten tool causing puss build up,bad stitching leading to internal bleeding and hernias,spleen fluid building up and bursting out from an incision... I've no idea how she's still alive.</p>

        <p>I’m so so sorry you’re experiencing this. Have you considered alternative medicine to help you recover? I have no idea what the protocol would or could be, but personally I’d look for the best functional med doctor around and some amazing physical therapists/body workers (cranial sacral therapy, fascia therapy, chiropractors) and see if together they can’t all help you regain a little bit of your normalcy back. </p>
<p>Best of luck ❤️</p>

        <p>It's honestly disgusting how much they hate human suffering, if that suffering happens to go against their political opinions. No one should ever have to go through what you had to. I imagine from a mental health perspective everyone acting like you're making it up is even worse than the medical effects.</p>

        <p>&rt;Vaccines are only "safe" because the people in charge of it's safety profile also control the information around it, the adverse reaction rates. When they say it's "extremely rare", it's because they've agreed to only report a miniscule percentage of the reactions. 99.9% of they time, they're trained to tell you it's not the vaccine doing it. Let's say they admitted 20% of people had at least moderate side effects. Would anyone take it? No, so if 100 patients complain in a month, that doesn't fit the 1 in 100,000 number they were told by "official sources". So by definition most of the patients have to be lying. They have a confirmation bias for this predetermined number that they chose during the miniscule clinical trials.. They can't say 0, but they're not going to admit the true numbers, so they'll say something ridiculous like 1 in 100,000.</p>
<p>I think this is what's happening more or less with adverse reactions regarding the vaccines. There are little to no protocols on how to detect adverse reactions, because they just don't perform autopsies on people getting strokes a few days or weeks after the vaccine. They assume it could not have been the vaccine, and move on. So we simply don't know and keep remaining in the dark. And of course, both pharma companies and doctors have absolutely zero incentive to look into it, because: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Whoever question the vaccines is considered an anti-vax monster, </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pharma surely won't fund research to look more closely into potentially business destroying side effects, and </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The science behind it may be counterintuitive, more complex than we imagine, and the mechanism of actions might take months and years to take effects in most patients.</p>

        <p>Yep. The people responsible for doing the work to figure out the real adverse reaction rate are the same ones selling it. And the propaganda about how safe vaccines are is incessant. It's reached a cult like fever pitch. No other medical procedure is so sacred that others believe it's their right to force it on you.</p>

        <p>Doctors really don't know shit...story of my life.  I've had chronic fatigue, POTS, and histamine intolerance for 14 years and have seen a few dozen docs and none of them have a clue.  They've never even heard of many of the natural things I'd bring up to them to ask questions about (Naturopaths were a little better with that).  I had to figure it all out on my own doing my own research and finally figured it all out a couple years ago.  Do you own due diligence, people!!!  Take an active role in your health.</p>

<p>The other day he complained to me that at least so far med school doesn’t really teach you how to solve problems or leave a lot of room for the doctor to make decisions. It’s more of a stick to the protocol/manual training. </p>
<p>He’s a normie and had the vaccine. Despite his sentiment he still hasn’t quite made the connections though.</p>

        <p>Thank you for sharing your story. I also suffered terrible side effects of hormonal treatment at a young age and was fully diagnosed only 10 years after. Doctors didn't want to listen to me and were rude to me. It took many visits to different specialists in two countries to establish what is my disease and nobody has ever been held accountable for it. I do not believe in the phrase benefits outweigh risks. None vaccine should be deemed safe to use if side effects are so serious. I do not want to play Russian Rullette every year. I have heard they want that people take it every year. I took it because of travel problems and I am afraid to think about the future. Please check the story of Lita and show her your support: https://instagram.com/advocate4lita?utm_medium=copy_link
You can follow the profile, like pics or simply share her story. I think it is bad if cases  like this are silenced. If any vaccine can have such a side effect the pharmaceutical companies should work hard on improved version and retract this one. I am not anti vax or conspiracy or whether they are trying to label critically thinking people with.</p>

        <p>Oh man, I was prescribed cipro years ago and after the first dose I had some very noticeable joint pain and called my pharmacist right away. The pharmacist told me to stop taking it, but those fuckers didn't warn me about it at all, and to this day I tell this story to family and friends. Who knows how fucked I would be if I kept taking that shit.</p>
<p>Same thing happened to me with another antibiotic amoxicillin I think, and they tried to gaslight me by saying its not a side effect for that one. How many FDA approved drugs are just pure poison? How is anyone supposed to trust any medical authority when they peddle drugs like that.</p>

        <p>Oh my god I had a horrible reaction to this drug when i was 17. It was New Year’s Eve and I took it for a uti. The ER and ambulance crew thought I was on drugs. But I was just a kid at home with my parents on an antibiotic. I was hallucinating and truly felt like I was dying. I am so so certain that if I took this drug again I would die.

        <p>I’m a scientist so I already know I’m going to be able to make better medical decisions for myself than my doctor. Sorry that sounds egotistic but you have to be your biggest advocate. I have proof of this in several instances, one specifically where I was experiencing a rosacea outbreak to a chemical and they thought it was an allergic reaction and an urgent care doctor prescribed me steroids. I went home and did a deep dive and came to the conclusion it was rosacea. I scheduled an appointment with my primary care doctor, who said I was correct after going through my symptoms. I was later prescribed Ivermectin for this, funnily enough</p>
<p>I’ve seen the gaslighting about drugs a lot. Just the other day someone posted about taking SSRIs and having long-term sexual dysfunction, even going off the drugs. People in the comments were 100% calling him a schizo nutcase and saying it might be hormonal. But one pubmed search shows this is absolutely a known side effect and has nothing to do with hormones, the drug itself changes your gene regulation and even off the drug you can have long-term epigenetic changes. Most doctors don’t even understand this.</p>

        <p>Also a scientist and have made better medical decisions for myself than doctors for years, but the problem is that doctors HATE this. At least most of the doctors I have seen HATE this and will prescribe shit I really don't need while refusing to prescribe things I need, or gaslighting me telling me it's probably "stress" or whatever. They seem to get even more aggro when you actually know what you're talking about and are better educated about the body systems you have issues with than they are.</p>

        <p>That...well sucks. I got tinnitus after taking antibiotics for h. Pylori. Which if I'd been more informed, I could have more than likely healed naturally. As it was drs just threw anti-anxiety meds at me for a year before I diagnosed myself and went to a naturopath. The crappy thing was that in a way those drs weren't entirely wrong as many stomach given issues are started with anxiety, fear and repressed emotions. 
You might be interested in Dr. Sarno and his book The Mind Body connection. I'd be interested to know how much of this covid has been psychosomatic.</p>

        <p>Did you not read about the part where I had multiple tendon tears ranging from my foot to the muscle belly of my calf? Imagine tearing your Achilles tendon, THEN IMAGINE TEARING IT IN MULTIPLE PLACES AND IT TOOK 41 STAPLES TO CLOSE THE WOUND. The symptoms weren't coming from my mind and they were not "repressed emotions", they were coming from HOLES IN MY CONNECTIVE TISSUE. Stop with the same "all in your head" quackery the doctors are pushing.</p>

        <p>I did. And that's not what I said. I wasn't implying that was all in your head. I can understand why you're being defensive. You got told that one to many times. This isn't saying the body can't be damaged only that smaller less obvious things like a backache can be more mental than physical. Our bodies are very powerful healing machines and yes even people recommended surgery have found relief through the brain. Again not ALL cases. But it never hurts to look at all sides.</p>

        <p>I was prescribed cipro for a urinary tract infection in college because I am allergic to sulfa medication, and I did not know what it was. I have always had a very clear mind and been able to function extremely well academically. After about a week, I could no longer think straight at all and cried while doing my statistics homework because it was suddenly much harder for me to focus or do anything. I saw a neurologist and still have damage due to this drug. I am so sorry that it has also impacted your life. I cannot fucking believe they're still giving this shit to people.</p>

        <p>Dunno why doctors blow off patients with odd illnesses or reactions caused by treatment. </p>
<p>Giving contra-indicated drugs is pretty messed up, although in some situations it might be a viable option. Still, IMHO the patient's medications MUST be reviewed when prescribing a new medication to make sure there's no contraindications, and if they are, the risks are analyzed. (NEVER mix viagra and nitroglycerin. Fatal drop in blood pressure. If patient has a bleeding risk take it into account before giving any blood thinners or anti-coagulant. etc.)</p>

        <p>I 100% believe you. My mom, son, and myself do not react to medications well. My mother took a new med and literally started uncontrollably running, and the doctor couldn’t figure out why. Uncontrolled movement was literally in the drug’s literature. But no, she said it wasn’t possible, even after my mom ran into a wall. Luckily my mom was smart enough to quit the drug after a few days and the running stopped. </p>
<p>My doctor prescribed me a drug that i didn’t ask for but she thought would be good for me (long story) and it ended up being taken off the market a few months later for causing mitral valve problems. She never bothered following you with me. </p>
<p>When my son was born at full term the nurse said he was only five pounds and had growth retardation. The paediatrician came and talked to me about supplemental feeding  and how much extra care he’d need. I spent the night crying and feeling like a terrible mother. The next morning my son was weighed again and he was almost 2 pounds heavier. It turned out the nurse hadn’t calibrated the scale the day before and my son was fine. </p>
<p>I have more of these stories but you get the point. I’m sorry that happened to you, it was way worse than anything we’ve dealt with. So frustrating. </p>
<p>Those experiences led me and my family to where we are today, though, and they’re why we won’t take the vaccine. So I’m grateful for that.</p>

        <p>I am very sorry you went thru this.  I avoid medications when possible.  I research home remedies or natural remedies for every ailment I have, try those first, and if they don't work, then go to the doctor.... and basically, I almost never go to the doctor.  The last time I went was about 7 years ago when I broke my ankle.  If I'm sick, I just let my immune system work through the illness itself - and I rarely get sick.  About 18 years ago, my mom and I both got MRSA at the same time.  She went to the doctor and was put on heavy antibiotics, I did nothing.  Our MRSA both cleared up at the same time.  Many of the natural remedies I use work much, much faster and better than the prescription drugs - such as garlic for sore throats and tea tree oil for skin problems.</p>
<p>I used to think home remedies were silly and western medicine was obviously the best treatment.  I first came to the realization western medicine was dangerous with my pets.  I noticed the kitties that I adored and took regularly to the vet were sick often and died far too young from illness and disease.  Our crazy cats that flipped out in car rides and were difficult to handle at the vets, so we rarely took them, lived very long, healthy lives.  My favorite kitty in the world died from a vaccine - and that really turned me around.</p>
<p>So I re-evaluated my stance and started using Eastern medicine and home remedies and healthy diet to heal myself and my pets, with great results.  I used to have bad allergies and asthma causing me to get sick often and having bronchitis annually, and have even turned those around.</p>
<p>Not sure if you knew this, but Rockfeller was mostly responsible for setting up our current medical education and licensing system - where medical students would receive pharmaceutical training, which he invested in.  Rockefeller himself refused to take pharmaceuticals because he realized they were dangerous poisons. He had a homeopathic doctor that cared for him and travelled with him.</p>
<p>Another point I like to make: there is no such thing as 'side-effects'... they are just 'effects'.  The medical community labels the undesirable effects as 'side-effects', but they are all effects, just the same, of taking a specific drug - some effects more pronounced than others, and it greatly varies which effects are more pronounced person to person.</p>
<p>I truly hope you are able to gain back some of your vitality.  I also hope you are supported and handling this mentally.  I imagine the anger and regret you have must be very difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>Best wishes and much love.</p>

        <p>Thankfully we haven’t had issues as bad as you, but my wife had a skin infection, and the doctors were just guessing on the medicine, and made it worse. What could’ve been 1 doctor visit and 1 specialist visit ended up being like 5 visits. </p>
<p>I had knee pain, perfect X-ray, perfect mri, no reason for knee pain. Had to figure it out myself, I have tight hamstrings and that pain is not knee pain it’s hamstring pain, now I stretch and the pain is gone. </p>
<p>I had low energy, got blood work done, perfect blood work, here take some pills. Nothing changed. Changed my diet, instantly better in 1 week. If you have low energy, try adding probiotics/Kifir to your diet. </p>
<p>I used to have so much faith in modern medicine. 90% of problems can be solved holistically, but doctors would rather just pump you up with pills and needles. </p>
<p>The thing is most doctors are great people, they’ve just been trained poorly, and they think they know it all because they are trained.</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry about what happened to you. I was prescribed cipro and had an awful experience with it as well although I ended up basically recovering (after about 3 months of being unable to walk normally but I doubt I sustained any permanent damage) but I DID have at least 2-3 other life-ruining pharma experiences, starting with getting prescribed high-dose steroids ALONGSIDE high-dose NSAIDs for a strained back muscle at the peak, prime of my health and athleticism.   </p>
<p>As anyone who knows about those drugs can imagine it was only a week or two of this before I developed such severe gastritis I would throw up water and tea for months afterwards, and never went back to being able to eat normally or exercise without significant pain. I then had a similarly awful experience being coerced into taking hormonal BC for my PCOS which actually made my PCOS much worse and induced massive weight gain, made me stop having periods for 2 years, etc. after only 3 months of taking it. TO THIS DAY every doctor I see tries to get me back on hormonal BC even though I am still trying to recover from the massive weight gain and menstrual issues it caused. After researching this I again found out that BC-induced PCOS is actually quite common, but no one tells doctors I guess. I have to fend off the BC recommendation literally any time I speak to my doctor.   </p>
<p>These (especially the anti-inflammatories) are things that require only cursory research/knowledge of drug interactions but most doctors don't give a shit honestly. They just want you in and out in fifteen minutes. Now as someone with a graduate education in the biosciences I get treated like the worst trash for walking into a doctor's office knowing more than the doctor knows about whatever condition/drug/etc. they are talking about and am seen as noncompliant but I can't afford to further screw over my health even one more time. I went from one of the healthiest people I have ever met to a chronically ill wreck almost entirely BECAUSE of medical "care."</p>

        <p>Your side is the side not capable of civil discourse. The pro vaccine extremism has reached a cult like fever pitch where your side calls people granny killers and Nazis for exercising autonomy over their own body.</p>
<p>"I took the vaccine and had no side effects. That’s the case for about 99.9% of people"</p>
<p>No, it isn't. But again, you're speaking to someone who had tendon ruptures from a "safe and effective" drug where tendon rupture allegedly occurred in 0.1% of cases. So no, I simply don't accept your numbers that you're getting from the same people selling the drug.</p>

        <p>I don't care that you're vaccinated, but your preening on about your heroism and bullying/manipulation of perceived second class citizens is highly offensive.</p>
<p>I am non-apologetic about telling you that what you're advocating for is medical fascism. Implying that I personally should get it, after suffering pharmaceutical induced PTSD, is borderline psychotic and probably makes you one of the most selfish people on the planet. But ironically you'd probably call me selfish. Irony is never lost on you pro vaccine extremists.</p>

        <p>Though I said nothing about forcing anyone, let alone you personally, to get a vaccine, you use buzz words like fascism, bullying, and manipulation to imply that I did. Then, you falsely accuse me of implying you should get it. I said I am unapologetic about telling people that not getting it can lead to more dying. If that makes you feel anything about it, good. But you feel that because killing someone through action, or inaction is bad and you know it. It's your choice. Do, or don't vaccinate, but own your choice and don't pretend that the effects of that choice are anyone else's fault. As for the ad hominem half of your comment, please feel free to berate me all you want if it makes you feel better. I don't do drama. I can't be goaded.</p>
