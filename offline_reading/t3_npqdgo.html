    <strong>I feel like a kid that Walked into the wrong class...</strong>
    <p><p>What in gods name is going on at this subreddit... People treating science like its a religion and that "believing in science" is a thing?? I come across so many God damn buzzwords I feel like I need An apiary suit Just to heg through.</p>
<p>Is this sub legit Just filled with people that dont want to stop a deadly desease that had killed millions at this point??? Who are you people, who raised you?! Have some God damn decensy and care about someone else for once. If you are told that doing something Will prevent people from dying or losing a loved one, then what kind of monster are you to spit in their face. Its not that fucking difficult. </p>
<p>Listen to the experts. They didn't spend 25% of their fucking life on university and phds Just for you to "do your own research". People are dying. 2020 was the worst year of many people alive today. And unless you want 2021 to be even worse start fucking acting like an adult and do something about it.</p>
<p>Shame on you all.</p></p>

        <p>I'm getting to the point where I'm not even sure "rent free" applies anymore.</p>
<p>For some of them sure, but for others I'm starting to wonder if cognitive dissonance isn't starting to build up and they don't know how to write the questions that their brain is forming.</p>
<p>And they know damn well that if they ask within their group, or ask us in a civilized manner, they'll get banned from their "support system".</p>

        <p>The experts haven't held a consistent opinion since the Spanish flu. First it's the Wuhan Coronavirus, now that's racist, first it's racist to assume it came out of the Wuhan Virology Lab, now it's mainstream to believe that. Masks don't work, now they do, oh but now you need several.</p>
<p>Lockdowns didn't work until they spontaneously did. A vaccine designed in 48 hours? Perfectly safe. Going to a ball game pre or post vaccine? Horrible evil devil work &rt;:(</p>

        <p>2020 was a great year for me. I got a promotion, got married (indoor venue, 100 people from multiple states, maskless) had a kickass honeymoon in Disney (no lines because people were terrified to go to the happiest place on earth),was able to travel all around the country for dirt cheap bc airlines were offering tickets at rock bottom prices to stay afloat. On top of it all, I saved so much money by not going to useless things like concerts, movies, and restaurants, that I was able to buy my dream car (95 wrangler.) I didn’t let anything stop me from what I wanted to do, mostly because people are pussies and don’t know how to deal with confrontation. All I ever got was dirty looks when I walked into a store breathing freely. I can tell you too, it was easy to get to the front of a line by fake coughing. Nobody I know died even though I know dozens of people that have gotten Rona (or at least they got a piece of paper that said they were positive).</p>

        <p>I mean I spent money on a wedding which allowed the venue employees to be paid (all the other weddings cancelled) then there was the photographer, the cake decorators, hotel staff, golf course that I had my bachelor party at. All got paid because of my business to them. Then there are the pilots, flight attendants, Disney staff and the people I bought the car from. I also work at a shipping company. So while everyone was locked down getting fat off soggy take out, I was delivering essential (and non-essential) goods. So, if you really look at it, I am a hero! Without people like me, even more jobs would have been lost. I’m just doing my part really because everyone else was too selfish to help support these businesses that desperately needed cash flow to keep from going under.</p>

        <p>So basically you are telling me that if I give you a list of doctors and researchers that show that the COVID vaccine is more harm than a cure you'll accept it? Please remember that as you wrote "They didn't spend 25% of their fucking life on university and phds Just for you to "do your own research"."</p>
<p>Because I can do that for you.</p>
<p>Or are you going to tell me that those experts are "quacks" and only the ones that follow the narrative are "the real experts"?</p>
<p>Can you explain to me why hydroxychloroquine was taken off the table as a treatment when it has a 75 year proven record for treating the exact symptoms of COVID, and medical experts where saying that they treated COVID using it at first, but were silenced?</p>
<p>Can you tell why they keep pushing a vaccine when it has real side-effects, including deaths, but ALL previous vaccine trials get removed after 5 major side effects, but this one for some reason gets pushed along with no issue?</p>
<p>Maybe I'm just a fool, and deluded not to trust Dr. Anthony Fauci when he has already proven that he is following his own agenda... Look into Dr. Fauci and his stance on AIDS in the 80s.</p>
<p>Maybe Dr. Peter McCullough has absolutely no clue what he is going on <a href="https://principia-scientific.com/top-covid-doc-peter-mccullough-these-jabs-are-killing-people/">about</a>...</p>
<p>Or just maybe, you have been treating these experts as gods and thinking that they just want the best for people. "Damn the cost!" Please come get the vaccine and you'll be entered to win $50 million in cash and prizes (paid for by your tax dollars instead of being used to save thousands of small businesses).</p>
<p>EDIT: Last one, can you explain why people who are getting the vaccine on some of these groups are being praised, but then when they start feeling like shit and get worried about side-effects are silenced in those same groups?</p>

        <p>&rt;Listen to the experts. They didn't spend 25% of their fucking life on university and phds Just for you to "do your own research".</p>
<p>Who do you think we research?
Its the PhDs, doctors, and experts who the legacy media ignore, censor, and denigrate.</p>
<p>If you can't see you are being fed a curated, monochrome, repetitive propaganda, that's on you.</p>
<p>There is no longer fair debate or investigative, sceptical journalism available on the primary public platform. </p>
<p>This is irrefutable. </p>
<p>Just look at:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the complete blackout on coverage of the freedom marches around the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The treatment of the Great Barrington Declaration and it's esteemed authors and signatories. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lack of attention the dozens of open letters by thousands of doctors and experts around the world to their governments decrying lockdowns for the past year. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many experienced virologist, immunologists, and doctors have warned about the vaccines. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't know shit about medicine or vaccines, or viruses. But I know something stinks, and it isn't this sub.</p>

        <p>That's a good question, this Will definitly chance over time tho. Right now, when not everyone that wants to be vaccinated is vaccinated, I dont think that it is justified completely to be scared of unvaxxed people. But as Times go on, and people actively choose not to be vaccinated, then i consider it a sign of disaproval. Which is kinda like denouncing someones Actions. Thanks for the honest question.</p>

        <p>Just my opinion, but maybe add the above as an edit to your original post.</p>
<p>It won't change anyone's mind, but you might get some real answers to your questions, and not just pushback.</p>
<p>If you look through this sub-reddit you'll notice that when people post something as "fact" there are a lot of folks asking for sources, and more info.</p>
<p>We aren't just blindly following a narrative. We want answers, and we don't just accept 2+2=5 because some expert or another tells us.</p>

        <p>To cite a quote:</p>
<p>"Talking with people helps against prejudice while talking about them promotes it."</p>
<p>Often things get represented as if there's only two views about them where one is supposed to be clearly right and the other is supposed to be clearly wrong.</p>
<p>In actuality there's almost as many perspectives on a subject-matter as there's people. Everyone has a slightly different perception of reality based on their very own past experiences and thoughts.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that helps to get away from thinking there's only right or wrong, truth or lie and other dichotomies.</p>
<p>To me my own experiences carry more weight than anything that anyone else tells me. Part of the reason is that I very often experienced that things others told me weren't like I was told when I actually witnessed them myself.</p>
<p>I am particularly skeptical if someone tells me that I must take their word for granted and not listen to what others have to say about it as well as that my own experience is meaningless in the grand scheme of things.</p>
<p>If they are so convinced about what they say, they surely wouldn't want to avoid questions and an open debate with those who doubt what they say.</p>
