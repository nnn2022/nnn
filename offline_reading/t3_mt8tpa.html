        <p>The only reason you should get a vaccine (not just a COVID vaccine) is because you believe that it would likely benefit you more than it would likely harm you.  If you're getting this vaccine primarily for anybody besides yourself, you're getting it for the wrong reasons.  I hope this isn't coming across as patronizing, but you have to look out for you.  Make yourself a priority.  Now if you do a bunch of research and decide you want the second dose, that's fine, but just make sure you're getting it because you think it will do more good than harm for you.</p>

        <p>The only advice is don't be pressured into taking it. If you've taken one, don't take anymore.</p>
<p>Watch and observe the next couple of years - the reasons will become obvious.</p>

        <p>Why do you think of this after it is too late? Before 2020, has your family never taught you to not give in to peer pressure and to not do anything you do not feel comfortable about?<br>
<a href="https://medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php?EVENTS=on&amp;PAGENO=3&amp;PERPAGE=100&amp;ESORT=AGE&amp;REVERSESORT=&amp;VAX=(COVID19)&amp;DIED=Yes">https://medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php?EVENTS=on&amp;PAGENO=3&amp;PERPAGE=100&amp;ESORT=AGE&amp;REVERSESORT=&amp;VAX=(COVID19)&amp;DIED=Yes</a><br>
Here's the database for all adverse reactions reported leading to death so far (US only). Some of them are really horrible. <br>
Those are only short-term damages. Nobody knows what happens long-term. <br>
Scientists and health professionals have warned about all kind of possible long-term effects of mRNA vaccines.  Especially when it comes to fertility. <br>
Also, long-term trials for other vaccines (HIV and dengue fever) sometimes showed that the vaccines actually made people more susceptible to the virus they were supposed to be vaccinated against, which looking at the data, also seems to be the case here.   </p>
<p>If you care about your health, I recommend not taking the second dose. But of course, it's up to you. I just ask you to really get informed instead of doing what other people tell you to do..</p>

        <p>I'm not getting it.  I don't know what the long term effects are.  It could be for most people they are nothing but I likely already got COVID and I see no reason not to trust my immune system. The vaccine was rushed for political and economic reasons and they could have easily overlooked more than just clotting.</p>

        <p>You need to keep getting the vaccines. Whatever you do, because you’ve already had the first dose, you need to keep getting them. Get the second dose, ASAP, and every booster following it. If you don’t,<a href="https://themostbeautifulworld.com/blog/vaccine-studies">you will be at a higher risk for serious illness if you’re exposed to a variant.</a> If you’re worried about the more nasty direct side effects of the vaccines—Bell’s palsy, liver damage, prion disease, blood clots, etc.—know that while these are underreported (this is normal for all vaccines—vaccine injuries in general go largely unreported), the risk of a cytokine storm from not continuing to get them is much, much higher, as is evidenced by the studies I linked.</p>
<p>Basically, the threat of COVID is now, for you, just as bad as, if not worse than, what the MSM is saying. You really stand a major chance of dying if you’re not extremely careful.</p>
<p>Please stay safe—don’t leave the house if you don’t have to, and wear an N95 or better, plus proper PPE, if you have to go among people. I know “stay safe” is such an irritating, canned thing to say, but unfortunately, it does apply now more than ever.</p>
<p>I’m really, really sorry I don’t have anything more positive to say about this. I suppose the one positive thing is that if the whole vaccine passport crapshow does go down, you might be able to help your unvaccinated peers.</p>

        <p>This is such a dangerous thing to say. Yes, damage has been done by already by taking it, but most people suffer severe adverse reactions or die after the second dose, not the first. A healthy body can take this gene therapy most of the time, but a second or third or any consecutive dose just makes it worse.</p>

        <p>I came to my conclusions based on the studies I linked. Could you please show me the evidence that the risk of serious complications after the second dose is higher than the risk of a cytokine storm on exposure to a variant, and that mRNA technology has been improved from the past in these vaccines such that a healthy person wouldn’t experience a cytokine storm on exposure to a variant after being vaccinated?</p>
