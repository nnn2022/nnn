        <p>Text on a white background is so easy to fake, any instance of that kind of image being used as evidence of anything should be thoroughly mocked.</p>

        <p>They're not fake, they're just from a time when we didn't know quite as much about the disease. Early 2020 there was a lot of uncertainty, and Fauci gets a lot of criticism for changing his stances, but he really mainly changes them when we learn new information. On an objective level, there's nothing wrong with changing your stance when new information comes out. The problem is that he was the primary source of information for a lot of people, and so a lot of people found his inconsistencies in what he says to be a bad thing, when really you can chalk it up to it being a novel virus we didn't know much about. I think Fauci was trying to prevent massive panic and there weren't really a lot of good options for him, but these people saying he's some sort of monster aren't correct. Anything he says will piss off conspiracy theorists. He's one of the most educated people in the world on diseases, respected by every president he worked for except Trump, he's not some wicked conspirator, he's just the face of a problem with no easy solution.</p>
