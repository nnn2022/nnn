    <strong>I would like to say something with absolu</strong>
    <p><p>Let me make one thing clear.</p>
<p>Both sides are completely different, but both sides act the same. Both sides believe each other are lunatics. Both sides make fun of each other. Both sides think the other lives in fear. One supposedly fears a virus, the other supposedly fears a mask. Both cannot be in unison. You can't support both sides. Sadly, like a lot of heavily debated things, it's one of those things where there is no inbetween.</p>
<p>I have seen some theories. I've tried to see things your way. Some of what you say makes sense, while some seems like logic was thrown out the window. You must feel the same way about us. Again, both sides cannot understand each other. </p>
<p>But I propose that instead of sticking to one belief, we be open minded. <strong>Both</strong> sides, us too. Sticking to one belief can often be unhealthy, as you could lose sight of what's important to protect your opinion. History has shown this concept thousands of times.</p>
<p>I understand how attached you are to your opinion. I'm sad to say that I will get comments thrashing this post, some not even reading the whole thing first. What I want everyone to do is judge their options more open mindedly.</p>
<p>In any debate, for fun or for glory, the best thing to do is try to understand both sides. You can't prove something by taking information from one source and ignoring everything else. Ignoring the other belief means that you are too protective and will do anything to preserve it, including being in a state of denial. Reminder: Both sides can become like this. A fact is something concrete and unarguable. Both sides can't claim a fact to be true or false depending on the belief. The only way for one person to check is to look at both sides and (fairly) judge using ethos, logos, and pathos (ethicality, logic, and empathy)</p>
<p>If you can actually read through multiple sources with multiple viewpoints and come up with your own view, then you've proven to be responsible. You can understand and respect both sides, but personally choose one.</p>
<p>If you downvote this comment in the sole intent that you disagree with my proposition, you've proven <br>
my point that you can't be responsible with your understanding. I've been gentle. I've been fair. I've seen what you have to say and I made my own decision based on evidence from both sides. I did not try to bash anyone or target or accuse any belief. It's okay if you disagree (within a certain limit) All I ask is that you do the same. That you be as fair.</p></p>
