        <p>But in that cute little ban wave they made their own safe spaces. Now they can circlejerk without ever having to hear an outside opinion. NNN is obviously super biased, but I've been a part of some great discussions on here with really intelligent people on both sides. Unfortunately intelligent conversation between citizens is the opposite of what those in power want</p>

        <p>I find that people routinely overlook that the 1st amendment only applies to the government restricting speech of individuals so the outrage about social media companies banning certain people or topics is completely misplaced. As long as the rules are clearly stated and applied equally no one's rights are being violated.</p>
<p>Imagine Twitter or Facebook or whatever platform being your own home. If you invite someone inside and they start saying things you don't like or don't want to hear you have every right to kick them out of your house and lock the door behind them.</p>

        <p>That works in theory, when the rules are equally applied. In practice, when the rules are applied to advance an agenda, and the platforms advancing that agenda have a near-monopoly, does your argument break down.</p>

        <p>Private companies are absolutely allowed to hold, advance, and support an agenda. If the market didn't agree with it the company would go out of business. There is a very legitimate concern about the monopolization of social media with Facebook being the biggest culprit but as it stands today they are operating within the rules.</p>

        <p>Well the German court doesn't seem to agree with that logic (<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/german-court-fines-youtube-24118000-for-removing-video-of-covid-19-protest/ar-AAM7GHf?ocid=BingNewsSearch">Newsweek</a>).</p>
<p>YouTube pulled a video of a German COVID protest under "misinformation" or something similar, the German court said nope and ordered YT to put it back up. YT didn't so now they've been fined.</p>
<p>I honestly doubt it will go anywhere, but your house example breaks down when the "House" is global, and the guests have different outlooks.</p>
<p>I'm waiting for the day one of the big social medias start blocking whole countries. I'll be curious of the fallout from that, if any.</p>

        <p>That would be their decision as a company - to determine if the losses from pulling out of a particular market was worth it compared to the chance of receiving fines or having to alter their operation. I'm not familiar enough with German law to know what YouTubes options are here but it sounds like they're ok with receiving fines in order to keep operating the way they prefer.</p>

        <p>I honestly understand the "Private Company" argument, but I wonder how far these companies can push it.</p>
<p>Yes it is a private company, but there hasn't been any companies like these ever before.</p>
<p>It falls into the realm of legal theory and paradigms but it is a "interesting" thought process.</p>
<p>And something you wrote in your previous reply "Private companies are absolutely allowed to hold, advance, and support an agenda." Is bull. </p>
<p>The biggest mistake in my opinion was the ruling that made corporations individual entities. Private companies can't think, which means it is the human being the "curtain" that has an agenda. If a magic wand changed the opinion of those that run the companies 180^(o) then the company would do a 180^(o).</p>

        <p>That’s a low intelligence metaphor. Facebook and Instagram aren’t somebody’s home. They are world altering platforms. They are incredibly influential in matters of public policy and opinion.</p>
<p>Imagine if Facebook and Instagram decided that you could only post anti Jewish things. It was fine to post stuff abou how many bankers are Jewish, and how Jews are the ones over represented at Harvard and Yale, not white people. And any counter arguments were banned. </p>
<p>Are you fine with that? Like, it’s Facebook, who cares right? Imagine 2,3,5 maybe 10 years of this. How do you think the public attitude towards Jews would be?? </p>
<p>Honestly, Facebook is more like the old town squares where people would debate. It’s massive.</p>

        <p>I have a strong feeling that if Facebook decided to shift to being exclusively anti-jewish the market would react by "cancelling" them through boycotts and mass abandonment of their platforms. There are plenty of alternate social media options that exist currently so one would rise to the top and fill the void, or a new one would be created as a near clone of the current Facebook experience but without the hypothetical anti-jewish stance you're proposing.</p>
<p>I didn't intend the house metaphor to be a perfect analogy to social media companies, it was meant to be a simple way to quickly explain how the 1st amendment applies to private companies.</p>

        <p>your sentiment is horribly misguided buddy. There is nothing morally problematic about what I'm saying at all. Think of children for example. Are children all lesser subhuman beings who deserve to die? Of course not. But should children yield to adults and have their upbringings dictated to them by adults? Absolutely yes without a doubt and it's not even confusing. That's what's happening here. If you say children should have the same autonomy as adults, you do not have any moral high ground of any kind. Rather, you are an enabler of harm and you are a villain.</p>

        <p>Honestly. Taking the moral high ground and losing is still losing. When you face a conflict in which your existence is at stake, you play to win. </p>

        <p>Nah, this is just behavioral sink. Been a problem since long before COVID and will be a problem long after. Hell, maybe some people here were the "sheep" last time around or will be next time around. To deny the autonomy of others because they give in to groupthink might only deny your own automomy.</p>

        <p>"I've got nothing to hide" is one of the most dangerous attitudes to have in an age where mass data collection can be used to control your decisions. This is not hypothetical or a conspiracy theory. this is a well known fact that organizations such as facebook have openly admitted to.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this kind of person is rife in Australia. Most Australians have no idea Australia does not have a bill of rights. They also have no concept of the importance of freedom and civil liberty. This, I believe, is due solely due to a lack of education. And I believe govts want it this way as it keeps the population from questioning their decisions.</p>

        <p>Really it's brilliant, how the system has made this into a "left" vs "right" thing. Disliking surveillance is right-wing and disliking police brutality is left-wing. Of course since you can't be both left and right, it follows that you can't be against both. Nobody will listen. Freedom for the sake of freedom is a foreign concept to this system. Yet everyone claims that their "side" is the guardian of freedom.</p>

        <p>To be fair I held a similar view at yours be point in my life. Until I realised that the people pulling the strings are willing and able to kill tens of thousands of innocent people. Now the thought of them having access to such information is more than frightening. Let's talk about putting in place proper checks and balances to ensure those in power can't abuse their position (whether of freewill or by force). Then maybe I'd be happy to talk about Orwellian monitoring of the general population.</p>

        <p>"Don't do the wrong thing, and they won't have a reason to. Simple."</p>
<p>The arrogance here is miraculous. "The wrong thing"? And who gets to decide what is right and wrong? As if this jackass holds some kind of moral high ground by supporting invasive government. </p>
<p>I think the only way to cure people of this kind of thinking is to subject them to the ultimate end of their own policies. </p>
<p>Then again, people like that never learn. They will bend over backwards and let government do whatever they want as long as they feel it will keep them safe.</p>
