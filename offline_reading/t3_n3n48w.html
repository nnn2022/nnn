    <strong>Are lockdowns and muzzles helping to reduce the number of deaths in Australia?</strong>
    <p><p>Where can I find some reliable statistics about all cause mortality? What kind o measures have been implemented in this last year?</p>
<p>I'm asking because I've heard things are like in Canada there: very draconian</p></p>

        <p>Unrelated but I’ve seen this from another concerned Australian. Not aimed at you I just copy pasted. </p>
<p>The dense network of police checkpoints enforcing travel restrictions is called the the "Ring Of Steel".</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/ck_bBbjWEiA https://youtu.be/zDZ8LqO7174</p>
<p>Here's the Melbourne (Victoria state capital) police chief talking about smashing windows and ripping people out of cars if they don't comply with covid-19 checkpoints</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/M3Pepw7RcMs</p>
<p>News report about a woman having her window smashed and being ripped out of her car.</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/PqicULWpIRw</p>
<p>Here's a video of a pregnant woman in Vic being arrested over a Facebook post</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/kR4rubpfhqc</p>
<p>In this video the aforementioned pregnant arrestee tells us she organized a protest because she is concerned about human rights, has lost her job and was tired of hearing about suicides. She then retracts her call to protest, stating that she is now too scared to do so.</p>

<p>Woman in Melbourne has child torn from her and is arrested for protesting lockdown restrictions</p>

<p>Here's a young girl in Melbourne getting choked out for not wearing a mask</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/dcitiQuSEJI</p>
<p>News report about Melbourne man arrested at his home over a Facebook post. The newscaster gloats about how the arrest victim "had a remarkable change of heart after police stormed his home".</p>

<p>Here you can see someone wrestled to the ground by multiple police officers at the beach for not showing ID. They check your address because you're not allowed to go more than 5 km from home. If you don't have ID they arrest you.</p>

<p>Here a female beachgoer is wrestled to the ground by police for not wearing a mask</p>

<p>Business owner visibly and audibly distraught as he expresses his frustration about Melbourne Premier Dan Andrews again postponing the end of lockdown restrictions which was supposed to take place this week.</p>

<p>So please tell me again how australia is the leading example of a rational pandemic response when the privilege to live life as normal was exchanged through removal of rights and freedoms</p>

<p>study shows death rates were influenced by factors like geography and elderly population (life expectancy) but NOT by stringency of Gov imposed measures https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2020.604339/full</p>

        <p>Thanks although It didn't answer my question, It actually helps to show the fascist measures that are implemented in the name of the 'rona religion</p>

        <p>The Rona is fake. It is a PSYOP. It is just flu/pneumonia/ stroke/ cancer and other deaths being listed as the Rona. This is the only thing you need to know</p>

        <p>First hand experience, Covid has been exterminated in Australia, except in the quarantine hotels and the occasional leak from there (case of a hotel cleaner getting infected and taking it home, etc.) </p>
<p>Interstate travel has no restrictions, there are no mandatory mask rules and the only Covid measure is a QR checkin app when visiting gyms and restaurants for contact tracing. </p>
<p>Lockdowns worked here.</p>
