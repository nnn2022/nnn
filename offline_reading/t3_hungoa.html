    <strong>People working remote for the first time need to plan accordingly</strong>
    <p><p>If you’re one of the “lucky” people that were able to start working remote for the first time ever during this crisis you need to consider the following and plan accordingly:</p>
<p>If your job figured out how to make your position remote, what makes you think they need YOU to do it?</p>
<p>Now that you’ve proven it can work, they can hire someone international to do your job. If for some reason your job is protected from offshoring, then why would they possibly continue to pay you at the (<strong><em>_insert big city</em></strong>_) rate, when they can hire someone in a small rural town to do it for 40%+ less?</p>
<p>If you’re working remote for the first time, you need to figure out how to restructure your living expenses immediately so you can remain economically relevant when an employer decides to cut your pay or replace you.</p></p>

        <p>Counter point: I’ve been remote for 2 years. They aren’t offshoring my job because they tried that and the work done abroad was below sub-par. It was so bad, it was unsustainable. Customers flocked from the company because service and support was so bad. They had to bring a ton of shit back. I don’t doubt that some companies without the experience of this happening will try it. It doesn’t tend to last long when companies try it. Considering that many of the countries that are typically used for outsourcing are doing worse than us currently, I don’t think it’s as pressing as it seems. The exodus in 2008-2009 showed people the downsides of outsourcing.</p>

        <p>Up til now I'd have agreed. Have WFH for years as well for a major national telco and they have been ramping up the offshoring, and they have finally come for our team. It always felt like a "safe" place to be working in terms of job security, but I'll soon be unemployed.  I will still look to WFH for whatever the next thing will be - but either way, the concern of people getting screwed throughout a paradigm shift towards WFH is definitely legitimate IMO.</p>
<p>I'm definitely for WFH, but it needs to be done in such a way that limits the fallout. People aren't suddenly worth less if they work from home - but it can't be denied that companies <em>will</em> take advantage of the "opportunity" to lower their costs. Many will pay the price for their short sighted implementations, but it won't stop them from trying.</p>

        <p>My company has a lot of experience in offshoring.  What they've found is that they need a mix:  some of the tasks can be done in developing countries at the lower rate, but some of them cannot.  This is true even for jobs that are similar (same group but different levels of seniority).  In general, the more seniority, the less likely the job can be off-shored.  </p>
<p>That doesn't mean I'm feeling smug and secure tho.</p>

        <p>Conversely... if you do live in a city for a job now may be the time to move out to where the living is cheaper.</p>
<p>I'm thankful because my job is a) tied to the construction industry and I have to be able to visit job sites and b) I'm proficient in a design software that few people in my industry know how to use, even though it became the standard years ago.</p>

        <p>I’d be more concerned about moving jobs to cheaper Us cities than total offshoring. Somethings can be done abroad well and some things not. Loving a job from NYC to Alabama is still a massive savings for a company. </p>
<p>The issue is that people who are high performers generally want to live in a cool place (NY) or a place with amenities (CA). They could find someone in Mobile to be the head designer for Calvin Klein but not sure how the results will be.</p>
