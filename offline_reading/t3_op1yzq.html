    <p><p>The language they're using to describe half of America is just as anger and fear inducing as the language they used leading up to the "war on terror".</p>
<p>Make no mistake, they have no intention of treating the "deplorables" any better then they treated the "terrorist".</p>
<p>They're explaining what they are planning to do in the words they use to describe you and your actions. </p>
<p>There's no form of resistance that won't be labeled sedition/insurgency/terrorism. As soon as those labels start being used, don't expect your rights as a citizen to protect you. </p>
<p>The last time I heard powerful people talk like this, they were explaining why I was justified in killing people after we invaded their country. The woke take over of military is going to take care of the problem of a military that's loyal to the constitution, we are running out of time. </p>
<p>-just an opinion of a veteran of murdering people with the justification of labels.</p></p>

        <p>Can’t watch the news anymore. The open and outright lies they spew. Example. On vacation my mother in law had the news on. They were talking about Trump comparing him to Hitler. They said the Nazis took over Germany. Not true. The Nazis were elected. They were voted in. They didn’t take over anything. I had to turn the lie box off. By the way, why are they still talking about Donald Trump?  He’s no longer president. Yet every day they talk about him.</p>

        <p>Yeah, the people cheering this on apparently don't have the foresight to realize there's no legal difference in a "white supremacist" and anyone else. They are claiming the right to do whatever they want to whoever they want,  with nothing but the warrant of an accusation of an ideology. </p>
<p>Just imaging all the Marxists who will be screaming "BUT I'M NOT A WHITE SUPREMACIST!!" as they're being dragged out of their house by the feds...</p>
<p>Telling a few million people "I told you so" is all I have to look forward to. lol</p>

        <p>They tried to remove the establishment from power. The elites are trying to send a message that it won't be permitted ever again.</p>
<p>Same goes for the far-left too, by the way. If a popular far left wing candidate tries to come to power and overthrow the elites and the Washington establishment....he and his supporters will get the Donald Trump treatment.</p>
<p>They are calling it an "insurrection" because to them it was. If these elitists are not in power, they consider it a revolt. They will fight anyone who threatens the status quo and anyone who threatens the Washington machine. </p>
<p>And the mainstream media is the propaganda arm. Over 90% of the news media in the United States is run by 6 corporations. They all support the establishment.</p>
