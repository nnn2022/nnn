        <p>The complaint is Kraken-level bonkers.</p>
<p>There's definitely a question to be asked how the affiant got the CMS data (especially if she actually cross-referenced to vaccination date data) which actually might be a legitimate HIPAA violation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://teakrulos.com/2020/07/">“Alien DNA” is being used in today’s medical field.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dr. Immanuel teaches in her seminars that miscarriages and medical issues like infertility, impotence, and cysts, are a result of “astral sex” from “spirit husbands (or incubus)” or “spirit wives (or succubus),” which are sex demons that seduce you with their powers and bang you in a “sleep world.” Immanuel says that cysts and fibroid tumors are a result of demon sperm, which can also impregnate you to create li’l demons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reptilians or “lizard people” (a group of sinister extra-terrestrials) have infiltrated our government disguised as humans. Please see a chapter of my new book American Madness titled “Reptoid Royalty.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dr. Immanuel says that vaccines are a secret plot to microchip people.
Also, that the government is developing a vaccine to prevent people from “becoming religious.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She asserts Dr. Fauci and CNN (the whole organization?) are secretly taking hydroxychloroquine and she has challenged them to deliver urine samples to her to analyze if they dispute her claim.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Bonkers.</p>

        <p>Officials can verify easily what she is reportjng.   If true extremely alarming. Maybe she reported it to her superior and wanted to escalate it and maybe they didn't want to escalate it within the workplace. Maybe she was forced to escalate it elsewhere. </p>
<p>Noticing how many VAERS reports that exist versus how many total cases that pull up in a separate report exist and seeing the different numbers that are staring you in the face is a not necessarily a HIPPA violation.</p>
<p>Nowhere in the preliminary injunction did it say that she was trying to match up patient data on the VAERs report.</p>
<p>My interpretation of section d is: she ran a report with specified field only looking at certain criteria and it pulled a particular number and then looking at the public data that is released in VAERs and seeing the numbers not equaling each other. </p>
<p>The problem with the VAERs is that it is truly the patient or their next of kin's responsibility to make a report it's rare that health professionals will do so.  People cannot self-report deaths once they're dead. </p>
<p>The Medicare Medicaid database is probably a very good sample size of deaths status post x number of days since vaccination. </p>
<p>Hell it might even be an easy report to run I don't know. It could be running a report of Medicaid patients or Medicare patients that have died in the last 30 days. It could be adding a filter to filter out the patients that are in the state's database as having a recent vaccination. It could also have another filter of the type of vaccination. And then it's only looking at the date range at that point. Could be a very simple report I have no idea. </p>
<p>As for Dr Immanuel, she is not personally listed on the preliminary injunction or anywhere in the preliminary injunction. The group is much larger than just her and it would be wrong to judge this injunction based on one person's alleged history. I'm not sure why you're calling her out except to just get people to go oh that person and not pay attention to anything within the preliminary injection.</p>

        <p>These are real doctors, just like Powell, Giuliana and Dershowitz are real lawyers. </p>
<p>The professional boards in charge of these people need a total revamp. </p>
<p>Demon Semen just happens to be at the forefront of lunacy.</p>
<p>In the Jane Doe affidavit, it discusses searching CMS data for vaccine and death dates and drawing a correlation between them. Depending on what databases were accessed, her job, etc., accessing those medical record databases may have been a HIPAA violation.</p>
<p><a href="https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2021/02/notice_of_privacy_practices_acknowledgement.pdf">If she revealed information from this system without permission, it is probably a HIPAA violation.</a></p>
<p>They're saying the vaccine isn't necessary because hydrochloroquine and azithromycin are more than effective treatments. (p21)</p>
<p>Demonstrably there is a lack of understanding regarding correlation and causation.</p>
<p>&rt;Despite the misinformation being disseminated in the press – and, at times, by the Defendants – there are numerous alternative safe and effective treatments for COVID-19. Globally and in the United States, treatments such as Ivermectin, Budesonide &amp; Dexamethasone, convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibodies, Vitamin D, Zinc, and Azithromycin are being used to great effect.</p>
<p>These substances are used for treating the secondary pulmonary infections that result, but that's after someone's been infected/hospitalized. It's like saying:
&rt;"Why should soldiers wear bulletproof vests? Tourniquets work great!"</p>

        <p>From my understanding when people are hospitalized they aren't really giving any treatment until they get to the point where they need a ventilator. A relative of mine was hospitalized and basically given IV fluids until they could be discharged.</p>
