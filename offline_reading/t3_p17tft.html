    <strong>How did we get here? Where does this all go?</strong>
    <p><p>I've arrived at a place where if I don't join the largest human experiment of all time I will not graduate college. The hate, dismissal, and vitriol I see for anyone who questions the smallest bit about "it" or the mandates is genuinely astounding. I see these protests around the world but sometimes it feels like I'm the only person who does not want this, to the point that I wonder if I'm making a huge deal out of nothing or genuinely stupid or something. How much of it is the media?  It seems like anyone against it will soon be left behind as the near entirety of the world steams on, ignoring any and all real science, dissent, etc. Are people really towing the mainstream narrative like never before? I feel like if trusting the mainstream was a stock it would be doing amazon numbers. How can we all be so blind and non-skeptical? When did critical thinking become nearly illegal? How can we continue to mandate this thing that even the mainstream itself is starting to admit is not working? Will this calm down or only escalate? What will the rest of the year hold? What is the climax of this narrative?</p></p>

        <p>That's up to you. It's up to all of us. Do we want to finish college, get a fake education and "enrich" ourselves pretending it was not by abandoning our humanity?</p>
<p>We own nothing when we have no freedom.</p>

        <p>If I can't get an exemption I'm about 80% sure I will drop out. The way things are going its starting to feel like a "which side of history will you be on" kind of situation. . It just pains me, I'm 9 months from graduating.</p>

        <p>You learned the truth. That's the real graduation one can hope for.</p>
<p>It's a real education. I guess I'd try a religious exemption, though. The Covidian cult is a religion at this point and I will not be a part of it.</p>
<p>That said, who knows what the world will look like 9 months from now, anyway.</p>

        <p>Try it. We cannot force them to speak the truth but we can force them to lie even more foolishly. You have drawn your line, they have drawn theirs.</p>
<p>Science is not scientism. We can prove this any day. If they refuse to debate and come to hammer us down, it's on them.</p>
<p>The time to run for the hills has not yet come. We must all stand and oppose this tyranny. If nothing else, history will judge us kindly. You're on the hero's journey now. May it lead you to a good life.</p>

        <p>As far as college goes, it’s not worth dying or being maimed for. Wait this out. As far as critical thinking (which is why you go to college) you’ve already got that down. Any college and employer would be lucky to have you.</p>
