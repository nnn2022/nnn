        <p>&rt;“Ninety-one percent of Americans have heard of the pause, showing a clear breakthrough of the issue in our collective consciousness in a very short period of time,” <strong>the poll</strong> reported on Tuesday. </p>
<p>A poll reported.  Then by this gem of Media disinformation and spin:</p>
<p>&rt;In other words, no one can blame responsible health-care officials for residual, militant vaccine hesitancy.  The number of those who do not want the vaccine (roughly 20 percent) has been immovable since January, suggesting these people — which includes as much as 40 percent of Republicans — are impervious to reason and facts.</p>
<p>Let's just review what happened here.</p>
<p>She took a poll, and is now claiming this poll as "fact".  Then she says people who disagree with this <em>poll</em> are impervious to "reason" and facts".   Even though the fact, is she just presented a <em>poll</em>, and tried to pawn that off as "fact".  </p>
<p>The Media has become extremely dishonest, and this is another great example.</p>
<p>Democracy dies in darkness is right.  It dies with the Washington Post, which has become a pathetic embarrassment to itself.</p>

        <p>Jennifer Rubin is a complete psychopath. This is the same woman who has said almost all Trump voters should either be interned or shunned from society. But of course the Washington Post claims she’s their token “conservative.”</p>

        <p>There is so much wrong in that article, it's amazing.</p>
<p>"once fully vaccinated, you have near 100 percent immunity"  Really?</p>
<p>"only the willfully ignorant and destructive will remain unvaccinated."   The mrna shots seem pretty darn destructive to me.</p>
<p>" a constant flow of indisputable medical evidence"  You mean, propoganda that is constantly disputed by thousands of medical professionals?</p>
<p>"these people are impervious to reason and facts."  No, I just look at ALL the facts, and come to different conclusions.  </p>
<p>I'm sure at some point these lovely caring people will have no problem putting me in prison or out-right murdering me for the good of humanity.</p>

<p>Degree
Reporters are required to possess a high school diploma, and most reporters have at least a bachelor's degree. Typically, the degree should be in journalism, communications or a related media writing discipline. As a rule, a four-year degree in communications or English is admissible for those who have gathered freelance reporting experience within the industry. Many college journalism programs instruct students on how to conduct research, organize facts and present stories in a sensible, objective and appropriate manner. Preliminary courses in broadcast and print journalism expose reporters to numerous types of media communications before they commit to a specialization.</p>

        <p>We've known the media opinion is like this.  Nothing can actually take hold until these things get FDA approval.  Even places that "require" vaccines have to allow exemptions for certain cases.</p>
<p>This is more media saber rattling, and look at the source.  You can tell just from the expression on this journalists face that they don't believe their shit stinks.  Hell, they themselves probably haven't received the vaccine and are lying about it.</p>

<p>I am never taking this shot. If you want to exclude me from society, fine. I've already done without concerts, traveling, bars, and certain restaurants for a year. I don't want to be socially distanced and masked at a concert anyway like these clowns clamor for.</p>

        <p>&rt; Nonsense, look at these slippery slope exceptions we got through normalizing tyranny! See this proves you have to do it!</p>
<p>Reminder to never appease these people and never compromise on your principles. Anyone that espouses the centrist idea of compromise is the worst kind of subversive insect that needs to be squashed. If you compromise on foundational principles then you have nothing which is why you are in the state you are now because you let these insane people get their foot through the door and in return they bash your skulls with it. Vote your RINOs out, get rid of your Mitch McConnells, and replace them with uncompromising liberty minded militant fanatics. If your representatives aren't going to work with an armory strapped to their waists then they're lightweights.</p>

        <p>While I don't dispute the scientific underpinnings the author uses, I think she misses one very big problem: some people cannot get any of the available vaccines due to severe allergies, for example, which would cause them to die. Is she willing to tell them "You cannot participate in modern society"? I'm not.</p>
