    <strong>My son’s teacher at his school told his class that they need to sneeze into their masks</strong>
    <p><p>I am LIVID about this. I honestly was fine with the mask requirements in schools, even if I know they don’t work or even matter at this point, but I was just happy to get him back in school. But my son informed me today that his teacher, after a classmate pulled down his mask and sneezed into his elbow (you know, like we have always been told to do), his teacher flipped out and said, “do NOT take the mask down to sneeze! You have to keep your mask on when you sneeze.” </p>
<p>To be fair, I am so grateful that my son can go to school every single day and, for the most part, be normal. But even my son, who is more ok with following the rules than myself, was horrified by this, because he is the kind of kid who doesn’t like to get dirty.</p>
<p>Sneezing into your mask is insanity. You can argue that masks keep disease from spreading, but why the heck would you force a kid to sit with their own fluids covering their face? Isn’t that inherently unsanitary?? I see my kids come home from school and they are FILTHY by the end of the day. I’m really not ok with my son being forced to strap what amounts to a dirty tissue to his face all day. </p>
<p>I would be fine with this mask stupidity if it made sense. The kids are allowed to pull down their masks to eat. But they absolutely should be told to sneeze into a fucking tissue or, if unavailable, their elbow. Have them use sanitizer if you’re worried about them spreading shit — but having them sneeze into their fucking masks is the height of stupidity and idiocy.</p></p>

        <p>To be fair, you should sneeze into your mask. That’s what we do during surgery. That’s literally what the mask is for. To block droplets. </p>
<p>The real issue is:</p>
<p>Children should not be wearing masks in school, period. They don’t know how to wear them properly and they aren’t at risk. They are not vectors. They are human beings. They only get one chance to develop socially and intellectually. This is incredibly harmful. And it’s doing absolutely nothing to slow the spread.</p>

        <p>That’s interesting, I didn’t even think about that — so if you sneeze during surgery, you are forced to finish the surgery with boogers all over your face?</p>
<p>And honestly, you’re right, they shouldn’t. I do hope that the school is going to try to move away from masks eventually, especially because the principal did express to me that he is disturbed that teachers are using the mask rule as a tool to abuse the kids because of their irrational fear, and it bothers him.</p>

        <p>Ya you just step back from the patient with your head in the neutral position and sneeze. If you literally had snot running down your face you could break scrub but that rarely happens.</p>

        <p>Ahh ok that makes sense, but it’s still so gross. I guess if you’re going to medical school, bodily fluids, especially your own, dont disgust you nearly as much as they do the average person who grew up with relative cleanliness. And you’ve been trained for years. My son is 9 so it’s ridiculous to expect him to be able to do the same as a surgeon.</p>

        <p>What's even more dumb are the people who wear masks while working out. I don't imagine a sweat drenched mask is going to save you or others from the foul pestilence. Bonus points if it's the shitty surgical masks that people hang up on their rear view mirrors or stuff in the glovebox.</p>

        <p>At least sneezing hasn't been deemed to be biological terrorism.  Yet.</p>
<p>I would be livid too.  All these years we've been told to sneeze into our inner arms but now that's wrong?  No, what's wrong is telling a child to sneeze into his or her mask.  And mask wearing people get angry when some call masks "face diapers", a term I have never used before my next sentence...  That teacher essentially told that child he should soil his face diaper and continue wearing it. I hope the child's parents gave the school hell for that.</p>

        <p>Don’t worry, I spoke to the principal, who happens to be super normal. He was also horrified, but said that the only way he could tell the teachers to stop doing that was to have one of the doctors on his medical task force team say that it would be bad to do so. He said he would talk to them and find out what teachers should do in that situation.</p>

        <p>Good.  Don't you think that at minimum having tissues for them to sneeze into and then disposing the tissue would be far better than wearing a sneezed in and possibly mucus filled mask after that?  I would be horrified if that happened to my child, and furious.</p>

        <p>Agree. I have a 2 year old and another on the way. I don’t ever want to force masks on them. I hope they will be able to live somewhat normal lives without them but the older they get the less places they’ll be able to go without wearing one.</p>

        <p>Oh and also, I spoke to a teacher about this and she said, “well the kid can go to the school office and get a new mask (because they have those disposable ones to give out if a student needs one).” And all I could think was “but that kid then would have to keep the snot sitting against their face until they’ve managed to walk all the way to the office to retrieve a new one since they wouldn’t be allowed to take it off their face on the way down there.” Like ewww, I got nauseous just thinking about it.</p>

        <p>I get your reaction.  It seems nasty.  But think of it this way.  That snot was IN his body, it's not doing any real harm (other than aesthetic) on his face. </p>
<p>But others here are right.  Into the mask is the way to go to reduce transmission.  Is there something inherently less gross about snot on your sleeve?</p>

        <p>Yeah but that’s the thing — the school encourages the kids to wear masks with colorful designs and patterns, to make it cute and fun. And it does actually make it easier for kids to wear their mask. And now that they’ve sneezed (by no choice of their own), they have to run to the school office and get an ugly surgical mask. It’s embarrassing for them.</p>

        <p>That is the most asinine thing I’ve ever heard. I’m not “normalizing” it — I complained, LOUDLY. I emailed the entirety of the school administration, and the principal agreed with me and spoke to the teacher in question. Apparently, they are looking to have their medical experts come out and say that kids should sneeze in tissues because it would be unsanitary otherwise.</p>
<p>Homeschool is absolutely not for everyone. And it’s very important for my son to go to school and see his friends. Just because it’s a solution that works for you doesn’t mean it works for everyone. I’m doing my part by complaining and making noise.</p>

        <p>Look I am on your "team" with this but that's literally what the masks are for. I think it's stupid the kids have to wear them if they're healthy but if you're sick and sneezing then yeah, do it into the mask to minimize the drops going everywhere.</p>
<p>My whole family is just getting over a cold and my youngest still has this lingering cough and snot all over his face half the time. For now I'm actually having him wear a mask out in public out of courtesy. No one healthy needs one but if you're spewing phlegm from your face then do it into the mask for God sake. And I'm not condoning universal masking or even masks when sick beyond all this, but for now with everyone on edge, it's fine.</p>
<p>My kid who goes to school keeps a few masks in her backpack to switch out if they're dirty. Just pack more than one.</p>

        <p>People don’t just sneeze if they are sick, though. I sneeze if I walk outside sometimes. This was not a kid who had a cold or who was sick in the slightest. He simply sneezed — an involuntary action. And no it’s not what masks are for — that’s what tissues are for.</p>
