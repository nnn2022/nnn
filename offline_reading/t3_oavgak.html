    <strong>This pandemic has left me frustrated even with restrictions lifting</strong>
    <p><p>I feel like I should be over joyed that I can do things again without being told to put a mask over my face. Or that I can visit my friends and family that wasn't in my "bubble". I can make improvements in my life that would help me grow. Thing is all what I have been feeling lately is either anger, upset or nothing.   </p>
<p>There's so many things running through my mind that's just been over loading me. I've always struggled with weight, but it got worse during the pandemic. Though on top of having to focus on that I also have to deal with a career change. Which I already had changed once from wanting to cook to becoming an office assistant. Then the pandemic made me have to rethink things AGAIN for the third bloody time. While I feel like I got ahead early on in life I now feel behind. Especially now that with everything getting more expensive I can't work a minimum wage job and expect to make a living with that. Sure having to get a new job will increase my income, but after having to change multiple careers it really weighs down on you. The thoughts of not knowing what you want to do on top of now being fearful if that career or business can be sustained if another pandemic hits. It's sad all what it takes is for the government to add restrictions and not only does it hurt businesses, but it can completely put them out of business.  </p>
<p>On top of being frustrated dealing with the career and weight I also couldn't do anything to just try to have fun. Everything was either closed or restricted. I live in a household where everyone was worried about it and that didn't help. They even brought up the delta variant and I literally just told them "omg stop I don't want to hear it". It just feels like so much time was lost from not being able to enjoy it, that it feels like I can't enjoy it even with things reopened. Perhaps it's because I realize I have to many problems already that because of those I can't just go out and have a good time anymore. I wake up every morning with no motivation to tackle any of it because I feel like I just stopped caring. It's like with everything that's happened it caused my mental health to overload in a sense. You know give it to much shit to worry about and it just fry's you. Leaves you to stop caring about it all and the only reason you're staying alive right now is for your friends and family.</p></p>

        <p>I feel you. I’m really happy that things have gotten better but I just feel like I’m not the same person I was before, and I probably never will be again.</p>
<p>I used to be carefree. I was the perpetual optimist who always thought everything would be ok. I am not that way anymore. I feel like a part of my soul was stolen from me. I just teared up typing this.</p>
<p>Now, I’ve lost all respect for and faith in institutions I used to at least somewhat trust, and people in general. I can’t believe how many people I used to respect not only went along with it but participated in bullying and shaming on social media and in real life. This last year has been traumatizing. Not just covid but other reasons too.</p>
<p>I also have this lingering anxiety that they could do it again, and the brainwashed masses would just accept it. I really hope not but who the fuck knows anymore.</p>
