    <strong>Is building a natural immunity to covid frowned upon? If so, why?</strong>
    <p><p>I've had a case of fever/numonia and still rucked 8 miles with 150 pounds on my back at about 4am.</p>
<p>While fighting the ailment I had to take and passed a practice physical fitness test later in the day. About high noon at the hottest point of the day.</p>
<p>After all that I was still tasked to complete various paperwork and mentally strenuous tasks. </p>
<p>The symptoms made it so I could barely breath so I would breath through my mouth as inconspicuously as I could, my body was on fire, joints felt like they were broken and aching at all times, and my sense of balance and spacial recognition was a joke. I threw up while running on a few occasions but pressed forward cause honestly we do what we gotta do at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Durring all of this id often take pain killers, chugged gallons of water constantly and in my free time would forcibly sweated and work out in an attempt to burn out whatever had gotten me sick. </p>
<p>I looked like shit. A fricking zombie but was able to preform, though  below my average work output. </p>
<p>I honestly thought I was gonna die some nights as I'd wake up shocked that I couldn't breath at all and would have to calm myself so I could clear my airways and take deep slow breaths to get the oxygen flowing again. To me it just seemed like my body was deteriorating. </p>
<p>I barely got sleep while I was sick and it lasted about 2 weeks. It was fortunate that the symptoms were dying down slowly as I continued to push myself, practice mindful and efficient breathing when involving in physical exertion, and hydrated like no tomorrow. </p>
<p>After that had passed it would be over a year and a half before I'd get sick with a fever or cold again. Even in close quarter environments that housed others that were sick. </p>
<p>I always joked and said that I didn't get sick easily cause I buffed my immune system after ome sort of super virus and now everything else cant stand a chance. </p>
<p>I have friends with asthma that can't risk getting numonia. 
Whenever someone gets sick we usually keep away from those friends to make sure they don't catch whatever we have when we get it. </p>
<p>So I understand the need for keeping people that cant handle certain viruses due to preexisting conditions safe by avoiding them whenever we're ill. But we don't avoid them 24/7 and I think that's a good thing. </p>
<p>Mingling with others helps boost immune systems to a lesser and slower extent than just getting a virus and fighting it at full force. </p>
<p>At least that's how I've understood these things for years. It's the reason why when moving into a different area or country I eat fruit and honey that was locally grown there.</p>
<p>It boosts my immune system and keeps me from suffering the from allergies. </p>
<p>Is there something about covid that makes it an inopportune candidate for natural immunity?</p></p>

        <p>There's no profit in natural immunity.  That's it.  In every other way it provides better, broader, longer lasting resistance to disease.  As long as you're healthy enough to survive the disease (and the CFR for the delta variant is 0.1-0.2%, the IFR much lower, per UK docs) the natural immunity is preferable in every way, and less damaging than the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Follow the money.  I brought up natural immunity to a ROOM FULL OF DOCTORS and all of them looked like I said I was going to blow up the building.  They had no clue that was even a possibility to obtain.  One of them said every death from the vaccine was "worth it" to save the planet.  </p>

        <p>People really do trust doctors as if they were priests, when in fact they are glorified drug dealers.  </p>
<p>People don't realize the cult level indoctrination that these people go through in medical school - their dogmatic principles are not to be questioned!  That includes any skepticism regarding all vaccines.  They are not medicine, they are the holy sacrament of vaccinatation.</p>

        <p>What's interesting is that most doctors have NO CLUE what vaccines do or even what side effects are.  They don't know because they don't research on their own.  They parrot what they are told and that's it.  So when people question them, they are ostracized for questioning a doctor but I think we should question EVERYTHING.</p>

<p>“It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.”</p>
<p>― Upton Sinclair</p>
<p>It's that simple.  If they stick their neck out, they get hanged for it.  If they keep their head in the sand, they get free lunches, kickbacks, bonuses for high compliance among their patients, and invited to speak for fees as "thought leaders".   You can read that last term as "Kool-aid salesmen."</p>

<p>That's not following the science.  That's following the money, which is both a nice bribe, and an offer they must not refuse.  Can everyone else not see the parallels between Big Pharma and organized crime?  They've bought the media, who play their ads ad nauseum and pander to them with their news content.  They've captured their own regulatory agencies, which now do the bidding of Pharma instead of constrain what Pharma is able to do.  And they hold hostage the medical schools and doctors, forcing them to teach new doctors the vaccine dogma, and punish licensed doctors who dare to go against it.  It's Goodfellas on steroids.</p>

        <p>This. Immunity to the last SARS has been shown to still be present 17+ years later- but no one can profit off of that. The vaccine makers are raking in the MOST money ever off of a product with zero liability in the history of the world right now and they can continue to afford to buy off every politician/ celebrity and advertise non stop to continue raking it in.</p>

<p>Yeah!</p>
<p>Natural immunity is in competition with vaccine immunity.  There is no marketing campaign or profit to be made from natural immunity.  Billions of dollars are being spent on advertising, in order to make hundreds of billions of dollars in profits, from selling the vaccines.  Mother nature has not engaged in a counter-campaign.  It's just that simple.</p>
