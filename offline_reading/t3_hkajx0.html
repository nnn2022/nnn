    <strong>So much for my family's plan to visit Hawaii this coming year... bill HB2502 SD1 is being rammed through in Hawaii</strong>
    <p><p>I didn't see this bill being shared here so here's a link to the IG account Hawaii for Informed Consent sharing the latest details.  </p>
<p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CCJ9B9ejSVA/</p>
<p>I submitted testimony because it also affects visitors (international or not... I don't get how that's even legal but it doesn't even matter apparently).  </p>
<p>Feel free to read the wording of this bill because it sets the table now for other bills.  This passed the Senate WAM committee and now it going to vote on Monday even though this last round got 3200 testimonies with only 10 supporting the bill.</p>
<p>This bill gives unprecedented powers to the DOH that normally are given to an elected official, the governor.  Also has extremely vague wording around what they can do to you if you visit, test positive and not only that they word specifically to say this will be at your expense as well.  </p>
<p>Here is another summary post of the bill:

<p>Another post about the bill:
https://www.instagram.com/p/CCEnZJKDl0A/</p>
<p>Wish I had better news but I feel like these people do not care about our rights to choose for our own bodies what is right for us.</p>
<p>I have eczema and supposedly it is an autoimmune condition but I've been healing it using cleansing techniques for the past 2 years.  I got eczema starting in college when I worked in a lab testing pesticides on insects.  If they had their way with me they'd put me on a steroid which from what I've seen from other people who have shared their stories eventually causes the eczema to explode and the steroids stop working over time anyhow.</p>
<p>Please share this information.  This bill needs to be made public so the people know what is coming!</p></p>

        <p>Oh jesus. I was wondering how Hawaii was doing considering their insane state government and the fact that almost their whole economy is tourism based. That's really f***ed. The locals are gonna be among the most screwed in the nation if they try to make it impossible to attract tourists.</p>

        <p>It really feels deliberate, doesn't it?</p>
<p>I mean, I know people want to think politicians are just idiots (and to an extent, I think they <em>are</em>) but this feels like an intentional crash of their economy.</p>

        <p>Yes I also feel this is deliberate.  I've been following the Mauna Kea protests and this bill will essentially make protesting almost impossible at this point given the wording because they explicitly include interisland travel as well.</p>
<p>:( I'm really sad for the natives in Hawaii because they do depend so heavily on the tourism industry for their livelihood and they already have had to fight so hard already.  They kicked Monsanto/Roundup out only to have the federal courts overrule them.</p>

&rt;The screening may apply to any and all travelers, including interisland, domestic, and international travelers, and it may apply to both arrival and departure points within the State of Hawaii.  Benefits include the determination of whether quarantine or isolation is necessary for the wellbeing of the public, including travelers, travelers' households, and traveling companions, as well as the opportunity for timely treatment to prevent or lessen symptoms or to shorten the duration of the disease.  To further enhance the effectiveness of the screening process, and from experience, we also find it necessary to establish penalties to address individuals who are uncooperative or seek to evade the screening process.  This screening process will also authorize the department of health to take certain actions upon completion of traveler screening, including testing, investigating, monitoring, quarantining, and isolating travelers, as determined necessary by the director of health to protect the public health and safety.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;     This Act also amends existing law to work more efficiently in conjunction with any emergency proclamation issued to respond to the spread of a communicable or dangerous disease and gives the director of health authority to declare a public health emergency if there is, or there is a potential for, an epidemic or serious outbreak of communicable or dangerous disease.</p>
<p>So if someone's kid gets cryptosporidiosis is the whole state closing down?</p>
