    <strong>The number of unmasked people around me daily are outnumbering the masked, but I'm not happy (UK)</strong>
    <p><p>For the best part of the last year, I've been unmasked. I was the only worker in my entire building who was. I could count the number of customers who weren't wearing a mask across the course of a month probably on one hand - two if I was lucky. But ever since restrictions were lifted a few weeks ago, the number of unmasked people significantly outnumber the masked.</p>
<p>This is good isn't it? Exactly what we want? No.</p>
<p>Because none of these people came to this mental conclusion of their own accord. The only reason why they've all taken their masks off is because they've been told that they are allowed and it's their own choice. When you only do something because you've been given permission, you never had any free will of the final situation whatsoever. The second they are told to put them back on by the government come winter, these people will listen and go right back to where we were before. </p>
<p>Everything you currently see is temporary for the summer, this is not us "winning".</p>
<p>I was judged by every single person in my workplace for not wearing a mask and the second they were all told they could officially remove them, they all did.</p>
<p>You are not surrounded by free thinker's or people who are on your side, the majority will turn on you at a moment's notice if instructed to by a higher power.</p>
<p>You will always be the enemy of the state if you choose to go against the narrative you're expected to blindly follow. Stay strong, follow your own instincts and be extremely careful of what information you divulge to those around you because everything can and probably will be used against you at some point in this fight.</p></p>

        <p>I feel the same. I'm UK too, they are also double jabbed which makes it seem to me they are giving up the mask because of that rather than anything else. And for the ones that are still wearing it... I've overheard 3 or so audibly moaning in the shop they don't like it, but "I guess it's for the best we keep it on" ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èand they are still mandating it on the tube, people happily comply. That's just on Sadiq khan's say so!  So yeah. Not happy</p>

        <p>Yeah, great post. Definitely conscious atm of using a bit of discretion whilst recognising the importance of planting seeds about the agenda</p>

        <p>This is exactly what the powers-at-be want, they will continue this destructive cycle if they are unopposed. I hope with enough time more people will see through the lies of the CDC and mainstream media, but it might already be too late.</p>
