    <strong>Fiance says she's probably going to get vaxxed one day (need advise)</strong>
    <p><p>I proposed to my fiance last year right before "covid" and I was pretty excited. However, ever since "covid", I have been telling her play-by-play how this is going to pan out. I told her that her job is going to be down-sized, she would work from home, mandatory vaxx would happen for travel and unemployment, masks would be permanent, and about the depopulation agenda 2030. Pretty much all of those things have come to pass and she called me a crazy nutjob for an entire year. I've collected a crazy amount of canned food, ammo, guns, and generators in that time just in case things ever go south. She didn't want to help with any of that. I have to give her props though. Like me, she doesn't wear a mask in most places and says that everything the media and government are doing are way overhyped. She doesn't watch the news or anything and we've been living our lives as pretty much normal. </p>
<p>However, I threw a hypothetical at her a month or two ago asking her if she would ever get the vaccine because I flat out told her I'm NEVER getting it. She says "Well, if the government mandates it and I HAVE to get it for my job one day in order to keep generating income, I probably will get it." I asked her what would happen if I wasn't able to generate income because I don't take a mandatory vaxx. Initially, she said she would "kick my ass out on the street." I understand not putting up my half of the finances and how that really screws her over. But I lost it. I took the ring back and left for a couple of weeks until she finally called me trying to patch things up. She said she didn't care if I didn't get the vaxx as long as I was able to provide for her in one way or another. She said she was still probably going to get her vaxx tho if push came to shove. I couldn't be any angrier and I have tried for months talking her out of it, but she keeps telling me that I can't "control her body" and that I'm being "selfish" for trying to look out for her health. This year has been a giant clusterfk of emotions and our relationship has gone down the tubes. </p>
<p>She took the ring back because deep down, she loves me more than anything. However, I'm not sure if I can watch her take this vaccine. I know something bad is going to happen. It will probably kill her. I can't imagine my life without her, but I really don't feel close to her anymore. She is starting to remind me of another drone that doesn't think. I told her that if we got married, she would have to promise to never take it. Once again, she said than I'm crazy and I can't control her body. She thinks I'm giving her an ultimatum, but really I am just trying to help. Once again, she gave the ring back.</p>
<p>What should I do? All I want to do is protect her. But I don't really have that attraction for her anymore, especially after this year. I want her to be happy as well. I don't want to ruin her life by telling her not to get a "covid passport". She wants to explore the world and be happy. Even if it means that the world is under 100% totalitarian control. My parents think I'm crazy so I can't ask them and I feel like if I talk to a therapist about this, they'll probably just look at me like I am crazy as well.</p></p>

        <p>You can't control her - she's right. It seems best that you go your separate ways seeing as there doesn't appear to be a compromise.</p>
<p>Edit: right about the control thing, not necessarily about taking the vax but that's her choice. Either you can live with it or you can't.</p>

        <p>You don’t see living your life without her yet you say that you lost all the attraction for her during the last year. You may want to reflect deeper on that.</p>
<p>I do agree with the comments above. It’s her choice and her decision. You can’t force her. Is having the vaccine a dealbreaker for you? </p>
<p>What I feel from your words is kind of a vibrational misalignment. You are on different frequencies. Is it worth the wait? Do you feel she is a good teammate for when things get worse? Etc</p>

        <p>The choice to vax or not vax goes both ways. She has the right and freedom to do what she wants for her body, as do you for yourself. You cannot force someone to not take it, you can recommend against it but at the end of the day it’s not your choice. </p>
<p>I wouldn’t let something like this end my relationship, especially if they were alright with me not getting it myself. I would take a step back and ask yourself if being right is more important than being with her. Because that’s basically what this sounds like to me. You say you want to protect her but it mostly sounds like you just want to be right.</p>

        <p>If I loved someone, I would never tell them I'd kick them out if they didnt have a job, no matter what the reason.  Here takinf the vax is one thing, trying to make you feel ashamed or threatened for not taking it is something else.</p>

        <p>If you don’t have attraction to her, you should probably let her go.  Regarding, the vaccine, it is her body, her choice.  Most likely she will be fine.  You should not hassle her about it.  However, if you are planning on having children, you need to be in agreement on how you are going to raise them.</p>

        <p>This is way too serious of an issue to agree to not agree on. What if you have children? Aside from what difficulties might arise for her after the vaccine. She will want the children covid vaxed? (And probably the other standards not sure your opinion on the current immunisation program) What then?
And there's also the travel part, even if she is allowed to travel with the vaccine, you won't? So she's happy to go off and experience all that without you?</p>
<p>You both sound like you're working on the logic of "they'll come round to see it my way"</p>

        <p>Leave. You shouldn't give ultimatums. You shouldn't want her to listen to you just because, which is obviously how she see's it. She has to see this shit on her own for EXACTLY what it is. You do she doesn't. Again, I hate to say it, but you gotta leave bro. If she agrees to go back and not take it you always have to worry about her going behind your back and doing it anyway and that is no way to be in a relationship.</p>

        <p>Women need to be led in this, they are social beings, who like to belong to the group, their perspective is different than us. You know the truth and she doesnt. In the deepest behaviour of women is to rely on a man. She doesn't take you seriously because she thinks you are overreacting. You need to perform such a display she understand the magnitude of the situation. This is the last war of humanity, and bad things are going to happen.
