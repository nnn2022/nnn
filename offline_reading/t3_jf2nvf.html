    <strong>Just responded to a post that was shaming anti mask people (yet another one, but not from s/coronavirus but a/mildlyinteresting). About to get downvoted into oblivion because I pointed out the hypocrisy of one of the comments</strong>
    <p><p>Comment:</p>
<p>i accidentally walked into the grocery store the other day without a mask. A store clerk said, "I'm sorry but you have to wear--"</p>
<p>Realizing the mistake, I cut them off and said, "I'm sorry, I'm not one of them!" put my hands over my mouth and ran back to the car.</p>
<p>Response:</p>
<p>How do you accidentally forget your mask?   Seems everyone here always proudly decries how upstanding and socially responsible they are but yet a simple thing like remembering a mast slips ones mind?</p>
<p>Doomers: why can’t everyone just wear a mask?  Fucking covidiots. It’s so simple. </p>
<p>Covidiots: beacause it’s against human nature to isolate yourself and hide facial expressions.  It’s part of natural communication </p>
<p>Doomers:  we’re humans with the ability to consciously act and change our ways.  It’s so easy. If those antimaskers had a brain and stopped worrying about “muh freedoms derrr” they would see it’s so easy</p>
<p>Doomer:  Walks into a store “accidentally”without a mask.  Actually human instinct kicking in.  Gets on her high horse to make sure no one accidentally associates her with the “bad people”</p>
<p>PROBABLY INFECTED LIKE 100 PEOPLE ON HER WAY IN AND OUT (but used the totally scientifically safe meathod of “hand over her mouth” technique.  </p>
<p>Most likely didn’t sanitize her hands after the totally effective hand over mouth mask. Walked back into store and proceeded to touch dozens of things back in. Door handle. Cart. Credit card machine. Food or whatever she was shopping or returning.  </p>
<p>I’m sure she’ll jump in now and say “I totally sanitized. Every knows that what responsible people do”</p></p>

        <p>19 downvotes so far.  Seems they don’t like receiving the same criticism that they dish out.  I was obviously exaggerating the response but man, they are taking it literally.  They can jump on a little idea that doesn’t agree with them and shame them into oblivion, but once you make a satirical response, they loose there mind</p>

        <p>Hand over the mouth works just the same as a mask. It doesn't prevent viruses either</p>

        <p>But it does have the added effect of covering your hands with germs to spread everywhere. Hand sanitizer is not as good as washing your hands with soap and water. I hope this psychopath actually washed their hands and didn't just lazily sanitize them. Probably not, though. Probably just slathered her body in toxic chinese made hand sanitizer and walked right in, spreading the virus everywhere and literally killing 3% of the people in the store. Gross.</p>
<p>(Just because everyone seems to think this virus has a 3% mortality rate, instead of .03% lmfao)</p>

        <p>I wouldn't expect them to show any critical thinking. Yet they call us stupid. They can call whatever they want, at least I don't have a diaper strapped to my head.</p>
