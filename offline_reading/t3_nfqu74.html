    <strong>Why nobody should get the vaccine, and what this is all leading up to</strong>
    <p><p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">CDC itself admits</a> that only 6% of the <a href="https://covidusa.net">1.8% CFR</a> of COVID cases die from COVID alone, and they have changed the way they report deaths so that <a href="https://www.who.int/classifications/classification-of-diseases/emergency-use-icd-codes-for-covid-19-disease-outbreak">anyone who dies with COVID in their system is counted as a COVID death</a>. Aside from COVID, these deaths are often reported differently—if someone had, say, tuberculosis, but they died of complications from uncontrolled diabetes, they would be listed as a diabetes death. Now, if you replace “tuberculosis” with “COVID,” it’s suddenly a COVID death.</p>
<p>Aside from the inflated death numbers that still lead to an actual CFR of .108%, which is almost exactly the same as the flu’s .13%, it’s not a good idea to get the vaccine for the reasons discussed in <a href="https://www.deconstructingconventional.com/post/18-reason-i-won-t-be-getting-a-covid-vaccine">this essay</a>.  In addition to this, <a href="https://themostbeautifulworld.com/blog/vaccine-studies">here</a> is a list of scientific studies showing that every previous attempt to make a vaccine for <em>any</em> coronavirus has ended disastrously, often with most or all of the lab animals dying, and that previous coronavirus vaccines have been shown to lead to complications such as liver damage, prion disease, and cytokine storms on exposure to variants. As seen in the essay, there is no evidence from the data released by any COVID vaccine company that any of these problems have been resolved in this latest attempt at a coronavirus vaccine.</p>
<p>In addition to this, <a href="https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/thousands-of-women-report-hemorrhaging-reproductive-dysfunction-miscarriage-after-corona-shots">the numbers with regard to fertility changes in women</a> strongly suggest that the vaccine has a negative impact on fertility and on pregnancy, which is congruent with <a href="https://dailyexpose.co.uk/2021/05/04/pfizer-confirms-covid-vaccine-shedding-leading-to-menstrual-cycle-disruption-is-possible/">what vaccine companies already knew was possible, even prior to release</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, a <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577">large study</a> of the “safety and efficacy” of the vaccine has a huge hole in it—they merely vaccinated participants and then hoped and prayed they would come into contact with the wild virus by chance. But there is no guarantee of exposure—far from it—so there is no actual test of safety OR efficacy, when you consider that most lab animals in previous coronavirus vaccine trials (which were systematically exposed to the virus they were vaccinated against) died of ADE, especially if they seemed to develop perfect antibodies.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://id.elsevier.com/ACW/?return=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com%2Faction%2FconsumeSsoCookie%3FredirectUri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.thelancet.com%252Faction%252FconsumeSharedSessionAction%253FI2KBRCK%253D1%2526JSESSIONID%253DaaaxMgxF_jwLS9MicyuOx%2526MAID%253DnwtDnnX6yA6uoIcAtieLwQ%25253D%25253D%2526SERVER%253DWZ6myaEXBLF%25252B9vQ18y9JMw%25253D%25253D%2526ORIGIN%253D844971718%2526RD%253DRD%2526exp%253D75icYvzOgUVEevYEfIgkYg%2525253D%2525253D%26code%3Dnull"><em>largest</em> study</a> of the safety and efficacy of COVID vaccines also has a glaring problem with it—it does not account for the incongruent testing of vaccinated versus unvaccinated people. The hospitalization rate of the unvaccinated is higher simply because the COVID test for a vaccinated versus an unvaccinated person is different. The one for the unvaccinated uses an <a href="https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/health/documents/cedep/novel-coronavirus/Ct_Fact_Sheet.pdf">RT-PCR Ct value between 35 and 40</a>, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html">even Fauci admits produces a useless result, that is, a 40-90% false positive rate</a>. The one the vaccinated are given, on the other hand, uses a much more reasonable <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/Information-for-laboratories-COVID-vaccine-breakthrough-case-investigation.pdf">RT-PCR Ct value less than or equal to 28</a>. What this means is that many unvaccinated people are actually being misdiagnosed when they go to the hospital, whereas far fewer vaccinated people are.</p>
<p>Here is a list of studies showing masks don’t work:</p>
<p><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">A May 2020 meta-study on pandemic influenza published by the US CDC found that face masks had no effect, neither as personal protective equipment nor as a source control</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/">No evidence for the effectiveness of cloth masks against virus infection or transmission</a></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200818072706/https:/www.uea.ac.uk/about/-/new-study-reveals-blueprint-for-getting-out-of-covid-19-lockdown">Mask requirement was of no benefit and could even increase the risk of infection</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data">University of Illinois concluded face masks have no effect in everyday life, neither as self-protection nor to protect third parties</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.asahi.com/sp/ajw/articles/13523664">Japanese researchers found that cloth masks “offer zero protection against coronavirus”</a></p>
<p>The reason for all of this trickery on the part of the elites is <a href="https://youtu.be/VT4lY6HWdfA">the Great Reset</a>. Broadly speaking, the Great Reset is a plan involving remaking the world’s economic and political systems on the basis that what we have now doesn’t work. There are many components of the Great Reset, lbut the core theme of it is sustainability in the form of “carbon neutrality,” as they put it.</p>
<p>That sounds good on the surface, even if they are taking advantage of the pandemic as <a href="https://www.weforum.org/focus/the-great-reset">“a rare but narrow window of opportunity to reflect, reimagine, and reset our world.”</a> As the saying goes, though, the devil is in the details—besides <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-out_of_fossil_fuel_vehicles">phasing out fossil fuels</a>, they will be <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9501565/How-Bidens-climate-plan-affect-everyday-Americans.html">cutting red meat consumption to just 4lbs per year (a 90% reduction)</a>, forcing people to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/environment/2021/04/04/home-radiators-will-have-ten-degrees-cooler-britain-reach-net/">turn their heaters 10 degrees Celsius cooler</a>, <a href="https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/299414/REP_Absolute_Zero_V3_20200505.pdf?sequence=9&amp;isAllowed=y">stopping shipping and air travel completely</a>, and many other things besides. Most ominous is the WEF’s vision for 2030, which involves <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBBxWtKKQiA">people “owning nothing” yet being “happy.”</a></p>
<p>The first of two major methods they are using to begin is process is COVID vaccination, which they are using to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/05/15/vaccine-passports-covid-19-vaccine-verification-coming/7130642002/">introduce vaccine passports</a>, the first of which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/01/nyregion/excelsior-pass-vaccine.html">having already been rolled out in New York (the Excelsior pass)</a>, to which it is conspicuously easy to attach a digital wallet. And this will likely be the next step, given the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/01/benefits-cashless-society-mobile-payments/">WEF’s open support of a cashless society.</a> It does not really need spelling out (but I will do so anyway) that the reason for this is to remove physical money from the equation in order to establish control; it is all well and good if you have money, but if you can’t use it because it’s all in the cloud and you’ve engaged in too many “dissident” activities,  then it doesn’t matter if you’re a broke college student or a multimillionaire—you’re still not going to be able to feed yourself.</p>
<p><a href="https://thecanadianreport.ca/is-this-leaked-memo-really-trudeaus-covid-plan-for-2021-you-decide/">The prevailing theory regarding taking away everyone’s property and possessions (or their ownership of them, at first) is that there will be a debt forgiveness program</a> (note: while I don’t know how true it is that that link is an actual leak, I am providing it because it makes logical sense, and shows I am not just making up my own theories on this). Once the economy has crashes, the government will say something like “we know the economy is terrible and you don’t have a job, the money to pay your debts, or the means to put food on the table; but if you join our debt forgiveness program, it’ll all go away, and you’ll receive a UBI payment, too.” But in order to join the program, you’ll have to be vaccinated and give up ownership of all your possessions. This would include money (after all, money is used to buy possessions).</p>
<p>The second way is through the budding cyber pandemic, which <a href="https://youtu.be/0DKRvS-C04o">Klaus Schwab himself said will make COVID look like a minor inconvenience, and will involve a grid-down scenario.</a> Indeed, there have already been <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-govt-fireeye-breached-after-solarwinds-supply-chain-attack/">attacks on SolarWinds and FireEye</a>. Most troublingly, FireEye’s offensive toolkit, one of the best in the world and normally used to test defensive software for large corporations and the government, was stolen in the hack. This was preceded by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210531124228/https://unlimitedhangout.com/2021/02/investigative-reports/from-event-201-to-cyber-polygon-the-wefs-simulation-of-a-coming-cyber-pandemic/">Cyber Polygon 2020, which conspicuously was planning for that exact type of hack, reminiscent of how Event 201 preceded the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic by just a few weeks</a>, and will shortly be followed by <a href="https://cyberpolygon.com">Cyber Polygon 2021 on July 9th</a>.</p>
<p>They will use this second line of offense to justify the creation of a new system, since the exploitation of these vulnerabilities, along with the shipping container and crop shortages (and other artificial agricultural vulnerabilities), will trigger a depression worse than the Great Depression of the 1930s and prove to the people that the current system doesn’t work.</p>
<p>That said, this isn’t even half of what is going on here, so I highly encourage you to look into it yourself.</p>
<p>We need a plan to stop this, before we are forced to bear the brand and burden of the technocrats’ whims.</p></p>

        <p>I didn’t include it because we don’t know that these are the end times. There is no proof that the vaccine, a mark on the shoulder, or the passports, an app on your phone, will ever become the mark of the beast. And, more to the point, the phrase about a mark on the hand or forehead meant, in the time it was written, that the marked person believed in/worshipped the person or thing to whom the mark (name) belonged. It’s much more likely that, during the end times, it would be impossible to buy or sell <em>without professing your belief in the antichrist</em>, no physical mark necessary.</p>
<p>Frankly, it’s not healthy to speculate about whether or not we’re in the end times or not. Humanity has jumped the gun on that one countless times, and we’ve always been wrong. It’s much better to focus on deepening your love of God, prayer, attending Divine Liturgy, and developing the fruits of the Spirit.</p>

        <p>It's about being a rational person--acting according to reality. If the Christian God exists (spoiler: He does), then it is rational to worship Him. You're right--being religious probably won't save us from other humans' misuse of their free will, but we are not here to be comfortable and complacent. We are here to learn to be holy out of love for God and in expectation of our eternal life.</p>

        <p>They already convinced most of the world to give up their rights last year. </p>
<p>I don't think they will ask people to give up their property so much as bring it into the system of compliance, where living in  any property in a major city becomes dependent on taking the vaccine and partaking in the system. That and price new property out of reach using hyperinflation.</p>

        <p>I don’t think we can say yet whether they have “minimal side effects.” The worst side effects wouldn’t be from the vaccine by itself, but from a vaccinated person being exposed to COVID, as shown in the list of studies I linked. </p>
<p>Also, I would be very careful of the claim that COVID cases have dramatically dropped in Israel, as <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/Information-for-laboratories-COVID-vaccine-breakthrough-case-investigation.pdf">vaccine breakthrough cases only count if they return positive with RT-PCR Ct value less than or equal to 28</a>, and <a href="https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/health/documents/cedep/novel-coronavirus/Ct_Fact_Sheet.pdf">the standard COVID tests use a value of 35-40</a>, a range that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html">even Fauci admits produces junk data with 40-90% false positive rate</a>.</p>
<p>Essentially, we’re comparing apples to oranges if we’re trying to compare the tests of vaccinated people to unvaccinated people, or in the case of Israel, where they’re overwhelmingly vaccinated, the tests from earlier in the year to now.</p>

        <p>The cases are extremely low in Israel that’s non debatable. The community transmission is also extremely low. </p>
<p>There’s no reason or indication that ADE will be a problem. Those who have gotten sick after vaccination haven’t gotten unusually sick if anything they are less sick. </p>
<p>Come to the hospital I work at there’s no covid cases compared to 4 months ago.</p>

        <p>I would not go using personal experience as proof of a general claim, as your experience could be a very poor representative of the norm. It’s also summertime in the northern hemisphere, so if you’re here (I assume you are, as you seem to indicate you’re in Israel), there would be very little seasonal illness in general.</p>
<p>I don’t doubt that the cases are low in Israel, given the time of year and the fact that the test you’re using is now more realistic, but I think it’s too soon to tell if you’re going to be getting a lot of ADE cases. It’s too early in the game—we’ll have to wait for fall to see that.</p>

        <p>This isn’t anecdotal evidence. I’m saying there are much less severe cases in the hospital with vaccination. That is undeniable proof it works.</p>
<p>Also Covid isn’t seasonal.</p>
<p>I don’t understand being scared of something that may happen when you see first hand people dying of covid and now with the vaccine much less people dying. </p>

        <p>You’re saying that <em>in your hospital</em> by <em>your estimation</em> they are less severe. That sounds like an anecdote to me if I ever saw one.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://www.livescience.com/climate-covid-19-seasonal-spread.html">COVID most definitely is seasonal</a>.</p>
<p>I’m scared of the vaccine—yes, I’ll openly admit that—because we don’t have the data to prove it’s safe, and the data we do have strongly suggests it’s anything but.</p>
<p>If you looked at the data I posted, you would find that COVID is no more deadly—actually, a tiny bit less deadly—than the flu, which we <a href="https://apnews.com/article/flu-has-disappeared-us-pandemic-2145d999319b53d8a32a829a324f398d">seem to have eradicated</a>. So no, people aren’t “dying of COVID.” People are dying of other things (as discussed in my original post) and testing positive for COVID due to that ridiculously high RT-PCR Ct range in standard COVID tests—unless, of course, you want to claim that in every other year “people were dying of the flu,” which is rather melodramatic, if you ask me.</p>

        <p>I’m starting to think you didn’t actually read my original post. Sure, 600k deaths is the official number. But 6% of that is 36k, which represents the COVID-alone figure (the true figure, if you want to compare COVID death numbers apples-to-apples with any other cause of death).</p>
<p>And 36k is definitely in line with those flu numbers I linked.</p>

        <p>Well, then I guess we need to redo the way we count <em>literally every other cause of death.</em> Because you’ll find that they’re all counted as cause-alone, not how COVID deaths are—where if you even had COVID in your system at the time of your death by, say, drug overdose, you’d be counted as a COVID death. It’s like my original tuberculosis example, and that’s why we have to calculate the COVID-alone numbers if we want to compare COVID death numbers to any other death numbers</p>

        <p>If that were true other countries wouldn’t have similar death rates when in reality they do. There’s no kick backs for writing covid deaths on certificate in Israel so it doesn’t make sense that we have a similar cfr to us.</p>
<p>Arguing with statistics usually doesn’t bode well. It doesn’t make you “anti authority” it just makes you wrong.</p>

        <p>A bunch of vietnamese farmers were able to defeat the "most powerful country in the world". A bunch of caveman's in Afghanistan's were able to crash the Soviet Union (and possibly the US now). Really, we have a pretty decent chance.</p>

        <p>Yes, which is <em>why we have to try.</em> If we sit here and just accept that we are doomed, then doomed we will be. If we try to do <em>something,</em> there’s a small chance we might not be.</p>

        <p>If you are a cocreator then you are vastly outnumbered by cocreators who are brainwashed. Acknowledging that we need help from God does not mean giving up. </p>
