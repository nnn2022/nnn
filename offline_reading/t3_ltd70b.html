    <strong>It’s really difficult to stay positive, but there is hope</strong>
    <p><p>(I hope I used an appropriate flair, I was struggling a bit)</p>
<p>Sometimes it feels like we’re completely doomed, like we’ll always be in the minority, like these lockdowns set a precedent for more lockdowns to be used at the drop of whatever hat future governments fancy, like the media will always hide our views away and/or demonise them, like we’ll never persuade anyone to join our side.</p>
<p>But throughout history, tyrants have been overthrown.  Freedom has been fought for.  Yes, people in power may have a tighter control over information than ever before, minimising the number of resistors, but there’s only so much they can do to suppress human nature.  And we CAN persuade people, I’ve done it!  Obviously it can be unhealthy to keep trying to persuade someone, as you could go nuts trying and trying, but I think to decide someone is a lost cause can also be a mistake, especially if they’re close to you.  No one (or at least hardly anyone) is becoming LESS skeptical of these lockdowns.  More and more people are joining THIS side, the movement is generally going one way, and it’s because everyone has a breaking point.  Eventually, fear of the dentist will be overcome by the pain of the toothache.  As the restrictions and the excuses for the restrictions become increasingly ridiculous, whoever is orchestrating this will overplay their hand.</p>
<p>Oddly, I am reminded of Lord of the Rings.  The ring wasn’t destroyed in an act of heroism by Frodo, but in an act of greed by both him and Gollum - even if good is rendered unable to triumph over evil, sometimes evil will eventually destroy itself.</p>
<p>We cannot give up hope.</p></p>
