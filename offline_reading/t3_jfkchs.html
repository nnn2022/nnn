    <strong>Photography Anxiety</strong>
    <p><p>I sincerely apologize as my thoughts do not translate through wording correctly, but hopefully you all will understand where I’m coming from and grasp what I’m trying to say. </p>
<p>I cannot stand the normalization that we must second guess, call out, and stigmatize ANY photograph that has been posted within the year. It seems that an individual has to explicitly note that a picture was taken “before covid” in order to avoid backlash and toxicity. I don’t understand why doomers have to automatically assume the absolute worst? </p>
<p>Situation that inspired such post: the college I attend just posted a picture of a bunch of athletes gathered in a classroom, appearing to be doing some sort of group activity. Of course, I was curious so I zoomed in on the photo and recognized some athletes that have since graduated from the university and no longer attend school/participate in sports. However, I figured there was going to be SOMEONE in the comments bitching about masks and such and sure enough, there was. “I hope this was taken beforehand...” and a reply that stated, “yeah, bad look for the PR team.” These type of instances boil my blood and cause nothing but concern, fear, and angst in the people. I’m not going to let my beloved sports teams be slandered so I replied and said there was no reason to imply that, and I got some bs response that was similar to the original comment.</p>
<p>I say all this because it absolutely concerns me that there is this normalization of calling out situations when all it takes is a moment of inspection/research to realize there isn’t cause for concern. ESPECIALLY considering that this is a university who has already faced backlash for their original situation back in Sept. There is no way they would purposely set themselves up. Have some common sense.</p></p>

        <p>I don't post many photos on my personal social media, but I refuse to post any photo with a damn mask on. It is obnoxious and purely for virtue signaling. They can die mad; mask selfies are ridiculous.</p>

        <p>Hey, you are not supposed to get riled up by things like that. What's the worst that will happen, they won't invite you to their party or something? Not that parties are allowed.</p>

        <p>On some of my local community Facebook pages, there are photos of people being given awards and stuff and half the people will have masks and half doesn't. There are usually a few posts complaining about people with no masks. I just report them all as spam or if they do it every day, I report it as harassment. It doesn't do anything obviously, but it's better than replying to them.</p>
