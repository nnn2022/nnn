    <strong>I feel like mask compliance in my area is drastically dropping now</strong>
    <p><p>On Friday I stopped at Walmart and I had never seen so few masks since probably June(?) It's normal that maybe 5 or so people in the whole store wouldn't have one. But Friday, it seemed as if every other person I saw wasn't wearing one. I know a lot of it was families or people in groups, but it was definitely much fewer than before, even compared to two or three weeks back.</p>
<p>Then I went to Lowes and there it seemed maybe 1/2 the people I saw, no masks. I even saw an employee talking to a couple that wasn't wearing them and the employee had his mask pulled down.</p>
<p>So I really think in my area that people are really getting tired of this. Now, maybe at any given time 1/2 to 3/4 might still have masks depending on when/where you go? But at this rate, I think at least some that are still wearing them, will decide if so many people aren't wearing them anymore, and it doesn't seem to make any difference, then they won't either.</p>
<p>I'm still wearing one for now, mostly because my parents are in their 60s and have at risk factors.</p>
<p>But I am just wondering how much longer this will go on. We don't have a mandate in my area, but I read where one county in Florida has extended their mask mandate until some time in April, so they'll have it all flu season. I'm wondering if after that they'll end the mandate or not.</p>
<p>To me the most ridiculous thing, that nobody talks about, is that we've never in history gone this far with any virus outbreak, that I'm even aware of. Maybe in Asia, but certainly not worldwide. I even read a few weeks ago that, unlike what I thought was the case, the country didn't shut down and cancel everything for the Spanish Flu for the whole two years! It was a few weeks at most, and concentrated more at the city level. What we're doing now doesn't compare to that, and yet people think this is totally necessary and a normal reaction.</p></p>

<p>This is going to sound harsh, but did you wear a mask during last year's flu season? If your parents are at risk of danger from covid, they're at risk of danger from the flu.</p>

        <p>Conversely here in the Netherlands I've never seen so many, I went to the shop today and counted 6 other shoppers, children excluded, in a store that probably had about 70 people in. A mandatory mask law is set to go in half November here and people seem eager to get it through.</p>
<p>Clarification: 6 people were <em>not</em> wearing masks.</p>

        <p>dont get why the Dutch implement it now. The Belgians have twice the infections despite having half your population. What makes your politicians think that now is the time to mask up?</p>

        <p>I went on a hike in the woods yesterday on a fairly popular trail.  Mask aren't even required outdoors here, but I'd say 90% of the people I passed where masked up - or at least had it with them and put it on when they passed my group.  I couldn't believe it.  My state is due to have around 150 deaths from covid this month.  The positivity rate of tests has been on a steady decline since early June.  There is no reason to be doing this.</p>

        <p>Wait I’m like SO confused.</p>
<p>There is no mandate. </p>
<p>You STILL wear a mask.</p>
<p>And you’re irritated that people are doing the exact same thing you are doing?</p>
<p>Is that the summary?</p>
