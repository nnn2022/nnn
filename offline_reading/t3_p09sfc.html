    <strong>Trust The BigPharma</strong>
    <p><p>Pfizer cares about you, its test subject, as it is aided and abetted by the United States Corporation in this PSYOP-19 “Vax” program, or is the the other way around? Does it even matter who is leading this Medical Tyranny dance as a small globalist cabal is clearly conspiring to accelerate the world into the real pandemic of PSYOP-21 that is literally weeks away?</p>
<p>Pfizer “earned” $18.98 billion in the second quarter of 2021 alone. Their blood clot drug Eliquis rose 13% and their cardiomyopathy drug Vyndaquel rose 77%; for the less astute reader, both of these drugs are treating the side effects from Pfizer’s &amp; the other BigPharma “Vax” offerings.</p>
<p>And now a little background into how this has been working for decades:</p>
<p>Pfizer received the biggest fine in U.S. history as part of a $2.3 Billion plea deal with federal prosecutors for mis-promoting medicines (Bextra, Celebrex) and paying kickbacks to compliant doctors. Pfizer pleaded guilty to mis-branding the painkiller Bextra by promoting the drug for uses for which it was not approved. |</p>
<p>In the 1990s, Pfizer was involved in defective heart valves that lead to the deaths of more than 100 people. Pfizer had deliberately misled regulators about the hazards. The company agreed to pay $10.75 Million to settle justice department charges for misleading regulators.</p>
<p>Pfizer paid more than $60 Million to settle a lawsuit over Rezulin, a diabetes medication that caused patients to die from acute liver failure.</p>
<p>In the UK, Pfizer has been fined nearly €90 Million for overcharging the NHS, the National Health Service. Pfizer charged the taxpayer an additional €48 Million per year for what should have cost €2 million per year.</p>
<p>Pfizer agreed to pay $430 Million in 2004 to settle criminal charges that it had bribed doctors to prescribe its epilepsy drug Neurontin for indications for which it was not approved.</p>
