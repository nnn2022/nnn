    <strong>I am an expert, and expert worship is the worst thing to happen to us.</strong>
    <p><p>Being an expert requires ability to defend a position, sometimes to a peer review committee, often to the tune of a company granting millions or billions of dollars on your persuasiveness alone.  </p>
<p>If an expert cannot defend their position to someone who’s holding out the pursestrings, they deserve to be defunded and fired.  </p>
<p>You, the workers, homeowners, and free citizens of America, have an absolute right to have the experts clearly articulate their rationale and reasoning to you when they ask you to sacrifice freedoms, economies, and standard of living.  </p>
<p>Do question us and tell us you’re not convinced and why. PLEASE. This is literally how we become better at articulating ourselves.</p></p>
