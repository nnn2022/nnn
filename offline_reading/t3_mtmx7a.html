    <p><p>Had to go to multiple stores today and no one gave a fuck about me not wearing a mask except for one Lady. And this Lady handed me a Mask and Iâ€™m like no thank you. Iâ€™ve already had Chinese Virus. (Was sick last week). (Possibly Chinese or the Flu but the Flu magically disappeared so everything is automatically Chinese Virus). </p>
<p>Sheâ€™s like well Iâ€™m not supposed to serve you if you donâ€™t have a mask. I just smiled and said No Thank You I like to breathe fresh air. She mumbled something to herself about everyone being safe. </p>
<p>I told her itâ€™s not about safety. Itâ€™s about control. If the Government cared about Safety they would have mandated masks in the beginning and yet they didnâ€™t. </p>
<p>I just kept on smiling and she served me anyways. </p>
<p>These are the type of people that I am trying to reach. </p>
<p>WE HAVE TO BREAK THE PROGRAMMING. </p>
<p>The Vaccine is already here. Why do people still give a Fuck about Masks? If you believe the 95.97% Propaganda of effective rate which just happens to be also the survival rate of Chinese Virus. Why do you care about Masks?</p>
<p>I also donâ€™t understand all the Mask Freak Out Videos that appear on Reddit. Itâ€™s not difficult to have a conversation with people. She was freaking out on the inside but not on the outside because she didnâ€™t want to lose her job. ðŸ’€</p>
<p>My Will is stronger then her will. She gave in. I didnâ€™t. She didnâ€™t want to serve me. And yet she still did. I think she served me even though the Mask Nazi in her was telling her not two is because she understood the Logic I was presenting. Deep down Mask Nazis know itâ€™s bull shit. </p>
<p>I myself am still a little bit under the control of the Mask Nazis though. I still grabbed a mask and put it in my pocket out of habit. I need to break that habit.</p></p>

        <p>I went into a store yesterday and was told I had to wear a mask to buy anything.</p>
<p>I asked the security guard, "how long are you going to wear masks?  I did as they asked for 60 days.  They said it was only 15 days. It's been a year now.  Do you think this is going to end until we stop obeying?"</p>
<p>He finally said, "you're right. I don't wear them either when I'm not here. But I need this job. Sorry."</p>

        <p>I bet none of those stores was a target, mall, or supermarket. And that girl was probably working at a small business, where her boss is scared to death of the gestapo fining them again.</p>

        <p>How is she a mask nazi if she let you purchase something without a mask? She was just telling you what she's supposed to tell every customer without a mask. Looking at people in the service industry just doing their job as Nazis doesn't help anyone. Chill with the rhetoric. </p>
<p>You're just making yourself sound stupid and hostile. It's COVID-19, not the China Virus. Masks aren't programming, they aren't going to suffocate you doing normal activities. There's plenty of people, especially in other counties, that wore masks of their own volition before the pandemic for flu season, allergies, and pollution. </p>
<p>This subreddit overall is fair saying the cost of lockdowns may not have been worth the benefits, or even that the lockdowns may have been ineffective. What is delusional is thinking the response to COVID-19 was some brainwashing or social experiment. A mask is just a mask.</p>
