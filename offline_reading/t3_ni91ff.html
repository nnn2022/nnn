        <p>Also I got to say I now hate my coworkers more than ever. In the beginning of the pandemic, none of them believed ANY of this and they continued to go to work, eating lunch together etc while having the option to work from home (I worked from home, but mainly because I hate them). I come back and they are the first ones who got vaccinated while I'm now the "anti vaxer"? I'm not an anti vaxer. I'm a "Heyyyyy, maybe we should wait a few years to see the effects of it" vaxer.</p>

        <p>That's why I'm resentful too. I was ON THIS SHIT before anyone and being laughed at for wearing an N95. Even Drs offices got passive aggressive and we're like, "are you sick? Why are you wearing a mask?" It didn't take long for me to start questioning the official narrative. But everyone else who didn't believe me fell right in line. They got scared when they were told to. Not one thought in their brain is their own.</p>

        <p>I knew this was bullshit from the beginning. I NEVER wore a mask except for a handful of times because I had to but I knew from day one this was complete bullshit. I laughed at people like you before the mandates and then I shook my head in dismay when I saw others doing the same thing after.</p>
<p>Honestly I am kinda pissed at people like you who basically started all this. It's kinda your fault, so thank you for destroying my job and giving authorities the "great" idea of mandating mask.</p>

        <p>That's fair. My position has always been "I don't trust the government". And at first it seemed they were doing things that were making it spread on purpose. Usually it's the stuff the government hides that actually warrants worry. When the full on campaign rolled out that's when I started to question it. And I was never in favor of government control to solve the "problem".</p>

        <p>Right? I totally get why the elderly get it as well as people who have diabetes, the obese, major health conditions get it to take care of their own health, but why should I have to get it if I can just continue to mask up and wash my hands?!</p>

        <p>They say "herd immunity" but they don't know why they're saying it. In herd immunity the vaccinated are, well, immune. Being surround by immune people is supposed to keep illness away from me those who can't or simply don't have the vaccine. </p>
<p>Yet they act like herd immunity is for the vaccinated and the unvaxxed are evil and selfish, whether they are medically unable to get a vaccine or simply aren't comfortable injecting experimental treatments into their bodies for a cold virus?</p>
<p>They're trying to play on the "your mask protects me. My mask protects you" thing, but with vaccines. They don't even know they're being fed the same collectivist talking points all over again</p>

        <p>They're pushing the narrative that it's for the health of others around you who are immunocompromised. They say "if you're healthy enough to not need it, you're healthy enough to take it."</p>
<p>LOL. Ridiculous.</p>
<p>People seems to be forgetting that your immune system IS a means of immunity.</p>

        <p>I avoid the vaccine for a completely different reason: being the leader that I am (and you have to say this while touching yourself), I let others speak, eat, and take the vaccine first. Their safety and well-being is far more important than mine. So you see, I'm not actually an anti-vaxxer, I'm just selfless.</p>

        <p>Exactly. I wear a mask at work (self employed) because I accept money from the blind fearful as well as thinking people. I only wear a mask for those who are the blind fearful. That's two people. I see people one at a time, so that's maybe an hour a week. Outside of that, no mask. I breathe real fresh air just like I always have. People are afraid they can stay the f*** home.</p>

        <p>Right there with you. I need to know that it's safe and won't cause complications before I will consider it. </p>
<p>I'm trying to be a responsible parent for my future children in waiting to see the results of the trial. Which, to Bill Gates own admission, takes <strong>time!</strong> I'm fine living in a mask til then, whatever. But don't force me to get an experimental medical procedure against my own will when I'm just trying to do the right thing for me and my family. That's just downright cruel.</p>

        <p>There's a good reason why drugs typically take 5 to 10 years of HUMAN TRIALS before being brought to market. That's not even including research, development and animal trials. Its dumb to not be afraid of taking something that's skipped most of the testing.</p>

        <p>Considering how many people are getting the "vaccine" I think it's a real possibility if a large enough percent get some dangerous side effects. One theory going around is that these drugs will weaken your immune system and cause a dependence. If that does turn out to be true the next time we have an even slightly above average bug goes around that could overwhelm the hospitals.</p>

        <p>Under 40s produce the vast majority of babies and they're only just getting offered the vaccine now in the UK. So we won't have any half reliable numbers here for people who were vaccinated pre pregnancy for another 8-9 months.</p>

        <p>For the most part that data dosen't exist yet. They never tested it on pregnant women and only a few doctors are irresponsible and reckless enough to let their pregnant patients take it. But I have heard of several miscarriages because of it. The placenta was horribly inflamed, presumably it's because after the vaccine the immune system mistook the placenta for a virus and started attacking it.</p>

        <p>Pretty sure they cannot actually challenge your “religious beliefs”.  And many states have philosophical exemptions as well. All 3 vaxs used right now involve the use of aborted fetal cells. So, I mean it’s subjective i guess but I for one want no part of that.</p>

        <p>Do you trust FDA approval if they'd receive that? Or a traditional vaccine vs mRNA? I am in the same boat as you, but I am so frustrated about potentially being blocked from travel as I live abroad from my whole family. I am grasping at straws now,even considered freezing my eggs in case any future ones will be marked I'd still have a collection of clean ones. But I'd probably have kids in a year or two anyway and am young enough not to be worried about my bio clock, so that's a huge expense for that! I don't know what to prioritize anymore. Seeing my family or protecting my future one.</p>

        <p>What makes it more frustrating is that even if there are birth defects there is no way for any of us to actually fight and show that it was the sole cause or trigger (among already other many possible causes, as well as depending on what) that makes me feel it’s all a hopeless cycle. We can get it shown that Company X spilled Y that got into a community’s water supply and caused miscarriages and birth defects. Not our own government (at least not until many years after). I would probably feel better with FDA approval, but approval seems even pointless when we are aware how bought out people and institutions are.</p>

The workers there were frequently tested as were the residents and no visitors were allowed. Each week there would be status updates on Covid numbers at the facility. My grandmother had pneumonia (had it a few times in her last years and just beat it however her myeloma returned so she was on a ton of painkillers and eventually morphine in order to not be in physical agony eventually dying. When my mother got the death certificate, it said the death was due to Coronavirus. My mother was furious because she never had it!!!! My mom ended up telling the office that and they changed it due to complications of myeloma and they said that it was a clerical error.... I really wonder how many death certificates were incorrectly written this way.</p>

        <p>No one's business. You are kind to continue to be OK with a mask. Simply refuse to engage with the fools. If you just want to shut them up, just lie. Otherwise just say it's private medical information and legally they can't ask.</p>

        <p>You’re not dumb, and it’s your personal choice. If your actions aren’t increasing infection risk for others around you, that’s all that matters. Children have already been born to mothers vaccinated during pregnancy, and there are currently clinical trials ongoing for pregnant individuals. You could read up on how these are going if you want to feel more educated on this topic.</p>

        <p>Yeah, totally just a conspiracy theory of one noted adverse reaction after another. Just like my previous conspiracy theory of vaccine passports. </p>
<p>There is absolutely no study with any evidence whatsoever on what potential effects may happen for conceptions and childbirth after a vaccination rollout noted for severe side effects, that also have no studies on the long term ramifications of these side effects. </p>
<p>Get the fuck out of here with your bullshit propping up the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
