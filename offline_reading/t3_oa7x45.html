        <p>I got downvoted on another sub for saying that this is clear discrimination.</p>
<p>I have been vaccinated but a lot of young people can’t because the government won’t let them. And others can’t because of health reasons. And <em>they</em> are being punished for it.</p>
<p>Another thing, it’s so weird. People were FUMING when it was hinted at and leaked by the press but the second it’s officially announced the pendulum has swung and now people seem to support it more. This has happened for literally anything covid and lockdown related since last year. I don’t understand it.</p>

        <p>I got into a discussion on the Irish Times Facebook page (I know, I know) and a fella literally said we should live based not on reality but "possible future realities". Imagine not only living your life like that, but trying to force everyone else to, as well.</p>

        <p>There is a massive pushback though. Other TDs are absolutely furious, even from the more liberal parties. I believe there may be a debate coming up about it. I’m glad to see it, finally. This is the biggest backlash I’ve seen this whole time.</p>
<p>I’m vaccinated so I guess I shouldn’t be so upset about this, but people are already saying no way will publicans enforce this. In fact, rules have been bent this whole time. When they blocked off clothing sections in Dunnes for example, I heard you could just ask an employee for something and they’d get it for you even though you weren’t supposed to. I heard of a restaurant allowing some patrons to eat inside when it started raining. But that’s what worries me. The government knows this is unenforceable, so I predict that in two weeks they’ll just ban indoor dining for all. Because if only vaccinated people were allowed to dine indoors, you <em>know</em> pub owners would ignore that after some point.</p>
<p>I hope the numbers don’t get much higher at all with few deaths in the coming months so I can see Tony’s humiliated face. This is the final nail in the coffin for him, Leo, and Micheál. All three of them are pricks.</p>

        <p>Ireland is insane when it comes to this. There was even a time, early on, when we weren't allowed 2km away from our homes unless for 'essential reasons'. The third lockdown began in December, and most places didn't reopen until a few weeks ago, and, of course, indoor dining is still closed. And now it's all delta varient, delta varient......</p>

        <p>What the hell is going on in Ireland and Europe? Plans for proving vaccination is code for them saying they’re developing a vaccine passport</p>

        <p>The rest of Europe isn't acting like this. I'm Irish but live in Denmark and everything is open (most things still require a negative test but I'd take fully open with testing over not opening at all for over a year), to the point that the European Championship was played last week with 50k~ people.  While we're obviously slower to reopen than the US, most countries are now dropping restrictions weekly. Ireland is the only one still taking the piss at this stage.</p>
<p>Europe has a Covid passport, but it's not a vaccine passport (yet, at least). It documents previous infection, vaccination, or negative tests which are widely available. Ireland is the only one that wants to illegally discriminate against the unvaccinated and will hold the country hostage if they don't get their way.</p>

        <p>I wish I could go back in time and tell myself not to move here. I’m serious. My dad even admitted to me that I ended up picking the worst country to move to. My summer is completely ruined and it’s all because of the idiot government and stupid Tony fucking Holohan of all people. And the saddest part is I know nobody will fight back. I am in tears right now.</p>
