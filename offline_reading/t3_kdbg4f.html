    <strong>Covid infections in Vaccine vs placebo group</strong>
    <p><p>“among 3410 total cases of suspected but unconfirmed COVID-19 in the overall study population, 1594 occurred in the vaccine group vs. 1816 in the placebo group. Suspected COVID-19 cases that occurred within 7 days after any vaccination were 409 in the vaccine group vs. 287 in the placebo group. It is possible that the imbalance in suspected COVID-19 cases occurring in the 7 days postvaccination represents vaccine reactogenicity with symptoms that overlap with those of COVID-19. Overall though, these data do not raise a concern that protocol-specified reporting of suspected, but unconfirmed COVID-19 cases could have masked clinically significant adverse events that would not have otherwise been detected.”</p>

<p>I’m sorry, WHAT?! Is that seriously the difference in infections?? That’s not evens statistically significant! Can someone please correct me if I’m wrong??</p></p>

        <p>The only certain way to stop climate change if its real is to reduce the number of people on the planet.   If the vaccine is poison, you indiscriminately kill doctors and mechanics,  people you need.  But if you make people sterile population will drop rapidly.  And you didn't kill anyone.</p>
<p>It could be a cover to kill  all of India or Africa.   That would open up huge resources and reduce population. </p>
<p>Even if you cause cancer in 10 years,  you still  kill off to many vital people.</p>
<p>Even if half the vials are active and the other half aren't population growth is halved in a generation.</p>

        <p>Except that you cannot be sure that the 'correct' people will be sterilized. Especially when well meaning Grandma or Grandpa of the 'next oligarchy' can take Janna or James out, get them the shot, and if it does mess with fertility accidentally sterilize them.</p>
<p>This stuff just doesn't pass the bullshit test. It is not going to intentionally sterilize people... full stop, immovable object in the way.</p>
<p>It might accidentally do that... but I seriously doubt that, even after reading how it supposedly 'targets' that one thing that all females need to get pregnant.</p>

<p>How does your BS meter add up the 2020?  What do you think is going on?  You just can't  say I'm wrong with giving a better opinion.</p>

        <p>This part of the paper is looking at cases that occurred of suspected covid-19. That is, patients who met some criteria for covid 19 infection during the study- fever, myalgia, cough, shortness of breath- basically any flu like syndrome, however most of these symptomatic patients teated negative for covid 19, so such cases were not included in the official case total. </p>
<p>Which makes sense if you think about it. Negative PCR test should not count as a case. </p>
<p>If only they were counting covid deaths and covid hospitalizations the same way.</p>
