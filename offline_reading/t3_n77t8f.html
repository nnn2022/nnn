        <p>This is why it’s so hard to get through to people. You have to understand data and statistical analysis and transparency deltas etc. And most people just can’t get it or won’t listen. </p>
<p>Imagine if cnn had a “vaccine death” count tracker like it does a COVID death count tracker.</p>

        <p>Tucker Carlson claimed over 3,000 people have died because of Covid Vaccines.  The number and how he derived this supposed fact are suspect.  Even so you do the math 4,000 die! 150 million vaccine shots in the US.</p>

        <p>Check out hhs.gov to see how many people have severe side effects from vaccines, including death. Hint, it’s 1-2 people per million. Use that info to make yourself a more informed citizen instead of spouting Fox News and infowars talking points.</p>

        <p>I would just say simpler things like WMD in Iraq or the gulf of Tonkin.  Or even the sinking of the US Maine.  So many reasons to not trust our government.  People who trust them are blind or ignorant.</p>

        <p>Then where do you draw the line? How do you find an acceptable source? Like there has to be a common ground on sources, at least that are trustworthy to any informed individual across the spectrum.</p>
<p>Are there any new experiments like that? I understand it’s highly probable that if they are around, they’re classified, and we won’t know.</p>

        <p>Holy shit, they basically fudged <strong><em>all</em></strong> the important stuff:</p>
<p>Excluding "suspected" cases of COVID because they didn't meet the PCR threshold:</p>
<p>&rt; All attention has focused on the dramatic efficacy results: Pfizer reported 170 PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases, split 8 to 162 between vaccine and placebo groups. <strong>But these numbers were dwarfed by a category of disease called “suspected COVID-19”—those with symptomatic COVID-19 that were not PCR confirmed.</strong> According to FDA’s report on Pfizer’s vaccine, there were “3410 total cases of suspected, but unconfirmed COVID-19 in the overall study population, 1594 occurred in the vaccine group vs. 1816 in the placebo group.”</p>
<p>Excluding all kinds of critical data from their public report:</p>
<p>&rt; an analysis of severe disease irrespective of etiologic agent—namely, rates of hospitalizations, ICU cases, and deaths amongst trial participants—seems warranted, and is the only way to assess the vaccines’ real ability to take the edge off the pandemic. There is a clear need for data to answer these questions, but Pfizer’s 92-page report didn’t mention the 3410 “suspected COVID-19” cases. Nor did its publication in the New England Journal of Medicine. Nor did any of the reports on Moderna’s vaccine. The only source that appears to have reported it is FDA’s review of Pfizer’s vaccine.</p>
<p>Suspiciously high numbers of "protocol deviations" for Pfizer:</p>
<p>&rt; Another reason we need more data is to analyse an unexplained detail found in a table of FDA’s review of Pfizer’s vaccine: 371 individuals excluded from the efficacy analysis for “important protocol deviations on or prior to 7 days after Dose 2.” <strong>What is concerning is the imbalance between randomized groups in the number of these excluded individuals: 311 from the vaccine group vs 60 on placebo. (In contrast, in Moderna’s trial, there were just 36 participants excluded from the efficacy analysis for “major protocol deviation”—12 vaccine group vs 24 placebo group.)</strong> What were these protocol deviations in Pfizer’s study, and why were there five times more participants excluded in the vaccine group?</p>
<h1>Why did they do all this statistical manipulation and why are they hiding so much data from the public, you ask?</h1>
<p>&rt; With 20 times more suspected than confirmed cases, this category of disease cannot be ignored simply because there was no positive PCR test result. Indeed this makes it all the more urgent to understand. <strong>A rough estimate of vaccine efficacy against developing COVID-19 symptoms, with or without a positive PCR test result, would be a relative risk reduction of 19% (see footnote)—far below the 50% effectiveness threshold for authorization set by regulators.</strong></p>
<p>As Colonel Landa would say, "that's a bingo."</p>
<p>If they didn't fudge the numbers, they wouldn't be able to sell their shitty vaccine to the government for billions of dollars.</p>

        <p>One question does arise though. What does suspected case mean? So if you have a fever due to anything else, or a cough, or fatigue this probaply makes you a suspected case wouldnt it? I would like to see the parameter in which you are considered a suspected case and not. Since these symptoms are not unique to covid and the vaccine is not against the specifix symptoms but symptoms caused by covid. So it doesnt mean you will not get a fever after the vaccine but you will not get a fever due to covid after the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Pharma rep here.  Actually they didn't make it up....RRR (relative risk reduction) is calculated via hazard ratios in trials.  The ARR (absolute risk reduction) is what everyone needs to focus on....162 out of 22k in the placebo group = 0.74% infection rate.  8 out of 22k in the vaccinated group = 0.04 infection rate.  BOTH VERY LOW NUMBERS LESS THAN 1%!  So to get the ARR just subtract 0.04 from 0.74 and you get 0.7% absolute reduction.  Forget the 95% RRR and focus on the 0.7 ARR.  When a judgmental vaccine freak tries to lecture you, just remind them that the ABSOLUTE RISK REDUCTION IS LESS THAN ONE PERCENT!!!!  My customers would laugh me out of their office if I came to them with a drug that showed 0.7% ARR vs placebo...trust me</p>

        <p>I didn't mean the 95% number was thrown in. But they do  use  the relative associations always, because the absolute just shows a tiny difference which is not meaningful. Same goes for many drugs. So it's like they don't state what really happens</p>

        <p>yep understood....they "bend" what happens in the trial to make it seem like you have a 95% chance of getting Covid if you don't take the vaccine.  It's disgusting.....and all these liberal bleeding hearts are all of the sudden immunologists and statisticians but truth be told it's literally less than 1% benefit which is laughable at best.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the useful info - how are normal vaccines efficacy measured?</p>
<p>I have seen years ago that they rarely are more effective than 10%, but I do not know if they mean ARR or RRR, now that I know the terms!</p>

        <p>I went to the Twitter link and there is a PhD who wrote an article in Medscape "explaining" why we shouldn't look at the ARR in a vaccine trial.  He states:</p>
<ul>
<li>The trials occurred over a few months, whereas the disease(s) they are intended to prevent will probably (in the absence of vaccines) remain with us for far longer than that.</li>
<li>They occurred during a time when people are probably taking risk-mitigation measures (masking and social distancing) that we hope to one day relax, meaning the ARR is lower than it would be in a "fully open" society with no risk mitigation.</li>
<li>They were designed with event-driven analyses, which place a relatively low ceiling on the maximum ARR they can demonstrate; furthermore, this feature of vaccine trials is necessary to produce results in time for the vaccine to be useful in reducing spread of the disease.</li>
</ul>
<p>My question to him is, if this is true, why can't this same logic be applied to why we shouldn't look at Relative Risk Reduction?  Especially one that comes out to be 95% vs a placebo?</p>

        <p>I saw a post in /askdocs this past week. Woman had a rash all over her body, and I read the post…sure enough a covid vaccine trial participant (outside US). She didn’t think it was from the vaccine because she thinks she is in the placebo group. People in the comments reminded her to report it either way. It made me really question how ethical and throughout the trials are with self reporting.</p>

        <p>You aren't likely to get covid in a given day, even unvaxed.  In fact, during the clinical trial the group that got placebo, only 0.84% got covid over two months.  You can also see this in how a year later not everyone's had covid, or how not everyone gets the flu in a year.</p>
<p>Anyhow, that 0.84% chance reduced by 95% to be 0.05% of the vaccinated group getting covid during the trial.  So, you would in actuality reduce your risk of getting covid by 0.79th of a percent.</p>
<p>Basically they are saying there's a 95% off sale at their store, so you drive there and find out the 95% off is only on this regularly 20 cent piece of candy and you wasted more gas getting there than the 19 cents you saved.</p>

        <p>Here’s one way to think about relative vs absolute risk. </p>
<p>The absolute risk of you dying of covid is very low. It’s the risk of getting covid (maybe 50-70%) multiplied by the IFR (something like 0.3%)- dramatically lower if you are young and healthy. </p>
<p>The relative risk that someone dies if they get covid however is quite a bit higher than if they never got covid. But it’s not that big of a deal because the absolute risk is still very low. </p>
<p>If you wanted to make covid seem bad, you would talk only in terms of relative risk, and you would ignore the absolute risk.</p>

        <p>The reporting really should be in terms of absolute risk. The problem is that the absolute risk is so small, that the numbers are hard for most people to make sense of. Relative risk is easier for people to understand who aren’t mathematically inclined and it’s how risk gets conveyed in the lay press. So you get CDC press releases that looks like this:</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-age.html</p>
<p>The problem is that they never give the absolute risk, so the numbers are kind of meaningless. This is true for most kinds of relative risk. If you don’t know the baseline risk, you really have no idea what the risk actually is. You really need both numbers.</p>

        <p>&rt; You really need both numbers to really have a good understanding.</p>
<p>This makes sense.</p>
<p>So it is likelihood to get it at all and die vs likelihood to die if you have it?</p>

<p>These numbers, which I take to mean 1200%, 500%, or 870,000% seem pretty alarming. So this seems like they are ARR, which means</p>
<p>Yes, I see why knowing both is much more useful. It also shows that if the real number of cases, both of people who died 'with covid' and are counted, as well as simple false positives at high Ct PCR, the real death risk can be much lower for both ARR and RRR.</p>

        <p>Yes relative risk is just risk of death with the disease divided by some baseline risk of death (the control). So, if twice as many people die from a disease compared to the background risk of death, the “relative risk” of that disease is 2X. </p>
<p>In the example above, they are using the risk for 5-17 year olds as the control group. So the risk of an 85+ year old dying if they get coronavirus is 8500X the risk for a 5-17 year old.</p>

        <p>Some great posts in this thread. Where the hell were all you common senses stats people last year lol....</p>
<p>I'll throw one your way, It took 70 days from the 1st death in the US to the 25,000th, using a simple growth calculator and assuming a 2% death rate, the infection rate would have been and r3, and at this rate the entirety of the US population would have been exposed, infected and / or dead within the next few months, even factoring in a slower infection rate due to "measures"..What is really the mind blower, is that if you reduce the death rate, the infection rate increases drastically, thereby rapidly accelerating the point of infection saturation in the population.</p>
<p>I also calculated what the r factor would have had to have been to identifiably infect 20 countries within 2 months (Dec 2019 - Jan 2020), by calculating both domestic and international travel. The results were a minimum of an r6 infection rate, which would have decimated the entire globe in the few weeks following....</p>
<p>The real stats / data tells the truth, but so few people seem to understand these concepts.</p>

        <p>You are correct is wasn't until I asked myself "how does one come up with the number "Over 90% effectiveness"? I didn't need this to be apprehensive about sticking out my arm, but its another reason to think about it, if someone is on the fence.</p>

        <p>&rt; We already know that current Covid-19 vaccine trials are unlikely to show a reduction in severe illness or deaths. (Doshi, BMJ 2020;371:m4037, October 21) Will they be like seasonal influenza vaccines, which have not proved to be lifesavers, and may even have increased overall mortality in the elderly? (Anderson et al, Ann Intern Med 2020;172:445) We need a lot more time and a lot more data, especially in view of massive uncertainties about Covid-19 case definitions and statistics.</p>

        <p>That book is brilliant by the way! It even has a short passage about how mass testing and searching for a disease in an area caused a massive spike in cases which in turn caused some hysteria (it's near to the back of the book as I recall it).</p>

        <p>I think both stats are relevant and necessary to understand the picture. Knowing just the “0.7% reduction in absolute risk” or just the “95% reduction in relative risk” doesn’t explain the whole picture. Neither stat really tells you the whole picture: you’re starting with a low risk to begin with and dropping to a slightly lower risk.</p>

        <p>I would appreciate if someone had the time period of these studies. From what I can tell online, many of these studies are about 14 days long or so. In this case, .7% absolute risk is referring to the absolute risk over 14 days. If you increase the time period, you can effectively add this risk up, although there are a few other variables to consider to make an accurate guess.</p>
<p>Additionally, absolute risk reduction does not measure the overall leftover risk. If the control had 7.0% infected, and the vaccine had 1.0% infected, the vaccine could claim a reduction of 6.0% absolute risk, when 1.0% of people remained infected. This results in a relative risk reduction of 84%, which is more than 3x more people infected when compared to 95% risk reduction.</p>
<p>Absolute risk reduction is only useful when you consider the time scale.</p>

        <p>The problem is, this percent is used to trick peoples now, not in 2 years when they finish the testing, and the bodies piled up.Until then, both of these should be ran by all media, governments, health specialists, and not just the 95 % one that a normal person doesn`t fully understand.</p>

        <p>The positives after vaccines is also related to the RT-PCR cycles. CDC gave away the fact that vaccinated should be tested at 28 and lower, while the pandemic was created from the misuse of 38-56 cycles, wich gives you a 96 % covid19 positive (i might be wrong about the exact percent here, but it`s extremly high), because they don`t have the original virus up to date to set the correct treshhold for tests.</p>

        <p>I like this article. As an engineering student statistics is my favorite branch of mathematics because people underestimate the difficulty. Sure a triple integral may be hard but understanding the statistics and underlying factors is usually very hard.</p>
<p>I'm still a bit skeptical about this article when they mention "risk of symptoms". I'm no biologist so I don't know if the risk considers long term symptoms such as depression and loss of taste (cit. needed but I think you can find then on Google) or just the short ter shortness of breath and fever. It would add another variable in the calculation of risk.</p>
<p>Note that I only skimmed the article so I might have missed things</p>

        <p>What this article is not telling the reader - probably on purpose - is that the absolute risk of catching COVID depends on all the safety measures we take as a society. It is only that low, because enough people take precautions like social distancing, wearing masks and quarantining. The relative risk reduction tells you that no matter how high the absolute risk and independent from other factors, the vaccine will prevent 95% of all symptomatic COVID cases and practically all COVID deaths. This then allows society to keep the absolute risk of getting ill or dying from COVID low without taking the extra precautions mentioned above.</p>

        <p>What the government is not telling you - probably on purpose -  is that autumn will come, and vaccinated peoples with overused immune system will be extra susceptible to all coronaviruses out there, not just this one , and a new Covid19 pill with monoclonal antibodies produced by Pfizer, will replace your immune system, and you will need it for life, same as vaccines, while the lockdowns are here to stay as the masks also, wich have 0 efficacity against a virus and they were never ment to stop any kind of transmission.</p>

        <p>monoclonal antibodies in pill-form would be a real scientific break-through. Almost all antibody therapies (there are hundreds for all kinds of illnesses) are given IV, SC or IM. The pill you are talking about is still a long way from approval and is so far only tested for treatment of those who are already hospitalized with COVID. </p>
<p>You don‘t have to to get vaccinated or wear a mask. Lucky for you, enough people are reasonable enough to do it and protect society as a whole and you along with it. The ‚sheeple‘ are actually protecting you and will allow you to continue your Morpheus cosplay without having to worry about the rona hoax.</p>

The protecting part im not so sure tho at this point, because of the shedding thingy and the mother killing baby after taking vaccine and breast feeding, but i sure hope that was a rare case.Wish you the best wichever side you are on !</p>

        <p>As long as you are aware that the people who disagree with you are not blind or afraid you are fine. It is possible to consume the same information and come to a different assessment of the situation. The majority of people seem to agree that wearing masks and getting vaccinations are small inconveniences with low risks that are necessary to get back to normal (not „new normal“ just normal). Maybe this thing will vanish like the spanish flu, maybe it will become a seasonal thing like the common flu. But I sure hope and am quite confident that your predictions about corrupted immune systems and eternal lockdowns will turn out to be false. Time will tell. Let‘s come back to this post in a year and see what happened. I wish you all the best. Keep up the civil discourse.</p>

        <p>AI researcher working in healthcare here. The 95% RRR is NOT misleading. i'd argue its more relevant than the ARR of 0.7%  in this case. </p>
<p>consider this analogy. let's say i've developed a medication for a certain type of cancer affecting just 1% of the population IN A YEAR. also assume the medication is so effective that it completely cures all cases of this cancer. </p>
<p>Now the RRR would be 100% which i'd say is a better measure of its efficacy than the ARR which would be 1%. The medication is aimed at people who have a particular disease and it works perfectly. But looking at the ARR you'd think the medication barely makes a difference</p>
<p>Now, you might say forcing everyone in the population to take this medication whether or not they have this form of cancer is ineffective and draconian, since only 1% get it anyway. And you'd be right.</p>
<p>BUT, that only holds true if certain conditions are met.</p>
<p>FIRST, the prevalence of the condition has to remain the same, which is NOT the case with covid, since the infection rate can go up many fold depending on the situation. Look at what is happening in India right now. Where the absolute risk reduction would be a lot more than 0.7%</p>
<p>SECOND, the time frame. Though the probability of occurrence is 1% in a given year,  over N years, rate would be 1 - (1 - 0.01)\^N  which can compound quite quickly, and then you're looking at a much higher ARR (about 10% in 10 years)</p>
<p>To sum it up, although RRR is misused a lot in pop science literature to exaggerate risk and to drum up fear, It is relevant in some cases and should not be ignored.</p>

        <p>Hey, if you were not very eager to jump to conclusions, you'd have observed that vaccine studies range from 2 weeks to 2 months over which the RR is calculated. Which means for india ARR might range from 14 x 400,000/billion to 60 x 400,000/billion or about 5.6% to 24%. India doesnt register 400,000 per day everyday, so this is an estimate.</p>
<p>Either way, your'e missing the point. ARR doesn't tell you much about the efficacy of a targeted medication or procedure, especially when some places have strict lockdowns or similar measures to prevent cases in the first place. ARR can vary wildly depending on the situation.</p>

        <p>Firstly, im not really sure of the study spans for all of the vaccines in the US market right now. Id guess many of them would be longer than 2 weeks.
2 weeks honestly is sufficient since a large number of people are recruited, and the results are statistically significant. Which is a data scientist's way of saying the results cannot be because of chance. The reduction in the infection rates for the vaccinated group is significant and was definitely a result of taking the vaccine</p>
<p>Ultimately, i think few diseases are serious enough that everyone should be mandated to get vaccinated for them. I generally support an individuals right to decide for themselves whether to get vaccinated or not. </p>
<p>So if you decide not to get vaccinated for covid because you think you are not at risk, thats fine. But do not blindly extend that decision to every vaccine</p>

        <p>I totally agree with everything you just said.
The only nuance I might point out is that moderna disqualified 330 participants who were vaccinated and 60 who weren’t, which is 5 times as much as Pfizer. 
Enough to really mess up the RR if they wanted to fudge some data.</p>
<p>This is also the first actual product that moderna has ever released... :/</p>

        <p>I have no real idea of what is being said here other than the fact that a decrease in the risk of developing symptoms is still a decrease. So, Im still gonna take that decrease.</p>

        <p>Umm .. but u see .. this is just part of a larger picture. So you have 80 % chance to be asymtomatic if you catch the 'virus', taken into consideration that ur RT-PCR test was run at 28 or lower cycles, and not 27+  (38-56 current for unvaccinated). And then, if you do develop symptoms, you have maybe 30 % to be serious ?. And then again, if they are serious, you have a 99.9999997 % chance to survive unless the doctors kill you with intubation, lol. </p>
<p>And then again, the vaccines give you the disease, in order to make your body fight it. So you get the real symtomps instead of decreasing them.</p>
<p>So we gotta ask ourselves .. what are we decreasing ?  Maybe just your health and chance to survive other coronaviruses out there, because autum will come, and your immune system will be worn out after the vaccines, unless you keep taking them forever, the reason why they say it`s forever and they also made pills with monoclonal antibodies to replace your natural ones (because yours will be messed up)</p>

        <p>Ummmmmmmmmmmm............. but u see.......the pfizer vaccine is mRNA strands and not the virus or bacteria. It's not even a living thing. Just proteins in your body. Honestly, you just sound like a big anti-vax kinda person to me.</p>

        <p>What ?! Nuh, uh ! im far from that. Im actualy enjoying that peoples get vaccinated, i even bought mine already.The more injected, the better.I have anxiety for couple of years and crowds make me feel not great, i liked this whole pandemic thing alot bcause it was relaxed everyhere i went.So i pretty much encourage everyone to go and get vaccinated, and do it now fast, before next autum comes, to get a better result then.</p>

        <p>This sub is full of morons. You’re trying to compare absolute risk of getting covid with individuals involved in a study conducted at a time when most of the world was relatively shut down and people were wearing masks in order to somehow justify that getting the vaccine isn’t worth it or that covid isn’t really deadly after literally mountains of dead over the past year prove you wrong. I see pharma reps on here acting as if they’re experts when really they’re the same people that a few years ago pushed oxy onto the world and caused an epidemic. Listen to the CDC. They are smarter than you. You’re not some special person that uncovered a conspiracy and know more than the “sheeple”. Get a hobby if you want to feel good about yourself instead of posting or listening to the drivel on this sub. And get vaccinated. Stop being so damn selfish and stupid. Grow the hell up. Anyone that doesn’t see a big difference between the number 70 and 4 is an idiot.</p>

        <p>The most obvious is why is this coming out now? A new and novel way to bend stats to support your anti vax goals? If this was readily available where was this analysis in December?</p>
