<title>How did almost an entire generation who grew up reading/watching Harry Potter, Hunger Games, ATLA, and Divergent end up becoming cucks for the government who trust the establishment and believe all authority truly has their best interests at heart?</title>

    <strong>How did almost an entire generation who grew up reading/watching Harry Potter, Hunger Games, ATLA, and Divergent end up becoming cucks for the government who trust the establishment and believe all authority truly has their best interests at heart?</strong>
    <p><p>tl;dr - Basically, the title. These books/movies mirror real life and I don't know how people don't see it.</p>
<p>I randomly ended up watching the 3rd Hunger Games movie tonight. I haven't read/seen the entire franchise in a while, so the details are a bit fuzzy, but bear with me. </p>
<p>The parallels in that movie to what we are living now were uncanny. In the 3rd movie, the Revolution is underway, and Katniss and her team are inspiring riots to pop up all over the country. What does President Snow do? He holds a meeting with his team of advisors, deciding the best way to shut this down. They decide on using language to their advantage. He broadcasts a speech where he calls these regular people rioting against an oppressive government for their freedom "radicals" and "insurrectionists," and says how the Capitol is the most important pillar of Panem. Sound familiar? </p>
<p>And this is not meant to be a BLM vs. MAGA or red vs. blue thing. I'm done with all of that, and more people need to be, too. This race war they are pushing is entirely manufactured, as is the masks vs. "anti-mask", vaccinated vs. "anti-vax," (another example of using language to vilify a group of people) etc. They want us to fight amongst ourselves, to fight each other. They are pushing it on purpose. Why? For the exact same reason the Capitol purposely divides the districts amongst themselves so that they will fight each other instead of the government. If we all finally realized we have more in common with each other than we are different, we could unite. And then the tyrants would lose their shit. They don't want us united against them, it terrifies them. </p>
<p>But unfortunately, a massive amount of the generation who grew up idolizing Katniss Everdeen have somehow wound up entrusting their entire lives in the hands of the government, who they openly adore! Is the indoctrination in college <em>that</em> good?! How does this happen? Do these people think that governments only oppress their own people in fiction? Where do they think the authors get these ideas from? Art is based on real life. And I mean actual <em>art</em>, not the propaganda disguised as art that we constantly consume,  in the form of another Disney sequel live-action remake designed to keep your brain stagnant and not think past what you're supposed to. </p>
<p>To answer this question, I guess I can also look to the Hunger Games. When Peeta is rescued and tries to strangle Katniss, Beetee says to her, "Fear is the most difficult thing to overcome. We are hard-wired to remember it best." Well, I guess the tyrants did their homework. These best-selling YA authors wrote about inescapable technology and a police state, but none of them imagined the fear-induced coma the populace would enter due to a type of medical tyranny "for our own good." </p>
<p>I'm just at a loss. How can anyone honestly believe that these people really care about our health?</p>
<p>Honestly, go back and read your old Harry Potter books. Read about being a good friend, and doing what's right, and staying true to yourself, and being brave. The doomers' past teenage selves would probably be ashamed.</p>
<p>EDIT- Wow this blew up. Thanks everyone for your thoughts. I wish I could respond to all of you, and there’s some really good points being made here. Several of you mentioned some points that I think are especially important: </p>
<ul>
<li>The need to feel taken care of. As a child, parents take care of you. As an adult, I guess these people look to government to take care of them. A failure to recognize they are responsible for their own lives, and a naive impression that those who claim to “care for us” have no ulterior motives. </li>
<li>The idea that the hero and villain in stories are very obviously the good and bad guys right from the beginning. In real life, it’s much more convoluted and takes critical thinking to figure it out. And there might be a period of time before you wake up and realize something isn’t right. Which brings me to:</li>
<li>Schools not teaching, and openly discouraging, critical thinking. Schools and other authorities teaching and encouraging conformity above bravery. </li>
<li>Between choosing what is right and what is easy, most people will choose what is easy. </li>
<li>People buying the MSM narrative that they <em>are</em> the underdog heroes because they’re saving the world from “anti-maskers” and the other unmentionables, even though they are backed by every major corporation or establishment in the USA.</li>
</ul>
<p>EDIT 2 - Almost forgot the most important one: </p>
<p>Hard times create strong men. Strong men create good times. Good times create weak men. Weak men create hard times. </p>
<p>We’re entering the hard times, friends. Here’s to all you good people out there. May the hard times make you strong, may your love of freedom make you brave, and may we always remember who the true enemy is.</p></p>

        <p>Cuz deep down they want to be a rebel but cant. So they engage in fantasies with characters who fight the power.</p>
<p>Same reason with feminazis. Deep down they want to be dominated by a powerful man, but theyre brainwashed so instead they gravitate towards media that satiates that desire. </p>
<p>Same with the fascination with narcos and mafia dramas. Most of us live ordinary lives and have to follow rules and do things other people tell us to. But a lot of people fantasize about being a mafia don with money, power and respect, who can do whatever he wants when he wants.</p>

        <p>They think the power you give them isn’t the problem. It’s just that they want the right person/party to have that power. Personally, if I’m afraid of what the opposition can do with the power they have, then I don’t even want the people I vote for to have that power.</p>

        <p>With Marxism, The “oppressor” is an imagined enemy; a target that continually must stay out of reach but always there.  Faith in Marxism only continues when you have a scapegoat to blame for society’s problems.  That’s what we’re seeing today with the government/media labelling groups as “white supremacists”; and claiming that THEY’RE the cause of all of our problems.</p>

        <p>Majority of big artists love the system, it provides them a luxurious lifestyle they don't want to give up, and the more popularity/money they acquire, they more disconnected they become from the real world.  You know their lives didn't change that much in the last year, definitely not as much as the average American, or worse the ones who had their hours cut, were only given 2.5 stimulus checks for an entire year, and told to just hold on, we're all in this together.  Fact is no we aren't all in this together.  It's about obedience and conformity.</p>

        <p>Nice! I'm 40 yrs old and I identified with the alternative scene in the 90's.  I was a democrat until I discovered Ron Paul. Then I realized I was wrong. I grew up being resentful with Republican religion-pushing and over the top patriotism. Things have changed though. The Republican party sucks ass but they are not the establishment oppressor boggiemen anymore. It's weird to see young people way behind on this. I can understand older people thinking things haven't changed, but young people aren't getting it (for the most part) either.</p>

        <p>I haven't seen Hunger Games but I plan to so I can't speak to that but someone posted an article here a while back that was really fantastic and explained why people believe the government has their best interests at heart. It was basically saying that a lot of people seem to be in a state of Perpetual adolescence where they're looking for a parental figure to take care of them. They don't want to face reality that the world can be a very difficult shitty place. They want to believe that there's someone that's going to be looking out for them and trying to help them just like their parents did. Reality is it's not that way once you're an adult. But that kind of explains why a lot of people trust their government like they do, they really need to. They can't face a world where things are uncertain and unsafe and nobody really cares about you.</p>

        <p>I think I vaguely remember that. It makes sense and might be right, but to me that’s not a good excuse. At some point we have to grow up and realize that we’re responsible for our own lives. </p>

        <p>I found the article I had it bookmarked! Here it is for you in case you didn't get to read it the first time</p>
<p>https://reportingforbeauty.substack.com/p/on-the-psychology-of-the-conspiracy-7ff</p>
<p>I totally agree with you, a lot of these people are very childish. The way they lash out and have fits and call everyone around them an idiot or a moron if you don't agree with them. They won't even listen to you. I've actually had some extremely legitimate proof of certain things and presented it to a few people and do you know that they actually refuse to read or they will look for bias where there is none? The cognitive dissonance is absolutely amazing. They refuse to see any other viewpoints. They need to tell themselves that we are all stupid conspiracy theorists. Do you honestly think millions of people are conspiracy theorists? Like every single one of us? We're all wrong about this and we're all crazy? Seriously?! Lol</p>
<p>I'm definitely going to watch it I keep hearing about it and I need to see what it's all about!</p>

        <p>Good points. Also think about why superhero movies are everywhere nowadays. Literally programming people into believing someone else will come save the day and distorts reality. Also a lot of childish activities are acceptable and normalised for adults to consume nowadays. Like grown men being fans of superhero movies, same as playing computer games for extended amounts of time, watching porn etc. Basically any instant gratification. But it goes quite deep I think, because I think the reason adults nowadays are endulging in childish activities is because the reality of past adult way of life (buying a home, having kids, a job with security) tend to be things of the past. So for a majority of people what alternative do they have? They go for the hedonistic lifestyle because the alternative seems completely out of grasp. The worst part is, deep down they know that there way of life is not full filling yet they cant figure out whats exactly wrong.</p>

<p>Oh, come the fuck on. Many people in this sub enjoy "childish activities" and are against the tyranny. Conversely, there's many grown ups with "mature" tastes who are shoving the tyranny down everyone's throats.</p>

        <p>Yes, thats correct I worded it wrong. Its difficult to completely articulate my point through text sometimes. Also I'm not addressing tyranny at all, I'm actually addressig the point about adults living in a state of "perpetual adolescense". So my point stands. Let me make it clear for you that in my opinion over indulging in childish activities and the fact that its now socially acceptable/ normalised to do so is one of the reasons why I believe adults are living in this state. Superhero movies, playing games and porn are just a few examples I gave but thats a generalisation and what I mean is any form of medium that allows adults to escape reality for over extended times to the point it stops them wantign to face reality.</p>

        <p>Probably not popular but I say we should have 2 year mandatory military service like a lot of countries do. Get these kids to learn to be more self sufficient and quit crying about safe spaces. It made me grow up pretty fast and I don't think I'd be where I am career and money wise if I still had the weak mindset I had at 20, plus I had a good time getting out of my parents house and being around a bunch of people from all over the place with different views and backgrounds</p>

        <p>I completely agree. Maybe not force but give you benefits to doing it as far as your future opportunities. It could be highly encouraged but not mandated. Its about more than serving government it's a wake up call to being self sufficient, strong, accepting that a lot of life is doing things you don't really want to do to be a responsible adult with a work ethic. I have known people who were sent to military schools by their parents to help shape them into responsible adults and every single one of them was transformed in a good way. You don't always get what you want in life and it's not easy. People are overgrown babies now. Not a popular opinion but too bad. I would have served if it was required when I was young and I wouldn't have even thought to complain about it. I had friends in HS long ago who were in ROTC and they loved it, they excelled in academics and sports. I think structure and discipline are unfamiliar to people now.</p>

        <p>This is one of the reasons, along with the government giving incessant propaganda on how following what they say is actually the <em>right thing</em> and everyone else is either a crazy person or a terrorist.</p>
<p>So in those scenarios you either believe daddy government that's in the meantime praising you for being a good little soldier, or you question everything you were led to believe so far. Easy choice for most people. Only very few people have the strength to open pandora's box and put everything into question. Complacency is the root of all evil.</p>

        <p>Learned helplessness is the term you're looking for - Eric Weinstein has talked about this some; his podcast is called The Portal on YouTube - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR85PW_B_7_Aisx5vNS7Gjw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR85PW_B_7_Aisx5vNS7Gjw</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ericrweinstein">twitter.com/ericrweinstein</a></p>
<p>This is also the reason Jordan Peterson has gained fame as an intellectual and tries to teach people to voluntarily take on the burden, weight, of responsibility - first start by cleaning your room/getting your own shit together before you try to fix the global economy, etc; his last 2 books being 12 Rules for Life and Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life.</p>
<p>Edit to add: JP also points out that people used to lean on, or need to to some degree because the world is complex, and that institution used to heavily be religion (whether authentic or indoctrinated/ideology) - and now it perhaps is government/politics as ideology or any other number of ideologies. He's concerned about what replaces the role religion had in the Western world.</p>

        <p>Honestly... this post hit me like a brick!</p>
<p>I've just started working as a teaching assistant in a secondary school and the kids are currently learning about dystopian societies- hunger games, divergent and maze runner!!</p>
<p>They (12-13 Yr olds) are learning about how to recognise components of dystopian societies in literature, such as "propaganda" and "citizens living in fear", while sat in a class room... in masks... with signs everywhere promoting safe covid guidelines... having to put chemicals on their hands everytime they leave and enter the room!</p>
<p>I worry about what the cognitive dissonance will do to these kids brains. 
Like, Imagine living in a movie set and you are the only one that sees the cameras 👀</p>

        <p>Because of those very fictional storylines. The 20-40 crowd was trained to think that dystopian societies only happen in fiction or a long time ago, and that it’s only ever brought about by the right wing, never the left, and certainly never by shadowy organizations of the mega-rich (something that we’ve also been trained to reflexively deride as fodder for crazy conspiracy theories).</p>

        <p>I kind of liken what's happening right now to Korra season 1's storyline with Amon. The "charismatic" leader (Biden, Fauci, Gates, any and every one of the world leaders, etc) trying to purposefully divide the populace, and using propaganda. TLOK didn't write that storyline very good and it got resolved way too quickly, in my opinion, but still.</p>

        <p>Part of it is "hero syndrome" --- the idea that someone special will come along and save everything.</p>
<p>But in reality, there are no "heroes" - just a bunch of Redditors fighting for freedom <em>one word at a time.</em></p>
<p>I'm kidding. On a more serious note, what it comes down to is power. They have it, and we don't.</p>
<p>We don't have power because we are divided. Politically, racially, economically, and otherwise... </p>
<p>They have capital. Money is power.</p>
<p>The only way to defeat power is with a collective, but our school system teaches conformity, compliance, consumerism, and worship-of-capitalism.</p>
<p>The end result is the average person will speak out more for the rights of someone with infinite wealth than their own. This is by design, and we see it all the time here at /r/nonewnormal even.</p>
<p>One example is the government-corporate collusion (i.e. Mussolini's economic fascism) leading to censorship.</p>
<p>We still have people here saying, "A business has the right to do what it wants!" Because these people can't understand the difference between the 'freedom' of a small business owner and a corporation big enough that it's financially larger than most governments.</p>
<p>Bottom line -- hero syndrome, lack of critical thinking skills thanks to a deliberately broken public education system, and worship of capital.</p>
<p>That's your answer.</p>

Small towns are changing and instead of small businesses all they will have is a Walmart and fast food chains. Then the handful of people in charge of those companies have all the power.</p>

        <p>It's all part of the programming.</p>
<p>People love to think that they're the underdog, just look at all the hoops people jump through to try to claim they're oppressed, or how people go and march for causes that are unanimously supported by the establishment. For those kind of people there's never actually any critical thought that goes into consuming that type of dystopian media. The most they ever get out of it is "Woah, authoritarian governments bad" without ever considering what that means. By the time someone is old enough to properly appreciate that type of media, the conditioning is already so strong that they'll just read whatever they want into it. People's biases destroy any nuance that was there and just reinforce their beliefs that it's noble and valiant to "fight the good fight" and stand up to the man/the government/the corporations etc. etc.</p>
<p>It simply becomes a lens to project their own worldview through. This is why you constantly see <em>every side</em> say "oh my god, this is LiTeRaLlY 1984" to anything they disagree with.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure how Harry Potter fits into your examples for your point, OP, but I absolutely agree that a generation that grew up with Hunger Games, Divergent and the darker aspects of ATLA should have known better than to trust the government mandates that got insidious over time.</p>

        <p>Yes. If I remember correctly (Sorry HP Fans) 
They're either so scared that they turn into evil doers themselves, or just in Team BadGuys.
The school system takeover I was referring to:
Hogwarts is led by a member of the resistance, and one of the only matches to Voldemort. The Ministry (state) sends a woman that ends up replacing him, because he's accused of training an army. She forbids the use of magic, and particularly defensive spells (she takes the guns away).. HP and friends proceed to build a secret school within Hogwarts, and train everyone for the inevitable war to come. </p>
<p>Anyway spoiler alert HP wins and the lady (Himmler) ends up locked up for life because she also was the main architect of a genocide against HalfBreeds(Non-Aryans)  </p>
<p>Sorry again HP fans.</p>
<p>Great story, all in all. A little shallow and too easily reminiscent of N Germany sometimes. But hey, great source of inspiration.</p>

        <p>I always avoided the series because it seemed just so boring to me. But this interpretation definitely creates some intrigue now. So I may consider watching it in the future</p>

        <p>That generation you speak of was raised (using Harry Potter as an example) to see Trump as Lord Voldemort. And in war, sacrifices must be made.</p>
<p>The lack of knowledge on the one hand, plus a good story on the other. It makes enough sense to them and thats it. Once you believe you fight the good fight, there is no room for second guessing.</p>
<p>When you take hunger games, as an example, the bad guy again was framed to be Trump. He was using these techniques, trying to surpress the BLM movement, changing the term global warming to climate change, even calling it a hoax... </p>
<p>The issue with those movies is, that there is always one bad and one good side. As such they dont represent reality, but make it easy for anyone to consider his side the good one and therefore the other side as the bad one.</p>

        <p>OR these books and movies were projected to to the fore front of pop culture to jade and dilude us to the idea of these type of events happening. It's all programming for one reason or another and now how convenient is it that when any of us bring up the parallels between those works of fiction and reality it's instantly shot down as "harumpf, those are just fantasy and stories...that will never happen you're crazy".</p>

        <p>Well, one of the steady messages in all the books you mentioned is that such control is possible only in isolated systems. </p>
<p>Everything from Ministry of Magic to Panem functions that way because they are the only government in the setting. That is not the case in real world. </p>
<p>Let us assume US govt is trying to control people using covid as an excuse.  How can that explain the lockdowns and deaths in other countries? How about the deaths in India where the govt has a vested interest in downplaying the pandemic? </p>
<p>Wouldn't one of US' ideological enemies call them out? Say Putin or the Chinese govt, wouldn't they leap at the chance to discredit US?</p>

<p>Because this is a global takeover. All the world leaders are in on this. They want a "One World Government". They don't want to downplay the pandemic, they want to keep fueling more and more fear to the masses in order to initiate more control, and to reset the economy and social order. </p>
<p>It sounds "like fiction", but it's very much what is happening.</p>

        <p>Sorry, but I find that extremely difficult to buy. There are too many ideological differences. </p>
<p>For a global takeover to be feasible, in fiction or in real life, there must be a shared ideology. Right now, the ideologies of world leaders are too different to allow cooperation, forget conspiracy between them. There's only so far that thirst for power will take you.</p>

        <p>The "shared ideology" is a one world nation that they can all watch and rule over. They've been dropping hints about this for a long time now. The idea is for the entire world to be governed under the same rules and societal standards, which they believe will bring about a "utopia" (well, more like it'll be easier for them to watch and control people).</p>

        <p>Problem - societal standards. How will those be agreed on - India's ruling party's societal standards is wildly opposed to US democrats. Both are contrary to China's or the UAE's. It is impossible to reconcile, as the world stands now. </p>
<p>You can imagine the first world nations coming together to take over the rest of the world, or Russia and China uniting in their communism, or some such birds of a feather flocking together. But the kind of eclectic coalition you are proposing... No way.</p>

        <p>I bet if I had told you in January 2020 that the world was going to lockdown in March and the restrictions would last over a year, you would probably say "No way! That'd never happen!". Truth is often stranger than fiction, as they say.</p>

        <p>Yes, but in truth or fiction, there has to be some kind of logic.  A pandemic is something that can logically happen. A lockdown is a realistic way to deal with a pandemic - everyone accepts that. What is being questioned in this sub is whether Covid is serious enough to merit such a lockdown. </p>
<p>However, for a global conspiracy of the kind you are describing to happen, a lot of powerful people and societies will have to act in an extremely uncharacteristic and coordinated fashion. Besides, well, honestly, if all world govts decided to bring about a global world order and is capable of acting in perfect coordination with each other in the way you propose, they wouldn't need a pandemic as a cover story. </p>
<p>They can just declare it, and there would be nothing anyone can do about it. Of course, some may protest, but the kind of military response such a global govt can call in would slam down any rebellion faster than you can blink. </p>
<p>In normal warfare - civil war or not - govts are operating under constraints. For example in the Vietnam war, US could drop a nuke or just some of the higher grade bombs and win completely. They didn't do it because they were aware of the retaliation that action would invite from other world powers. Israel and Hamas are likewise constrained by other world powers, no matter how much they try to deny it. A govt freed of any such restraint is going to be a juggernaut no one can stand against. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If there was such global cooperation, there would be no coverstory, just outright takeover.</p>

        <p>Because they think they're worthless and have no say in the matter.</p>
<p>They don't bother reading studies themselves as they don't think they're worthy of understanding of they don't have a degree. So they trust those that do.</p>
<p>Meanwhile they push for selfish policies such as debt forgiveness and a higher mininum wage as they don't think they can get out of the holes they put themselves in, and don't think they're worth enough to earn a raise, and as a result want the government to force their employer to give them a raise.</p>
<p>They are taught to attribute all bad things to those more successful than themselves, but don't understand shades of Grey, only black and white. So the local Asian convenience store owner is just as bad as Jeff Bezos and as a result shoplifting is "sticking it to the man". </p>
<p>Then they make up issues that don't exist in order to fight for it. Just look at how they're reacting to the Capitol riot, while ignoring it was only 200 or so people out of nearly a million in the area.</p>

        <p>Youth don't rebel anymore. Boomers seized so much power, and money, and well if you get in a fist fight in school you get a year of juvenile and a criminal record unlike times past. They made it so you couldn't make a living, I am disabled today from poverty in my 20s and lack of decent medical care or insurance. I worked my ass off too and once had a 90 hour scheduled workweek, but the world is a cold hard place, and they reminded me of that every day. I was Gen X.

        <p>Well, while I dont know everything, Im gonna try to answer the question. Be warned it will have at least 1 flaw.</p>
<ol>
<li>30 year olds are millennials. Most millennials are progressive which is fine, but the majority of millennial progressives are the type of progressive that wants the government to do the progressing. The media sources they watch and read push radical positions and extremity as something good, right? Extremity when it comes to politics is basically seeing the world in black and white. The media sources they consume feed them this type of extreme progress but only a small tidbit of it. those same sources do not push any other types. You dont see CNN begging for a communist America, do you? All the progress they push is what the government only can do. THAT makes people go into a kid-type state thinking "if the government does it for me everyhting will be beter :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD". They start thinking of the government as something to bend to their will, when their will is the medias(at least the media they watch) manufactured will.</li>
<li>So, if they want the government to progress and they're radical about it, that is a perfect storm for pure, unfiltered obedience to the vaccine. Celebrities also come into factor here. Since role models are so heavily pushed on in the media in general, and celebrities are basically that (look at this guy who contributed to society by singing songs! :D) if a celebrity gets the vaccine, that pushes support for it. Celebrities and influencers are more influential then one would think.</li>
<li>The world is metaphorically, grey. Pure grey. Some bits of white and black here and there but its just grey. However if you see everything in black and white its easier for other people to manipulate you and control you, then pit you against other people who see the black and white as a different thing. So yeah.</li>

        <p>Those books/movies were popular because people subconsciously feel oppressed by the System and powerless to stop it. But the System is incredibly good at twisting people's impulses toward rebellion and subverting them towards its own ends. How many people who participated in the BLM marches thought they were fighting the System? How many cheered when all of the media colluded to silence Trump? How many think they're helping to defeat climate change by eating ze bugs?</p>
<p>The perverse reality is that the System is actually helped to progress forward by people who think they're fighting against it.</p>

        <p>It's actually quite simple why people fell for all of this when we have such history and fictional literature at our disposal to warn against it:</p>
<p>A person is smart, but people are stupid. Imagine for a moment that you have a good job, you make enough money that you and your family are comfortable, and your career is moving toward an ever-more fulfilling role in your life. Now, imagine the threat by "collective society" (in quotes because it's actually a minority - about 12~ish percent) that says if you don't adhere to this particular set of moral standards you lose everything. The vast majority of people don't like what's going on, but the average person prefers stability over all else. They want only for their comfortable lives to continue.</p>
<p>These are people who don't know true hardship. It's one of the failings of a successful society during a golden age. "Good times make weak men." That's why you hear things from the mob like "words are violence". Imagine for a moment a group of people so soft that they haven't actually seen real violence. The most hurtful thing they've ever experienced are harsh words. That is the vast majority of the people who believe in this bizarre neo-marxist-wokeism.</p>
<p>It manifests in many ways. The west in general, but the US specifically at one time truly was the shining beacon upon a hill. That was our golden age. That golden age has passed and we are now entering a dark age. We can look to history to see that at the end of a golden age new and extreme ideologies arise, governments become more authoritarian as the establishment politicians let out their death-rattle as they lose control of the State to the people. This is what we are experiencing now.</p>
<p>The west will continue, but we will not be the world's pre-eminent cultural power. That day may come again, but for now... "Harsh times make strong men."</p>

        <p>Mmm agree op, but it all depends on how much brains you have as a viewer.</p>
<p>Hollywood has been flaunting it in our faces for a long, long time. Well, either flaunting it or warning us, or both, as some producers have come out and basically said. One of the hunger games producers, in fact.</p>
<p>And not just that. I genuinely think the direction our fiction takes as a culture has an impact on what people physically manifest in their lives. In a post modern society, necessity is no longer the mother of invention and people are free to invent things (and situations) which they could only have imagined previously. We manifest our reality. If we imagine the future will consist of inescapable technology, we'll probably walk that direction. If we decide we're going to stop the rising against a post modern tyranny before it starts then we need to start resisting now.</p>

        <p>I totally agree. These are great points you’ve brought up. I used to think it was just the cycle of changing trends that made the whole era of post apocalyptic and dystopian fiction disappear that was so popular in the 2010s. But now I actually think Hollywood and TPTB wouldn’t allow these kinds of books/movies to be made anymore. Too risky that someone might see where we’re headed and decide to do something. </p>
<p>As a side note, I really wish we <em>hadn’t</em> imagined a world of inescapable technology. Honestly the shit we have now scares me, and we were better off before it all. Technology has reached a point where it’s more harm than good.</p>

        <p>Absolutely. They took a step back instead. And I agree, it isn't just a trend or coincidence, there are people out there in Hollywood and otherwise who know there's forces of evil out there, consciously or not.</p>
<p>I think the thought experiment is important though. If we can imagine a modern tyrannical society, we should, and take those uncomfortable steps to prevent it. And while I agree technology has reached a point of hindrance, I don't think technology itself is evil. Just how we use it. I can think of a million things that would help make society what we wish it would be, and a million things we really shouldn't be using technology for. Tech has always kind of fascinated me. Anyways, leading by example / individual responsibility is a major part too. The more people start using tech in a new way, and get away from its limitations, the more we can transfer over to the next new thing - whatever comes after post modern.</p>

        <p>It's a very subtle conditioning. Those anti-government triggers only work if the the government is presented as evil..by an authority figure.</p>

        <p>I could probably talk for some time about how Harry Potter is quite a quintessence of neoliberal worldview. Regarding other dystopian teen fiction, it has always struck me as rather simplistic when who is the villain and who is the hero is pretty obvious right from the beginning. Real life tyranny has to be recognized first and moustaches twirling baddies are usually just a small part of a large, dysfunctional society.</p>

        <p>Look up the Zaygarnic effect, human brains compartmentalize very well, in different settings you are almost a different person "government bad, freedom good" when watching movies "Government good, freedom bad" when supporting their parties, is how the human brain works because human psychology is highly context dependent</p>

        <p>As I see it, those people who didn't agreed in government during their adolescence end up there because they want to change it.</p>
<p>But it is very hard to change those things, we are having hard times even changing our own ways.</p>
<p>So they end up unmotivated and gave up on their goals. Also, the problem is, that old people basically want to stay in those positions to the last possible moment.</p>
<p>These factors are, IMHO, the reason why society isn't improving as it should. We simply are stuck in the world of strong leaders who want THEIR truth, with every way possible.</p>
