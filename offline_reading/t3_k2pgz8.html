    <strong>My friend is a total doomer in a crappy environment - help!</strong>
    <p><p>Hey,</p>
<p>So I’m trying to meet up with one of my best friends, but unfortunately, he’s a massive doomer because his mom has diabetes. So whenever I want to meet up with him, he insists on masks &amp; social distancing, but because he’s basically the only friend that talks to me at least semi-regularly, &amp; I don’t have an abundance of friends like all my peers magically do, I don’t have the heart to tell him how I really feel. Also, he’s a genuinely good guy (though he tends to gossip) &amp; treats me well, so I want to keep him around.</p>
<p>Worse, though I find it easy to meet &amp; approach new people, I can’t maintain contact with them because I kinda suck at it, &amp; they all act holier than thou, &amp; I have limiting beliefs. I’m anxious no one would want to hang out with me because I’m a loser &amp; its COVID, &amp; I’m also anxious that the moment I tell my parents I’m doing something social, they’ll interrogate me about it to no end. To put this in perspective, in LATE JANUARY, when I told my parents I was going back to the gym, they told me, “if you bring COVID home &amp; kill us, because you will, that’s on you.” They also said this when they caught me trying to meet girls on Tinder in April, &amp; whenever I basically try to get out of the house for anything explicitly social. My parents have pre-emptively blamed their COVID deaths on me. That’s fucked up.</p>
<p>I hate this toxicity. These are levels of toxicity, bullying, hypocrisy &amp; ignorance I haven’t seen since middle school (they let themselves go out unrestricted, but when I try to do the same, they fucking pile on me). I’d move out, but I’m unemployed, &amp; finding a job that pays living wage in my city (Toronto) is an impossibility. I’m 24. I’m tired of being lonely, both socially &amp; sexually. I’m tired of being an incel loser, but I feel like TPTB have left me no way out, &amp; that everyone in the world is conspiring against me to keep me down. I feel like the only people that can succeed now are those who were already massively successful, &amp; that I’ll never be able to have the life of my dreams, or experience love or friendship, or just anything that makes life worth living because the rest of my time here will be an apocalyptic war zone where I’ll literally be against the world. I’m also a huge worrier, so any escape plan would need ways for me to ease my fears &amp; anxiety &amp; build courage &amp; confidence. I’m in therapy &amp; it’s helping, but I hate this world and its hypocrisies. Help me.</p></p>

        <p>Dude I know it’s hard but you need to find a job and move out. </p>
<p>Your parents pre-emptively blaming you for their death is extremely fucked up and WRONG (even if you did give it to them, it wouldn’t be your fault)</p>

        <p>You’ve gotta be a little bit self aware if you’re willing to admit you have limiting beliefs. Are you interested in getting rid of them and adopting a more powerful set of beliefs that actually serve you?</p>

        <p>I hate to be so harsh here but 24 and still living with your parents is not good.  You need to be living your own independent life and you shouldn't be subjected to your parents toxicity.  I'm sure there are financial reasons for living with them but whatever the reason, it's not worth it and you should find a way to get your own place.</p>

        <p>Stay friend with the doomer but respect his rules. We all know it's Bs but the propaganda has been going on for 9 months. When everything is back to normal just tell him that you got the vaccine so he doesn't freak out.</p>

        <p>Be the one with some balls. If he can’t handle that about you, he was never really a friend. Tell him he’s wrong to be so afraid. Not speaking up is why we’re here.</p>
