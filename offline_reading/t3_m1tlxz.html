<title>Read this this morning which was hugely encouraging to me. Some of you here may need this too, as my journey over the last few months (as it has for many of us), uncovering the truth of all this insanity, has been very painful. Just wanted to encourage.</title>

    <p><p>Psalm 43 NKJV</p>
<p>Vindicate me, O God,
And plead my cause against an ungodly nation;
Oh, deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man!
2 For You are the God of my strength;
Why do You cast me off?
Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
3 Oh, send out Your light and Your truth!
Let them lead me;
Let them bring me to Your holy hill
And to Your tabernacle.
4 Then I will go to the altar of God,
To God my exceeding joy;
And on the harp I will praise You,
O God, my God.
5 Why are you cast down, O my soul?
And why are you disquieted within me?
Hope in God;
For I shall yet praise Him,
The help of my countenance and my God.</p></p>

<p>Right now, the devil is the ruler of this world.</p>
<p>A lot of the diseases and a lot of the problems we have in this world is because those at the top know very well who they're working for. (There was someone from South America found dead right before he wanted to publish his book about preventing / curing cancer. TPTB have no interest in these solutions, unless it benefits <em>them</em>.)</p>

        <p>The majority of people have the ability to think of the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Who am I?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where am I? What am I doing here?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who/what created me? Who/what created the animals? What about the rest of nature?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The majority of people don't 'just' get born and then have a mindset of 'alright, this is all just what it is, let's just do this and then die after a while.'</p>
<p>Only those who don't have the ability to do so are automatically on God's side. (For example little kids and those who are mentally handicapped.)</p>
<p>It is God alone who can truly see into the hearts of people. (Proverbs 21:2 and Luke 16:15) Deuteronomy 1:39, "Moreover, your little ones whom you said would become a prey, and your children who at this time cannot discern between good and evil, they shall enter Canaan, and to them I will give it and they shall possess it."</p>
