        <p>It’s pre crime as long as we believe that unknowingly passing a virus to someone who then passes it to someone who then passes it to someone who then passes it to someone, who then goes to see grandma and passes it to her and she dies means that everyone in the passing game is a murderer who is complicit in a crime (except the person who actually passed it to grandma, they’ll just go online and write a diatribe blaming all those people in the passing game before them).</p>
<p>And yeah, this seems to be where the zeitgeist is headed in clown town.</p>

        <p>Here's how I explained it recently.</p>
<p>Imagine I have a stomach bug, common ailment. I am not throwing up yet and haven't noticed my fever. I have my mother over for a day and that night text her I'm sick.</p>
<p>No one expects her to not go to work because she was with me before I knew I was sick.</p>
<p>She works with a vulnerable population (all/most have permanent tracheostomies).. but she also has a family, mine included.</p>
<p>I was unknowingly shedding the stomach virus and she contracts it, takes it to work and a person in her care gets it. Vomiting is particularly dangerous for them due to their medical tube and they aspirate the vomit, get an infection and die.</p>
<p>We know it's ultimately "my" fault, but no one has never tried to shame me, charge me with manslaughter, whatever. This is just an unfortunate, terrible death due to a stomach bug that no one purposefully spread. Even the person who left the germs for me to pick up. </p>
<p>Why is COVID different ? Why are we now all held accountable for the health of strangers ?</p>

        <p>They want it. </p>
<p>They are already putting people who are infected but not signing documents promising to quarantine on house arrest (kentucky on March or April, including putting her husband that hadn't gone to the doctor/been asked to quarantine on house arrest), a man who didn't abide by group number rules on jail for 1 year (after letting those in jail out due to Covid danger - Maryland).</p>
<p>Ohio is promising 90 days in jail for not abiding by curfew laws starting Thursday IIRC.</p>

        <p>But then someone here would of passed this stomach flu onto you. There is a chain but at some point in that chain of someone wore a mask lowering the chances of passing it on then this entire chain would have not existed. There is a difference between the people in this chain that got it through bad luck and even after taking precautions passed it on vs ppl that throw precautions to the wind and spread it</p>

        <p>nope, I'm not a disease expert by any means. Nor do i claim to be.  I'd appreciate it if you'd stop putting words in my mouth to make whatever point you're hoping to make.   </p>
<p>Remember the AIDS epidemic? how MTV was like "WEAR A CONDOM" and it worked?  </p>
<p>And now most of us wear condoms, and it isn't an assault on our freedom?   </p>
<p>Or like...during that salmonella outbreak, when everyone was like "avoid lettuce" and so we all avoided lettuce and told our friends and family not to eat lettuce?   </p>
<p>It's similar to that, except now people who dont show symptoms are spreading a disease to people who will literally die if they get it, just from sitting next to them on the train! And all they have to do when they sit next to that person is wear a mask.</p>

        <p>When did I say anything about eating lettuce or wearing a condom?</p>
<p>There are viruses that hit every year and kill people every single year.  I mean, if the 57,000 people aged 50 and up that died due to influenza in the United States during the 2017-2018 flu season could have eaten lettuce and lived then I can see your point.  Unfortunately, even with a vaccine, they had no chance of surviving.  No amount of lettuce or condom wearing could have saved their lives.  That's a lot of people in one flu season.  It killed like 80,000 in total which means it also killed another 23,000 people who were under the age of 50.   That's a lot of deaths for a virus that has a vaccine.</p>
<p>Do you have any sympathy at all for these people?  Did you then?  Or does your cavalier attitude towards those who don't eat lettuce or wear a condom extend to people who die to influenza?</p>
<p>Just show me some concern for people who die of causes other than covid.</p>

        <p>i'm having a hard time relating to your perspecive. aids is an epidemic. coronavirus is a pandemic. Therefore the risk is higher than "a disease that happens every year". i think until you realize that seasonal flu ≠ the black plague we're just not gonna see eye to eye.</p>

        <p>I don't know any other way to say it than, "I don't care about the classification of a virus."</p>
<p>I really don't.  It has nothing to do with what I'm asking to see.  It doesn't concern me at all.  You could be describing the molecular difference between a peach and a nectarine and I would find way more interest in that than I would over whether or not a virus is classified as a pandemic.</p>

        <p>so the answer is that you don't give a shit about anyone dying- just about covid numbers.  Just admit that you're as unfeeling and as uncaring as the rest of us.  Just admit it.</p>
<p>Also, I don't know how many fucking times we can tell you that fake case numbers from over cycled PCR tests don't fucking matter to ANY of us.  No, we don't care that the guy who was shot in the head tested positive for covid and thus was classified as a covid death.  No, I don't care about the 97 year old who died because he smoked a pack a day for the last 70 years was classified as a covid death.  No I don't care about the woman who died of liver disease tested positive for covid and thus was classified as a covid death.</p>
<p>Got it?  I only care a little about people who ACTUALLY died of covid and that's a much smaller number.  That number is on par with all of the other viruses and I care just as much about them as I do about those who actually died of covid-19- which is very little.</p>

        <p>I don’t know if you’re projecting or not. But one of my neighbors died. He was a very nice man and he was taken too soon. I cared about him. </p>
<p>Also, something to consider is that If you have HIV. The virus doesn’t kill you. Your compromised immune system isn’t able to fight common diseases and then you die. Your official cause of death is still HIV. </p>
<p>Viruses rarely kill you, they sort of hack your body so that it’s easier for other shit to kill you.</p>

        <p>Because HIV isn’t shrouded in misinformation. Your opinion about it doesn’t matter. The facts and science are there and it’s an apt metaphor for how we talk about coronavirus.</p>

        <p>Gotcha. So it’s only “over” in New York? Because Oklahoma City is already at capacity right now. Do you think that could have been avoided with social distancing measures?</p>

        <p>All you said is that you don’t care about deaths and you don’t care about classifications and that corona hits once and the flu hits every year. </p>
<p>There are hospitals in Oklahoma City AT CAPACITY which means people with anaphylaxis or other life threatening emergencies may not get the care they need to survive because coronavirus has clogged up their hospitals. But you do not care?</p>
<p>And I’m confused. Being rude is a choice and you’ve been nothing but awful towards me. Im trying my hardest to see from your perspective.</p>

        <p>That source does not seem trustworthy. They literally have an article below stating that Trump won the election. After the mask mandates were made people started to go out more which got more people infected. Some cloth mask do not work at all but, some do. Surgical mask do really well at blocking respiratory droplets from leaving your body. Yes the virus can travel by air but if your social distancing that shouldn’t be much of a problem. They stated giving mask to the vulnerable, that won’t protect them from getting the virus because that’s not how mask work. Mask aren’t perfect but it’s better than nothing during these trying times.</p>

        <p>Stating that Trump has won is in no way unreasonable since Mail in voting is banned in many countries due to the fact that they found an increase in voter fraud.   But we’re definetly just supposed to take the medias word for it that Biden has won </p>

<p>"Masks aren't perfect but they're better than nothing"</p>
<p>There are better masks than cloth or surgical masks and if you really cared, you'd be wearing a more expensive N-95 mask and you'd replace it every few hours with a brand new one.  That crumpled up cloth or surgical mask in your pocket isn't fooling anyone.  You don't care about the health of others anymore than we do.</p>

        <p>Right, so then just fuck what the WHO recommends? Fuck the Yale study that showed the droplet count went down while wearing a mask. Because one article from the federalist is more accountable and reputable than them. So then doctors who preform surgeries shouldn’t wear masks either because it does nothing? </p>
