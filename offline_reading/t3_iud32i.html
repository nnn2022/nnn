    <strong>This whole thing feels like season 5 of The Wire.</strong>
    <p><p>If you've ever seen The Wire (please do, it's the greatest show ever made), what's happening with covid right now feels a lot like how things played out in season 5. All the politicians at this point know what's going on now is total BS and built on lies, but they are all trying to save face and not admit that they screwed up. And all the hysteria was built on a fake concern for the homeless (opposed to old people) and trying to save face. And it was all fueled by media manipulation. There are so many similarities. Damn, the Wire is so good.</p></p>
