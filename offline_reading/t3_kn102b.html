    <strong>Spread the word on Ivermectin</strong>
    <p><p>I recently responded to a comment about ivermectin and I believe this may be the place to ask for this "miracle" drug to get more exposure.</p>
<p>Ivermectin, proven to obliterate the virus in 48 hours. If there's anything that should be shared with friend and family, especially those who get sick and are sick, it's this extremely cheap and widely available drug. I'll keep it short and sweet, this drug will save lives and <em>cue the doom music</em> flatten the curve in 48 hours.</p>
<p>Please I just ask that some personal research is done into this drug and get this information to whomever might be sick with the virus right now. </p>
<p>For your consideration and research purposes:</p>
<p>From a doctor in a team, well worth the watch https://youtu.be/Tq8SXOBy-4w</p>

        <p>All the info Dr. Pierre Korry and his group have compiled: https://covid19criticalcare.com/</p>
<p>It's worth noting that in order for the vaccine to have approved for emergency use, they had to show there were no effective therapies.  There is an ongoing effort to censor Ivermectin but Dr. Pierre Korry et al have been doing an incredible job bringing the evidence to light.</p>

        <p>I think the most telling part, is that even if it is 100% ineffective placebo, it's cheap, easy to get, and has few (if any) side effects.   </p>
<p>But somehow we're supposed to ignore all that I guess and just assume it's pure concentrated evil because we're told to.</p>

        <p>Given the studies that are already out about it, it seems far already from being a placebo.</p>
<p>But yeah, I don't get the witch hunt against it... The excuse: No evidence? Then fund some studies!</p>

        <p>Same as hydroxychloroquine. Dirt cheap, and very safe. Yet theyâ€™ve demonized it as the most toxic poison you could possibly put in your body. Yet my 63 year old sickly father with Lupus has been on it for years, and it has saved his life.</p>

        <p>I think it was on The Highwire show someone commented recently that Hydroxychloroquine + Azithromycin + Zinc (taken early on - very important) is still slightly better than Ivermectin.</p>
<p>Not an expert on this but I followed the story back in May/June before and after all the censorship.</p>
<p>The HCQ trials - Recovery and Solidarity (or just one of them I can't remember) were absolutely using the drug the wrong way. Giving huge doses to late stage covid patients. Smaller treatments as early as possible, is the correct use, and with Azithromycin and Zinc.</p>
<p>Here's an excellent overview of how HCQ was misused then dismissed (Meryl Nass):</p>
<p><a href="https://anthraxvaccine.blogspot.com/2020/06/how-false-hydroxychloroquine-narrative.html">https://anthraxvaccine.blogspot.com/2020/06/how-false-hydroxychloroquine-narrative.html</a></p>
<p>Edit: Whichever one is more effective I think we'd all agree doctors should be given the choice of how best to treat their patients (not be denied access to safe, long used drugs as happened with HCQ).</p>
<p>And not have promising treatments systematically censored due to political or financial interests.</p>

        <p>Mark Rippetoe from Starting Strength <a href="https://youtu.be/SmekJtYuqcE?t=3361">talked about this in his latest weekly podcast.</a> Took me by surprise because prior to this, I never heard of Ivermectin and this bit came on as I was driving down the road, so I'm just as surprised to see you all talking about the same topic here. That link takes you to the clip at the timestamp I've also transcribed here.</p>
<p>&rt;So, uh, this is real, real important. This is a thing that I have not seen discussed AT ALL in the media, or anybody. We started talking about the use of Ivermectin back in March because there was some early indications that Ivermectin was a relatively potent anti-viral medication. Much more effective than the standard anti-virals like Acyclovir and Famiciclovir and those things that are hideously expensive, bullshit medications that have been prescribed for herpes simplex for decades now.</p>
<p>&rt;And Ivermectin showed great promise as a theoretical treatment for this thing. There are several important studies out on Ivermectin now that showed that they have, in some cases, 80% effectiveness in terms of prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19. Eighty percent!</p>
<p>&rt;Now, here's my anecdotal report for you. And of course, this is anecdotal, so it's not really "data" as the peer-reviewed people like to point out. Friend of mine end of last week called me from Salt Lake City and said <em>"Oh my God, we've all got covid. Wife's sick, I feel like shit, kids are sick, we've all tested positive."</em> And I said <em>"I know you have some Ivermectin,"</em> because I'd already talked to him about it. He had some at the shop. I said <em>"Have you give everybody the Ivermectin yet?"</em> and he said <em>"No."</em></p>
<p>&rt;I said <em>"You fucking idiot. Go to the shop. Get the Ivermectin. Put 12.5mg on the end of your finger and stick in in your mouth, and do that for everybody else in the house. Shut up and go do it. How sick is the woman and how sick do you want her to be? Is this not worth a 15-minute drive to see what's gonna happen?"</em></p>
<p>&rt;So, 8 people in his household that he's intimately associated with all tested positive. That was on a Friday, because all of this transpired on Thursday. Today, all of them are back at work. Without symptoms.</p>
