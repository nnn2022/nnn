    <strong>Does it make you feel uncomfortable the way the vaccines are given in phases related to age and disability? The most ‘useless’ people get called in first. That makes it easier to give them a more deadly shot.</strong>
    <p><p>In the UK, they want to vaccinate all of the disabled children, that would make it all too easy to send tainted and lethal batches for them, if a known eugenicist like Bill Gates or Boris Johnson had influence over the distribution.
First they went to the care homes, they could easily be giving more deadly batches at that stage, same for over 80s, then by the time they get down to the 20s and 30s, they could give out some saline placebos or perhaps something to reduce fertility. The way it’s been setup does seem like a red flag.
Even if you are someone who doesn’t think this is the case, does it concern you that they could be doing this? Some people trust and others don’t, but it is the same people who profit from war who also have influence over the pandemic vaccine program. Are these the people we should trust with our health?</p></p>

        <p>There is a risk/benefit analysis that we should all do.  For me the risk of covid is so low any benefit from the vaccine is not worth the risks.</p>

        <p>This. </p>
<p>Everyone should be weighing their own risks. To put out a blanket statement of everyone should be vaccinated, it's safe for all, is just foolish and intentionally misleading. </p>
<p>Also, anyone blindly taking the vaccine because CNN says oylr they saw a post on SM saying "do your part", is equally as foolish.</p>
<p>We're only 7 months into this trial, people. Everyone should at a minimum, be sceptical.</p>

        <p>Yes, that was right out of an authoritarian play book... Imagine if it was an actual life threatening disease and government gets to decide who's essential and who isn't? That was so eye opening, they won't even let us buy the vaccine, it's only obtainable through government, woah</p>

        <p>But it seems the vax is way more dangerous for the younger people, or it acts faster.</p>
<p>Also, there is now an incredible push to vax all young adults by preventing non-vaxed to attend night scene, which is the key mating ritual at that age.</p>
<p>But perhaps most importantly, with limiting recepients to age groups they created (fake) scarcity. And what is scarce is usually wanted. I know a guy who found a way to get the vax before it was his turn... he wanted it so badly.</p>

        <p>i think its more that they are doing the more vulnerable first which would mostly be more useless.</p>

        <p>No, it actually makes sense that the most 'at risk' from Covid get dibs. Even by the honest claim it only reduces symptoms, it makes sense. Even adding the rate of adverse reaction, it still makes sense. If I were in the high risk category (over 70, obese, co-morbidities) then even I would likely risk getting the jab. </p>
<p>I'm not though, so risk/benefit says I have a better chance just risking Covid than definitely getting the jab.</p>

        <p>I think it would be a good idea to choose those most vulnerable first… if this was a solid vaccine that they knew for a fact worked. But it’s an experiment so yes I think it’s wrong.</p>
