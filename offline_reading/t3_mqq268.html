    <strong>Covid srimulus checks and taxes. Anyone have to suddenly pay taxes at end of year because of the srimulus checks?</strong>
    <p><p>I want to see if anyone else here has done their taxes and noticed differences because of the stimulus checks. The $600 and $1200 rounds (first and second) only. </p>
<p>So my tax returns at the end of the year over the last 2 years has dropped from $1300 return at end of year to $400. Nothing on my end has changed other than the tax codes. That in itself is shitty. </p>
<p>But. Last night i was doing my taxes on turbo tax. And noticed this time around i have to pay $900 fed and $900 state. Prior year i got back from fed 900 (400 me and 500 for a dependent) and paid $200 to state. This time it 100% flipped on fed and state went from $200 to $900 (fuuuuuuccckkkkkk youuuuu commiefornia). So i was lile "what the shit fuck is this. My income only changed by about $500 yet my taxes more than doubled. Did a bit more digging.</p>
<p>Turn out if i zero out that $1800 total stimulus and lie that i didnt get it. My fed tax return go to $900 return to me. If i state i DID receive the stimulus then i OWE the difference of $900....and thats where im at.</p>
<p>So did anyone else do their taxes and noticed that the "hellp" from the government with the stimulus checks is literally just a cash advance on your tax returns and any $ over what you were to get back needs to be repaid to the IRS?</p>
<p>To me this looks like a loan. A loan i never agreed to and a loan with the IRS...? Anyone else experience this?</p></p>

        <p>I also received a letter from the treasury department that the stim payments are not taxable income as defined, so I have hardcopy info for my tax records if needed.</p>

        <p>Yes, Iâ€™m pretty sure I recall when they sent out the first stim checks they said it would be taxed when we did our returns.</p>

        <p>It's not. It's just that if you didn't get the CCP-virus payment, and you qualify, you claim it when you file your tax return. Thus, all the tax software will ask if you got it.</p>

        <p>It's not an advance. If you didn't get it, you get it as a credit that wasn't there the year before. A change that big means something else has changed, or there's an error on your 2019 or 2020 returns.</p>
