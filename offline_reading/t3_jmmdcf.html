    <strong>"Masks, false safety and real dangers, Part 2: Microbial challenges from masks" by Boris Borovoy, Colleen Huber, Maria Crisler</strong>

<p>Looking at current measures in juxtaposition with those taken during the Spanish Flu:</p>
<p>Some highlights:</p>
<p>"As we see from the above data, there was no significant correlation with mask use and either increase or reduction of deaths from COVID-19; thus masking could not have caused a significant reduction in deaths. In fact, two of the countries with the highest COVID-19 deaths also had high rates of mask use: Spain at 87% mask use and Brazil at 90% mask use. Again, masking could not have caused a significant reduction in deaths."</p>
<p>"Interestingly the above-cited paper that found a majority of 1918-1919 pandemic deaths to be from bacterial pneumonia was co-authored by Anthony Fauci, MD who has been tasked with advising the US on proper response to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, yet he has not publicly discussed this precedented risk of bacterial pneumonia in 2020, even having performed extensive research himself. It is also known that the 1918-1919 pandemic was the last time that human societies experimented with widespread long-term masking. As now, healthy people were made to wear masks, and it is thought by some that there would have been no pandemic in 1918 without masking. Are we repeating known mistakes from our history and what are the consequences?"</p>
<p>"One historian writes, “The quarantine, isolation and mask-wearing failed to diminish the spread of the influenza. Instead the practices likely increased fatality and had disastrous economic consequences. The medical policy of 1918 was contrary to the medical science of 1918, and the destructive practices of quarantine, isolation and mask-wearing were largely abandoned.”20 The harm extended to the next generation. Subsequent health outcomes included increased prevalence of heart disease in infants born in 1919." </p>

        <p>There is a study on bacterial build up in surgical masks and N95s. Surgeons optimally change masks every 90 mins. Also study finds that surgical masks don’t necessarily stop infection after surgery since the build up of bacteria can be dislodged when exhaling and get into the patient</p>

        <p>I just saw <a href="https://brandnewtube.com/v/GlC4Oz">this</a> video about masks. I do think its sad that we don’t have adequate PPE for healthcare workers, but I am so over the mask debates online. The pro-maskers chose that hill to die on, which is fine...but I am so sick of hearing the parroted messaging over and over and over. </p>
<p>In my area, I am starting to notice that although people pretty much mask up in stores and where businesses ask you to, but there have been social media posts of gatherings (outdoor church events, things like that) w/ no one wearing masks. </p>
<p>My thought? Hey, at least they seem to all be on the same side, hanging together free-faced not bothering others. They still wear masks at stores and stuff from my observation.</p>
<p>Doomers thought? Exponential spread, grandma killers, long term damage, and every breath a person takes w/o a mask = 6 more months of house arrest for everyone</p>
