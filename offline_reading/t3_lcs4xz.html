    <strong>Britain - One Nation Under Anaesthesia</strong>
    <p><p>A famous man once said that religion is the opiate of the masses. In the UK the true opiate of the people is the state, or more specifically, the public health and welfare system.</p>
<p>Almost all Brits rank '<em>our wonderful NHS</em>' as the thing that makes them most proud to be British, with personal freedom coming in at the thick end of 10th. In windows, adoring 'we love our NHS' posters are a very common sight, drawn by skype-schooled children, billboards are commonly seen along road sides, not funded by the state, but by the adoring adherents of the state religion. People participate in rituals that would seem bizarre to outsiders, with the weekly public-clapping ritual having been revived yesterday due to the death of the state's answer to Jesus. Talking of our new Christ, the man who died at the height of his national fame as a symbol for NHS fundraising, taken before his time at the <em>tender young age of 100,</em> has already been put forward by the media and the prime minister as the subject for a bronze statue, one before which we can all doubtlessly conduct our weekly ritual clapping, lest we suffer the wrath of our friends and neighbours.</p>
<p>But on to the topic of this post, the aforementioned anaesthesia. With the government having implemented a policy of UBI by the backdoor, via wage-furlough and Universal Credit, the average subject knows he will never truly have to go without. If you are not the owner of any property, you will be provided with means to obtain housing and sufficient monies to tend to your basic needs, utilities, groceries and all of the joys high-speed internet has to offer. Doubtless the rolling news and a host of internet-delivered services temper our spirits somewhat, but the literal opiate of the people really is the public-facing element of the state: our beloved NHS. Constant messaging in the media, by the government and even by senior royals would have most hook-line-and-sinker media-believers convinced that even the slightest dissatisfaction with life could constitute a 'mental health' issue. Apparently it's something that we all suffer from, whether or not we are aware of it - in our own way, according to the state, we're all just a little crazy. </p>
<p>So what is the Brit who is dissatisfied with his lot in life to do? Well given that all of your basic needs are provided for, it must be that you suffer from a mental health condition. Fear not, our heroic national health service is here to save you, save the clapping for later, at 8pm. Unlike in other developed countries, it is extremely easy to find yourself prescribed, for free, a rather hefty regime of psychotropic drugs. Zoloft, Prozac, Gabapentinoids and a host of other SSRIs, tranquilizers and sedatives are prescribed to Brits by our wonderful NHS at a rate much higher than other developed countries. Highest in the anglosphere and almost 2.5 times that of mainland Europe. So, given that the religion of the people is the NHS, religion is literally the opiate of the people, or at least the barbiturate of the people. Is this entirely accidental, or is a sedated population easier to control.</p>
<p>The USSR subsidized vodka, it was a great way of ensuring that the population was too inebriated to ferment revolution, indeed, it came from above under perestroika. Imperial China did with opium, Nazi Germany with Methamphetamine and by all accounts the population of North Korea is so sped-up that they work themselves to an exhausted frenzy, unable to imagine dissent after a chemically-induced 14-hour workday.</p>
<p>So this is not without precedent, could we slip into a techno-autocracy with a subservient service economy hanging on the back of a deregulated and highly-profitable financial services sector? It works well with Singapore. Any hangers-on are merely an inconvenience. Give them a stipend, some semi-democratic political pantomime, state-issued happy pills and cheap booze and they will no longer be a problem. Well-developed technocratic autocracies are becoming the system-de-jure for financial-service-reliant tax sinks the world over; Singapore and the UAE being the most recent examples. Our population love the state with worshipful reverence, as this pandemic has proven. The old Liberal Britain is dead, we're heading for a brave new future indeed. A new normal, if you will.</p></p>
