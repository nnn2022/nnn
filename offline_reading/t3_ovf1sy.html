        <p>I cannot logically understand how an employer can force a vaccine that is not even FDA approved. Especially now given evidence that it doesn’t do a damn thing to prevent the spread. </p>
<p>My husband got an email from his job saying he is not allowing in the office until he is fully vaccinated. I don’t know how long they will allow him to work from home. </p>
<p>How can companies just blindly make requirements? Are they going to be made responsible for any vaccine injuries that will occur?</p>

        <p>I think two things are going on here.   </p>
<p>A) Virtue signaling. This is just icing on the cake after all the work social justice BS coming from Disney lately, from their new 5th key of inclusion (ironic, since forcing non-vaxxed to quit isn't very inclusive) to changes on their rides like jungle cruise and splash mountain  </p>
<p>B) Reduce the workforce without having to pay layoff severances. Disney suffered great losses while their parks were closed and I imagine they're still struggling to please the shareholders. They had recently announced forcing people to come back to the office and relocations for many in CA--a benefit of which is people quitting if they don't want to--but had to walk that back because of Delta. So now conveniently they have a new way to force people to quit and reduce their employee expenses.</p>

<p>They seem to have forgotten how much they detested the leftist, virtue signaling of Newsom in CA all throughout 2020 when he forced Disneyland to remain shut and now are just joining his ranks.</p>
