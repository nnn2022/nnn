        <p>Uh-huh... so they're "discovering" this after 16 months of economic, social, and political assault on populations?  Add to this the suppression of effective treatments as well as murderous directives by Governors who used "science" and ubiquitous "abundance of caution" to shut down lives and livelihoods of the working classes and I'm left to wonder if and when so-called "leaders" will face Nuremburg-style justice.</p>

        <p>No, this was well known almost a year ago. It just has no purpose as it isn't going to stop any infections from occurring. There was no suppression of treatment options that worked with an appropriate efficacy/harm ratio. The lockdowns needed to happen much sooner and much stricter than the US performed, hence the 600k deaths we surpassed this week. With the half-assed shit and so many morons running around antivax Take your head out of your Trumpist propaganda's ass and learn how to think for yourself. Or if you don't want to, listen to the people who are actually dealing with treating these patients like myself instead of a news organization and a complete fucking idiot spouting known lies.</p>

        <p>LOL. Ok. As a medical worker it makes me fucking furious about the lies that were and still are coming out of Trump and the GOP's mouths about something they have no idea about. I can't stand the idiots who sucked it up and actively trying to fuck over people with their propaganda and BS. The whole of 2020 didn't need to happen except that the White House and GOP congress refused to listen to medical advice on how exactly to handle the thing. By the time a lockdown was put in place it was so late that there might as well not even have been one as spread had already happened to the point of being endemic in large populations in the US. A 6 week hard quarantine lockdown would have done wonders in Jan/Feb to halt the spread but was completely shit down by morons who were more interested in their political power than helping the American people.</p>

        <p>I am satisfied that you are who you are and are responding sincerely.  I cannot accept the premise that the GOP has cornered the market of deceit.  I can't debate on the level of a medical professional so you will have me at a disadvantage there.  Where I'm coming from is from a place where I see lies coming from all ends of the medical establishment.</p>
<p>The suppressed treatment, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16115318/">hydroxychloroquine</a> is what I see as a huge piece of medical suppression- particularly egregious because, for how poorly spoken and deceitful he might have been, Trump did attempt to promote this drug, which is primarily used for autoimmune diseases and malaria.  He was roundly pilloried for that as he was when he proposed a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/geoffwhitmore/2020/10/19/when-did-president-trump-ban-travel-from-china-and-can-you-travel-to-china-now/?sh=18ded85f7484">travel ban to and from China</a> at the end of January 2020.</p>
<p>It wasn't the GOP in control of states whose Governors ordered that nursing homes take in active cases- which arguably seeded the exploding death rates... and those orders came at a time when "the science" was used to justify that otherwise healthy people stay in their homes and entire segments of the economy faced being shut down.  Of course my own work, having been deemed an essential business was able to obtain professional floor decals within a week or so of the "social distancing" phrase becoming a buzz-phrase- yes it proves nothing.. but at a time when nonessential production and distribution were being shuttered, something was planned, configured, produced, and shipped a little too swiftly for me to be completely comfortable that it wasn't already produced and packaged; awaiting word to be shipped.</p>
<p>Of course the process of two weeks to flatten the curve got strung along; with spacing, restrictions, then masking galore (after having been told that masks didn't help)- except for the protests on last summer.  No concern about crown sizes there- but God forbid a church service be held.</p>
<p>I cannot bring myself to cast aside skepticism when the overwhelming sense I'm getting is that I'm being bullshitted... by everyone in control of the information and narrative.  I do not deny the fact that there's a virus and it is arguably more serious than a common cold or flu.  I had two coworkers hospitalized after getting it- and one is a healthy man in his early 30's.  I can certainly appreciate the effort of people like you who are actual front line workers.  I don't believe that the shit you're dealing with can be laid exclusively at the feet of Republicans.</p>
<p>I know we aren't going to agree but I felt you deserved some insight into why I'm a terminal skeptic and why I'm here.</p>
<p>Thank you for your service to our country.</p>

        <p>I never said the GOP cornered the market on deceit, I hate both parties as an equal opportunity hater. However, hydroxychloroquine is 100% ineffective in every peer reviewed research that has been performed on it, with no efficacy in reduction of severity of symptoms nor reduction of duration of illness. It does however cause significant liver damage and failure also leading to kidney failure when used over time. That's the reason he was destroyed for it, because he was making things up that syncophants would bring up with him while understanding none of it.</p>
<p>As for the vaccine there was already RNA vaccines under study and testing so it only required changing the seed coat proteins in order to make it. Nothing crazy or deceitful there. As for masks? You've got to seriously be fucking with me to believe that they didn't do anything. They are a huuuuge benefit for controlling spread and the viral load being out in the air if exposed. Just not even remotely a questionable thing. That's exactly the stuff that GOP should be removed from office for spreading lies that killed more people. It just isn't even debatable.</p>
<p>As for the virus itself, it is immensely more fatal and casualty causing than flu and the cold. Like not even remotely close. The long term damage is also pretty damn rough, my lungs are feel papery and stiff, just aren't what they used to be and I'm an army veteran, outdoorsman living at 10k ft in CO, and a Wildland firefighter. I'm in better shape than most to say the least but it's rough now, and my Covid was relatively mild compared to others. We had so many people dying gasping for breath that you couldn't do anything about and then a huge increase in strokes and heart attacks in young people due to Covid coagulopathy and damage to vascular system. Like unbelievably more, and I'm talking healthy 20, 30 and 40 yo's having massive strokes and MI's.</p>
<p>The nursing home stuff was straight up asinine, just a horrible decision, but it definitely wasn't just democrats, it was every state in the country. As hospitals overflowed there was no place to keep these people so that decision was made nationally. I don't know what a better possibility at the time would have been, but it definitely was hugely impactful on the nursing home population.</p>
<p>As for the amount of blame that can be blamed on the GOP, it is pretty damningly large. Absolute lies coming out of most of their mouths and encouraging the absolute worst things for a pandemic and individuals. The lack of actual quarantine did indeed increase the national deaths and injuries by about half. There was no need for 600k people to die.</p>
<p>I try not to be overly polarized against the GOP as I was a GOP voter all the way through McCain. Since then the party has become unhinged and is a dangerous threat for the country regarding wealthy disparity, national health coverage, education, and equality.</p>

        <p>Uhmm. Yeah, it does. So do alcohol, Lysol, toilet bowl cleaner and a ton of other daily use items around your home. The whole mouthwash thing is true as can be, but would only kill what's in there at that moment without lingering effects. So in effect it useless the moment you spit it out and take another breath.</p>
