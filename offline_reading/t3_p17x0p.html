    <strong>REPOST FOR VISIBILITY (I posted at 2 AM): META POST on A Shill's Operations</strong>
    <p><p>DO NOT accept this shill's "deal". She has CONSISTENTLY been trying to get pro-NN propaganda to the NNN front page. Report her and move on. DO NOT attempt to tag her in comments. Reddit has been permabanning any of my accounts that tag u/m**i**- or u/P************P**2***. I suspect foul play with the admins.</p>

<p>EDIT 1: Also reddit removed my post of science links against the narrative here it is: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TrueChad0530/comments/p0xgdy/spread_the_science/">https://www.reddit.com/user/TrueChad0530/comments/p0xgdy/spread_the_science/</a></p>
<p>EDIT 1.5: thanks to u/jayhasgin, here's an archive of the science post, in case reddit removes it again: https://web.archive.org/web/20210809141733if_/https://www.reddit.com/user/TrueChad0530/comments/p0xgdy/spread_the_science/</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Please make a post with a screenshot and link to it in the comments if you've been contacted. More proof is always welcome.</p>
<p>EDIT 3: <strong>we need visibility, please help us get this to the front page. Expose the propaganda machinery</strong></p>
<p>EDIT 4: interesting how someone starts spamming to try to remove this post from view...</p>
<p>EDIT 5: Oh boy, now she's trying to frame me?? https://www.old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/p07c5z/well_this_is_interesting/h87bm7q</p>
<p>Well you guys go look at her comment history which she claims is "proof" that she wouldn't do this kind of thing. And she refuses provide evidence, apparently. And there are somehow 5 awards on that comment already... interesting.</p>
<p>EDIT 6: quote from u/cannuckgamer:</p>
<p>&rt; I need to preface something prior to getting to the point:</p>
<p>&rt; I'd say about 4 or 5 months ago I noticed she kept on trying to sway the narrative towards how there's no proof that these vaccines were bad, and vaccination was the only way out (LOL). Anyways, I told her that NNN was all about free choice, and we should never be coerced into taking it, and she's free to do anything she wants, but she needed to realize that her attempts were seen as being a shill, etc.</p>
<p>&rt; Afterwards, I guess because I maintained a civil discourse with her (him?) that she messaged me in private decrying out she was banned from NNN. I told her she should message the Mods if she was so distraught, but I questioned why she wanted to be on this sub because I pointed out to her that her post history was totally the opposite of what NNN is all about. She said she found a "connection" here at NNN, and was actually on the fence about if covid-vaccines were good or not, so she wanted to remain here (*Note: her current post history says otherwise, in fact now she's insulting &amp; making derogatory remarks about anti-covid-vaxxers).</p>
<p>&rt; Nothing weird went on with the brief private direct messages, just me telling her that she obviously ruffled waaaaaaaay too many feathers here on NNN, and that she should cool it if she wanted to get her ban removed. I guess it got removed because I later saw her post (somewhat) more nonsense. I've had no contact with her (him?) ever since, and today's the first day that I've seen her name mentioned here at NNN. LOL, oh boy... she's in the top 1% of attractiveness? She sounds like one of those FBI honeypots, or worse, she sounds like one of those dudes who act like one of those beta-males or soy-cucks. LOL</p>
