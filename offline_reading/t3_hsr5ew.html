    <strong>My wife has finally turned against "the new nornal"</strong>
    <p><p>My wife has been worried sick about the virus since it became a big deal a few months ago. She's a waitress and now that the restaurant she works at is opening up again, they've released a bunch of stupid and draconian rules to "increase safety and proper hygiene." These include wearing a mask at ALL times, not talking to fellow employees, wearing gloves, and her least favorite, washing her hands and face every hour. This means she can't put makeup on at all or have any cosmetics on at work. Now, my wife is the kind of girl who needs to have her eyebrows done to go grocery shopping. Being asked to go to work without makeup is like asking her to go without pants. She's pissed and fed up with the whole thing. Guess you don't separate a girl from her makeup!</p></p>

        <p>I’ve heard of employees having to wash their hands every hour (it’s built into my state’s mask order for guidelines for “essential” businesses), but not wash their faces. </p>
<p>Your wife should be allowed to wear makeup to work if she wants to.</p>
<p>Not to drag politics into this, but it’s ironic to me that “pro choice” people are obsessed with telling the whole country what to put on their faces and what to do with their bodies when they always fight to keep their “choice.”</p>

        <p>Well, it's turning out that nearly the entire pro choice movement is a bunch of lying hypocrites who don't actually give a shit about bodily autonomy. </p>
<p>Which is depressing as fuck to me because I actually have always cared a great deal about bodily autonomy. And I really didn't know that was just a buzzword they used to get what they wanted. I'm blown away by the hypocrisy on a daily basis. As soon as it was even slightly convenient for them to throw the "my body my choice" concept out the window, that's exactly what they did.</p>

        <p>To be fair, there's glaring hypocrisy from both sides. My best friend is pro-life, but she despises the pro-life movement. Hell, she knows I know go to Planned Parenthood (which the pro-life movement hates!) for testing. Not a day in our friendship has ever given a damn because she doesn't want to know my medical business. Likewise, I don't ask her that kind of stuff or care where she goes for it. And that's why we're still friends.</p>
<p>Anything that's a movement will have its extremists. I believe most people really mean well. The extremists just become the voice.</p>

        <p>Because you'll see how they dodge that with impeccable logic:</p>
<p>"You don't wear a mask to protect yourself, you wear a mask to protect spreading it to others. We're trying to protect other people from getting it."</p>

        <p>I will never not be pro-choice. However, the lockdown stupidity has pushed me further and further into the conservative side, and I think that is permanent for me. The meaning of being liberal has changed waaaay to much in the last 10-15 years for me to identify with it anymore.</p>

        <p>I could have written this myself. My beliefs about where I fall on the political spectrum have been challenged A LOT in the last few months. </p>
<p>I’ve always been “left-libertarian” on the political compass. I’ve started to realize that my “libertarian” side (as in the y-axis on the graph, not the political party, because although my values align more with the Libertarian Party than either of the ruling ones, I don’t agree with them on everything... for example I’m still in favor of reasonable government social programs to help those in need and don’t mind paying higher taxes for it) has always been more important to me than the “left” side, and the further into outer space the “left” gets, the more I’m starting to feel like I’m on the middle of the x-axis.</p>

        <p>Sadly sign language are difficult with masks because of it relies a lot on facial expression and lip movements. It's like for an English speaker to distinguish the words "can" and "car". Very similar looking words with different meanings.</p>
