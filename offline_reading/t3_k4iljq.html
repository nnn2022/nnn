    <strong>My FIL reminds me of people who are so pro-lockdown.</strong>
    <p><p>My father-in-law (FIL) was a lifelong smoker. My fiancé always tried to get him to quit. He always told his dad he’d end up having a stroke. My FIL never listened. He ended up moving several hours away and up in the mountains. He never went to the doctor except for when my fiancé or one of his siblings made him go. His blood pressure was dangerously high. The doctor gave him a blood pressure medication to take. My FIL refused to take it. It was a pill every day, it was not hard at all. He went down to my SIL’s house in January of last year and had a stroke there. I remember a week before it happened my fiancé was on the phone with him and was demanding he take his medication or he’s going to have a stroke. My MIL has severe dementia and no nursing home will take her because she’s aggressive. My FIL put all of his kids in the position to take care of them and deal with the consequences of his actions and he didn’t care. His children and their partners are having to put their lives on hold to take care of them.</p>
<p>This is why lockdowns enrage me. It’s so similar to what happened with my FIL but on a much larger scale. One of the major comorbidities of COVID is obesity. For most people that is something they can fix. It may be hard and I understand but it’s doable. I don’t like to pick on fat people but I can’t help but be upset now. So many of these “healthy young people” who are hospitalized with COVID are morbidly obese. Because those people didn’t take responsibility for themselves, the rest of us have to deal with it. I know a lot of other conditions that make COVID worse can’t be changed, like old age. I get it but obesity is a big one that can be changed. </p>
<p>Are you seeing the parallels between my situation and these lockdowns? These people who want us to lockdown remind me of my FIL. They indulge in unhealthy behaviors like my FIL, then something bad happens to them and act like we’re the selfish ones for wanting to live our lives. My FIL is still alive and he’s a major dick to all his kids and acts like this is all their fault. We’re not responsible for their actions and we shouldn’t have to deal with the consequences. This absolutely infuriates me.</p></p>
