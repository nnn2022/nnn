    <strong>Wanted to share something I learnt today - The Tuskegee experiment</strong>
    <p><p>Look it up!!</p>
<p>But to some up what happened, after the Great Depression the government wanted to run an experiment on black men who had Syphilis. They wanted to see what happened to them if the disease was left untreated for their entire lives and the effects it would have on their body. The government purposely targeted Macon County, Alabama. Which after the Great Depression was an extremely poor, run down county, home to many African American people. So what the government did was come in and say they wanted to perform free tests on a group of African American individuals. </p>
<p>The first test they ran was a blood test and the doctors picked all the men who took part in the study had what they called “bad blood” (everyone who had Syphilis) and this is what they told the men. In reality the doctors knew they had Syphilis. But since the men were poorly educated and trusted the doctors, they truly believed they had bad blood. The doctors then said that since the men had bad blood, they were eligible to be part of the program  in exchange for hot meals, free car rides and compensations for their families if anything happened to them. Since the African American community was very poor and desperate for any extra help, they jumped on the opportunity and agreed to be part of the experiment. At first the tests they were doing was routine and normal, but as time went on the tests became more painful and weirder. Eventually some of the men started getting very sick, developed tumours, bad headaches, etc. </p>
<p>Some men would die, but the others that survived would go on to find out in 1973 when the press was released about this story that they part of a government backed study to find out what happened to African American men who had Syphilis that was left untreated their entire lives. Also penicillin was found to be a cure in the 1940’s, so not only did the doctors not care to treat the men, they let them suffer knowing that there was a cure for these men.   </p>
<p>So if anyone ever tells you the government would never do something like that, they most certainly will and have in the past. </p>
<p>Cheers</p></p>

        <p>Fair enough. It didn’t use to be common knowledge in the US either just more recently like the past 10 or so years there’s been a lot of publicity about it.</p>

        <p>It really isn't taught in the US either more's the shame. It wasn't the last or the worst.</p>
<p>I probably shouldn't mention it, but have you googled project MK-Ultra?</p>
<p>I was just posting about this today, to someone who trusted the US government.</p>
