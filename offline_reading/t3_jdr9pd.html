    <strong>People who wear masks</strong>
    <p><p>“People who wear masks are idiots who can’t think for themselves.” This is commented in some way or another in most threads. This is just silly, is this a sub for skepticism or is this just a dumb cult like flat Earth? Because that’s exactly their logic too, the flat Earthers. Because it’s like, “well if you did any research you stupid pathetic mongrel you would know as I do, that this is all a government hoax.” ???
And I know some people are actually looking for facts, finding clues, actual studies, and whatnot. And I love that, that’s why I like this sub. But it’s kinda obvious some people just don’t like masks and get unreasonably upset over it so they hop on this crazy train of conspiracies just to say masks are bad at the end of the day. 
That’s my rant, some of this sub just seems like upset karens , not people with “skepticism “ about the new normal.</p></p>
