        <p>It says nothing about airborne transmission which is what covid is.  Also, it pretends that wearing a mask doesn't cause bacterial build-up which it's been proven to do a hundred times in the last century.  </p>
<p>In the 1918 flu outbreak that killed 650,000 Americans, it was found that most of those people survived the flu, but were so weakened by it that they died of a bacterial lung infection.  And since there was a mask mandate, what do you think could have caused that?  A compromised immune system coupled with a filthy mask that was used again and again and again.</p>
