    <strong>Chris Sky delivers an inspiring speech at massive freedom rally in Calgary with thousands of people!</strong>

<p>I was there, it was an enthusiastic, peaceful, freedom-loving crowd. After the speeches they marched through the streets, with the support of the police who said their only concern was ensuring the protest could proceed safely. Cars passed by honking in support giving thumbs up constantly.</p>
<p>After the rally I found a restaurant staying open for indoor dining in defiance of the lockdowns, and it was glorious. I felt like I went back in time. Not a mask in sight on anyone, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms posted on the front door, place packed with happy people, live music, children playing and dancing.</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of speaking with the owner who mentioned they haven't had anyone get sick there but has tragically seen 20 of his friends commit suicide throughout this shit show. The next day I was able to find another restaurant staying open in defiance, and it was just awesome as well, they had a big flag saying "freedom is essential". You're god damn right it is.</p></p>

        <p>The main point I took from this is what he said about getting organized. We should do this here amongst ourselves as well. I belong in the parents who don't want their kids wearing masks camp, as well as the employee of large corporation who may require vaccines camp.</p>

<p>Who wants to get organized with me?</p>

        <p>Chris Sky is an amazing person and the definition of a patriot. He's opening a lot of people's eyes and inspiring a lot of amazing Canadians to get educated as to what's really going on and fight back. As an American, I genuinely pray that you guys are successful in getting your freedoms back.</p>
