    <strong>Where are we heading? What's the endgame?</strong>
    <p><p>Most people with some common sense left can see the insanity that's unfolding, particularly concerning vax-passports, the crazy rage against un-vax people, the censorship etc.</p>
<p>I wonder what's the edgame? Will they admit the dangers of the vax and the amount of people it's killed/injured and discontinue the damn thing eventually? Or will the cover up continue forever and the un-vax be completely shut from society, forcing many to give in, but then what..?</p>
<p>Would love to hear your views on what you think is going to happen in the longer term.Myself I feel like I'm thinking- this can't last forever, the common sense has to prevail, just need to hold on for now, but I don't know whether I'm being over-optimistic.</p></p>

        <p>I can’t answer your question but I just want to weigh in and say I’ve been feeling the same. But how much longer can we hold on for? I’m struggling to see how the governments of the world will backtrack on it now. Although it’s encouraging to see some US states giving the new normal the finger.</p>

        <p>I see it very much as a "developing situation" kinda thing, things change constantly. Say this report from Israel about 85+ % severe hospitalized patient being vaccinated, how long will that stay under wraps. https://twitter.com/vonbrauckmann/status/1423348759682031626</p>

        <p>As cliche as it sounds it’s total control. Passports are just the beginning, next we have digital currency followed by some form of a social credit score.</p>
<p>Today noncompliance means you might get silenced on social media or perhaps excluded from venues or events. In the future you might have your digital currency wiped, or controlled to the point where you can only buy what the government says you can and outside of bartering there won’t be much you can do about it.</p>
<p>Fast forward another 10 years and you’ll be giving regular biological samples to prove you haven’t violated the approved diet. You’ll be required to provide samples to continue receiving any sort of healthcare, or otherwise pay exorbitant fees.</p>
<p>The concept of individual choice and freedom will be long gone. Of course the socioeconomic status quo will remain the same, you’ll have lost everything and all for nothing.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the perspective. Before I'd have said- no way the majority of people are going to  accept this, but from the misplaced rage towards un-vaxx, all this "othering" ,"us vs <em>them</em>" that's going on..has really opened my eyes how easily people can be manipulated. </p>
<p>Slight glimmer of hope- am definitely seeing some being disgruntled along the lines "this was not what was promised", with the return of masks etc. Unfortunately a lot of it seems misdirected towards un-vax, who are being scapegoats for all the worlds problems nowadays.</p>
