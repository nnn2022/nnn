    <strong>Not to get ahead of myself, but the last 2 days have felt like THE normal.</strong>
    <p><p>So, here in Ohio, the fuhrer is finally lifting mandates tomorrow.  Yesterday, I took my son to a monster truck show in Columbus.  I would estimate that at least 95% of the people were not wearing masks.  Even the police and first responders on stand by were unmasked.  Mind you, it was a surprisingly very diverse crowd.  It felt really good to be around so many people living normally.  Then today, I had to stop at Walgreens for a scrip after I picked up my son from the sitter.  To preface, I normally will wear a mask, at least half-heartedly, in stores with a mask policy.  They have a choice to refuse service, just like I have a choice to not shop there.  Never have I worn one because the government told me I have to.  When I pulled into the parking lot and parked, I realized I didn't have a bandana or mask in my car.  I figured, the worst they could do was ask me to put on a mask, and I would just take my business elsewhere.  Surprisingly, not one person said a word to me.  From what I could tell, I was the only unmasked person in the store, besides my 3 year old son.  Even at the pharmacy counter, the tech was very nice and helpful.  I expected to get some kind of attitude about not wearing a mask.  It was just a couple of really good days.  Even though mandates are lifting tomorrow, I am prepared for it to all fall apart again.  I just want to ride this wave as long as I can.</p></p>

        <p>DeSwine's not lifting them (not like he had the right to put them in place in the first place) they just finally took his power away. At least that's what I heard. I hope it's true, since our rights weren't his to take in the first place, so they're not his to just give back once he's had his fun. If we get our rights back, it has to be through us, the people. If not, that just sets a precedent that it's okay for our leaders to just take our rights and give them back as they please.</p>

        <p>We can only hope something comes of the controversy over the origins of the virus. Protests are beginning to pop up around the world, doctors and lawyers who have been censored are beginning to organize themselves more and more â€“ it does look like there is a shift happening.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, we need to hope for the best and prepare for the worst. Hopefully we can break the streak of the system always winning.</p>

        <p>I am possibly the only adult, when it comes to my wife's family, that has refused the v<em>x.  I am surrounded by people the get all of their "news", "science", and "facts" from the tv or newspaper.  I really hope something actually happens with Fraudci, and that whole deal.  I will be so vindicated( assuming these people will wake up).  My wife got the JJ shot about 3 months ago, against my wishes.  May 2nd, our baby girl was born.  Normal labor and delivery, and nothing was ever seen on scans.  She was placed in the NICU for breathing support, due to meconium asperation in the womb.  While in the NICU, her first night, she started having apneic episodes.  After head ultrasound and MRI, blood on the brain from a veinous stroke was determined to be the cause of apneic seizures.  She's doing very well, and hasn't had another seizure after her first couple of days.  As of now, they haven't been able to find a cause.    I have started researching if there are other cases that are similar.  The scariest thing, is so many doctors and specialists are blindly pushing the v</em>x, with no long term studies.</p>

        <p>That is some scary stuff, I'm glad she's doing well. I do think it is insane that we are encouraging pregnant women of all people to take this vaccine. Unfortunately the doctors who are banding together and going after the WHO the CDC and the other usual suspects are dwarfed by the number of doctors that are pushing the vaccination effort. But I suspect more and more people are going to be coming out of the woodwork voicing their concerns as their individual lines in the sand are crossed. A lot of people who are against the vaccine have just been laying low and keeping their mouth shut. </p>
<p>In order for people to wake up they need to see the people who they've been worshiping this entire time be exposed for their complicity in the pandemic. Until then, nothing we little people say will matter much, because they so vehemently believe that we are the enemy and not the government and the pharma companies that want complete control over our health choices.</p>

        <p>Yeah. I hear ya.  I'm definitely the family lunatic in the eyes of a few of my wife's family members.  My MIL and SIL are so blinded by MSM and the teachers' union.  They may be a couple of the small percentage that will stay asleep forever.  Due to my support of Trump and my rejection of coronaculture and v*x, I've been called racist, I hit my wife(because she defends me to them, so I'm obviously strong arming her), I'm splitting up the family, and I care about myself more than I care about my kids.  The TDS and Covidiocy are ridiculous.</p>

        <p>Yup, all for wanting to have a say in your own medical decisions. Absolute horse shit. I was planning on going to grad school after I finish up with my degree, and I just don't know how far I can get in my field while remaining unvaccinated. So I'm being told I have to go against my principles if I want to pursue my career, and I deserve to be forced to squander everything I've worked for because I'm just being a big baby and am afraid of getting a shot.</p>
<p>The constant gaslighting is exhausting. I really can't imagine things don't start getting ugly in the near future, hell it's already getting ugly. Time will tell, I guess.</p>
