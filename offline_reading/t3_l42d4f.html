    <strong>My grievances with how the State and Federal governments have handled the pandemic and how we need to stop complaining about masks and focus on more important matters.</strong>
    <p><p><strong><em>General</em></strong> <strong><em>Grievances:</em></strong></p>
<p>I have many grievances with how this pandemic is being handled and the mask issue ranks low on the list. My main grievance is how the governors (I live in PA) are shutting down business, mandating masks on private property, and ultimately destroying livelihoods through "edicts". AFAIK, no states or very few states has had a shutdown bill go through proper committees, have it be voted on by both the state representatives then the state senate, then signed signed by the governor or the veto be overridden. Through a stroke of a pen, governors and unelected bureaucrats (State secretary of health) were able to control peoples lives. Another grievance is the moving goalposts. If the state governments told us almost a year ago that businesses would be forcibly shut down through edicts for almost or more than 8 months, both people from the left, right, and centrists would have risen up and overthrown the government. Literally. Instead, the government (both state and federal) said "15 days to slow the the curve" then the lockdowns were briefly lifted in some states and then before thanksgiving a lot of states went back into lockdown. The government would take away our rights then give us back some of our rights and then take away our rights again. It's almost like a combination of "moving goalposts" and "bait and switch".</p>
<p><strong><em>Protests:</em></strong></p>
<p>When the "re-open the economy protests" happened it was a few months before all the BLM protests/riots. Protestors were called "grandma killers" and the protests were referred to as "super spreader events". Pictures and videos of nurses confronting the "re-open protestors" went viral and were widely applauded. Fast forward a few months and the BLM protests/riots were in full swing. Healthcare workers even went outside and applauded the protestors. The same media that called people who wanted their livelihoods back as "super spreaders" not only applauded the BLM protests which were arguably thousands and thousands of times bigger, they defended the looting and arson which destroyed small businesses even further. Few MSM outlets condemned the rioting.</p>
<p><strong><em>The near future:</em></strong></p>
<p>Masks help "slow the spread" but they are not the silver bullet to kill COVID. I honestly don't know what is. What's the point of getting the vaccine if you still have to wear a mask? I think the next hysteria will be Biden extending his 100 day mask mandate as other people have mentioned (moving goalposts) and possibly a fourth of the country refusing to be vaccinated. Least likely the government will mandate the vaccine. Most likely and basically guaranteed there will be digital passports where people will have to show a QR code on their phone in order to go to college, concerts, fly on an airplane, mass transit, enter stores, enter banks, etc.</p>
<p><strong><em>The struggle over Power and the Pursuit of Happiness:</em></strong></p>
<p>The government has never had this much power. Do you really thing they will voluntarily give it up? When I heard my mom saying during the second state lockdown: "I wonder when the governor will let us open everything back up?" I responded "Everything can open back up if the people collectedly decide to all open back up. They cant permanently shut everyone down for violating the edicts." Not only could the government not afford to lose all the tax revenue, imagine the blood that would be spilled by the thousands of people that would have absolutely nothing to loose but their freedom. I'm not advocating violence I'm just giving my opinion on how I think people would react in this certain situation.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Biden Administration:</em></strong></p>
<p>I don't think that it's a coincidence that one hour after Biden was inaugurated the WHO changed it's testing guidelines: <strong>"The guidance warned against diagnosing someone as having the virus just because he tests positive if he does not present with symptoms of COVID-19. It also warned about the high risk of false positives: “The cycle threshold (Ct) needed to detect virus is inversely proportional to the patient’s viral load. Where test results do not correspond with the clinical presentation, a new specimen should be taken and retested using the same or different NAT technology."</strong></p>
<p><strong>“As disease prevalence decreases, the risk of false positive increases. The probability that a person who has a positive result (SARS-CoV-2 detected) is truly infected with SARS-CoV-2 decreases as prevalence decreases, irrespective of the claimed specificity,” the WHO continued.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An even more surprising admission followed: the document described PCR tests merely as an “aid for diagnosis” and did not place any greater weight upon the results of PCR tests. “Most PCR assays are indicated as an aid for diagnosis, therefore, health care providers must consider any result in combination with timing of sampling, specimen type, assay specifics, clinical observations, patient history, confirmed status of any contacts, and epidemiological information.”</strong></p>
<p>So I think it's likely that the standards for declaring someone a COVID death or COVID positive will be substantially raised, making the death rate plummet and thus making Joe Biden/Democrats the lord and savior of the USA. As a conservative I hope that this happens. Why? Because of my previously mentioned statement "The government has never had this much power" I just want this bullshit to be over. I don't care who gets credit for it. I fear that the "new strains or variants" will prolong this epidemic. We used to hear about "Long COVID" (The long term effects of COVID felt by previously healthy people) but the general populous didn't really worry about it enough so the "new strains" are officially the new boogieman. I'm not denying that they exist I just recognize their potential to prolong the epidemic and the unchecked new powers the government has. Also, the Biden administration has skewed statistics to make them look favorable. They said that under the Trump administration, they only averaged 500,000 of vaccinations per day while the Biden administration averages 1,000,000 per day. Seems like the Democrats doubled the vaccination rate right? No. It only appears that way because Trump had to start the distribution and rollout of the vaccine from scratch and it increased it to a point where nearly 1,000,000 Americans were being vaccinated a few days before the inauguration. So comparing the averages of both administrations vaccination rate is unfair.</p>
<p>Conveniently Democrat mayors and governors have decided to open back up right after Biden took office.</p>
<p>Fuck your "new normal" and fuck your "great reset". Enough said about that. Watch the videos posted below if you're interested.</p>
<p>In conclusion I wish people worried about everything I said except for masks. Instead of ensuring that governors cant shut down businesses through edicts we're squabbling about masks.</p>
<p>Here are some videos I highly recommend.</p>
