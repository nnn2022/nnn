    <p><p>Re: Participating in your own destiny </p>
<p>Skip to the bottom and read the email. This is not a partisan issue. This pertains to our freedoms as citizens of the world. This is a call to action against the C19 Vaccine Passport mandate. Again, it we are talking about private, peaceful and powerful action. If you are on board:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In an attempt to streamline the process, I've included the steps to find your Member of National Assembly's email address;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also attached is a template email that you can COPY/PASTE along with your personal info. Feel free to personalize and build upon the content as you see fit;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please share this as much as possible (Facebook, Telegram, What's App, Signal, private groups, etc...), wherever people can feed off your initiative. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This will go through your provincial representative who will take the message up to the federal level. A follow-up email may be required of you from your MNA. Please take the steps, this is your future and your children's future we're talking about. </p>

<p>Content: </p>
<p>Dear [Mr./Mrs. X], </p>
<p>Please accept this email as a renewal of my faith and support for you as an elected representative of the people. I am writing today asking you to take a stance against the implementation of the C19 vaccine passport. It is a mandate that I –and the informed citizens of my riding– perceive as being rushed, to say the least. In fact, it is my understanding that the mandate will encroach upon our basic human rights according to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. As it stands, the following sections (and related provisions) of our celebrated Charter would have it that:</p>
<p>• Section 6 of the Charter of Rights and Freedom says Canadians have the right to enter, remain in and leave Canada;</p>
<p>• Section 2a of the Charter of Rights and Freedom says Canadians have freedom of conscience and religion;</p>
<p>• Section 15 of the Charter of Rights and Freedom says Canadians are not allowed to be discriminated against based on, for example, mental or physical ability (health).</p>
<p>We have been made to believe that our people cannot make the appropriate decisions to ensure their personal wellbeing. I stand for the protection of my fellow citizens’ right to be vaccinated, and to take any and all precautions toward the safeguard of their health. I do not believe we are stupid and powerless creatures; we are dignified and upright, and we have the information at our disposal to make our own choices. The individuals who decide against the vaccine should have their privacy respected, and kept from further restrictions. It is a terrible shame to see our great country sink into a 2-caste system. The division is unfolding before our eyes. </p>
<p>Please continue to champion our rights and freedoms. Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>[You can also confirm your address and request that your MNA transfer the request to the Federal Government directly]</p></p>
