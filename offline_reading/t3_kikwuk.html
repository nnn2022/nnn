    <strong>For the first time, today I shopped and picked up a prescription in Walgreens maskless.</strong>
    <p><p>I know it sounds like a self-righteous, dickhead virtue signal (and that may in part be true) but I still have to share that with my fellow granny-assassins. I was scared, glanced at my crappy old glove compartment muzzle, and said fuck it. No one said a thing, and the cashier was very polite (as I tried to be as well). </p>
<p>If you're ever contemplating it, just go for it, but do it with a gentle-yet-firm disposition - you'd be surprised at what attitude can do to any given scenario.</p></p>

        <p>Depends. If you're young and 5'9 like me people will give you endless shit, and they take pride in it. If you come off as a weak target (like myself) you'll almost instantly run into the jerkoff loser that has been waiting for weeks to finally lash out on someone.</p>

        <p>I'm relatively young and only two inches taller, and kind of a schlub. </p>
<p>Of course there are going to be bully pricks we run into, that's life, and I'm sure if I continue pushing myself to fight the social pressure I will be accosted, or at the very least spoken nasty to; The real test of strength and courage is how we would react to such things, which is a good thing to be prepared for but shouldn't be expected - that's the fear. I honestly think I would simply stand up straight, face the person, smile, and continue with what I was occupied with. Gentle, yet firm.</p>

        <p>And the real kicker is that most times, a silent smile and prompt dismissal hits harder and louder than a spinning back kick. People are more afraid of public ridicule than physical altercation deep down.</p>

        <p>I’ve started going muzzle-less places a couple of weeks ago (before I would pull my gaiter pulled down to my chin). 
I’ve only been asked twice (two different places). First place I had the gaiter around my neck so I pulled it. The second place just asked if I wanted a mask (I had left my gaiter in my purse), I said no and they left me alone.</p>

        <p>Good shit!</p>
<p>The scenario I'm most worried about, more so than an angry troll yelling at me, is a polite worker following orders. I've got a few ideas how to deal with that, be gentle and kind, yet still stand my ground (it mostly involves making them run around to get me one and then them accidentally ripping😌).</p>

        <p>I'm in Texas--pretty centric politically where I live. Granted, I don't go many places, but I literally never, ever, ever wear the muzzle. Not for nuthin. The only time someone has said anything to me was at HEB. A fellow shopper walked past me and said, "wear a mask, idiot." I just looked and smiled as he glared back at me. I really do think that my presence has something to do with it. I'm a big dude, and sometimes get asked if I was in the military (never was). I think I probably come across as intimidating, but I promise I'm just a softy inside with insecurities just like the rest of us.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I was in Austin, and had to go into HEB to grab some last minute Thanksgiving food. Went in without the muzzle, and I swear the looks I got from people made me think I was an alien. So much for Keeping Austin Weird. These days it's Keep Austin Blue and Keep Austin Selling Out.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, wife wears the muzzle. Sometimes if we're out in public together, and she asks me to put mine on, because it's making her uncomfortable, I'll put it on. But rest assured, I ONLY BACK DOWN TO HER. The rest of the muzzle guzzlers can get lost.</p>
<p>Oh, the last thing I'll say is that anytime I see a fellow muzzle ditcher in public, I always make sure to make eye contact with them and give them the nod of approval. I have unspoken bonds with these people, whether they realize it, or not.</p>

        <p>Oh trust me, they realize, and thats important.</p>
<p>The minute you said Austin I already knew what was coming lol; Gotta love these tards moving out of tyrannical cities and states to escape the very same mindset and practices they inevitably perpetrate once resettled somewhere untainted, fertile, and cozy. But hey, woketards gon' woketard.</p>
<p>Good on you for standing up to this, and for what seems like most of this nightmare - I've always opposed but am only now actually not giving a fuck about what anyone in the community thinks of me, or how it can negatively affect my (already dwindling anyway) business. I know I'll find a way even if everything's taken from me, but lots of money and a (false) feeling of perceived "safety" in going along with any of this is like a fate worse than death. Granted, I don't have a family of my own so I don't have as much to lose as others stand to, but what the go-along-to-get-along actors don't understand is that they will lose everything anyway if something doesn't change. These people, some of them good people, really believe "just one more year", "just one more shot", "just one more liberty taken, don't worry, I'll get it back soon", etc. and that's sad and akin to sheep being led to slaughter. </p>
<p>But people are waking up, so that's a good thing. What I worry about is how and what "they" are planning 5, 10, 50 steps in advance, and if it is truly possible to uproot it. Fuck it though, live free or die I say.</p>

        <p>Yeah seriously guys just do it whenever possible. Maybe sometimes a prick will be a prick but alot of them will fuck off if you tell them you have a medical exemption, the more you don't wear them the more people who are scared to break the rules will also stop wearing them.</p>

        <p>I go everywhere without one after researching the municipal bylaw. there is an exemption for medical conditions. if there's mask enforcement at the door, I have found it better to courteously inform them of my medical exemption rather than arrogantly walking inside.</p>
