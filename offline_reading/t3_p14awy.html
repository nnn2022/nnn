    <strong>The hospital where I work</strong>
    <p><p>I was on my way out for the day and saw an elderly couple coming in the main entrance.  They were instantly "greeted" though it always seems like a greeting you'd get by walking into a high security facility when you don't belong in there.</p>
<p>She said she was there for her appointment with whatever department it was and they began to guide the two of them to the desk for their temperature.  Unfortunately, before that could happen, the husband said she had tested positive for Covid.  The woman immediately told the husband that since she has covid, he could not come in with her and had to leave.  He had no choice but to turn around and leave the hospital.</p>
<p>I was disgusted.  Let someone tell me that!   They live together!  They are married and he had to hand her over so she could be treated like a plague rat and isolated?</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this elderly woman was NOT sick.  She was not coughing or struggling to breathe or doing ANYTHING that they tell you in the horror stories that covid patients do.  She walked in just fine under her own power (though slowly due to her age).  </p>
<p>The hospitals know that the PCR test is broken.  They know.  It's their job to know.  They put these policies in place because they don't care.</p>
<p>I say resist.  Last year I took in my disabled roommate to her appointment and was told to leave when we got in.  I was to leave her and let her find her own way to the doctor's office located on the second floor.  I told the lady no and pointed out that I am not going to leave her.  She is disabled and has a lot of trouble walking by herself.  I talked over the lady when she tried to counter and challenged her.  She agreed to let me escort her.  </p>
<p>Always resist.  Stop letting these places separate us!</p></p>

        <p>They will probably make her even sicker now so they can get their bonus government money for the fake positive.   Heads should be rolling.</p>

        <p>It's the same mentality that keeps a husband out of his wife's delivery room! Whatever happened to logic and sanity?</p>

<p>This confused me because I thought you meant the old woman told her husband (you had referred to the greeter as they so I didn't realize she was female) .... You might edit it to say the greeter told the husband...</p>
