    <strong>Bro fuck disney</strong>
    <p><p>Kudos to Disney World for opening, but this delaying movies, and releasing things on Disney+ is just stupid, and could permanently harm the movie industry. WTF</p></p>

        <p>Part of the problem is that social distancing measures make the process a hassle. I have seen multiple movies in the theater over the last few months. When I have gone by myself, it's not a big deal. But when you try to get seats for the family, the way they are forced to spread the seats out makes it really hard to get seats together. It's super confusing buying tickets online, and the way things are spaced doesn't make much sense. And that makes the experience for a lot of people not worth it. Especially since there really aren't many great options with new releases. I really enjoyed Tenet (seen it twice), but it's definitely not for everyone. It's confusing as hell. The other new movies have been slammed by the critics. And going and seeing classics like Star Wars and Indiana Jones is only appealing to a certain type of person.</p>

        <p>It really shouldnt be that big of a deal. There's something like 4 major movies in theaters. They could realistically dedicate half of the 16 or so theaters in most multiplexes to Tenet or Whatever the big movie of the week is instead of giving them only 3-4 like normal. </p>
<p>It will definitely be harder to release indie movies or small budget stuff but for the big stuff, just give half your screens to the major movie each week.</p>

        <p>Bruh I wouldn’t be surprised if that’s the point.  On top of charging you the subscription they can now charge £20 or $30 for a single movie with no competition since theatres are closed instead of tickets ranging from (here at least) £5-12. You don’t even own the movie.  It’s expensive rental </p>
<p>Where else are you gonna see Mulan, or Black Widow? The marvel fanboys and girls will shill out for that alone.  </p>
<p>A lot of companies would probably be more than happy for lockdowns to continue as it means no competition.</p>
<p>Piracy will undoubtedly increase.  I’m never paying for Disney plus</p>

        <p>Theaters are open but the only thing out is Tenet which got incredibly meh reviews. So based on one film's performance, doomers are proclaiming that "no one wants to go to theaters right now!" Which puts pressure on the companies to release digitally instead. </p>
<p>I wish there was something to see, I'm so bored I'd definitely go. They should show popular older films to get people interested if studios wont release new projects to them.</p>
<p>But yea I agree, fuck Disney. It's just as much their fault for folding to the pressure.</p>

<p>Um...</p>
<p>They have.</p>
<p>Every theater in my area is/was playing Empire Strikes Back, Jurassic Park, Back to the Future, The Goonies, and so on. All classics. Theaters have been empty. A part of it is that people just don't go out to see old movies (yes, this is a thing, re-releases don't do very well nowadays). Also there is still a lot of fear, and people just are not going to the theaters, in spite of claims of "packed theaters" in this sub. I went to see two movies recently, and there was only about five people total both times. One being a new release, other was an old movie.</p>
