    <strong>I’m a university student who experienced a legal win against my university. I made a comment on a post a few days ago, and got so many responses that I decided to make a thread detailing how I got out of the mandate via religious exemption</strong>
    <p><p>Edit: removed name of college for my own safety</p>
<p>Brief background: I go to [redacted], which was technically allowing exemptions, but not “accepting” any. I sent over seven different attempts this summer, and all were rejected with no reason given. A group of students was able to get in contact with Liberty Counsel, an Evangelical legal non-profit. I sent the attorney all of my correspondence with [redacted], and the letter of mine that they used to include me in their a case against [redacted] was as follows (the other letters have worked for my friends at other universities, but for those facing strict mandates, Liberty Counsel easily worked with this letter) :</p>
<p>My personal religious beliefs prohibit the injection of foreign substances into my body. The Bible teaches that we shall keep the blood pure, and keep the seed from being mixed. When genetic materials from bacteria, viruses, yeast, animals, birds, and other humans are injected during vaccination, the blood is contaminated, and genetic changes occur. God warned against this. To do so would violate the teachings of the Bible. My objection to this vaccination is based on my deeply held religious beliefs. </p>
<p>The Pfizer and Moderna vaccinations, while not using morally compromised cell lines in the  design, development, or production of the vaccine, utilized a confirmatory test employing the morally compromised HEK293 cell line in order to test the efficacy of both vaccines. The HEK-293 cell line is derived from human embryonic kidney cells harvested from an aborted fetus.  Thus, both vaccines are connected to the initial evil of abortion by utilizing fetal tissue in the testing process, and to take either vaccine would support the belief that abortion is acceptable, a belief that strongly contradicts my deeply held religious convictions. </p>
<p>The AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination are even more morally compromised. The HEK-293 cell line was used in the design, development, and production stages of the AstraZeneca  vaccine, as well as for confirmatory testing.  The PER.C6 cell line, which was developed using retinal cells from an 18-week-old aborted fetus, was used in the design, development, and production stages of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, as well as for confirmatory testing.  </p>
<p>My personal religious beliefs hold abortion to be against the will of God. “Thou shalt not kill”, Scripture tells us in Exodus 20:13.</p>
<p>I would like to point out at this time that the official Vatican position on COVID-19 vaccines can be found in its entirety here, and states:
    5. At the same time, practical reason makes evident that vaccination is not, as a rule, a moral obligation and that, therefore, it must be voluntary. In any case, from the ethical point of view, the morality of vaccination depends not only on the duty to protect one's own health, but also on the duty to pursue the common good. In the absence of other means to stop or even prevent the epidemic, the common good may recommend vaccination, especially to protect the weakest and most exposed. Those who, however, for reasons of conscience, refuse vaccines produced with cell lines from aborted fetuses, must do their utmost to avoid, by other prophylactic means and appropriate behavior, becoming vehicles for the transmission of the infectious agent. In particular, they must avoid any risk to the health of those who cannot be vaccinated for medical or other reasons, and who are the most vulnerable.</p>
<p>I Corinthians 6:19 tells us that our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit. Vaccines contain neurotoxins, hazardous substances, attenuated viruses, animal parts, foreign DNA, albumin from human blood, carcinogens, and chemical wastes that are proven harmful to the body. Injection of these substances violates the word of God, and subsequently my religious beliefs. </p>
<p>I would also like to point out that I have not received any vaccination since coming of age and assuming full control over my own medical decisions. </p>
<p>For the reasons outlined above, I will continue to exercise my right to exemption from vaccination according to my religious beliefs.</p></p>

        <p>This still sets the precedent that we accept these new laws and regulations and are willing to adapt to them. </p>
<p>I'm really, really happy for you, but I'm incredibly frustrated for the people that have no religious ground to stand on. They simply don't want it. And we have no battle there besides bodily autonomy (which is being thrown in the gutter). </p>
<p>I'm glad we are fighting this, but damn it all.</p>

        <p>I'm not going to claim a religion I dont believe in to become exempt. This is all horse shit and I'm gonna stand proudly and fight this tyranny. </p>
<p>I have children. 2 that were starting preschool and kindergarten. We have to keep them out because they have mandated masks. Masks on little kids. </p>
<p>Their brains are still developing and makss increase their carbon monoxide intake. </p>
<p>This sucks. It all sucks. But we have to fight for the future, for our families. For those who cant fight for themselves. </p>
<p>This is THE fight of our lives. The time to stand against oppression and do what's right. </p>
<p>They will create a lot of desperate people as they push this forward. The world is only going to get worse before it's better.</p>

        <p>I feel you dude. My son is in preschool and is on the spectrum, so special preschool. He wouldn't wear a mask if you stapled it to his face. </p>
<p>And I dont expect anyone to agree with me when I say that's why they call him autistic. Because of his defiance. </p>

        <p>I feel glad to see parents here who have young kids too!!! God that is utterly appalling. That’s what is making me fight. I could join the  💉🐑 but wtf will that mean for our children?! Masks on little kids?! That’s disgusting, they don’t care about our children, any idiot can quickly do a Google search and see why masks are especially dangerous for children! Especially when our kids have virtually no risk of developing an infection from this <em>virus</em> and most likely either have natural immunity due to coming into contact with this one or another coronavirus (like fkn most of us) kids have to be allowed to be kids. It’s so important for their development to play and socialise and learn from people’s facial expressions like that’s how they learn how to recognise emotions and develop empathy. But no yeah suffocating children is fine. </p>
<p>What happened to all the super strict SIDS guidelines - that all the people who are now getting jabbed and pushing experimental vaccines and masks that pose a health threat to children - used to shame any parent for if one dared to use a blanket instead of a sleep sack lol or mesh bumpers in the crib… or let their baby go to sleep with a stuffed toy. Fark. It’s okay to essentially force suffocation on preschoolers tho okay yeah logical. Where did all the sanctimommies go? Are people seriously ok with this? I hope majority follow &amp; take their kids out of any school that mandates masks on children. And I hope more parents will join the fight. For our children… god. It’s beyond insane…</p>

        <p>I'm allowing my 7th grader to go to school in a mask, her mental health requires we let her go. But if they insist in vaccines I will remove her. </p>
<p>Our school superintendent sent out an email he go from the state superintendent basically saying masks are required and any school who doesnt enforce it will lose all state funding. </p>
<p>Basically a threat. He sent it out because our area is no for masks and upset, but his hands are tied. He has to follow the law. </p>
<p>My elder sister is banned from her husbands sides reunion because she will be the only unvaccinated adult. Shes devastated, she needed that support. </p>
<p>I'm having a hard time staying patient with those who support this. They are destroying our world and think they are righteous. </p>
<p>But I have hope of a positive future. We have to speak up. We have to speak for those who cant. We have to.  And I truly believe in the end, we will. </p>
<p>But the day to day is hard and worrying. I have an adult child navigating her way, a tween and little ones. It's a scary place out here for all of us. </p>
<p>But my kids will see that ik standing up for what I believe in. I wont be swayed and im prepared for the cost.</p>

        <p>A big part of the masks on kids things is to program kids to accept them. China has been making workers wear those blue medical masks in factories for many years. Its just another social control method. You wont see the upper classes and rich folks wearing them.</p>

        <p>It's a bit of a conundrum and I've been thinking the same thing, thought about faking vaccine cards or coming up with an excuse to be exempt such as religious grounds how if we are to go that route in a way we are giving in. By not making our voices heard and hiding behind excuses we are complicit in this system.</p>

        <p>I think religious exemption is not the same thing as lying.  Either are preferable to acquiescence.  It's pick your poison.  If you come and use an exemption, I think you are marking yourself for destruction if a panic ensues.  If you get caught lying, that could also be a capital offense.</p>
<p>The problem with lies is that you will have to keep lying about it to identify with people who are criminally in different to the plight of the non compliant.</p>

        <p>I wrote in another thread that there must be some sort of "doctor/patient confidentiality" law being broken here. Your medical history should be between you and your doctor, and when these companies and institutions force you to prove you have been vaccinated, they are essentially forcing you to share your medical history which technically they cannot do, as far as I know.</p>
<p>Not sure if that is an angle lawyers can use to defeat these unconscionable measures.</p>

        <p>Hey u/DeplorableStorm, just wanted to say thanks for this. When I heard you guys won this case the other day it gave me a small glimmer of hope, since I am Catholic as well, and am currently facing a job requiring it. Although my current job doesn't allow for religious exemptions, I will probably be switching to the other hospital in my area that is a Catholic hospital and does. Will be using your template &amp; case as precedent. </p>
<p>Congrats on your victory.</p>

        <p>I’m going to look for some Quran verses. I think it’ll be easy to find enough evidence to support religious exemptions based in Islam. I reverted to Islam years ago but haven’t been practicing. But I also was raised by an actual antivaxxer so haven’t had any vaccines except the tetanus one and the flu vax once… and the first shot of the gardisil (had major adverse reactions) which i think could help one’s case if they haven’t had previous vaccines… but anyway I will see what I can find. I would say maybe visit some Muslim forums and get some help to make a case for religious exemption.</p>

        <p>There have already been at least two op-eds in major publications recently regarding why we should “end religious exemptions.” I’ve been guessing that it would be coming eventually too, but to see those articles makes me wonder if it’s going to be sooner than I thought.</p>

<p>For me, I'm not going to claim a religious exemption for something which is total bullshit. I will tell these fuckers straight to their faces to take their nihilistic authoritarianism and shove it up their collective asses.</p>

        <p>Coming from a Catholic: Pope Francis is guilty of idolatry, worshipping the Pachamama. The pandemic is punishment visited onto us as punishment for idolatry. Brave Catholics destroyed the idol by throwing it into the Tiber River. This curse will not end until Pope Francis repents or dies.</p>

        <p>Thank you so much for this post!!!! I’m in the same position. I’m not religious and I’m having so much trouble trying to write a coherent, religious sounding exemption. On top of that, some schools are requiring I have a religious authority figure sign off on my letter (and it can’t be a parent). I don’t know any religious authority figures who’d be willing to sign it though. Still, this is extremely useful. Thanks again.</p>

        <p>If the Bible is the word of God, why does it contradict itself repeatedly?</p>
<p>If God is omniscient, why is he punishing people for things he would know they would do, before they did them, instead of trying to guide them on a different path? </p>
<p>Why is it that God wants everyone to follow and worship him, and will let you burn in hell if you don't, despite him supposedly giving us free will? Why punish those who use their gift, especially when you should already know what they are going to do with it? </p>
<p>Does this attitude that God shows not make him a tyrant? If a person acted in such ways, we would label them as such. </p>
<p>If God wants everyone to worship him, why doesn't he just program us that way? He "gave" us free will, but we aren't allowed to use it for fear of suffering? </p>
<p>The only half decent thing I've found to come out of the Bible is that it gives people a reason to be good people, however in practice, Christians come off as some of the most hateful individuals, judging everyone who does things that doesn't conform to their religious "beliefs," while also ignoring other parts of the Bible.</p>

        <p>It sounds like you’ve been listening to preachers instead of reading the Bible.  </p>
<p>Did Judas have free will?   I bet if you had asked him he would have said yes, except he was created specifically for the purpose he served.  </p>
<p>What is the punishment for sin?  Is it eternal damnation?  Or is it death?   If Jesus died for our sins then what punishment is there left?   Ephesians 3:18-19.  His love is there for you whether you want it or not.  But it’s a much happier life when you want it.</p>

        <p>I haven't listened to a preacher in a LONG time. It sounds like you don't have answers, for there is no reasonable explanation for an omniscient being to be contradicting itself. </p>
<p>None of what you said even comes close to an attempt at answering any of my questions. </p>
<p>Did God give us free will or not? If so, why are people punished when they use it? If not, the same question applies, but with even worse implications. If we are not free of mind, then why are we punished for doing what we are supposed to do? </p>
<p>How did Jesus being crucified by the Romans clear anyone of their sins? What kind of message does sacrificing an innocent person to save the guilty send? </p>
<p>It makes ZERO sense, until you think of what this book written by man has done.</p>
