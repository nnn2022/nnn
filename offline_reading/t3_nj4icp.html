    <strong>You are not alone.</strong>
    <p><p>I had the most refreshing day yesterday. </p>
<p>My partner and I hosted a BBQ. </p>
<p>We invited 20+ people. </p>
<p>Only 5 showed up. </p>
<p>The others were all scared of covid. </p>
<p>We had such a good time the few of us. We were all on the same page about things going on. We have all been working outSide our homes in lockdown. You know, out in the real world. Whereas most of the others who didn't come have been inside at home absorbing propaganda. </p>
<p>We drank, we laughed, we listened to music, we chatted about all sorts of things. We ate food. We hugged at the end. </p>
<p>The funny thing is, we probably wouldn't call the people we met up with our main friend group. But because they came we got to know them and now we have something in common too. </p>
<p>But it was so refreshing. Not feeling stifled when talking. Able to talk and chat freely about our opinions. </p>
<p>I didn't honestly think they'd be completely on the same page as us. </p>
<p>So I just want to say. If you are worried no one will come to your social events, there are people who will. Not everyone had swallowed the bullshit and use it as an opportunity to make new friends. Invite everyone you know if you have to even if you guys don't talk much or are just friends of friends. </p>
<p>We agreed yesterday that the affects of lockdown have been shocking on the people we know. Mentally and physically and economically. </p>
<p>There are probably people out there who are just as desperate as you to meet up and you are not alone in your thinking. </p>
<p>There are people who are compliant just because they lost their jobs and can't afford the fines. They'll show their real beliefs when they get invited.</p></p>

        <p>I know alot of people in the the town I live in. Covid helped me realize who my real friends are and who would rat me out to the government over a BBQ party.  It's a whole new dynamic.</p>

        <p>It's important to get out and do things. Once your out and about you realise that outside is just the same as it ever was. The birds still sing, the grass is still green, the clouds still fly by over head and the flowers and leaves still come out in the spring. </p>
<p>We will come through this stronger and better off that those who choose to live in fear. They've been brainwashed. They're essentially sick themselves. Sick in the mind. They've been abused emotionally for the past year. We have to coax them out and lead by example.</p>

        <p>It‚Äôs sadly the same for the other group of friends that didn‚Äôt show up. You‚Äôre probably going to be labeled a crazy person and they‚Äôll probably never bother seeing you again. Covid has separated people further than politics.</p>

        <p>That must've felt amazing to enjoy some normal healthy human interaction again! </p>
<p>I've been having get togethers including weekends up in a cabin in the mountains since this whole thing started. What's funny is even the friends who wore their masks regularly, got tested, got the vaccine and were obedient to the overlords did not wear a mask around me and my husband. I never preached to them my beliefs but they just knew we weren't buying the narrative. It's funny how much people's actions are shaped by what people think of them!</p>
