        <p>covid is a virus. Not a parasite. There is a difference. Viruses still kill, but they cant kill more people then they infect or it will die out. A parasite cannot kill their individual host because they need the host to live.</p>
<p>It is possible that covid can mutate to become more lethal but its chances of survival diminish.</p>

        <p>&rt; It is possible that covid can mutate to become more lethal but its chances of survival diminish.</p>
<p>Enter: Natural selection. As its chances of survival diminish, it will be out competed by more 'successful' variants. That is why over time, as the tweet in the OP stated, the dominant virus variants become less lethal.</p>

        <p>Yes but the virus can still go through more lethal mutations. Despite them not living as long as less lethal/more infectious variants, they still have the ability to be transmitted to people and kill them before the variant dies out.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how much more lethal covid strains can become before starting to noticeably die off but I really don't want to wait around and find out. For the sake of me and the people around me. People are still dying and its not even that lethal, just very infectious. Be sure to get vaccinated so this can end.</p>

<p>Dont get vaccinated &rt;&rt; vaccine continues to spread &rt;&rt; more people die &rt;&rt; virus continues to infect for months/years &rt;&rt; restrictions continue &rt;&rt; living with covid eventually becomes the new normal you are against in this sub</p>

        <p>Wrong. We don't want the new normal of requiring expiremental vaccines that don't confer immunity, only reduced symptoms. We don't want mask mandates that don't work.</p>
<p>We want the old normal. The one that got us through Zika, Spanish flu, Asian flu, swine flu, SARS, MERS, etc. The one that didn't require lockdowns. The one that didn't require mask mandates. The one that didn't require vaccines. That old normal. That's what we want back.</p>

Yea what could go wrong if we just repeat history? I'm sure nothing bad has ever happened from repeating history right?  </p>
<p>The covid vaccine isn't experimental and its not required either. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18071662/">The research dates back to the mid-late 2000s</a>.   </p>
<p>This isnt the 1900s. Science has evolved. I thought the new normal this sub wants was just pre-covid times. But apparently all of you want to got back to a time where the TV hasnt even been invented or maybe to a time when WWII hasnt ended yet or something. Wake up, the world is changing. You can either keep living in your bubble and block out anything that screams change or you can change with it.</p>

<p>But as you say, they will die out, and they are competing with other more successful strains. Its really really difficult for a random mutation to do much harm on its own.</p>
<p>&rt;Be sure to get vaccinated so this can end.</p>
<p>This will never end. Since you can still carry the virus and supposedly infect others, random mutations will still happen even if you're vaccinated. And guess what? You'll spread the mutations that are more resistant to the vaccine. The best we can hope for is that the virus mutates into a more benign variant, just as it happened with the Spanish flu. The target is herd-immunity, and that can be accomplished via natural infection as well.</p>
<p>Again: We will never ever manage to exterminate this virus. Ever. That's the misunderstanding that keeps this divide alive.</p>

        <p>Fair points, I was just asking myself "But how do viruses become deadly in nature in the first place?".</p>
<p>Each and every new strain of covid being more deadly than the last, can we agree that is very farfetched and simply fearmongering? I can agree a virus can become more deadly, but that does not mean the news media is correct in reporting it as fact simply because a scientist said "This new strain could be more deadly" as a possibility.</p>
<p>And can you see why people would distrust the statement that the Delta variant is more deadly, while at the same time it causes "Cold like symptoms of headache, sore throat, running nose"?  😓</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Be sure to get vaccinated so this can end.</p>
<p>No, thank you. Friendly critique: people here have probably felt pressure to vax throughout this whole ordeal, and that has been part of what is leading them to their current beliefs and subreddit. Further pressure or suggestions to do so will only result in pushback, imo. The socratic method is the only way to go!</p>

        <p>Stop putting words in my mouth. This is not fearmongering. This is based on the POSSIBILITY that it CAN mutate to become more lethal.</p>
<p>“Each new strain of covid being more deadly then then last” </p>
<p>I never once said this and it is not true. It is far fetched, and yea it is fearmongering </p>
<p>“Because a scientist said ‘the new strain could be more deadly’ as a possibility</p>
<p>I would trust a scientist more then anyone who’s not a scientist. It MAY be more deadly but it could only be marginally/insignificantly more lethal and they exclude that info for the sake of sensationalising it. It really depends on what source you get it from. Some are shit, some are ok.</p>

<p>Many people who have gotten the vaccine have also gotten Covid. Getting the vaccine obviously will not make this end if it can’t even prevent you from getting the virus.</p>

<p>That's not necessarily true. Parasitoidism results in the death of the host because it is no longer necessary for the survival of the parasite or the death of the host will benefit the parasite.</p>

        <p>Covid-19 is a respiratory disease, SARS-CoV-2 is a virus. You're correct on theory, a virus can mutate to become more lethal, and that will eventually limit its spread.</p>
<p>I'm however highly skeptical that the same mutation can make covid simultaneously more transmissible and more lethal, given the claimed method of propagation of the virus by people with mild symptoms. If a variant is faster to spread, then it most likely does so by causing fewer symptoms and thus remaining undetected longer. Fewer symptoms means less deadly in the end.</p>

        <p>Miller’s rachet is not this — viruses actually have recombination it’s how early gain of function was performed at a very coarse level (put two coronavirus in the same cell get recombined genetics) - absolutely viruses become less deadly as they mutate but it’s not due to mutation meltdown - it’s due to evolutionary funneling, recombination with existing viruses, and a variety of other factors but I wouldn’t personally consider viruses to be asexually reproduced due to those factors</p>

        <p>RNG plays nice every now and again. And, the rare amimal-to-human viruses do tend to be nasty. Yet we're met with Occam's Razor; A natural mutation, or an existing organism from a lab that develops exactly this sort of thing which also happens to be mere miles from the wet-market... Its no-contest, in terms of probabilities. Beneficial mutation is rare. Whilst we've been employing gain-of-function on Coronaviruses for at least a decade.</p>

<p>A scientific theory is different than a theory like “I have a theory about who ate the last cookie” or a conspiracy theory. Gravity is a theory. I am absolutely certain than anywhere on earth, if someone jumps out of a window they will fall towards earth.</p>

<p>&rt;Evolution is change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations. These characteristics are the expressions of genes that are passed on from parent to offspring during reproduction. Different characteristics tend to exist within any given population as a result of mutation, genetic recombination and other sources of genetic variation. Evolution occurs when evolutionary processes such as natural selection (including sexual selection) and genetic drift act on this variation, resulting in certain characteristics becoming more common or rare within a population.</p>

        <p>HIV didn't kill its host outright in the 80's as well. It's a virus with three clinical phases, the second (latent) one can be 2 years long but it can be 20 years as well, depending on the host. The reason HIV - positive people live that long nowadays is called antiretroviral therapy.</p>

        <p>But see, that is why they call this a “novel” virus - it throws every thing we know about viruses out the window!  We have no immunity to it, which is why it kills instantly.  It is blocked by a simple piece of cloth with holes 1,000x bigger than it.  As soon as one person gets it, an entire state/country needs to shutdown ASAP or else everyone would be dropping dead in the streets (like early video/pictures showed).  Novel. Virus.  It’s in the name.</p>
<p>So we have/need a new kind of science to handle this.  The new science:  if you gather for a worthy cause, you are safe.  If everyone has just been given a small amount of freedom back, then the virus mutates and becomes stronger.  The charts show locking down and mask usage do not correspond to up or down ticks, but do align with political motives.</p>
<p>Therefore, I for one, 100% believe that this variant is 100x more deadly and 100x more transmissible, and requires 100% of the world to lockdown today, or else we’ll all be dead within a week.  I’m glad the health organizations are here to help, so we might live another day free of this scourge.</p>

        <p>It's not the bioweapon, COVID was the setup jab for the haymaker. </p>
<p>The plan was to slowly grind people and society down. Get people tired, get them desperate, get them not even thinking anymore... Take them right to the edge of sanity, then let them off the hook for a few months.</p>
<p>Give them a taste of freedom. Let them remember what they're missing, let them think that it's all in the rearview mirror... And THEN unleash the bioweapon.</p>
<p>The one that is just absolutely going to tear through the now-mollified immune systems of vaccinated people.</p>
<p>This time the death counts will be real and terrified, vaccinated people will run to get their booster shots as governments mandate forced vaccination and sink even deeper into lockdown. Unrest grows and police are given more powers to detain and arrest.</p>
<p>Bodies start piling up and the health system collapses.</p>
<p>Then the financial system collapses.</p>
<p>Then governments start to fall.</p>
<p>Then we're alone and left to fend for ourselves. And shit gets way worse.</p>
<p>Once things fall completely off the rails for a few years, the elites saunter back in with a promise of order and safety that just happens to come with the one world government that was the core part of the plan since the start.</p>
<p>And anyone who doesn't want to take part is just left to rot, weeding themselves out of the future gene pool while they build the new world on the backs of our children's brainwashed children.</p>
<p>You get serfdom forever, they get everything and are free to reshape the human race as they see fit.</p>
<p>It sounds almost silly, like someone read a dystopian YA novel but considering they consider most of humanity "useless eaters" they feel entirely justified in tearing it all down and saving more resources for themselves and the 'people who need them'.</p>

        <p>Yes but how much population do you need, that's the question. If the human population is kept at 500,000,000 like they say they want that will easily support the 10,000 or so at the top.</p>

        <p>Yes, but that assumes we're dealing with a single engineered virus that is released and left to do as it will... and not multiple engineered variants, each more harmful than the last to mimic a single virus getting worse over time.</p>

        <p>I get the point but it's wrong. Mutation is exactly that, not design but chance.</p>
<p>Coronaviruses aren't new, and most of them are basically innocuous (and I'd put covid in that category). However, SARS and MERS are perfect examples of a previously manageable illness turning deadly as a direct result of mutation.</p>
<p>Covid has animal reservoirs just like any coronavirus does. Covid spreads like crazy so it has a huge footprint. It is in some of the dirtiest countries in the world. And to top it all off our lockdowns are making people's immunity weaker. It only takes one stroke of bad luck in mutation to make something very deadly indeed.</p>
<p>All of that being said, I'm royally over the hygiene/illness driven hysteria. We live in a world with illness and death and we always have. We have been lucky to live under the shelter of antibiotics and better medical care that prior generations didn't have but that doesn't change the basic facts. We are born, we live, and we die. And thanks to our better nutrition, sanitation, and medicine most of us will die from illness rather than old age. That is what life is, and people need to fucking get used to it instead of freaking out that diseases exist.</p>

        <p>Yes, viruses will sometimes not replicate correctly. These are the mutations. They contain basically the same genetic makeup as the original. The small percentile of changes doesn't automatically make it more deadly (it's less than 1 percent)</p>

        <p>it's actually very possible (highly probable actually) that there have been and will be subsequent mutations of covid that become more lethal and more contagious to humans</p>
<p>this is because covid is not a real virus. it was designed and manufactured in a laboratory and tested on mice and other non-human animals. until it was leaked from the lab into the real world, this virus had never even come into contact with humans</p>
<p>we should <em>expect</em> subsequent more dangerous mutations of covid, even after this "delta variant." this is why lying and covering up stuff like the lab leak is such a big fucking deal. it's pretty hard for the actual scientists to do actual "science" when everyone is instead participating in a massive completely unnecessary and harmful cover-up so that the bad orange man won't win an election</p>

        <p>This is true but only if we had allowed to virus to play out naturally without mass injecting vaccines in a mad rush in the middle of a pandemic. This virus was naturally becoming less lethal over time. There was never any need to produce a vaccine for it. I have a very bad feeling something incredibly sinister is behind this "pandemic" and subsequent  vaccine roll out. It seems the goal is global mass depopulation by means of a spike protein bio weapon induced by vaccines. It is becoming clearer and clearer that the virus was not made to be the bio weapon, it was made to justify the vaccines, and the bio weapon is the spike protein. I really hope and pray that I am wrong about this but sadly I don't think that I am.  These variants caused by the mass vaccine rollout in the middle of a pandemic will be increasingly harmful against vaccinated people, but will be blamed on the unvaccinated.</p>

I've already made deals with 5-6 people since March last year, since they doomed me for not using a mask. Or stayed home. 
And I'm still here, 15 months later. Still no mask. Still working front line. No vaccine.</p>
<p>How about this. If we both live July 2023, we meet somewhere, and get drunk and have some laughs.

        <p>Eh.</p>
<p>99.9% yes. However, sometimes they do become more lethal. Spanish flu was a flu variant.</p>
<p>If viruses always got less and less deadly we'd have no viral disease.</p>
<p>But yeah, the chances of each mutation getting deadlier is extremely unlikely. We should be allowing the higher transmission virus to sweep through and naturally inoculate. </p>
<p>Over 70,000 delta cases and only 114 deaths, all over 50, and 73% of those deaths were partially or fully vaxxed.</p>
<p>When will people admit, vaccine or not, old and very ill people will die.</p>
<p>It's sad, but let's not close society and rush in hyperinflation to screw over every younger generation for half a century...</p>
<p>Oh wait, too late...</p>

<p>Delta variant looks to be less deadly but infects younger people more.</p>

<li>
<p>Not sure whether this is nonsense and they want young to be vaxxed so the variant coincidentally happens to attack young just as all nations roll out their child jabs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It could be genuine, that so many adults are vaxxed the virus needed to find a new host supply - children.</p>

<p>Either way it seems to be less deadly or just as deadly as before - which was statistically negligable in children.</p>

        <p>Something from my biology notes in 10th grade:</p>
<p>Three types of point mutations include;  Silent mutations, Missense mutations, and nonsense mutations. </p>
<p>Silent mutations are mutated codon codes for the same amino acid, and they have no effect. </p>
<p>Missense mutations are mutated codon codes for a different amino acid, and they have variable effects. Nonsense mutations are premature stop codons and they are usually serious mutations.</p>
<p>A frameshift mutation is a deletion or insertion of one or more nucleotide that changes the reading frame of the base sequence.</p>

        <p>Actually viruses *do* evolve to be deadlier.  This tweet is either fake, or this person is an MD of some random body part not related to virology.</p>
<p>You ever hear of drug-resistant viruses and bacteria evolving in hospitals?  Where the place is packed with antibiotics, but nonetheless some of the disease survives?  We hear all the time about drug-resistant diseases being a reality.  It's not some conspiracy hosted by George Siros and/ or Bill Gates to... put tracking chips in people?</p>
<p>Thing is, viruses aren't smart enough to strategize.  If they evolve to be deadlier, all that matters is that they're able to spread. IE, you have a bunch of jackasses who equate mask-wearing to Jewish death camps in WW2.  Anyone in this sub want to disavow that?... I didn't think so.</p>
<p>On that note: OP's great-grandfather receives great news:</p>
<p>"We can vaccinate your kids against polio, mumps and rubella!  It's a scientific miracle, they won't have to die--"</p>
<p>"NO! That's the devil's work! I had cowpox when I was little and I turned out fine.  That 'polio vaccine' probably makes you into a communist anyway."</p>
<p>Later, OP's grandfather survives but his 14 brothers and sisters all die before the age of 4.</p>

        <p>It's almost right. He's close. Viruses over time will not evolve to be more deadly because virtually every evolutionary selective pressure pushes the other way. But this is drawn out over a long span of time. Viruses will mutate and become more deadly but they'll be out competed by less lethal viruses that occupy the same, for lack of a better word, niche since they're going to be less effective at spreading having killed their host. So at face value it's incorrect, but a respiratory disease like this will trend downward in lethality over the decades. It certainly wouldn't stop a mutation to get started that is more deadly in the short-term though especially with how contagious and benign COVID is. With how infrequently it kills, it's not like the host isn't going to be able to spread a slightly more deadly version unlike the case with MERS.</p>
<p>He's got the right principle but a fundamental and fatal misunderstanding of it. It's like a guy that just learned stats saying something is impossible because it falls outside three standard deviations from the mean. Well, no, but you're on the right track.</p>
<p>&rt; please please stick to the strong arguments about civil liberties and individual rights and leave the stupidity out of it</p>
<p>I completely agree. This sub is pretty bad when it comes to accepting anything that disagrees with the media narrative. Like, 80% of the time it works out. 20% of the time you get half-truths and browbeating. It would be better to just point out the vaccine is effective against delta and anyone who doesn't want it knows the risk. 0 reason to make any policy over it.</p>

        <p>That doesn’t even make sense. Viral mutation happens in many ways including random mutations due to replication errors and recombination.</p>
<p>Y’all are just gonna ignore the existence of SARs and MERs? What about things like MRSA, it’s a bacteria but obviously things are able to mutate to more dangerous versions</p>
<p>It’s not a sim character - there aren’t a set number of ‘character points’ that viruses distribute between transmission and lethality.</p>

        <p>Heh this is bullshit. It's not like viruses sit there and think about what their next move is. Mutations are random. Viruses that don't become more deadly are statistically more likely to survive than those who do but that's the best you get. Over time the most successful viruses become mild or may even integrate themselves into the genome. This is not a guarantee though or Ebola would have calmed down by now.</p>

        <p>In the history of virology, there has never, EVER, been a man-made gain of function coronavirus bio-weapon released from a communist Chinese laboratory.</p>
<p>What evidence is there that the virus is becoming less lethal? Look at countries like Brazil and India. Their first waves were much less deadly. After the virus mutated, it became more deadly.</p>
<p>Maybe had we not introduced vaccines to the equation, the virus would have become less lethal... but we entered into an arms race with the virus. The vaccines created the ideal conditions for these variants to form. This is exactly what Geert Vanden Bossche said would happen. Never before in history have we tried a mass vaccination campaign in the middle of a pandemic. So this is an unprecedented situation.</p>
<p>With this virus, it spreads more when it makes people sick. If people show barely any symptoms, they don't spread the virus as well. If it makes people very sick, that's when it spreads more. So if this virus wants to spread more, it needs to make people more sick... and that will increase the mortality.</p>
<p>Also, with the Spanish Flu... the second wave was far more lethal than the first wave. So doesn't that fact alone disprove this tweet? Why was the second wave of the Spanish flu much more deadly than the first wave? If this tweet was accurate, wouldn't the second wave of the Spanish flu virus have been less deadly?</p>
<p>We've only been dealing with COVID for a bit over a year now. Maybe this was all one giant first wave, and just like the Spanish flu, it will become more lethal now in year #2.</p>

        <p>Just look at the graphs for the countries that have spawned the variants. Look at the graphs for Brazil, India, UK, South Africa, etc. You can see on the graphs that cases and deaths rise and fall in waves. The second wave which involved these variants had much higher cases and deaths. So deaths are higher with the variants, not lower. </p>
<p>I suppose you could still argue that the variants are more transmissible but less lethal. Therefore, if you have a mutation, you'll get 4x the number of cases, but only 3x the number of deaths. So that could still be possible. Maybe the deaths are only higher because the cases are way higher. 4x the cases and 3x the deaths is better than 4x the cases and 5x the deaths. But either way, you can still get more people dying.</p>
<p>In my opinion, I think they are more transmissible and more deadly. The reason I think this is because the virus transmits better by making people sicker. But even if this is wrong, you can still end up with more people dying if the virus is much more transmissible, but only slightly less lethal. I think it's way too early to be able to say anything for certain... but my guess is that the variants are both more transmissible and more lethal.</p>

        <p>Spanish Flu mutated to be more deadly because of the extremely abnormal conditions of the trenches of WWI which concentrated those too sick to participate on the frontlines making more deadly mutations spread more than less deadly ones.</p>
<p>Once the virus was in civilian populations, it mutated to be less dangerous because it was subjected to the usual pressures of more deadly mutations naturally isolating instead of being crammed together by military medical care in one of the worst hells to ever exist on Earth.</p>
<p>So viruses can mutate to be more deadly... under extremely specifically circumstances that haven't existed in the world for over a century.</p>

        <p>I came here to ask about this honestly, but I researched it a little instead. </p>
<p>The Spanish flu did mutate to be much more lethal. The lethality part was that it “targeted” young adults with healthy immune systems, causing <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine_storm">hypercytokinemia</a> or inflammation of organs (sound similar to something else right now?). It also did not kill fast, but was a longer drawn out death. </p>
<p>The war, lots of slow troop movement around the world, very poor hygiene, close quarters in hospitals, active young adults at higher risk, slow deaths, water contamination, etc is what contributed to the spread. </p>
<p>I couldn’t find anything saying any of the strains were more contagious or less contagious. However, the entire “wave” of the deadliest one was measured in months. This is even with all the easy ways to spread.</p>
<p>There’s not much I saw about how it went away. I guess it was because people with it either died or became immune, like most other viruses.  Either way, it stopped the spreading to more people.</p>

        <p>Are you just ignoring the fact that the spanish flu clearly mutated into something worse in its 2nd and 3rd waves?  </p>
<p>How did it end? It ended with 50 million people dying. Scaled up to today’s population, that’d be 200 million deaths.</p>
