    <strong>Can someone explain Iran to me?</strong>
    <p><p>I've compiled a good mental list of things to say when talking to authoritarian covidians but one thing that still stumps me is Iran.</p>
<p>Every day there's someone saying their relative died from it or they saw people visiting covid graves when visiting their great-grandparents graves. Everyone I know who lives in Iran is saying something about someone they know dying. There's also that whole issue of satellite photos of people building a mass grave in Iran when this whole thing started last year. I can't find any data on death rates or infection rates regarding Iran's population either. A similar thing happened with India but there was plenty of data to disprove the covid stuff there but I can't find any information on Iran.</p>
<p>I tried asking for exact names and ages each time they mention an acquaintance dying and they actually provide a fully detailed answer (although admittedly they could be making it up).</p>
<p>Covid is probably just the flu wince the PCR test can't differentiate between them but that doesn't explain much. I want to say because of poor nutrition and healthcare, the covid death rate is higher in Iran than here but that doesn't explain the 0.01735% death rate of the flu.</p>
<p>I don't want to get too tinfoilly here but I suspect an actual bioweapon was released in contested 3rd world countries like Iran, who has been historically harassed by virtually every nearby neighbor and world power like China, Russia, US, etc. Or maybe the hospitals are still killing people with ventilators like they did here in the states.</p>
<p>Can anyone help me solve this or know what I should say in rebuttal? Thanks.</p></p>

        <p>I haven't looked into it but my family is Iranian and we still have many relatives over there. My mother keeps hearing the same line - that a disease is running rampant and killing many people. I'll be following this thread because I'd really like to know, too. Iran is my ancestral homeland and our people have been suffering under mullah dictatorship for over 40 years. Who knows what clamp downs they've instituted to perpetuate fear and panic?</p>

        <p>Maybe theyâ€™re just taking advantage to remove dissidents of the regime like China</p>
<p>I also heard that Iran slowed down their internet because it would stop covid </p>
<p>Made me think it was 5g for a while</p>

        <p>I've got tonnes of Iranian friends and I have never been able to debunk them either. Two friends claimed that at least one of their parents got C19 and ended up on a ventilator for weeks on end. Whilst Iranians are not the leanest Middle Easterners, I am aware that their quality of life has imploded recently along with the healthcare system. If you remember from last year, many high-ranking imam succumbed to what was attributed to C19.</p>
