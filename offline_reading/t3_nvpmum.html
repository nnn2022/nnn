        <p>Can you please share a medical study that was peer reviewed showing that people who have had covid-19 then recovered need to be vaccinated, or get benefit from it?</p>
<p>Preferably one that came out before the rhetoric started to vaccinate everyone</p>

        <p>I'm afraid you're wrong.</p>
<p>I'll just quote a few things</p>
<p>"We did a paper 6 months ago which studied people who had died from COVID. So this was a very serious disease. And their lymph nodes had no germinal centers, which means no memory B cells to SARS-CoV-2. Even though they had antibodies, they had very low affinity antibodies.</p>
<p>And so the outcome of that was the idea that if you have a very serious disease, then you're not likely to have a long memory response. Now, those are people who died. So we don't know how it applies to people who have lived because they were able to take out their lymph nodes and study them. And it's not so easy to do in people who have survived. So a natural infection can have consequences. So, on the one hand, yes, you make a lot of viral proteins and those are great epitopes for mainly T cells because I think most of the antibodies that are going to block infection are going to be spike directed. But any other viral protein could in theory be a T-cell target. So you'll get more epitopes.
The counter view is that the virus may encode immune antagonists that could alter the immune response in some way that's not as good as, say, a vaccine. So it really depends. And we don't know enough yet. So I think if people are making a blanket statement that natural infection is always better, that's not always correct. It really depends on the virus."</p>
<p>" Volunteers who received the Moderna shot had more antibodies — one marker of immune response — in their blood than did people who had been sick with Covid-19."</p>
<p>" Natural immunity from the coronavirus is fortunately quite strong. A vast majority of people infected produce at least some antibodies and immune cells that can fight off the infection. And the evidence so far suggests that this protection will persist for years, preventing serious illness, if not reinfection.
But there is a “massive dynamic range” in that immune response, with a 200-fold difference in antibody levels.
In people who are only mildly ill, the immune protection that can prevent a second infection may wane within a few months. “Those people might benefit more from the vaccine than others would,” said Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
The diversity in the immune response from natural infection might be because of differences in the amount of virus to which the person was exposed."</p>
<p>https://www.contagionlive.com/view/immune-response-from-mrna-covid-19-vaccines-is-more-robust-than-natural-infection</p>
<p>The antibody response induced by mRNA vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is stronger and more variable than that of natural infection, a new study found.</p>

        <p>&rt;"We did a paper 6 months ago which studied people who had died from COVID. So this was a very serious disease. And their lymph nodes had no germinal centers, which means no memory B cells to SARS-CoV-2. Even though they had antibodies, they had very low affinity antibodies.</p>
<p>People who died of a disease had an improper or inferior immune response!  Egad!  This goes in the "no shit" file and is about as worthless as excrement.   Which it seems like you said later.  So, why bring it up?   We need to talk about the people who survived Covid.  They have long lasting immunity.  No vaccine required.</p>
<p>&rt;In people who are only mildly ill, the immune protection that can prevent a second infection may wane within a few months.</p>
<p>Think about how little sense this makes.  If people fell only mildly ill, then doesn't it stand to reason their immune system was better equipped to fight Covid in the first place?  These people fought off the first infection like it was a cold.  There's no reason to believe a second exposure to the same virus would be even as severe, much less more severe.  This is basic immunology.</p>
<p>In fact, it seems people already had some immunity to Covid before Covid even existed because it's similar enough to other coronaviruses.  Again, no vaccine required.</p>
