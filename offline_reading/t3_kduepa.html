    <strong>If you ask why you’re a selfish ignorant bigot</strong>
    <p><p>If I dare question anything about this <em>pandemic</em> on any other subreddit I’m instantly downvoted and yelled at. “Why a lockdown this time but not for SARS?” “Why are they heavily pushing us to get a rushed vaccine?” “Why did they remove liability from the vaccine’s creators?” “Why are people being arrested for not wearing a mask in some countries if it’s not a law?” Op, I’m basically Hitler now. At least half the population are ignorant gullible NPCs that just do whatever their programers and overlords say. In the beginning, “masks do nothing there’s no point in wearing one.” Now, “WEAR A MASK YOU SELFISH BIGOT! YOU’RE GONNA KILL ME AND MY GRANDMA!” A lot of people can’t think for themselves and it’s kinda scary.</p>
<p>Socrates was executed for telling the youth to question authority. It seems like history is repeating itself again.</p></p>

        <p>Yes, the hivemind of reddit. Most people are incapable of critical thinking and rely heavily on their emotions and go off whatever the rest of the herd is saying. People die of all sorts of non-covid related things every day like car accidents and yet I notice there is not a sizable portion of the population calling for cars to be banned and whinging about you being selfish if you drive a car which just highlights how these people have been manipulated, no reasoning with them over the internet whatsoever. They will happily jump off the side of the cliff together.</p>

        <p>I got permanently banned from covidiots for asking where I can find the 2% death rate objectively stated. I have never cussed on there or called anyone a moron or wished death on anyone. But i got permanently banned today after asking that question. I replied "why?" to the ban message and still haven't gotten a response. It is ironic because a lot of people come to this sub from covidiots and use terrible language and obviously troll, but they claim we are the ones who ban anyone disagreeing with them. I didn't even disagree! I only asked a question. I hope they realize this behavior actually alienates more people from their cause than drawing people towards them...</p>

        <p>Not really related to covid but I once got permanently banned from a conspiracy subreddit because a mod replied to my comment arguing and swearing at me. I didn’t know it was a mod at the time so I responded, not even stooping down to their level and then they banned me. When I messaged the mods asking why I was banned, that person replied back laughing and then blocked me. It’s very dangerous when fascists get any position of power.</p>

        <p>They can think for themselves, their thoughts are just trash ("everyone should sacrifice to protect me from the risk I perceive as bigger to me!") so they invent a virtuous, heroic persona to hide that and pretend we're the selfish ones for bringing up situations besides their own.</p>
<p>For instance, the World Food Programme's projections for lockdown-related famine. If you ask, "do a hundred million people really need to starve to make you feel secure? Couldn't we just shield those medical authorities agree are <em>actually</em> vulnerable?" they almost wind their necks in.</p>

        <p>&rt; Socrates was executed for telling the youth to question authority</p>
<p>he, loathed 'democracy' and thought voting to select political leaders was absurd and the worst way to select them.</p>
<p>note that his execution was voted for and it wasn't even a majority, iirc 50 out 500+ votes were for his death. </p>
<p>they made him commit suicide via hemlock poisoning. i think he was in his late 70s- early 80s too.</p>

        <p>what point are you attempting to get across with your OP? </p>
<p>socrates was accused and deemed to be guilty of sedition</p>
<p>you say history is repeating, yet when in history have entire populations of otherwise healthy people been quarantined? this is the first time ever, that i am aware of.</p>

        <p>I got told that I didn’t support BLM because I thought someone who confronted two guys not wearing masks in a grocery store and followed them to their car was the aggressor and not the victim. </p>
<p>Then they started saying telling me that I believed in this other brutal stuff that I didn’t know about and it made me cry. So I never went back to that sub.</p>
