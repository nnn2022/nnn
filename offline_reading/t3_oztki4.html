    <strong>A question as a vaccinated French person</strong>
    <p><p>From what I saw on this subreddit, you're pretty anti government and stuff.. but why ? Why do you think the governments are against you, are putting whole countries in lockdown, causing huge economic issues if covid isn't that much of a problem ?
By the way, this is a real question, I really want to know why, not here to do propaganda or things like that huh?</p></p>

        <p>I am not against the government. I am just against the government infringing on my personal freedoms, individual liberty, and human rights. I am against authoritarian governments, and right now, that seems to be all of them.</p>

        <p>You see my friend, in the United States, the federal government has been known to use crises (even sometimes purposely creates crises) as an excuse to take away individual rights and freedoms.</p>
<p>They know that they can’t just go on and take everyone’s rights but if they use a crisis as an excuse it will make it a lot easier for them. That’s one basic explanation.</p>

        <p>For example, gun control. The second amendment allows US citizens to own weapons and it specifically says in the document “the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall NOT BE INFRINGED”.</p>
<p>Which means that the government passing gun control in an attempt to limit/block people from owning guns is a serious abuse of power and is quite literally taking away rights.</p>

        <p>The purpose of this amendment was to "to allow the creation of civilian forces that can counteract a tyrannical federal government", and add you probably saw, there are a LOT more gun murders in the us than anywhere in the world (1.4 million people died from gun homicide in the us between 1968 and 2011 which is 1/20900, whereas in UK the ratio is of 1/7000000)</p>
<p>(From Wikipedia:) Gun control is influenced there by the gun lobby (National Rifle Association, NRA), which relies on the second part of the Second Amendment to the American Constitution, while failing to recall its first part (which  contextualize by recalling that it aims to allow the existence of an armed community designated as a "well-organized militia" [64] intended to protect a "free state" [65]);  It is also easy to move around with a weapon.  Thus, the perpetrator of the Charleston massacre used the pistol he received as a birthday present for his 21st birthday [66] and, at the same time, the government of Texas allowed the carrying of weapons to students in  all state campuses as of August 1, 2016.</p>

        <p>“A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/amendment-2/">infringed</a>.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/08/16/what-the-data-says-about-gun-deaths-in-the-u-s/?amp=1">Additional Source</a>. </p>
<p>Also using statistics from 1968-2011 is extremely disingenuous and doesn’t show the full story. Most gun deaths that occur in the US are suicides. <a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/what-you-can-do/facts.html">60% of gun deaths in 2019 were from suicide and only 37% were from homicides</a>. </p>
<p>In America guns are used more to commit suicide rather than homicides. And also guns aren’t as prevalent as you think. The source also states that only 31% of American households have guns.</p>
<p>“Compared with other countries</p>
<p>The U.S. has relatively low rates of assaultive violence but high firearm mortality rates in comparison with other industrialized nations.4</p>
<p>Risk and safety</p>
<p>Research has found that individuals with risk factors for firearm injury and death are less likely to safely store their firearms when compared to firearm owners without these risk factors.5,6</p>
<p>Trends in firearm injury and death</p>
<p>Overall since 2006, firearm homicides in the U.S. have decreased, but the number of firearm suicides has increased by a similar amount.4</p>
<p>Even when firearm homicide rates were at their highest in the mid-1990s (just above 7/100,000 population), they were not higher than those for firearm suicide.”</p>
<p>But now we’re a little off-topic. Owning Guns is a right and since the amendment states that right “Shall not be infringed” any attempt to limit/block them is taking away rights.</p>

        <p>Well….   The US government has a fairly long history of conducting various experiments on unknowing citizens. </p>

<p>They’ve also shown a willingness and capacity to use false flag events and propagandistic misinformation to justify military actions.  </p>
<p>The Vietnam war was based on a supposed attack in the gulf of Tonkin which never actually took place.   This was used to draft 2.2 million Americans into active duty service. Nearly 60,000 of which were killed in action. The war also resulted in millions of civilian casualties</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Tonkin_incident</p>
<p>The Iraq invasion was again based on misinformation and resulted in the estimated deaths of nearly  500,000 people </p>
<p>https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/03/22/iraq-war-wmds-an-intelligence-failure-or-white-house-spin/</p>
<p>All in all, governments around the world have committed horrible atrocities on their own citizens resulting in hundreds of millions of deaths over the last century </p>
<p>https://hawaii.edu/powerkills/NOTE1.HTM</p>
<p>Do you need more? Or is a few hundred million lives adversely effected or downright snuffed out by purposeful malevolent government action sufficient for you?</p>

        <p>Laws, created by governments exist to make the citizen live "in harmony" (most of governments are based on populace revolutions by the way), could you tell me what human rights, democratic governments infringes ? And every government needs to be at least a tiny bit authoritarian, because obviously, if it was completely libertarian, government isn't necessary</p>

        <p>At what point does it become irrelevant history to you? In the sixties it was MK-ultra, and false flags to start Vietnam. 80's, the gov caused the crack epidemic. 90's and early 00's saw the opioid epidemic started by government subsidized companies (such as Pfizer). The Patriot Act was signed after the attacks on 9/11, which also helped Donald Rumsfeld hide unknown trillions of dollars which "went missing" from the very office in the Pentagon which was hit by a "plane" that none of the hundreds of security cams in the area actually managed to see. </p>
<p>03 saw an illegal war executed mostly on the civilians of Iraq and Afghanistan, which was started on a lie, and conveniently managed to secure the opium fields which may or may not have affected the opiate epidemic. </p>
<p>Since then, we've had our liberties and rights systematically dismantled by the very governments you choose to turn a blind eye to. </p>
<p>That's fine. I'm sure boots taste great. However, the sooner you realize that there is no separation of historical events to present events, the better off we will all be. </p>
<p>What makes no sense to me is that you think without some kinda external force acting on a corrupt government, they somehow magically became  uncorrupted. </p>
<p>That's magical thinking; the kind children exceed at. You have the mind of a child, and it shows by how willing you are to submit to daddy gov. Pathetic.</p>

        <p>Impossible?  No.  Unlikely?  Absolutely. </p>
<p>Government is an entity, just like any individual,  organization,  corporation,  etc.  Entities do what is best... for the entity.  If that happens to align with others, great, but it's not required. </p>
<p>Government,  at best, should be considered to be a necessary evil, and constrained as much as possible.  Let it get out of hand and you start seeing more of the "best for them" behavior.</p>

        <p>LOL. Apart from my being from Africa, the condition for independence for the Western and Central countries was a) they should always have France decide on their security matters and b) they should move their reserves to France and have the French Treasury hold their reserves as a backstop for the West African and Central African francs. That's not independence. Like I said, read more about your history.</p>

        <p>Not impossible, but on the whole, entirely unlikely. The reason your mechanic doesn’t teach you how to fix your car, is because he’d no longer be making a profit on your ignorance. Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts, absolutely. Sam Giancana said it best in the book, Doublecross, (paraphrased) ‘If any politician starts to fight for the little guy, we just whack em.’ The Do-good-ers are almost always squeezed out by the big faceless machine. If my gubmint states anything, and I mean ANYTHING, it’s almost certainly propaganda to cover something unseen. Whatever that said happened, it probably happened some other way. If the product is free-you are the product.</p>

        <p>Lying and obfuscation are two different birds. One is directly misleading you, while the other just lends you to your own mistruths. It’s a far subtler tactic. But, on the whole, yes. The govt has no interest in you being informed about things only they are informed about. It’s the modern day mystery cult. “Intelligence experts agree.....”</p>

        <p>Lol how old are you and have you made it to a middle school level history class yet? Governments throughout world history have always wanted more power which eventually leads to subjugation and death. The better question is why do you blindly trust people who don't care about you whatsoever? Do you think your government cares about you and your health? Do you think the pharmaceutical industry cares about you and your health? Have you heard the richest or most influential people in the world such as Gates and Prince William <em>literally</em> talk about wanted to depopulate the Earth through viruses and vaccines?</p>
<p>Edit: Stuff like The Great Reset from the WEF and Agenda 21 are not conspiracy theories, they're conspiracy facts. The most powerful people in the world are conspiring to make the world an impoverished slave colony and they're not even hiding it because they know useful idiots like you won't read their publicly available documents because you have your wine and circuses.</p>

For me, pharmaceutical industry don't care <strong>directly</strong> about your health, but they still care about it a little bit, you see, if their meds didn't work, and "alert launchers" (sorry I don't know how to translate it) would alert the world that meds don't work and no one would but them</p>
<p>And I don't know gates of your Prince William</p>

        <p>I’m against government overstepping their bounds and the implementation of broad restrictions with little nuance. Why should healthy people have to stop working? Why do kids need a covid vaccine? Why can Walmart stay open but the local hardware store can’t? Why is the Australian military enforcing lockdowns over 9 covid deaths? </p>
<p>I like my government small and to stay out of my private life as much as possible. Unfortunately, a lot of people are so scared of a virus that they’re willing to trade their privacy for a sense of safety. </p>
<p>Let me make my own risk assessment and make my own decisions. I don’t need my hand held by anyone.</p>

        <p>I'll illustrate my point of view : healthy people needs to be vaccinated, because it's not because you're healthy that you can't be sick (of covid, or anything else), kids need covid vaccine, because they can completely propagate the virus. Walmart is a necessary store like we say in France if Walmarts and other shops like it would close, people couldn't have any food, and hardware stores aren't necessary speed (like we say in France), you don't need them, they're only "comfort stores". And I'm not an expert in it, but I think that Australian government enforces a lockdown, because it is useful, just look at it, no studies found that covid is less likely to contaminate and propagate in the Australian "climate"</p>
<p>Honestly, I'm not scared of the virus for myself as I'm 14, and it's not new that I trust government on many things <em>obviously not all things</em></p>
<p>But if it was only for your sake, I think that most governments wouldn't make the covid vaccine obligatory, but you are more likely to propagate it while unvaccinated, than vaccinated you know?</p>

        <p>&rt;healthy people needs to be vaccinated, because it's not because you're healthy that you can't be sick (</p>
<p>This virus is not dangerous to young healthy people and there are effective therapeutics. Natural immunity has shown to be stronger than vaccine induced immunity. </p>
<p>&rt;kids need covid vaccine, because they can completely propagate the virus</p>
<p>According to most studies, spread from children has been almost non-existent. Either way the vaccine doesn't prevent you from spreading it or even lower your viral load so this point is moot.</p>
<p>&rt;I'm not an expert in it, but I think that Australian government enforces a lockdown, because it is useful</p>
<p>You're definitely not an expert, nor have you done any research beyond the headlines from lying news agencies. Lockdowns don't work, and they haven't worked anywhere. The US states with the strictest lockdowns are the same states with the highest death rate, and states that didn't lock down are just fine.</p>
<p>&rt;I'm 14,</p>
<p>Ah fuck, so now your naivety makes sense and I've just wasted a few minutes trying to explain things to a brick wall.</p>
<p>&rt;but you are more likely to propagate it while unvaccinated, than vaccinated you know?</p>
<p>Stop spreading disinformation. US CDC claims vaccinated carry a similar viral load to the unvaccinated.</p>

        <p>You just said that lockdowns are effective yet in the same post advocated for Walmart to remain open. You realize that those two statements are at odds with each other, right?</p>
<p>If the government can mandate vaccines to prevent covid deaths, why then can’t they control what we eat and how many minutes of exercise we get each day? Being obese weakens ones immune system making one significantly more susceptible to covid. Are you ok with the government mandating a diet and exercise regimen? 78% of covid ICU beds were filled by obese people. Where do you draw the line? </p>
<p>I understand that you are 14 so you haven’t experienced many things in life. Keep asking questions and keep an open mind. I’m in the US and I think we tend to value freedom a bit more than some of our European counterparts.</p>

        <p>It’s not “the government is against us”….it’s the fact that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. The people in charge of the government are not loving people…they have self interests and the public is the means in which they fulfill there self interest…weather it be money, power, etc. Do you think these self interest are going to serve your best interest. No, only you know what’s best for you. Lots of people are leery by the motives of all this nonesense because you can’t question it, you get censored , alternative treatments are shunned, and there is no discourse allowed to search for the truth. I could go on and on, but I have to go about my day…maybe someone can pick up where I left off</p>

        <p>Which centuries of French history does your curriculum cover?</p>
<p>France should be primarily concerned with the affairs of the French, not the affairs of another EU member. Hearing the opinions of a Belgian MEP won't bring jobs and prosperity to France because Belgians will want to help their own people. </p>
<p>French industries are uncompetitive because you have adopted a common currency and common market laws that hinder creativity. France used to make many things domestically but it chose globalism over its people and has a high poverty rate and a fragmented society. </p>
<p>You didn't know and had to Google it, proving my point that you just regurgitate talking points like "The EU is good" without even knowing how it works and who leads it. </p>
<p>If you don't know anyone who was 20+ in the 1970s, you can simply read a history book. I learnt French as a 3rd language and your country has more history books than I possibly know what to do with. If you really want to be informed and make a comparison, pick up a book detailing the lifestyle and standards of the French in the 1970s.</p>

        <p>Idk if they created it. But they are useing it. Why do you think they give a shit about little shops? The biggest bussiness have thrived. The little guys can pound sand. The stock markets are up. Nothing bad happened to them. They were able to gain more control. Have people listen to them. We showed we are weak and will follow thier orders.</p>

        <p>We just want government small and to help defend our western countries if threatened. Let us shape our own destiny and future. If the government wants to work for us to achieve it properly and morally then we welcome it. If it wants to hinder us with bullshit laws, rules, fines segregation and so on then it's not us that needs a reset. It's them!</p>

        <p>The individuals who have ensconced themselves as career politicians have time and again proven themselves unworthy of any trust whatsoever.</p>
<p>It isn't just lying to our faces to win a vote, it's in their opaque way of doing things- writing huge thousands of pages in a single bill, selling it as one thing but burying things in the law that they know fully well we do not support.</p>
<p>The deceit include supposed "opposition" that will do internal polls to see who is vulnerable to being thrown out of office in order to afford them the right to vote against unpopular laws that all involved intend to pass.</p>
<p>They have lied from the get-go here.  They have strung us along with an ever-moving end game and shifting virus characteristics- which include symptomology matching the prevailing seasonal condition.  Delta's symptoms are easily mistaken for hay fever now.  Original CV-19 match the flu during last flu season.</p>
<p>They have shirked the constitutional constraints put in place to limit them and they are playing this for as long as people like you implicitly believe them and enjoin them in opposition to those of us with the temerity to question the moving target narrative- that has little relevance to virus transmission but is quite effective in making movement difficult.</p>

        <p>These governments know that mass vaccinations during a pandemic will devastate societies (look it up ---- preferably not through Google) but they're doing it anyway to gain control of the people.</p>
<p>Only the people in the high risk categories should be taking this 'vaccine.'</p>
<p>The definition of a vaccine is that it provides immunity. This is not a vaccine, it's more like a flu shot.  If it was actually providing immunity, a whole lot more people would be in line to take it.</p>
