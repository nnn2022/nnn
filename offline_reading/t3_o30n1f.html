    <strong>I actually jumped for joy when I heard about the vaccine roll out late last year.</strong>
    <p><p>I was so excited when they brought the vaccines out. In December 2020, they announced they would start giving them to the over 80s in our country and I thought, finally. A few months down the line and we'll be fine and back to normal.</p>
<p>My aunt who's 70 was offered the vaccine in February. I was excited to ring her and she was telling me all about her appointment. I remember saying, "you'll be tested for antibodies first, right? I mean you might already be immune and then you won't need the jab at all. They might save it for someone who needs it." She said no, nobody gets tested for antibodies.</p>
<p>This is where I started doubting this whole operation. Why are they jabbing people left right and centre when they estimate a good portion of us has already been exposed to the virus? Hence we have a good immune response to the virus? </p>
<p>I was contacted about my shot in May and they've sent me countless text messages, two letters and a phonecall. This is in England where the National Health Service is apparently overwhelmed and can't give out regular appointments to people who need them because they're understaffed. But they've got enough  time and resources to go out their way to push the vaccine. </p>
<p>I've heard about the USA and how they're offering incentives to people who are hesitant, and Canada where parents are stripped of their rights to protect their teenagers and kids as young as 12 are given the vaccine without needing consent from their parents. It's all just a bit dodgy to me.</p>
<p>It's June and currently 80% of the population in our country has had the first dose. Over half have had both doses. But we're not getting back to normal - far from it. We're actually getting worse. Restrictions are getting stricter. Summer events are cancelled for the second year in a row although we were promised this year they'd definitely go ahead. </p>
<p>I lost all my trust in the system. I'm not a conspiracy theorist - I've had all my other vaccines, my both children have had their childhood vaccines. But something doesn't seem right here at all. Btw I'm educated in health sciences, in fact I wrote a dissertation about the coronavirus in 2016 when the average Joe had not even heard the term.</p>
<p>I still think the vaccine is good for the elderly and vulnerable who are at higher risk of Covid complications but what's with trying to vaccinate the whole world? Including teenagers and how long until they decide that even children under 10 need to be vaccinated? This is dodgy as hell. Something's not right at all here.</p></p>

        <p>I agree with everything you said. There are so many red flags that have just solidified my stance about the vaccine. I'm never taking it no matter what. There's no way I'm risking my health for an experimental vaccine against a virus I virtually have no risk from. Also it ain't gonna protect others, because, firstly, the elderly and vulnerable have already received the vaccine and secondly, it doesn't prevent me from catching and spreading the virus.</p>

        <p>They're even recommending PREGNANT WOMEN to get this vaccine, with NO IDEA how that will effect the fetus. Im convinced they are trying to kill us, or the vaccine will do something to them that will influence the next steps of the New World Order.</p>

        <p>That blows my mind. When you’re pregnant there’s a laundry list innocuous things you’re told to be scared of/avoid. Hot baths and hot tubs. Deli meat. Runny eggs. Caffeine. Litter boxes. ANY medication even OTC without asking. No sleeping on your back or stomach. No flying after a certain point. They go for extreme safety measures during pregnancy. </p>
<p>A brand new vaccine would have to prove it was safer than the risk of COVID. I understand pregnant women are more susceptible to things like the flu and food poisoning, hence their recommendations for flu shot (known safety profile vs the flu) and well cooked and washed foods. </p>
<p>. But what stats did we see about COVID in pregnant women vs testing of the vaccine in pregnant women to make that cost/benefit analysis? By the time they were recommending it for pregnant women, they had a short term “study” of 100 women (pregnant OR breastfeeding) and many of them hadn’t even given birth yet.</p>

<p>"The sample included 30 pregnant women,16 women who were breastfeeding, and 57 women who were neither pregnant nor breastfeeding."</p>
<p>Most of them weren't even pregnant! What a joke.</p>

        <p>In Australia the government cautions against having the vaccine/at least weighing the possible impacts for pregnant women. Even the CDC acknowledges the lack of studying into it. Like come on. Two seconds of searching it up.</p>

        <p>Well, it does have to do with that but the stakeholders are the pharma companies testing products on unwilling test subjects.</p>
<p>They usually pay people to test drugs but instead they got a testers dream, the actual population.</p>
<p>I wonder how much money people are saving Pfizer etc.<br>
Actually the reality is that these products wouldn't have made it to the market anytime soon without the EUA.</p>

        <p>I agree 100%. I also have all my vaccines from childhood and my military service. The things you said were exactly my thought process with the vaccines. I figured they would roll them out to people 70 and older and then give the option to the 69 and under crowd as time went on and more doses became available. But as a degree holder in political science, I know too much about salami tactics and how they slowly slice away your freedoms until there’s no salami left to slice and everything that was before is now gone. They are literally re writing the rules of society before our eyes, even with the elderly and immune compromised fully vaccinated. People are still looking at me maskless in public like I’m Jesus on Nazareth carrying my cross to my place of crucifixion. The damage is done as far as society and rules go thanks to Covid. There will never be a day in the future that is similar policy and societal wise as pre March 2020. Things implemented from the start of the pandemic deemed “only for use during pandemic” are still around and will be for the rest of society.</p>

        <p>I've abandoned my career in science back in 2017 to have children. I must say I regret this sometimes. They're lovely - they're my whole world. But I look around and think, what kind of a world did I bring them into? My toddler doesn't remember the world before masks. He was playing pretend shop the other day and said to me, you can't come in without a mask. My youngest was born in December 2019 just before it all kicked off. I'm very worried.</p>

        <p>I think most of them are good people and genuinely believe they're doing the right thing. But I do struggle to understand. How does someone look around and think, oh yeah, jabbing teenagers, masking toddlers - this is perfectly fine. The mind boggles.</p>

        <p>Humans are highly programmable and have a huge need to conform, to belong in a group. I think this must be an evolutionary trait,  where survival as an individual was unlikely and the protection of a clan was needed. Of course there's always outliers and there are degrees, but it's fair to say that's the general idea. </p>
<p>Unfortunately this can be exploited so easily.</p>

        <p>I know you said you're not a conspiracy theorist, but I do recommend giving r/conspiracy a look. Conspiracy Theorists get a bad rep from the media (who are responsible for pushing the v*xx) They get called Bigfoot hunters, UFO hunters, all that jazz. They pull a jacked-up homeless man off the street, offer him a decent payment, and have him talk about getting probed in the ass for a minute. Boom, instant propaganda. The next step is to call anyone who thinks critically a Conspiracy nut, on par with the crazy man they featured on TV.</p>
<p>r/conspiracy does have it's oddballs, but it is also a place of free thought and critical thinking. It may seem crazy, but it's a place where you can throw an idea at the wall, and a few others will respond with their own research in the comments. We saw all this coming before NoNewNormal was a thing. We predicted the New Normal years in advance.</p>
<p>By posting on this subreddit, you are automatically a Conspiracy Theorist, because the meaning of the term has changed. Anyone who thinks critically, anyone who questions the governments around the world, they are just Conspiracy Theorists.</p>
<p>Think for yourself, and think about giving us Nut Jobs a chance. You may find that, in a world of insanity, the only sane ones are labeled crackpots and fools.</p>
<p>Best of luck either way my dude.</p>

        <p>Heh, you are kinda lucky to be seeing this now. I’ve had a while to dwell on it, and it’s honestly just depressing. I feel useless, unable to affect or change the direction the world is going in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>Some of the most popular posts and reposts on r/conspiracy are about the Clintons murdering anyone who has dirt on them, or Gary Webb, who was murdered by the CIA because he was gonna blow the whistle on their drug trafficking from Mexico. Posts like these just tell you that, no matter what you do, trying to stop this will net you a suicide with two bullets in the back of your head.</p>

        <p>Somethings not right 100000%</p>
<p>I live in Canada and the whole 12 year old no consent thing fucking blew my mind.</p>
<p>Experts saying that  12 year olds are mature enough to make informed consent as it relates to their health....i couldn't make this shit up if i tried. Amazingly stupid....how about a tattoo while ur at it!</p>
<p>An acquaintance took her 3 teenagers to get the jab.
None of them wanted it. However all were "forced to take it.....apparently the consent only goes one way...they weren't able to opt out whem mamma said take it. And to boot they were bribed with a puppy! </p>
<p>Insane insane insane. 1 in 1 million chance that covid will kill this age group.  Twice as likley to get  hit by lightning...i kid u not!  Yet if you actually asked this age group about the risk of covid they would tell u that they would likley die and for sure kill grandma. The fear factor instilled in the kids is beyond crazy.
They DO NOT have the capacity to think critically.</p>
<p>So sad, so so sad, the world have gone mad :(</p>

        <p>I was eager to get the vaccine back in I believe January or February, but they were rolling it out by age group in my state so I had to wait. During that time I had a lot of time to research how these new vaccines worked, and at first I was fascinated and excited by the mRNA technology, but then I started reading about animal trials and things took a turn for the worse. I started getting concerned about using our own cells to manufacture spike proteins; which sounds like a bad idea. I then started hearing about all the side effects and sudden deaths. I decided to wait, and during that time the mainstream media started putting out weird articles about vaccine envy and people feeling superior based on which brand of vaccine they got and that really got me skeptical. There was also the J&amp;J getting recalled for blood clots. After vaccinations started slowing down and the media started going full blast on vaccine pressure is when red flags REALLY started going up. Then there's all the censorship, misinformation and the World Economic Forum pretty much gloating about how employers are going to force you to get it, and governments tying vaccination status to regaining freedoms.</p>

        <p>Yeah, exactly. Once they've started talking about the vaccine passport which was dismissed as a wild conspiracy theory back then is now a reality. That's when I really woke up.</p>
<p>I have studied the structure of the coronavirus and how it enters the cells a few years ago and tbh having our cells express the spike protein to trigger an immune reaction seemed originally a good idea to me. It's just what the excessive amount of these proteins can cause in our body - I think this part was underestimated.</p>

        <p>Well good thing I started a business. I can say fuck you to anybody but the customers &amp; it wouldn't hurt my bottom line. Can't fire me if I'm my own man. </p>
<p>Ironically my business model is about throwing kids parties. Which could not happen for a year. Oh the explaining I'll have to do when I tell parents I'm not vaxxed &amp; I have zero plans to be. I can smell the shitstorm.</p>

        <p>Well done for figuring this out and trusting your instinct. So many people have blind faith and trust in the system.</p>
<p>There are just so many lies, Boris, Handcock and his team are expert trained liars.</p>
<p>It's a shocking state of affairs but the reality is that this process is all about control, a power grab from the top which has no respect for individuals or nation states. This is just the start...</p>

        <p>I’m similar to you. I read the first phizer paper as soon as it was released, was really let down because there was obvious signs of data manipulation (I’m a data scientist so pretty good at spotting it), and literally all the negative results (no matter how small) were not elaborated on at all in the paper. In general, the data disaster I am seeing has made me very reluctant to comply with much of anything.</p>
<p>While I do not believe any of this shit is truly planned, I do believe we are basically killing ourselves with technology, and worry for the future.</p>

        <p>Same, because I thought it would just be a normal vaccine using either heat inactivated viral particles or a certain amount of spike protein expressed using bacterial or insect  vectors etc. </p>
