    <strong>How fucked do you think we are?</strong>
    <p><p>Looking to hear your thoughts regarding the vaccine and if/when you think shit will hit the fan? </p>
<p>I’m from Ontario and I think we are going to have a somewhat normal summer but come fall, I think vaccinated people are going to start getting very sick... if Society was going to collapse over this, do you think we would start to see it in the fall or do you think it will take longer then this? </p>
<p>Is anyone else preparing for the worst? Everything that is going on just feels so wrong and evil yet everyone around me thinks we are home free because they’ve been  vaccinated. </p>
<p>Personally I plan to spend most of my summer stocking up on as much food and supplies as I can... am I losing my mind??</p></p>

        <p>&rt; if Society was going to collapse over this, do you think we would start to see it in the fall or do you think it will take longer then this? </p>
<p>I honestly thought the "vaccine" was just going to be saline solution, cause they didn't really care about actually injecting shit into people, they just wanted to be able to ask for papers anytime for whatever reason and exclude unwanteds from society as they pleased.</p>
<p>Well, the more you look into it, the more it seems like it's not the case. No matter how hard they try to censor it or to misdirect ("the vaccine wasn't the cause" and all that garbage) there's plently people that died or had bad reactions to it. Meaning <em>something</em> is in it.</p>
<p>This is a virus that overwhelmingly kills the old and the sick. There is <em>zero</em> reason behind vaccinating everyone, including 12 years old. Zero. No matter how you look at it. Even if it's so "the variants do not evade the vaccine" it makes absolutely zero sense, as you will always have people that can't be vaccinated, and the virus has animal reservoirs - meaning it can freely replicate in animals and then reinfect people a la swine flu. Plus, it's not even clear if the "vaccine" stops virus replication or just stifle symptoms.</p>
<p>The above is something <em>they</em> say, it's their data, it's their narrative. So <em>WHY</em> vaccinate everyone? I'm asking it from their own narrative's point of view. It makes zero sense. Even if this was a deadly virus that needed immediate emergency intervention (it was not), by looking at their own data this is <em>over</em> the second all 60 years old are vaccinated. Again, according to their own data, 95%+ of the deaths and more than 80% of the hospitalization happen in the +60 age range. There is <em>zero</em> chance 59 years old and younger overwhelm an hospital system because of covid. They can't not know, cause <em>it's their data</em>. So <em>why</em> force an experimental untested gene teraphy program onto a young and healthy population by using world destroying measures like basically jailing everyone for 1+ years so the moment a way out is available everyone will rush towards it? Because as far as it looks like to me this whole ordeal was just a huge advertising campaign for this "vaccine" or whatever it is they want everyone injected with.</p>
<p>So to go back to what's gonna happen to the vaccinated and when: who knows? Nothing good, that's for sure. But as far my understanding of the matter goes, it can take many years or a completely different virus to trigger ADE and send their immune system to the cleaners. It can be very well after this fall. Really, we don't get to know cause we don't know what's in it.</p>
<p>&rt; Is anyone else preparing for the worst? Everything that is going on just feels so wrong and evil yet everyone around me thinks we are home free because they’ve been vaccinated. </p>
<p>I have been preparing for the worst my whole life but this just goes above and beyond something one single person can prepare for. We're fucked and there's nothing we can do about it. You can stock as much as you want but without a functioning society out there, or one that actively wants you dead, there's absolutely nothing you can do.</p>
<p>My prediction is that they will create another wave using PCR testing at a huge amount of cycles again, and blame that wave somehow on the unvaccinated. How? I have no idea, but people have been drinking from the government's koolaid hose for a year and some and I see no sign of that changing anytime soon, so they can make up literally what they want and people will buy it - cause if nothing of the current narrative makes any sense anyway, and they still buy it... why would future narrative need to make sense then?</p>
<p>Once they manage to turn the unthinking masses against us who are not taking the vaccine, not being vaccinated will turn from "mild annoyance" to "your life is fucking over" - we will not be able to go anywhere, maybe not even shopping for essentials, and people will actively seek us out. In Europe, where constitutional protections are sidesteppable at the very least and people are not armed like in the US, government will just create laws that will make life during the third reich feel like a libertarian paradise for the unvaccinated.</p>
<p>And even if I'm wrong about all this (I really, really hope that's the case) the very concept of freedom is dead. We now live in a world without freedom. Government has done this once, they know they can do it again - and they will. We will have to live the rest of our lives waking up and checking if the government has decided to put us all into house arrest again.</p>

        <p>If vaccinated people start getting sick or dying I have no sympathy whatsoever. It blows my mind that so many people have been dumb enough to shove a rushed, experimental needle in their arm to "protect" them from something that has a 99% survival rate.</p>

        <p>My thoughts exactly. I begged my parents and my brothers not to get it. I presented hours worth of arguments and made a solid case and it went in one ear and out the other. Slowly one by one they each went and got the jab. As more and more of them started getting it I started getting more desperate and even tried bribing my last brother with 5k to at least just wait 6 months before deciding to get it. He laughed in my face and went and got it anyways... he’s broke and has so much debt in student loans I didn’t think there was a chance in hell he’d turn down my offer... I don’t understand the decisions people are making right now. None of this makes sense</p>

        <p>I've been trying to explain to my mom for a year that vaccines take years to perfect and this one is rushed. But it's like talking to a wall, she doesn't do her own research and always shuts me down, even calling me a lunatic who needs to "see a doctor" ffs. So of course she inevitably went through with it. It's her choice obviously and I hope she'll be ok, but if there are any consequences of it, it's her fault and I've told her that.</p>

We need to be careful because if the vaxxed start dropping like flies in a few months/years or develop infertility it will be much easier to locate the people that haven't taken it, and we will absolutely be targeted and scapegoated.</p>

        <p>In my honest opinion this is how I believe it will go down in ontario....During the start of winter  (flu season) cases of "covid" will begin to spike and we will end up staying in lockdown for the rest of 2021-2022 They will blame the vaccines not working on "Variants" along with blaming the unvaccinated for the rise in cases; I honestly believe covid will not end for another 5 years....when the great reset is fully implemented Then covid will no longer be needed</p>

        <p>I don’t even know where to begin. I have no survival skills whatsoever and have no idea how to prepare for whatever might be coming, but I’ve thought about this a lot. Personally I don’t know if things will really go down, but I think sometime this fall/winter I’ll be buying loads of canned items. Just in case.

        <p>Buy bulk 25 lbs bags of rice and beans. Store them in mylar bags with oxygen absorbers. Buy a berkey water filter. Buy some cheap rain barrels to store and collect water. Find some cheap protein that has a long shelf life. You can prepare for anything for a few hundred bucks if you do it now.</p>
<p>After you take care of the basics, consider planting a garden. Potatoes are hard to beat for calories and are super easy to grow.</p>

        <p>That’s solid advice.  One thing the wife and I have done is collect all the books you can find on preserving any type of food.  Don’t rely on the internet. We keep enough dry goods and canned to survive a couple of months on hand. We also have an 800 sq ft cabin with a well and a gardening spot in the boonies.</p>

        <p>Smarter to buy them now than then. Shortages can sneak up quickly. As long as you stock up on things you’d normally eat then you’ll be fine. You just never want to wait to start preparing for something once it has started.</p>
<p>As far as survival skills, there are plenty of YouTube and subreddits about that. I’d suggest learning how to grow food and fix/build stuff.</p>

        <p>IMO. There isn’t going to be a massive die off of vaccinated people. There may be a media turn around regarding shedding and protein spike damage; similar to the lab leak information. The power the government has been given in regards to lockdowns and taking away our freedoms with little to no justification will continue.</p>

        <p>The collapse will likely start over summer. Personally I don't think there will be a "normal" summer followed by more lockdowns. Lockdowns will begin to ease over the summer but then come the cyberattacks - first with long power outages then other infratructure, followed by internet lockdowns and food shortages. This will utterly demolish what is left of the economy and usher in martial law with your rations very likely dependant on your vaccinated status.</p>
<p>Stock up on food &amp; water for the short-term, but I'm not too hopeful about the long-term. Even if you were able to disappear into the wilderness and survive off-grid, future projects they've lined up include blanketing the entire earth in real-time spy satellites and blocking out the sun (these aren't conspiracy theories btw, you can find them online, shockingly all funded by Bill Gates).</p>

        <p>It is kind of weird, actually. I was raised Christian but am no longer. I think all "myths" and "legends" have a grain of truth to them, misconstrued across many thousands of years into something difficult to recognize plainly.</p>
<p>But I do find it strange some of the events in Revelation vs today. My theory is that history repeats itself time and time again because we do not heed the stories passed down. And that maybe something similar happened ages ago in some lost civilization we haven't found yet.</p>

        <p>Brother man, there isn’t anyone in this planet who cites the Bible as a historical text. That’s because it isn’t. If there were people walking out of their graves or walking on water someone would have noticed. Only the other writers of the gospels back each other’s story up and even then only half assed. Listen if you believe that stuff and think it’s a handbook for what we’re currently going through. Good luck to you, be well.</p>

        <p>Bro do you not realize how many people witnessed the things you just mentioned. That’s the reason why some of the early followers came to Christ. And you didn’t even answer my simple question. Maybe you should reconsider your stance. I don’t want to see people with good intentions like you perish. Please just give it a chance before it’s to late. Who else do you think is running this sick world, it’s Satan, the fallen angels, demons, and the elites. I see on your post below this that you were raised Catholic. I can understand why you would shy away from the faith after being in that religious cult. Jesus said pick up your cross and follow Me. Not some religion or some pope.</p>

        <p>All due respect. Whatever religion it is you follow, it’s just another cult. I’m not going to sit by and pray=hope/wish that bad things don’t happen. I take things into my own hands and deal with the tangible things before me. Best wishes to you.</p>

        <p>I think that the possibility exists that these vaccines will cause real problems that they will then blame on neW sTrAinS which they will use to justify more fascists policies like mandating vaccines possibly.</p>
<p>Theoretically you would think it could be a clear cut case easy to define because there'd be a line drawn between those who took the government insemination and those who didn't.  However, with increasing evidence that these vaccines "spread" to unvaccinated individuals Im not sure that'll be the case and I actually worry about even myself now where I didn't worry before.</p>

Make sure your money is in REAL VALUE (i.e. house, tools, gold/silver, livestock). Avoid 401ks, crypto and things like that where your money is invisible. Make it tangible.</p>

        <p>Yeah dude you’re tripping. There wont be any kind of covid rapture / societal collapse, it just that the pandemic was pretty disruptive of our habits and for some people it exacerbes mental problems like paranoïd delusion and what not. 
You just really need to understand that it’s not the end of the world and that toxic sub reddits like this fucking echo chamber of utter brain damaged conspirationists will do no good but get you deeper into your negative ideologies.</p>
<p>Please seek help my man I’m genuinely concerned about your mental well being !</p>
