    <strong>One family getting sick is enough to delay an entire election in a country...think about that.</strong>
    <p><p>New Zealand was apparently free of cases for 121 days and then when suddenly a family gets the coco out of nowhere, not only do they go back to a completely strict lockdown but are delaying an election because of it. Over. One. Family. The cases are just an excuse for political bodies to ignore all laws and rights. This is no longer about our well-being and clearly has not been for a long time. Meanwhile touting it as "in their best interest". Funny this is happening during multiple elections. </p>

        <p>The men is New Zealand/Australia got neutered by the politicians. Everyone is cowering in fear of the tyrants in their basements... If you can't they cant stand up for themselves and boot the current government out, then it's their faults for accepting it.</p>
<p>They have crossed the lines in those two countries, it's literally fema camps and absolute tyranny ruling their lives now... From democracy to USSR socialism era within months.</p>

        <p>Wearing a mask is safe. Wearing a mask slows the spread of COVID-19. It does not stop it. You can still spread COVID-19 if most people wear a mask. I have no clue what factors went into delaying the election. But your comment made no sense in this context.</p>

        <p>If masks really worked, we would all be starting school and going back to the office now. Oh whew. We figured it out. Masks...lets go.</p>
<p>Instead. They are being required, but politicians are still acting like they don't do shit to make policy decisons.... schools closed,  churches closed....</p>

        <p>Thanks for asking. First of all, masks do not cure COVID-19. Helps slow the spread is all. Not masks alone either. Proper social distancing and sterilization is important too. Sadly, too many in this country believe this virus isn't that big of a deal and it's being blown out of proportion. There are actually communities dedicated to convincing people it is somehow worse to wear a mask than it is to catch the virus. Or just saying it's outright fake! Crazy, I know. But that's the times we live in. </p>
<p>If only there weren't so many of these morons spreading misinformation maybe we would be in a better position than 160,000+ dead and climbing. It's insane to me that someone would be so selfish and narrow minded to think they are right while the world's top experts are wrong. I truly believe these ani-maskers or nonewnormies of whatever you call yourselves should be charged with attempted murder for trying to spread such dangerous misinformation. Wear a mask and quit being a bunch of babies.</p>

        <p>Re: "interested in learning anything".  So <em>you're</em> going to be the great savior that teaches us?  Have you perhaps considered that we read the same sources, we've heard it all before, and we've come to different conclusions than you have?  And that "debating" you will result in nothing productive, you'll simply just ignore any of the statistics and sources we provide (to be fair, we'll ignore the shit you sling at us because we've likely already encountered it).  </p>
<p>Re: the downvotes and echo chambers.  I note that your comment is still up and you haven't been banned.  If any of us were to enter <em>your</em> echo chambers our comments would be deleted and we'd quickly be banned.</p>
<p>I think that explains why you're being ignored.  Thanks for visiting though.</p>

        <p>So... I was responding to someone saying they wanted to hear from "those jerks" like me and I said ask me anything. Saying you'd like to hear from someone usually means you want to learn how their perspective changed or why they still believe what they do. Turns out this sub does not want any perspective that disagrees with their own. Check out the Dunning-Kruger effect if you truly want to learn something and you'll see what's happening in this sub.</p>

        <p>Are you saying I suffer from it? What have I said that is wrong? I offered to answer questions if anyone truly cared for my perspective. I was met with downvotes and people telling me they don't want my perspective. I came here to see what people who disagree with me are saying. Had I found some actual information or anything maybe I would change my perspective. I have consumed a number of links on this sub and each one contained a very close minded perspective or just blatant misinformation that is easily disproved. I also found people that will defend that misinformation to the death and will ban/downvote anyone that disagrees. Textbook d-k society.</p>

        <p>140 preventable deaths is ok to you? I wonder how the families of those 140 people feel. And it's not over. Just wait for the next few hundred or thousand deaths. And I don't want to hear any complaints from you when you slowly choke to death on fluids in your lungs.</p>

        <p>"12k confirmed cases and 140 deaths in a metro area with 1 million people." You say that so proudly when in reality those figures are just absolutely terrible. New Zealand with a population of 4 million people has only 1.6k confirmed cases and only 22 DEATHS. Can you calculate proportion my friend? You can't? I wonder what would the death count be like for New Zealand if we followed your  "strategy".  🤔 I'll let you figure that out for yourself. 👍</p>

        <p>You're right about that, but it's still worth noting that I don't see why they think there's any guarantee the situation will be better four weeks after the date than it will be on that date. There's also the fact that people can vote remotely or in a physically distanced and sanitized fashion anyway, so there's no real reason to delay any elections over this.</p>

        <p>Assuming it's the super contagious strain and not the early Asian one, they're going to get a lot more cases so it'll be interesting to see what happens as they get towards their new election.
