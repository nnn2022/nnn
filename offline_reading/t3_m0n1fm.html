    <strong>Moving to a No New Normal friendly country?</strong>
    <p><p>So I have something of a digital nomad lifestyle, and I'm concerned that I risk getting stuck when they start requiring Covid passports to travel. I got stuck in Taiwan, which was the best scenario, but I'll have to move on at some point and find a new place to settle down.</p>
<p>So my plan is to pick a country that will be safe long term, and just stay there for a few years, by which time I expect all this pandemic and vaccine bs to have become old news. I suspect I'm already immune, so I'm not really concerned about the pandemic itself.</p>
<p>That raises two concerns: at which point will countries start to demand foreigners to be vaccinated before arrival, and at what point will they force those in the country to get vaccinated? There might be a window now where you might be able to enter a country before they start asking for vaccine passports, I don't mind quarantine if that's the worst of it. I'm partial to South East Asia, so I'll discuss that area.</p>
<p>I can actually Singapore at this time (visa exemption even) with just an overnight quarantine, which sounds good. Covid numbers are really low and they seem to have healthy policies in place that ensure future containment. The problem is that the government is a tad authoritarian, and they've started vaccinating, so I'm not sure if they'll start to require it from foreigners entering, and those already present.</p>
<p>Thailand is similar to Singapore, with low numbers. Vaccinations are slow, and because of recent protests I doubt the government would try to force vaccinations. The other day an official said foreigners would have to get tested every time they ask for a visa extension but this was quickly "corrected" as being wrong information, probably after too much outcry. They also offer a lot of visa options, so that might be an option. There's talk of allowing tourists from July, but that's probably focused on the vaccinated. It does have the edge of size over Singapore, lots of places to visit if you're stuck for a long time.</p>
<p>Indonesia, high covid numbers, but Bali is said to become a Green Zone in itself. I'm guessing they'll require vaccinations, but once there I don't think they'll enforce it.</p>
<p>Malaysia, high covid numbers but life seems to be getting back to normal. Very authoritarian and dysfunctional government, so I think it's quite likely they'll try to force the vaccine for entry and on locals, they've already hinted at this on several occasions. But the number of people signing up for the vaccine seems low, so there might not be enough public support. Maybe living under a corrupt government makes people naturally suspicious.</p>
<p>If people have insight on how it might be in other countries, do share.</p></p>
