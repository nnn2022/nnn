        <p>After my wife developed eczema following a shot, we started actually reading product inserts.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The known risks are terrifying. The amount of unknowns admitted to because they have not been studied are terrifying. The post-market adverse reactions listed because of seriousness or frequency are terrifying. The ingredients are disgusting. Quite a few have human fetal cells, DNA, and proteins as excipients.</p>
<p>Then you find out the manufacturers are exempt from any liability! Then you find out about VAERS and all that. Then you find out about vaccines that have had to be recalled because of the damage they caused. Then you wonder why no one knows any of this.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I teach a girl that went into cardiac arrest as an infant because of DTaP, and now she is special needs and will never live a normal life. It's amazing how many people you can find with vaccine injuries when you actually start to look and broach the subject with people.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And it tops it all off to realize that vaccines are completely unnecessary. There is no substitute for cleanliness and sanitation within a society, and for good nutrition with quality ingredients, good diet, and exercise. Where vaccines are credited with eradicating the likes of polio, etc., those diseases had already decreased in prevalence 99% because of modernity (see Jayne Donegan's report that stood up in British Court of Law againt the British General Medical Council...she argues that vaccines are not necessary and WON...here's the link to her report. It costs a little bit of money but is highly worth it: <a href="http://www.jayne-donegan.co.uk/childhood-vaccinatable-diseases-and-their-vaccines/">http://www.jayne-donegan.co.uk/childhood-vaccinatable-diseases-and-their-vaccines/</a>)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Anyways, given COVID, we're all experts now on fake news and manipulative media in a polygamous relationship with the medical community and politicians. I am so happy that people are starting to put it together that this didn't just start now.</p>

        <p>Smoke, mirrors, and paid-for public officials can go a long way.  Look at statins, low fat, glyophosate, for example.  Just now realizing those things were dangerous and based on bullshit science.  Lasted for almost a century and still refusing to die.  Humans are monkeys.</p>

        <p>It’s hard to think critically or outside the box right? You’ve never associated the 600 000 thousand deaths to a glaring reality that in the US, and for that matter, all of western culture, we have a massive obesity problem… so much so, that it kills more than starvation right now… what’s even more insidious… is that it is promoted and normalized in a corportocracy led existence… lol it’s nice to think Russians or North Koreans are brainwashed by the state but theres no way a westerner can’t be… lol… a “western altruist” should be an oxymoron at this point… </p>
<p>You just keep cradling yourself thinking the most enlightened pharmeceutical scientists or the pinnacle of intellectualism in the realm of genetics cant sometimes overlook things or worse get something wrong… is it too scary to admit that the <em>slightest</em> variable or nuance could’ve been overlooked even with the best intentions… or you just piously believe in their abilities… like there’s no way we as a species tend to collectively have our heads so far up our asses to think we can control nature or an <em>endemic</em> virus at this point with a manmade medical technology… </p>
<p>Or if you want to scoff off the very real potential for antibody dependant enhancement and the implications thereof… that’s cool too… </p>
<p>If you want to deny the reality… and fauci’s recent statements suggesting the viral load in vaxxed and unvaxxed recipients who catch covid is exactly the same… it’s only that the vaxxed have less severe symptoms… so even if you segregated all the vaxxed from unvaxxed… ya know “medical apartheid” something you brown shirts really want right now, the virus will continue to mutate in the vaccinated and unvaccinated alike… since it’s endemic now… </p>
<p>You don’t want to consider the law of declining virulence… you don’t want to consider that dwindling hospitalizations attributed to vaccine success which we can admit they are… could also be attributed to natural immunity and or a combination of the two… </p>
<p>You don’t want to think that doctors and specialists that have raised “concern” and “speculate” that some downsides to mass vaccination could have some potential adverse and unforeseen consequences… even when they admit to there “concerns” and admit it’s “speculation” they’re still labelled quacks, censored or silenced… even though this very notion of contrarian thought in debate and discussion is a <em>pillar</em> of the scientific method!! </p>
<p>If you don’t think it’s strange that the vaccine campaign and resources attributed to all its marketing and advertising could’ve “equally” been met with just as much of an emphasis on empowering people with healthy lifestyles EI eating 10 servings of fruit and veggies a day… daily exercise… balanced diets… and an aversion to processed foods and too much meats and the profound impacts a healthy lifestyle has on increasing youre chances from avoiding hospitalization from covid… and basically every other known disease and sickness associated with poor lifestyle and nutrition… maybe people would be more trusting of big pharma and govt… but no it seemed that way of thinking is a little bit to opposing to corporate ideals… </p>
<p>if you’re at risk, extremely unhealthy, and want to continue smoking or eating fast food everyday for lunch… and don’t want to exercise or improve your overall personal life then by all means take the vaccine… and you’re right people can still take precautions… social distance… wear masks… not walk into old age homes with pre licked popcycles to hand out… </p>
<p>I’m wondering have you seen the protests happening right now in Europe like France, Italy and the UK? You don’t find it worrisome that it’s not reported by mainstream media? That news on issues and events like that should be <em>objective</em> regardless of your covid outlook… because it happens to be a “truth” that is going on in the world… you don’t find that censorship strange?? </p>
<p>Even as new data surfaces daily… all I ask… is to explore other narratives or information maybe it’s a mix of truth from everything… broaden your horizons… I read the exact same mainstream narrative… the established doctrines put out by doctors and scientists on msm, r/coronavirus, CNN, that you do… more so I try to be conscious that’s it’s all propaganda FOX is, the NNN is, every goddamn media platform is… but which ones are completely non partisan? Independant? I don’t know…. Maybe a transparent debate would help? Otherwise… I know I could be wrong… led astray… cognitive dissonant… dunning Kruger afflicted hypocrit… do you ever question yourself? Or the experts? You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to do so… which leads us to the other problem that we tend to look down on uneducated people.. demean them… to a point where the narrative right now suggests that they don’t even deserve a voice… it’s fucked up</p>
<p>… and I guess you’d like to join the ranks of the thought police I guess?</p>
