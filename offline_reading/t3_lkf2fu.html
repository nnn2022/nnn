    <strong>I tried posting in r/parenting and got permanently banned.</strong>
    <p><p>I tried to reach out to other parents and hopefully find some good places to consider relocating to where my daughter could have a normal life. Of course, I faced a bunch of opposition about wanting her to grow up mask-free and so I started arguing. Now I'm permanently banned from asking for parenting advice. </p>
<p>Do we need to make an anti-mask anti-lockdown parents forum?</p></p>

        <p>same here.  its going well opting out, and cant stand the idea of all day masking.  ours is still young elementary, i really feel for the 16-24 age group the most.  and just to be harsh, because i am fucking pissed off, i feel for the obese diabetic older demo the least now because as sad as it is, they were already in morbid condition before 2020 and now are being used as a political football to create a god damned shitty extended dystopian reality 99% of innocent and not at risk people have to live in daily and pay the price for.</p>

        <p>For sure. I feel for my 14yo because he misses his friends, but he knows that he likely wouldn't be allowed to hang with them at school anyway. </p>
<p>My 8yo has breathing difficulties as it is and was scheduled for a turbinate reduction, but doesn't want the surgery until his dad and I can actually go to the hospital with him. The whole situation is ridiculous and truly angers me for all these kids who's lives are the ones suffering because of a damn cold that kills old people....just like what happens EVERY YEAR since the beginning of time.</p>

        <p>I think the 30 year old bodybuilder and 20 year old ballerina who both had to be on ventilators for a month and the 20 year old still died would care to disagree with you that this is a 'damned cold that kills old people'.</p>
<p>CoVid-19 or more SARS-CoV-2 is a CHAOTIC disease. That is what makes it so terrifying to the majority of the populace. It literally can pass over a 200 pound overweight 50 year old person and give them just the sniffles while in a person of 'right' weight who is 20 years old gets severely sickened to the point of near-death or actual death.</p>

        <p>Yes, let's blame the "obese diabetic older demo", and not the government that imposed these restrictions. Best that we point fingers at each other, and not at the elites behind this farce. Great job.</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for the downvotes, too, sub. Thanks. Just goes to show you're all a bunch of assholes who want to just find any excuse to bully people you hate. So sure, continue going after the "undesirables" while the government laughs at your stupidity.</p>
<p>Edit2: Now I'm being upvoted out of nowhere. I guess because it's more "fun" for people to upvote someone who says they got downvoted, to make them look "crazy", right?</p>

        <p>thats a fair point, i am just tired of the moralism and hysteria over people who, lets face it, aren’t looking to make it to 90.  its always sad when a life ends to a degree - whether modern society over tragedizes death is another topic almost - but those covid deaths, which are around a 10th of total deaths in america at least, have been used to get well meaning kind hearted people to support the most authoritarian shift in free societies since i’m not even sure what.  fair point though, but am i wrong to point out that obese 80 year olds often die even in years of no “global pandemic?”</p>

        <p>If you were an obese 80 year old that opposed the lockdowns, would you want people to chastize you and blame you for what is currently going on? </p>
<p>Also, I love how you say that what you are tired of is moralism and hysteria, yet you blame the obese 80 year olds, and not the much younger people that are likely in your age groups who are perpetuating much of the hysteria. People are very quick to blame the boomers and the obese, but hypocritically get mad when their own "kind" is blamed. </p>
<p>Though as I said, the ones to blame are the elites who are puppeteering this mess. The puppets are just mindlessly doing the puppeteers' bidding (and yes, they shoulder some blame, but going after them is going to do nothing but satisfy your own selfish lust for retribution).</p>

        <p>im not blaming, im saying it’s not unheard of that they die.  </p>
<p>i would care way more if I had my freedoms back.    Right now the (I think flawed) logic of these being preventable deaths of an a) endemic flu like virus, that effects mostly a population that was already facing severely shortened life wxpectancy, through extended and extreme society rupturing measures as a mandated remedy.</p>
<p>edit: long winded and harsh.  honestly, it almost should go without saying, and my bad for being so harsh about it, but vietnam was sold as winnable for years and years when ultimately it was found not to be many dead bodies and broken promises later.  thanks for challenging me on that, I honestly didnt enjoy making unwell old people even adjacent to the target - which i said is poli/news/hegemonic science</p>

        <p>I think this is the thing. As said 24 year old mine and 2/3rds of my friends lives are worse because of lockdowns when it's unlikely we'll even get symptoms from the disease. I know a lot of people who've lost their jobs, homes and savings and are back to square one trying to find work becoming more and more stressed. Applying for benefits and relying on food banks. Young people shouldn't be on benefits or on food banks.</p>

        <p>Teachers want them back, at least in less urban areas. They outright say most kids aren't learning as well, there's no ability to form a bond with the students and they are decided social interaction, which is dangerous to their mental health. Gym and sports also suffer. Love watching teachers in the teachers' lounge making jokes out of the usefulness of masks.</p>
<p>They need some kind of education. So long as someone is willing to stay home to home school them then it's fine.</p>

        <p>I read the post.</p>
<p>No offense, but is it really surprising? They even flip flop in the same thread that "this won't go on forever" then say "this will probably happen again so teach your kid that this is inevitable".</p>
<p>I feel like people here need to just stop posting about this stuff on other subreddits. They have made it abundantly clear they don't want any anti-lockdown, anti-mask content, and the users are thoroughly brainwashed into compliance. At this point, it's a waste of time to post anywhere else, whether it's to troll or to voice actual concerns. It's like screaming at a brick wall for hours.</p>

        <p>I think everyone should consolidate here, so we all know what the biggest concerns are and can think of ways to help and fight it; I think its so important we stick together.</p>
<p>I think mods could add some more tags, a parenting flair, for example. u/SpiderImAlright</p>
<p>I'm very interested to know what could be done to help parents who dont want their kids in school because of the mitigations or who still are places where in person school is closed/limited</p>

        <p>There is no use engaging with anyone who speaks disrespectfully to you. Your time and energy aren't worth it. There are lots of parents here- myself included- who are happy Talk and have the same concerns.  I'm sorry that happened to you. Their fear led them to their choices. They aren't able to do thinking logically or critically when they're operating in the brain stem. This thoughtful decision making comes from  the prefrontal Cortex which isn't engaged during times of stress and fear.</p>

        <p>I had a look at the thread where you got banned, and saw that you were being reasonable and not offensive.  I'm someone who's still trying to figure out what's true and what's false in all of this, so I'm not committed to either side of the argument.  But I do know something's wrong when reasonable people are being prevented from voicing their thoughts and feelings.</p>
<p>T'was a week or two ago that I saw a woman posting to one of the medical subreddits.  She had just received one of the Covid vaccines and was experiencing uncontrollable tremors, so of course she was worried.  She posted to this medical subreddit merely asking if anyone else who'd received the vaccine had experienced the same thing, was it normal, did she need to be concerned.  She even stated that she wasn't against vaccines, and was merely worried about these tremors.  It didn't escape me that she'd felt the need to make that clear about herself - that she wasn't an 'anti-vaxxer'.  Anyhow, I was curious about what responses she would get, so I saved the post.  Except her post was deleted within minutes, without so much as even one response.</p>
<p>Now how is that kind of thing supposed to not set off alarms for someone who's searching for the truth in all of this.  (Rhetorical question)</p>
<p>Sorry, I started out wanting to lend you some support and ended up venting.</p>

        <p>I unjoined the parenting/single parenting subs months ago. They were the reason I started using Reddit, but after the COVID hysteria I just couldn't even go on the subs. I think the posts about kids being encouraged to call out maskless strangers, and the fact people had upvoted and praised the posts, was the final straw for me.</p>
