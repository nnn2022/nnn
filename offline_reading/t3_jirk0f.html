<p>I met a lovely person on this sub, we're now in contact on a Discord server I created and we give each other support every now and then, when we need someone to talk to who won't judge and is on the same page.</p>
<p>Maybe more people on here would appreciate this kind of plan B if things go sour with the anti-narrative subs? You can send me a DM if you're interested in joining the Discord :)</p>

<p>&rt; No, because my current views are based on the totality of the evidence regarding covid/lockdowns, not my personal situation.</p>
<p>If my mother needs medical care and is unable to get it, that is <em>my personal situation</em>. </p>
<p>Because my current views are not based on my personal situation, but rather on the totality of evidence, my views will not be changed by a change in my personal situation. </p>
<p>They will change if and when the totality of evidence regarding covid/lockdowns ever warrants such a change. For instance, compelling data that covid is much worse than the data currently suggests may very well warrant a change in views. </p>
<p>My mother getting sick and being unable to get medical care would be a horrific tragedy that would haunt me forever. But it would not change my views, the same way a friend dying of alcohol poisoning would not change my view that alcohol should be legal. </p>
<p>That is what I mean by intellectual honesty: reaching conclusions based on sound reasoning and evidence, and not changing those conclusions based on my feelings or personal preferences.</p>

        <p>Ok.  So take your loved ones out of it since that seems to be clouding the issue. </p>
<p>And actually this isn’t a loaded question.  It’s an actual question in a sub that is supposed to be discussing this very thing.  </p>
<p>Question:  Will any of your current views change IF there comes a time when hospitals in your area become overwhelmed because of COVID patients and can no longer provide their most basic functions leaving people without adequate emergency care?   Do you hold your current views against the new normal because you believe this will not happen?</p>

        <p>Yes, it would change.  At least in terms of needing to do something about providing emergency care.  Based on the limited facts of your hypothetical provided, I can’t say much more than that.</p>
<p>But it has not happened in seven months.  My state bought a holding to turn into a morgue.  We were told to expect COVID-19 to overwhelm our hospitals.  It has not happened at any point.  I don’t expect it will based on the data I’m seeing.</p>

        <p>No, because this hasn’t actually happened anywhere in the United States, they’ve all had 8 fucking months to prepare for the possibility, and, frankly, if that unlikely scenario were to happen it’s more of a condemnation against for-profit healthcare than anything COVID did.</p>

        <p>It depends, to be honest. </p>
<p>One of the biggest reasons that folks oppose the lockdowns and restrictions and such is NOT at all because we don’t care, but because we care about more than one thing. </p>
<p>Pro-mandate, pro-lockdown people care about covid, and covid cases and covid deaths. They look at those numbers and support our response on that basis. </p>
<p>Believe it or not, I (and most here) care about those deaths as well. But I care about a lot more than that: </p>
<ul>
<li>the 10m+ people who are going to die needlessly of starvation </li>
<li>the massive increase in domestic (and non domestic) violence, both in frequency and severity</li>
<li>the impact on both life expectancy and lifetime earnings that lockdowns/remote learning will have on poor children </li>
<li>the people who missed chemo, or missed being diagnosed at all due to lockdowns, and are going to die of cancer that <em>should</em> have been successfully treated </li>
<li>the 30k excess alzheimers death in the US alone so far these year (it is well established that loneliness kills, and isolation is recognized torture; we literally tortured them to death for months in order to save them for covid) </li>
<li>and many more </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your question assumes that my position is based on not caring about other people, and nothing could be further from the truth.</strong> </p>
<p>I have come to my position based on a full consideration of the costs of covid and lockdowns; given all available evidence, I have concluded that lockdowns not only do not minimize total harm, they actually increase it. </p>
<p>From where I sit, <strong>you</strong> are the one who is selfish and doesn’t care about other people. But demonizing people is bad, and often wrong. The most likely explanation is that we both care about people and have simply come to different decisions about how to best minimize harm based on the facts. The difference is that I give you the benefit of the doubt, while you assume the worst about me. </p>
<p><strong>To answer your question:</strong></p>
<p>Because my view considers ALL the harms, not just one particular harm (like overcrowded hospitals), I can’t say how I would react based on a single factor. Basically, I’d put new values into the “equation” based on the change in hospitalization, and see whether the benefits vs costs of lockdowns have changed substantially. </p>
<p>But yes, I would in fact change my views if the facts changed in a way that made lockdowns clearly more beneficial than harmful.</p>

        <p>See, this trolley problem question is built to make us look bad. Damned if you do, damned if you don't. This question <em>may</em> have stood ground in March when medical facilities were scrambling. But since then, the pushing of vents has disappeared, field and floating hospitals came and went, and hospitals had plenty of time to prepare, stock up, and cross-train staff. Despite what the general belief is, there are plenty of healthcare professionals looking for work, its just that no one wants to pay them.</p>

<p>Take your loved ones out of it since that seems to be clouding the issue.</p>
<p>Question:  Will any of your current views change IF there comes a time when hospitals in your area become overwhelmed because of COVID patients and can no longer provide their most basic functions leaving people without adequate emergency care?   Do you hold your current views against the new normal because you believe this will not happen?</p>
<p>I live in Canada.  Our nurses and doctors have not been laid off but a lot of them are suffering mental health issues.  We have a different system here but I get what you are saying in a system wirh a profit model.</p>

        <p>I see you have replied to someone else with "take your loved ones out of it," so not sure if that was intended for my reply because I was not implying my loved ones in the trolley situation, but the general populace.</p>
<p>Since my views are multifaceted concerning the situation at hand (as I'm sure you acknowledge that there are many moving parts), my views would change, however not in favor of increased tyrannical measures but in an increased disdain due to inappropriate planning- the virus cannot be stopped, but these measures imposed imply that it can be stopped. Again, in developed countries (Canada included), there are resources that can be allocated to prepare for a potential "what IF a disaster happens" scenario. Especially given the attention this virus has been given. Even now people are either being turned away from emergency care or are so scared of this virus that they die at home from a preventable illness due to fear of contracting covid in a hospital, so the only difference between your hypothetical scenario versus what is happening is  physical vs psychological barriers to receiving care.  The virus would have to mutate into some truly deadly monster for me to change my views on the measures imposed (edit to add: meaning changing my views to pro-measures in this scenario). Actually, I was very pro-measures March into early April. However, the constant inconsistencies, self-contradicting, backpedaling, and nonsensical tyrannical measures (some imposed for the most ridiculous reasons given) did not measure up to what was (and still is) actually happening in real life (versus what the TV and social media are telling us).</p>
<p>Question for you: Would you think this virus was such a fatal one if you did not see it advertised everywhere?</p>

<p>That is a big assumption you are making about me. </p>
<p>Like most people, I understand that it is not as fatal as it first appeared to be in March. I understand that it is more fatal for the elderly and the medically vulnerable and has almost no fatality for people under 40.  I also know that in the months that have passed since March they have learned a lot about it and learned what treatments have a very low success rate, like ventilators.  Something that concerns me is the scenario where too many people have it at once and that impedes the ability for ordinary people to get the medical treatment they need for all manner of health problems.   I don’t want to have to go back a stage in my city because of too many hospitalizations.  I want my kids to be able to keep going to school.  I don’t enjoy  lockdowns and I see the suffering they cause.</p>

        <p>&rt;Covid-19 has an IFR of 1% and CFR of 2–3%. More recent data by the CDC and WHO, however, estimates that Covid-19 has an IFR of 0.65% and 0.5-1%, respectively.
&rt;The flu has an IFR of 0.1% or lower and CFR of 2–3%. (Please also see the 
update below about this.)</p>
<p>Cfr = case fatality rate = people that have symptoms
Ifr = infection fatality rate = people that are infected regardless of symptoms</p>
<p>So even if the mortality rate of covid vs the flu once you have symptoms is similar, you're more likely to get symptoms from covid than the flu</p>
<p>You're also more likely to get covid than the flu cause it's more infectious:</p>
<p>&rt;SARS-CoV-2 is more contagious with a basic reproductive number (R-naught) of 2.5. This means an infected person can pass the virus to two people or so, resulting in 2000+ infections after ten rounds of transmissions. The flu, by contrast, has an R-naught of 1.3, which equates to 56 infections after ten rounds</p>
<p>so their argument is that it has a lot more potential to overload the healthcare system than the seasonal flu, hence the lockdowns. also in general in the Before Time most pneumonia was bacterial and affected the very young and old. viral pneumonia was less common before and unlikely except for immunocompromised people  . You didn't have young people coming in with viral pneumonia and requiring respirators before . Yes I know these are very unlucky cases but you still have to treat them and can't just let them die</p>
<p>whether the lockdowns  will cause more harm than good in the long run , and how much of this is the political bureaucracy being comitted to a certain path by now , is another question</p>

        <p>that number is fake, go find me a source where CDC mentioned survival rates. From that you could also extrapolate <em>recovery rates</em> which would then give you some insane number  . So if we have 200,000 people dead from corona in the US, with a death rate of .2% (cause it's a survival rate of 99.8% apparently) , that would mean 100 million got the disease and recovered, impossible. Again I'm not saying it's ebola but you should consider that the websites you read are lying to you too or doing tricks to push their own agenda</p>
<p>also you live in a society so whatever the survival rate actually is, it's people who are usually treated . so whether or not you think the virus is fake , there will still be all these patients or crisis actors or whoever in the hospitals taking up space, so if anything happens to you or one of your loved ones and you need to go to the hospital too, you'll be SOL.</p>

        <p>Not an assumption, but was curious about how you perceive the information is presented to the population.</p>
<p>Proper organization would prevent the scenario you are worried about. Italy was a rare worst-case scenario in a country with poor healthcare, unprepared staff and an increased elderly population. In some places in the developed world, medical facilities reduced services because they were told to, then people were afraid to get the care they needed, and in some cases they shut down because they were afraid profits would take a dive and they shut their doors preemptively. Unfortunately, the trend that I am seeing is that if the powers that be want to move back a phase, they will do it anyway and come up with a new reason for it. Whether it be new cases (regardless of hospitalizations), protests, holidays, (unfounded) fear of gathering, etc they'll come up with something just to say there is a reason for it, as ridiculous as that reason may be. I empathize with your fear but I am also learning that we really don't determine what will happen next; our governments just make us think we do so that when they put out a new rule we will think it is our fault. Makes us tame and compliant. I know it sounds like tin foil hat material, but this year was a true eye-opener for me. I always figured the people who are supposed to serve us dont actually give much of a shit, but I didn't think it was to this extent. When you sweep the psyche and morale of your people under the rug for a virus with a very high survival rate, you're a tyrant. </p>
<p>I truly hope your children can continue attending school; it is so, so important for them. Stay strong.</p>

        <p>My province has a right wing government who is very reluctant to reimplement any restrictions.   If it happens it will only be as last resort.  The hospitals are not overwhelmed currently.  However as of last week they have started postponing surgeries in one of our cities in response to the Covid trajectory we appear to be on.  So there is some basis for the worry about our healthcare system.  We will find out soon enough if the system can handle it. </p>

        <p>That article sounds like the same broken record as everywhere else. There is a rise in <strong>cases</strong> that is not impeding other Healthcare, but we are going to shut it down anyway. "Just wait for that surge!" But there is none right now, so why shut down everything else? And that surge may never come! Why are the patients suffering as a result, are these people <em>that</em> bad at planning? There were <strong>months</strong> to properly plan for this exact scenario and they still just shut it down. Those surgeons and their staff are now sitting at home while their patients rot away for a literal "what if." Classic cutting off the nose to spite the face scenario, and in this case they're using the "rise in cases" reason which is their best one; you can blame your neighbor because you saw him go grocery shopping twice in one day and now you have to wait even longer to have that knee replacement. Just remember, if that surge happens the population will be to blame; if it doesn't, watch and see who takes credit for "saving lives."</p>
<p>Edit: just saw this headline: "Edmonton's drive-thru COVID-19 clinic a well-oiled machine" yet somehow the rest of the system is SO chaotic that they need to shut it down. Wait, no, it <em>might</em> be chaotic but we just don't know but <em>you</em> people caused this because cases so sowwy (cue "curb your enthusiasm" song)!</p>

        <p>The IUC's were never overwhelmed though. All the authorities models were horrifically wrong. What amazes me is people who support these measures keep talking about hypothetical scenarios and turning a blind eye to the obvious problems and growing negative effects of all these preventive measures and precautions. But we're the ones with our head up our butts...smh</p>

        <p>Lockdowns, social distancing, mask mandates, etc. My job was destroyed by the lockdowns, salary cut in half, contracts abandoned due to "safety concerns". My 3yr old hardly plays with kids cause everyone is so damn scared, savings shrinking. I think I got my last paycheck today due to my company abruptly moving out of our production facility last week. This shit is fucked and all I'm told is to suck it up. I worked hard for 5 years to grow our company and land contracts and it's all gone because people are scared of something they can't see.</p>

<p>But seriously, I don’t think they would, at least not permanently. And even if I did, do we ask victims families to decide the sentience for criminals or plane crash victims to decide on new safety regulations? Ideally no.</p>

        <p>I mean this genuinely, even if that question was in bad faith I'm going to assume it was in good faith. I'd have to answer no, because my views on the pandemic are not informed by appeals to my sense of guilt, but by the evidence currently as I see it. This is just a rehash of the 'no atheists in foxholes' argument - if any strong evidence that half of the stuff we're doing actually helps existed, then such fallacious arguments wouldn't need to be deployed.</p>
