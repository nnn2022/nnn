    <strong>"States are lifting restrictions are you happy now republican Karens"?</strong>
    <p><p>First off stop categorizing people who don't want to follow the restrictions or wear a mask as "Karens". Heck I am sure a lot of us look at the "Karens" we see on TV who are on our side and think they are crazy for acting out like they did. See I am sure a lot of us just want a peaceful way for folks to live their lives whether they want to wear a mask or not. So a lot of "confusion" or how people see us is just like how the media portrays cops. They show maybe a few bad cops on TV and then people think all cops are like that. "Oh well why are there so many bad cops on TV huh". <strong>THERE ARE OVER 50 STATES OF COURSE THERE IS GOING TO BE A BAD COP HERE AND THERE!</strong> Not everyone is good at their jobs. Which is why you can go to a place and get a really good server then the next time another server forgets to ever ask you if you'd like a refill. You get TSA agents who do actually follow the protocol, but then get a couple here and there who are too handsy. You can get the freshest fries from Mc Donald's one day and then awful cold fries the next time.   </p>
<p>Don't act like you're all high and mighty either for following the "rules". Or look down at people who don't follow them. The "rules" were meant to be "guidelines" of how people could go about handling Covid19. The fact the government used them to be able to tell people what to do is the main crime here. Not to mention there are still many situations where places are forcing you to wear a mask. Can't be maskless for air travel which a lot of people do, Can't be maskless on public transportation such as buses, trains or metros which is a fairly common use of transportation, and Can't be maskless if a business still requires you to wear one even when the state "reopened".   </p>
<p>Let's say the tables were reversed. How would you feel if a business did forbid you to wear a mask? Would you be upset? Throw a tantrum? Try to get the courts involved? Of course you would. So how is that not anymore "Karen" like then us not wanting masks or restrictions? You're doing the same thing trying to make other people live their lives the way <strong>YOU WANT THEM TO.</strong> Yet I supposed if you are a democratic "Karen" your more likely to get away with doing that crap.   </p>
<p>A lot of us just want places to <strong>GIVE US THE OPTION</strong> to wear masks or follow the guidelines. Instead of it being mandatory because if at the end of the day if a place didn't give you the option to wear or not wear a mask is not up to them. Them putting these "guidelines" in place is them saying right to our faces that they don't trust us to do the right thing.</p></p>

        <p>Businesses should deny entry to masked people. Wearing a mask into a business pre-covid could have you end up in the back of a squad car.</p>

        <p>I do find it ironic how in my state it went from "wearing any kind of mask in public is illegal" to "you must wear a mask in public to slow the spread" within the span of a week. I read something about some guy that wore a ski mask into the bank just to screw with the tellers. He scared them so bad but they couldn't say much because he was still masked. lol</p>

        <p>The Karen label is super racist.</p>
<p>It's like calling all black women Shanquilla.</p>
<p>Imagine of everytime a black lady was around everyone just started calling her Shanquilla. "But my name is actually Tracy" "Ok Shanquilla". That would be racist af. But it's perfectly acceptable to do it to white people.</p>
