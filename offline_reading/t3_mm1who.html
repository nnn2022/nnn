    <strong>If Covid isn't a scam how is it that states that have lifted their restrictions are doing well but the states that have restrictions are doing worse?</strong>
    <p><p>I think it's quite simple once when you think about why states likes Texas and Florida are doing well when states like NYC and MA aren't. It's because the fact the CDC still has control over MA and NYC so they are able to keep the fear going. Once they lost that fear with Texas and Florida they couldn't inflate the numbers anymore. Now they are trying to use Florida in the media being able to use the "Spring Breakers" excuse. Notice how cases come up during times when people would gather up and have fun? Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas, etc.</p>
<p>The other thing we have to take into account is notice how everyone is not worried getting the flu or sick anymore? Remember when you could just not feel well and have it not be because of Covid? It's also interesting that Covid and the Flu are SO SIMILAR, but Covid has taken over because it's worse. I apparently had Covid because a few people from my household tested positive and I've been around them the most, but you know what I never experienced any serious symptoms other than a sniffle. Sniffling isn't even on the symptom list for Covid yet I had it?! My household of the ones who did test positive also told me the same thing! No Fever, No Cough just a case of the sniffles. Covid is just a combination of allergies, getting sick like we would before and adding the flu ontop of it. Instead of saying we have allergies, sick and the flu they want to tell us we have Covid.</p>
<p>Whenever someone asks why you think Covid is a scam just ask them where the flu went.  </p>
<p>Edit: Sorry I meant to say this Pandemic is a scam. I am sure the virus is real, but I don't think it's as bad as the media is making it out to be. </p></p>

        <p>Places without nonsensical restrictions will be healthier do to being able to live and breath freely.   They have less stress on their systems, and therefore healthier bodies.</p>
<p>Also there is the nocebo effect which could be in play too.   In heavily restricted areas people may "think" themselves sick since all around them, they are told, is a deadly virus. </p>
<p>As for the tests... they are pretty much useless for telling how well an area is doing.   Always have been.   A "positive" test just means you have some fragments in your body that match a very small fragment of the sars-cov-2 virus.   That fragment could be from many sources and doesn't indicate viral infection.</p>

<p>This is such a massive, MASSIVE part of what's going on right now. Healthy mind and spirit is essential to a healthy body and immune system.</p>
<p>This isn't woo woo either. When you are in a constant state of fear, the body goes into fight or flight, meaning, more energy and blood flow to the limbs (so you can outrun the tiger), so the immune system's defences go down as the body focuses on the more immediate threat.</p>
<p>Placebo is a real thing, people can think themselves healthy and think themselves sick. That's why right now is so important to turn off the news. It's why people who don't care about the virus aren't affected by it.</p>
<p>I'd be willing to bet everything on the fact that since March 2020 the media is responsible for more deaths than covid.</p>
<p>If there has ever been a time to abandon the insanity of what people consider 'objective reality' and create your own, now is that time.</p>

        <p>It's not woo at all. Stress is known to impair the body's natural defenses. There's a reason people tend to get sick when they're feeling stressed out over a long period of time.</p>

        <p>David Icke said it best, if you control how you do the rt-PCR test, you can control the figures. If you say, you do 40 cycles of amplification, you can find almost anything in the human specimen you have collected.</p>
<p>If you look at the symptoms of COVID-19, they are practically almost the same thing as the influenza or the common cold.</p>
<p>Just like you,  I have a experienced a sniffle here and there but more mainly because of the weather cycles. Keep in mind, I am around folks all the time and zero.</p>

        <p>I disagree, I have never heard of someone personally losing their taste or smell/ long-covid before with the flu.</p>

<p>Not saying it doesn't happen, but with Covid those two things happen more often, my brother likely had Covid and lost his taste of smell for a couple of days.</p>

        <p>The taste/smell thing is real. Me and a few member of my family experienced it, and I've never had or heard about it in cold or flus. But I'm convinced "long covid" is psychosomatic symptoms and/or the result of people being locked inside, sedentary, eating poorly, and isolated for months on end.</p>

        <p>Covid gave me zero congestion whatsoever. Same with my whole family who got it at the same time. It was just sore muscles, a super mild cough, the smell/taste issues, and (for me) hives and super itchy hands and feet. Congestion had nothing to do with the lack of smell and taste.</p>

        <p>I lost my taste and smell from COVID and it was unlike any cold or flu induced smell loss I had before. Woke up one day with zero taste or smell, lasted 6 days, then just came back within hours. No congestion at all.</p>

        <p>COVID is not a scam. It's a real disease just like flu, cancer, diabetes, etc.</p>
<p>What IS a scam is the response. Masks demonstrably don't stop the spread of viruses. We have numerous scientific studies that prove this. Likewise for lockdowns, etc.</p>

        <p>Look I don't think it's necessarily a scam. Covid is likely real, just like the flu, it just isn't what they've made it out to be. Lockdowns and masks help spread infection covid or not (the latter is usually getting labeled as covid too sadly), so ending them helps. This is more important than just saying covid is fake, that makes lockdowns and masks <strong>useless</strong> when in reality they are <strong>harmful</strong>.</p>

        <p>The vast majority of the mortality numbers surrounding covid19 didn't even die OF covid19, they died WITH it if they had a positive test result within a certain number of days.</p>
<p>The glaring problem with that is the vast majority of these "cases" rely on a not fit for purpose PCR test, the whole thing is a massive scam.</p>

        <p>I agree with you.  COVID is indeed an illness, and we needed to pay some level of attention to it.  It has severe consequences for people with bad health outcomes, already, and the elderly.  Healthy individuals VERY RARELY have any adverse effects, or long-term issues with it.  Just like any other communicable seasonal virus.  It comes, you feel like crap, it goes, and it's over.  </p>
<p>It was used in 2020 for political convenience by the left.  They had cried wolf for 3 plus years, to no effect.  A month after the latest failed attempt at impeachment, it came front and center.  Some of us, me included, thought it needed special attention, around March/April of last year.  What I learned, come end of May/June, with the riots and behavior of many Americans, was that EVERYTHING was used for political convenience in 2020, so why wouldn't the virus?  Every tenant of "lockdown" culture was excused during the summer of 2020.  Bad behavior ensued, everywhere.  </p>
<p>TIL: virus is real, and damaging to people with already compromised health conditions.  Virus was used for political gain, when convenient.</p>

        <p>anyone have the links that show PCR doesn't distinguish well between different coronavirus species?  Did the public not know that they are one of the most common types of virus, and that the plan to use the research to produce bioweapons was suspected before 2019?</p>
<p>rather, is it possible to present a common sense summary of these trends after the inundation of lies?🤔</p>

        <p>I’ll use Victoria Australia as an example. They got fucked by the government. So when it got lifted.. literally even people feeling ill said fuck no to the test to stay off lists and to not ruin it for fellow citizens. So only the very ill went in. My guess is many Texans aren’t so curious to know if they have the coof now and most people who have it barely know anyway.</p>

        <p>"Doing well"</p>
<p>When this is just a measure of pcr+antigen positives, and there's no control for testing volume or strategy, and of course PCR has its myriad issues, these case counts are not an actual measure of anything.</p>
<p>So not saying you're wrong, but the entire narrative is attached to these case graphs and they're simply not usable data.</p>

        <p>Yeah I was around a friend for a whole weekend and he tested positive after. He said it was just like a bad cold and nobody else that was there never got any symptoms. The only person I know that has died bc of “covid” was old (past retirement age) and smoked cigarettes regularly. They already weren’t the healthiest person and every relatively healthy person either doesn’t show symptoms or it’s like the cold or flu</p>
