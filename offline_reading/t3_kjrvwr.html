    <strong>We have a nuance problem. The world is mostly shades of gray but SOME PEOPLE can only see black &amp; white</strong>
    <p><p>Seeing only black &amp; white is a sign of low intelligence. So when someone says, "you kill people for not wearing a mask" or you are anti-science for not wanting an experimental vaccine from people who have not been trustworthy in the past, I have to wonder who's connected to that screen name. I'm wondering if they are very very young with no life experience/sheltered, or possibly have some cognitive disability. I know many people with high functioning autism, and they seem to favor lockdowns because of their own discomfort of social situations, etc. They also seem to take to masks like fish to water as well. </p>
<p>On the other hand, people who have run businesses, understand economics, and have knowledge of government atrocities, Problem-Reaction-Solution, false flags, etc seem to all be opposed to what's happening. If you know the end goal of the rulers, you'll recognize what's happening in real time when they take the steps to get you there.</p>
<p>*I suppose it has to be pointed out that I am not attacking people with disabilities. There is a high probability that some members here are on the spectrum (&amp; 100% probability that EVERYONE here has people close to them that are). I am not automatically discounting anyone's opinion solely because of that.  I am also not saying that everyone who falls into that catagory is pro lockdown. I'm just making an observation from what I have noticed. I know I have to be very careful about that.  I would never intentionally try to make someone feel bad for something they have no control over.</p></p>

        <p>Kind of off topic, but wanted to add my experience. I bet you’re right that some people with social disabilities and are high functioning, don’t mind the restrictions. But I wanted to point out that the masks and lockdowns are severely affecting people with more severe autism or other disabilities. My cousin is severely autistic, he panics when he sees people with masks and my aunt can’t get him to wear one. His only joy in life was to ask strangers to “smile please”, he loved people smiling at him. So naturally, he freaks out because his brain can’t understand why people’s faces look so different now. He looks like a “normal” (whatever that means) 21 year old man, so he’s been harassed for not wearing a mask when out with my aunt and it sends him into a meltdown. The result? He hasn’t been able to leave their house since April or May. He’s severely depressed and has stopped eating much. Same with my aunt as a result. It’s really devastating for some of these people. He can’t even go to his job at the thrift store anymore or get in person therapy. It’s so fucked up. The doomers don’t care about the real human cost of these tyrannical orders.</p>

        <p>Yes, I was going to mention that. More severe autism, is more likely to have a problem with masks. I know one kid who rips it off as soon as the parents put it on him. They've been limiting him going in public because the stores will probably make him leave. And it could leave to a very severe behavior in public.</p>
<p>So sad about your cousin. It's extremely hard for them to adjust. Their routines are their lifelines and this is causing trauma.</p>

        <p>I agree. Black and white thinking is lazy thinking. It’s a problem both on the left and on the right. Call it out when you see it. </p>
<p>Keep in mind we are all susceptible to it. Some more than others. The smartest among us realize that the world is a trillion shades of grey.</p>
