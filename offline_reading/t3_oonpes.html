    <strong>It was silly of me to question things or care about anything other than Covid. From the bottom of my blackened, unvaccinated heart: I'm sorry.</strong>
    <p><p>Please can you accept my apology? I'd take choking on a government boot and Boris' sweaty dick over a ventilator any day. It was very silly of me to question the narrative; I was blinded by what my own eyes told me. It was downright foolish of me to refuse the holy elixir; after all, the chances of me getting a blood clot or unknown long term side effect are quite low really. Very, very silly of me to be concerned or afraid and not put my health at risk after spending a year locked inside and being forced to wear a mask that doesn't even fucking work so people who were going to die soon anyway wouldn't have their health put at risk.</p>
<p>It was pig-ignorant of me to suggest an alternative to lockdowns that would focus on protecting the elderly and vulnerable without collapsing the economy and shutting down society. I'm not a Scientist! LOCKDOWNS ARE THE ANSWER. THEY WILL WORK EVENTUALLY. It was fucking downright blasphemous of me to distrust politicians and celebrities who have flaunted the rules at every turn and have shown themselves to be corrupt, sleazy and self-serving throughout modern history. I'm sure they have our best interests at heart and they really, really care about the scary coronavirus.</p>
<p>It was delusional of me to think my fellow No New Normalites were anything but misinformation spewing variant factories swimming in a petri dish; I was suckered in by the fact that they aren't total arseholes calling for medical tyranny and genocide. DO NOT be fooled by the friendly, freedom-loving, truth-seeking veneer: they are part of the ANTI-VAX agenda!!! I don't know what that agenda is but it is scary and dangerous, you guys! We all need to STOP RESEARCHING, STOP QUESTIONING, AND STOP COMPLAINING. BEHAVE, OBEY AND PROTECT THE FUCKING NHS.</p>
<p>I want to be part of the crowd, I want to perform a noble sacrifice, I want to BELIEVE. Please teach me how to shut my brain off; I want to watch videos of nurses dancing on Tik-Tok and not cringe and question how they have the fucking time to choreograph, rehearse and perform those elaborate routines during a literal Global pandemic. I want to watch my Disney+ and not question why film and television productions could go ahead with filming if things are so bad that the entire fucking World had to grind to a halt. I want to attend football games and cheer on the players without the nagging thought in the back of my mind that I can't even have a wedding without masks on everyone and no singing and dancing.</p>
<p>What brought about this sudden revelation? Well, it was Boris announcing on "Freedom Day" that nightclubs will require two jabs for entry starting from September. It was all the lovely comments on Twitter, Reddit and Facebook calling for the unvaxxed to be put in camps and murdered; comparisons to The Holocaust are NOT WARRANTED and NOT WELCOME, thank you very fucking much. It was the free doughnuts. It was being cornered like an animal and beaten down over and over again by the government and its mindless supporters. It was my mental health on the verge of fucking snapping and the milky, judging eyes of the ~~fat~~ fit and healthy guy on a ventilator expressing regret for not getting the heckin' Fauci ouchie.</p>
<p>It just showed you really, really cared about my well-being and that everything is totally fucking normal. I overreacted and a two-tier society sounds swell. Everything is better now. We are building back better towards a glorious Utopia, free from misinformation and the common cold. I will own nothing and be happy. Not even my own body will belong to me. Freedom is slavery and 2+2=racism. I will wear a mask and purge myself of any individuality. This is all worth it if it saves just one life, even if it means suicides and vaccine deaths.</p></p>
