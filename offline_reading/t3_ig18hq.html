        <p>Choice bits:</p>
<p>&rt; “The numbers have been as good as they’ve been since the beginning,” Murphy said during his press briefing in Trenton. “We keep sustaining this we’re going to get to a lot of the questions that you’re asking about — whether it’s indoor dining, gyms, indoor amusements."</p>
<p>&rt; The state health department announced 225 new cases of the respiratory illness (187,719 total) since March 4. All three of the new deaths took place in August. Nine other deaths, believed to be linked to COVID-19, took place across Garden State hospitals yesterday but have yet to be lab-confirmed. As of today, there have been 14,120 total confirmed coronavirus deaths and another 1,829 considered “probable.”</p>
<p>&rt; Currently, 446 people are being hospitalized for the virus — 55 of which are in intensive care and 27 require ventilators.</p>
<p>&rt; “I hope sooner than later we'll have some news on getting to some of the indoor stuff [but] I’m not going to marry myself to a date yet,” Murphy said.</p>
<p>&rt; With New Jersey’s coronavirus figures at a good place, one reporter asked state health officials what would need to improve at this point in order to prompt the governor to further lift indoor restrictions. </p>
<p>&rt; “I don't think there's a single metric that that is going to tell us when it's going to be safe to begin to reopen. More generally, I think all of us have been watching what is happening. Not just in the rest of the country but in the rest of the world,” State Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said today.</p>
<p>&rt; “And an example would be New Zealand, which went 100 days without a single case and are now having to revisit some of their restrictions because I believe… people [began going] across the border into New Zealand," she continued. "So I think all of this is just a reminder to us that the virus is still here. It has not gone away.”</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>&rt; According to Tilghman, three subcommittees were formed out of the commission to home in on health issues, public/social policy issues and economic issues in the interest of long-term recovery. Despite the hot temperatures this afternoon, Tilghman acknowledged the colder seasons to come and what that might mean for the loss of outdoor opportunities.</p>
<p>&rt; “The weather is going to turn at some point and people are not going to be able to experience the great outdoors the way we can now. And that is a major risk,” she said.</p>
