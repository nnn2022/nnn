        <p>Argh. This is a fucking strawman and you know it.</p>
<p>Cloth masks are like normal seatbelts: they'll reduce your risk of getting COVID-19, but they won't eliminate the risk. In an ideal world, everybody would have a respirator, but because of capitalist outsourcing, that couldn't happen. Seatbelts also don't prevent you from dying in horrible accidents, but installing a crash cage and required helmets in every car is simply too expensive to be practical, as with giving everybody a respirator. However, both seatbelts and masks significantly reduce your risk.</p>

        <p>Yup. Only a property fitted N95 mask has any potential to protect the wearer, but even N95 masks aren’t rated to filter out particles as small as a virus. </p>
<p>I used to think that masks helped contain the spread of pathogens to some extent when worn by a sick person, so I used to wear them out when I was sick with a headcold or whatever. After reading a lot of studies showing that masks have pretty much zero impact, and that they in fact may accelerate infection rates, I’ve decided to stop doing even that.</p>

<p>From first link:</p>
<p>&rt; Johnson and colleagues tested the performance of surgical and N95 masks to filter virus in nine volunteers with confirmed influenza A or B virus infection [7]. Participants coughed five times onto a Petri dish containing viral transport medium held 20 cm in front of their mouth. The experiment was repeated with subjects wearing a surgical mask, and wearing an N95 respirator. While influenza virus could be detected by RT–PCR in all nine volunteers without a mask, no influenza virus could be detected on the Petri dish specimens when participants wore either type of face mask.</p>
<p>From second link:</p>
<p>&rt; Any type of general mask use is likely to decrease viral exposure and infection risk on a population level, in spite of imperfect fit and imperfect adherence, personal respirators providing most protection. Masks worn by patients may not offer as great a degree of protection against aerosol transmission.</p>
<p>From third link:</p>
<p>&rt; Eight of nine retrospective observational studies found that mask and/or respirator use was independently associated with a reduced risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).</p>
<p>From fourth link:</p>
<p>&rt; Cloth does not stop isolated virions. However, most virus transmission occurs via larger particles in secretions, whether aerosol (&lt;5 µm) or droplets (&rt;5 µm), which are generated directly by speaking, eating, coughing, and sneezing; aerosols are also created when water evaporates from smaller droplets, which become aerosol-sized droplet nuclei. The point is not that some particles can penetrate but that some particles are stopped, particularly in the outward direction. Every virus-laden particle retained in a mask is not available to hang in the air as an aerosol or fall to a surface to be later picked up by touch.</p>
<p>&rt; Outward protection for cloth masks was extensively studied decades ago, and the results are highly relevant today. Compared with bacteria recovery from unmasked volunteers, a mask made of muslin and flannel reduced bacteria recovered on agar sedimentation plates by 99.3% to 99.9%, total airborne microorganisms by 99.5% to 99.8%, and bacteria recovered from aerosols (&lt;4 µm) by 88% to 99% (6). A similar experiment in 1975 compared 4 medical masks and 1 commercially produced reusable mask made of 4 layers of cotton muslin (7). Filtration efficiency, assessed by bacterial counts, was 96% to 99% for the medical masks and 99% for the cloth mask; for aerosols (&lt;3.3 µm), it was 72% to 89% and 89%, respectively.</p>
<p>From sixth link:</p>
<p>&rt; Hypothetical mask adoption scenarios, for Washington and New York state, suggest that immediate near universal (80%) adoption of moderately (50%) effective masks could prevent on the order of 17–45% of projected deaths over two months in New York, while decreasing the peak daily death rate by 34–58%, absent other changes in epidemic dynamics. Even very weak masks (20% effective) can still be useful if the underlying transmission rate is relatively low or decreasing: In Washington, where baseline transmission is much less intense, 80% adoption of such masks could reduce mortality by 24–65% (and peak deaths 15–69%), compared to 2–9% mortality reduction in New York (peak death reduction 9–18%). Our results suggest use of face masks by the general public is potentially of high value in curtailing community transmission and the burden of the pandemic. The community-wide benefits are likely to be greatest when face masks are used in conjunction with other non-pharmaceutical practices (such as social-distancing), and when adoption is nearly universal (nation-wide) and compliance is high.</p>

<p>About your point on hand washing, government-enforced hand washing would be far harder to enforce than mask wearing.</p>
<p>Ignoring the fact that masks help protect others as well as yourself (you've probably heard this a million times already), even if you're young and in good shape, there's still a substantial chance (10-15%) that you'll get a nasty case of pneumonia - not enough to kill you, but nobody wants to get pneumonia.</p>
<p>Plus, there's also the risk for getting chronic fatigue-like syndrome lasting for months after you've "recovered" from COVID-19.</p>
