        <p>I fail to see how these are connected.</p>
<p>Medically assisted dying isn't limited to elderly people; younger people with terminal illnesses or conditions can take advantage of it too. It is a humane measure for people who are <em>already dying,</em> of any cause, so they can choose to have a peaceful exit.</p>
<p>Not all elderly people are actively dying, or want to die any time soon--especially isolated in a hospital due to Covid, and cut off from family. There's nothing wrong with taking reasonable precautions to protect people in high-risk populations who don't want to die, which includes a lot of younger people with various health issues.</p>
<p>Extended lockdowns that have destroyed countless businesses, hastened an economic meltdown, and created a massive mental health crisis are not reasonable precautions--I agree with that. But passage of the Medically Assisted Dying bill is not some fresh insult against struggling small business owners who have had their livelihoods upended due to the lockdowns.</p>

        <p>These things are not equivalent. Lockdowns are draconian. Don't let that sour the outlook on freedom, generally.</p>

        <p>This is kind of where I was going with this! We allow anyone and everyone the right to end their lives over their health burdens while our government actively creates dozens of other burdens for us all. Sorry if there are people out there that don’t seem to understand this phenomenon is going to cost the surviving taxpayer for decades to come. My own grandmother pities what our “millennial” and younger generations will have to deal with in the coming years.</p>

        <p>This Pandemic is being propped up by Millenials. They are the 20-40 age group that is supposed to be the healthiest and most likely to protest against the machine. But they have been fed a diet of Propaganda and misinformation by the Canadian Government and Educational system and now they are weak and disinfranchised and are doubling down with their children. </p>
<p>There seems to be zero ability to critically think anymore. In the next 10-15 years more than 2 billion Boomers are going to die and leave their kids and Grandkids all their wealth. But these Millenials have been trained to believe that they are poor and helpless. But they are the largest age group after Boomers and they have all the agency but they are oblivious. </p>
<p>The Millenials will vote in Wealth taxes and Inheritance Taxes right before they get the keys to the kingdom. They actually think Billionaires will be giving up their wealth even though they know deep inside that the 1% has their money out of country and untouchable.  </p>
<p>Millenials have no clue that they will be paying every borrowed penny back and many will never retire because of the debt they allowed to grow. </p>
<p>The Zoomers and Covid-kids will hate Millenials more than Millenials hate Boomers. It's sad.</p>

        <p>"experience unbearable physical or mental suffering from your illness, disease, disability or state of decline that cannot be relieved under conditions that you consider acceptable"</p>
<p>This statement concerns me as it implies someone experiencing depression is within their right to go through medically assisted suicide. I won't get into the efficacy of MAID with other forms of suffering, but I do worry about people experiencing mental suffering especially after a pandemic. I feel this does not address the root cause of the mental suffering nor does it provide a benefit to the individual or society. </p>
<p>This should really be amended to be more specific, or not be used with depression. Just my 2 cents. </p>
