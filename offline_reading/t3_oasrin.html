    <strong>They fucked it. They over shot.</strong>
    <p><p>As you know, the WHO has actually recommended against kids getting vaccinated, even though they say "for now"  and make out it's because vaccines are scarce and we need to get adults everywhere, including poorer countries, vaxxed before using "precious vaccines" for children in rich countries.</p>
<p>Government SAGE sceintists group in the UK is also NOT recommending in favour of vaxxing kids atm.</p>
<p>I think this is because they know that these vaccines will injure kids which would reveal to the world how insane and dangerous their whole indiscriminate rollout of experimental vaccines has been from the beginning.</p>
<p>They vaccinated the very elderly and frail first because it is easy to hide their deaths. They even had articles in the media saying "don't be surprised if elderly people start dying after vaccination". They said this is because those elderly people were gonna die anyway (which of course they never say when its covid deaths instead of vaccine deaths).</p>
<p>They can even say that adults occasionally get myocarditis and just keel over on football pitches. "These things  are rare, but we expect them to happen from time to time. It's just one of those things, and it has nothing to do with the vaccines".</p>
<p>But how are they going to explain a lot of serious adverse reactions or even deaths among <em>children</em>? That doesn't sit so well. I think they know this and the WHO etc really actually doesn't want the kids to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>Trouble is, they pushed it way too far with the fear factor, doubleplus mutant scariants and all of that, when they needed to justify vaxxing every adult, muzzling, and repeatedly locking us down.</p>
<p>They pushed it so far that the media and even parents are now screaming to get vaccines for their kids.</p>
<p>They ramped up the fear too high and people are now reaching for stupid all by themselves.</p>
<p>Either that or there are some real sick fucks who just enjoy seeing people volunteer themselves and their kids for these vaccines, even if it goes against official advice.  If it all goes badly wrong they can still say "we didn't recommend it".</p></p>

        <p>The other problem the WHO and other health bodies have, is they can't come straight out and say "these vaccines are still experimental and it's just too risky to give them to children" because it calls the whole thing into question.</p>
<p>What, it's dangerous at 17 and a half, but completely safe all of a sudden when you turn 18? Where is the line? Let's face it, there is no safety line. These vaccines can hurt anybody of any age. Once it's acknowledged that anybody at all can be hurt, people will start to realise that means that <em>anybody at all can be hurt</em></p>

        <p>Correct me if I'm wrong either moderna or astrazensa has a recommended age of 18+ for men and 30+ for women. If that doesn't sound like a broken vaccine then I don't know what is.</p>

        <p>I agree, there's likely tiers that know what's up, and tiers that know a bit of what's up, and tiers below them that <em>think</em> they know what's up, etc. I mean the money making part of it is definitely going on, but that's probably as far as a lot of people who think they know the score are aware of. Beyond that a lot of them will be clueless. But I tend to think there is more to it as well.</p>

<p>Boy, doesn't that sound familiar... What once wasn't a compelling argument is now the go-to. At least it appeals to common sense. Too little, too late.</p>

        <p>&rt;to complete the mind control?</p>
<p>I mean that's a possibility. A scary one, but I have thought about it as a "what if?".</p>
<p>It would break a lot of people if they vaccinated kids and there were a lot of injuries. And as a society everyone would feel like "how could we have let this happen?" There'd be so much guilt and shame and confusion. They might even manage to find ways to blame people who were warning against the vaccines. Like shoot the messenger stuff.</p>
<p>People would be so scared, confused and betrayed, they could wind up easy prey for anyone who seemed to offer leadership and solutions.  I think especially the shame and grief would paralyse people's capacity to think for themselves any more. People would no longer trust themselves or each other to make decisions because the things they trusted and decided to support would have let them down badly. They might even welcome a dictatorship regime that would take all the decisions away from them after that.</p>
<p>It's a worrying thought. I hope it never happens.</p>

        <p>You are absolutely spot on. 
Imagine if they announced they were vaxxing kids back in April/May 2020.
Most adults would have questioned it immediately. 
But now we have had 15/16 months of this continuous crap, the whole mindset of most adults has changed on a massive scale. 
This is why it was ramped up to the maximum. 
Most parents won't want to risk not letting their child have it in case they get it and then have life long "long covid" symptoms. 
The shot they give kids will be different and possibly cause infertility thus lowering the population by default in the next 20 years. 
All its taken is to run this high level media onslaught of propaganda on adults, most are parents, grandparents, uncles, aunts, big brothers, big sisters etc. 
High influencers and role models for kids. 
This is what all this has been about. 
See the game. See the con.</p>
