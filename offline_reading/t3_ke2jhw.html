    <strong>Now You Draw The Line</strong>
    <p><p>I live in MN which started another shutdown early November as hospitalizations and deaths began (appeared) to spike. Over 150 restaurants are planning to open next week after the restrictions are set to expire, regardless if they are extended. </p>
<p>Many doomers are absolutely losing it here. “Arrest these owners”, “they are killing people”, “they are putting my life in danger”, etc. etc. </p>
<p>I just can’t help but question these doomers’ competency. For example, These restaurants were open for indoor dining of some level for 4-5 months. We have over 1,000 deaths during that time allegedly attributed to CoVID. These people weren’t begging Gov. Walz to shut restaurants down. They simply chose to not go there if they felt unsafe. </p>
<p>But now!!!!! Any owner who opens is killing people. So those 1,000+ people don’t matter? Just fuck them? Now you draw the line? Get off your high horse. I could actually respect someone who demanded these restrictions since March to save as many lives as possible. But I don’t respect these people who flip flop because Gov. Walz says so. </p>
<p>You have the ability to protect yourself if you are worried. Let the rest of us live.</p></p>

        <p>Agreed. Those people who are so worried about catching CoVid-19 can stay the hell home if they are so worried about it.</p>
<p>The rest of us will realize that this virus has an IFR of .2% in the general populace and .01% in the people under 50 years of age.</p>
<p>We don't need masks. We don't need lockdowns. The older people just need to be told to stay home if they are worried and we need to investigate why nursing homes are having these large outbreaks at them.</p>
<p>If it is coming from the nursing home workers, then some restrictions on those workers would be reasonable... including making them avoid bars and clubs if those places spread CoVid-19 to excess.</p>
<p>However from what the doctors are now telling us, the usual place to catch CoVid-19 is? Your own damned home!</p>
