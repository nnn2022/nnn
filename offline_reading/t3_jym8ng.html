    <strong>My father of old age wants me to get married but I can't due to covid?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm 27. My father is in old age now, and 2020 has been a terrible year for him. He's had a series operations this year and top of that, he has dementia. He's had dementia for 2 years, however since its operations it's gotten much worse.</p>
<p>For the last couple of years he's been urging me to get married because he wants to see my wife before he passes away. I've not been able to get to that point due to finances. Now I'm stable, however me and my mother are his full time carers, and we don't have the energy to do anything else apart from caring for him.</p>
<p>It's gotten to that point where he thinks I'm married with 12 children. Its pretty sad to hear him say that. I just don't know what to do, especially with all this Covid shit going on.</p>
<p>Ant advice?</p></p>

        <p>I’m confused.  He want a you to get married.  Do you have any takers on your offer, or that you should just find someone and marry them?  But he already thinks you have 12 children?</p>
<p>Someone else wanting you to is no reason to marry.</p>

        <p>I think it’s best to humor people with dementia. Why make them sad if they are going to soon forget it.</p>

        <p>If he has dementia ... just play along with the story of the moment. </p>
<p>There has been research on this. Trying to correct him will just hurt him - it is important that he be happy and calm and enjoy the time he has left with you as best he can; it doesn’t matter at all whether he has his facts straight. </p>
<p>Think about it this way: </p>
<p>Your father’s ability to fully live in the real world is very restricted now, so he’s constantly building worlds in his mind. Help him make them happy, soothing worlds that put a smile on his face. </p>
<p>I’m so sorry for you and your parents. I wish you the best, and wish I could do more.</p>
