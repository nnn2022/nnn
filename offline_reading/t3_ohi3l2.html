    <strong>Pay attention to what the news media is talking about and watch the narrative switch</strong>
    <p><p>I have predicted from Day 1 of the Covid insanity that the news media will eventually switch sides, and the narrative about the dangers of Covid will change. Eventually, the media will begin reporting how we have been 'duped', followed by a million stories about those people who were killed or severely injured with the vaccine.</p>
<p>That switch is coming...(wait for the massive stock market crash financial analysts expect soon, and watch the usual Covid narrative to vanish completely).</p>
<p>For evidence of this, take a look at CNN's front page now and in coming weeks, and you will see fewer and fewer stories about Covid are emerging.</p>
<p>Why? Because most people are tired of it so are no longer clicking on their articles-obsessed-about-Covid, so now they have to find something else to scare us with.</p>
<p>Remember, the role of the news media is not about informing it is about getting as many eyes as they can on the stuff they spew in order to make as much money as possible. </p>
<p>When they are no longer making that money on articles about Covid, which they are obviously not as almost every article would still be Covid-based as it has been for the last year and a bit, the narrative will change.</p>
<p>Today, the CNN homepage is all about Europe exporting emissions to the U.S. (more fear), Biden firing the SSA official, extreme temperatures out west (yet more fear), followed by Richard Branson's space flight and a whole lot of other subjects few of us care about.</p>
<p>Expect more of this and less of 'Covid will kill you' coming to a computer screen near you....</p>

        <p>That’s how the left works, just like with the “defund the police movement”</p>
<p>“That wasn’t us, that was the Republicans”</p>
<p>I made a bet with a friend who is hard left leaning that sometime this year the narrative will switch, it will go from lockdowns and stay inside to “why did we ever lock down? That was dumb. Cost so many lives, can’t believe they did this!”</p>
<p>It’ll come. Sooner or later this year.</p>

        <p>I've been saying that from about Day 2 of the Covid bullshit. The narrative switches, it always does, and the people the news media were once supporting they then attack.</p>
<p>I'm just interested to hear what the pro-vaxxers have to say when that switch happens. How will they persuade themselves they were 'on the right side' all along?</p>

        <p>Honestly they will probably enjoy getting to play the "victim" and cry about how they were manipulated. Never considering that they, for the most part, made an effort to bring as many people down with them as possible. I know people fully aware of the risk, conceding it seems "fishy," but still getting the jab due to external pressures. The ones doing the pressuring will scream the loudest about their outcomes in the end.</p>

        <p>I’m just talking about within the US. At first the left didn’t want to lock down, when the virus first became an issue in the US, Pelosi and other leaders high in the pecking order actually made it very clear that lockdowns wouldn’t happen and the virus isn’t anything to worry about…</p>
<p>But then they realized they could use the virus and lockdowns to force Trump out of their little elite group, so they started to push for lockdowns out of nowhere.</p>
<p>Now that it’s all over, the left is starting to point fingers, just like the defund the police movement. “No that wasnt us that was Republicans”</p>
<p>And same will happen with lockdowns now that it is all over. “That wasn’t us….”</p>

        <p>I can agree with that. No matter who is in charge will blame it on someone else. I live in Ontario. I had the same political leaders the whole time. Not sure who they are planning on blaming it on. </p>
<p>If I had to guess, since they can't really blame it on the opposition, they will blame it on the unelected experts.</p>

        <p>A lot of people don't seem to realize that "news organizations" aren't in the business of reporting the news.  Their money comes from selling access to their viewers.. aka advertising. </p>
<p>Whatever brings in the eyeballs is what they are going to pursue.  Usually that's the fear if the week </p>
<p>Plus, they hate being the last to push a story, as they might lose the eyeballs to a competitor. So meticulous fact checking goes out the window due to time pressure.</p>
