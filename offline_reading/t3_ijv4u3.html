    <strong>How do y’all do it?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m so sick and tired of being peer pressured into wearing a mask. How do y’all go about your daily lives without masks? Any tips for getting into stores and such? I’m in Texas if that makes any sort of a difference.</p></p>

        <p>Don't go to stores that enforce it. Wear it around your neck, but don't put it on unless you're asked politely. I've only been asked by one grocery cashier and haven't gone back to that store. I shop at locally owned grocery stores and the owners are forced to have signs up and make their staff wear them, but they don't want to. Sometimes I go to the more "ghetto" stores because they're less uppity and the staff have more important things to worry about than enforcing face rags.</p>

        <p>My wife wears headphones and sunglasses and ignores everyone.  My trick is to remind myself that I'm not doing this as a protest, but to possibly inspire one other person to do the same.  I'm not there to fight a bunch of people, I'm there to help one person.  YMMV but thinking like that makes it easier for me.</p>

        <p>I'm not in Texas so I can't comment on what it's like there but I'm simply immune to peer pressure; I don't give a shit what most other people think. I do however care about being kicked out of buildings I need to be in (or arrested for trespassing), so in cases where it simply cannot be avoided I just wear the stupid thing. I did however read the requirements by my local tyrant, and so I got a mask that fully (and barely) adheres to what's required.</p>

        <p>Just do it. Seriously. With your head held high. And smile. Your heart might beat a little harder too. But once you're done in the shops and out the door, it feels good. And we even find a lot of the employees to be quite nice. They know that you know it's bullshit, but if they want to get paid, they have to wear it. You don't. And one last thing, think of all of us here on NoNewNormal cheering you on. Because we are!</p>

        <p>Here in NY you can't really get away with not wearing a mask in the store, and 99.99% of people comply so you'll definitely stick out like a sore thumb.  Of course in my heart I'd like to make a statement, but in real life it's not worth the risk of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pwp2MdtIK2M">some batshit crazy assholes literally dragging you out of the store</a>.</p>
<p>What I do is I wear it for the bare minimum time necessary.  Don't put it on until I'm in halfway in the door, and I take it off while I'm walking out.  Never wear it in the parking lot or any other outdoor place.  At work, I don't wear it in my office, and since I come in earlier than everyone else I roam the halls/rest of the building without it until people start filtering in.  And I don't wear it while walking around my neighborhood or socializing with the neighbors, that's utter bullshit.  We all trust each other in my neighborhood, don't find it necessary, and don't want to dehumanize people we like and are friendly with..</p>

        <p>Not trying to be contrarian, but</p>
<p>1) there are WAY worse things than sticking out like a sore thumb, and </p>
<p>2) if you’re scared or embarrassed for not conforming; that’s okay and it’s natural - but own it. Don’t say people will drag you out of the store for not wearing one. They may drag you out if you melt down or cause a scene and absolutely refuse - but if you take it off in the produce aisle and some asshole employee says something to you, you can put it right back on and keep shopping. So it’s it’s fallacy of false dilemma (wear one and be safe and or don’t wear one and literally end up in a YouTube video). Again, if you’re too embarrassed to do it there’s not shame in that, but it’s not fair to say there isn’t a safe way to do it. There is.</p>

        <p>I'm in Texas too. My trick is to ignore everyone. If you can do that on a conscious level, wear headphones. If confronted, tell them you have a medical condition and leave it at that. If they make you leave, tell them you're taking your business elsewhere.</p>

        <p>I wear it at work, it bothers me less there because they're paying me to be there, they don't make any exceptions, and they already have plenty of picky rules. And giving me free masks. Outside of that, I mostly stopped. All stores I've seen have the "masks required" signs because Governor A-Butt forced them to, but not all stores do anything else about it.</p>
<p>Gas stations IME are the least likely to give a damn - you're in and out in a few minutes and it's not really worth it for them to bother you. Anywhere, maintain physical distance from people you don't know, and quietly walk in and shop. If anybody who works there bugs you about it, say you have a medical exemption, and if they insist, politely leave. I only had to say it was medical once and they left me alone. It's technically true, it's just not a <em>serious</em> medical condition - I need to go mask-free on my days off to help get rid of the acne and mild rash from wearing it on work days.</p>
<p>You can start smaller too. Try carrying it with you and only putting it on if you're asked directly. Or wear a thin scarf and put it only over your mouth.</p>

        <p>The one time I was told to wear a mask was at gas station. I walked in and the woman at the counter immediately said “you need to wear a mask in here ma’am” and I simply walked out. </p>
<p>Remember you always have a choice where you do business. As much as people like to think that you’re “putting other people’s lives in danger” by not wearing a mask, you’re really not as long as those people stay the fuck away from you.</p>

        <p>At first (back when they were mandated) I had my shopping list and beelined to stuff I need.  Now I just DGAF.  Walk in, get groceries, wonder around, be normal.  </p>
<p>I've never been asked to leave a grocery store but I've avoided Walmart since about April (or when ever Wolf mandated masks in PA) because I think they will enforce in my area.  Its pretty rural around me but walmart is in the city.</p>
<p>I have been asked to leave my no longer beloved Sheets (a gas station without a good analog in TX).  I've been asked to leave McDonalds, and a handful of other places.  No argument I just leave.  It happens so inoften that I never thought of a generic response.</p>

        <p>I go to HEB, they don't enforce it at least here in Round Rock. I avoid 7-11 I got kicked out, lol. Circle K was pretty lax too. I also used to live by a gas station and the late shift guys wouldn't bug me. The owner works in the morning so I just wait till the evening to get beer and stuff.</p>

        <p>after saying, that i have a medical attest, no one asks a question anymore usually and i do have a universal one, that some doctors may give u the right to print out the pdf and fill out your name on it to have one.</p>
<p>if the stores say, that medical attest are not enough, then don't go there and also content the business and tell them, that they ignore your medical requirements, etc... etc...</p>
<p>as sometimes u might just be dealing with some insane  people working in the shops, that don't even represent the business as a whole.</p>
<p>also  here, there was a bullshit insane mask phase, then it stopped and now it is back, so it seems from my feeling, that most people working in shops already feel, that it is annoying senseless bullshit and want it over too.</p>
<p>however this may vary heavily from country to country and i have no idea how insane the public in texas is.</p>
<p>also chose your shops and if possible go directly to the supplier. for example go to the local organic farmers, rather than the super markets if possible. it is far less likely, that they are insane i would say and they aren't   dealing with corporate criminal guidelines.</p>
<p>also, if u are already very terrified about the insanity, then go with friends shopping.</p>

        <p>My biggest problem is that it’s making my acne go crazy. I’ve always had a little acne since high school, mostly around my forehead though. Since wearing masks, I’ve been getting painful cystic acne on my cheeks and jaw. Other than that, I’ve read so many articles about them not actually being effective, and I’d rather get it and build immunity than run away from it. Just my personal opinions, but you asked so I’m happy to oblige :)</p>
