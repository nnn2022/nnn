    <strong>What in the FK happened to our rights?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm Australian and it's really spooky how we just accepted our right to freedom of movement to be shut down so easily.</p>
<p>It used to be shocking when one state was closed down. But now it's normal to have states closed down for months on end. (Making it illgeal to vist them or leave them.)</p>
<p>In sydney some parts It's even illgeal to move out of your suburb. (Blacktown, Liverpool, ect.)</p>
<p>They've also made it illgeal to protest giving people thousands of dollars in fines. There is also currently over five thousand police officers, army and federal police on the streets today checking cars one by one to see if they're in the right suburb. </p>
<p>https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://amp.smh.com.au/national/nsw/exclusion-zone-police-checkpoints-in-place-to-prevent-protests-in-sydney-s-cbd-20210731-p58enp.html&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiCktvbqIzyAhXTZSsKHXDnCeMQvOMEegQIDRAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw3C0_eWflU2gj2CLJ_6QZtV&amp;ampcf=1</p>
<p>This is no longer a health reason. This is a police state. If freedom of movement and protesting is illgeal then your country isn't free.</p></p>

        <p>To be the honest the UK hasn’t had guns in a long time and here we are just carrying on as if nothing is wrong at the moment even with some of the highest cases in the world there are barely any restrictions. </p>
<p>What on Earth is going on across the ponds over a few hundred cases? It’s mind blowing. Your governments were 100% ready to bend you all over and Roger you the moment this began.</p>

        <p>The people if the UK have long been domesticated. The laws about Guns, Knives and Self-Defence seem absurd to anyone in the New World. </p>
<p>But it makes sense because all of this started in the UK. Subjects instead of Citizens; Privileges instead of inalienable rights. </p>
<p>Canada seems like Texas compared to the UK. </p>
<p>The way the Police can enter homes in Scotland without a warrant seems diabolical to a Canadian. I bet to an American it seems utterly absurd. Those videos coming out of the UK this past year have been extremely dystopian. </p>
<p>I do agree with you in the fact that Australian Leaders are acting like evil dictators, but the Australian people are allowing this to happen. </p>
<p>I have little doubt that if Australians do not stand up united immediately, they will end up in Civil War. </p>
<p>Morrison has got to go. </p>
<p>Besides he is a fucking Free Mason Globalist.</p>

        <p>Unless you live in the UK I don’t think you know how things are here at all. Not sure what’s going on in Scotland but in England you cannot enter a home without a warrant from a judge, we don’t have to wear masks, the vaccine is not being mandated (yet), and the law on self isolation is now a personal choice. All at least for the moment. We are pretty much carrying on as normal. The problem is the media make it seem dystopian but the majority of people here don’t give a shit, most succumbed to the vaccines but two tier society behaviour is minor. </p>
<p>Weapons are not so great either when it’s your children in schools being shot at….I think I’ll stay here.</p>

        <p>I am actually a duel Irish Canadian Citizen and have spent a considerable amount of time in the UK to get an Idea of the temperament of the people. And my opinion is that the people of Scotland are far more Authoritarian and Socialist than those in England. And most of the Dystopian and crazy things that happen seem to be coming from Scotland. Things like people getting charged for hate speech because of jokes seems to be common there. Its been Orwellian there for some time. </p>
<p>But the UK on the whole has been travelling down the road of Censorship, Woke Supremacy and Racial Division for a long time.</p>
<p>Boris is even making a new law that removes a Journalists protection from publishing information that the Government deems sensitive. Basically British Journalists will be arrested for espionage if the print anything from say, wiki-leaks or anything else the “Government decides is illegal.”</p>
<p>My point is that the People of the UK have long been accustomed to doing what they are told by the Government. They are more compliant so they haven’t  found it as necessary to stomp on citizens rights as often because people follow directions more readily. </p>
<p>For example: in Australia only 14% of the population has had the vaccination. Australians on the whole haven’t been doing what the Government wants and the Government is getting angry and militant. Australians rebellious nature hasn’t been bred out, yet.</p>
<p>School shootings is a strawman argument Left leaning Governments use to scare their citizens into giving up their only means of self defence. </p>
<p>Sweden seems to be doing alright with all their guns. </p>
<p>As far as weapons go there are no schools being shot at in Canada and the only people breaking the law are gangs of new immigrants. And those poor people in those communities are being left alone to deal with it because of Woke Leftists that refuse to admit that they are the ones causing the violence. So because they refuse to acknowledge it for political reasons innocent citizens are getting hurt while the woke elite pat each other on the back for not being racist. </p>
<p>Canada is a pretty wild place. I have black bears in my backyard. And hunting and guns are both necessary and commonplace. There are literally more people with guns than playing hockey. </p>
<p>Gun violence is caused by poor mental healthcare and Government incompetence.</p>
<p>Canada is has been going down the same road as Australia but its not as easy to disarm Canadians because many literally need protection from large animals. And the simple fact that it has a border that is easily walked across to the USA makes removing firearms a fools errand.</p>
<p>Canada has some serious troubles coming down the road. Censorship bills and unchecked Government power and Control Media will make Canada very uncomfortable for true Liberals and Libertarians.</p>

<p>Different size populations but 31 guns per 100 citizens there to 88 guns per 100 citizens in the US is not a great comparison. Also in terms of violent crimes with guns the numbers.</p>
<p>Violent crime &rt; Murder rate &rt; Guns &rt; Per 100k People</p>
<p>Sweden: Ranked 61st.</p>
<p>USA: Ranked 9th.</p>
<p>143 times more death per 100k people than Sweden.....quite a lot more death.</p>
<p>I think I will stick with not having a gun but each to their own thankfully we both still live in a free country, at least for the moment.</p>

        <p>Did you conveniently ignore the fact that I live in Canada and we have upwards of 12 million citizens and with handguns, semiautomatic rifles and some even have fully automatic machine guns and we do not have any of the same issues that the USA has?</p>
<p>Also the actual rates of homicide in the USA are not much different than than any other Western Nation. Only they use guns instead of knives or sticks or boots. </p>
<p>Its easy to cherry pick data to make a point especially if one only takes the low hanging fruit. </p>
<p>In Mexico the public are not allowed firearms. Its a very rare occurrence but their homicide rates are sky-high and teachers, journalists and students regularly get murdered. Heads are chopped off and bodies are quite literally hung from bridges. An entire school busload of Student disappeared and the Government never found them. </p>
<p>The Government cannot control the Gangs and Cartels that are running around with full automatic rifles, but they certainly make sure all the farmers and peasants are unable to defend themselves. </p>
<p>All crime in a society is caused by Government corruption or incompetence. </p>
<p>Either a Government fears their citizens or the citizens fear their Government. I don’t fear my neighbours with guns in Canada but I do fear my Government.</p>

        <p>The biggest secret this government has kept is that Australians have pretty much no 'inalienable' rights. </p>
<p>For the few we do have in the Constitution, the Federal Government has no desire what so ever to even attempt defending them and the High Court in its typical activitist nature concocts opinions on the Constitution that have never existed.</p>

        <p>I made a comment some time ago, asking basically, "now that they have taken your means to defends yourselves, how does it feel?" And I got downvoted in oblivion. I would wish to see what those people are saying now with the military on the streets in Australia. We tried to warn you, don't let them take your firearms away, and now look.</p>
<p>There's a guy, Larken Rose, and he did a expose on the question, "When should you shoot a cop?" And he made a very interesting point, observe the people who are being put into cattle carts, watch who is doing it and notice the difference.</p>
<p>What bothers me most is that these soldiers, and police are enforcing what they call the law; keep this in mind because it is important. They're just following orders. Now, didn't Australians, Canadians and British fight a war to stop, and prevent that kind of tyranny being forced on cultures, and people they knew very little about? The Nuremberg Trials exposed this concept or "Superior Orders." So I ask the people of the Australian military and police, what are you doing enforcing fascism?</p>
