    <strong>Over a year into this and I got my first half-asses heckling</strong>
    <p><p>If I can avoid masks I do but where I don’t have a choice I will just to avoid the BS. I never wear it at my apartment complex unless I have to walk into the main office. </p>
<p>Anyway just a little while ago I was home from work but had to run downstairs to get the mail. Heading back up, there was a woman getting in the elevator at the same time. Didn’t think much of it till she pulled her mask out of her grocery bag (the complex has a small food store inside). </p>
<p>I rolled my eyes (her back was turned). She took to one corner of the elevator I took to the opposite one (which is like, max 3 feet), and was looking at my mail. I got off a floor before her and as I’m walking away “you should really be wearing a mask...” I cut her off and told her I didn’t wanna hear it as I kept walking. She kept saying something else I cut her off again said I don’t care have a good night. </p>
<p>I think the elevator door closed at that point so that’s where it ended but...sheesh over a year into this bullshit and people are still like this?</p></p>

        <p>This is exactly why I think there are going to be some people that are so mentally damaged from this they're not going to stop this even when we get the go-ahead. I am in New York but I heard that there are people in Texas that are still doing this even though they don't have to anymore. I think there are going to be some people who are never going to feel comfortable breathing air again around other humans. They have been completely fucked up mentally and this is not going to go away for them. It's going to be hard on the rest of us as well.</p>

        <p>I’m in Miami and people are like that all over. I see way too many people alone in the car with a mask, on a motorcycle with no helmet but a mask, and people alone outside walking with and without pets also with a mask. It’s pathetic</p>

        <p>OMG I thought Florida was freedom? I guess it's the curse of a city. I never thought about it before until this whole event but cities are shitholes and I've lived in one for a very long time. I've also lived outside of a city but as a single woman with no family living in a city is more interesting for me. I'm guess I'm going to have to rethink this because I cannot stand being around these people Everyone is insane and they're driving it into the ground. I was thinking of where I might go and I realized that there is not a single Republican or conservative city in the country. Every city is loaded with Democrats that ruin everything. And I feel no affiliation with any particular political party so it has nothing to do with that but I can't live around people that ruin everything and this is the way it's trending.</p>

        <p>People keep saying Florida is free because there’s no state orders but local municipalities are still free to do what they want short of fining/arresting individuals for no masks but they can still target businesses. Mostly north/north west FL is actually open.</p>

        <p>I think Texas has the same situation going on. It feels like we are never going to come out of this bullshit. Even when people get the clear they're still reluctant to live as normal human beings. We need to put something in the water to reprogram these people back to normal humans.</p>

        <p>Yea I know the state order was lifted but I was going thru the Texas sub (I lived in Dallas for a few years), and everyone is basically saying the governor is an idiot and everyone’s still voluntarily wearing masks. It’s gonna have to go back to where people didn’t fucking let you in or provide service if they couldn’t see your face. </p>
<p>Remember when it was illegal to go into a bank with a face covering?</p>

        <p>LOL at the Pepperidge Farm comment! I actually saw a photo of a gun shop with a sign in the door that said masks are illegal in this store they are for criminals I think you are right we are absolutely going to have to Outlaw masks for people to stop this. And I don't see that ever happening</p>

        <p>As much as some people don’t wanna the only other option is to ostracize them like they’ve been doing to us. I know some don’t like retaliatory actions but I don’t see another way.</p>
