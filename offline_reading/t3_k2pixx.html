    <strong>My son's school is requiring testing to open- feeling conflicted</strong>
    <p><p>Background: I am in Western NY, and my son (10, 4th grade) goes to a private school that was open 5 days a week from Sept to last fri 11/20. There have been ZERO cases in the school. Our illustrious leader decided our county was an "orange" zone due to the "high" positivity rate which requires schools to close UNLESS 100% of students, teachers, &amp; staff get tested. Naturally, this is a huge logistical challenge, so I believe it was a way for Cuomo to shut down schools without really getting blamed for it. Because my son's school is small, they have worked very hard to get certified as a lab to perform the rapid covid test (which goes in your nose but not as far as the long swab test). I have no idea how other parents feel as I 'm not in the "in crowd" and there aren't really opportunities to discuss in person, but seeing as I am the ONLY person who does not wear a mask when I get out of my car at pickup (which is outside btw), I imagine I am in the minority. </p>
<p>I'm incredibly skeeved out at essentially being forced to have my asymptomatic son tested just so he can attend school (isn't education a right anyway?). However, his mental health has been declining greatly since he started school (there is a LOT of sanitization theater unfortunately) but he is happy to at least see his friends and talk to them.  I am trying so hard to make things as normal as possible- he had an amazing sleepover with his friends for his birthday for instance. It breaks my heart because his entire personality has been shifted- for instance every other parent teacher conference I was told how eager he was to participate in class, but this year his teacher said he is reluctant to, a marked difference. He even said at Thanksgiving he had nothing to be thankful for, he is so unhappy at school :( </p>
<p>I am also concerned because I don't want to make yet another concession. First it was "two weeks to flatten to curve". Then it was "it's just a mask" (they are required at school, even with desks 6 feet apart). Now it's "just get the test so you can go back to school". What's next? "Just get the vaccine"? Something else? At some point a line needs to be drawn.</p>
<p>There is also the issue of the high rate of false positives with the rapid test. If he DOES get a false positive, it may make things tricky. </p>
<p>Of course I will discuss this with my son- I have been very transparent with him this entire time. However, the decision ultimately rests with me as I am not sure I want to be blackmailed into a useless medical procedure so that he can go to school.</p>
<p>Sorry if that is long, I just really wanted to make sure to explain the situation clearly. </p>
<p>TLDR: feeling conflicted as my son needs to get tested to return to in person schooling.</p></p>

        <p>They are going to vaccinate them without your position. You will pick him up at school one day and he will tell you crying. You will be enraged and then it would have been too late.</p>
<p>In addition they will get him to tell all about your home (religion, economic status, guns, vaccination status) then go after you. After all, if you are unvaxxed he is at threat right? </p>
<p>Then they will take him</p>
<p>Sorry if this is depressing but look where we are. There is no end to tyranny if no one stands firm. Remember when britain first tried to appease Hitler? He just marched all over europe with no opposition.</p>

        <p>I appreciate what you are saying but that's a little outlandish to think that a small private school will hand out vaccinations. And he won't be crying over a shot because he isn't a wuss. </p>
<p>I do appreciate what you are saying, and I too am concerned about the possibility of the new normal becoming permanent.</p>

        <p>The private school will be the first to do it. Because they will bow down to the state to keep their business open. There was a link going around last week of a private school sending letters out to parents about vaccinations. At least that school had some courtesy.</p>
<p>Dont ever think that if you are paying a lot of money you are currying favors and safety. </p>
<p>There was another link on here about a state that was passing law to get consent from kids and not tell the parents they were vaxxed at school.</p>
<p>I understand you want to get your kids to school again and things 'be normal'. But thats not what the designers of this want. Their 'normal' is pushing drugs, sterlization, and harm.</p>
<p>Best you wise up that they are wolves and not be a sheep for your son's sake. After all, you are his last line of defense right?</p>

        <p>I'm not sure if that would work- the state is the one requiring the testing because of the county's status. I feel like I would be told that if I don't want my son tested that he is welcome to join the "Parallel Instruction" program that is all online. But I appreciate the response!</p>
<p>Also I wish I was bougie enough to have a lawyer haha. But I am not opposed to hiring one if necessary.</p>

        <p>You can sue the state. The test the school wants to do is wildly inaccurate and this lawsuit had worked in other places. Bring a lawsuit to them based on the inaccuracies of the pcr test and the 97% false positive rates. This is the only way you are going to win your right to send your kid to school without being subjected to medical procedures</p>

        <p>A middle ground option is to find a scanned in page of someone's test and edit it, present that.</p>
<p>We had to get our daughter tested to return to a daycare where there was an exposure, we got just the rapid test and removed the "this isn't sufficient for return to school or work" editorialising they added.</p>
<p>The problem with running this for an entire school is the false positive rate is sure to flag some, who will then need more tests, etc.</p>

        <p>Oh cool, the inaccurate PCR test with only 3% of those tested positive carrying the disease. Your son Is only 10. We'll know in a few months what their plans are. They might force you to have a vaccination proof before he can go back to school. Might aswell let him do the online classes since it's a viable alternative and reassess your options in a few months.
The test itself isn't problematic, but you're giving up your rights by going along.</p>
<p>If my son was 15 or 16 I'd maybe consider but at 10 they're not learning complicated stuff that requires a teacher to be physically present.</p>
<p>Edit: I just read your comment about your mental health, we're here for you my friend. We're all in this together and your son needs you. He's too young to lose his father to suicide. Hang on, we're slowly making a few gains against this tyranny (Madrid, Danemark, Portugal, law suites pending in Canada and US)</p>

        <p>The question of which test is tricky. The school goes from Pre-K to grade 8 so I completely understand not wanting to give 4-5 year olds the long swab test. FWIW I think their intentions were good- they were trying to get a pooled spit test but the state said no. </p>
<p>I get what you are saying regarding learning- it's not so much the subject matter for me but the social aspect. He should be able to see his friends &amp; horse around, although luckily people are now OK with playdates so online school might be less of a big deal than it was in March. </p>
<p>Thank you for the kind words regarding mental health. It's just so hard as his mom  I am supposed to be the one to have the answers for him, but I don't. Will try to keep on keeping on.</p>

        <p>I think you should just let him get tested if he wants to be back in school. It's only a test, it can't hurt him.</p>
<p>I've heard the rapid tests are only about 50 percent accurate, but it was my understanding that it would give you a false negative rather than a false positive.</p>
<p>A lot of people are telling you that your son will be forcibly vaccinated at his school without your consent, and that's just not going to happen.</p>
<p>Depending on how old your son is, you could have a discussion with him and explain that the only way he's getting back to in-person school is if he takes the test and it comes back negative. See what he wants to do.</p>

        <p>Alright things got kind of heated below, but I looked into it some more and after the initial test, 25% will be tested weekly. Considering the # of false positives this test has, that is concerning as it will certainly drive "cases" up.</p>
<p>My son and I are definitely having a discussion about this. Something in my gut is telling me this isn't right though.</p>
