        <p>I read that book in high school- probably around 2010/2011ish, and it terrified me. I was disgusted by every page but couldn‚Äôt stop reading because I knew I was looking into a crystal ball of what this world could become if left in the wrong hands.</p>

        <p>Read this in high school in 2011 and one of my friends has said ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love this place, drugs and sex all day‚Äù I was very confused at first because I felt the exact opposite. I do understand his view but I would prefer ultimate freedom.</p>

        <p>This is the really difficult thing about all of this.  About trying to argue for unmasking and reopening, about trying to argue for real car culture or gun rights, about... everything.  When people look for tyranny, they immediately look for gulags and black Volgas and constant military parades.  They're looking for the government to come out and say "You have no rights but those which we give you, so line up and march!"  But that's Tyranny v1.0, and there are only a few countries left that can really be said to operate that way, or at least there were before The Virus.</p>
<p>What we have now is Tyranny v2.0, and Tyranny v2.0 always has an excuse.  There's always a virus, or a shooting, or a car crash, or a terrorist attack, or some other Really Scary Thing to justify taking away freedom.  It doesn't relocate the Overton window all at once with brute force, it moves it slowly and subtly with beguiling promises of safety and comfort.</p>
<p>Even bloodstained Russian communism started out with what sounded like Shiny Happy goals, liberating the "oppressed workers" from evil capitalism.  The entire reason it <em>became</em> bloodstained is because, when your goal, in the simplest possible terms, is to "fix" human nature without involving God, you can't really achieve that goal by peaceful means.</p>
<p>The origin of our current theraputic tyranny lies in the decades after WWII, when it became apparent that class resentment was never going to take hold in the then-free west.  Rather than giving up or giving in, however, the supporters of Marxist ideology simply reimagined it along demographic lines, substituting black people and white people, or homosexuals and straight people, or women and men, for workers and the bourgeoisie.  The old strategy of dividing the world into "victim" and "oppressor" classes never changed.</p>

        <p>Excuse me? This is a lie. No one things that "Brave New World" is a paradise. Some people do think that moving towards that world is good however Brave New World took it way too far.</p>
<p>I have to say they are correct about that. Our capitalistic to excess world today is not a paradise. It needs some changes to move towards "Star Trek" type utopia.</p>
