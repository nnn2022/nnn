    <strong>Which vaccine would be ‘least’ dangerous for a young male?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m stuck in a situation here where my boyfriend is going to make his first vaccine appointment and I’m staunchly against them. I obviously believe in personal medical choices and if he wants to be vaccinated, there’s nothing I can do but accept it. However it worries me a lot knowing what I know, and I’d really prefer him not to have any of them if I can.</p>
<p>I’ve already talked to him about the dangers of mRNA and he seemed somewhat receptive, eventually he agreed he’d avoid vaccines using mRNA. However the other ones aren’t great either (blood clots etc.) My question is: if someone absolutely needed the vaccine for whatever reason and you had to suggest the ‘safest’ one to them, which one would you suggest? He is supportive of my choice, but still very adamant that he’ll be getting vaccinated and is scared of being ‘the odd one out.’ It would help me a lot to know that the vaccine he gets is the slightly safer choice, thank you everyone :)</p></p>

        <p>I would say Covaxin but, I do not think it is available in the U.S. unfortunately.</p>
<p>Edit: My apologies.  Not sure why I assumed you were from the US.  Being that you are from the UK, try and see if Covaxin is an option.  It uses traditional vaccine technology not mRNA.</p>

        <p>If I were getting the a vaccine for covid I would go for a vector rather than mRNA</p>
<p>Edit: I won’t take the vaccine but he’s not the odd one out if it becomes that he is seen that way this has become some sort of cult from certain parties on both sides, I believe in freedom of choice if you want it, it’s up to you, if you don’t it’s up to you. Being vaccinated or not shouldn’t distort a perception of someone it’s madness.</p>

        <p>Stay away from the mRNA ones. There is also a fear of blood clots with johnson and johnson and AstraZeneca. However, women are much more prone to blood clots than men because of their estrogen levels (especially if they are on hormonal birth control) so since he is man the risk of a blood clot for him may be lower. Something to consider.</p>

        <p>I think the AZ blood clots was a distraction <em>(it happened, but it'll also happen w/ mRNA)</em> for the trillions of spikes that the "vaccines" produce which have been shown to be "leaky" and thus spikes could plug capilaries. Not <em>always</em> causing immediate issues (like myocarditis) but a cascading effect of issues to come.</p>
<p>As your capillaries become plugged, your heart has to work harder, straining it.</p>
<p>They've also already shown that the spike proteins break the Blood Brain Barrier, and could cause neurological issues.</p>

        <p>Yes, the long term effects of free spike proteins in the blood are still unknown. Thats why I think the non mRNA ones are safer because at least then you have a finite amount of them. With the mRNA technology, who knows how many spike proteins your body will produce before it stops?</p>

        <p>Just a clarification, all the shots are mRNA. Pfizer and Moderna are mRNA inside a lipid particle. Astra and J&amp;J are the same mRNA inside a viral vector. Basically the only difference is what the mRNA is encased in to get into the cell. The only difference here is the "wrapping paper" of the mRNA. I don't know where this confusion originated from, but it's making people think they have a choice of mRNA vs non-mRNA, when really they (usually) don't.</p>

        <p>yes cov dna is encapsulated in a viral vector in the j&amp;j. what's causing the (known) issues is the spike protein itself..</p>

well this states it's a combo of delivery and spike 'mutants'<br>

        <p>How can one have faith in a "vaccine" that required definitions to add "synthetic substitues" and contains no viral material like a traditional vaccine as the "virus" was merely sequenced using SANGER sequencing machines and was never actually isolated.</p>
<p>Of course that would make sense to use assumptions considering every process along the assembly line relies heavily on assumptions.</p>
<p><strong>Case Diagnosis: U07.1/U07.2</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>assumptions = diagnostic test</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Diagnostic test (PCR)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>assumes the remainder of sequencing</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Contact Tracing (Interim-ID-01, Interim-ID-02)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>CSTE will assume all untested targets during contact tracing are asymptomatic and will be counted as a postive case</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Morbidity Statistics</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>(see above)</em> U07.1/U07.2 can be used in mortality statistics... </li>
</ul>
<p>This is the opposite of how medical errors are recorded, which is defined as the underlying cause even if it wasn't the cause of death. There is also no ICD code for medical malpractice.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR: There is not a "safe" option</strong></p>

        <p>It's a sequencing machine to fill in DNA gaps using assumptions, like in vaccines they call these assumptions a "platform approach":</p>

<p>They use a computer algorithm (w/ SANGER) to fill in gaps and basically fit together a sequence like a puzzle, it's a total guess.</p>

        <p>Why does he need to have it right this second?</p>
<p>Especially considering in the UK there are hardly any mandates at present forcing you to take it.</p>
<p>I said the same to my partner who will eventually have it, wait until the very last minute, every day there is more leaked information and soon enough something big will validate our fears.</p>

        <p>There is talk of stopping us from continuing our education without it, and he has a disabled family member so he wants to get it ASAP. I’ve asked him to at least wait a few months but he’s insistent on having it now unfortunately. </p>
<p>The restrictions are slowly being increased - from September, concerts and venues such as clubs will only be accessible to the vaccinated. I’ll have to cancel 3 concerts (that I’ve already been waiting almost 2 years to attend) because I won’t be getting vaccinated. </p>
<p>It’s terrifying, and Boris appears to be freaking out over the ‘low uptake’ of the vaccine in young people. He thinks enforcing more rules will somehow make us more likely to get it.</p>

        <p>Never going to happen even with all of the coercion they cannot afford to lose students paying the elites £9k a year not even with free pizza young people won’t take the vaccine. </p>
<p>What does being disabled have to do with Covid? </p>
<p>If he is more worried about going to a shitty night club or crappy concert than losing his arms and legs to blood clots then crack on. </p>
<p>In any case the UK government are cowards they will threaten things to scare young people into obedience, it began with passports in September, not going to work. So then they go with Deliveroo and Pizza, really not going to work. Then they threaten Education. It will go and on and on, but if they go through with any of it they will lose too much money and they know they cannot go back on it. </p>
<p>Please stop being fear-mongered into making decisions it’s been 18 months of these lies now why can people still not see it?</p>

        <p>I really hope that’s the case, I’m terrified that my rights may be threatened even further. I guess part of the fear here is that my boyfriend will buy into the attempt at segregation and treat me differently because I’m unvaccinated. </p>
<p>His family member is paralysed from the neck down, is in his 50’s, obese and has a few other health issues, so I understand his concern, but IMO it doesn’t matter if he gets vaccinated or not as he can’t see him much anyways, and even if he did give him covid then he’d be statistically likely to survive.</p>

        <p>To be honest if you have those fears already I would consider running as fast as you can in the opposite direction vaccine or not. I would die in agonising pain for my wife and take care of her through any ailment even if it killed me in the process so if he wouldn’t do the same time to say goodbye. </p>
<p>That disabled person has very little chance of survival so why would a completely healthy person put themselves at risk over somebody who is very likely going to die anyway. It’s exactly that behaviour caused by the save old people lie that got us in this situation in the first place. </p>
<p>Sounds like a hell of a lot of virtue signalling going on right there in my opinion. From experience quietly make preparations to take care of number 1, draw up a plan of what you will do if you need to move on at short notice, secure your finances, and let him do as he pleases.</p>

        <p>I’m not sure - we’ve been together slightly less than a year. I feel very strongly about him but the COVID stuff is causing issues between us. He follows the opinions of his family on this, and they are very pro vaccine and pro lockdown.</p>

        <p>No worries, you’re not intruding. They’re definitely things I need to think about. He is very passive on these things and just ‘doesn’t want to cause problems.’ He’d rather go along with what the government does and it’s a bit disturbing to me. </p>
