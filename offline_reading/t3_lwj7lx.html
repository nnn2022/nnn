    <strong>So it appears "The great reopening " has started. How far down the line before doomers switch sides and become outraged that so many people complied with lock downs and restrictions?</strong>
    <p><p>Big news in TX and MS seeming to be lifting lock downs and mask mandates and want to return to business as usual prior to this virus nonsense. I think is going to start a trend and we will be seeing more and more states drop covid restrictions and masks mandates and opting to opening back up in the coming months.</p>
<p>How long do you think it will take for the doomers to switch sides and admit the lock downs were nonsense and should have never have happened? I'm gonna guess 4-5 months from now they will have wised up and will be more open to admit they were fooled into thinking lock downs were needed.</p>
<p>Bonus: How long do you think it will be before the main stream media jumps on the "lock downs were bs" bandwagon as well? You know they will once it becomes trending. My guess is around late November when people like fauci ( if he isn't fired) will be trying to drum up another panic. And the media will spit in his face and Im figuring he will be one of the few people involved in this that gets thrown under the bus and blamed . ( which i agree with he needs to be held accountable)</p></p>

        <p>I didn’t say open states would. I live in MA and I’m telling you they’re very angry at these “Trump supporting racist nazis who are causing the pandemic to continue because they refuse to wear a mask.” It’s always the far left fueling the fire.</p>

        <p>I seriously doubt that Fauci, the media, and doomers will have the guts to admit they were wrong. I think this will end with the narrative that Biden saved America.</p>
<p>Today Biden said there will be enough vaccine to everyone by the end of May. Look at r/coronavirus, everyone is talking about the great summer that’s about to happen, with parties, concerts and movies. Just a few weeks ago that sub was talking about how it would be until 2022/23 until normalcy returned because of “Trump’s botched response.”</p>
<p>There’s a big narrative shift happening, and ultimately it’s just going to be about how Biden and the Democrats ended this pandemic. They just want credit for returning the freedoms they stole from us.</p>

        <p>Oh facui will never admit he was wrong. But his career is likely very over with once the nation is opened up. He might not get fired but they will likely never give him a platform from which to speak again.</p>
<p>The media will not admit to any wrongdoing in their fear mongering. But they will leave the covid panic agenda when the " lock downs were wrong" agenda gets them more clicks. Yeah of course they will tout Biden as the savior of mankind. But they will still end up condemning lock downs due to social pressure and what is trending. As they always have.</p>

        <p>“Doomers” or otherwise really all far left people are just the ant-minions of the media.  It’s not the doomers that are going to switch sides or be outraged.  The doomers will just wait and see for how the MSM tells them to react, and then they will react that way.  What WOULD be really interesting would be if the MSM were switched off for the next 2 months.  Then you’d for the first time in this last year have the majority of people actually forced to just use their own critical thinking.  This page would subsequently probably grow to one of the biggest pages online.  But that’s just a fantasy.</p>

        <p>&rt; I’d rather have them switch sides and end this</p>
<p>Me, too.  It will have the added bonus of being able to pull their punk cards whenever we want and they won't be able to do anything about it because they'll know the truth.  There's too much evidence, since they have to post a picture of themselves in a mask whenever they're able.  </p>
<p>When they say, "I was against all this from the beginning." just fire open their Faceberg and say, "Really?  Then who's the faggot in this picture camping with a mask on?  Isn't that you?  It looks like you; that's even your autographed 'Hillary for President' t-shirt."</p>
