    <strong>We are being oppressed</strong>
    <p><p>People everyday are threatened at gun point to wear a mask (which is more dangerous than wearing nothing). Men and women alike are punished with beatings and even death for going outside. This isnâ€™t liberty. Patriotism and freedom are slowly leaving American ideals. Itâ€™s time for another revolt.</p></p>

        <p>Can you point me to multiple stories of physical harm, up to death, for people refusing to wear a mask in the US ? Genuine question. </p>
<p>The only real case I remember of it causing death is the whacko who killed a dollar store employee for trying to enforce the masks (pretty sure he killed the man in front of his - the shooters - wife and kids too).</p>
<p>I do know of tons of verbal harassment and intimidation as well as arrests (which are wrongful as well) but nothing of physical assault or murder.</p>

        <p>I did see one video that included physical assault (dude was eating something outside, this couple <em>approached</em> him to yell at him about not wearing a mask, then initiated physical aggression; he responded in kind and they had a nice whinge about how unfair it was). Itâ€™s possible I saw one more violent that occurred in a pizza place? </p>
<p>But other than that, just non-violent assholery.</p>

        <p>Imagine being so afraid of a person without a mask on because of their breathing droplets that you approach them inside their six foot safety net to tell them how irresponsible and dangerous they are. They can't make it make sense !</p>
<p>I've had mostly rude looks here in my small town but one woman I've run into twice about town said something rude about me to another customer within my obvious earshot ðŸ™„ the first time I ignored it completely, the second time I laughed as she invaded my six foot safety net to pass me with a scowl.
It mostly angers me because both times I was with my young kids who shouldn't be made to feel they're doing something wrong for existing. Thankfully neither time they were paying attention.</p>

        <p>Iâ€™m incredibly worried about the consequences of all this madness on children. Weâ€™re teaching them that their very existence is a threat to other humans, and vice versa. I donâ€™t have children but Iâ€™m so concerned about the kids who have doomers for parents. I donâ€™t see how a child can internalize that message and <em>not</em> be permanently screwed up. :(</p>

        <p>Oppressed?</p>
<p>This is the opening salvo in a global democide.</p>
<p>(Please persuade me I'm wrong.)</p>
<p>The scamdemic hinges on the government and public believing falsely that the PCR test can detect infections.   It cannot.  It magnifies proteins left behind by previous coronavirus infections - like the cold, common flu - but cannot discern between dead fragments and active quasi-organisms like, supposedly, the supposed COVID-19 virus.  Thus, it cannot discern a contagious infection from the remnants of a previous infection.   They say it has a 90 percent rate of false positives.   I suggest that is like a stopped watch being right twice a day.</p>
<p>The false pandemic narrative seems supported by a mainstream media wholly owned by a very few members of the billionaire predator class, and a corrupted medical establishment, controlled since the 30s by the family of the original snake oil salesman, John D. Rockefeller.  That clan is no fan of humanity.</p>
<p>If anyone is interested I'll gladly link to sources.</p>
<p>This may seem like the end of the world.  I think the Cabal is failing at last.  This is the beginning of something wonderful.  We are the butterfly bursting from the cocoon of history.</p>
