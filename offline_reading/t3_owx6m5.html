    <strong>99% of COVID deaths are unvaccinated people.</strong>
    <p><p>Now, I wonder what's the percentage of people who are unvaccinated and haven't died from covid. That would be a more boring statistic, I imagine. </p>
<p>Most people only remember or care about the scary statistics. It's literally your survival instinct. They don't realize that the information age has allowed people to be consumed by their addiction to fear, and that the smart ones know how to profit off of that fear. And boy is it profitable. Do you really think nobody has found a way to profit off of telling us that Iraq has WMDs, or that Muslims are inherently evil, or that pedophiles are lurking in every street corner, or that Jews made us lose WWI, or that your daughter is a heretic? Or God forbid, that skateboarders will lower your property value?</p>
<p>This subreddit might be a circlejerk, but I haven't heard of any of these pro vaxxers being disowned by their families or being denied basic services for being vaccinated or wearing a mask. They chose the easy way, and surprise! The easy way doesn't require much thinking or going against societal norms. It's just the default state. </p>
<p>But the default state has led us into many awful predicaments, as history has shown us repeatedly. We can be pretty stupid and cruel creatures when we find ourselves being manipulated by authoritative figures. Normally, we'd laugh them and their silly ideas, but sometimes they do succeed and they trickle down their ideas until their reach your family members and your neighbors, and that's when most people choose to be conformists even when they're wrong. </p>
<p>I thought that after authoritative regimes being documented so well, that most citizens of developed countries would know what they're getting themselves into, but the fascists and the communists never went away. They just learned from their mistakes and go under a different name. </p>
<p>What, did we think the Baby Boomer era would never end and that freedom would always rule the world? Technology is always evolving, and we weren't ready for "fact checkers", a new weapon of authoritarianism that will have a negative connotation to our great grandkids not too dissimilar to the negative connotation "propaganda" has for us today. We have a long way to go. </p>
<p>Rant over. We're on the right side of history. Whether vaccines turn out to be effective or not, don't ever fucking forget that you took a stand against cowards and establishment shills.</p>
<p>edit: Source: My ass. </p>
<p>The only reason I used a clickbait title is because I saw the same claim by a random neckbeard on this sub, and it scared me until I realized it's a pointless statistic touted to scare peopleâ€” true or not. </p>
<p>Assuming that 99% of deaths are unvaccinated, what percent of unvaccinated end up dead? </p>
<p>Until I see all of my unvaccinated friends start dropping dead, I couldn't give two shits about what new scary statistic comes out. 99% of deaths being unvaccinated doesn't prove anything other than "the vaccine seems to prevent death from covid <em>for now</em> if you're prone to dying from covid in the first place.

        <p>These are lies. The vaccinated are obese and sit in doors jerking off most the time. There are studies where obese and people who have low vitamin  D are vulnerable to covid. Also wearing masks weakens your immune system.  I could go on for days how your way of thinking is stupido gringo.</p>

<p>All of these companies have played a role in the pandemic.
I find some extremely alarming in that they appear to have benefited GREATLY from it over the course of the last year and a half.
ALL of these corporations should be investigated for conflict of interest. 
Does the CDC have a board of non-affiliated citizens to audit their funding? 
Where is the oversight? 
Is it an internal committee?
That in and of itself is a conflict of interest. </p>

        <p>Well it's not even about looking it up, imo, because even though you can find proof, you really shouldn't have to if you understand the concept of getting a favor in return for money. </p>
<p>I mean shit in elementary school you learn to become friends with the kids that give you free gum. And to somehow believe that that doesn't happen on a global scale by the most powerful people on earth just makes me think that humanity as a whole is just missing an entire puzzle piece from their heads.

        <p>This statistic is bullshit based on biased methodology, but let's assume it's true for a sec.</p>
<p>Covidians now have no reason to freak out at unvaccinated people since only 1% of COVID deaths are among the vaccinated so unvaccinated people are a danger only to themselves.</p>

        <p>It's not even true. 99% of the people <em>listed</em> as COVID deaths are unvaccinated, because they're tested much more aggressively with a lower standard on the tests, and counted as a COVID death with a positive result regardless of what actually killed them. The COVID death numbers for vaccinated people are probably correct, at least the right order of magnitude; for the unvaccinated they're heavily inflated.</p>
