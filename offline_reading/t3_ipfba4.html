    <p><p>It's about 15-20 teens and no, I'm not afraid to be in a room with them for a few hours, but I'm required by law to wear a mask. I'm looking forward to seeing them and hoping to instill in them some critical thinking skills and some confidence to speak their opinions, even if they run contrary to my own, their peers, or society at large.</p></p>

        <p>Depends what the people above you are like, if they exist. One big problem with the hysteria is it doesn't take kindly to dissenting opinions.</p>

        <p>Emphasize that some risk, even risk of death, is worth taking to have a fulfilling and rewarding life. Encourage them to weigh the risks and costs of doing something (buying a product, working a job, doing a sport, etc.) versus the reward, rather than having a hysterical single focus on particular aspects; that will serve them well throughout life. Challenge the notion that personal relationships are morally suspect, abusive, difficult, or hard to navigate without mediation and supervision by inhuman bureaucratic institutions. Above all challenge the prevalent notions that safety, security, and stability is the highest goal of human existence and that man is defined by his vulnerability and helplessness rather than his heroic strength and accomplishments.</p>

        <p>Discuss the data, pull up the dashboard for your area and show them what it says about risk by age group.  Show them the flu surveillance data for your area or from the CDC let them see how it compares.  They will discover on their own that this is a scam after learning about the actual data.</p>

        <p>Emphasize the importance and inevitability of getting back to normal. Have them expect it and excited for it. Give them hope. Then, if for some diabolical reason when a vaccine arrives and cases go down and we're still not seeing mask mandates drop and everything opening up, they'll wonder why the fuck not. Then boom, more people for our cause to ensure we do get back to normal, no matter what</p>

        <p>I’d take the opportunity to help them learn how to think critically about what they see and hear - that way you are not pushing an agenda at all while giving them the basic tools they need to properly analyze shit for themselves. </p>
<p>For example, you can pull up an article on long-term effects. Many of them rely on anecdotal evidence and/or weak studies. Read the article first, ask what conclusion they draw from it and why. </p>
<p>Then: 
- look at the cited study: peer reviewed? Sample size? Sample demographics? What exactly was measured/reported? Does the study support the conclusion from the article or a more limited conclusion? </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>anecdotes: what exactly is discussed? What real details are provided (eg numbers of cases vs “we’re seeing cases”) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>context: so the article says covid causes X - is that weird or normal? Look at other viruses - do they cause the same type of damage? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>limitations: what additional info would we need in order for this conclusion to be properly supported (eg frequency data of certain damage, frequency data relative to other viruses) </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With most articles on long term damage, you’ll find that the conclusion the article promotes is that it is a common serious problem that people should be worried about. </p>
<p>After going through the evidence, including context (comps to other viruses) you will (at least with all articles I’ve seen) conclude that the evidence available supports a <em>much</em> more limited claim, closer to “this can happen but there’s no basis to conclude it is anything other than rare.” </p>
<p>This context aspect is important on another aspect. People talk about covid deaths as though death isn’t a normal thing - run through how many people die each day globally/per city/country, etc. </p>
<p>Or as though COVID is the only cause of death that matters - with reference to lockdown rules in your area (or in another, just pick a location and identify the various restrictions that have been mandated), have a brainstorming session about all the different ways the restrictions themselves could cause harm - things like the impact of fear (untreated strokes, depression, suicides, drug use, etc), direct consequences of restrictions (cancers going undiagnosed, small businesses failing, children missing school, etc), and then longer term consequences (eg professional pilot loses job and has financial help now but where does he go from here; impacts on food supply chains/poor countries). If they get stuck, make up hypothetical people from different backgrounds and ask how they specifically might be impacted. </p>
<p><strong>I would absolutely AVOID any comment directly on whether or not you agree with lockdowns.</strong> </p>
<p>Keep your opinion out of it - that’s a good way to get in trouble <em>and</em> if they’ve bought into doomer crap, it’s a great way to get them to tune you out. Not to mention that the current love of discouraging independent thought in favor of just believing what other people think is absolutely disgusting. </p>
<p>By structuring these as opinion-free critical thinking exercises, you can teach them the most important thing (how to think and reason) without stepping on any toes ... and the information itself should lead some of them to <em>independently</em> conclude that the lockdowns are excessively harmful. </p>
<p>As far as giving them hope of getting back to living, you can sprinkle in comments about your own activities, like mentioning that you go to the gym or went out to dinner, that imply you are not afraid of dying and don’t believe people should be locked at home.</p>
