        <p>Its not about the source, but the data. Most of us here are basing our hesitancy off the CDC data. So its not that we don't trust the CDC as a source. Like the Pfizer data reported by the CDC in the EUA clearly states transmission reduction was not evaluated. So when someone some tells me I should get vaxxed to protect others, I point out that the CDC says the Pfizer data does not say that is an approved use for the vaccine. There may be other studies that suggest it, but drugs only get approved based on clinical trial data. I wouldn't take a drug just because some study suggests something; I need to see it work in clinical trials first. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The same with vaccine-enhanced disease. Pfizer's data say that long-term vaccine enhanced disease risk is unknown. So when someone tells me that the vaccine has no risk of long-term vaccine enhanced disease, I tell them to fuck off. Pfizer says they simply don't know yet. And as that is a side effect I am very concerned about, I don't feel I can give informed consent until that question is settled.</p>

        <p>I don't know much about AZ at all. Yes, its true of Moderna right now, though in March they begun a seperate phase 3 clinical trial that does study transmission. Moderna will actually probably seek to get their vaccine approved for transmission reduction, whereas Pfizer seems fine with that not being on their label.</p>

        <p>Yes.  I'm open to new information.</p>
<p>New information that would challenge my views would be a true vaccine that actually stops the disease.  Then people being allowed to choose whether to get vaccinated or not and everything going back to normal.  Then I might believe that the disease is what they say it is.</p>

<p>&rt; Almost all (more than 9 in 10) COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths have occurred among people who are unvaccinated or not yet fully vaccinated, in those states reporting breakthrough data (see Figure 2).
The reported share of COVID-19 cases among those not fully vaccinated ranged from 94.1% in Arizona to 99.85% Connecticut.
The share of hospitalizations among those with COVID-19 who are not fully vaccinated ranged from in 95.02% in Alaska to 99.93% in New Jersey. (Note: Hospitalization may or may not have been due to COVID-19.)
The share of deaths among people with COVID-19 who are not fully vaccinated ranged from to 96.91% in Montana to 99.91% in New Jersey. (Note: Deaths may or may not have been due to COVID-19.)</p>

        <p>That study is worthless.  You have to be smart enough to interpret the data if your going to delve into reading studies.</p>
<p>People aren't concerned about the vaccines effectiveness against the early strains it was developed for.  The issue is that its a non sterilizing vaccine being pushed during an outbreak.  Exactly the situation that has been cautioned against by virologists for decades.  It forces a faster mutation that evades the vaccine.  Then if you are vaccinated you are left with no protection and possible ADE or long term side effects that are typically screened during phase III trials.  Trials conveniently skipped for these vaccines.</p>
<p>Back to this study.  Most of the unvaccinated numbers come from times during the big waves earlier this year, when very few people were vaccinated.  Furthermore it was against early strains.</p>
<p>Delta strain data is just starting to come in over the last few weeks and its clear from UK, US and Israel data that the vaccine is not effective.</p>

        <p>&rt;Why is it important to you for people to have a choice about taking the vaccine?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Because no vaccine is perfect, and this one has a long list of side-effects including death. It is unethical now, and always has been, to forcefully medicate someone with a drug that can harm them. Making it even worse, there is no legal recourse for the harm. If I take the vaccine and end up with a rare side-effect that leaves me permanently disabled, Congress has blocked me from suing my doctor or the manufacturer.</p>

        <p>How is taking this vaccine benefitting society, when you can still catch and transmit the virus even if you're vaccinated? I've heard many say so we can stop the variants from forming. Nope, we will never reach 100% vaccination, so even IF the variants only formed in the unvaxxed, we will never be able to irradicate them completely.  Why do you think we have so many different strains of the flu? The flu vaccine, every year, is just an educated guess on which strains will be most prominent. And you want to convince me that this covid vaccine protects me, when even 76 years of research and production of flu vaccines have happened, and we STILL haven't figured out a way to protect us against all the flu strains?  How can I trust these vaccines when we don't know the long term side effects and those sounding the alarm bells and those trying to tell their stories of severe side effects after the jab, are being muzzled? Deaths due to the vaccine aren't bring reported either.  Take a look at history, these companies have faced major lawsuits over the years, countless lives we're lost or ruined from severe injuries after certain vaccines/medications. Many weren't discovered for YEARS. And these "medicines" underwent studies, trials, rigorous testing, and through proper approvals. These new vaccines have gone through none of that..  have severe allergies to a lot of medications, and had a bad reaction to the pneumonia vaccine 2 years ago. I am not taking this vaccine until more unbiased research has been conducted. We deserve to have ALL the facts, ALL the data to make an informed decision on what is best for OUR body.</p>

This is not a anti vax movement this is a pro freedom movement. You can lean into specific ideals and stances on topics while still leaving room for skepticism. You are mistaking what this group is.

<p>Considering that the constitution was written well over 100 years ago you could argue that it is severely outdated. And how do you know that the founding fathers weren't corrupt and wrote the constitution to benefit themselves</p>

        <p>It's not outdated lol. It was written as a guide to preserve liberty. Inalienable rights. We only got in this position because the blatant disregard of those rights. The founding fathers understood history and history repeats itself. If it didn't we wouldn't be here having this conversation. Did you seriously just say over 100 years ago?? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 you're not American are you??</p>

        <p>I'm pretty open minded, but it really depends on the issue. </p>
<p>For example: My views on the vaccine have been pretty dynamic, as new data/research comes out. While my views on lockdowns will not change.</p>
<p>The things that usually convince me are historical allusions, clear transparent data, peer reviewed research, comparing two opposing biases, and personal/second hand experience. </p>
<p>The views that I will not change, are generally more of a moral opposition, and it's hard to apply data and science to something of that nature.</p>

        <p>Im sorry. But after watching this whole charade, i will never trust a vaccine' for me or any dog i ever own again.  And i will influence anyone in my life, and educate them about the dangers of said "vaccines".</p>
<p>From the flip flopping, to the shaming, the insults and cries for segregation, and bribery, all of it.  Im done with any vaccines.</p>
<p>So i hope these people across reddit, realize their insults have caused even more vaccine hesitancy.  Its well past that.  No way im ever taking any preventive vaccine again. Nor is my best friend.</p>

        <p>None.  The statistics and data through this whole thing have been manipulated, censored, altered etc.  Who actually decides its %100 effective?  The same people who are selling the precious"vaccine", thats who.  And if the data isnt from them themselves, it is passed to orginizations, scientists, that those that big pharma pays grants to, etc.  And they manipulate how that data is presented. Conveniently ommitting and adding data as they see fit.</p>
<p>As i said.  Im not playing this game, and i never will.</p>
<p>Makes me wonder why dogs cant live past 8 years and their deaths are usually because they are riddled with cancer.  Makes you wonder wtf they are injecting us all with. Ever see the list of vaccines a dog takes?  Its gross.</p>

        <p>I dont need data. Im over 50 and have lived it by having two dogs beside me through those 50 years. I have witnessed first hand, what these "vaxxens" accomplish.  Again people like you call for data that is made by the same people who manufacture and SELL the cure. If you cant wrap your head around that, im at a loss.</p>
<p>My dog doesnt need rabies vaccine" for a disease he has less than %1 of catching, for unknown injections that in most probability, have a higher chance to give him cancer.</p>
<p>And yes, certainly some animals and people will not be harmed by these fucking experiments. The same way people cry "safe and effective" and others are instantly clotting.</p>
<p>Your call for data is naiive, as naiive as asking the used car salesman for the cars history.  He will tell you what he needs to, to sell that car. Vaccine is no different. I suggest you understand this.</p>
<p>Its a fallacy for you to even trust any "data" at this point. If you cant see your playing a game idk what to tell you.  You call for data'? data like cdc saying wear masks? Dont wear masks? Back and forth?  Or the faulty pcr tests data?  Im sure first hand accounts hold more weight.</p>

<li>Stop the sleezy car-salesman hard sell that makes you think you're being sold a lemon</li>
<li>Honestly answer the claims skeptics make instead of utilizing big tech to silence them (and come out openly and say big tech needs to stop doing so. Maybe even create a social media bill of rights eh?)</li>
<li>Be willing to admit they're wrong about some things, and stand behind and prove the ones they're right about (like for example honestly evaluate how the counting of deaths and cases has proceeded for 18 months)</li>
<li>Abandon the absolutism of "everyone must be vaccinated" when that has never, ever been advised for any other vaccine, because that feeds back into #1</li>
<li>In general, a balanced view would get me to actually pay some attention to what they are saying. Right now, I see no balance and it simply convinces me this is an authoritarian power grab.</li>

        <p>Oh hell yes. I'd love to be wrong about the vaccine and find out that it's been thoroughly tested over long term studies and does everything it originally was supposed to do with negligible side effects and no hidden illnesses.</p>

        <p>They could start by isolating the virus and then proving it's communicable and causes disease. </p>
<p>After that, I might be open to anything.</p>
<p>In other words, I might actually trust the science if any science ever became involved with the "pandemic".</p>

        <p>I am always open to information.  Its not so much the source as much as the data when it comes to things like studies.  I mean of course the funding is a concern but the data shows what it shows.</p>
<p>The problem with these vaccines are that they haven't gone through normal trials for full approval.  It takes years.  Anything less than this at this point is not to be trusted.  They have no idea about the long term consequences about this new type of vaccine because they simply haven't had the time required to know.  Its really that simple.</p>
<p>With any type of disease you have to weigh the risk of infection against the risk of the cure.  Covid19 is extremely low risk for healthy people under 65.  The vaccine risks are unknown.  Its a new tech that has failed to ever get approved.  Its not helping that they are suppressing possible bad reactions, in fact its hurting their case.</p>
<p>Now if I was faced with a virus that was killing 25% and highly contagious, I would be willing to accept a lot of risk on the vaccine end of things.</p>
