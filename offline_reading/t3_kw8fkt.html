    <strong>Anyone else afraid that things will never actually go back to normal?</strong>
    <p><p>New lockdowns announced in Ontario today. Yay.</p>
<p>It's not even the lockdowns that bother me anymore (I just choose to ignore them anyways). What bothers me is the people either praising the lockdowns, or even worse, begging for stricter ones. I know Canadians are passive and trusting by nature but this really really scares me. I just want to shake sense into people. </p>
<p>At this rate, people have been brainwashed so much, I only see the "best case scenario" as being:
A) A Covid pass to prove you've had the vaccine. 
B) Mandatory masks during the winter season for the rest of time (since Covid is eventually just going to become something we live with like the flu). </p>
<p>That's very depressing stuff. I'm glad there's people on here to vent with though.</p></p>

        <p>I feel the same...likely will never travel again, it sucks, but I can accept that. Worried about a job too, currently in school studying to be a teacher. Definitely not ever going to take a vaccine solely for the sake of a job. Been looking online for other ways to make money.</p>

        <p>Same and I'm so depressed. Right before all this happened I had gotten to a really great place in my career and I had money saved up and time off saved up and a ton of airline points saved up. Plus I have some health issues that I finally got under control and 2020 was supposed to be the year I started traveling the world. </p>
<p>Now I'm probably never going to fly again.</p>

        <p>I see either two scenarios happening, one would be that after Sleepy Joe gets inaugurated they will dial down the PCR test and give him the credit that masks (this will be after his 100!day mask mandate) worked and the vaccines are helping, we ease lockdowns slowly and they declare that old fart a hero for saving the day, the doomers also praise Joe as a god of THE ScIenCe. The other scenario is lockdowns and this entire bullshit continues and gets worse until we're at such a dystopia we are horrified, doomers then even beg for stricker lockdowns at this point</p>

        <p>I left Ontario last June because I had already had enough of the Ford government’s handling of the situation.  I’ve since made two short trips home, but I quickly left again.  I can’t live under that dark cloud and see so many people blindly supporting everything (and begging for more!).</p>
<p>With all due respect to actual refugees, I feel like a refugee - I feel like I can’t go home until things are socially/politically different.</p>
<p>And as I’ve read elsewhere - the selfish ones are the people who think we can keep living like this.</p>

        <p>Don't worry, Biden's now president, so everything is going back to normal on inauguration day, even though he's given no indication of this. (I guess /s?)</p>
<p>I think A and B are on the way. Except B is likely going to be year-round mask wearing forever, even during the summer months. People are very much brainwashed, yes, and so many people have told me that they'd be fine living with masks and lockdowns forever, so I am not very hopeful this will go away. Not easily, anyway.</p>

        <p>Yes. It will end, as it has to; there is no tax money coming in, so Cuomo is flipping his lid. They are using the vaccine as their magical out, because they cannot admit they over-reacted and fucked up to destroy society. It is a mass hysteria, mass panic event supplied all by the CCP.</p>

        <p>If it was only the CCP behind this, we would have re-opened by now as their plan unraveled. But we have not, this is a global event with most countries in complete lockstep. The hysteria is only coming from the masses, the government leaders know what they are doing, and it is <strong>all</strong> intentional.</p>

        <p>Have you read Michael P. Senger's articles? They explain the CCP influence.</p>
<p>Mass panic, hysteria, all pushed by the CCP which funds the WHO. WHO listens to the CCP. It's very straightforward - and scary.</p>
<p>Social media has influenced the creation of this pandemic. If we didn't have social media nobody would know. Last winter my doctor thought we had a particularly bad, strange flu season where people weren't testing positive for flu...</p>

        <p>You're assuming the CCP are the only ones involved in this. They're not. It's naive to believe they are the only ones orchestrating this when essentially every major governmental leader in the world is doing lockdowns, restrictions, etc. CCP is just one cog in the machine.</p>

        <p>IT WILL NEVER GO BACK TO NORMAL. People need to realize this. Stew in it for as long as it takes. The NWO is HERE and they aren’t going anywhere. They will soon come for Christians, pro ex pres supporters (I don’t believe in the left right paradigm they are two wings of the same evil bird), and even freedom loving patriots who won’t go along with the mass psy op on a global scale. The ONLY thing you can do is resist until the death of you and believe the gospel of Jesus Christ while there’s still time. We are in the end times and EVERYONE needs to understand this. Things will not get better, they will get worse and worse. Life as you know it is gone and it will never come back. If you don’t get vaccinated and eventually refuse taking the mark you will be killed, tortured, or jailed and possibly ALL 3. This is a hard reality for most people to except, but HEED these words because things are coming to a climax very soon! Get right with the Lord and put your entire faith in Him at all times til the end. Sorry if this sounds scary, but you’ve seen NOTHING yet.</p>

        <p>Specifically speaking on Ontario, I used to work for the government and am now working in private consulting for and with the government and I can ensure you this situation is a lot of typical ineptitude and typical government taking forever to move on anything meaningful regardless of political party. </p>
<p>Doug Ford is desperately trying to play a both sides game where he wants to appeal to doomers with more lockdowns and to his base by making concessions like doing a lockdown after Christmas, leaking info days before actually enacting it, and allowing so many businesses to stay open that there is no logical sense to any of it. In the end, he's making both sides more frustrated.</p>
<p>More importantly, he's being advised to do most of this because of the ICU bed capacity problem in this province. Which is a real problem every winter in many Ontario hospitals well before last year and into the previous Liberal administration.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong: none of this is right. All of this is incredibly frustrating and is taking a terrible toll on the rest of society that staying home and watching Netflix cannot fix.</p>

        <p>Luckily(ish?), this attempt at worldwide communism can't last forever because there is no productive rich society to ship us food like the US did for the USSR and China. Nothing in the world can stop the dollar from it's inevitable collapse anymore, and when it goes so will the rich western standard of living. A few rich oligarchs aren't going to be able to hang on to the reigns during the collapse of western civilization (I hope).</p>

        <p>It will go back to normal, once everyone just does what is necessary. That isn't prancing around without a mask and being careless of people by the way.</p>

        <p>Yeah I'm thinking around October it'll be back to normal where I am, in Ontario, Canada. They're on track to finish vaccinating everybody by then. I won't be wearing a mask every day once they aren't mandatory anymore. Too annoying, they fog up my glasses lol.</p>
<p>I might wear one when I go out if I'm sick though, so I don't spread it. I think that piece of Asian culture where they wear masks when sick is kind of cool. I felt like I was living in an Orwellian nightmare the first few weeks of being forced to wear a mask but I soon got over myself. I don't feel like it's a big deal anymore.</p>
