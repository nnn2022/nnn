    <strong>Reddit user calling for segregation of non-vaxed threatens me after I challenge him</strong>
    <p><p>(SOFT threat sry don't mean to be sensational)</p>
<p>This is the level of brainwashing we are dealing with unfortunately. He was actively spreading misinformation and calling for discrimination against a whole subset of the population (in a comment- this is my response since I was banned from the covid sub so could not respond there).</p>
<p>I made a calm, science based, evidence based with actual data and his response is to threaten me. I have no intention to make these people feel wrong or belittle them-- we have to remember that only love can drive out hate and honestly in their point of view, they are doing the best with what they know. They are not malicious people.   </p>
<p>They just have been brainwashed and manipulated. Don't try to argue, but DO live your truth with respect. We all have to strike a balance between this.   </p>
<p>As much as this does strike anger and fear inside of me... this is exactly how genocides and past transgressions against humanity have happened, there is only so much we can control vs leave the rest in God's hands and fate.</p>
<p>Funnily enough these are the people who are the most science-illiterate. I have a science degree from a phenomenal university. Who cares, I don't use it and degrees are useless but I am VERY well qualified to have an opinion on this matter. More than 99% of the people in the covid sub at least. I feel bad for them that they have been manipulated to live in such fear by the politicians not even respecting their own rules.</p>
<p>If worst comes to worst and we are somehow forced to pick between complete inclusion in society or no, or worse life and death somehow, then my first response will be to practice nonviolent dissent e.g. a hunger strike like how Gandhi did. I will under no circumstances be taking this vaccine, it is completely unnecessary for my *personal* risk profile but I support the right of whoever wants to take it to take it, if it may help their mindset have less fear then great. What I will NOT stand for is forced vaccination or discrimination of any kind against me.</p>
<p>Anyway be well, spread love and positivity, don't argue but DO stand up for your rights and truth, don't try to change, just hold space for humanity to awaken and trust it is happening. Hopefully I planted a seed in his mind.</p>
