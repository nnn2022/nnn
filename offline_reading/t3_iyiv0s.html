    <strong>Some covid fanatic just called me out for not wearing a mask at the local Claire's... info in text..</strong>
    <p><p>So I was going down to the local Claire's when I was STOPPED right at the entrance by some nerd who said "Do you have a mask?" I obviously responded with "no" and treid to continue into the store.</p>
<p>She stepped in front of me and said "Sorry ma'am if you don't have a mask you can't enter."</p>
<p>I was so PISSED. I immediately began projectile shitting all over her and then ran straight in while she was blinded. But I was stopped by another liberal who TAZED me for no reason!  Obviously I respect the cops #backthepurple but this was RIDICIULOUS!!!</p>
<p>What do I do???? I can't go to Claires anymore and that liberal ordered a restraining order...</p>
<p>Also in other news my grandma died RIP to her its all gods plan God bless üôè üíô ‚ù§ üò¢</p></p>
