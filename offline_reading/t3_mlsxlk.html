        <p>This has been ongoing for a while. They are combing death certificates trying to find deaths that can possibly be classified as related. This is big business. Even bigger with the $1.9 trillion bailout and special interest windfall Congress just passed, and more is probably on the way. When you subsidize something, you get more of it. Aside from bloating the overall numbers, the aggregate sites report their numbers by date reported, not date of death, so it looks like we have all these new deaths when most of them are not. They can keep going for at least several more months, thus ensuring the "pandemic" and associated fear continue.</p>

        <p>I hate how the medical sector, due to being private is so selfish and for profit. How can people's health which is their lives be related to profit! its disgusting, medicine is supposed to be the last sector into which you go into because you want to help ppl, etc but nope....and they are scamming the gov for money and the gov has no choice but to pay AND count these numbers into the covid statistics</p>

        <p>Maybe vital records review? That is what the state of Michigan does: https://www.clickondetroit.com/health/good-health/2020/07/23/why-are-additional-covid-19-deaths-added-to-michigans-state-count-after-review-of-records/</p>

        <p>I don’t think it’s intentional manipulation per se, but I also wouldn’t entirely rule out the possibly. It’s more work for the gov to track those deaths more accurately, and why would gov workers want to do more work? Check out Jennifer Cabrera on Twitter. She looks at the same thing but for Florida.</p>
