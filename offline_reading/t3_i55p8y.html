    <strong>Accuracy of Tests</strong>
    <p><p>Mike Dewine the governor of Ohio just tested negative after testing positive earlier today.</p>
<p>He was tested as is required before he was to meet with President Trump.</p>
<p>Just goes to show the accuracy of these tests, how many of the people without symptoms didn't actually have this virus.</p></p>

        <p>I went to hospital during this as I got a panic attack. I asked doctor if I could get a Covid test since I thought knowing the answer might help me calm down. She said it wasn’t worth it as it was unlikely I had it. My feelings were much more likely due to me quitting smoking. Also, at the hospital I had to wear a mask which exacerbated my panic.</p>
<p>Apparently, there’s a 30% false negative on our test in Ontario. Even if it’s negative they made people quarantine for two weeks as a result. Doc thought quarantining would be worse for me than CoVID especially if it was negative.</p>

        <p>Funny.  Here in NM we actively discredit antibody tests for being inaccurate.  We never talk about the reliability of PCR tests.</p>
<p>I asked my doctor if antibody tests were available.  I was told that they are only for people with a previous positive followed by a negative PCR test and are only good for 30 days.  After that, you no longer have antibodies and can get re-infected.  Oh, and the tests aren't great.</p>
<p>I imagine his information came directly from the bowels of our cabinet secretary.</p>
