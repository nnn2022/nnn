        <p>I messaged the mod of /r/aww and got like a wall of text describing how free speech doesn't apply to reddit.</p>
<p>I mentioned how I don't discuss anything COVID related outside of /r/NoNewNormal and /r/conspiracy and I got muted for 30 days.</p>
<p>These people are literally acting like full blown communist dictators.</p>

        <p>These things happen. Think I've been banned from 3 or so. I'm sure there are wacky people in this sub, but my experience has been people just wanting to be left alone and not be told what to do when they feel the demand is unnecessary. Wouldn't have to be bribed or derided if the average Joe felt this was serious. I know if I saw clear evidence and knew someone that died, fer sure I wouldn't have to be convinced to get vaccinated. I don't know anyone that's died or anything beyond a diagnosis, I've seen no evidence of mass burials or body burning, no crammed hospitals. I dunno. I've been living normally since day one and I haven't even gotten a cold.</p>
<p>I've had the police called on me, I've been targeted and treated like pure shit by my employer, dirty looks from randoms, I've been treated poorly in my opinion, but I have principles and integrity that I'm not retreating from, and an attitude with people that don't treat me the way I treat them. Live and let live, or die. Help those that can and want to be helped, plant seeds by giving others opinions and advice to not make the same mistakes I've made. </p>
<p>We vaccinated my son for the first year of his life, and he stayed sick on top of his congenital anomalies that continue to make his life very difficult (more info in my first posts if you're interested). I've been on two life flights with my boy, my head stays on a swivel and I'm alert 24/7 for anything that seems out of the ordinary. He's almost died in my arms. We stopped his vaccinations long before this preposterous event commandeered the lives of most people on earth, and he hasn't had the sniffles since. Absolutely, if I felt it necessary and the evidence of this vaccination being safe and beneficial were there, we'd get vaccinated. I'm not anti medicine, science or vaccinations. We have immune systems, and like any other part of our body, it needs exercise. You cannot isolate yourself and breathe in your germs all day and expect to stay healthy.</p>
