        <p>masks don't work. If you are on a bus near someone with the coof for more than 15 minutes, you will likely contract the coof. Good news is the virus is weak af and most people's immune system will beat it up and you'll be fine. Also there are a lot of treatments. The only thing the mask does is dehumanize, isolate, muffle voices, create a sensory prison, impair your breathing as a human being that needs oxygen to feed the brain, and generally make every human activity, including riding a bus, a less enjoyable and depending on duration, a suffering punishment. They don't work and the notion that everyone is potentially asymptomatic spreaders for over a year is insidious and nefarious. The masks are a perpetual lockdown for the mind. They are a reminder that we are "in a pandemic" even though we aren't. This would have been forgotten about quicker than the swine flu if it were not for the masks and constant barrage from the mockingbird media. The masks, predictably, with the mass compliance, have now led us to a state where they are conceiving vaccine passports tied to QR codes in a social credit-like system similar to the one in China. Then when everyone complies with that encroachment.... well, it only gets worse. Human beings have rights and all these insane measures, again it starts with the masks, go against the geneva conventions and nuremburg code. If you don't mind the mask, good for you, but your compliance and blas√© attitude toward them, just so you know, is contributing to a level of human suffering and continued suffering, children being masked and treated like diseased ridden animals to be muzzled and corralled, a level of human suffering that is unprecedented and immeasurable and the path we are heading down is the stuff of nightmares, the substance of the worst, most terrifying science fiction. A hellish dystopia. TLDR: Masks don't work to stop virus spread and they are a gross encroachment on sentient beings.</p>

        <p>no! because you are ignoring the fact that there are string pullers lurking in the shadows who have orchestrated this comedy for decades, or perhaps even centuries. just tell me at what point in human history all governments were on the same page and all followed the same story. even the most western and most antipatic countries adhere without batting an eyelid to the shitty guidelines of the WHO.  so to conclude, I would say that when there is a little smoke, there must necessarily be a fire somewhere.</p>

        <p>I have one question for you. Why is covid being treated differently from the flu? We constantly have flu seasons where we get reminded to wash our hands and don't lick door knobs yet no mask was ever required then? Even in situations where mask where being used they were temporary. That's the problem. Covid ain't going away. The vaccine doesn't last forever (assuming you don't die from the vaccine itself) so what happens then? You want to wear a mask and keep getting vaccinated forever? Yeah no thank you, you Yankees can keep your masks but I ain't breathing through a cloth for a cold. I've also had covid before, back before mask were even being discussed. You wanna know what it felt like? It felt like a lay in bed watching Netflix while drinking tea mixed with a little whiskey kind of sickness. That's what made me become anti-mask, I got covid and realized it ain't shit. Oh but your a healthy adult male right? Wrong bitch I got asthma and I'm overweight. But yet I didn't fall out like a dandelion in the breeze. It didn't do anything but annoy me yet we got the whole damn world shut down. You wanna explain to me how my overweight asthmatic southern body managed to survive covid yet its gonna kill every God damn person who ain't wearing a mask? Maybe I'm just so damn healthy right? Must be the cigarettes and whiskey that saved me from dying from covid.</p>

        <p>My assumption would be, that in the beginning not much was known of the virus, so there was a lot of fear of what it could be. Kind of a better safe than sorry mentality. And now we know it's really not that deadly at all, but we're already so deep in this mentality of taking it seriously that there's no going back. Kind of like how people tend to defend their beliefs once they've made up their mind, no matter what evidence is presented to them showing it's a wrong belief. </p>
<p>Thanks for your response. Glad you're doing good.</p>

        <p>No problem man I'm happy to share my experiences. I get what you mean though, but I feel like Chinas gotten a lot less blame than they deserve. I mean could you imagine China's reaction (or the rest of the world for that matter) if the US developed a new sickness that was super contagious but told no one about it, and allowed US citizens to travel the world? The US would be fucking wrecked with all sorts of back lash, yet we can't say it's china's fault because that would be racist. Man fuck it if saying China's a tumor on this planet and deserves to be wiped out makes me racist so be it. I ain't even gonna give the Chinese citizens slack, they could take back their country if they all decide it was worth it. But they are just as guilty since they refuse to stand against the communist regime. Nazi sympathizers are just as guilty as nazis so I don't see why against get a get out of jail free card on this one</p>

        <p>The mask does not work in filtering viruses, period. Remember that poster about peeing with or without trousers, and how that‚Äôs supposed to be a good illustration of masks efficacy? Easy to debunk. When someone farts with underpants and trousers on, can you smell it?</p>

        <p>The whole vaccine rush is bc of false media.  If the media was NOT hyping Covid-19 deaths and such, it would be just a normal year with a bad flu going around. </p>
<p>Why do I say that?  Well, I lived in Asia during the SARS scare and the Swine Flu scare and no one really changed behavior much beyond actually wearing a mask when sick to go to work.  Sick folks in Asia used to wear masks to protect others from their respiratory spray.  IDK if it's still like that now.  </p>
<p>Regardless, more deadly flu viruses have circulated in cities that were FAR more packed than the ones in the US and it's never been a cause for lock down.  </p>
<p>If you still believe this is all about the Covid-19, then you should probably dig a little deeper.  There has been nothing about the reactions to this pandemic that is normal.  And, to top it all off, pushing "test" vaccines on the general public is borderline criminal.  </p>

        <p>My son had clear rona symptoms and tested positive. (Mild symptoms lasted a total of two days) He didn't spread it to anyone at day camp even though he was there ALL DAY and he claims the symptoms started the minute he left. He didn't spread it to his Dad or Stepma, who he spent the previous weekend with and who also picked him up from said day camp, and he didn't spread it to me, who stayed with him at home for ten days. No masks. No social distancing whatsoever. No sanitation protocols LOL whatsoever. No keeping the pets separate LOL per the covid paperwork. You don't need a mask to prevent rona. Everyone I know who is obsessed with masks and bleaching everything have caught the damn rona. </p>

        <p>I largely agree with you.  In tightly packed places I think people should be wearing them right now.  It's really the cult mentality that masking has become.  They are a better safe than sorry measure not a panacea, not something to form a religion out of.  Not something that should start instilling in people this perception of others as being in a perpetually infectious state, which it has.  Like, why are people wearing them outside?  What the fuck happened since August (when mandates went in here) to now that made people voluntarily start wearing them outside?</p>
<p>I'm not on board with the sterilization narrative or other over the top stuff either regarding the vaccine.  I think the motivation behind the vaccine is nefarious to the extent that there are some huge pharmaceutical $$$$ to be made, esp. if they start saying ppl need to re-up every 6 months.  Also like you said, the gov't can say we can go back to normal now because we have the vaccine and never have to acknowledge what a stupid shit show lockdowns were to begin with.  The most worrying concern has to do with vaccine passports for domestic use and what that would usher in.  Keeping my eye on that and really hoping it never happens on a large scale.</p>
