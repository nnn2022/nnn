    <strong>Zoomers Of This Subreddit, How Has This Global Crisis Affect You, Your Family, And/Or Inner Circle?</strong>
    <p><p>I will like to hear the views of the young victims of this "Pandemic" and other Global issues. I've heard of issues like mental health and not being able to see friends. But I want to hear you guys. Please have a civil discussion.</p></p>

        <p>What are zoomers?</p>
<p>Mine has mostly been mental health and feeling incredibly sad for the people who are being affected worse than me, such as people who got their cancer treatment delayed or people's businesses being ruined or elderly in care homes being denied visits. </p>
<p>Despite the fact that I was breaking the rules and hanging out with friends, I still almost ended it all during the second lockdown in England.</p>
<p>Also feeling depressed over so many people losing their humanity and snitching on their neighbors and the fact that so many now see their fellow humans as vectors of disease they should be scared of instead of human beings. Even when things come back to the time where people didn't wear masks and weren't living in fear of a virus, I will never be the same after seeing what people have become. My faith in humanity is lost and my only comfort is that I will never bring children into this world.</p>

        <p>I think he's referring to young people as "zoomers" because that's the only interaction young individuals will get now. As opposed to going out with friends and enjoying fresh air.</p>
<p>Edit: in other words, using zoom as your only option for interaction with other people since you can't leave your house without being tackled by fully decked out covid police.</p>

        <p>Cancer treatments only get cancelled when hospitals are too overwhelmed to be able to offer the necessary standard of care, or in-hospital spread is judged to be more of a danger to these people than the delayed treatment.</p>
<p>As someone who has had hospital appointments cancelled and delayed multiple times this year, the best thing you can do for us is work to limit the spread as much as possible and stop breaking the rules. You're just making it worse for us.</p>

        <p>Here in England cancer treatments got cancelled during spring and summer when the hospitals were not even close to being overwhelmed, in fact numerous healthcare workers came out to say that they were sitting on their asses all day at work doing nothing. Due to these cancellations, the leading cancer charity here estimates over 200k people will die.</p>
<p>I will not stop breaking the rules due to the fact that there is zero evidence that a healthy person can spread a disease and due to the fact that following the rules has almost driven me to suicide previously.</p>

        <p>The ICUs were overwhelmed in England, and it wouldn't be safe for people on immunosuppressant drugs to enter hospitals if the infection rates are too high. </p>
<p>They have tried their best to keep going in England - I had an appointment delayed 6 months but eventually they figured out ways to get people in more safely and I went in when the rate was around 400/100,000 cases. It was stressful as I didn't want to get infected and I wasn't able to take someone in with me, I also had to isolate before going in. If the infection levels had been lower, the whole thing would have been a whole lot less worrying.</p>
<p>There is plenty of evidence that apparently healthy people can spread the disease. In fact, 50% of cases originally presenting as asymptomatic go on to show symptoms in a number of days, and people are infectious several days before showing symptoms. I don't understand how you're still in denial of the evidence.</p>
<p>Ignoring the rules is not noble or commendable, it serves nobody apart from yourself and makes getting care more dangerous for those of us who need it.</p>

        <p>Incorrect, ICUs were not overwhelmed during spring and summer. You need to get a grip, not even the biggest fear mongering media outlets claimed that the ICUs were overwhelmed during this time. </p>
<p>They are overwhelmed now just as they are overwhelmed every single winter due to the govt cutting NHS funding.</p>
<p>There is no evidence of this. This is being presented as fact but actually evidence and studies of healthy people spreading the disease? Nonexistent.</p>
<p>Me ignoring the rules has certainly served my friends whose mental health was in shambles due to loneliness and isolation. No one is going to put a strangers health over their own health and the health of their friends and family. This is just human nature, same way you are currently putting your own health over mine and claiming I should stay at home and become suicidal to make sure you get your cancer treatment.</p>
<p>Your treatment should be guaranteed to you by the govt, but due to them systematically ruining and defunding the NHS and then putting the cherry on top, telling hospitals to cancel treatments in spring and summer your treatment got delayed. It had fuck all to do with me going to a friend's house to have a drink. </p>
<p>I am not your enemy, your government is.</p>

        <p>I don’t know exactly what a zoomer is but I’m a teenager currently under lockdown. To be honest I am dreading my future. I have lost a lot of respect for people I used to admire. My career plans have changed a lot because industries either are dead or they’re difficult  to enter into. I would say my mental health isn’t great. I’m very bored most of the time and it feels like I’m just doing school and work with no real purpose to my life. Don’t get me wrong. There are some good moments like spending time with my family or getting to be lazy at home, but hanging out with only your family and playing video games for 10m makes you weird lol. I just don’t know what I’m going to do in the future and am taking one day at a time .</p>
