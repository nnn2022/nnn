    <strong>Those who supported the lockdowns won't admit their responsibility when the bill has to be paid. It's already happening.</strong>
    <p><p>In several countries the painful economic effects of lockdowns are becoming too obvious to ignore them anymore. </p>
<p>For example, in my country our national debt was downgraded and people blamed the government (and they are to blame for this). However, the very same people who supported this madness are shocked (or pretend to be shocked).</p>
<p>One doctor said the lockdown had to be harsher in order to "beat the virus" and have a stronger economic recovery. ðŸ™„</p>
<p>A "renowned" economist who said he would never support any policies that don't respect the human life (meaning opening businesses) is now shocked that unemployment increased and our GDP fell.</p>
<p>These people won't accept they supported the lockdowns.</p>
<p>But we need to remember. They cannot be forgiven. They can't. They need to be held accountable for this just like the people who supported the Rwandan Genocide or the Holocaust were held accountable.</p>
<p>Thanks. English is my third language so there could be grammar errors.</p></p>
