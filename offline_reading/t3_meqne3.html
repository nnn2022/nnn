    <strong>seaspiracy and covid.</strong>
    <p><p>I have just watched the new Netflix documentary called ‚Äòseaspiracy‚Äô about the overfishing and corruption in the fishing industry. Very eye opening about something I had no knowledge of. Now how does this relate to covid? Well without giving away spoilers about the documentary there is a lot of corruption and money exchanged between fishing companies (legal and illegal) and companies that put on  the ‚Äòsustainable‚Äô stickers on Tuna as well as the crowds that are all for cleaning our oceans, that in reality aren‚Äôt addressing the real pollution issue which is fishing.</p>
<p>Well this is a huge industry, kept pretty hush hush and most of the world are very unaware of this. It‚Äôs something that is happening as we speak and my boyfriend and I were shocked. Yet he and I have different views on covid and lockdowns. He like many others laugh and say ‚ÄòHow could all governments organise this whole thing?‚Äô ... ‚ÄòThey are doing their best in helping us and they care about our health‚Äô, you know all the arguments. But here we watched an hour and a half of a billion dollar industry that has governments looking the other way for profit. If they allow this to happen how would the people in power honestly care about us? They don‚Äôt! They lock us down so the big companies make money, they produce fast tracked vaccines for profit, potentially making us sick so we pay for healthcare. It‚Äôs all about profit not the greater good. If it was for the greater good, profit wouldn‚Äôt be their main driver. </p>
<p>Rant over.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah there is a recent book and I can‚Äôt think of the name, but it exposes several aspects of the supermarket and in a chapter explains that slavery is happening around the fishing industry in asia and that so+called environmental groups only make it worse ha. It makes perfect sense. Messed up.</p>

        <p>I watched it and agree 100%
If the gate keepers make money by opening the gates, why close them?</p>
<p>I also have one point related to the doc, if I may. </p>
<p>They said there is no such thing as ‚Äúsustainable fishing.‚Äù
There is one fishery in the world that does it correct. The Bristol bay sockeye(red) salmon run. 
It‚Äôs a spawning fishery, only open 1-2 months, times and counts are kept track of, each year the same or more fish return to the bay to spawn. </p>
<p>Year round commercial fishing is fucked, and I get that if this was the only com fishing available, it would become fucked, but as it‚Äôs stands, I‚Äôm proud of my home state fishery. Every piece of trash seen in the ocean was gaffed or bucketed back onto our boat. We didn‚Äôt lose any trash ourselves.</p>

        <p>That was a good documentary.  My take away is to eat less fish.  But, Americans on the whole are not big seafood consumers.  A lot of folks might eat some fish on Friday or grab one of those fake sushi rolls at the grocery store when they are half off but it's not a daily habit.  To actually make a dent in the fishing industry, you'll have to get through to China, Japan, Korea, etc.</p>

        <p>I totally get you. I‚Äôm an European living in Ireland and fish although to me personally isn‚Äôt a huge part of my diet, across Europe it‚Äôs pretty common. But it has actually affected me a little though the documenty didn‚Äôt focus on India. I have purchased shrimp that has misleading packaging implying it‚Äôs an 100% Irish product but in a bottom corner it says ‚ÄòFarmed in India‚Äô. But what I‚Äôm saying which I hope people understand that this sort of thing can go unnoticed and people don‚Äôt think twice about it and it goes deeper than the surface level of overfishing. So how could people be naive to think something can‚Äôt go behind the scenes with the government ? I just want people to be more open minded as people can be easily bribed as long as it doesn‚Äôt affect them.</p>

        <p>The seafood industry has lobbies in the US that fight to keep bad press to a minimum.  It's the same with all industries in the US.  Small to large groups in an industry pool their money to hire large lobbying firms that "donate" to politicians that promise to keep the bad publicity/ legislation to a minimum.  </p>
<p>It sucks but that is the world we live in.</p>
