    <strong>Wearing a mask at work injured me. If it doesn't get better I might just file an injury lawsuit.</strong>
    <p><p>A  few days ago after I left work I was grumpy. I knew the mask I was  wearing made me tired at the end of every 5 hour shift (20  hrs/week -  indoor office / setting) - I knew it affected my cognitive ability  temporarily. I remember running a red light while driving home one day.    But what happened this past Saturday, August 15th, was completely  different.</p>
<p>After I got home I felt  this sharp stabbing pain in my head. It was instantaneous. The pain was  so bad I took 2 ibuprofen - which is very uncommon for me - almost  never - dental work aside.</p>
<p>At that  moment I knew it was from wearing my mask. And I realized something new  - the effect of excess CO2 / oxygen deprivation from wearing a mask  indoors is cumulative.</p>
<p>When the  pandemic started I wore a mask to the grocery store / retail stores  (When they opened). Work was all remote since early March 2020. Then in  June it was possible to work 15 out of 20 hours a week  at the office.  Masks were required, but it wasn't strict. If we were at a workstation  sufficiently far away we could take it off. So that's what I did - I  usually worked at a station farther away and took of my mask.  This  "part-time mask" worked ok.</p>
<p><strong>Mask Mandate</strong></p>
<p>In late June my US State - Washington passed a mandatory mask mandate.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.governor.wa.gov/news-media/inslee-announces-statewide-mask-mandate">https://www.governor.wa.gov/news-media/inslee-announces-statewide-mask-mandate</a></p>
<p>My  employer now required me to wear a mask the entire time, even if no one  was around me. The only exception being designated break areas. This  started in early July when I could now work the full 20 hours in office.</p>
<p><strong>Tired Workers. wearing a mask for hours on end.</strong></p>
<p>During  this time I should add I noticed at the grocery store a slim girl in  her 20s who worked in the checkout lane. I caught her at the end of her  shift and I noticed how tired her eyes looked. This was not normal, she  let me know she was really tired - at presumably the end of her 8 hour  shift.</p>
<p>I quickly learned that  wearing a mask for hours on end (4.75 hours, 5 hours - 15 minute break)  is not the same as wearing it to a grocery store or the mall, or wearing  it outdoors.</p>
<p>During this whole  time, going back to early June I have noticed some co-workers getting  grumpier / more agitated at times. I also started to feel more tired at  the end of my shifts. I knew this was from wearing a mask.</p>
<p>The  masks I used were surgical, organic cotton canvas, and most recently  linen. So I recently ordered some more breathable masks - they have not arrived yet.</p>
<p><strong>The dull sensation that hasn't gone away</strong></p>
<p>But back to Saturday. The sharp pain was disturbing, but I went to bed thinking it would just go away.</p>
<p>I  woke up Sunday and it had not gone away. It was a dull sensation that  persists up to today - Tuesday.   I went to the forest yesterday to heal  (More oxygen) and I will go again today. I will be calling in sick  today and likely tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>Emotional Mood &amp; Control. Feeling grumpy.</strong></p>
<p>But  here's an interesting thing I noticed, it doesn't seem to affect my  ability to think or type, but it has affected my emotional mood. As in I  have less control of my emotions. I also feel grumpy. On a recent walk this morning outside, people acknowledged me on the trail with a smile, I didn't even  acknowledge them.  A pretty girl walked by, I didn't even look up.  I  feel unhappy and irritable. I sometimes feel violent.</p>
<p><strong>Power of Caffeine / Alcohol</strong></p>
<p>Now,  you might ask, why do not more people experience / realize this? And  the answer is - they are, they just don't know it. The reason they don't  feel the damage right away is because most people consume a lot of  caffeine - whether from coffee, soda, tea or energy drinks. Caffeine is a  pain-reliever, you can see that by just looking at medication  ingredient labels. You can see that by just reflecting on your own mood -  with and without.</p>
<p>Other people  may also consume more alcohol or regularly take aspirin or what not.  I  drank a beer for the first time in a long time (A year?) on Saturday due  to this pain. I thought I remember reading a story about alcohol sales rising.</p>
<p>I seldom drink caffeine,  as in 95-99% elimination over many years. I drank a Coke yesterday and  the dull sensation went away for a while. But it has returned.  It also  goes away/lessens, sometimes, if I eat enough food.</p>
<p>Different  people also require different amounts of oxygen at different points in  their life. Different people also have different breathing habits under  different conditions.</p>
<p><strong>A Pressure Injury?</strong></p>
<p>I've  scuba dived a lot in the past and suffered a pressure injury once. It  just took time for that to heal. I'm crossing my fingers that the same  will happen to my brain. My body needs time to purge the excess CO2 or  what not in my body / brain / blood.</p>
<p><strong>Protests / Anger / Depression</strong></p>
<p>So...I  realized today one reason for all these protests / anger / violence / looting you see in the  news from various countries.  It's not just the USA. Because if this is happening to me, it's happening to other people.  Other people's emotional control / tolerance is going down and  daily happiness is also going down. That's why there are stories about  people being depressed.  That's why so many people are angry.</p>
<p>A  lot of people don't wear masks for hours on end, they get to WFH - Work  From Home, indefinitely, you often find them being cheerleaders for  something that doesn't even work. They don't even realize the harm it is  causing. </p>
<p>Take a DEEP BREATH to let out that tension...if you can.</p>
<p>I can't breathe!</p></p>

        <p>Yeah I’m pretty sure it will come out that wearing masks for hours on end is not good for your health. </p>
<p>I’ve heard of people getting staph infections, weird pains in body and passing out</p>

        <p>We need to get the lawsuits going now. This is not an "at will" issue since it is now widespread and your employer is mandating medical non scientific orders upon you without informed consent. Lets end this now. We need a blueprint</p>

        <p>I was going to cosmetology school three days a week and we had to wear a mask constantly inside. Classes were from 9-8pm two days a week and 8-7 one day. That is A LOT of time in a mask. I've always hated it, but was making do since this is something I wanted to do. Well, I started coming home more agitated, more tired, struggling to stay awake on the road, dreading going to school, etc. I sneezed in my mask and I can't imagine breathing all that back in is good in any way, since sneezes are one of the body's mechanisms for getting rid of germs and getting them far away from the body. I lasted a couple months and then couldn't take the way I was feeling anymore. I've been having a ton of headaches, horrible nose bleeds, and trouble focusing, along with this very strong increased desire for sleep. I already struggle with mental health issues, and I was getting to a really bad place. I've been fairly well managed for years on the right meds, so I felt like something was really off. Some people are saying that they forget they are even wearing a mask, which blows my mind because it's all I can think about the entire time I'm wearing one and how I can't seem to get enough air. Forget talking for long periods of time. I am shocked that there isn't more news about this, but also I'm not surprised since it would mess up the narrative about how important masks are. I'm so over all this.</p>

        <p>AAAARRRRRGGGGGHHHHH! Right!?!?!? Migraine trigger! Duhhhhhhhhh! So migraine sufferers who have this condition documented are EXCLUDED from the mask mandate. Yippie. But I want you to know something about medicine in our states. We have support agencies for professional medical practices, such as the Florida Medical Association. In FL, some counties that have strict mask mandates refer to the authority of the president of the FMA. His EDICT! And your state surgeon general will also shill in the direction of insider investors. The FMA lobbies for and provides legal support for PRACTITIONERS primarily, no matter how they make it sound like trickle down patient advocacy.</p>
