    <strong>Regarding Fear and Phobias</strong>
    <p><p>This is going to sound a bit random at first, but please bear with me.</p>
<p>When I was little, I was scared of everything. But now I don't fear very much at all. But the stupid phobia I still have? Bugs. I am absolutely terrified of bugs. But the thing is, I don't control and ruin people's lives because I'm scared of bugs. I don't ask to be coddled because I'm scared of bugs. And when someone tells me it's stupid for me to be so scared of bugs, I don't get mad at them, because they're right.</p>
<p>I know full well how utterly stupid my phobia is and I hate myself for it and I swear I try to stop. But I acknowledge my fear, and how I'm being irrational. I try to get better. Whenever there's a bug in my house, I'm so scared I can't even get close to it half the time to kill it. But the difference between my phobia and people's virus phobia is that I know how incredibly stupid it is for me to be so scared of bugs. I know that there's something wrong me when it comes to this, and I'm trying to get over it.</p>
<p>So I know that phobias exist and how hard it can be on some people because it's something I go through. But the thing is, it's important to acknowledge that a phobia is a mental issue. I acknowledge that. It's okay to have a mental issue, but what's not okay is controlling people's lives because of it, lashing out at people who try to bring you to your senses, and denying that it's an issue, and saying you're sane when you're not. I know that when it comes to bugs, I am not sane. I openly admit that. I know I can't live like this and I'm going to have to get over it. The problem is, these people think this reaction to the virus is sane and that they're normal, have nothing wrong with them, and they're not scared.</p>
<p>But if you willingly wear a surgical mask when you go out because of a virus, willingly stand apart from people because of a virus, and expect everyone ELSE to go out of their way for you because of a virus, I don't care how "sane" you think you are, you're not. You're paranoid, and you have a real mental issue. You just have to realize that. You can't let it control you and other people. If you're a slave to fear, you're not living; you're existing. You're an object in the world.</p>
<p>Now, I do think the majority of people only follow the fear because of gullibility, mob mentality, and just because they're na√Øve and are victims to the old idiot box. But I do think a few actually are truly scared out of their wits, and I do feel bad for them because I know what phobias are like.</p>
<p>But-</p>
<p>You can't go around pretending you're fine, controlling other people because of it, and stop living your life. You can't deny that you have a problem and pretend you're sane. You have to try to get better and acknowledge that you are being irrational because paranoia is no way to live, especially forcing it on other people. </p>
