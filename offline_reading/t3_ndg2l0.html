        <p>If you're not smart enough to see that one minute you're advocating for the woman's right to chose "what she does with her body" and the next you're telling others that they don't have a choice deciding what is done with their body, i.e forcing someone to have something put into their body that they don't want put in there, then you're not only a clueless hypocrite but you're also too dumb to have a say in this conversation.</p>

        <p>Are you purposely being obtuse, or are you just not a critical thinker?</p>
<p>Please tell me what the tested long-term effects of these vaccine are. </p>
<p>What are the known effects something like this could have on someone in 10 years? 20 years? Provide me some sources and I’m willing to change my mind.</p>
<p>Why do we have the FDA if we should just take big pharma’s word for it? If big pharma’s confident there aren’t long-term effects, why aren’t they legally liable for any unexpected effects the vaccine may cause like they are with other vaccines?</p>
<p>You’re letting emotions overtake reason.</p>

        <p>Literally how’s that being selfish? Do you give money to every homeless person you see? No, because in that way you’d end up poor yourself. 
But regarding your logic that’s being selfish too. </p>
<p>Do you need to do everything what government tells you? No because you’d end up brainwashed and fucked over by rich people who happen to be in power. </p>
<p>Science is not an institution it’s a process. There are many concerning rapports regarding that vaccine. Since either producer of this vaccine or government wants to take a responsibility if anything goes wrong why should I risk it for people I don’t even know? If that’s being selfish, hell I will be.</p>

        <p>Personal responsability means you are personally responsible for your own actions.</p>
<p>Which means you are responsible for how your actions relate in the real world. </p>
<p>It does not mean you can say "you should look after yourself because I'm doing me". That's just being reckless and irresponsible. A big part of personal responsability is ACCOUNTABILITY, which doesn't mean you let the world burn around you while you selfishly think of yourself, it means you acknowledge how your actions impact others and admit when your actions are, in this case, stupid and dangerous.</p>
<p>How can you guys claim personal responsability and not know what it means.</p>
<p>By your logic, your neighbour should just lock themselves inside, that's your solution? Something you're actually very much against? And that's not even the slightest bit hypocritical?</p>

Now I'm speculating here, but I bet a lot of these people are white collar workers who sit behind a desk all day and eat out for dinner all the time.

<p>I don't understand how this is conflated.  i support UBI, I support socialist polices and everybodys freedom to have safe drugs, universal healthcare and complete civil liberties over their body and life choices.  This results in me being anti-mask "mandate" and against government tracing.</p>
<p>If anything the liberal mindset should result in being anti-mask mandate.  so its crazy to see so many former leftests become unbridled hypocrites and support a dissolution of the very theory of bodily autonomy.</p>

        <p>Hello! You have made the mistake of writing "ect" instead of "etc."</p>
<p>"Ect" is a common misspelling of "etc," an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase "et cetera." Other abbreviated forms are <strong>etc.</strong>, <strong>&amp;c.</strong>, <strong>&amp;c</strong>, and <strong>et cet.</strong> The Latin translates as "et" to "and" + "cetera" to "the rest;" a literal translation to "and the rest" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase. </p>

<p>So clear now, highly clarifying! <strong>No one</strong> needs “what RationalCake thinks ‘personal responsibility’ means: the extended version”. Not even you. You’d be better off just looking it up. </p>
<p>“Just get vaxxed! There will be no problem if we’re all vaxxed, and the high-risk folk will finally be able to come outside and get covid, since vaxxed people will still contract and transmit, so it’s definitely safer for grammie to be out among all these people who can still contract and transmit than if she stays inside, and even you with your zero comorbidities don’t wanna stay inside you hypocrite! You have no risk factors so you should undertake extreme risk so grammies don’t have to undertake any! That’s personal responsibility! Hypocrite!”</p>

        <p>Because what you’re asking for is government overstep and infringement on citizen’s basic human rights.</p>
<p>If your neighbor is susceptible and unable to get the vaccine for one reason or another, it’s their duty to do what they need to do to protect themselves without infringing in the rights of others (your rights end where mine begin).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the government can’t start demanding people begin injecting themselves with chemical concoctions that aren’t approved by the FDA. You’re absolutely mental if you don’t see the kind of precedent that establishes.</p>
<p>This really isn’t a difficult concept. Your type are just purposely obtuse because all you guys care about is virtue signaling and the dopamine hit it gives you every time you open your mouths.</p>
<p>Here’s an idea - go outside and live a normal, pre-COVID life if you’re in the overwhelming majority who have a 99.97% survival rate. Stop living in fear. If you got the vaccine, great! Even more reason you shouldn’t be afraid.</p>

        <p>Thank you! I keep saying this. I cringe every time I see this "It's not FDA approved" argument. It doesn't matter! People need to stop opening the door for them to force it once it's approved.</p>
<p>There are many FDA approved drugs you couldn't pay me to take. FDA approved doesn't = safe.</p>

        <p>Absolutely. The FDA is still a government agency. If some people want to trust it, then fine! That’s their call. Likewise, it’s my call to weigh their guidance however I see fit.</p>
<p>I’ll make my own decisions about my body and my health however I see fit, with guidance from sources that I personally choose. No one should be able to force me or even coerce me into making any of those decisions.</p>

<p>I am not arguing that they speed up clinical trials or that it is not being used under emergency approval.  What I am saying is that the technology has been being researched for decades and it is not some brand new completely unknown technology. </p>
<p>&rt;According to the most cited microbiologist in Germany it is gene therapy:</p>
<p>First off a Tweet from some random person is not a valid source.  Secondly using the term "gene therapy" is fear mongering because the average citizen does not understand what it actually is.  When the average person person hears "gene therapy" they imagine something that is actually changing the bodies DNA. In actuality yes any drug that has any form of RNA or DNA in it is gene therapy.  However it is mRNA is used solely to create proteins in the cell.  It never enters the nucleus of a cell and has no effect on DNA. </p>
<p>&rt;People somehow don't believe this is true. But here is over an hour of people showing they literally can stick magnets to their arms after their shots:</p>
<p>What do you suggest is causing the magnetism? Those videos look extremely suspicious and it is all anecdotal evidence.  </p>
<p>&rt;Fuck this vaccine and anyone who wants to force them on me or my family, sorry.</p>
<p>I don't think the vaccine should be force on anyone. Everyone should make there own informed decision based on scientific evidence. </p>
<p>I do however think this vaccine is a testament to modern medical science.  And if the mRNA vaccine is as effective as it appears to be its ability to be tailored to specific viruses quickly could help save hundreds or thousands of lives in future viral outbreakouts.</p>

        <p>mRNA has been around for a few years yet It’s only “effective” in the sense they produce an immune response in your body. That’s it.....</p>
<p>So show me an actual study of a control group and a vaccinated group being exposed to the virus to test how effective they are at limiting transmissions of the virus.  </p>
<p>Otherwise the “safe and effective” is only talking about you getting an immune response from a drug designed to give you an immune response. That means absolutely nothing when the point of getting vaccinated is to protect you and others from the virus itself. </p>
<p>DNA isn’t just found in the nucleus it’s also found in other parts of the cell because it needs to read RNA to know what to start producing. So yes your vaccine is making your DNA produce specific types of proteins it’s how RNA works and it is gene therapy. Maybe we should just be honest and educate people of how things actually work instead of have blanket terms like this is “safe and effective” and if people don’t understand the full science then that is on them,  but at least be honest and truthful for the rest of us.</p>

        <p>&rt;So show me an actual study of a control group and a vaccinated group being exposed to the virus to test how effective they are at limiting transmissions of the virus. </p>
<p>That is horribly unethical to expose some to a potentially deadly virus to see if the vaccine works.  That is why they did such massive studies with 10s of thousands of people. They gave them the vaccine and had them live like the rest of the population. You would assume they would contract the virus at the same rate the unvaccinated control group would. But guess what they found? The vaccinated control group was found to have significantly less cases of the virus.  That is how they show its effectiveness. </p>
<p>&rt;Otherwise the “safe and effective” is only talking about you getting an immune response from a drug designed to give you an immune response. That means absolutely nothing when the point of getting vaccinated is to protect you and others from the virus itself.</p>
<p>It's a drug designed to get your body to produce antibodies.  And it does that effectively. </p>
<p>&rt;DNA isn’t just found in the nucleus it’s also found in other parts of the cell because it needs to read RNA to know what to start producing. So yes your vaccine is making your DNA produce specific types of proteins it’s how RNA works and it is gene therapy. </p>
<p>You clearly have a fundamental misunderstanding of how genes work.  The cell gets a certain chemical signal to start making a particular protein. That signal gets its message to the nucleus. Molecules in the nucleus determine what part of  DNA needs to be replicated. It replicates that section creating RNA that RNA leaves the nucleus and other molecules use those instructions to create whatever protein it has the instructions for.  </p>
<p>&rt;Maybe we should just be honest and educate people of how things actually work instead of have blanket terms like this is “safe and effective” and if people don’t understand the full science then that is on them, but at least be honest and truthful for the rest of us</p>
<p>I agree we should be honest and educate people. You are a shining example of why education is important!</p>

        <p>Where is the study then? I had this same topic come up with someone else and we shared many different vaccines studies none of them had anything to do with prevention of transmission. none of them showed actual case studies on how effective the vaccine was compared to placebo. </p>
<p>All the safe and effective claims are regarding your own immune response. It’s safe for you to have this immune response and the vaccine is effective at producing that immune response. </p>
<p>Those massive studies where done with consensus data and number of people vaccinated all using statistics based on age, sex, race, etc. There hasn’t been a live in person study showing and documenting the effectiveness of stopping transmission. Show me that and I’ll admit I have been wrong this whole time.</p>

        <p>Well whether you can transmit the virus after being vaccinated is different than whether the vaccine is effective.  An effective vaccine is one that prevents the vaccinated person from becoming sick from the virus.  The COVID vaccine has been shown to be effective in that way. </p>
<p>Now whether a vaccinated person can spread the virus is q different question.  It is believed that if your body already has the antibodies to fight the virus it should quickly eliminate the virus in your body and you shouldn't be able to spread it to other people.  However you are right, there are no completed studies to determine whether this is true. Although I know of at least one that is ongoing right now.

        <p>Thanks for the article and I agree an effective vaccines is about prevention. </p>
<p>If the vaccine was preventing covid then vaccinated people also wouldn’t be spreading covid. </p>
<p>And there is no study for that! One of the main things that has been alarming since they have come out with them. </p>
<p>Lastly that study Is child science. First of all they’re only studying kids in college which are the least likely to catch Covid in the first place. </p>
<p>Secondly they’re only running PCR tests which are highly in accurate even if they  weren’t inaccurate these studies need to have antibody test, blood tests and various other tests in order to confirm what’s actually happening with the immune system.</p>
<p>Don’t be duped by joke science.</p>

<p>&rt;And there is no study for that! One of the main things that has been alarming since they have come out with them</p>
<p>The phase 3 studies showed that there was a significantly lower incidence of COVID in the vaccinated group than there was in the unvaccinated group.  </p>
<p>The assumption is then that vaccinated people can not spread it. This assumption is based on the fact that other vaccines seem to halt the spread of the viruses they are made for. That is why Polio has been pretty much eradicate in developed countries despite not having 100% vaccine compliance. </p>
<p>Also since vaccine rollout case numbers have been going down. Obviously it's impossible to link that to any one cause but there is a correlation there. And that would indicate that the vaccines help stop transmission.</p>

        <p>Phase 3 study is admitted by the vaccine manufacturer to be there opinion and not to be used as a guide to the actual safety of the vaccine until they submit it for a peer review which they haven’t done and most likely won’t do.  </p>
<p>&rt; substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Risks and uncertainties include, among other things, the uncertainties inherent in research and development, including the ability to meet anticipated clinical endpoints, commencement and/or completion dates for clinical trials, regulatory submission dates, regulatory approval dates and/or launch dates, as well as risks associated with preclinical and clinical data (including the topline data outlined in this release), including the possibility of unfavorable new preclinical, clinical or safety data and further analyses of existing preclinical, clinical or safety data (including the topline data outlined in this release); the ability to produce comparable clinical or other results, including the rate of vaccine effectiveness and safety and tolerability profile observed to date, in additional analyses of the Phase 3 trial and additional studies or in larger, more diverse populations following commercialization; the ability of BNT162b2 to prevent COVID-19 caused by emerging virus variants; the risk that more widespread use of the vaccine will lead to new information about efficacy, safety, or other developments, including the risk of additional adverse reactions, some of which may be serious; the risk that preclinical and clinical trial data (including the topline data outlined in this release) are subject to differing interpretations and assessments, including during the peer review/publication process, in the scientific community generally, and by regulatory authorities; whether and when additional data from the BNT162 mRNA vaccine program (including the topline data outlined in this release) will be published in scientific journal publications </p>
<p>And that’s exactly right betting on an assumption. that’s all the science we have to go off of. No wonder some of the best doctors and virologist are speaking out!</p>

        <p>Most rapes are preventable with basic awareness of avoiding dangerous situations.  Don't rely on condoms if you can't afford a child at that time with that person.  Pregnancies that become life threatening are extremely rare and can be well managed medically and surgically.</p>

        <p>I always see this little old lady in her motorized cart at the local meijer and she hasnt worn a mask this entire time.  I asked her one day if she was scared to get sick and she said "no, i dont watch the news", and "even if i do get sick, ive lived a good life and im not about to waste the last few years like a scared little kitten".</p>
<p>Granny is 83 years old, has several health issues and said she would rather die than to ask the rest of the world to go out of the way to make her feel comfortable.</p>

<p>&rt; It’s not my problem to protect u! That’s like if someone has aids or a sexually transmitted disease..... they have it on their body. And my job is to protect myself from them I’m not holding them responsible to protect me</p>
<p>Bad analogy, since those aren't airborne. If there was an HIV epidemic that could be transmitted through the air, then walking around without a mask on would be a dick move. We can't all sit at home for over a year and ride out the pandemic, which means other people have to be around you, so if you're not wearing a mask, it's really hard for them to protect themselves, since there's not enough N95 masks to go around. This only works if everyone does their part.</p>

        <p>Mind citing your ridiculous .15% fatality rate? According to John Hopkins mortality study we are at 1.8% in the US alone with over 32 million cases and 585000 deaths, if it was a .15% mortality rate we would be sitting pretty at 48000 deaths.</p>

        <p>.15% is an estimate. You don't take total reported cases and divide by total reported deaths. Obviously many cases go unreported (I don't even trust the reported numbers), so CDC reports estimates on their site. A 1.8% mortality rate would be millions of dead Americans.</p>

        <p>How would you even come up with that "estimate" so if many cases go unreported wouldn't the number be higher? It's a 1.8% mortality rate of infected individuals not of the population, that makes zero sense. You can use the 1.8% rate to extrapolate what kind of mortality rate we would potentially have for any given number of cases. It doesn't mean 1.8% of the population has died from covid, it means 1.8% of the people that get covid will die.</p>

        <p>Unreported cases would make the rate lower. 32m is all we reported and it's impossible to track a contagious virus. Maybe the real case number is 100m? So that would bring the rate down 3x. I'm not sure exactly how CDC calculates their numbers but a simple division of cases over deaths is nowhere near accurate.</p>

        <p>Love how that's the only thing you can get from anything I posted. It's not that I believe that deaths are in large unreported but I also don't believe there is this mass of unreported cases. Also what is with you people and absolute horse shit statistical percentages? Cite your sources if your going to throw out these hard stats. Or maybe there are reports or any academic sources that back up your claims? Best I could find is a study on a cite called "medscape" that says about 20% of people remain asymptomatic during there infection. </p>
<p>No one on here has posted first hand medical accounts of anything to do with the pandemic this past year or studies to back up your total bullshit claims. I have literally done both, Put up or shut up.</p>

        <p>&rt;Oh, sweetie. 0.15% might be a bit low, but if you're thinking the infection fatality rate is 1.8% then you're going to seriously regret your views over the last year.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;According to the CDC only 1 in 4.3 infections were confirmed. This means that according to the Johns Hopkins COVID case count of about 33,000,000 confirmed cases, the true infection count according to the CDC is more like 142,000,000 in the USA. With 585,000 deaths that's an overall infection fatality rate of about 0.4%.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;However if you use those estimates and break down the deaths by age you see that the overall rate under 65 years old is 0.1%, under 50 it's 0.04%, and under 18 it's 0.001%.</p>

        <p>It's actually about 28,000. You can read for yourself on CDC website, the data was quietly released just recently. The other "muh 500,000" had an <em>average</em> of 4 co-morbidities per person. These were otherwise unhealthy people who were flirting with death as it was, like any other typical flu season they were hence susceptible and succumbed to the virus (or other things, but if you were Corona positive they marked it in the "Corona death" column).

        <p>People with comorbidities dying are still people dying, a lot of US citizens and the global population have comorbidities, which is why it was such a big deal. I don't believe that people with comorbidities just deserve to die because of their pre-existing health conditions. You can't pick and choose number is based off which demographic and statistic you like.
I don't know what you do for a living, but I spent the past year at a level 2 trauma center in the larger city working in healthcare and unless you have a similar experience or are more educated in the matter you can absolutely shut the fuck up about saying "getting played". Maybe you didn't have the experience of watching people drown in their own fluids while intubated but I absolutely did.</p>

<p>That's the result of funky wording by the CDC. It means that 6% of death certificates listed only COVID as a cause of death, but there are many more that list a "chain of event" condition, which is a condition directly caused by the infection, like pneumonia. The actual percentage of death certificates that didn't include significant comorbidities is 42%.</p>

        <p>I'm on your side here I'm just saying the 6% thing isn't true and we should stop saying it. Go through my post history, you'll see I'm far from a covidiot. </p>
<p>It's still true that 58% of people who died had significant comorbidities, and that doesn't even take into account that they don't list "being old" as a comorbidity.</p>

        <p>You cannot say that the deaths aren't valid because they have pre-existing conditions. By your logic you could say People with cancer don't always die from cancer they die from organ failure related to their cancer. Or people with ALS don't die from ALS they die from their heart and lungs failing to work.  More examples like that are all over the place. You could more easily say "would those 500,000 people with pre-existing conditions have died without Covid this past year?"</p>

        <p>They would have died as 3 million people die every year in the USA and if covid was an accelerator then the death toll would have been much higher than previous years which it wasnt.  </p>
<p>&rt;By your logic you could say People with cancer don't always die from cancer they die from organ failure related to their cancer</p>
<p>Cancer is what causes them to develop conditions which cause organ failure. Covid doesnt cause people to develop preexisting conditions. Preexisting conditions make their response less than efficient to covid or any pathogen for that matter.  </p>
<p>So by my logic, cancer is a preexisting condition and deaths caused by related organ failures will still be attributed to cancer. The same way, preexisting conditions like diabetes which elevate your risk of expressing ACE2 receptor thereby worsening your prognosis to covid or even flu, then your death is attributable to said preexisting condition.</p>

        <p>Oh, sweetie. 0.15% might be a bit low, but if you're thinking the infection fatality rate is 1.8% then you're going to seriously regret your views over the last year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html">According to the CDC</a> only 1 in 4.3 infections were confirmed. This means that according to the <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins</a> COVID case count of about 33,000,000 confirmed cases, the true infection count according to the CDC is more like 142,000,000 in the USA. With 585,000 deaths that's an overall infection fatality rate of about 0.4%.</p>
<p>However if you use those estimates and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">break down the deaths by age</a> you see that the overall rate under 65 years old is 0.1%, under 50 it's 0.04%, and under 18 it's 0.001%.</p>

        <p>I'm pro-choice because I'm pro-bodily autonomy in all situations. But I'm personally against abortion.</p>
<p>You can support the freedom of others even if it goes against your morals. Just like I don't drink alcohol. I think it's a disgusting, shit drug (the worst) that causes so many problems. But if they tried to bring back prohibition, I'd be furious.</p>

        <p>How about stop the glorification of sex as easy fun without downsides that it has become today?  Contraception already is extremely easy to access for everyone. </p>
<p>Saying "people will have sex anyway" is abdication of responsibility; the same as saying "people will steal anyway so don't punish thieves."  Sex education should be "only have sex with someone you have known for a long time and are sure will be faithful to you for many years if not a lifetime; otherwise suffer the consequences of having children you cannot afford which is child abuse, sexually transmitted infections, and emotional destruction."</p>

        <p>That has been tried time and time again and it doesn’t work. People DO still have sex, teaching them to do it safely raises the amount of people that do it safely, not the amount of people that have sex. Teaching safe sex doesn’t glorify it in any way, if anything it adds a sort of clinical element that removes a bit of the stigma and the mystery from it, plus it lowers unplanned pregnancy rates and STD transmissions across the board. I absolutely agree that sex is over-valued and glorified culturally, but sex education and attempting to destigmatize and change that part of our culture aren’t mutually exclusive</p>

        <p>I never said anything against sex education.  Why do you put bull in my mouth?  </p>
<p>Just incorporate what I said into sex education.  Sex ed lacks the mental health catastrophes that result from promiscuity.</p>
<p>Also, you're wrong that abstinence education has failed.  Promiscuity was less common in the 1940s when the culture understood the high cost of sex and treated it with the respect it deserves.  Abstinence education may fail in certain communities where it is undermined by a culture which devalues human life and emotional health.</p>

        <p>Sorry, based on your phrasing it seemed you were being oppositional to the comment you were replying to and saying that since contraceptives are readily available the only other thing we need to do is teach abstinence. I’ll admit I don’t know much about sex-ed in the 40s so I’ll take what you’ve said at face value and say that makes sense for the time, especially considering contraceptives weren’t nearly as available or effective. Every sex-ed class I had emphasized that the safest course of action was abstinence while focusing on detailing the alternatives, which I felt was a pretty good way to do it.</p>

        <p>Nah, I’m with you on that one. It’s weird how now being anti this whole shitshow must automatically mean to be conservative. I don’t understand how a man can be pro life and anti vaccine at the same time though. Both are about making your own decision what you want to do with your body, I generally believe men should not be having any saying in this debate at all in the first place until we will find a way how to make all men just as equally responsible for the baby. Many of them run off and gets on their lives, they are not tight to the responsibility in any way. But I’m getting on a completely different subject and I’d rather not have any discussion about it as it’s tiring. I believe you have to make choices for yourself and taking a vaccine is definitely one of them, ESPECIALLY for something as dangerous as a flu virus. Ffs!</p>

        <p>I'm pro-choice for sure, and would probably identify as conservative (though tbh all politicians are the same filthy liars so what does it matter?). What is so difficult to understand about wanting people to have rights over their own bodies? And none of the people on the other side can ever give me a straight answer to "if I don't own my body, who does?"</p>

        <p>because they argue that YOU being vaccinated protects them. Regardless of the fact it doesn’t stop infection or transmission or give immunity. They are selfish and entitled and only care about themselves, why do you think they want to get vaxed and wear masks? I have an ex friend who said that by getting vaccinated, it allows the virus to weaken as it infects vaccinated people and in turn helps protect others who can’t be vaccinated if they ever get the virus lol i was like dude, you do realize that actually works better when it enters the body of those who have gotten the actual virus right? As subsequent strains circulate they’ll weaken being passed through the bodies of those who have had past infections.</p>

        <p>first off you’re being reported for harassment. If you can’t make a point without being insulting you need psychological help. Second, here are some actual facts, unlike your ridiculous opinions. 78% of people hospitalized with covid are obese. 94% of people who died from covid had an average of 2.6 co-morbidities.
Only 6% of those who died with covid, only had covid. 
covid becomes overwhelming when the immune system overreacts and causes cytokine storms. There have been studies done showing a correlation between vitamin d levels / deficiency and the severity of the cytokine storms. Increasing vitamin D, magnesium, and zinc through both dietary sources, supplements, and getting outside and being active and getting direct sunlight are what will keep the effects of covid from becoming overwhelming. Know what will help people combat covid and stay out of hospitals? Personal accountability for their own health. I get outside, eat healthy, take vitamins and go to the gym, I’m doing my part. I’m not going to take on the responsibility of someone else’s health when they can’t be responsible themselves. 
But you won’t hear Fauci tell you that, or the CDC. No they told us to stay home stay inside, and improved our access to all kinds of unhealthy lifestyle choices. It’s asinine what they’re doing, and unbelievable that anyone is still falling for it. Now go eat your fries and donuts and stick yourself with toxins and screw off away from those of us who actively take care of ourselves</p>

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7680614/</p>

<p>A May 2020 meta-study on pandemic influenza published by the US CDC found that face masks had no effect, neither as personal protective equipment nor as a source control. (Source). https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article
A Danish randomized controlled trial with 6000 participants, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in November 2020, found no statistically significant effect of high-quality medical face masks against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community setting. (Source). https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817
A July 2020 review by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine found that there is no evidence for the effectiveness of cloth masks against virus infection or transmission. (Source). https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/
A May 2020 cross-country study by the University of East Anglia (preprint) found that a mask requirement was of no benefit and could even increase the risk of infection. (Source). https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.20088260v1.full.pdf
An April 2020 review by two US professors in respiratory and infectious disease from the University of Illinois concluded that face masks have no effect in everyday life, neither as self-protection nor to protect third parties (so-called source control). (Source). https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data
An article in the New England Journal of Medicine from May 2020 came to the conclusion that cloth face masks offer little to no protection in everyday life. (Source). https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372
An April 2020 Cochrane review (preprint) found that face masks didn’t reduce influenza-like illness (ILI) cases, neither in the general population nor in health care workers. (Source). https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047217v2
An April 2020 review by the Norwich School of Medicine (preprint) found that “the evidence is not sufficiently strong to support widespread use of facemasks”, but supports the use of masks by “particularly vulnerable individuals when in transient higher risk situations.” (Source). https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049528v1
A 2015 study in the British Medical Journal BMJ Open found that cloth masks were penetrated by 97% of particles and may increase infection risk by retaining moisture or repeated use. (Source).https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577
An August 2020 review by a German professor in virology, epidemiology and hygiene found that there is no evidence for the effectiveness of cloth face masks and that the improper daily use of masks by the public may in fact lead to an increase in infections.

        <p>The reason is that not getting vaccines actually harms babies and people and people who can’t safely get the vaccine. You end up giving it to them making herd immunity not work. Those people depend on heard immunity so you not getting vaccinated is not just your body, it’s other people’s. I hope that explanation helped, if you have any questions or don’t understand something feel free to reply to this comment.</p>

        <p>It is experimental until it has been around the block a few times.  The short term side effects are already very concerning.  My body is not subject to the oops factor that may be coming up.  Your expectation is not reasonable that everybody has to get a newborn vaccine.</p>

        <p>Well your decision to not get vaccinated directly infringes on the rights of others by putting them at significantly elevated risk of being infected by disease. Not getting vaccinated is you deciding your own choice to not want the jab (just cause you don’t like to follow guidelines/recommendations) is more important than the rights of everyone in your community.</p>

        <p>I never said their lives were more valuable, but if you think your life is forfeit or at insane risk by being vaccinated you’re delusional and choosing that someone’s life is worth less than being inconvenienced. Also no one is forcing you to get vaccinated, but the reality is that you’re being selfish and egotistical by choosing not to get vaccinated - expect to be judged as such because there are consequences to your decisions</p>

        <p>So we’re going to disregard my points and go straight to the virtue signalling “oh how selfish of you” insults. We’re living in the consequences that people like you brought on by supporting these restrictions. Had you just asked questions, stop sourcing the mass media’s “science” and said NO to the measures then the rich wouldn’t have gotten richer and big box stores wouldn’t have gained 10x revenue while small businesses died, families gone homeless, and teenage depression / suicide rates on the rise. Yet some how my refusal to get the shot is apparently going to cause a lot more harm than an experimental vaccine that isn’t FDA Approved, skipped animal trials, and being fed to us by the same company that gave us the opioid crises. </p>
<p>This virus has almost 100% survival rate, those who need the vaccine can get it fine that’s their choice. But for those like myself whom covid poses no threat..... there’s literally no reason. Especially if vaccinated ppl are supposed to be safe from covid after so me being unvaccinated shouldn’t give them any issues.</p>

        <p>How about not supporting politicians who used these necessary public health measures to get rich? If you left things as they were magnitudes more people would’ve been injured and dead - and that ain’t good for the economy. Politicians that enacted measures to help ONLY small businesses and let the big ones stay afloat on their vast wealth instead of using unneeded government welfare to engage in stock buybacks. Simple policy would’ve avoided the rich getting richer.</p>
<p>Actually suicide rates and depression have been increasing long before covid19 and studies have shown that suicide rates did not increase during the pandemic: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2775359</p>
<p>https://documents.manchester.ac.uk/display.aspx?DocID=51861</p>
<p>https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(20)30528-9/fulltext</p>
<p>Do you know what the main difference between FDA approval and FDA emergency approval is? The testing requirements and review are the same. But the big difference is that the vaccine can be produced at large amounts during the clinical trials, so if the trials are successful distribution can begin immediately. Now animal trials were conducted and you’re a liar for saying otherwise: 
Pfizer’s animal study: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03275-y
Moderna’s animal study: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2024671
AstraZeneca’s animal study: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.13.093195v1</p>
<p>Yeah the opioid crisis is bullshit but the vaccines work, you can hate the company but this product is effective and will save lives. You could also just go for Moderna’s vaccine since they don’t so opioids.</p>
<p>Well your 100% is being rounded up and how about instead of an absolute risk you use less disingenuous stats like the survival rate by age groups and those with comorbidities? We could also talk about injury rate in the short and long term too.</p>
<p>Healthy people actually need to get vaccinated as I explained before but your dense skull can’t seem to register: a large minority cannot receive the vaccine for medical reasons and vaccine evading variants can easily arise in the unvaccinated population putting everyone at risk again. You just don’t want to listen to what someone told you today, that’s what makes you selfish and not caring about others - you prioritize your ego</p>

        <p>“Deadly" is relative. It has a 0.2% infection fatality rate. The vast majority of those it "kills" are at, near, or past the age of life expectancy (and even in those over 80, there's still a 95% survival rate and a pretty high percentage of very mild cases). It's "deadly" the same way the common flu is, but in some ways it is actually less deadly than flu, as flu has a higher chance (5-10 times higher) of killing children and young people. So no, I wouldn't call this deadly. Ebola is deadly...a 0.2% IFR respiratory virus that kills the old and infirm is not. The whole bullshit "highly dangerous and deadly" narrative peddled by media, governments, and their anointed "experts" are why we're in this mess. The fact that the population has absolutely no understanding of how deadly this virus is (and apparently no understanding of basic math and science either) is why we're in this horrible dystopian, Orwell meets Idiocracy nightmare.</p>
<p>You’re right they did do SOME animal trials except they put a stop to it because the animals were dying from the vaccine..... hence why they moved on to human trials. Pfizer and moderna mRNA vaccines aren’t supposed to change your DNA, but absolutely DO change your gene expression, and may very well have unreported reverse transcriptase enzymes that absolutely could alter DNA replication.</p>
<p>Additionally, if the added spike protein now becomes a recognition site for future viruses, everyone with the vaccine could then be affected extremely easily. Sure it’s functional for this strain, but what about future strains, and future viruses.....</p>
<p>These vaccines are a new technology never before used on humans that doesn’t stop spread but may reduce symptoms of a virus with a 99.8% survivability rate which was created in a rushed fashion in a fraction of the time as other vaccines, forgoing the necessary time constraints, that is not even FDA approved, only approved for emergency use are two different things...... However you can be a guinea pig if you choose. I hope you get that sticker, and do keep us updated with your experiment. Cheers</p>

        <p>Ah yes the absolute fatality rate - break that disingenuous stats down into age groups and those with comorbidities. Life expectancy is an average for a reason, lots of people that reach older age exceed life expectancy because the average is dragged down by premature deaths due to diseases like cancer, heart disease and infant mortality. Thus thos who are pass average life expectancy aren’t “overdue to die”.  If it’s so dangerous to the elderly let’s not just sacrifice that population huh?  Also let’s no forget those with comorbidities of any age who are at significant risk as well. I also don’t think you understand on a national or global population scale how many people 0.2% actually is - and these are numbers with pandemic measures in place.</p>
<p>If the flu was so deadly why has covid19 exceeded it in absolutely every metric but childhood fatalities? Covid19 is not individually deadly but because it can spread so quickly the 0.2% IFR can be balloon into an enormous amount of dead people if enough are infected - Ebola just doesn’t spread that much.</p>
<p>LOL where the fuck were the animals dying of the vaccine? Please provide a source for this claim. And don’t use that one referencing a 2012 original SARS vaccine trial. Not only is it not the same virus or vaccine type but the animals also didnt die of the vaccine - they died because the study ended so they were euthanized as is
standard practice. Also you don’t know how mRNA vaccines work do you? The mRNA cannot get into your nucleus and the reverse transcriptases used to make the mRNA are purified out of the final product early in the manufacturing and aren’t in the shot - plus they also couldn’t enter your cells’ nucleus anyways!
Where’s is your proof the vaccines change your gene expression through reverse transcriptases?</p>
<p>The spike protein is only made for a short while. mRNA is an unstable molecule which your cells rapidly degrade. As soon as the mRNA is gone the spike protein production stops as well.</p>
<p>dude mRNA vaccines have been tested in humans years ago without issue for Zika virus: 
https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04064905</p>
<p>For Rabies: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02241135</p>
<p>https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03713086</p>
<p>And for Cytomegalovirus: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04232280</p>
<p>Break that survival rate down by age groups and those with comorbidities kid. It also wasn’t rushed and would love evidence that it was rushed, compromising its safety.</p>
<p>Do you know the difference between FDA approval and FDA emergency approval?</p>

        <p>How about stick to what you know you can trust until you have better information? I mean, that new brand of cereal could be the product of their business associates, in which case it would get the stamp of approval even if it’s made of ground glass and MDF.</p>

        <p>When you say “they” say “get vaccinated, or else!” Who are you referring to? People on Twitter who have no say on anything you do in your life? Or government officials, who haven’t created anything that says you are required to get vaccinated? If you’re referring to businesses or places of work, then that’s their prerogative and you’re welcome to leave or not do business there. If you’re referring to the CDC, last I checked they can’t make you do anything and they haven’t threatened you at all. I get not wanting to take vaccines, but making straw-man arguments isn’t going to help anything.</p>

        <p>We can only drive cars due to the immense amount of work that has gone into making them as safe as humanly possible. Airbags, Seatbelts, and a multitude of other things that make driving safe enough to be an option for travel. I had to take a entire years worth of training just to be able to drive one on my own. How is this even comparable? It's a deadly virus that is spread person to person, not a mode of transportation.</p>

<p>if driving cars was illegal, with absolutely nobody using vehicles then we would have tens of thousands of less traffic deaths. </p>

        <p>Yes, but there’s clearly an “acceptable” level of death, and we’re constantly trying to minimize that with safety innovations - the fatality rate has been steadily declining since cars were invented.</p>
<p>Many people would say that 500,00+ excess deaths a year isn’t acceptable, and are willing to make sacrifices to help minimize that, such as social distancing, mask wearing, and inoculation.</p>

        <p>That doesn't necessarily mean that it's ethical to force people to get vaccinated. </p>
<p>The question of where the line should be drawn in terms of bodily autonomy is certainly an interesting debate. </p>
<p>Just like the question of whether abortion is murder because is involves a life and body other than the mother's is an interesting debate. </p>
<p>There are good points on both sides on both debates. </p>
<p>I have my opinions but I certainly understand the rationale of people who hold different opinions on both of these topics.</p>

        <p>I'm not for forcing anyone to get vaccinated. I understand exemptions and there are people currently right now that just can't get it. The only thing I have seen where they have policies that are even close to "get vaccinated or else" is private businesses. They have the right to do that, if you don't like it find a different baker. However, this subreddit is like on the edge of conspiracy to me. I understand not liking what is happening right now and I also agree that people are doing dumb shit in response to covid. It is a bit overblown. Why do I have to wear a mask for 10 seconds when going in to a restaurant when I don't have to wear one at the table, I agree that it doesn't seem to make much sense. Again, is it overblown? Yeah. Does it exist? Fuck Yes. You legit sound like Anti-Vax in these posts. I'm tired of seeing borderline conspiracy shit on here when it should just be a place to write about not enjoying this pandemic. I agree. IT SUCKS. however, covid isn't fucking fake and the vaccine is completely safe and effective. Grow up.</p>

        <p>I don't believe covid is fake, just overblown significantly. </p>
<p>I'm certainly not an antivaxxer. </p>
<p>But this particular vaccine has not been subject to the same safety standards that vaccines typically have to adhere to, and I totally 100% support people having the freedom to decline to receive it, even if I decide to get it myself in the near future. You have absolutely no ability to say "this vaccine is completely safe and effective" with any degree of certainty. You should phrase it like this "it is overwhelmingly likely that this vaccine is safe and effective, but we don't know yet, and more study is necessary to determine the efficacy and safety in the long term"</p>

        <p>potato potahto, eh I guess they mean the same thing but I was more talking to this subreddit as a whole. I used to like coming here and just lurk at some posts when I was frustrated at the pandemic but I hate what is being posted now. However, I also want to bring up the point that the risks to me (especially as someone with a pre-existing condition) of getting covid are much higher than this vaccine. People can decline to receive it, but I am a bit tired of the posts I see on here. I'm just glad that the CDC is realizing this is overblown.</p>

        <p>The vaccine is “completely safe and effective”? Have you heard of the effects that are being experienced from it? The deaths? I would not call that safe, let alone completely safe. And completely effective? They’re saying that those that get it will be able to pass COVID to those that are unvaccinated. They’re saying that the vaccinated must still follow all the restrictions. Would you call that completely effective, because I sure wouldn’t!</p>

<p>No they don't. Vaccine injections fall under a "bodily injection," and the supreme court has already ruled every American has the right to bodily autonomy. Also, the 10th amendment is a thing. Florida is already explicitly making this illegal, as will other states. That loophole is being closed up very quick. NICE TRY SATANISTS.</p>

        <p>Not sure how to respond to this. Wasn't planning on debating abortion. All I want to say is that as someone that knows a young mother, you aren't saving a life in most cases. You are ruining 2. Yes, it's a slippery slope, but I think that a women should have the right to choose. Honestly, the way I type may make it seem like I don't care at all about the fetuses but really it does make me feel conflicted. Abortion is a really complicated issue. I don't think there is a clear moral answer. For the same reason that I wouldn't want people to force abortions on a person are the same reason why I can't get behind the idea that the government should force women into childbirth. Women should have the right to choose for themselves. Let them take the consequences that come with that.</p>

        <p>OP is claiming we all share a body, basically. Or that everyone is responsible for everyone else's body safety and overall health. In a society that was truly that way. abortion would be considered murder and most certainly be illegal.</p>
<p>Others are bringing this up because many of the same people pushing for vaccine mandates and passports are also for abortion. </p>
<p>You don't get to argue how important it is to care about others, and then turn around and argue that people should have the right to kill a growing fetus. It's a life, it's a body, and by their logic, it should be a protected and cherished part of the collective.</p>

        <p>Pretty sure it's my body, my hand signing the waiver so I can't sue the company if I become a vegetable, and the virus has a virtually 0% death rate. So yeah, the right to bodily autonomy was designed to defend peoples rights in this purpose, unlike the abuse of that right before to murder innocent babies.</p>

        <p>Well if you think there is a virtually zero percent death rate to covid, then there is an even closer to zero percent chance you will become a vegetable after getting the vaccine, or even have a severe reaction to it.  </p>
<p>And no one is killing innocent babies they are stopping clumps of cells from developing into babies.  Also if we allowed better sex education in school unwanted pregnancy rates would fall and there would be less abortions.</p>
