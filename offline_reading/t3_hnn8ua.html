        <p>A cold isn't a virus, but just a set of symptoms in immune response to a variety of viruses, like around 200 of them. Most notably from flu, rhino, RSV, coronavirus strains. CDC THEMSELVES said that most people will experience mild to no symptoms.  THATS A COLD, A COLD,  A COLD !!!! </p>
<p>But for at risk, or just people who might catch it at a bad time, it could be more serious.  Like bronchitis, pneumonia,  ARDS or SARS. But this true for strains other than Sars-cov-2. </p>
<p>I had bronchitis before. who knows what  virus caused it. Coronavirus isnt new</p>
<p>I mean this is really simple common sense, once you stop feeding on the propaganda</p>

        <p>&rt;So i guess that ICU's being completely swarmed by patients is what happens every year.</p>
<p>This has been debunked. We prepped for a wave that didnt happen. The hospitals that had a surge of hospitalizations, were just designated to have them in the first place. In NYC, in general, ICUs were not swarmed. </p>
<p>&rt;Also, by the way you're talking It seems like that there's a master plan behind this whole "coronavirus propaganda</p>
<p>Propaganda?. Yeah if you think everything on TV is true, and never misleading or exaggerated, then You are a complete idiot. News makes money through advertising. Been like this for decades. Even when they contradict themselves or redact, you are too stupid to even notice. Shame on society for allowing idiots like you influence public policy.  </p>
<p>Oh and forgive me, my mistake for ever thinking that  anyone has ever planned anything in history.  Everything we have, and live under, just grew out of the ground like trees. And wealth was just created purely out of honest hard work.</p>
<p>Wow, you are either a child or just have a learning disability if you think that. And nothing you said, made my statement any less true. Why dont you ask THEM what their master plan is? Duh. Stop trying to silence us for asking the same questions. </p>
<p>Again, I'm using the words of YOUR AUTHORITIES to debunk you. THEY said most people will have mild to no symptoms.</p>

        <p>Debunked? Wave that didn't happen? The USA are getting 60k new cases daily and It's very unlikely that it will stop soon, judging from the way people behave. And to be fair the curve was never really flattened in the first place. Why do you think that several European and Asian countries have only had one lockdown and managed to get the situation under relative control? </p>
<p>Even if most people get mild cases, the fact that this virus is so contagious make it so that even that little percentage of serious cases that ends up going in ICU is pretty big just because of how many people get it. That's what happened where I live for example, in Italy.</p>

<p>You moved the goal post again. Your arguement was about ICU, not cases. You are being deceptive here. </p>
<p>&rt;very unlikely that it will stop soon, judging from the way people behave</p>
<p>Zero science here. </p>
<p>&rt;And to be fair the curve was never really flattened in the first place. </p>
<p>What curve are we talking about, cases, hospitalizations or deaths?. You are purposely being vague here. Cases themselves can only be confirmed through testing. Might want to check that variable first. </p>
<p>&rt;Why do you think that several European and Asian countries have only had one lockdown and managed to get the situation under relative control? </p>
<p>There is not much to support that this is because of lockdown or mask wearing. How can something like this be measured? </p>
<p>If they were so good at containing it, then why the fuck is coronavirus in the states? Asians and Europeans been bringing covid to NYC long before the news started to report it. </p>
<p>&rt;Even if most people get mild cases, the fact that this virus is so contagious </p>
<p>That's another lie. A lie that was propagated to justify mandates. The asymptomatic super spreader is a myth. </p>
<p>&rt;so that even that little percentage of serious cases that ends up going in ICU is pretty big</p>
<p>Based on the latter lie. Going in ICU, was due to other factors as well such as disproportionate treatment as one of them. You made some major leaps from mask wearing to the  asymptomatic super spreader myth  to rising ICU cases. </p>
<p>&rt;Italy </p>
<p>Plus Europeans have different hygeine practices than my culture (as in, soap, bleach and hand sanitizer isnt something the government has to remind us of) and we typically dont live with our vulnerable elders.</p>
<p>&rt;Also "racial fabricated tensions" and "riots to give people a false sense of freedom", that point was kind of hilarious lol.</p>
<p>Its hilarious because you arent black. Any person who can run two sticks together knows that the reality of black life is always different than how its percieved by the public, policy and white virtue signaling liberals looking to incite a race war. It's cute that you think all black people and white liberals got together one day to decide to "end racism".</p>
<p>You are hella racist if you believe that most blacks are out here supporting the riots and even the protests for that matter. Everyday black people aren't having tension with whites. That's why it's a fabrication. It's a stereotype and minstrel show put on by liberal media. A small number of unsuccessful blacks who blame white people for their problems,  have been made into a stereotype to represent us. The most popular woke black youtuber saying the same thing was censored from YouTube, because MILLIONS of black people agree that BLM is a psyop.  So of course they had to take that down. It doesnt fit the stereotype</p>
<p>2 things they dont tell you about black people. </p>
<ol>
<li>Black people arent scared of the coronavirus </li>
<li>Black people can care less about black lives matter</li>

        <p>There's no evidence that lockdowns and masks work and yet the countries that implemented both things correctly are in a decent situation. Oh well, that must be random. </p>
<p>Also, don't put the blame on Europe and Asia for the current situation. China should definitely be held accountable for covering up the virus in December/January, which resulted in a silent worldwide spread. But the 3 million total cases of the USA happened because for some reason Donald Trump just hoped that it would go away.</p>
<p>Oh, and Mississippis's ICU are starting to fill up:</p>

<p>Is it still because of wrong treatment?</p>

        <p>&rt;But the 3 million total cases of the USA happened because for some reason Donald Trump just hoped that it would go away.</p>
<p>Biased political opinion and false. Hmmm. And you wonder why we are calling bullshit  on it. To add, you are European who seems to have an unusually strong position on this. A little suspect</p>
<p>&rt;Also, don't put the blame on Europe and Asia for the current situation</p>
<p>Even though the virus allegedly came from China. And this was never my argument.  You are strawmanning. Again, Europeans and Asians have been over in NYC long before lockdown , likely spreading the disease. The "first case of CV in February" is a farce if tourists from hard hit countries were breathing in every restaurant there could possibly be in new New York, since forever. </p>
<p>&rt;cases</p>
<p>*Positive tests without context. </p>
<p>&rt;There's no evidence that lockdowns and masks work and yet the countries that implemented both things correctly are in a decent situation. Oh well, that must be random. </p>
<p>Just because 2 phenomenons exists doesn't neccessary mean they are related . But to entertain this,  lockdowns weren't implemented to be in a "decent situation" (a vague condition you haven't bothered to define), they were meant to keep the hospitals from being overwhelmed, a goal post that has been moved constantly. </p>
<p>&rt;There's no evidence</p>
<p>Yes because, that doesn't count as evidence. Only In the most unscientific way.</p>
<p>&rt;Is it still because of wrong treatment?</p>
<p>You tell me the cause. You posted the link to prove what exactly? Zero context. Again if lockdowns work so much,  why are there rising cases? You folks avoid this simple question.</p>

        <p>&rt;Debunked? Wave that didn't happen? The USA are getting 60k new cases daily </p>
<p>The arguement wasnt cases, the argument that most of the cases are the common cold. </p>
<p>&rt;and It's very unlikely that it will stop soon</p>
<p>Based on nothing</p>
<p>&rt;judging from the way people behave. </p>
<p>As in being on lockdown and wearing masks all day?
Again,  if these actions were so effective,  than why the rising cases? Stop avoiding the question</p>

        <p>This is some of the best news I've heard during the whole pandemic. Nothing will change until we make governments and politicians understand that they will suffer consequences for their treacherous acts of oppression. The lesson to be learned here is that people rising up and making clear they will not tolerate such impositions really does work; resistance is possible.</p>

        <p>Didn't these protests start because Serbian citizens were disgruntled with how their government handled the country's reopening?</p>
<p>From what I understood from Serbian work colleagues, they are against the lack of measures and rushed abolishment of the lockdown - which led to a significant number of new cases and some deaths.</p>
