    <strong>Today is a great day to not wear a mask!</strong>
    <p><p>I work in a warehouse and it gets so hot in the spring and summer. Of course the department I’m in doesn’t help because I’m running around lol. We’re still supposed to wear masks unfortunately, unless they say something in our meeting tomorrow. I’ve just been in a <em>I don’t care</em> state that I’m so tempted to just walk in without a mask because fuck it! (But I can’t because my “manager” is a massive dictator). Well I’ve been wearing it under my nose and hanging off my ear but I eventually just didn’t give a fuck anymore and took it off completely. I stuffed it in my sweaty ass pocket in case he decided to do a little stroll around the warehouse. He was literally standing where he could see me if he looked up and I was in his line of vision but I was extra cautious. Lmao at this point, since none of my coworkers gave a fuck as well, I’m just gonna slowly stop wearing my mask. The TV People said so, plus if they announce it tomorrow then I’m definitely not wearing a mask anymore. What I mean by that is they’ll say that only vaccinated people get the privilege of being maskless and myself and another coworker aren’t gonna let that fly. Anyway, today is a beautiful day so I hope you enjoy it and have a good one!</p></p>
