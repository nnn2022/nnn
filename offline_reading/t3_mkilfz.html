    <strong>Conspiracy Theory</strong>
    <p><p>What if every anti-masker is someone from a foreign country that wants to see the downfall of the country they claim to be patriotic towards? Think about it. COVID is very real. If they don't wear masks, they can spread it and make everyone in the country fall ill. If that happens, many people will die, and other countries could try to invade us in our weakened and collectively ill state. Refusal to wear a mask during a global pandemic is harmful to your country. Wear a mask to show your patriotism and save your country from invasion!</p></p>

        <p>Most likely the downfall is being managed by the very people elected to lead us- no outsourcing of that service will be needed.  Terrorism is a very expensive industry to market and we need to cut costs somewhere.</p>

        <p>You are either very lucky or you're lying. I'll say you're lucky. Congratulations on making it this far. I just think you should know that if we had handled this properly sooner we could have been more like Australia. They submitted to the "new normal" and now they are back to how they were before. We've resisted it and we're still struggling with the pandemic. They don't have to wear masks in New Zealand anymore because they don't have issues with COVID-19 anymore because they wore masks and took proper precautions and cared about their country (properly patriotic, not mindlessly jingoistic) and now they have no need for masks.</p>

        <p>Nice try Raphael. You almost has me there appealing to my sense of patriotism. Yea I don’t think us people against masks are foreign terrorists of sorts. I know I’m not and many of the people I’ve interacted with here are rational, respectful, patriotic individuals. Yea masks are somewhat effective, but I’m not gonna wear one to make you feel better when I’m at minimal risk of a a lil virus with a 99.8% survival rate. I’m not saying I won’t get the ole Wuhan Wheezer, I’m saying that I can (as well as most of the country) tough out the bug. If people are worried, they can take extra precautions, but don’t shut down the world for an over exaggerated flu. If you want to wear a mask then go ahead and I’ll know to give you the full six feet even after this has all died down. The people that mainly died from the China Virus were also obese, or elderly, or had compromised immune systems, or chronic conditions, or died from something way more severe like a mororcycle accident then ended up being having the virus in their system too so they chalked it up to The ‘Rona. My point isn’t the inefficacy of masks, it’s the <strong>slim</strong> chance of actually being harmed from the Kung Flu and the absolutely blown out of proportion mandates and ‘rules’ that the exalted Dr. Fauci changes on a bimonthly basis. It’s straight up fearmongering. I don’t care what the rules is; it’s ridiculously extreme for something so trivial.
EDIT: I think our elected officials are doing just fine with destroying our country from the inside. Vice President Biden isn’t exactly a symbol of strength and power.</p>

        <p>I understand your view. I'm just saying I'm trying to protect my country. I ask you, which is easier to conquer? A country of healthy people, ready to defend themselves, even if they don't hold a healthy skepticism of their government? Or a country of jingoistic people who are decrepit and sick because they are too skeptical of their country to understand that refusing to wear a mask significantly increases your chances of spreading diseases, then the country has more sick people to deal with, then the sick people and the people helping the sick people aren't capable of fighting an invasion. If we wear our masks, we will heavily decrease our chances of spreading the disease, then the number of active cases will decrease, then we can stop wearing masks sooner. We will have no reason for any "new normal" because we can go back to the way everything was. Australia did that. They submitted to the new normal for a short while and COVID stopped spreading and students are now able to go back to school properly. We've resisted the new normal for just as long as they accepted it in Australia and we still have to wear masks. My school is going back to full in person and I almost guarantee that we will have a spike in cases.</p>
