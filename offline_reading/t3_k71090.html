        <p>But..that's how it works. </p>
<p>If you'd take the time to learn what being asymptomatic, maybe you'd know why the mask should be a requirement to EVERYONE so that we can prevent it instead of having is spread by retards that believe they don't have the disease because they don't have symptoms.</p>

        <p>I'd prefer to tell them the truth:</p>
<p>It's morally wrong to participate in a public display of overreaction that predictably encourages overreaction in others.</p>
<p>It's anti-social to keep people from being able to easily read my expressions or understand my speech, and it is unkind because this form of alienation magnifies the loneliness and isolation we're being subjected to.</p>
<p>It's selfish to make it easier for me to avoid responding in the normal, human, compassionate manner to other people. </p>
<p>I want to do the right the thing, the kind thing, the pro-social thing, the unselfish thing.</p>
<p>That's why I don't wear a mask whenever I can avoid it.</p>

        <p>Overreaction? In under a year, there has been recorded 65 million cases and 1,5 million deaths. Imagine what those numbers would’ve been if people just roamed around and ignored it? Me myself is at a high risk of death because I have asthma, but the government here hasn’t allowed us to go home yet. My life literally depends on if other people bother to give a shit. (of course also depends on where i touch etc etc)</p>
<p>Tell me, would you say the same thing if you were in my scenario? If you got the virus and your brother or your father got heavily sick and/or died, would you still say the same?</p>

<p>You stay home the rest of us have a life to life. Also I hate to break it to you but your at risk for all sorts of diseases not just covid. So does everyone have to stay locked down for you and people like you forever?</p>

        <p>Ordering food is expensive. Also as I said, the government hasn’t issued a home sending. Don’t you think I’ve tried to send an e-mail? All I got back was «You can’t go home because we’re still at orange and not red». Keep in mind, don’t assume I’m from the US. Writing from Norway. How should I continue my education if I choose to stay home when I’m not allowed? Also hate to break it to you but sure I’m at risk of lots of diseases. Guess what? There are different levels to that, not all diseases have the same risk. The virus has proven literally thousands of times that people with asthma has a very high risk of dying. I never mentioned that I wanted everyone to go into lockdown, I just stated that I wanted people to be more careful. Stop acting like you can do whatever because you can’t get affected. Wear a mask for example, that helps some. Sure, it can be an inconvenience but is it worse than being a dick to other people who have no other choice than go out? Value collectivity over individualism.</p>

        <p>Their are risks to life just because a few people have problems doesn't mean the whole world should bend over and chop a leg off for them. You health problem is a individual responsibility not a collective one. By your logic the world should just stay locked down until disease is eliminated. I don't care where you are from my point still stand. Their will always be risks to going outside with your problem that is life. I don't care that the flu can kill you. Avoid other people who are sick then. "Be more careful" again not their responsibility and you have no right to tell then what to do. Wearing a mask helps no one they don't stop virus your just wearing a diaper with bacteria that you breath in constantly. YOU wear a mask if you want to don't force other to go along with this because you have a problem. I am not being a dick they do whatever they want if they wasn't me to stay 6 feet away I will stay 6 feet away. If the want to wear a mask I won't say anything nor would I care. Also it is not about inconvenience people like you always plug that in in every post you write. Our freedom or what remains of it is gone. We are going to lose bodily integrity with the mandatory vaccine. Our economy is in shambles we have dystopian mega corps like Amazon and Google calling the shots while small business owners are being arrested for daring to open a small store in a so called "free-market" economy. "Value collectivity over individualism" you ideals in a nutshell go to China see how well collectivism worked out for them.</p>

<p>Or Sweden who didn't make any changes at all. Or maybe the whole is a scamdemic and is nothing more then a flu. Collectivism always destroys the individual then the collective itself. I'm sorry you have messed up lungs but it is not my job or other people or the governments to take care of you. Nice double speak "I don't wish bad one you but I hope you fear for your life." If it makes you feel any better I am pretty scared of this mandatory vaccine they are going to push out soon.</p>

        <p>I was called a loon when I said this wasn't just going to last for two weeks. Remember that? Yea my own interpretation this all a matter of opinion. Everything on the idiot box is true their is nothing more to this then a deadly new disease and daddy government trying to save everyone from the disease and false news and the evil alt-right Nazis. So fucking what tired of that stupid argument I am not endangering anyone by going outside especially when I am not sick. Or are you one of those idiots who believe that asymptomatic individuals are infectious? What did I say that was misinformation? LOL look at reddit, youtube, twitter, facebook, and google they are censuring everyone that doesn't 100% believe in the narrative. They're  are idiots like you even trying to even get this sub banned. Which government and for how long? If you don't suffer under communism you don't learn your lesson. Look at the people leaving California for Texas and still voting the same. Forced mass vaccinations bodily integrity is a pretty big right here in America and everywhere else. Not really we have a central bank and a federal reserve that makes fiat currency like its nothing which is ultimately is. Fun fact it is unconstitutional for the government to make fiat currency.</p>

        <p>The irony is that because of loons like you who didn’t want to take it seriously we’re still in this shit. If everyone masked up and stayed home back in March for a few weeks we’d stop the spread when it was under a 100 cases across the whole country and by now we’d be to the old normal.

        <p>Our fault? Yes, it will always be the evil anti-vaxxing alt-right anti-maskers causing the lockdowns and causing them to last forever forcing the government to become more authoritarian people like Emmanuel Goldstein the leader of them. Dude you clearly bought the propaganda hard and you need to turn off the idiot box and listen to your fellow man. By the way they will never let us go back to the old normal even after the vaccine. But I am sure that will be my fault too for not taking it and causing a mutant strain to spread or whatever stupid excuse they'll inevitably use.</p>

        <p>Not really. I just let cnn and bbc tell me what I want to hear. </p>
<p>By the way, did you know that Soviet government used to send disabled people off to islands and other uninhabited locations? They didn’t align with the image of a wealthy and healthy soviet man so didn’t belong in the cities. Sacrificing the weak for the benefit of the nation, you know. 
Come to think of it, you would actually enjoy living in a truly communist country.</p>

        <p>So fucking what all nations in the past were not nice to the disabled. What does that have to do with anything. Your the one who is for the collective over the individual if any of us would advocate for getting rid of the disabled its you.</p>

        <p>Hmmm let me think. Going to work, getting groceries, getting medications to survive. Are you willing to support people at risk so they can stay home then or is it also none of your business?</p>
<p>How do you not see that ignorant morons like yourself are the reason why the economy is suffering? Again, Korea never went into a lockdown, New Zealand is now week underway to a healthy recovery health- and economy-wise. Mask up and stop the spread. Your own actions are hurting your own economy that is in danger. Small businesses can’t operate either if half of their employees are either dead or in the hospital.</p>

        <p>They should take care of themselves order online. It is not the governments job to play nanny. Don't be stupid the economy is shut down because of government not covid. They are blaming the people because the alternative is blaming themselves. Dude use your fucking eyes how many people do you know or people they know died from covid not counting unhealthy fat fucks.

        <p>And who is going to pay for their takeout orders? And where are they going to get money if they can’t leave the house to do some work? Unless you’re a millionaire ordering take out in the daily will set you back a few. Are you then volunteering to cook/deliver it to them for free? Very gracious of you. </p>
<p>I thought it was the government’s job to care for its own citizens. That’s why we have the infrastructure for the disabled like handicap parking spots. Or are you suggesting that we get rid of those because you wanna be parked at the front of a grocery store?</p>
<p>I know at least two folks who died from it, I know healthy folks who needed up in the hospital. Just because you haven’t seen it doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. Why did trump admit to having COVID if it’s a hoax? Come on, hit me with your best 5d chess theory. </p>
<p>Why is NZs govt not blaming the people nor themselves? Instead they have fully opened and packed bars and stadiums full of people without the risk of another spread. Dude you’re so dense it’s not even funny. How hard is it to connect two dots lol</p>

        <p>Listen, at some point in your life you have to grow up and take care of yourselves, take responsibility of your own health, and not rely on government handouts for everything something a lot of people don't seem to understand anymore. No, the government job is to enforce rule of law not take care of the people charity is a private business that the government should have no part of. If parking lots are part of a private business then that is their business not government. Describe these two folks fat asses old etc. Need or have to? And he recovered from it fine a unhealthy old man. They label any flu or minor disease or major as covid anymore pay attention. I don't know much about NZ but I know Sweden didn't buy into this and they are doing just fine interestingly they have a much lower death rate and infection rate of covid wonder why. Since you dumb I'll explain hospitals are not incentivized to label every little sneeze and accident as covid so they don't their for the rate is down. What two dots am I not connecting?</p>

        <p>You know what friend. I’ll stop right here. I told you that Sweden admitted going the wrong path with too many avoidable deaths but you’re still saying they’re fine. You don’t know much about NZ but you keep pushing your arguments against them. Trump has the beast healthcare in the world and tells you to not fear COVID, and you’re buying into this bullshit. People I know on a personal level suffer from it greatly so I’m gonna go with it’s not just a flu. But you’re clearly not willing to take any arguments, so it’s useless at this point. 
Let me just remind you that the government has created many laws to make disabled people’s lives easier. So I guess it is their job after all. </p>
<p>I wish you to find it in yourself to have an open mind and learn to love and care about others someday. Have a great day.</p>
