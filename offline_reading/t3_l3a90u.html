    <strong>Honest question: Are there any scientific studies backing the claims of politicians about these new mutations?</strong>
    <p><p>See title. I just wanted to know, if you know about any studies about these specific mutations, our politicians and the media are fear-mongering about? Because, other than politicians claiming it to be more deadly and more infectious and citing rising case numbers, I couldn't find any studies or statistics these claims are based on. I mean, isn't it normal for a virus within the northern hemisphere to be more lethal and more infectious during the winter months and especially in January? People's vitamin D levels are low and due to dry and cold air, viruses always spread better during these months.  Did we just discover pathogens yet or what? Normally, everyone knew, that January/February were always the height of the flu season and now it's because of a mutation? What? Do they even listen to themselves? In my opinion this whole mutation subject is a clown show to justify the invasion into our basic human rights and to promote the vaccines. But maybe, someone can give me some more information.</p></p>

        <p>If you look at what they say, they never say that it IS more deadly, just that it COULD be. </p>
<p>Its not, because previous studies show that mutations tend to weaken a virus. Yet, suddenly this one does the opposite? </p>
<p>Its fear to drive people towards the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Exactly, epidemiological data requires time, cognitive biases aside. They're pulling numbers out of their ass.</p>

        <p>covid was never isolated, so no. its all a scam. literally the day of the inauguration the who comes out and says we are using pcr tests wrong and it creates a false positive, after denying this for almost a year now, and govenors are "suddenly" pushing anti lockdown rhetoric after for the last year it was leaders MUST lock us down.

        <p>&rt;Did we just discover pathogens yet or what?</p>
<p>Oh man, so much this!!</p>
<p>This entire year has simply been jaw-dropping for me.  It's like suddenly everyone forgot everything they once knew about virology and immunology.</p>
<p>The excuse always seems to be a shrug of the shoulders and a "yeah, but it's a new virus".  </p>
<p>This is stupid.  </p>
<p>First of all, it isn't a new virus.  We've known about coronaviruses for decades.  </p>
<p>Second of all, is this like some sort of magical virus that doesn't adhere to other well established medical principles?</p>
<p>The Media would have us believe that yes, this is the case.</p>
<p>The answer to your question is:  <strong>We're being lied to.</strong></p>
