    <strong>Lockdowns lack perspective on mental health.</strong>
    <p><p>One thing I’ve noticed during these lockdowns is how the government put physical health before mental health; these are both essential to living a fulfilling life so why do we put one before the other? For me personally, I struggle horrifically with my mental health during the winter and not being able to socialise properly (I’m also a musician so there are no gigs which play a huge part in keeping me sane) is detrimental to my mind. I have genuine concerns for my sanity at the moment as there seems to be absolutely no endgame, even with the vaccine. (I am from the UK).</p></p>

        <p>Honestly, I dont think they are putting physical health above mental. I think they're both being ignored. Unless its covid, you have to fight to be seen or heard. I quit trying.</p>
<p>Could you maybe get creative and use your skills as a musician to create YouTube videos. Make your own gigs on a weekly basis. Even if you get no views, its a bit of structure and keeping you doing what you love.</p>

        <p>Yeah I guess you’re right there, “dying of COVID” &rt; everything else. I’ve been reading and writing a lot so it helps, it’s more of an existential feeling at the moment, the world feels very lost.</p>

        <p>I know what you mean. It really does feel very lost at the moment. Im glad you've found something that helps though. Im also from the UK and it does suck so much over here at the minute. </p>

        <p>Correct and very obvious</p>
<p>Look i wish i could help but i am in a similar situation in another European country</p>
<p>one tip i can give you is to research ("secret"??) maps or lists of business that run business as usual, going so far as to not even care about masks. I saw a detailed map like this for germany</p>
<p>maybe other redditors here can help with that</p>
<p>bit generally i strongly believe spending time in these Establishments might bring back a bit of sanity</p>

        <p>The mass people of the UK seem to love being told what to do, I’d be very surprised if there are any secret establishments.</p>

        <p>wrong. not "the mass people of the uk". this is noticeable in basically the whole "western, democratic" countries, and it makes me incredibly furious, sad and scared since march.</p>
<p>the establishments themselves are not necessarily secret at all, just their practiced policies are</p>

        <p>This world has to become terrible so that people fall for the coming 'solution' and love the 'problem-solver' once he enters the stage.</p>
<p>The solution?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All debts will be forgiven (in exchange that you agree you no longer own anything anymore)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone gets basic income (just enough to live, though)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to the 'virus' itself; for the coming months to years, the virus won't go away and you'll have to get as much as vaccinations as possible. Slowly but steadily, your natural DNA will be replaced with mrna techniques, which makes it possible you'll never be sick again. The downside? You've become an android. See also Elon Musk's Neuralink company when it comes to 'hacking the brains'.</p>

        <p>Not saying that this is a good argument but I personally know ZERO people who have been affected by COVID (apart from having the sniffles and missing work), but I know personally four people who have either had delayed already prescribed medical treatment for a serious condition (probably losing some life expectancy but hey great job hero doctors), or delayed seeking diagnoses for medical issues... That's not even to mention my own and my partners' mental health, which have taken a dive, along with pretty much every young person I know. I used to think there might be some justice, but for that to happen politicians and doctors would have to accept responsibility (at least some) and that is not going to happen.</p>

        <p>There will be no endgame until we grab our nuts and do something about it quite honestly! This is gotten to the point that if we let them get away with lockdowns and these nonsense measures, they will keep doing it... if we show strong resistance or ignore them in great numbers, they would have no choice but to say "oh shit, we gotta back down now" This isn't about health but a power grab and I know what you mean in regards to dealing with mental health issues, you have to do what's best for you, get outdoors to get fresh air, exercise and eat right and also find things that you like to do and enjoy!</p>
