    <strong>Are we doomed?</strong>
    <p><p>I just saw this stuff. I mean I watched it before as well but I mean the stuff where they are saying about the vacccine - they are saying that it will destroy your immune system. I mean that is what some people are saying; but if say 50% of everybody in the world dies from vaccine induced AIDS - like what they are suggesting will happen - then most of the rest of us will burn in the chaos of that for sure. Only the elites in their underground cities and there furnished with ample resources for ultra long term respite will survive. On the surface, a vaccinated mutant superman will develop from the few thousand survivors who had tolerated and survived the annihilating effects of the vaccine. The pathogen and its mutagenic affinities now inhabiting the constitution of the post covid global die off ubermensh as a force of conditioning imperative where any and every threat and incursion by a pathogen might be evaporated summarily in the efficient and immaculate presentation</p>
<p>Are they on the wrong track with that? Or are we all doomed now?</p></p>
