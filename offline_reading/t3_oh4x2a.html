    <strong>My New Argument: I don't care about your health. What are you going to do about it?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm sick of arguing with people and having them contradict anything I say as to why I won't get vaxed. I can talk until I'm blue in the face about how it's WRONG to pressure people into vaxing, It's a health risk to take it, most of us don't need it, vaxed people are STILL masking up, yada yada, y'all know. But no one hears me.</p>
<p>I figure nobody can argue with "I don't care." So that's where I'm at. Let them sue me. </p>
<p>I want to relish in the looks on their fucking faces when I say things like "Yep. I'm an asshole. I don't care about your health, your grandparents', or your children's"</p>
<p>Because you know what!!?!??! They are going to make us out to be that horrid person NO MATTER what we say!! I could say "i'm very concerned about the health risks it could cause you and your family if you get vaccinated" but all they will hear is that we won't do our "civic duty" and are a part of the problem. So why not cut to the chase? "I don't care if you all die."</p></p>

        <p>I've been saying 'you're right I don't give a shit about you, your grandma, or whoever' for over a year now.  </p>
<p>Let's face some common facts here people.  If I have a heart attack and die tonight how many of you are going to give a rats ass or a second thought about it?  </p>
<p>That's right.. none.  </p>
<p>My FB 'friends' might go 'gee we haven't seen him in a while.  Wonder what's up' in about six months.  My wife would probably be upset but I'm easily replaced and upgraded upon and I wouldn't bet against it happening at my funeral.  Oh wait I'm not having one.  Maybe two weeks tops then.  My dogs would probably be the most devastated and that sucks.  Mom and dad.. well shit there goes the $1400 I give them a month to maintain their lifestyle... sorry fam.  My son couldn't give a fuck less if I live or die.  </p>
<p>So ya.  I really don't give a flying fuck about you're fucking grandma.  Deal with it maskhole.</p>

        <p>this is the best response i’ve heard so far. before you say you don’t care about their health, ask them why we didn’t shut down the world to cure cancer? when they respond saying that it’s not contagious bring up the fact that maybe they just don’t care about other peoples health, and that’s the only reason they’re scared of a contagious disease as apposed to a non contagious disease. then smile and say “so really we’re on the same page:) you don’t care about other peoples health, and neither do i”</p>

        <p>Yup. </p>
<p>My aunt who has taken two of the jabs SO FAR told me not to put her at risk because i will never get the jab. Meanwhile she is morbidly obese... I told her that she has been putting herself at risk for decades. </p>
<p>This is exactly what you need to say. Wanna know why? Because your health is not my responsibility and my health is not yours. Why would i even want my health to be in someone elses care? </p>
<p>Heres what happens when you make your health my responsibility: Put down the fast food and the 30grams of sugar can of soft drink robot piss, get your fat ass outside and you run and do not stop running until you do not make me puke with the sight of your disgusting body.</p>

        <p>Yes it was posted here a few days ago. I believe it was Missouri may have been a different city the mayor straight up said they're trying to move everything off Google and that why they had their video removed is very concerning being that the only thing they said was they weren't allocating anymore money toward vaccines as they had enough. We gave these companies billions to develop the vaccine and they are taking money from cities nationally the people's money to get richer</p>

        <p>With you there. I don't want people to get sick. I do care. I think if you reach the point where you're yelling at someone about how you don't care if they die, you're lost. I agree it's not my responsibility to be so concerned about your fat aunt that I need to be forced into an experiment, but we gotta stay civil or we lose.</p>

        <p>Why are people like you always concerned with other peoples feelings? If they are that sensitive that they cant handle being told that a stranger doesnt care about them or their family then fuck em. Too mentally weak of a person for me to be bothered with.</p>
