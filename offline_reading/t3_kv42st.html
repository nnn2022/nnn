    <strong>The United Kingdom government are knowingly misleading the public about Covid-19 deaths on an enormous scale and the evidence to prove it, including links to where to find it yourself. They are doing this in broad daylight...and nobody seems to mind?</strong>
    <p><p>I downloaded all of the publicly available documents and data regarding covid and compiled it myself and began notice major inconsistencies. It would be very long winded to go into it all now, but it is something I am currently writing up.  But for now I would like to show you the following:</p>
<p>Of the 80,000 claimed mortalities, over 40,000 of them were in april and the first half of may, peaking at over 1,000 per day according the 2020 Death statistics:</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/ofzkzb81tpa61.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd9fa54a1925e448d16b1457514bcfd53782609c</p>
<p>I was astounded when I saw these,  from 100 deaths per week to 8,000 death and then back below 1000 in 3 months.</p>
<p>So I checked and the UK government actually issues guidence regarding those statistics:</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/r7nvxjrftpa61.png?width=743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be506f767e1c509821e793e294143c72fd52cd06">https:\/\/www.ons.gov.uk\/peoplepopulationandcommunity\/birthsdeathsandmarriages\/deaths\/bulletins\/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional\/weekending18december2020</a></p>
<p>They state that the statistics contained all recorded deaths and should therefore should not be used for compartive purposes. Clearly indicating an awareness of the error. (The time lag for publication of deaths is 11 days from the end of the week, hence the shift of the peak.)</p>
<p>It was rather suprising they had  including them in the Covid death rates AND INCLUDED THEM AGAIN IN OVERALL deaths producing a huge peak in excess deaths in the UK by essentially registering the deaths over this peroid twice.</p>
<p>But what really shocked me, was this:</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/7zrg5rl2upa61.png?width=1667&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66d2b6f3acd7fbf3c6e25f64dfc7e3958242928d</p>
<p>The goverment website and of course news stations have kept them in the daily updates, DOUBLING the total number of covid deaths reporting in the UK with data they have admitted is not correct.</p>
<p>This is nothing short of an active deception of the public with full knowledge of their actions.  How is this more not widely known? Some people I have mentioned it to seem to agree with it saying "well if it makes people take it more seriously its a good thing". That almost melted my brain.</p>
<p>The first peak of covid is considered a "warning" of how bad things can get, and we are constantly reminded with the image of that rapid climb to 1000+ deaths from covid per day.  Only, that didnt actually happen.</p>
<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg of how utterly shamelessly the government have been massaging the statistics to keep the crisis in full swing.</p>
<p>More to come later.</p></p>

        <p>So, for me, when they announced lockdowns, what never was a response to vírus and then simply ignored the very low death rate, ir became clear that there is an agenda behind all this, and it is not related with protecting oir lives.</p>

        <p>Great analysis. I've been looking into similar practices worldwide and have some info about the UK you may be interested in.</p>
<p>There's some interesting tidbits revealed in <a href="https://youtu.be/dxLDJJb1_KI">this interview</a>  </p>
<p><em>"Professor Carl Heneghan is Director of the Centre for Evidence Based Medicine at Oxford University, and has been paying close attention to the Covid-19 statistics. In a post yesterday evening he revealed an extraordinary detail: the Public Health England daily death totals announced to the media include anyone who has ever tested positive for Covid-19 — even if they recovered completely."</em></p>
<p>Also <a href="https://youtube.com/channel/UCPn4FsiQP15nudug9FDhluA">Ivor Cummins YT channel</a> has a ton of great data if you haven't already come across it.</p>

I'm currently writing a detailed analysis of uk covid deaths in relation to Changes in death registration proceedure and updates to the MCDD significantly broading the situations covid is listed on a death certificate, but it's a long process keeping it to an academic standard and it has to be squeeky clear of speculation because if there's anything at all that can be used to discredit it ...it will be</p>

<p>That graph shows the August revision to the definition of covid death definition as the red data point. Note 14 days later,  the length of the delay In the publication of weekly deaths, the second wave begins.</p>

        <p>I believe that anyone that tested positive since march and died this morning in a car crash is going to be labelled as covid death.</p>
<p>I tested positive back in September so I assume If I die sometime this year, it will be registered as a covid death. But is common knowledge by now.</p>

        <p>Living in the UK and can confirm. The models that SAGE are using to predict and extrapolate future virus growth are based on half arsed inaccurate models from Neil ferguson. Further reading here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/05/16/coding-led-lockdown-totally-unreliable-buggy-mess-say-experts/">Neill Ferguson unreliable models </a></p>
<p>These are what led to the first lockdown in March. Funnily enough the virus disappeared in May/June but of course that had nothing to do with the weather turning warmer but was attributed to lockdown working.</p>
<p>Since that initial lockdown looked like it was working whenever there has been a spike in covid cases, we go into lockdown again. The government seem to forget that with their increased testing, you're going to get increased cases. Especially with PCR tests that generate false positives as much as <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1808">30%</a></p>
<p>As well as this, you have 24/7 propaganda being pumped out across TV and radio networks with the latest case and death figures.</p>
<p>Oh, yes. Death figures. Whereby a death is counted if its within 28 days of a positive test. Make it make sense!</p>

        <p>I am very confused. Normal Covid deaths only count when someone dies 28 days of a positive test result. The extra deaths they added in who ones in which there was no positive test result but Covid was mentioned on the death certificate. So these were separate deaths right?</p>

        <p>The definition has changed 3 times. Prior to April deaths were calculated by a combination of excess deaths and death certificates, but it was so haphazard it rendered the data unusable. Firstly because  over 70 percent of care home deaths were registered as a covid death, but it was also do annymously so there will have been a large number of double registrations from excess deaths Nd death certificates</p>

        <p>Do you know how it was changed afterwards? This seems like the data will never be correct if the reporting of it changes all the time... I'm arguing with people who claim the death certificate numbers are 100% infallible, even though deaths can be submitted directly to the coroner, without medical experts signing anything off, and even then they can still sign off deaths without having met the patient in the last month.</p>

        <p>I am glad you are looking into the UK data in depth, there seems to be a dearth of people on this platform doing so, although I am gradually finding information that is starting to explain some of what is happening.</p>
<p>There seems to be crucial bits of information missing in your explanation and I'm having trouble understanding what you're saying.</p>
<p>However, it seems /u/AlbatrossAttack has below linked a useful video from back in July where Professor Carl Heneghan explains the issue you're discussing.</p>
<p>Info also from the article here: <a href="https://unherd.com/thepost/prof-carl-heneghan-can-we-trust-the-covid-19-death-numbers/">https://unherd.com/thepost/prof-carl-heneghan-can-we-trust-the-covid-19-death-numbers/</a></p>
<p>The summary seems to be:</p>
<p>There are three main bodies who are presenting 'death stats': Public Health England (PHE), The Office of National Statistics (ONS), and NHS England (NHS).</p>
<p>So firstly, can I ask you to cite the sources of your data explicitly.  Where have you drawn the top figures from?</p>
<p>I'm sorry but I really don't understand your clip from the ONS website, and what it's supposed to explain.</p>
<p>Prof Haneghen explains that PHE figures are about double the ONS figures, assumedly because they are counting anyone who has previously had a positive covid test, as a covid death, whereas the ONS are only counting when someone has died within 28 days of having a positive covid test.</p>
<p>The implication of PHE's recording, being that many people who have previously had covid but recovered, are still counted as a covid death.</p>
<p>The Sun, also covered this issue, here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12325214/coronavirus-death-review-lower-toll/">https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12325214/coronavirus-death-review-lower-toll/</a></p>
<p>From what I can see, this error was only with PHE, however, and not with the NHS or ONS data.</p>
<p>So onto your graph, from 'the government,'   Can you explain what you mean by "essentially registering the deaths twice," because I am aware I may be missing your point entirely here.</p>
<p>The label for the graph does say, that it is only showing people whose first test is within 28 days of their death.</p>
<p>I agree that the numbers have been and continue to be dodgy, but we need to get to the bottom of how and why this is the case, and it seems like this issue has now been addressed.</p>

        <p>Thank you for the detailed questioning, It is reassuring to see people with strong critical thinking skills.
When making a post like this, the line you tread is between providing enough information to convey your point, but not alienating the average redditor.
I promise I will answer all the specifcs when I am home on my PC tomorrow, as all my references ETC are saved on that and it is far too long winded to type on a phone.  Please if i forget prompt me!</p>
