        <p>This is getting ridiculous now. I mean, I know a lot of people here are already saying these vaccines are ridiculous. But now Canada has pivoted on AZ what like at least twice. They've already explored vaccine mixing and a developer from AZ said they've seen severe reactions from that. This situation is fucking crazy. I can't believe people who just dismiss people who have concerns about all this as anti-vaxxers.  I've got an aunt who keeps putting pressure on my family and by proxy me to get one and instilling it in everyone not to see the people who don't have this.  She's trying to get her 12 year old an appointment.</p>
<p>If I have to live as a hermit for 2 more years while the world gets its shit together or wakes up, I'm fine with that.</p>

        <p>It's madness. You couldn't pay me enough to have any of the Covid vaccines.</p>
<p>I already had Covid over a year ago and I'm in my mid 30's and healthy - but even if I was 95 years old and had never had it, I still wouldn't consider the vaccine for one second.</p>

        <p>They are literally throwing $1M at people to get them to get vaxxed - that's how desperate they are. No amount of soon-to-be-cancelled cash is worth risking one's life.</p>

        <p>&rt;Each time he felt ill he called his doctor or the HealthLinkBC line at 811 and was advised to stay home — even after going in to have a test for COVID-19 — which turned out to be negative.</p>
<p>All year the diagnosis and prescription for getting better is to "stay home".  </p>
<p>You've got a 43-year-old with no medical history coughing up blood three weeks after a now recalled experimental injection.  And your diagnosis is to just "stay home".</p>
<p>My favourite part of this paragraph is "even after going in to have a test for covid-19".  </p>
<p>As though the doctors suspected covid-19 was the culprit.</p>
<p>Praytell, if he had tested positive for covid-19, would they ask him to come into the hospital?  Or would the diagnosis also be "stay home".</p>
<p>What is going on in our medical system?  What the hell is going on in our world??  What the hell are they doing to people!?  This is utter madness.</p>

        <p>Thing is, none of this will save him. They will keep cutting stuff out of him until nothing remains. There no Undo button here folks. No detoxxing, no dietary changes that can save you. You are proper screwed if you take the shot.</p>
