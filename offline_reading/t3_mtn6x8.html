        <p>This may sound dramatic but in my opinion the mask of 2020/21 is the Heil Hitler of the 1930's. How long before "antivaxxers" are declared enemies of the state?</p>

        <p>Thanks brother.  Here is US Ohio people are unmasking. Even going into stores unmasked no one complains. Been kicked out of a couple places but that's OK. People that see us unmasked I think are encouraged . Had a few that saw us and took off their masks. You are right 1 yr is enough</p>

        <p>Truth! I also live in Ohio and I saw my first unmasked person in a store today in probably 8 months. Old dude. No one was giving him a hard time. Made me happy. I think the dominoes are starting to fall. I bet May-June you see majority of people not wearing masks indoors at all. </p>
<p>And outdoors it’s very rare to see anyone with a mask on. The ones who are wearing masks in the hot sun look like total weirdos to me.</p>

<p>You might not like my words but it's the absolute reality.</p>
<p>unfortunately its a hopeless situation....and for the people talking about "we gonna fight it" come on you know you'll be fighting nothing with your protest or whatever...even the people that still have guns...wtf you gonna do? shoot a police officer coming to arrest you to take you to the internment camps? you'll get shot on the spot.</p>

        <p>I'm trying to stay level-headed about everything, but when Canada mandated that you had to quarantine in a government facility (and UK, too?), I thought, "Holy shit, they're there... and basically no one has the guns to stop it."</p>
<p>It's certainly a worthy topic of discussion, but anytime you bring it up, you're told to go find your tinfoil cap.</p>

        <p>Well, you go right ahead and bend over and spread 'em. I don't intend to. And there are billions of people to stop it, in case you hadn't noticed.  Your pronouncements about "the absolute reality" are invalid. Maybe my ideas are wrong too, who knows? </p>
<p>None of us has the definitive answer about the future. I look at the implications of our beliefs. If I believed as you do, there would be no point in even trying to communicate with anyone, because they're all dead anyway. If I believe as I do (which is that as long as there are people willing to oppose the darkness, we have a chance at defeating it or at least transmuting it), then there's a point to going on.</p>

        <p>i appreciate your input i really do and sometimes stating things like that i hope im wrong but i stick to what i see... and its not looking good... so i gotta be objective and see the facts for what they are and for me it's "absolute reality" altho its a term i invented! still i don't see how the future won't be very very dark its an agenda and ignoring it is being untrue and naive ....you say there are billions people to stop it ....well like you i would love to believe it but statistically it doesn't make sens ...people like us being part of groups and forums like in here NNN...etc are the absolute minority and its a fact across countries....honestly i think at most we are 10% and im being generous...so no billions here.</p>
<p>btw im not bending over and spreading for nobody just being realistic and knowing my time is close and im accepting it.</p>
<p>live free or die it's my moto and better believe im stick to it till the end.</p>

        <p>Thank you for the thoughtful reply. I think "objective" is not the same as "pessimistic". Objectively, we really don't know what's in the minds and hearts of everybody out there. Social media is largely controlled by corporate interests, and it is showing us one vision of the world (and carefully censoring away all disagreement). </p>
<p>Statistically if there are billions of people on the earth, the probability is at least a certain percentage of them are willing to draw a line somewhere and fight. I don't know where or when, or exactly what the fight might look like. But across countries? Please don't make the mistake of assuming you know what's going on with people whose beliefs you haven't checked out with them personally. Even masked people might be thinking exactly like you do behind their mask that they have to wear to keep a job or whatever. We can't read minds!</p>
<p>I watched a show a few years ago about these guys mining sulfur in Indonesia and it struck me how radically different their lives were from mine, and how dumb it would be of me for me to assume I would know what they were thinking. It's just not possible to know what everyone everywhere is thinking beyond a few basics (they want water, food, shelter, love, freedom). </p>
<p>Also the lens we look through has a lot to do with our outlook. If you search outside mainstream media and corporate websites, you'll see a lot of encouraging and hopeful stuff by people worldwide taking action to protect their freedoms. That aspect of the world gets highlighted here in NNN pretty often, so it's not that hard finding worldwide protests and inspirational people doing stuff all over the world to fight the negative agenda these globalist fools are trying to push on us.  </p>
<p>As far as being ready to die, I sure hope you aren't. If I may be so bold it seems to me that you might be somewhat young. I think things can change more than you may realize in a few years. You've seen things change pretty severely in a negative direction this past year, but logically that means things can change a whole lot in the other direction too, right? I hope you don't get too pessimistic to wait and see what positive things may come in the future. Some negative things that I thought would never change actually have changed a lot during my life, and I'm willing to bet you'll see some of that too if you stick around a bit.</p>
<p>Live free or die is a good motto but it's really up to us to take the freedom where and how we can. Like right now I can't travel internationally because I'm not letting some randos shove some crap up my nose- but I sure can go around my town and state and farther if I feel like it, and I'm going to keep doing so. Maybe you'd feel more empowered if you make some kind of freedom commitment like that?</p>
