    <strong>Almost positive I had Covid in October of 2019. Anyone else pretty sure they had it last year?</strong>
    <p><p>It came on almost overnight. Woke up with a dry cough, mild fever, body aches, nausea and diarrhea, and a sore throat. I believe I also lost my sense of smell at one point.</p>
<p>Felt awful, called out of work and went to urgent care. They looked me over and then told me, and I quote, ‚Äúyeah, we‚Äôve been seeing this a lot real recently. It‚Äôs not the flu or bronchitis, we‚Äôre not really sure WHAT it is.‚Äù, and sent me home with a round of steroids. </p>
<p>I was miserably sick for a few days, then had what felt like a super long lasting cold for about two months. Even had pink eye for the first time in 20+ years, which is apparently a Covid symptom. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è </p>
<p>All I know is it was definitely unlike the other million times I‚Äôve had severe bronchitis, and I told my husband in March that if I didn‚Äôt know better, I‚Äôd swear that‚Äôs what I had in October. Well, now I‚Äôm pretty much positive it was. Certainly wasn‚Äôt fun, but never felt like I was gonna die. Unless my husband asked how I felt, then I definitely told him I was dying.</p></p>

        <p>Mine was January this year, honestly I was sick af, went to my doctor he said ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a bad flu this year‚Äù gave me steroid inhaler and nose spray. I was better in a week, though the cough stuck around for 4 weeks or so. Travelled through Italy with my bestie and she never got sick at all...</p>

        <p>I got sick like I never was sick before January 2019. About a full week followed by long cold. I couldn‚Äôt breathe at all. I don‚Äôt remember if things were tasteless or scentless. Horrible horrible cough. So much pressure on my face I remember. Could barely move. Major fatigue. </p>
<p>I rarely get sick. I finally gave in and took DayQuil and nyquil and Sudafed... I was desperate to breathe. </p>
<p>That was another level. And I‚Äôve always wondered if it was actually Covid.</p>

        <p>I had the exact same thing but I‚Äôm February of last year. It felt like I had been run over by a semi and the worst cold I‚Äôve ever had on top of the breathing problems. Then till about June I was still wheezing and had raspy breaths but it finally subsided and I‚Äôve been perfectly fine since.</p>

        <p>December last year. I'm not certain it was covid, I didn't lose my sense of taste or smell (beyond what is normal when you're sick) like most people seem to, but it didn't feel like the flu. Out of no where I woke up sick as a dog and felt absolutely horrible for about 3 days, painful to even move type of thing, and then just had the usual cold symptoms that it took like 3 weeks to finally shake. That was unusual for me because my normal full recovery time is a week- week and half at the very most. So like I said, I'm not sure about what it was, but it wouldn't surprise me if it had been covid.</p>

        <p>February of 2020 my whole family had it, sick for a few days, we‚Äôre all still alive. I work in a large manufacturing plant and we‚Äôve had over 300 cases, no deaths. I posted on another sub about the 99% survival rate and some doomer replied ‚Äú I hope you get it then you‚Äôll see‚Äù When I told him me and my family have already had it his reply was ‚ÄúIt effects everyone differently are you ok with killing your grandparents ( they passed in 2014 at ages 92 and 89 ) and parents( dad had it in April, better after two days, still alive). When I told him this they always revert to the typical ‚Äúyou‚Äôre killing people, I personally know someone that died‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôre the reason we‚Äôre still under lockdown. My wife shut down her business for two months, we spent over 70,000 in savings and completely drained my 401k just to keep our house. I asked one doomer how many paychecks they have missed and They smugly replied ‚Äú Almost none, I just see how little these people care for me and my health so fuck them and you‚Äù This was never about a virus, and these antisocial losers just want to see this extend indefinitely</p>

        <p>I had some weird illness on June 26th, 2019. It came on suddenly. I had been perfectly fine up until that point. </p>
<p>It felt too severe to be allergies, yet too mild to be a cold. I had a headache, runny nose, sore throat, fatigue, and jaw pain. I don‚Äôt know if had a fever, if I did it was very mild.</p>
<p>But the most notable thing for me was that I had a cough. I rarely have a cough. I can only remember three other times in my life that I did. </p>
<p>The weirdest thing is that the symptoms just stopped after two days, just as suddenly as they came. Usually when I have a cold, it hits me hard. Symptoms last for 3-5 days and I usually get the worst of everything. Extremely painful throat, a nose that never stops running, etc. And then they slowly taper off for another 2-4 days before I feel completely better again. </p>
<p>Well, everything but the cough stopped, anyways. It lingered until at least July 2nd. </p>
<p>But I know it wasn‚Äôt allergies, because my allergies never last for as long or make me feel as bad as I did. </p>
<p>I‚Äôm not saying it was COVID, because maybe it really was just a mild cold.  But it definitely hit different than any other cold that I‚Äôd had.</p>

        <p>Pretty sure i had it back in February early this year. If I remember right I couldn‚Äôt really taste and my nose was super stuffed and breathing was hard. I took these pouches you pour into water called Emergen-C, drank two water bottles worth of it and I felt better in about a day or two. It was weird too because I‚Äôm usually only sick like once a year, but i was sick 3 times in the span of 6 months. My mom also thinks she had it back in December, she was randomly smelling soap out of nowhere and had a bit of a cold.</p>

        <p>I had an extremely bad cold that lasted much longer than a normal cold in late fall/early winter last year. I have no idea if it was covid. Possibly yes possibly no. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

        <p>Just saw this, a bit late, but what the heck...</p>
<p>I talked to somebody who works for a company that does a lot of work with a chinese company and this person told me that the people in the chines company talked about an unknown illness already in september of 2019 and they thought it could become a big problem and develop into a pandemic.<br>
Don't know how credible the person is I talked to, but I find it odd. Also think about the strange "vaping illness" last year in the US. I think also in September or August</p>
