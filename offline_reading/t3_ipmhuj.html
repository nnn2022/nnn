    <strong>How many of you were part of the quarantined coronavirus communities earlier this year?</strong>
    <p><p>Reddit was really pushing hard at the time to suppress any information coming out of China about covid-19, quarantining a few communities such as r/wuhan_flu that spoke candidly about the virus. At the time we were all convinced there was a high mortality rate for all. We were just going off of crumbs from Leaked Chinese videos and scientists. </p>
<p>Then the narrative shifted. We started getting more information about the mortality rate, that the WHO lied to us; the blatant political stunts just didn‚Äôt make sense with the incoming data. </p>
<p>Now social media, the mainstream media, reddit and our politicians know they can milk this - all for political reasons. </p>
<p>Anyway, just wanted to say I was one of the ones on here early this year believing that it was quite deadly. By the end of March, I saw through the bullshit. Anyone else?</p></p>

        <p>I‚Äôm too familiar with the subconscious patterns I notice in media, politicians, etc. when a weird psy-op or black flag operation is going on. Don‚Äôt know why, it‚Äôs just something I noticed since early on, especially when growing up in the ridiculous ‚ÄúYour neighbor could be a terrorist, particularly if they‚Äôre a Muslim!‚Äù era of media/government cooperation. I knew it had been nonsense for the simple fact I knew a Muslim girl in my school and she was nicer than most Christians I‚Äôd met.</p>
<p>So when they announced two weeks, I had not studied thoroughly enough to make a sound judgement, but I trusted my intuition. I said to myself, ‚ÄúIf it only last two weeks, I‚Äôll buy the story.‚Äù Alas, it didn‚Äôt.</p>
<p>Now I‚Äôm researching more and more, almost feverishly, and I‚Äôm really shocked by some of the findings. I no longer trust anything they say. At all. Hopefully that‚Äôs a good thing.</p>

        <p>I wasn't in those but probably would have been if i found them. I thought the virus was more deadly back then but my big complaints were</p>
<p>1) let's say we lockdown perfectly and no one gets it for 15 days. Then what? Aren't we in the same exact situation just on a different date? </p>
<p>2) I was never convinced even the suspected death rates justified the taking of people's rights to autonomy over where their body goes and what it does. Especially since people will voluntarily take preventative steps and avoid those not doing so if they think its serious. </p>
<p>I feel vindicated. People who argued with me on point 1 have pretty sheepishly apologized actually lol.</p>

        <p>At first, a part of me was like ‚Äúoh shit, this is it. This is the apocalypse.‚Äù But I‚Äôm naturally skeptical so I started looking into it more and started realizing it‚Äôs a joke. My state was posting daily stats and I noticed the trend that a majority of cases and deaths were in people over 75 years old. Then some family friends actually got it (~50 years old) and they were sick for like a week and then got over it. </p>
<p>I remember the news reports that people in China were collapsing dead in the streets and being loaded into trucks full of dead bodies üòÇ</p>

        <p>Wasn‚Äôt in that sub, but I also thought it was quite deadly at first. I was neutral by late March/ early April and after the BLM protests started in late May, that made me incredibly mad and exposed the true purpose of all of this. That was the nail in the coffin for me to fully become anti-lockdown.</p>

        <p>Not even for a second.</p>
<p>The reason being is I have OCD, being a germaphobe. I have always battled the irrationality of it and treated myself with logic and reason (I'm a christian, BTW). I knew how much bullshit it was trying to protect oneself from germs and particles.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm a natural skeptic and distrusting of authority. I was raised to understand that the government doesn‚Äôt care about me and much of what they impose is a detriment to the natural order of things. I‚Äôm also very comfortable with my mortality and don‚Äôt believe in running and hiding from biology. The only time in history I‚Äôve believed that hiding out from an illness was even temporarily valid was the Black Plague &amp; the Spanish Flu given how young the victims were. I knew they were opening Pandora‚Äôs box by telling people to hide from this and that the fear would be much worse than what was merited. I‚Äôm extremely bummed out that I was right. I actually wanted my skepticism to be wrong for once but nope, right again.</p>

<p>Yeah, it was about that time for me when the data out of Italy started coming out. I'm just all, "wait a second, this thing is killing people in their 70s-80s and already in terrible health."</p>
<p>Like I said before: If the powermongering, genocidal ghouls in the CPC told me the sky was blue, I'd take a second and third look just to be on the safe side. Of course I don't trust a single damn thing they have to say.</p>
