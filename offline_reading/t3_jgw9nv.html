    <strong>Nonsensical coronavirus rules at airports</strong>
    <p><p>I noticed some coronavirus rules at airports that make absolutely no sense. </p>
<p>&rt; The most obvious one is blocking of seats in the waiting area, even though the seats won't be blocked inside the plane.</p>
<p>&rt; Food courts are open, but with no tables. This makes sense in malls, because you can take away the food and eat outside, but where are you going to take food you buy at the airport? Either to the waiting area, with lots of people around, or to the plane, with even more people around.</p>
<p>&rt; Self-service kiosks are closed, because you touch it and that spreads covid, so it's safer to have human interaction than to touch a display? Outside of airports the approach is completely different, interactions must be avoided at all costs. But closing self-service kiosks don't prevent you from touching thing other people touched. When doing an in-person check-in, you will touch the boarding pass handed to you by an attendant who just touched it, you will also have to hand them your ID, which they will touch, then return to you, and you will touch it again. So not only does closing kiosks increase face-to-face interactions, it also increases the number of things multiple people will touch.</p>
<p>To be clear, I don't have any problems with human interactions, or being too close to other people because virus, but I would think that someone that does would be able to realise that these rules don't benefit anyone, and it doesn't even avoid possible infection factors.</p>
<p>Does your country have any other nonsensical coronavirus rules? If so, please share them below.</p></p>

        <p>"The experience of the brainwashed (in our sense) differs in that the inconsistent information is forced upon him under relatively controlled conditions after the possibility of critical judgment has been reduced or removed by such measures as production of excess fatigue, isolation, deprivation of various sorts, and sometimes physical torture. When reduced to extreme confusion, the individual is ready to react favorably to any person or idea which promises to end his painfully confused state."

        <p>It's funny to watch doomers wipe down the seats and be mask police, but when it's time to disembark, they are inches away from people to get off the plane 15 seconds sooner.  Idiots.</p>

        <p>My country's written and unwritten rules are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Children in school aren't allowed to hang out with children from other classes or groups (if the class is divided in two; A and B group). That means if best friends randomly are on different groups, they're not allowed to meet each other in the breaks on the playground. They're however allowed to meet each other in the park or street after school.</li>
<li>Teachers choose to use masks and stay 4 meters away from the students, but use the masks wrong. Because of the masks, the teachers are touching their face tree times as much than usually and refit the mask. When the mask falls under their nose, they drags it. They're touching the white board, computers and many other things after touching their face.</li>
<li>People are worrying about plastic straws, tampons, pads, plastic bottles, meat eating and airplane trips because of the environment, but doesn't care about masks and littering.</li>
<li>If you don't wear masks or social distance, you're selfish. If you're lockdown skeptic because of the economics, environment, mental health, disabled etc. then you're also selfish society thinks. If you wears mask and shame other for not doing it, you're caring.</li>

        <p>The first point of children not being able to meet during school hours is to decrease the number of students the virus being spread to (incase one student has it) and being able to identify the source much easier. The students meeting after school hours is not really controllable by the school.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately whatâ€™s going on here is the airport authority doing dumb stuff, probably in compliance with city and state laws, and the airlines are trying to balance $$$ with PR. They have separate goals and objectives. I can also see it being a issue if some airport authorityâ€™s ban self serve kiosks and some donâ€™t so maybe the airlines have given up. Or they think people feel safer without the kiosks.</p>
