        <p>You uhh. You botched that one.</p>
<p>Hurt people hurt people. Your dude is clearly hurting, you'd be wise to anticipate irrational behavior.</p>
<p>Participating because you were personally hurt by him was not very cash money.</p>
<p>There's a time an place to offer information to those who want to hear.</p>
<p>This guy is wrestling with the idea of losing his son. For whatever reason. He's emotionally compromised in the biggest way.
This was not the time or place.</p>
<p>Then you offered that you hope his son dies...ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Reprehensible.</p>
<p>You fucked up. I'd never talk to you again. No apology would be accepted. No second chances. I'd cut that toxic cancer right out of my life. And I don't blame him for doing the same.</p>
<p>Hopefully he sees the light with covid, but damn dude.</p>

        <p>Yeah, even if Covid wasn't real you'd still be a massive dick. His son was in a potentially life threatening situation and you took it upon yourself to go there and try to prove his very legitimate concerns about the failing health of his child wrong. There's a time and a place for everything and you managed to choose the most harmful time and place to bring up a conversation that very much conflicted with the exact situation he was in. That's like going up to an innocent black man who had just been shot by the police and making an argument that police brutality doesn't exist. Fucking monstrous.   </p>
<p>You probably lost that friend for the rest of their life. Good job.</p>

        <p>Your story is highly improbably. Canada had over over 230k confirmed covid cases beneath 19 years old, and probably triple that in total. </p>
<p>Of those, there 141 were ICU cases. Of those, half were there for other reasons and just happened to catch covid there.</p>
<p>So, we are talking about roughly a 70 in 700,000 chance of a kid being in ICU for covid, and less just for covid.</p>
<p>The mom's chance of being admitted to ICU from covid is and 300 in 600,000. </p>
<p>So, you either made it up or it's a statistical anomaly similar to getting hit twice by lightning. If someone tried to make the case that they'd been hit twice by lightning and therefore thought people should never go outside, you'd likely ignore them.</p>
