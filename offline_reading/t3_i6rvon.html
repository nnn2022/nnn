    <strong>Does anybody know the ratio on the scientific community’s consensus on masks?</strong>
    <p><p>I keep hearing people saying that anyone who is anti-mask is an idiot, they keep lumping us in with flat-earthers and anti-vaxxers, as if there is no way we are correct. Somebody quoted 99.9% of scientists recommend masks, do they?! As I understood it, it was about 50/50 split, that for every study concluding masks work, there’s another concluding they don’t. Has anyone got any data on this? I feel like I’m being gaslit.</p></p>

        <p>Until the coronavirus broke out there was, indeed, scientific consensus - but not in favor of masks, but resolutely against them. This is why no-one ever forced you to wear a mask in the flu season. It is also why Fauci when being "stunning and brave" treated an Ebola patient (and let's not forget, ebola is not airborne) he did it in a full fucking space suit with full breathing apparatus as opposed to a handkerchief strapped to his idiot face.</p>
<p>Since then, we have had some execrable data trying to prove Chinese hunches correct - none of which is worth a shit.</p>
<p>The hamster study where they made curtains out of mask material and hung them over cages is so far removed from mask-wearing that it's just a joke. The recent Lancet paper the media keeps quoting as "new evidence" admits that its conclusions on masks have a "low" probability of being true and the New York study they all trumpeted was withdrawn because the methodology was trash and thus, so were the results.</p>
<p>In the closest actual study to the events of today, during the SARS epidemic, they came to a stunning conclusion. Not only were cloth masks 13 times worse than a respirator, but they were also 4 times worse than not wearing a mask at all.</p>
<p>And here's the thing - "scientific consensus" is a bullshit idea pushed by humanities graduates who think that science is democratic. Every single scientist on earth can form a "consensus" against gravity and yet, not one of us will suddenly float away out of the window for it.</p>
<p>Proof is all that matters, not consensus, and in terms of proof and the efficacy of masks - there is none. Whatsoever.</p>

<p>The Hong Kong hamster study appears to have proven too embarassing to publish, though not embarassing enough for them not to anounce their bullshit and have it run worldwide before disappearing.</p>

        <p>It’s to show that they can fuck with you. It’s part of the conditioning process and also to make sure you obey. It’s kind of an experiment to them, to see how far they can push the public before they snap. They don’t want the public to snap because then it gets dangerous for them so they’ll ease off if they see signs of that occurring. </p>
<p>However, they’re willing to make life so miserable that when they mandate vaccinations (regardless of if it’s safe or not) and push biometric IDs, a global economic reset, then we will all gladly accept it.</p>

        <p>I don't have data, but I want to let you know we exist. I have friends who agree with me. There are even some here on reddit, but they generally know better than to get crushed by the hivemind. Masks are for sick people with symptoms. I'm sure if you have allergies they help, too. The only expert who I've met that disagrees with me is my son's dr. When I talked to him about it, he hadn't read any articles on it and told me that it blocks sneeze spray...which you only really do when you're sick :/</p>

<p>Well, there’s this in support of it - but most of the examples it cites are of sick people (like one guy had a cough and wore a mask. That’s just common sense at this point?!)</p>
<p>https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417906/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent</p>
<p>Most of the evidence I read still boils down to sick people. The argument is that we should all mask just in case, I guess. But for how long? </p>
<p>This doctor thinks healthy people shouldn’t wear masks: https://www.meehanmd.com/blog/2020-06-12-healthy-people-should-not-wear-face-masks/</p>
<p>Back in April WHO said healthy people didn’t need masks... but did an about face later. https://www.businessinsider.com/who-no-need-for-healthy-people-to-wear-face-masks-2020-4</p>
<p>Secondary to the efficacy of masks is my concern about the hygiene surrounding them. People reuse disposables too long, don’t wash fabric ones often, etc.</p>
<p>And what are the disposable ones even made of? What are they treated with in the manufacturing process? What are we inhaling?</p>
