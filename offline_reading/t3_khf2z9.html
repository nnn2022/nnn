    <strong>Can things really ever be the same again? (Tldr at the end)</strong>
    <p><p>Even with the vaccine and assuming lockdowns end at some point (a big assumption, especially for me in LA), can we ever expect this new abnormal to really go away? I just feel like people have become totally conditioned to fear any stranger like he’s some plague-ridden leper, and I can’t see that simply vanishing when (being optimistic here) covid isn’t the number one story 24/7, at least not for a long while. </p>
<p>I’m not a person who loves being in crowds (not antisocial or misanthropic or germaphobe or anything like that, just mildly introverted). But at this point I’d just like to be able to go to a crowded restaurant, a football game, an amusement park, a party, or a crowded beach without everyone constantly eyeing everyone else to make sure they stay in their own damn bubble, or without some sign telling me of the building’s mask policy and what they’re doing to keep us safe. I want to give a friendly nod and smile to the old couple going for a walk in front of me, rather than seeing their eyes widen with panic above their masks as they furiously scamper for cover as my kid brothers and I walk past. </p>
<p>I just can’t see any of these things being possible anytime soon. Even if people start going out again, we’ve spent a year being conditioned to distance from each other and think of each other as nothing more than the germs spewing from our bodies, and I think that’s something that’s going to take a <em>very</em> long time for a lot of people to unlearn. Not to mention with the pressure businesses (and government I guess) face to appear “safe,” I just can’t shake the feeling that these “social distancing” and “safety” measures are going to be the public norm for a long time. </p>
<p>Finally, even if by some miracle we do go back to how things were, and people can see each other as more than walking vectors, how can we look at each other the same again knowing how easily our lives were changed forever, and how willingly so many people accepted that change?</p>
<p>I can honestly say I’ve never wished I were wrong more than I do now, but I don’t think I am. Sorry for the long rant I have a lot on my mind and needed to unload. Thanks for reading and interacting if you got this far :)</p>
<p>Tldr: I don’t think people will go beyond treating each other as potential granny-killers for a very long time, no matter what happens in the next few months regarding vaccines and shutdowns. Let’s hope that I’m wrong.</p></p>

        <p>nothing will be as it was before this whole corona thing. yes we might be allowed to take our masks off and go back to restaurants and what not. but then the next problem will come in which are the vaccines, another thing that will turn people against eachother.</p>
<p>you also wont be able to enter certain places without showing that you've got the vaccine.<br>
sick until proven healthy.</p>

        <p>Eh, I kind of agree, it's hard to just forget about all this and move on. But I think a large proportion of the population is already ready to, whether they are fearful of this virus or not. So I really am starting to think once the vaccines get more widely available, the majority will want to forget about all this and move on.</p>
<p>Might depend more on where you are located though. I know I see a lot of people in my area even now, with no masks on, no distancing, etc. Restaurants are packed, etc (I know things are the opposite in CA) but I really think once the rest have a reason to calm down (ie vaccine and hopefully reports of hospitalizations will start to go way down this spring), then people who believe this is an emergency, will have a reason to feel less that way, and even those who are freaked out now will start to chill out about it.</p>
<p>And I think the majority that are freaked out over this, and push masks, etc don't actually LIKE this or want to live like this indefinitely. So aside from perhaps a small subset who will wear masks forever and never want to go out again, most of society will move on by next summer/fall at the latest. Especially in areas that will have given up basically a year of their lives by then.</p>

        <p>Deaths are gonna drop super low in spring after they start vaccinating all the old people. People are pretty fed up with all these restrictions. People who are have been vaccinated are gonna have way less incentive to socially distance and wear masks. By the summer, I think things are gonna be way more normal than right now. In red states, I think life will be completely 100% normal.</p>

        <p>I sure hope you’re right. Too bad I live in one of the bluest areas of the bluest state where everyone’s top priority is their public image but oh well lol. Thanks for the optimism :)</p>
