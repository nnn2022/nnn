    <strong>[TV Advert] "Hi Folks, American Movie Theaters here"</strong>
    <p><p>Spokesman: We want to you know we are finally having movie theaters opening on the 20th. </p>
<p>Spokesman: To commemorate being shut down for 5 months, you can buy a movie ticket for 5 bucks per show. </p>
<p>Spokesman: Buy as many tickets for any show you want. Restrictions do apply due to capacity restrictions.</p>
<p>Spokesman: Of course, we want to keep you safe as possible: with temperature checks, mask requirements (until you start eating your food), and contactless food delivery.</p>
<p>Spokesman: Our theaters will be thoroughly clean after each showing so that everyone can feel safe and healthy.</p>
<p>Spokesman: We miss you so much and we miss seeing movies in threaters. With all the crap been going on since 2020, you deserve a break from the dystopia that 2020 brought you. </p>
<p>Spokesman: Come visit us on the 20th of August, the movies and all of us will be waiting for you there.</p>
