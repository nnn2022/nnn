    <strong>Had to get the covid vaccine due to threat of losing my job in Finance, absolutely so pissed at myself for going against my word.</strong>
    <p><p>I got absolutely strong-armed by my company and its legal department. Out of a headcount of 60, I was the only person who wasn't vaccinated. I am also the youngest in my firm, and the boomers were foaming at the mouth to get us back into the office asap.  I work in Philly in finance and if it wasn't for my young kids needing health insurance I would've said piss off and wait till they fired me.</p>
<p>I tried to stick it out wearing a stupid mask in the office, looking like the only fucking person who goes against the grain of the overwhelming majority. I guess this battle of attrition from a social aspect for me was super difficult to deal with the amount of shit talking to and behind my back.</p>
<p>People might say just get a new job, but honestly now a days if the stars don't align, it might take 5+ months to find something decent and I didn't want to risk my kids not having solid health insurance.  Maybe in NYC it is different, but Philly proper has a small market. </p>
<p>I regret taking this stupid vaccine, I feel like dog shit today and I was feeling amazing before it. I am young/ healthy and never have done a flu shot in the past. Guess I got to chalk it up to I won't live as long anymore cause of this stupid experimental vaccine. It also blows my mind to see higher up execs who make high 6 figures take this vaccine, I figured they would be so afraid for their lives to not lose this income.</p></p>

        <p>I know it's not nice to say but I hope the money is worth it. I personally don't believe selling your principles for money is a sound investment but I do hope you at least feel better soon and don't have any complications.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day it's a parents job to sacrifice for their children so I'm not going to judge you  too harshly for your decision.</p>

        <p>Of course, since you already complied by wearing the Mask, recognizing their medical authority over you and your own body - then they are free to ask anything else.</p>
<p>That's the point of compliance. It doesn't matter if it's legal, fair, just or ethical. Complying is consent to the agreement using your Free Will.</p>

        <p>Warn others, so others don't lose their health and their lives. I hate that young people are being put under such pressures. I hope I am brave enough, that I will choose death instead of taking that shit [it would kill me anyway in my case--very severe medical problems] but I know people are being given huge pressure and when you have children its even heavier. Don't let them touch your children with that poison either no matter the pressure!</p>

        <p>Hi! I‚Äôm sorry to hear your story and I‚Äôm sorry they made you feel that way.
Trying to see the good side of it: if they are pushing for more vaccines (like yearly) these first doses are probably not enough to ‚Äúdo the job‚Äù. For those who are lucky to escape with no adverse reactions, probably they will continue to push vaccinations.
So, cheer up! And before the next dose, say something like ‚Äúoh I did a home test and it came back positive‚Äù - I think you can evade the other shot for a while. </p>
<p>Though I haven‚Äôt tried it yet, Uk kids were tricking home tests with lemon juice I think? Can try to dig more about this :)</p>
<p>Anyway, stressing and feeling bad because you couldn‚Äôt hold taking it any longer will not add anything to the situation. 
Try to get comfortable. This might be helpful: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XWr2ZBn2dqJ-4rwJabDV5HBnLpatUnYI3jCP7l9c6b8/mobilebasic</p>

        <p>Guaranteed he will be subject to future shots, as he has capitulated to their medical authority over him, and if he didn't lose or quit his job today it will just happen at a later date.</p>
<p>Not a good precedent to set for himself, and now the employer will be emboldened to subject others to the same trick.</p>

        <p>I completely understand. I will have to decide between my job or the jab in the next few weeks. I swore I'd never take the vaxx. Now I'm not so sure. But don't despair. All we can do is live our best life with the choices we make. Of all the people who refuse to take the jab, I wonder how many are men and women who put their family at risk by losing their income. Probably not many. I think more importantly, when the time comes, stand up for what you think is right. Someday, a non- vaxxer will need your help.</p>

        <p>I am sorry about it. Sometimes one realizes only when it's too late. Are you "fully vaccinated" or only 1 dose?</p>
<p>In any way, I would be fully prepared for potential side-effects. You might have been one of the lucky ones and just gotten a saline, but who knows.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if you can get out of it, or how to treat it. But I'll copy few comments I saw about what might potentially help you. For your own health and saving your life, I urge you to make preventing the possible side effects your priority in your life.</p>
<p>1:</p>
<p>&rt;"Look at Dr. Mercola‚Äôs website. Firstly 200% take Ivermectin. I‚Äôd also personally recommend taking the same supplements that prevent COVID-19/boost immune function, namely: Vitamin-D (maintain blood test levels of at least 50ng/ml), zinc (30-60 mg/day), Quercetin (1-2g/day), NAC, Melatonin, Liposomal Vit-C, Vitamin-A (10,000 i.u.‚Äôs/day), etc."</p>
<p>2:</p>
<p>&rt;"lipophilic antioxidants such as vitamin A, carotinoids, vitamin E, coenzyme Q10, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Plus the already recommended NAC, and nattokinase.I think probably the most important thing to take though, is lactoferrin. Don‚Äôt take the lactoferrin &amp; nattokinase at the same time because they will essentially nullify each other.Also tannic acid. But imo you are better off drinking tea than taking a supplement. Cheaper quality black tea has the highest volume of tannins, and green tea has tannins that are specific to only it. If they dislike tea, look for a tannic acid supplement that contains EGCG, that is the green tea antioxidant.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;To clarify, take the lactoferrin and nattokinase on different intervals. Like interchange them weekly or biweekly. The way I wrote it could have been interpreted as on the same protocol, but at different times of day.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;And this is a lot of things to start taking all at once. Some are no big deal to add in, some may take some time to work the dose in. The NAC &amp; lactoferrin specifically. If they have gastro or heavy detox symptoms half the dose and work up from there. I am a huge proponent for taking mega doses of dha. When I take it for therapeutic reasons (anxiety,SADD, adhd fog) I take 4x the daily recommendation. Buy high quality, naturally sourced, mercury free dha. Take any fat soluble vitamins with fatty food (A,D,E) and stick with daily recommendation for those. Good luck!"</p>
<p>3:</p>
<p>&rt;"I saw one of the anti-vaxx doctors talk about Quercetin, N-Acytel-Cysteine, and Pine Needle Tea to help clear the spike proteins and detox the body"</p>
<p>Lastly - one thing from me. Many studies show the possibility of altering the DNA / immune system either by conscious effort or ancient practices. Can't remember many of them apart from Wim Hof method, that has shown remarkable results on the immune system of individual, please try to look into it as well, for your own sake.</p>
<p>Good luck to you.</p>

        <p>Wow what a detailed comment, I appreciate that. I just have the first shot taken yesterday. I would have to come back in two weeks for the next. It‚Äôs just such fucking bullshit to be in a society/workplace where I used to be really liked and respected to now being like a leper. </p>
<p>Cause my firms headcount isn‚Äôt that big and it isn‚Äôt a big company they only give a fuck about any potential liability. I walked around the office a couple times not even thinking like to use the bathroom and forgot to wear the mask and I was getting spoken to like a child that I must wear it.</p>
<p>If I choose to not do the 2nd one I will then have to continue wearing this mask, if I get caught one more time accidentally forgetting to wear it I‚Äôll be fired.</p>

        <p>Lol very optimistic there buddy. Unless the undisclosed graphene &amp; technology induce blood clots kill you first. </p>
<p>Also its gonna obliterate your immune system and embed you with mystery technology that has conductive graphene. Whats the incentive to  put graphene in your body ? Guess we will find out when the studies are done and all these lab rats are dead.</p>

        <p>It's not about that, but more about not giving your employer medical authority over your body.</p>
<p>We can worry about the effects of the Vaccine later - that's just a red herring to distract people from the real issue - that they are giving up their rights to their own body..</p>
