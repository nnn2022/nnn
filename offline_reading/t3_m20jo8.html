        <p>What makes you think naming any of the millions, or perhaps billions of different coronavirus variants makes them special? Is it because the man on TV said so?</p>
<p>While we're at it, why don't we pick another random variant and call it Corona-sinister-666?</p>
<p>What exactly makes this random variant so special? Is it its deadlines? Oh wait, guess what? It has the same mortality rate as all other common cold cases.</p>

        <p>The symptoms for the sars variants are quite distinct from the others, hence the distinct name.</p>
<p>The actual mortality rate is truly unknown, because we're not measuring it.  We're wrong on the actual deaths, because we count everything under the sun, and we're wrong on the case count, because we count everyone there too.  In some patients however, sars-cov-* are actually more dangerous, more debilitating than the "common" cold.  Whether this is because it's less common, and we have fewer previous exposures, but will become endemic, a la the 1969 hong kong flu, or it's structurally different and works under slightly different mechanisms has not been determined.  Both could be possible, it's more severe because it is different, but we'll still acclimate. Your casual dismissal is not from a position of understanding.</p>

        <p>I'm not terrified in the slightest.  My kids are in daycare without masks, they play with friends on our street, we have neighbors and friends over for dinner and drinks, we held our neighbor's newborn and shook hands with their parents when we met, and I refuse to wear masks to the point of getting kicked out of grocery stores.  I just endeavor to understand the science and not just parrot the echo-chamber lines.</p>
<p>Symptoms lists, like side-effects lists for drugs, list EVERYTHING anyone has ever claimed to have thought about in the vicinity of the disease.  For actual symptoms though, sars != flu != regular seasonal cold.</p>

        <p>As I say in another post.  Go talk to people who have actually worked with or been sars-cov-2 patients.  The president of a rescue squad where i ran, as a medic, contracted the disease, spent 3 weeks on a vent, then got back out to running his shifts again.  You need to find someone like that and discuss the differences between sars and a normal cold.  Another emt from there is now a nurse in the covid ward of a hospital.  She works with these patients daily.</p>
<p>I do not ask you to take my word for it, but you would do well to at least find people who have hands-on experience (but no public image to worry about) and listen to them, at least consider their input.  </p>
<p>I do not believe ANY of this justifies ANY of the actions governments have taken involving loss of rights, but the disease isn't fake, and it is behaviorally distinct.  Whether or not it will become endemic in a year or two and then be indistinguishable from other coronaviruses is actually immaterial (although still interesting), because it presents differently and needs to be treated differently in those with acute symptoms now.</p>

        <p>I'm curious then, do they think that covid is literally a hoax, that there are no severe presentations that they wouldn't expect to see from any other cold virus?  Or do you not believe them?  The nurse friend that I see regularly (she drives up to visit us when she has time between shifts) isn't scared of it, but does recognize the impact it has on her patients (most of whom are dying from otherwise terminal conditions anyway).</p>

<p>Do you really want me to quote each sentence and tell you how each one was wrong?  Okay.</p>
<p>You didn't link any sources.  All you said to ME was that people are seriously ill hen they have covid, you have a nurse friend who can spot a covid patient with ease without doing any kind of lab work, and that covid symptoms aren't anything like the flu.</p>
<p>Wrong wrong wrong wrong.</p>
<p>All of those are wrong.  All of those are lies.  You are wrong.  you're either lying or you're extremely gullible.</p>
<p>The CDC even says you're wrong.  They list every single symptom of covid and influenza.  Every single one.  They are the same.</p>

<p>I do have friends who work in, or have been in ICUs for covid.  (long fire/rescue background, you meet a ton of nurses, medics, etc.)  The lung involvement, low sats, poor vent response, etc. are not the same in sars vs common colds.  </p>
<p>For those with compromised immune responses, covid is severe enough to do what the flu usually does each year as a harvesting effect.  Seasonal colds, corona or rhino, are not.</p>
<p>Ignore the tv, ignore "experts" on reddit, talk to people actually doing the work, doing the studies, read the relevant biology texts, to gain a broad understanding.  If you're in an echo chamber of any sort, you're not getting good info.</p>

        <p>There's no reason to believe my claims, I can't or won't back them up with personal proof.  (There's also no reason to be an ass.)  Like I said, go find actual nurses who have worked with acute sars patients.  Talk to doctors who have tried and failed to treat some of them.  Talk to people who have spent weeks in the ICU on a vent.  (The president of (and medic at) one of the rescue squads where I ran.)  </p>
<p>I'm not claiming anything about sars-cov-2 or covid is world changing or worth <em>anything</em> that's been done, but it also isn't fake.</p>
<p>(If you want to discuss the protocols, physics, and real-world considerations of getting water to firemen in burning buildings I can probably convincingly back up my fire experience, but pressure loss equations are pretty dry :)</p>
