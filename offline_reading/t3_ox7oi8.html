        <p>I did this on r/teachers when they were ganging up on someone calling them dispicable, yada yada yada, for going against them when they started condoning forcing children to have the  shot before the new school year whether or not these psychopaths say it's "safe". Of course, <em>I</em> got banned (odds are they did too). I don't think I was helping someone totally on our side, but definitely with one foot in the door. </p>
<p>Either way, I'll almost always back up someone whom has a few brain cells to rub together against these zombies.</p>

        <p>Amen, and great job.  Sticking together for what we know is the truth is vital for our survival.  I avoided taking a vocal stand for awhile, when people were still allowing others personal sovereignty for what goes into their body intentionally.  But currently, I can no longer be idle against these corrupt forces.</p>

        <p>For sure. I've been anti-vaxx and belonged to a fringe (non) political standing point my whole adult life. I wanted to homeschool my children from the get go. I felt no need to force my beliefs on other people or offer my unsolicited opinion when they left me to my own devices. This whole thing is nefarious, though, and we aren't blind to what is likely to be coming. People are outright advocating for those whom choose to practice their autonomy to be starved, denied employment, denied medical care, to be forced into "consenting" by force and coercion (which is inherently contradictory). These people <em>hope</em> for the deaths of those that don't blindly follow the dictates of a government and their agencies that have time and again been proven to be corrupt and party to atrocious happenings. </p>
<p>They are hoping that our human instinct to blend in will override our will to survive/moral compass. Hence the factcheckers, censorship, bans from subs (one's participated in and one's not). They're hoping they can quell us into submission by shunning us, punishing us by taking away our "social media", ostracizing us from a society that wishes nothing upon us but pure fascistic wickedness. I have never felt the need to "fit in", and I don't know about everyone else, but this has done nothing to change my mind about that. They can go ahead and ban me, censor me, fact check me, but I won't let any of this slide.</p>
