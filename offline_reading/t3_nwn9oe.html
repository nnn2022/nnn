<p>What kind of fucking world is this, where employers can force people to take an experimental and unapproved injection for a mild virus that has pretty much run it's course. This is laying the groundwork for the tyranny to come, and so many people just blindly went along with this shit.. people have no idea what's coming.</p>

        <p>The companies making the shots are asking for full fda approval by summer. What will you say once it‚Äôs all fda approved (and this fast!)? They‚Äôll have that backing them ‚Äúit‚Äôs not experimental anymore it‚Äôs fully approved just get it‚Äù üò¨</p>

        <p>Yeah I'm sure they'll get approved, but I still won't take it. The pharmaceutical industry has corrupted the FDA and the government and the media and the healthcare industry, I don't trust any of them.</p>

        <p>Many here believe they won‚Äôt get approved (shows that many still need to be educated about the corruption at the FDA and big pharma). We shouldn‚Äôt be trusting any product big pharma pushes or the FDA approves. We need to question everything. Literally everything. Including the other approved shots and every drug.</p>

        <p>If it is sooo safe why does big pharma have immunity? 
Because they don‚Äôt care about curing you only profit. All the side effects generate millions in additional income for the hospitals and big pharma. Screw them all I don‚Äôt trust most doctors anyway. 
Just remember everyone it is called medical practice for a reason.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm in the state and a RN (on fmla at the moment, working contract placements with health department).  Problem here is our hospitals have all been gobbled up into 3 major systems that control not just all the hospitals but the outpatient practices as well.  This is Hopkins, university Maryland, medstar and lifebrisge (lifebridge has bigger footprint beyond the hospital, largely physician practices.  This gives these massive ‚Äúnot for profit üôÑ institutions‚Äù have little concern for their staff. The latest data shows about 30% of hospital staff (I assume this is statewide) remain unvaccinated. With all the systems working together, there will be little opportunity to find comparable employment. There is absolutely no way they could extend this to long term care/rehab facilities as the ‚Äúrefusers‚Äù are a much larger percent, and paid crap for some of the hardest work imaginable.  </p>
<p>Those most likely to reject vaxx here are techs, evs, or lower level employees who the hospital is all too willing to replace.  These same heroes who worked with used surgical masks for week in first wave with no protection if they were quarantined/sick during first wave.  All the while these policy dictators zoomed in their ever changing ‚Äúrules‚Äù hourly, food delivered, and no childcare dilemmas (working at home). </p>
<p>Nothing pisses me off more than the ‚Äúeducated‚Äù demeaning the knowledge these people have because they reject the vaccine. Many have had it, been closer than any of these ‚Äúexperts‚Äù, and know they are disposable to their institution. </p>
<p>I‚Äôm quite interested in how this will turn out as I watched the Methodist hospital saga over many months (the TS senate was considering legislation preventing this type of thing but guess it didn‚Äôt pass or they got a carve out).</p>
<p>What pisses me off the most is the cdc, fda, pharma employees, government at all levels, media‚Ä¶no mandates at all. Shit in Maryland government employees got 1k bonuses after year of zooming, and they get 500 for getting a shot.  </p>
<p>I hate this state.</p>
