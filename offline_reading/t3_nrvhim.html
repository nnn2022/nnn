    <strong>Rant/Looking for advice ; About to see family member who is WAY too fearful of COVID. Could use help or encouragement...</strong>
    <p><p>Don't know where else to post, but y'all seem like like-minded people:</p>
<p>Later this month I'm going to be meeting up with my extended family for a week-long vacation together. We're all from different parts of the country, and have had very different covid experiences. My family and were probably at about 75% "normalcy" by about Sept 2020, but avoided large crowds and did most social things outdoors. By the time the spring rolled around we got the jabs, mask mandates are going away, and we're pretty much living our normal pre-covid lives. The world isn't the same, of course, and I managed to talk my way into a permanent WFH situation (woot), but, like, we're living life. We've known a few people who've had covid, but that's it. I should mention we're also not in regular contact with anyone considered at risk, or we'd (of course) be more careful. </p>
<p>My brother and his family—who we'll be vacationing with, among the rest of the family—are as scared as you can possibly get. Like, this will be the first time they're <em>really</em> breaking quarantine. </p>
<ol>
<li>They lived in a big city and covid <em>did</em> get pretty bad there. But from March 15 till like July 1, they did not set foot outside their apartment until they literally moved out of the city</li>
<li>When they moved to a house in the burbs, they found their sewage pipe was severely cracked. This is a "raw sewage will flood your entire house at any moment if you don't get this fixed" problem. They went back and forth for a week about whether to let a plumber inside their home to even look at it. </li>
<li>Though we live very far away from them (ie a flight not a drive), we had an opportunity to come visit them while we were in the area for something else. We brought our youngest who was still a nursing infant. We offered to come by their place for an <strong>outdoor, masked, socially distanced, 30-minute-only visit</strong> so that they could meet their new-born nephew (my son). They said no. Didn't want to "break their bubble." </li>
<li>One major reason we're going on this vacation is to spend time near where our grandmother lives. She's very much nearing the end of her life (we thought we lost her earlier this year). Pretty much no matter what, there's a very strong likelihood this is our last chance to be with her, and the only time my kids will ever really meet her. Big bro doesn't want us to see her since it would "break our bubble." Everyone involved is vaccinated except the kids, who don't really transmit....</li>
<li>When the CDC came out with the whole "we can take the masks off now" thing last month, they literally emailed the family and said it changes nothing about vacation plans and they still refuse to un-quarantine. </li>
<li>We're all fully vaccinated, but they demanded we all get TWO consecutive negative tests prior to going on vacation with them. Because the first test might be faulty. </li>
</ol>
<p>Btw: they have absolutely <em>no</em> risk factors. No immuno-suppression, no comorbidities, nothing. </p>
<p>I'm honestly amazed they are even coming, with how scared they are all the time. </p>
<p>My brother and I aren't that close, we just get along. And there's a whole bunch of old big-bro-little-bro crap mixed in too, plus very different personalities. From my perspective, he's abrasive, combative, intolerant of disagreement, and uncomprehending of other people's opinions. For my part, I suck at standing up to him, and kinda stopped listening to him altogether about ten years ago. It keeps the peace, because <em>no one</em> in my family really stands up to him. </p>
<p>How on earth can I try (or even hope) to avoid an immediate, intractable conflict while also, you know, not giving into the crazy?</p></p>

        <p>I've had to endure this too. </p>
<p>I think there's a time to voice your opinion, and other times to  be quiet. I think this is probably a time to endure, and just to save face with your family. </p>
<p>I think you've found a good resolution with your brother by just ignoring him. If you don't have to spend much time around him normally, just let it fly. You'll only look like the bad one if your create any abrasive situation, being that your bro has been enabled to do it for so long. </p>
<p>Many people here will advise you to give the middle finger to your family and vocalise your opinion, I think that in this situation,it's wrong.</p>
<p>What I do in these situations, is just meditate in the moment, focus on my breathing and just zone out. Just let it all go. If they ask your opinion, just stick to your guns but keep the gun powder dry... In other words, say little. Given the fear factor, they are not ready to be awakened, so just let them be. </p>
<p>Being free, brings great responsibility and sometimes seeing   outside of the box is an absolute curse. In your mind, you hold weapons if mass destruction, just be sure you don't use them to destroy your family. </p>
<p>Good luck</p>

        <p>They can't fire you, your family. Mock them for denying science and refuse to go anywhere publicly worth them if they insist on wearing a mask. That shit's embarrassing.</p>
