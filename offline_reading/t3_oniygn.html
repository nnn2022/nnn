    <strong>Aside from "the beginning" or "day 1", when did you start questioning Covid and/or the vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>With me it was when my grandmother died last year. Her death certificate said her death was due to Covid however there was a problem, my grandmother never had Covid... My mother (who believes all the media lies with Covid) had to get it changed. This made me start to question the number of deaths and everything else.</p></p>

        <p>When George Floyd protests/riots were met with enthusiastic support by the exact same people who were panicking over COVID because "racism is a public health crisis" or whatever. When there were four goddamn funerals for George but services for other people weren't allowed.</p>

        <p>Me too. Regardless of how I personally feel, I believe protestors have a right to assemble, but when I saw politicians encouraging this but shutting down the synagogues and churches and telling people they weren’t allowed to attend funerals for their loved ones, that was it for me.</p>

        <p>Yea.. didn't lord fauci and others say the protests actually helped slow the spread because "most people" were wearing masks and social distancing- when watching 30 seconds of the protests would show a completely different story of huge crowds with very few in masks. "Don't believe what you see" or whatever that quote is played out right in front of us and most people didn't even question it.</p>

        <p>This.  I fell off the wagon of lies around this same time.  I checked out mentally.  Cancelled all social media, and worked to get my home in a red state, but blue city, sold, and moved to Florida.  Red state, red city, red county.  It’s better, by night and day.</p>
<p>I never seriously considered how political the whole thing was/is until around Memorial Day, 2020.  Isn’t it ironic that what occurred in Minneapolis, MN, changed so many of our minds, and opened our eyes.</p>

        <p>I'm a software developer and tech entrepreneur who's raised tens of millions of dollars for projects and built complex marketing tools for over a decade.   </p>
<p>When COVID just started appearing in China in early january 2020 I was sold. I really believed that we were facing something extremely dangerous and I started warning people around me. Fast forward to late february and COVID "strikes" Europe. In about two days I made a plan for how to keep society open and safe through software in the pandemic that I thought was waiting. I sent it to some major investors who then put me in contact with the equalance of CDC in my country.  </p>
<p>I presented it to them, they had a day long meeting discussing my solution and ended up with telling me "We believe in your vision, it would probably work amazing, but people from the top are prohibiting us from moving forward". That virologist that was my main contact came with true sadness in her eyes and said she had no idea what was going on and that nothing made sense.  </p>
<p>That was the exact point that I realized that one of these was true:  </p>
<p>1) There is no severe pandemic and it's something political going on.<br>
2) They want people to die for whatever reason.  </p>
<p>Looking back I now realise both were true.</p>

        <p>Me too. The proposition of flattening the curve made some sense, but we had very bad overestimates on how fast this would blow through the population at that time.</p>
<p>In hindsight the 2 week number was never real and just a foot in the door for their over year long plans.</p>

        <p>For me it was a few weeks in... Maybe mid April 2020.</p>
<p>I was more than willing to do my part and #staythefuckhome (even shared that cringeworthy hashtag on Facebook)..</p>
<p>But as I noticed our local cases going up and the recoveries start, I noticed all of our deaths were by and large 80+ year olds in the same nursing home, and younger people were leaving the hospital quickly if they even had a severe case at all.</p>
<p>It was starting to go beyond a few weeks to flatten the curve, and restrictions were getting more and more ridiculous. Closing the beaches, can't go to the park.</p>
<p>As for vaccines, in the early days when I was actually scared of covid, I read alot about the reasons that they couldnt safely make a SARS or MERS vaccine, so I was skeptical at the jump that one could even be created at all.</p>

        <p>Just being aware of false media narratives in the past two decades. Being into holistic medicine (as in reading science articles about physiology and such, not chakras and such) and knowing how modern medicine is a cash grab that treats symptoms at best. Having worked with big pharma and knowing the types there. Reading about the spike protein and its action in the body 6 months ago. Seeing the inconsistent handling of the pandemic, and the lockstep narrative changes.</p>

        <p>when i saw how there used to be videos of people passing out and dying on the streets in china and in hindsight it was obvious propaganda. i remember seeing those videos in the past thinking nothing suspicious of it. that gave me complete confidence that there are people trying to deceive us revolving the pandemic, even if we might not know why they are trying to deceive us. the “why” is when the pure speculation starts, but it became absolutely clear that we are being deceived for a reason. i feel like this is important because most people think the skepticism is nothing but pure speculation and paranoia, but it’s extremely clear from what we already see with our eyes that there are people trying to maliciously deceive us.</p>

        <p>For me it was after my dad was hospitalized with Covid in April 2020. Every aspect of his medical care and patient rights were jeopardized during his almost month long hospitalization, and it was all justified by Covid mandates. This is when I realized the Government was making shit worse for us, not better. </p>
<p>Just a “quick” synopsis of my father’s shit care:</p>
<p>Dad was admitted to the hospital for what appeared to be an opiate overdose(dehydrated, disoriented, aggressive, in and out of consciousness). My family established Power of Attorney within 12 hours of his admittance, but his POA was not contacted for permission to vent my dad. We found out the next day they had put him on a ventilator, and had him tethered(tied) to his hospital bed by his ankles and wrists. </p>
<p>When I asked the nurse what they were doing for treatment she said, “the standard Covid treatment”. When I asked what that was exactly she told me to, “Google it”. It took us days to finally speak to his doctor, and we were told he was given a 3 day dose hydroxychloroquine (before it was taken away as an option). It hadn’t appeared to make any difference, so we started asking about other treatment options. The doctor said they don’t have one. We suggested giving him Zinc, vitamin C and D, as a “just in case” it will help, but we were told nothing can be given without fda approval. So then we start asking about plasma, and the family starts looking for plasma donations matches. The doctor tells us dad isn’t a good candidate for plasma. </p>
<p>It took us over a week to convince a nurse to hold a phone up to my dad’s ear so he could hear the voice of a loved one. It took us two weeks to talk them into turning on the tv or radio for him so he had something to listen to other than the beeps of his machines in the room he was isolated and all alone in. </p>
<p>My dad spent 20 days on a ventilator, and we almost lost him on more occasions than I want to remember. We spent these weeks begging for information from the hospital staff, and trying to assert our right as POA to advocate for his care. None of it mattered. Miraculously, my dad woke up, started breathing on his own, and was walking out of the hospital after day 26. Looking back, it’s hard to not consider the hydroxychloroquine as the reason for this, but it’s hard to know for sure. What I do know for sure, is that my dad’s long Covid symptoms are not from the virus, it is  PTSD from his terrifying time alone and isolated tied to hospital bed begging for nurses and doctors to come help him. </p>
<p>Point is, THIS is when I started asking lots of questions, and the more questions I asked the more ostracized I became. The more dismissed I got, the more cynical I became.</p>

        <p>Initially when the videos from China showing people dropping dead in the streets and vomiting blood got me worried, but by the time it swept through Europe and 99% of deaths was among &rt;65 age demographics, I knew something was terribly off. </p>
<p>And when they saw that they could reduce mortality just by <strong>not</strong> sticking people into artificial ventilation at their first cough, it became obvious that we were in the troll of the century, and the joke was on us.</p>

        <p>Around the time that emergency navy hospital boat left New York after only treating a handful of patients and when they packed up that makeshift hospital they built in Central Park. It really felt like “sorry, false alarm” at that point. Around that same time nurses were dancing and videos of mask shaming were going viral. It kept reminding me of the story of the boy who cried wolf, after a while there’s less and less reason to listen.</p>

        <p>I didn't really question anything until I was scheduled to have my vaccine last month. </p>
<p>I've always had crippling health anxiety so I had no problem staying at home. Even through the BLM stuff, I was angry because I thought the protestors would spread COVID. </p>
<p>I was going through a traumatic breakup and moved cities during Summer 2020. It's so weird though that I had no anxieties about COVID whatsoever in the airport but maybe I was distracted by personal issues. </p>
<p>I had emergency surgery for appendicitis in September and the nurses told me there was almost no COVID patients in the hospital. I just assumed we were flattening the curve. </p>
<p>I started getting my life back together this year and felt like coming out of a deep haze. </p>
<p>After looking up details about which vaccine I would get, I suddenly felt like I woke up. I'll never forget standing in my bedroom and having the conscious thought: 'wait... what am I doing?'</p>
<p>I don't care how crazy this sounds to most people. Honestly, I felt like I broke the spell of brainwashing in one short moment. </p>
<p>The next few weeks of research would confirm SO MANY suspicions that had been buried deep in my subconscious. There is still hope for so many people out there.</p>

        <p>When the media started showing all those masked people in China collapsing and blaming it on the virus without any word from the infected or the physicians that were treating them in late October/November 2019.</p>
<p>What most conservatives don't remember is that it was Mainstream and independent conservative outlets that were saying this was bigger than the Chinese government was letting on. Before I go any further, I want to state I'm apolitical so this isn't a knock on anyone who identifies as conservative. Anyway, they immediately started demonizing anything and all things Chinese, bashing the culture saying they're all dirty and unsanitary and that's why this is happening. THAT is were the ridiculous "bat soup" narrative was birthed.</p>
<p>I immediately knew something was wrong because the Chinese government isn't the only government that lies. The US government is the king of liars and does not honor the freedom of the people any more than the Chinese government no matter who's in office.</p>
<p>Finding out a major retailer here in Texas was working closely with the Chinese government on "How to handle the spread" in December set off even more alarm bells for me. It was around that time that the company I used to work for couldn't get the large orders of milk from the two major retailers we were working with and none of the store managers or regional managers knew why our orders weren't being filled.</p>
<p>As soon as the social distancing stickers were put LITERALLY everywhere over night along with the plexiglass a week later, I knew this was all bullshit and a coordinated effort by the world governments. This is why I didn't wear masks also because corporations have no business issuing health recommendations to it's customers. I knew this was a wealth grab and the "pandemic" was a means to steal from an unsuspecting public.</p>

        <p>I've never paid attention to the latest epidemic like H1N1, avian flu, ebola or whatever.</p>
<p>I say, okay some people will possibly get infected somewhere, but what's the point of living afraid?</p>
<p>So with this my reaction was the same. </p>
<p>Then they started by saying that masks were not necessary, to make them mandatory in just a few weeks. Wow, those people are entirely incompetent, they have no clue about what they're saying, or they have evil intentions.</p>
<p>Then when they started with the fear mongering, despite that the virus is not really that dangerous, that's when I said that this is just a bunch of BS being used for political reasons.</p>

        <p>After the first UK lockdown it became apparent that it was done when case rates were falling dramatically but you give the benefit of the doubt due to time lag</p>
<p>But the "rules" that were brought in were completely counter-intuitive and once they started calling every death with a test as a covid death and PCR scam became known it was obvious this wasnt about health anymore</p>
<p>Everything they have done since has only deepened my belief that its all a scam now, BTW i dont doubt there was a virus or it was of concern early 2020 but IMO the pandemic ended in April 2020 after an initial wave through vulnerable people, now its endemic and no worse than flu</p>

        <p>It was sucky. I've had worse but I was definitely sick. Same as recovery time for a flu I'd say. Lost my smell/taste for a few days. Fever. Achy. The usual. But the media had me convinced I was going to die due to my asthma and other health issues so when I didn't, I was shocked. Also, I should add that I was the only person I know who actually got sick after a positive test, probably due to those health issues. 🤷‍♀️</p>

        <p>I mean, I don't have any other answer but day one. I began not to trust that the pandemic itself was real literally the first day of the lockdowns. All the stores had all the appropriate branded floor stickers for keeping 6 feet apart literally the DAY OF the lockdown. I know people in the sign industry, and even if every single printer in LA was working 24/7, there's a 0% chance they all got it out on the floor by the next day. They were all created prior to the lockdown. </p>
<p>After that, nothing added up, and there was never any reason to trust any of their next moves. By the time the vaccine rolled out, there was never going to be any chance I'd ever take it. So yeah, I can say "before day one."</p>

        <p>I was concerned about COVID in the beginning. Like when stories were first emerging from China of people being borded into buildings and doctors speaking out being killed off. Me and my spouse began thinking they were covering a legitimate lab outbreak. The moment they began to talk about masks and the type didn’t matter and so called safety protocols did not match what would be necessary for an actual viral outbreak it became clear it was fake. When there was one set of rules for one group of people but another for the general public it became glaring obvious.</p>

        <p>Sorry about your grandma. </p>
<p>For me, it was when my school shut down, sending thousands of “potentially infected students” back home to their families. That didn’t make any sense whatsoever not to keep everyone right where they were for two weeks. If you have time to drive 100 or so miles and eat at a few restaurants and see a couple hundred people before “lockdown” starts, it’s not really a lockdown, is it? </p>
<p>I remember thinking okay, well I’m sure we’ll get the data from the US, China isn’t great at communicating so maybe their data is different from ours and we need time to see how it affects us. Then I sat down two weeks later and looked at the data and realized we weren’t in danger. Then every week after that. </p>
<p>As soon as the schools shut down, I began to fear for children who rely on the schooling system for safety, shelter, and food. Not to mention structure, socialization, and education. That was the worst possible solution to the problem and I was utterly disappointed in the governing bodies. Then as time went on I realized they don’t care at all.</p>

        <p>In the very beginning when reports out of China said people were being boarded up in their homes and that it likely escaped from a government lab, I was concerned. When our own government (media) began saying that there will be bodies piled in the streets and all but essential workers need to stay home, I started thinking. If it was as bad as they are making it out then they would declare Marshall Law and ensure no one left their house. There would be roadblocks and checkpoints to ensure people passing needed to be out. When I saw the list of who was considered “essential” it sealed the deal. I’ve not missed an hour of work since this fraud started and I am in the car repair business. </p>
<p>What I can’t believe is the people I’ve known all my life (56 years) have not questioned this at all. Some of these God fearing conservative people have bought in, hook, line, and sinker. This crossed party lines in my circle. I can’t believe the people I know who have gotten the vaccine. If you go to any of the pro vac subs you will read some of the most vile comments spewed. Many state they hope the people not vaccinated would just go ahead and die. I disagree with a lot of opinions but can’t recall wishing someone dead because I disagreed with them.</p>

        <p>I doubted it before this but in my area when it went through different demographics separately it seemed so scripted, first the ltc homes, then the migrant worker community, then the homeless people, then cross border medical workers, etc. The spotlight was only on one demographic at a time not all over the place like you would expect such a contagious virus.</p>

        <p>I spent years in culinary school learning science of viral transmission for the purpose of food safety. When the politicians started telling us to do shit that would spread the virus faster, I figured it out. All of the advise given was the exact opposite of what should have been done.</p>

        <p>I’ve never questioned COVID. It seems pretty clear that some arrogant assholes fucked up, leaked a virus from a lab, and have been panicking trying to clean it up. </p>
<p>As far as the vaccines: as soon as I heard they were using this opportunity to test a completely new vaccine technology (mRNA) I knew something was up. We simply don’t do that. We’ve never done anything like this before, because it’s insane. </p>
<p>Of course, that makes sense too in the context of the aforementioned panic and ass covering. This whole thing is a huge lesson in how incompetent “scientists” and our government officials are. Too made no one is really paying attention so they’re getting away with it.</p>

        <p>As soon as it popped into the news? Like 3 or 4 months before the lockdowns in the USA started. Never seemed any different than any other overhyped disease (swine flu, bird flu, west Nile, Zika, Ebola, etc)</p>
<p>I was absolutely astonished when people started buying into it this time instead of collectively rolling their eyes at the media fear porn as they had in the past. Then I realized that the fear of Covid basically ran straight down party lines and then I wasn’t as surprised.</p>

        <p>I have listened to David Icke for about 15-20 years and been interested in "conspiracy theories" my whole life. My dead father raised me to question everything. I know this all sounds cliche' AF. But, I think the more you are able to think critically, on your own, by observing things and noticing who is telling you something and why they are telling you to believe it, it gets easier to detect BS. Most of my family thinks I am a nutter prepper and anti covid vaxxer and that the United States government will not fall and blah blah. I hope to source that all these things are wrong. But it does not look that way. I would prefer to believe the illusions and BS. It is not fun, that is for sure. And who knows who is right and who is wrong? I am not taking the shot though.</p>

        <p>When the information on how deadly it was didn’t match the amount of people who were supposed to be dying. If you are in a pandemic you will know it. People you know will be dying. The fact that there’s a housing boom during a pandemic kind of tells on itself. It’s kind of like saying that a product is bad but somehow they can’t seem to keep it on the shelves of any stores</p>

        <p>So when they shut down the library, in March 2020, I had a phone call with my dad where I said the whole thing was a crazy overreaction. I distinctly remember using the word "hysterical". </p>
<p>Then I got somewhat sucked in to the propaganda coming out of Italy. Believed in the lockdowns from like April to June / July 2020.</p>
<p>What convinced me was reading Wikipedia actually. And the estimate that 130 million people would be pushed to starvation. I immediately (correctly) identified the cause as lockdowns.</p>

        <p>For me, I was questioning the response from the beginning.</p>
<p>First, when they were talking about bad stuff happing overseas, and democrats were calling trump racist/xenophobic for various entry bans.</p>
<p>Then even more when those same democrats shifted into full “we are going to milk this crisis for all it’s worth” mode immediately thereafter.</p>
<p>In terms of the measures recommended and implemented, I was down with the “avoid touching commonly used surfaces” because I’ve been doing that for years and it works. I was down with strategic handwashing, because that works too.</p>
<p>Where they lost me completely was the morning I went to a convenience store, and ordered a prepared burrito with a hash brown on it (made by them in their kitchen area, and served in an open top brown bag), and was told that they couldn’t do the hash brown—not because they didn’t have any, but because they weren’t allowed to serve food in an open container. That policy was obviously intended to apply only to the individual hash browns they usually kept by the register, but they were applying it generally, and in ways that made zero sense.</p>
<p>That lack of rationality pervades policymaking on this issue, and it’s a big part of why I’ve been fighting these battles since last spring.</p>

        <p>Spring 2020 my house and surrounding area was hit by a highly destructive and deadly tornado. It was like a war zone afterward. Not a single person had COVID or social distancing on their mind in the aftermath. That was a wake up call for me that there are real things in this world to be afraid of. </p>
<p>I became even more skeptical once I learned how liberally they define a “case”. A friend’s daughter was exposed to covid at daycare. A couple of days later she had some sniffles. Despite her and the entire household testing negative, they still counted her as a case because of her “symptoms” which were most likely allergies. At first I thought it was the local health department counting irresponsibly, but then when I learned that was the standard nationwide I started doubting the case #s. I also have an aunt who works in the COVID ICU and she said that they were putting out re-tests for their already positive patients as new case #s.</p>
<p>I was fully skeptical to the point of anger once I started thinking about all of the long term consequences of the lockdowns. Supply chain disruptions and the impact on third world countries, delays in cancer screenings, avoidance of medical care, mental health issues, etc. It was so obvious to me that in the long run more people would die from the lockdowns than the virus itself. Not to mention the consequences in the years to come for leaving so many kids alone and isolated at home with basically no functional education. Our society is so fucked.</p>
<p>I was never too skeptical against the vaccine. I definitely knew I wouldn’t get it until there was long term data available, but I understood why others, especially high risk people would want it. However, I become more and more skeptical now watching the blatant propaganda being put out now about the vaccine and delta variant.</p>

        <p>I was in Manhattan the entire year, this is the run-up to the lockdown:</p>
<p>COVID had already started spreading around the city before March, but they only had like 95 COVID tests manufactured.  So people who almost certainly had COVID were being denied tests, unless they basically had proof that they were in Wuhan eating bats and pangolins and those bats had tested positive for COVID.  When they actually ran out of tests, our clown mayor or governor would celebrate that there were no new transmissions of COVID.  The number of cases would grow in exact proportion to the number of new tests available.  In other words, COVID was here and spreading, before any restrictions were put in place.</p>
<p>So I asked a doctor friend who was on rotation in the ICU of a huge hospital, and she said they only had one COVID patient.  And no unusual influx of suspected COVID patients.  This is the point at which the panic buy and lockdown order happened.  </p>
<p>So the hospitals weren't seeing an influx, and there weren't tests to assess the number of cases.  This means the unprecedented restrictions were preemptive, and there would be no way of knowing if the subsequent influx of ICU patients 1-2 weeks later was inevitable, or exacerbated by the severe disruptions to everyone's life.  That's when I called bullshit.</p>
<p>Having everyone """isolate""" with their families/roommates in huge crowded apartment buildings, stressing them out, and forcing them all to shop at one grocery store or mcdonalds, never really made sense to me as a public health policy.  NYC had one of the worst death rates in the world, but Fauci lauded our response and Cuomo got an emmy, so next flu season we should probably lean into the restrictions even harder.</p>

        <p>ICU RN for nearly a decade. I've seen a few pandemics come and go since I've been in healthcare. Zika was going to get us!!! That turned out to be a wet fart. Ebola was going liquify our insides!!! It didn't. The list goes on. Needless to say, when word of CV started hitting the airwaves, I met the news with a healthy dose of skepticism.</p>
<p>Then, the lockdowns started. People began to panic, the media ramped up the fear porn to a fever pitch, and hospitals braced for impact with greatest plague humanity has ever known (!!!).</p>
<p>I should state, I work at one of the largest trauma centers in the U.S.. In short order, policies to handle covid patients were rolled out and several units shifted gears to become dedicated covid units. Then the covid wave came.</p>
<p>Although my home unit wasn't one of the dedicated covid units, I did get floated there several times to help out. People <em>were</em> dying but not in swathes like the media would have you believe. The people I saw getting hit were the old &amp; frail and the morbidly obese. Also, the overwhelming majority had multiple existing health conditions. </p>
<p>I made it a point to check in with friends working in the covid units to see if they were noticing the same about the covid population. They were. I frequently picked the brains of ECMO nurses who were caring for the absolute sickest covid patients we had. Their feedback was: not a one of their patients wasn't morbidly overweight or already living with one foot in the grave and another on a banana peel.</p>
<p>Among the peak months of the covid season I saw a large portion of coworkers from both ends of the cautious spectrum contract covid: from the ones that wiped down their entire workspaces religiously, wore n95s and face shields their entire shifts to ones, like me, who wore the minimum required PPE. Every. Single. Person. Survived. Every one of them took the required time off for quarantine and were back 2 weeks later, fresh faced and ready to go again.</p>
<p>My mother, who is in her late 60s, contracted it and said she felt like she had a light flu for a few days and then was fine save for her loss of smell, which took a few more weeks to fully come back. My father, who tended to her during that time, never contracted it (largely, I believe, because he contracted it back before the public was aware of what covid was).</p>
<p>I could go on and on, but by this point, my bullshit meter was spiking higher than a Geiger counter at ground zero, Chernobyl. While I don't deny people are getting sick and some are dying, if this thing was as deadly as it is supposed to be, it should have cut through hospital ranks like a hot knife through butter. I just didn't see it.</p>
<p>What I did see was people I once had respect for have their minds warped by a year of nonstop fear and propaganda, food service workers at the hospital get told to find a place with janitorial services or find new jobs because it was too dangerous to keep open the hospital's satellite cafes, and most concerning of all, authoritarianism reer its head in the name of public health and safety.</p>
