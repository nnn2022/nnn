    <strong>The hypocrisy of the large majority of lockdown and restrictions advocates.</strong>
    <p><p>Title speaks for itself really. The pure number of people who wander into a thread and say "don't be selfish" "just shut up and deal with it" "its for the better" is astonishing.</p>
<p>I'm willing to bet that if the tables were turned and say, they were being told they have no choice and have to go to work and, they can't wear a mask unless they work in a job that requires them to do so normally.if we were to say their common responses about selfishness and the greater good they would lose their shit. They would have started throwing bricks at cars and burning things in the street long before they even made a reddit post. </p>
<p>Equally If your reading this and can't respect another's human rights ( specifically the one relating to peaceful use of ones property being violated in the uk) by approving of the government working around respecting said right by creating laws at their whim, it can be assumed you also support the government doing so for all human rights. Since your freedom of speech is protected by your human rights, I assume you approve of that being taken away from you also. Since you don't want your own freedom of speech you can't really argue against anyone about anything since you don't support your own freedom of speech you've just admitted your opinion shouldn't be heard.</p>
<p>on that note thank you for reading this if your just here to down vote and share to other subs, hope your supporting of your right to disagree being taken from you has brought you amusement.</p>
<p>my advice, take live and let live a bit more literally from now on.</p></p>

        <p>These lockdowns have given the least productive members of society an opportunity to live for free with no expectation to contribute or to even support themselves financially.</p>
<p>figures why the majority of leftists are young people who are almost entirely supported by their parents, or people who choose a college course with little to no employability options afterwards. They're jealous of the people who planned their future cause they now work a minimum wage job cause they have no real skills and think its everyone elses fault.</p>

        <p>Of course, and why do they get so much love from journalists and the media. Who do you think those graduates of courses with very few work opportunities were friends with while they were in college.</p>
<p>The people we listen to on the news are just the 5% of successful journalism and media graduates. Almost all of which are being influenced by their old classmates into spreading what is essentially communist propaganda.</p>
<p>The socialists call themselves liberal but the moment you dare mention doing something they don't agree with entirely they fully support a heavy government influence and the moment a government does something they disagree with they have no respect for democracy and the legality, their first stop riot and destruction of property.</p>
