    <strong>“We never had real lockdown” is the new point to deflect from the damage caused by lockdowns</strong>
    <p><p>Many of us in the minority of us who opposed lockdowns from day one were concerned about the collateral damage that would be felt by the middle/ working class.  Of course we were all berated for daring to be concerned about our rights and livelihoods and told that rights don’t matter in a pandemic. </p>
<p>But now those same people are recognizing the immense economic consequences of lockdowns. They don’t want to admit they were wrong about dismissing concerns so the new argument put up is that “We didn’t Lockdown hard enough”.  If we did it right then everything would be back to normal. (Just ignore how the countries that supposedly did it right still have massive restrictions) This of course it’s to deflect the notion that lockdowns didn’t work and caused all this damage </p>
<p>I don’t get it basically every state had a stay at home order that was left up to them to decide. The governors got to determine what was “essential” and only they stayed open. So did they want the President who they claim to be Hilter Jr. to actually take authoritarian/tyrannical action to force 330 million people to stay home? Should we have been more like China and glued people in their houses or NK and shoot people who dared to step outside and break “Quarantine”. Does this whole “real lockdown” hinge on 100 percent compliance from 330 million people?  I won’t even go into how would people eat or society function</p></p>

        <p>People naively imagine some kind of situation where literally everyone is forced to stay inside except for maybe a bare bones hospital staff. These are people who don’t really understand how the world operates. They think the government can just give everyone money to live and drop groceries down in care boxes with parachutes. They don’t see beyond their own front doors or care to imagine that not everyone has their same life and can “lock down hard” for weeks.</p>
<p>Just direct them to a country with a heavy lockdown like New Zealand. Did it stop the virus there? No. Did they start lockdown nonsense again after smugly believing they were done? Yes. </p>
<p>Lockdowns were never in the playbook to deal with this kind of virus until this year. We got stuck on believing they were our solution out and it is a product of memes and nonsense that has been birthed in doomer subs and threads. People wrongly believe all kinds of stuff about lockdowns now and refuse to look at the actual data. The fact remains, no matter how theoretically successful you imagine a lockdown might be, it’s naive to think they can actually effectively work in a free society. We’re limited by things like human nature, rights, and the fact that we can’t legally (yet) hold everyone in their homes at gun point.</p>

        <p>From what I read China is very strict on what can be called a case or a covid death. They mostly require symptoms for testing and use lower PCR cycles on their tests. What a surprise that they've "beaten" the virus and are back to normal.</p>

        <p>I live in China and lockdown sucked ass and I won’t comment on how it effected people’s freedoms or mental well being but I will say it worked. A real ass draconian lock down worked. That’s how China is back to normal. So I agree, a real tough draconian lockdown for a month or so would help..I saw it work first hand. HOWEVER as an American I agree lockdowns infringe on our rights big time and they can have other unintended consequences. It’s a double edged sword</p>

        <p>Exactly,  </p>
<p>Incredible you have people dumb enough to start parroting "Yeah I adovcate a real tough lockdown that includes welding people in their apartment blocks, even when in China an apartment block collapsed killing people, that will mean that COVID will never exist ever again, it won't become a political kick-the-can game of starting and stopping and it will mean we will have a perfect future"  </p>
<p>Like.. How can you be so stupid? It's just that simple? The only virus we have ever eradicated is smallpox over decades with pharmacological methods but we can destroy a new disease just by staying inside and nuking the lives and wellbeing of everyone, it definitely won't just mean more cases later when we stop the lockdown?  </p>
<p>It's just incredible that people advocate for their own oppression and the oppression of their fellow citizens for absolutely no gain and total destruction because they can't even think clearly...  </p>
<p>Like seriously.. And nobody calls these people out on how dumb and destructive what they are saying is!</p>

        <p>Guess we did it wrong this time.</p>
<p>Next time we'll put everyone in straitjackets and leave them lying in their bed soiling themselves! That'll show 'em what a <em>real</em> lockdown is!</p>
<p>It's not hard to tell that these are people who are salaried and have others to do their menial tasks for them. Or they simply have no lives outside their front doors...</p>

        <p>Related to that, I also hate when some doomers claim "we never really locked down". I see it as gaslighting or the only way a lockdown can be a lockdown is if it's done like in Wuhan.</p>

        <p>Saying “we never had a real lockdown” is the same as saying “nobody has ever done socialism right”.  It’s complete BS and a cop out for people that don’t know what they are talking about.</p>

        <p>What the FUCK? My family was pretty much sequestered for 3 months except for a few trips to the store before we knew how much bullshit this was. Thankfully we live in the country and were able to get outside for fresh air and exercise. "Never had real lockdowns?" Suck it, you fear mongering pieces of shit.</p>

        <p>I posted this elsewhere, but it bears repeating:</p>
<p>&rt;"No True Lockdown"</p>
<p>We can <strong>never</strong> have a true lockdown. It's freakin' impossible.</p>
<p>We would need to have people prepare by buying at least 4 weeks' worth of food (to put you 2 weeks beyond the incubation period of the virus). Remember what happened when people thought we'd run out of toilet paper? How much worse would it be if we were talking about food?!?</p>
<p>We would need to shut down <strong>all</strong> business. No going out for a couple of batteries... no mail delivery... no ambulance in case of injury... no police in case someone breaks quarantine...</p>
<p>Someone will inevitably break quarantine.</p>
<p>Nothing could be built, repaired, etc. Your power or internet goes out, it <strong>stays</strong> out.</p>
<p>No food could be harvested. No milk could be... er... milked.</p>
<p>Etc. Etc. Etc.</p>
<p>Everything... and I mean <strong><em>EVERYTHING</em></strong>!!!.... would have to be shut down, and everyone would need to stay perfectly isolated.</p>
<p>It's an impossible standard, and therefore, no lockdown can be a "true" lockdown.</p>
<p>And yet... I've actually seen people argue for all of that.</p>

        <p>It's astonishing the excuses these people come up with. Even if a worse lockdown would have worked better at the beginning, an extremely dubious proposition, the window of opportunity for such a thing to be effective without destroying our civilization has clearly passed.</p>
