    <strong>Opinion: The Olympics should be stretched out to last the entire month.</strong>
    <p><p>Yes this is off-topic but I'd rather share it here than elsewhere...</p>
<p>But the Olympics would be a lot better from the audience perspective if you were able to savor it a little more.  Currently there is just way too much going on at once to be able get appreciate all of the different sports that are happening simultaneously.  The way NBC crafts narratives with various athletes, teams and countries makes it more interesting but they are restricted by the time available.</p>
<p>I think people would be interested in all sorts of different sports and good matchups if there was more time to comprehend the significance.  Shit, if we had my way it would be a full year of games every 10 years with winter games being the same 5 years after.</p></p>

        <p>l like this idea. Although time constraints can be a factor in determining who is the better athlete (maintaining optimal performance with less recovery time); from a viewer's perspective I think this would help ratings and also increase interest in the specific sports. I <em>do</em> wanna see how certain athletes progress through their events, but I'm not tuning in at 2am on a Tuesday to see how they fare. They could do certain events one month, then move onto the next set of events the next month. </p>
<p>However if I was a citizen of the host city and the games went on for a full year I'd probably lose my mind.</p>

        <p>Yeah, everyone seems to hate the idea of hosting the games these days.  I'm hoping for them to come back to Tahoe myself because I've always wanted to go.</p>

        <p>You could also just designate somewhere to be Olympic City which would avoid a lot of the headaches and construction etc.  People who live in Olympic City would be all about it.  Somebody needs to get us in touch with the IOC.</p>

        <p>Yeah I nominate San Francisco to be the new Olympic City. Reasonable size, very scenic, lots of hills for athletes looking to keep themselves in shape during the delayed progression of events, seems like a complete bullshit state of affairs there at this point; let's just start from scratch with that place.</p>

        <p>I'm 100% down for that.  I'll be the goddamn mayor.  We could have Tahoe be the Winter Olympic venue as well.  They are both too crowded for comfort already and the tech bros have been pretty vocal about never coming back into the office anyway so they can just peace out.</p>
