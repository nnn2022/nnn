<p>The take-away from this publication is that Covid does not correspond to any known epidemiological pattern, there was no epidemic until "they said so".  Once it was declared and the testing began, <em>only then</em> was there any "spike".  The "covid peak" was only associated to places that imposed lockdowns.</p>

        <p>Happy to help, the heinous amount of censorship is what drove me to start backing up more aggressively. There has always been some censorship but this has been taken to a whole other level throughout covid with the censorship of scientists, and that is something no one should stand for. That's not to say anything about this particular one, maybe his findings are all wrong, I'm not in any kind of position to say. But it should stand on its own merit, if it's all wrong, proper scientific scrutiny/process can determine that, not censorship by some corporate interests with some agenda to serve. Feel free to check out the rest of the videos on the channel and recommend any I've missed so I can add them. I also put a backup on <a href="https://www.bitchute.com/channel/LockdownSkepticism/">Bitchute</a> in case anything happens to LBRY.</p>

        <p>Covid was released onto the public sometime in October in EU, was in China by November and was everywhere in the world by January... I live in Vancouver, which has a massive Chinese population and averaged 174 flights a week from China before mid March. Considering it was in China since November, it was fully spread here by January, and yet we only have 170 deaths with a median age of 85 for the year. Fentanyl killed exactly 170 people in May 2020 alone. Fentanyl has killed 3x more then covid in BC this year, it's a joke.</p>
<p>The author makes excellent points and has a tremendous article, why did the peak happen at week 11? He mentions a massive spike after the WHO declared a " pandemic " and the global lockdown started, with the global media cartel going fear mongering 24/7.</p>
<p>Download the PDF, I'm reading into it right now, this guy debunked the whole covid thing. Has numerous links and articles on everything, this was very well prepared and he put plenty of hours and research into it...</p>

        <p>Thanks for the explanation!</p>
<p>I still have a feeling that nothing will change as far as restrictions and rules and enforcement anywhere no matter what is published.</p>
