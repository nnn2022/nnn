    <p><p>The founding fathers were ahead of their time and has the foresight to understand human nature and how power can affect people an corrupt them. They wrote down the consitution perfectly except for the ''state of emergency''</p>

        <p>I wouldn't say it's the <em>only</em> mistake. Immanent domain was a pretty huge fuck up and they should have been more clear with the phrasing of both the general welfare clause and the commerce clause. The federal government has been twisting the actual meaning of those clauses for ages in order to justify doing all sorts of unconstitutional things.</p>
