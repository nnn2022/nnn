    <strong>Portugals courts dismiss PCR tests as realiable and declare imposed quarantines on healthy people as illegal</strong>
    <p><p>Translated text: The Lisbon Court of Appeal ruled that the quarantine period imposed by the Directorate General of Health during the alert state is illegal. The ruling states that the body of judges ruled that such a situation can only be taken in a state of emergency (currently in force).</p>
<p>The decision was taken on Wednesday and is the subject of an appeal filed by the Regional Health Administration of the Azores following a habeas corpus request - immediate release - of four German citizens who had been forced by the health authority to comply with prophylactic isolation in their hotel room.</p>
<p>In fact, under the Constitution and the law, the health authorities do not have the power or legitimacy to deprive anyone of their liberty - even under the label of 'confinement', which effectively corresponds to a detention - since such a decision can only be determined or validated by a judicial authority, i.e. the exclusive competence under the law that still governs us, to order or validate such deprivation of liberty, is assigned exclusively to an autonomous power, the Judiciary," the ruling states.</p>
<p>Thus, the judges of the Lisbon Relationship add that any person or entity ordering such deprivation of liberty "is making an illegal arrest".</p>
<p>The Regional Health Authority, says the Lisbon Appeal, is not one of the constitutionally valid entities to decree deprivation of physical liberty, and none of the tourists in question "has even been seen by a doctor, which is frankly inexplicable, given the alleged gravity of the infection".</p>
<p>The court also notes that the RT-PCR tests on covid-19 have a "reliability that is shown, in terms of scientific evidence (and in this field, the judge will have to rely on the knowledge of experts in the field) more than debatable".</p>
<p>The tourists in question had filed a writ of habeas corpus, which was validated at the end of August in a decision by the Judicial Court of the District of the Azores, which, the president of the Government of the Azores, Vasco Cordeiro, said at the time, had not taken public health into account.</p>
<p>It's a decision that, of course, being a court decision, must be respected, but it's a decision that clearly doesn't take public health into account," the head of the Azorean executive declared at the time.</p>
<p>The court decision, he added, was "about the validity of an approach" defended by the national health authority and that followed the recommendations of the World Health Organization itself, namely those concerning the isolation of people infected with the new coronavirus.</p>
<p>The tourists in question, said the Azorean court and corroborates the Lisbon Relationship, were "successively deprived of liberty in two hotels on the island of São Miguel," where they arrived on August 1 from Germany.</p>
<p>In their country, in the previous 72 hours, they had "carried out a test" to determine if they were carriers of the virus that originates covid-19, and the result was negative.</p>
<p>The citizens gave copies to the Regional Health Authority at Ponta Delgada airport. On August 7, two citizens performed a second test and the rest did it three days later.</p>
<p>One of the women gave a positive result and, according to the court, "they were all given a prophylactic isolation order signed by the Health Delegate of Lagoa, from August 8 to 22, but which remained in execution" on the day of the decision on the 'habeas corpus' request, Wednesday (26).</p>
<p>For the court, the decision of "deprivation of liberty issued by the Regional Health Authority was based only on normative circulars issued by the Regional Health Authority and by the Directorate General of Health" that "constitute non-binding administrative guidelines for the applicants, but only for the aforementioned authorities and their chain of command.</p>
<p>The Judicial Court of the District of the Azores points out that the requesting citizens "have never been transmitted any information, communication, notification, as is due under the European Convention on Human Rights, in their mother tongue".</p>
<p>This was not an isolated case in the Azores, since on August 14 the Azorean District Court ordered the release of two citizens who had filed a 'habeas corpus' after they were quarantined for traveling in places close to a covid-19 infected person.</p>
<p>Also on July 27, the court decided to declare a 'habeas corpus' filed by three citizens "deprived of their liberty" since July 24 in a hotel unit on the island of Graciosa under covid-19.</p>
<p>On August 5, the Constitutional Court found that the Azorean authorities violated the Constitution by imposing a mandatory 14-day quarantine on those arriving in the region because of the covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The decision followed an appeal by the Public Prosecutor's Office (MP) to a judicial decision to release a man who complained about the imposed quarantine.</p>
<p>After the decision of the court of first instance, the MP appealed to the TC, but the judges of Raton Palace considered, in the decision dated July 31, that "all the disciplinary rules of a right to freedom or guarantee require prior authorization of the Assembly of the Republic," a requirement that "takes on particular relevance when it comes to compressions or conditions to a right.</p>

        <p>The RT-PCR test is misuse and samples are over-amplified which means instead of a virus you have a bunch of artifacts. It happened right at the beginning back in January. You can see it here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7045880/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7045880/</a></p>
<p><em>Real-time RT-PCR</em></p>
<p><em>Reverse transcription was performed at 50°C for 30 minutes, followed by  inactivation of the reverse transcriptase at 95°C for 10 minutes. PCR  amplification was performed with</em> <strong><em>40 cycles</em></strong> <em>at 95°C for 15 seconds and  60°C for 1 minute using an ABI 7500 Fast instrument (Thermo Fisher  Scientific).</em> </p>
<p>In the method they used 40 cycles of amplification on a subject with symptoms where a high virus load should been present. And that means it should been detectable with fewer cycles. 32 I would say are more than enough theoretically and even less. So why they over-amplified it?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/jwd9f0/here_in_the_us_labs_are_running_between_35_and_45/">https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/jwd9f0/here_in_the_us_labs_are_running_between_35_and_45/</a></p>
<p>And as you see the same methodology is going on today. They must know that is incorrect.</p>

        <p>Title should read: "Portugals courts dismiss PCR tests as  <strong>unreliable</strong>"</p>
<p>And for damn good reason. These "tests" are no such thing. They are for manufacturing pieces of a virus, or other such proteins, not detecting a live virus. </p>
<p>The failure rate is absolutely abysmal and they should be banned from being used as "tests".</p>
