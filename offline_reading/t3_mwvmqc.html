    <strong>People are too afraid to talk here about anything, with the system 100%</strong>
    <p><p>I feel so alone. I find myself withdrawing from people. The now going into two years of isolation has affected me badly. I am on the autistic spectrum and depended on groups for social interaction. Now one group sent a weird questionaire asking if people were willing to meet with other vaccinated people.  Already the shunning as begun.</p>
<p>From what I can tell the vaccinated believe the vaccines work like "old" vaccines, and give immunity and prevent transmission. I tried to warn a few people but it was for naught. Outside of 3-4 online friends who are into a bit of conspiracy everyone lined up for the vaccine. I even wonder if a few friends respect me, once close friend [maybe not that close] completely ignored me to go get the vaccine [for his job] and the job let him go recently.  I said you don't have to take it for a job, he lived in a red state where it never would hold up. I talked to someone who had bad effects from the vaccine, nerve ones with tingling and gave them a few links, and said, rethink the second dose. They don't want to talk to me, I can tell. I gave them only science stuff, Bosse, Open Vaers, no conspiracy, they did not want to know. I have been shut down more times then often. I think they probably will go get the second shot. I will leave them alone. I did not judge them.</p>
<p>There's no one to talk to. With most people I did keep my mouth shut, but feel like I am living superficially, I see a few people on Zoom but not in real person except husband. There's no groups to go to. I have no family [long story]. I don't have in real life close friends and the people I am around unless I am just talking about "nice" stuff like a bit of art or formal topics in a lecture, don't want to know. I never knew a person could end up so alone in life. At least I have my husband. I always thought something was wrong with this place and town and burst out crying over leaving my rural town of 15 years ago. At least there a few people were capable of a real conversation. I could not talk husband into moving. </p>
<p>I was invited over to dinner by a vaccinated person in one organization, never been to their house before, and I got the feeling they too believed the vaccine made them totally immune in passing the virus on, or getting it, and they wanted to have a meal open eating etc. They are a nice person but I thought they probably think I have gotten the vaccine and I worried about pressure to "get it" if they knew otherwise. Maybe I am dumb but I got worried about all the spike protein shedding, I notice patterns and when so many people talk about something happening in random places, it could be a real thing. I hope I find out it's not true but for now I want to err on the side of caution.</p>
<p>I turned them down and made a rain check, but there's part of me not wanting to talk to people lately because I have been shut down so often.  I fear saying the wrong thing to those who believe so whole-heartily in the system.</p>
<p>I am scared of my doctor now he's so pro-vaccine but there's a doctor shortage here. </p>
<p>I sounds like some of you have lives around people who question the system, and at least think like you do. I don't. Even the conservative Republicans here [on the richer end] all lined up for the shots, I know a bunch in a book club I am in. I do not know one person in real life who questions this.</p>
<p>I do want to move but husband is not keen on it, that's a problem.  So many people shut me down, I am glad he listened to me on the vaccines, but I worry about others ebbing that away if that makes sense. I feel so silenced and shunned and shut down.</p>
<p>There's no one to talk to about this stuff except online. I never in a million years thought there would not be a few free thinkers around me. People who have bad stuff happen from a vaccine and still want to sign up scare me too.</p></p>

        <p>Go out to a bar and spark up a conversation with a stranger.  It could be liberating for you.  You dont have to talk about vaccines and the world's problems.  We dont all bear the burden of changing minds.  Take your mind off the worlds problems and enjoy the moment and focus on yourself.  The first step in breaking the cycle of isolation is to step outside your comfort zone and start re-engaging.</p>

        <p>I did start going out to more stores but that provides little opportunity for conversation. I don't know if our bars are open or not, could look but they were closed a long time. All clubs, classes and everything else has been shut down on Zoom. I am trying to make Aspie friends via a Zoom. I do need make some more real world friends. I would feel more comfortable around unvaccinated people who don't buy into this crap but am open to others.</p>

        <p>Yeah I am going to more stores. Even being high risk, there's a point I have to go out and I am doing a few more things now.  I only see and talk to other people on Zoom besides husband. I was happy to find out one of the Aspie people is into conspiracy maybe they see through this crap.  Yeah a lot of Zoom is limited, with whole group watching it doesn't get as personal.</p>

        <p>Thanks glad someone relates, I am tired of nothing but compliant zombies. I can tell I am being shut down by the very few I have tried to talk to. Invalidation and shame. I guess if I feel antisocial there's a reason.</p>

        <p>Tell people you had corona already and your doctor said due to current health concerns he advised you to not get the shot. So you get the oh you had corona sympathy and oh man it really messed you up and since the doctor said you can't get the shot you have a trifecta there.</p>

        <p>Yeah everyone thinks I am crazy. I have only spoken out to a few safe people but there is that patronizing thing. Now I do not think some were as safe as I thought. I don't trust the one male close friend anymore. I seem him as having a "weak character", he had the means not to sign up for the vaccine with his job that let him go.</p>
<p>I am out as an Aspie in some groups so there's a little bit of subtle discrimination going on here. I tested with a higher IQ when young [have friends in Mensa] but get the feeling they think I am "deluded" and falling for "misinformation" because of my disabilities. They don't realize how much I read or that one reason I am still alive is I researched rare disorders for one that took years to get diagnosed and I read pubmed, research studies etc with ease.  I think humanity is going to be screwed.</p>

        <p>Don’t be too hard on yourself. It seems like you are in tune with your feelings. Stay positive, be kind, negativity attracts more negativity so the best place to start is within. We are all one ultimately.  The mask is intended to sever the human connection, so that loneliness and isolation is probably a result of that to some extent.</p>

        <p>Thanks. I will try to focus on hobbies and doing stuff with husband. I will try to stay nice, I think I am going to drop the Covid topics, been shut down by too many. I warned a few I felt safe in doing so but it went badly so I can only do what I can. I hope I do find out the spike protein shedding is not true, but I can go to outside events, with masks for now. I agree it has severed human connection, and that has impacted me. I am almost deaf too and the masks made me completely deaf with no lip reading which heightened my isolation to the mask. I have a transcribe phone and it works great on zooms and appointments but a person has to be seated closer to me.</p>

        <p>I think so too. We basically are having the bioweapon war happening now, the elites have made the decision for depopulation, changing the chessboard, etc. The Deagle numbers were right. [I used to be heavy into conspiracy and bible prophecy when I was a Christian fundamentalist, I deconverted, however I am against the vaccines spiritually too, even now, and am realizing things I used to warn about have come true] Thanks for the invite.</p>

        <p>I think he is afraid, we have a hard life and live on the economic edge, even affording a decent apartment is not easy I wanted to move back to our rural town years ago but he didn't want to, there were difficulties of course. He understandably got tired from starting over [economic survival, we saw our old small rural town basically collapse in the late 2000s, there were abandoned houses next to our apt building] This place is more affluent, but the people here are very much of the system in their privilege and it blinds them too.  Yes They are programmed to obey.  I have tried to figure out how does one find like minded people on a local basis? I have realized I am never going to be close friends with anyone who believes in the system. I can manage casual friendship and good acquaintanceships but nothing deeper there. It did grow the loneliness.</p>

        <p>Its tough.  I think youll have to make a different plan to move ack out eventually but the downturn might be everywhere.  The international elite is harsh on anyone who rejects liberal dogma.  They sold us lies 30 years ago too and I came to not mind cities. But that time is gone and now they have more rural reach.  You'll need to hook up with a group thats no nonsense, who has potential to go beyond pleasantries and see what is feasible where youre at and as far as more sympathetic souls.  Maybe others who plan to move back out eventually.  I dont imagine any city pastors are worth speaking to offhand but you never know.  Maybe someone who runs a co-op or bazaar would know someone, like that.  Or if you scoured the web already, maybe look in a slightly different area or category.  Kind of thing to go as a couple then if its good you can link up on your own too.</p>

        <p>I worry the downturn will be everywhere too. Everyone we know, I am a progressive [disaffected now] where 90 percent of the people we know got the vaxx and believe in the system  but our social circles are liberal ones. However I do live in a red area, of the otherwise blue state.</p>
<p>I think husband is of the opinion we know this place best so survival would be easier rather then getting used to a new place.  He may have a point, we need the medical care that is here for both of us and some other assets.</p>
<p>I know there ARE some conservatives here. I think I need to figure out ways to meet them and expand social circles. I see neighbors that don't wear masks, etc. I think our rural areas are far more questioning. We had a neighbor who refused to wear masks, that my husband was talking to but he moved out to another place. </p>
<p>I also have got the inkling that African Americans distrust this crap more and we have a friend who had family members get seizures.  I know there's got to be some other people against all this crap.  Yeah I do need some groups that are nonsense and go beyond plesantries, one problem when we moved here, the culture was so much more closed mouth and self contained, the real conversations seemed to vaporize. I've gotten kind of repressed, I think this could do more with social class--this area is far more affluent except for the inner city area, and outlying rural areas. Before everything went pear-shaped I was hanging out in a few rural small places before  all this but with all events shut down that's not as possible.  They do have more rural reach. I think even most of the churches got co-opted, I was in fundamentalist churches for years before I deconverted. I lost some friends over that deconversion but wish I had some of them to talk to again.</p>

        <p>This is pretty much what the syndrome is for those who don't have neighborhood history in cities and must have to do with the societal engineering and urban policies. This is what they did in the past twenty years and it affected all types.  It has the effect of making dissent scarce, since most won't look beneath the cosmetics and théy dont question what the demographic results mean or who pulls the strings.  You'll have to see who is speaking against covid measures near you and then who follows them, and then you'll find more who are cautious about it (since they can't put a solution to work on their own or are wary of surveillance).  It's ridiculous how they shut down or required masks outside the cities and we all know it.  The thing with church is you can probably find someone or her family to go with occasionally that would be more like visiting for possible outside networking but it's hard to say where would be many freethinking members.  There are definitely some that resist though and even read up on these events without going into extraneous speculation (heard a few preachers and priests about it last year visiting radio shows).  If your husband will join you maybe you could start a new group to attract people that hate what has happened and have pulled their kids out of school and also need new networks.</p>

        <p>I told the stamp club I would wear masks but I still do being high risk, but I am glad I made the decision now to tell them not to force vaccine passports basically on the club. We have been socially engineered not to have close ties. Families ties broke down to nothing. I don't have a family and they were abusive. It seems everytime I found community in this life, I had some via a music and art co-op in my old rural town, it gets broken down and everyone esperated. This Covid shit has basically destroyed freedom of assembly and yes I am afraid too, but now as a disabled Aspie there's no place to go meet people. Oh I did go in the library the other day at least but they wiped away so much. I agree with you all the social engineering has taken a toll and the social engineering of Covid is advanced. Churches don't operate the same way, they are pretty controlled. I am in a liberal church now but when I was a fundamentalist, it was pretty controlled, and I got in trouble often for dissenting from certain viewpoints. At least now among the liberals I can believe freely without imposed creeds but the church world is no bastion against the encroaching totalitarianism from what I have seen. I was in hard core IFB churches too. The last IFB I was in mocked I and husband for money problems and believed in the system and called for war with Iran and I walked out. Maybe there's a few dissenting priests and pastors out there. I hope so. My liberal church sadly has bought into the entire Covid narrative. It's hard, these are folks I care about too but I see very bad things coming for them health wise. I wish I could find a few friends, I can really talk to who see through it all. I will do my best to try and figure out where the freethinkers are but it's rough. I know some are afraid to talk much too now.</p>

        <p>The other suggestion is naturopaths or people who are into that but have more of a highbrow approach not hippies.  Sometimes those types have a mix of conservative but openminded or at least gave the impression.  I can't believe it but I agree in some areas the people who we might have thought to be leading skeptics are not as vocal anymore.  I liken it to when researchers try to publish studies that get retracted for political reasons.  Eventually they don't bother and funding is denied.</p>
<p>Truth be told, a lot might have to move underground and hope everyone who objects to the government-corporate abuse can adapt with that inconvenience.</p>

        <p>I was in shock there wasn't a few naturopath types in my liberal church but maybe they are afraid and are keeping their mouths shut.  Yeah some will be a mix of liberal and conservative. I think fear is silencing a lot of people. Even to warn the few people. I felt afraid. Hell even writing a stamp club I live 40 miles away from, felt scary.  I think a lot is going to have to move underground. I worried about my isolation here and close local friends, I really needed some close local friends who questioned all this crud.</p>

        <p>Those who have never felt days of agony before might be in shock.</p>
<p>Those who for the first time in their lives started wearing masks for hours a day are brain damaged and the rest didn't totally get it even when they admitted we might be right when we told them the govrnments were declaring war on citizens in the guise of addressing a virus.  </p>
<p>You must remember there are plenty of resisters around who have lowered their expectations but you will find them at the periphery of conservative groups most likely.  I really do wonder about liberal churches, can you try to see if new arrivals with wider experience or rural roots are open to these kind of discussions?  Then your small group could find a fitting forum if your club isn't quite the thing anymore.</p>

        <p>I know some said I may be right but then marched on doing what they were told. I think there are resistors who are keeping silent out of safety reasons, even I have picked or chosen where to open my mouth. My expectations are massively lowered. I guess I have made the decision the vaccines are a hill I will die on, because the vaccines would kill me anyhow and I have spiritual beliefs regarding the vaccines. I could see if new arrivals are open but I have noticed the young millennials have listened more to affluent boomers in the group who are very pro-vacc. It troubles me how young people at little risk with Covid had lined up so willingly. I do not understand it. I get the feeling people are used to things turning out or take their good health for granted. I've had one of those kind of lives I've seen too much but maybe it helped me escape the matrix.</p>

        <p>I think you will find there are lots of people on here who relate to you, its just a shame you have no one to talk to in your life about it who doesnt feel the same way. </p>
<p>I have a friend who who has Aspergers Syndrome, and though I love her dearly, she has taken this whole Covid thing very seriously and abides by all the Covid "rules". She recently had her second vaccination and felt the need to post on fb to all her friends and family, that she would no longer be willing to meet with anyone for the forseeable future who is unvaccinated. Which includes me. I PM'd her and asked if we could meet wearing masks, as she is a dear friend to me, but I was told it would not be possible, but that we could still carry on our friendship via messaging/phone calls etc etc. I know people with Aspergers are very black and white, they cant judge that their behaviour could possibly upset another person, and they arent always able to sense emotions that others without Aspergers do. Her logic is that she is protected from strain, whilst I could pass on many to her. I did question her over how she expected to live her life from now on, unless shes lives in total isolation forever more, as people she comes into contact everyday wont be wearing badges of honour to say they are vaccinated. For example, work, church, shopping etc etc. But I never really got a straight answer on that. But it made me sad, and also made me worry, how many other people will start thinking this way? The vaccinated shunning the unvaccinated? Its a very scary thought</p>

        <p>Could you tell your friend that the vaccines don't prevent transmission or provide immunity? Yeah I feel bad for you. yes the vaccinated are going to shun the unvaccinated, I may write the stamp club and write that some people have health and other problems where they do not desire the vaccines and it will be unjust to do a "vaccine passports" kind of requirement on people. I may even write that the vaccines are experimental. Some Aspies I am friends with online have all lined up, people who are middled aged. One Aspie friend is conservative and into conspiracy and she has refused, we are closer online friends but I think even in Aspie circles we may be the exception. Some aspies are more likely to question the system so sorry your friend is not among them. I did try to warn a few closer online Aspie friends not to take the vaxx but few listened.  I think people are thinking this way already and it's scary.</p>

        <p>Awww, thank you for the reply. My friend is very very very stubborn, and I think for me to broach on the fact that the vaccines dont prevent transmission or provide immunity would just push us further apart. One of the things I love about her is she does have a heart of gold, and is very trusting and naive, which makes her a very nice person but has often been her downfall. That our government (Boris Johnson) would be dishonest towards the British public is something she would never comprehend. I cant change the person she is, and though her actions have upset me, the best I can do is be there for her as virtual friend when she needs it :(</p>
