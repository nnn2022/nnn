    <strong>The Society Collapse that is Coming. Explained in depth, you must be prepared. MUST READ.</strong>
    <p><p>When I mention societal collapse, I want you guys to envision those cinematic apocalyptic/post-apocalyptic worlds. Think scenes similar to Divergent, Hunger Games, The Purge, the Walking Dead, etc etc. (Also, I think the reasons these kind of movie genres suddenly became so popular is because it is their own fitrah warning and speaking to them, but they dismiss it off as their imagination).</p>
<p>There will be no government, no hospitals, no jails, no schools, no public services, etc. Anarchy. It will be complete anarchy. Just look at now. What is #defundthepolice? It is a step towards anarchy. These people really think it will do them good. How much are they in delusion?There are gradual steps to get to the climax of it all, but we’ve already entered the beginning stages.</p>
<p>But way before that point, what you’ll witness is a militarization of the streets. Before the government completely fails, they will order Martial Law, meaning the government/president is no longer in control, but the power has been shifted over to the highest ranking official of the military. The U.S. is already preparing their military with drills to combat their own civilians during civil unrest (Google search: Jade Helm)</p>
<p>(It's its trailer of a controversial independent movie that was to be made by a man named David Crowley. He was a US military veteran that wanted to warn people and illustrate the chaos that he envisioned soon to come. He was threatened for the idea of this movie, but he, his wife, and his 5 year old daughter were later all found inside their homes dead before the movie was even made, and the media claims that he supposedly killed himself and his family).</p>
<p>Civil unrest will increase because there will be such a shortage of food and water so poverty will everywhere. There will be even more protests and riots than ever before with people demanding the most basic living needs. How true is this? Just look at the state of the world now. This pandemic is only the start of the shake and collapse of the economy. It will only get worse unfortunately. Many are in denial of this.</p>
<p>Right now, a good percentage of U.S.A population is incarcerated. When the security systems fail, all the ruthless inmates who have been locked up (many unjustly) will escape, fill the streets, and angrily fend for themselves. Now how true is this? Many prisoners have been released due to this pandemic. </p>
<p>Once the military runs out of weapons and supplies, the soldiers and officers will have no reason to keep working and it will turn even more into every-man-for-himself. Nafsi, nafsi. Yes that will be the state of the world. </p>
<p>2 Main reasons:
1) Environmental reasons
2) Economic reasons</p>
<p>1) There is something called peak oil To summarize, the world is running out of the oil supply to meet the demands of the population. When this happens, there will be never be modern technology as we know it again. Also, not only are we running out of oil, we have completely destroyed the sustainability of our planet (Search deforestation, palm oil production, endangered honeybees, dead top soil, radioactive oceans, Californian drought, overpopulation, pollution, etc).</p>
<p>2) The Debt ceiling is bound to collapse. Our current monetary system is nothing but a Ponzi scheme built off of interest and wealth redistribution. We are in tremendous amounts of debt with the interest increasing every second, and it’s impossible to reverse it or pay it off. The only way to end it is for a drastic economic crash to occur, which will be the biggest one ever in history. It was suppose to happen generations ago (we saw a glimpse of it during the 2007 economic crisis) but politicians and leaders have only found ways to kick it further down the road. There will come a point where we’ve reached the end of the road and the whole banking system will collapes. Your $100 bill will mean nothing, it will have as much value as your childhood fake boardgame money. This is the reality of the future. Keep staying and hiding away from the reality.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other reasons and explanations I could include, but I feel like this is enough for now. All I can advise is wake up. Wake up to the truth and reality. Staying in delusion can take you only so far. </p>
<p>My last post here was not that long. But this time around I went in depth. But no! The Low IQ here wont even be able to comprehend this. Jfl to these people when they think gov actually cares about us. No. We are fked from all fronts. This is just the reality.</p></p>
