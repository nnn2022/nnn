        <p>Details:</p>
<p>I pulled this story from the Calgary Freedom Central page. I and many others have known for some time that the top "Walk for Freedom" organizers are in fact controlled opposition. I'm happy to see more people waking up to this and taking actions to expose this infiltration in the freedom movement. It's time for us to move forward from the drama they have created.</p>
<p>The “Freedom Bullet” Experiment</p>
<p>An interesting story is coming out of Young Guns Canada today, a Calgary based site teaching responsible gun ownership. The site’s founder has been a regular at the Prince’s Island rallies known as the “Walk for Freedom”, which are organized by a group known as Freedom Unity Alliance (FUA).</p>
<p>He states that he recently started getting suspicious of the FUA leadership’s motives, based on observations and widespread suspicion among the freedom community that they are involved with controlled opposition forces. Upon witnessing their attempts to sabotage the World Wide Rally for Freedom last week, he decided to set up an experiment of his own.</p>
<p>He decided to go to the “Drive for Freedom” on Saturday that was organized last-minute by the FUA group to overlap the World Wide Rally happening at Central Memorial Park. At the event, he handed out deactivated dummy rounds to the attendees, calling them “Freedom Bullets.” He handed out to attendees only the two kinds of rounds shown in the bottom of the attached image.</p>
<p>To the FUA organizer that was present, he gave the round shown in the top photo with a copper head. She is the only person he gave this type of round to. Within hours, a photo of this round was being shared on twitter accounts run by Antifa (controlled opposition), and then 660 City News ran a story on it by Saturday night, using the photo from the Antifa post.</p>
<p>He believes this to be conclusive evidence that the FUA top organizers are in fact part of the controlled opposition to hinder the freedom movement in Alberta. The full account of this story can be found on the Young Guns Canada facebook page.</p>

        <p>That's pretty damning evidence, OP.</p>
<p>Handing out "freedom bullets" at a time when TPTB would just love mass civil unrest (if not civil war) very much has a <a href="https://i.4pcdn.org/pol/1560822148941.jpg">hey-kid-wanna-blow-up-a-federal-building</a> air about it.</p>

        <p>Typical misdirection agent. He handed it out and the organizer for FUA leaked it. They are controlled opposition</p>

        <p>He gave them something he knew would get reported
and planted a marker to track the flow of the information.</p>
<p>I knew something was up when the Antifa bullet was different then all the others people were showing off on their social media.</p>
<p>It's an old technique so find leaker's and spies.   Marking bills,  marking documents, having multiple versions of documents and see which ones end up where.</p>
<p>Give them candy and watch to see where the wrappers fall.</p>
