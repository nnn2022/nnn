    <strong>I feel like I‚Äôm suffocating</strong>
    <p><p>I am having a hell of a time this weekend, with my work being closed for Thanksgiving. I need some socialization and entertainment in my life, and all that I can really do is go to a bar. While I enjoy alcohol very much, I am craving going to a sporting event or concert, and doing something besides simply existing in my house or being at work busting ass, since I‚Äôm ‚Äúessential‚Äù.</p>
<p>I had some plans with friends over the last few days which got cancelled for various reasons, and normally I‚Äôd be fine with that and go to a store and look around or something. But that is no longer fun either. Wearing a mask into a store is annoying, and completely ruins the experience. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs cold where I‚Äôm at, so outdoor activities are limited at the moment. I need something, anything to escape from this. Will we ever be able to do things without hearing about the damn Rona again? Cause it‚Äôs killing me mentally to continue to sit inside with nothing to do.</p></p>

        <p>In my state the big news will come in the beginning of February, all is silent right now as covid-ism is now about to consume December and Christmas with it too. You can go outdoors still be just bundle up though I know it's a hell of a lot less fun. Seriously the latest thing I just got into was studying mushrooms and fungus because it's all over out there and there's not much else going on but even that would be anything too interesting till Spring. After that I got nothing, I just sit around and have a couple digital projects to work on, and often I barely have the energy for that anymore because there's no drive coming from anything else and any I have is usually sparked by my morning coffee that I need to use wisely because when it wears off so does the motivation.</p>

        <p>Hi, it's a real bummer that your friends cancelled and there are so few ways to get a bit of relaxation anymore. It has become a hassle to hunt down things to do that aren't stained by the rona as much. I hate the cold too, but I did find that at the start of December, a big park near me will hang up holiday lights for people to look at all month. Some people at the park ignore the rules about masks, etc, at least in my area. </p>
<p>If you don't find anything suitable between the dystopian indoor things and cold outdoor things, I've also found escapism a little bit helpful, like fantasy shows, or making my own worlds in the Sims. I know those things are still bittersweet, though, seeing show or game characters socializing normally. I'm really sorry that there are no truly relaxing options anymore. It's down to choosing the least sad thing, pretty much. Hang in there.</p>

<p>It's so f-ed up that people who don't have to work <em>can</em> socialize, since they can isolate between visits or include other households in their "bubble," but the people who do have to go to work to serve them can't.</p>

        <p>The big problem I have with this is that people who are at home think that the people that do have to work to keep the world going don‚Äôt need an outlet to enjoy themselves. </p>
<p>I work at a lumber yard, and this year has been the craziest in the 100 plus year history of my company because of people wanting to do home projects. I leave work sometimes absolutely defeated by the idiot customers I deal with daily, or clenching my jaw from stress from it. It would be nice if people realized that ‚Äúessentials‚Äù (god I hate that term) need a break to do something fun or release pent up frustrations. But obviously the Rona is apparently the only thing that is of concern to anyone anymore üôÑ</p>

        <p>Exactly. The people who don't work (or work cushy reduced hours from home) <em>do</em> get outlets, and the people who <em>don't.</em> And somehow the people at home think this is perfectly fine, and that they are on the side of justice and right. It's not quite like slavery, but it's certainly like some kind of really messed up caste system.</p>

        <p>I went grocery shopping yesterday. I wore a gaiter in the store (which is the most mask you will get out of me) and it made me sneeze and my nose itch the whole time.
