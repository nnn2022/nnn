    <strong>Med Student Here, Hmu if y'all have questions</strong>
    <p><p>Medical student here. Also have research experience. (I'm saying this as an appeal to authority, lol prolly not gonna work, but I do have the education to personally verify the science behind the big boy recommendations). Feel free to check my post history, not a shill, or a bot, just a regular ass dude. Feel free to DM me if you need further confirmation that I am not beholden to anything besides myself.  </p>
<p>One of my longitudinal preceptors let me see the covid floor (part of the hospital converted for folks on ventilators). I have to sit through meetings where they show us data of epidemiology shit, super boring. I'm part of the community of people who make recommendations and decisions about the pandemic.  </p>
<p>(1) Its real folks.<br>
(2) It can kill you.<br>
(3) If you aren't vaccinated, you are rolling those dice.<br>
(4) I got the Pfizer myself, felt shitty for a whole week, like super exhausted. Still worth it.<br>
Get vaccinated y'all. Vaccines do have risks, but they are minor. This delta variant shit is scary. If you are unvaccinated, and have health concerns, you have a decent chance of getting your shit rocked by this thing.</p>
<p>You have the right to choose for yourself. That being said, in my opinion, not getting vaccinated is a really shit decision.</p>
<p>I get that some of y'all think this is a government power grab. This doesn't have to be a hill to die on. If you are passionate about personal choice and liberty, get the vaccine because you want to increase your chances of being alive, keep your community alive and well, and to live to fight another day. If you care about how much the government is involved in our lives, get involved, express your frustration. That being said, if your personal doctor recommends you do something for your health, prolly do it. We aren't trying to fuck you over. It bums me out that it seems like people have become so tribal, that all forms of 'authority' are getting lumped together. It's like, either you believe in all: scientists, epidemiologists, climate change, health experts, or you believe in none. Bros, it doesn't hurt to be diligent, and not lump all our asses together. </p>
<p>Your doctor probably doesn't care more about the 'culture war', then about your health. Leave us out of this shit lol.</p></p>

        <p>Not smarter. Just have a different background and education.</p>
<p>Education =/= intelligence</p>
<p>Do you think your mechanic thinks he is smarter than you when he figures out whats wrong with your car, and offers advice on what you should do? Nah. He just spent a long time figuring out how cars work. My dad was a mercedes mechanic. If I had a question about those, I would trust his advice on it, because thats his area.</p>

        <p>So then you are aware that "viral genomes" are created by computers right?</p>
<p>This is how they discovered "SARS-COV-2" by assembling RNA fragments from samples with multiple sources of genetic material using an algorithm.</p>
<p>&rt;RNA extracted from <strong>bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid</strong> and <strong>culture supernatants</strong> was used as a template to clone and sequence the genome. We used a combination of Illumina sequencing and nanopore sequencing to characterize the virus genome. Sequence reads were <strong>assembled</strong> into contig maps (a set of overlapping DNA segments) <strong>with the use of CLC Genomics software</strong>, version 4.6.1 (CLC Bio). Specific primers were subsequently designed.</p>

        <p>See my comment explaining why this isn't 'computer generated'</p>
<p>My analogy is this.</p>
<p>Imagine Covid-19's genome is a single 'picture'. We can't just see it yet though, sequencing genomes means we have to gather the data on each individual nucleotide in the sequence.</p>
<p>The scientists are then going to cut the picture up so that it can be sequenced.</p>
<p>The illumina technology 'scans' all of the puzzle pieces. It literally reads light that corresponds to which nucleotide is at a given location.</p>
<p>Once the data has been gathered, an algorithm fits all the pieces back together into the original image.</p>
<p>The computer didn't "create" anything, it just worked very hard to figure out what the original image was, by being clever, and scanning little pieces of the big picture, and then putting it back together.</p>

        <p>There is no original, they are piecing together small fragments against another "known" (also computer generated) "viral genome" that they say is related, even though at that point they have no idea what they are sequencing other than a loose morphological assessment that not even the "experts" can agree on.</p>

        <p>I see what y'all are getting at now.</p>
<p>It's easier to figure out where the puzzle pieces go if you have a similar image.</p>
<p>They are still using the 'scanned pieces' from their own samples. The similar image makes it a heck of a lot easier to find out where the pieces go.</p>

        <p>My guy. This is my area of expertise. I think you may misunderstand what is being said there. It isn't that the computer 'created' a new life form or anything like that. What you pasted is generally how newer sequencing technologies work. They take the original sequence, and then they read many smaller parts of it, and then put it back together by findings areas of overlap. I'll explain in detail below.</p>
<p>The big takeaway is that the 'algorithm' isn't creating anything new, its just stitching together whats there.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Detailed:</strong></p>
<p><strong>RNA extracted from bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid</strong>-&rt; The rinsed out some lungs with fluid, and took then extracted the RNA from that fluid.</p>
<p><strong>and culture supernatants was used as a template to clone and sequence the genome.</strong>  -&rt; "culture supernatents" means they grew stuff in the lab, then harvested it</p>
<p><strong>We used a combination of Illumina sequencing and nanopore sequencing to characterize the virus genome.</strong> -&rt; Illumina is a next-gen sequencing technology, its super cool. There are some neat youtube videos that show how it works. The TLDR of it is that it creates lots of short 'reads' of DNA it is sequencing.</p>
<p><strong>Sequence reads were assembled into contig maps (a set of overlapping DNA segments) with the use of CLC Genomics software, version 4.6.1 (CLC Bio). Specific primers were subsequently designed.</strong></p>
<p>-&rt; This is how next-gen sequencing works in general. Not just for covid. Your original sample of DNA is fragmented into lots of tiny pieces, which are then 'sequenced' by the machine, and then the 'algorithm' finds areas of overlaps between all the fragments, and puts together the original sequence.</p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<p>Original = <strong>AGC</strong><strong>TCG</strong>TCGTCTGCATCGATCGATCAATATGCTAGC</p>
<p>Fragments (reads tons of short parts of the original sequence)</p>
<p><strong>AGCTCG</strong></p>
<p><strong>TCG</strong>TCG</p>
<p>Algorithm (finds areas of overlap, puts it together)</p>
<p><strong>AGCTCG</strong>TCG</p>

        <p>They don't know what those short fragments belonged to, they have never truly isolated a virus and extracted just it's RNA or DNA. I know they aren't creating an organism or in this case an alleged pseudo-organism, they are creating a theoretical genome that has not been shown to exist in nature.</p>
<p>Edit: also if they had the "original" already there would be no need to sequence it again. Your explanation is nonsense.</p>

        <p>I feel like there are two separate issues here, that are getting lumped together.</p>
<p>(1) Is the vaccine a good idea?</p>
<p>(2) Is this issue a hill to die on, and symbolically important for my larger ideals?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'm not sure about (2), that is for you to decide for yourself. But from the medical standpoint, (1) is a solid choice.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'm not suggesting anybody force you to do anything. I'm hoping that you can trust your doctor to offer you the best advice he is capable of giving.</p>

        <p>I have natural immunity from having already been infected earlier this year. I’m good. </p>
<p>Even if I weren’t, I’m a healthy, active person in her 20s. My chances of hospitalization and death from covid are extremely low. So why would I risk adverse effects from an mRNA “vaccine”? You can tell me the effects are “rare” as much as you’d like. They aren’t. </p>
<p>My friend’s 17 year old nephew was hospitalized for myocarditis after getting the Pfizer “vaccine”. My post-menopausal neighbor now has a period again. My sister’s coworker had a seizure the day of getting injected. And my brother’s friend said he lost his hearing right after the shot. </p>
<p>Also, you’re speaking as though those in the medical community are all on the same page. There are countless medical professionals and scientists who are speaking out against all of this. I’ve said it repeatedly, so long as these doctors are being censored I will not even CONSIDER getting the shot.</p>

        <p>I mentioned this in another one of my posts on this thread, but I am in a similar boat for my own health.</p>
<p>I'm healthy, in my 20s, and am very unlikely to end up hospitalized or dead from covid.</p>
<p>That being said, it looks like the virus may cause some long term organ damage. We will know more over time. I wouldn't risk heart damage, or brain issues. The vaccines do have some risk, but its super lower.</p>
<p>I'm part of a large group of med students. We didn't have serious adverse reactions, and our overall community is huge. Not a single one of my classmates had any serious issues. Thats been my experience.</p>

        <p>The “vaccines” don’t prevent you from getting or transmitting Covid. </p>
<p>So no one can avoid the unknown risks from Covid (and that’s only if they happen to catch it), but I can avoid the unknown risks from a shot. </p>
<p>Regardless, anyone who’s genuinely concerned about covid can just take ivermectin as a prophylactic treatment.</p>

        <p>The risk for organ issues is directly proportional to your 'viral load'.</p>
<p>Basically how 'out of control' the virus gets before your immune system shuts it down.</p>
<p>If you are vaccinated, you can still become sick. However, you are likely to recover fast, and minimize the risk of it causing damage.</p>

        <p>You can see my other post. When you say affect our genes, I assume you mean: "Can this vaccine integrate itself into our genome"</p>
<p>Nah. To put this in perspective, when a virus inserts itself into your genome, it has to convert its mRNA to DNA, then get that DNA to the nucleus of the cell. None of that shit is possible for an mRNA piece chillin by itself. The tools just aren't there.</p>
<p>It's fate is just to make it into the cell, chill for a bit, get transcribed, then destroyed.</p>

        <p>Jesus homie. I gotta get back to studying the hypothalamus here in a second. You are popping off.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>To be honest, this isn't really my area of expertise. I don't really care much about public health or epidemiology shit.</p>
<p>You can look the data up for yourself and reach the same conclusion I do.</p>
<p>The data shows the people who are infectious who wear a mask reduce how much they spread it to others. There is also some protection if you are not sick, and are trying to avoid becoming sick.</p>
<p>Best I can do without really going hard in the paint.</p>
<p>Me personally, I don't wear a mask when I'm around folks I know who are vaccinated, and I don't wear one in most public spaces. That might change here if delta variant gets high enough in my area, and if the Pfizer vaccine I have doesn't cover well for it. Oh, I do still wear masks in clinical settings though, always, standard stuff.</p>

        <p>You can pull up the statistics for each vaccine, and how effective they are for each of the new variants of Covid.</p>
<p>My thought process is this. Yeah sure, if you are vaccinated you can still get sick. That being said, you are still massively improving your odds.</p>
<p>In your case, if you can, try to find some data on how people who have natural immunity are holding up against the new variants. It isn't impossible to think that you might benefit from a vaccine that targets a different portion of the viruses proteins.</p>
<p>Lol you basically made your own vaccine in your body. Tbd on how well it holds up against the variants. I hope it offers super solid and broad coverage for your sake.</p>

        <p>Yeah I looked at it. Makes sense to me. Not much benefit to the vaccine if you have already had Covid.</p>
<p>That being said, I will keep an eye on the variants over time. That may not hold true as things continue to develop.</p>

        <p>My background from undergrad and research was molecular genetics. I worked as a TA for genetics, and worked in a molecular genetics research lab for about 3 years.</p>
<p>Your question can be broadened: What is the long-term effect of a new medical technology?</p>
<p>The answer is obviously we won't know for sure until we have the data. However, someone like myself who understands the fundamentals of the biology and technology can make a pretty damn good educated guess.</p>
<p>My thought process is this. How does the mRNA vaccine compare to the more typical protein based vaccines? Well, delivery is different, we have to deliver it into cells with lipid droplets. The other difference is that it has to be transcribed into the peptide. Beyond that, there really isn't a meaningful difference in how they work. Do either of those things have a potential to be super dangerous? </p>
<p>Delivery: for me this seems to be the most dangerous part. Not my area of expertise. Seems like from the literature there are some risks associated with liposomal drug delivery, but these are more short term risks. I have a hard time imagining much immune risk potential, but again, not my area of expertise. The fact that horrible short-term outcomes aren't common is a reassuring thing in this case.</p>
<p>Transcription Requirement: This really shouldn't matter, the mRNA is not going to magically get converted into DNA, move itself to your nucleus, and insert itself. That little shit is just going to stick around in your cytosol, get transcribed, and degrade.</p>

        <p>lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation can cause mental health and cognitive issues, sterility, and clotting, right?</p>
<p>I'm no physician, and covid itself can cause these issues due to inflammation, but the lipid additive seems like an additional risk. </p>
<p>as far as your initial impression that people here lump all authorities equally, idk if that's the case or not, but I know that I get lumped in with "racist, xenophobic, white supremacist, selfish, alt-right, trumptards" for not wanting to be  involved in experimental treatments. Aside from that, I have Ulcerative colitis, and I've been told to kill myself for not wanting the vacks (more than once).  Tribalism certainly is an issue, but I hope you're highly aware that it's going both ways right now.</p>

<p>Second article: transposons are also irrelevant here. Transposons are possible because their sequence includes the ability to jump around. The mRNA we are adding here doesn't have that, and also isn't DNA.</p>

This has nothing to do with culture war, stop dragging out that tired, old straw man to beat up. This has to do with my survival. If I get Covid, I’ll try some ivermectin along with some vitamins. I’ve gone a year and a half without catching it, I think I’ll be alright.</p>

        <p>Here I am my g. I'm a real guy. If you were sitting next to me, and you could look me in the eye, I have a hard time imagining you would have the same attitude.</p>
<p>Vaccines do have risks. Not getting vaccinated is much riskier when it comes to covid.</p>
<p>Would you vaccinate yourself against a virus that is extinct on planet earth, if the vaccine has a 0.0001% chance of killing you? Of course not. The tiny risk isn't justifiable when there is no benefit.</p>
<p>On the other end, would you vaccinate yourself with a vaccine that carried a 1% chance of killing you, if the disease it protected you against had a near 100% fatality rate, and was spreading like wildfire? I'd fucking get it.</p>
<p>My point is this. Yeah, vaccines carry some risk. Don't let people tell you otherwise. But its a calculated decision about whether or not its worth doing. In this case, its worth doing. The risk is small, and the protection offered is well worth it.</p>

        <p>You have that right. That being said, if your doctor advised you to do a surgery, and your own research led you to a different conclusion, what would you do?</p>
<p>In medicine, we don't force people to do anything. If you want to walk out that door, it's pretty much impossible for us to stop you.</p>
<p>That being said, it scares me when folks ignore the best advice we can give, because they feel confident in their own research over our educations.</p>

        <p>(1) First off, not a poli sci dude, no idea.</p>
<p>(2) Vaccines don't protect you 100%. Depending on what vaccine you get, and what variants are in your area, your chances of getting infected vary. That being said, vaccines massively cut down your odds of getting sick. Moreover, if you do get sick, you are way less likely to die or get super sick if you have a vaccine.</p>
<p>(3) For your third question, I posted an answer somewhere else in this thread. I will paste it here.</p>
<p>"My thought process is this. Yeah sure, if you are vaccinated you can still get sick. That being said, you are still massively improving your odds.<br>
In your case, if you can, try to find some data on how people who have natural immunity are holding up against the new variants. It isn't impossible to think that you might benefit from a vaccine that targets a different portion of the viruses proteins."</p>
<p>(4) No idea about the common flu thing. Haven't even heard that come up in my circles.</p>
<p>(5) Also no idea. Not a public health guy.</p>

        <p>You didn't hear white house secretary Jen Psaki tell the world that 12 individuals are spreading dangerous misinformation? She failed to say these were Md's and Phd scientists. These ppl are all calling it an illegal bio weapon. These ppl are known as the disinformation dozen. Just go read what they have to say. You are completely 100% wrong in you're opening statement regarding the safety and efficacy of these vaccines. Go read up on the Thomas Renz lawsuit filed im Alabama. Just bc you made a stupid mistake for yourself doesn't give you the right to hide it under an education.</p>

        <p>Good analogy.</p>
<p>When you roll the dice on having a vaccine bad outcome, the chances are extremely low.</p>
<p>When you roll them on covid, your chances of dying if young are extremely low. That being said, for me personally, I don't want to risk any long-term issues from the virus on my organs. Not a dice roll I am willing to take.</p>

<li>Yes, it exists on GISAID, EMBL, GenBank and GitHub.</li>
<li>LOL.</li>
<li>You mean like injecting rushed, poorly tested mRNA/rDNA so-called vaccines into your bloodstream without knowing the future consequences?</li>
<li>Death, SJS, TEN, myocarditis, pericarditis, etc are just minor risks indeed.</li>
<li>Delta is indeed scary if all you do is listen to the MSM, but when you look at actual data and peer-reviewed evidence, you see that it is actually less virulent than the previous OuTbReAkS.</li>
<li>Yes, government tyranny IS a hill to die on.</li>
<li>The idea that getting vaxxed keeps the community "alive and well" is asinine when we both know that they are using a leaky vaccine that neither prevents transmission nor infection. </li>

        <p>&rt;Vaccines do have risks, but they are minor. This delta variant shit is scary. If you are unvaccinated, and have health concerns, you have a decent chance of getting your shit rocked by this thing.</p>
<p>This is a wholly emotional argument. As someone who has been a part of scientific, academic, research, this argument means nothing and I find it hard to beliebe someone who claims to be a scientist would argue like this.   </p>
<p>Provide proof of your claim as a medical student, or at the very least make an argument based on logic, not emotion. Then we can talk.</p>

        <p>Our sentiment is that debate on COVID-19 and the equivalent vaccines were patronized at best or suppressed at worst. What justifies the shutdown of the world on a virus that 98% of the population survives? IMHO a real epidemic would not have any virus/vaccine skepticism. I want economic effects considered because everything has an opportunity cost</p>

        <p>You can look at the geographical distribution of where vaccination rates are high, and the corresponding covid rates.</p>
<p>Its clear that they are inverse. Good enough for me.</p>
<p>As far as variants go. Thats evolution. The strains that can get around the vaccines/natural immunity, are the ones that can spread. Thats how all diseases evolve.</p>

        <p>Well, consider how it looks to smart people outside of the medical industry.
1) the pharma industry has fucked up regular medicine for a long time prioritising long term msintenence medications over cures e.g. benzos for depression vs psilopsybin
2) ivermectin, a cheap effective medication for covid is actively suppressed by big pharma via regulatoty capture.
3) a radical new medical technology is foisted on us via mandatory vaccine passports as the only solution when a handfull of people are on hospitals via covid
4) top sceintists are censored off of twitter+ facefuck and gluetube
5) the media and medical establidhment gives us bullshit nutrition advice and closes health promoting activities such as gyms, saunas and even beaches snd parks in the name of public health</p>
<p>Please address each point in turn.
If you cant smell the bullshit off of big pharma get the fuck out of medicine.
I quit a medical profession because of the bs previously and am now frozen out of another profession as i dont want to take some experimentsl vaccine and you know what. The truth is sweeter than wine. Eat well, exercise and sleep. That is all most people need to do.
Most meds are bullshit. You know it. I dont trust pharma as far as i could throw the poisonous snake oil merchants that they are.</p>

        <p>Why are you equating big pharma to doctors? Not the same thing my guy. Different people. Sure sometimes they overlap, but in general not so much.</p>
<p>(1) Very complex issue. Yeah I don't like big pharma either. I'm no expert, but we agree that they suck.</p>
<p>(2) No idea what ivermectin is, again I haven't been on social media much, and it hasn't been discussed in my circles</p>
<p>(3) I think you can do a better job of making this into specific questions. This is more of a statement. </p>
<p>(4) Again, I haven't been on social media much. This seems like an issue that I don't really know anything about. Sorry my guy.</p>
<p>(5) Not my area. Nor is it the area of your personal doctor. I'm not qualified to say anything meaningful about what the right thing to do was or is for stuff like that.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"Most meds are bullshit"</p>
<p>This I feel more comfortable talking about. Bro, there are many drugs that are super effective. Beta-blockers are kickass drugs, that help out people with atrial fibrillation, clean drug, great result. The chemotherapy we use for leukemias are kickass, and people have great outcomes. There are also tons of mental health medications that have changed the quality of life for people with serious illness from 'needs to be institutionalized', to a functional life.</p>
<p>Sure the pharm industry is shitty, but that doesn't mean every drug thats ever been made is snake oil.</p>

        <p>I posted elsewhere in this thread, that having a population where a virus is actively spreading, and part of the population is vaccinated is a perfect storm for mutations to pop up that can infect vaccinated folks.</p>
<p>In that sense, it does help to reduce the risk of new variants popping up if we drop the prevalence of the virus down by getting as many folks as possible vaccinated.</p>

        <p>How many times can a single mRNA strain produce spike proteins before degrading itself?
Is it true that a single shot contains tens of trillions of strands? 
In comparison, how many virus does a traditional vaccine contain?
What happens to the cells after the spike are produced? Once in the bloodstream, in which tissues/organs the mRNA deposits? Is it possible that among the huge number of spike proteins that surface the cell walls, some can escape and deposit anywhere in the organism, leading to unknown and future problems?
How long does the spike protein survive in the body if it's not attacked by antibodies?
Why has the vaccine such issues with blood clots ?</p>

        <p>Sure.</p>
<p>Not sure on the dose level of the mRNA vaccines vs normal peptide vaccine.</p>
<p>The peptide itself shouldn't stick around for very long. Proteins degrade through a couple of pathways. It depends on how quickly they are marked for destruction. I would say an upper limit of a few days.</p>
<p>I can't think of a mechanism where the protein could do any harm to the body.</p>
<p>As far as blood clotting goes, I'm not sure.</p>

        <p>Thanks.</p>
<p>I was particularly curious about the number of proteins a single strand can produce. Is it random or is there a fixed number?</p>
<p>Also I'm curious if the artificially infected cells can be anywhere in the body, included organs.</p>
<p>About the proteins, I read this study where they suggest the spike protein alone can be harmful, as it behaves like it's natural counterpart (chapter 6). If true, the vaccine might be a big mistake as it basically does exactly what it should prevent. Then the immunization is because the people literally survived the infection, not because their immune system was safely trained.</p>

        <p>nearly missed answering this one, my b.</p>
<p>I don't know about ivermectin or HCQ.</p>
<p>As far as Zinc, Vitamin D, from my own research they seem to boost immunity. I take vitamin D daily, and have Zinc on hand for some illnesses. Careful with zinc though lol, I found out that sometimes people can lose their sense of smell, thats a trip.</p>
<p>Boosting your own immune system is a great idea. I see nothing wrong with it, unless you are damaging your health with what you are taking.</p>
<p>As far as why vaccines are necessary? There is an upper limit on how much you can boost your own immunity. You could do everything right to take care of yourself, and happen to get infected with a virus that your body can't handle. It's smart to develop antibodies against viruses, and vaccines are a solid way to do that, that goes beyond just boosting the immune system in general.</p>

        <p>Ideally, we get the population vaccinated to a level where the disease doesn't spread itself fast enough to be sustainable, and where there aren't a ton of people sick with Covid who can mutate and infect immunized folks.</p>
<p>The problem now is that we have a lot of vaccinated people, and a lot of people still getting sick. That creates a perfect environment for variants to pop up. Covid is abundant, and mutating overall at a high level, and there is a juicy population of immunized people that those mutants can then jump too, and begin spreading again.</p>
<p>Look at India's variant problem for more info.</p>

        <p>Nah.</p>
<p>Let me state this with an analogy.</p>
<p>Right now, everyone with a vaccine is almost like a new species for Covid to hop too.</p>
<p>When people are sick with the original form of Covid are constantly around people who are vaccinated, it becomes more likely that mutations that allow infection of vaccinated folks will 'jump', just based on proximity and how illness spreads normally.</p>
<p>Vaccines work, but when you have a large number of vaccinated, and unvaccinated folks rubbing shoulders, it creates an environment not totally unlike a wet market in china, where a pangolin and a bat are chillin next to each other.</p>

        <p>I'm in my late 20s and have been offered a seasonal flu jab for the past decade or so through work but have never had one as I've not felt it was necessary. Why should I apply a different risk assessment for Covid-19? All I hear are the same arguments as with the flu jab, but hardly anyone in their 20s takes that, because it poses them such little threat. The death rates for Covid-19 in my age group are miniscule. I know it's a 'triggering' thing to say, but if you're young, fit and healthy, it's just the flu...</p>

        <p>Viruses are annoying to diagnose based on symptoms alone. In general, they cause a lot of overlapping symptoms.
