    <strong>Toxic trolls here &amp; how to block them in 2021</strong>
    <p><p>For well over a year now I've wasted a lot of time responding to incredibly rude people here. You know the type: Lockdown-enthusiast mask-loving internet trolls.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can spot them quickly from their rude tone and name-calling. But other times they bait you in with the illusion of being here for honest conversation - but it's never real. As soon as you counter their TV talking points -- out comes the abuse. The name calling. The profanity and general rude, attacking behavior. That's all they have. But sometimes it elevates to following you around from subreddit to subreddit like a weird internet stalker, and occasionally they even try to track you down in real life. Win an argument, gain a stalker. Seriously, these people aren't worth engaging with.</p>
<p>At first it's no big deal, but after a while it can build up and the negativity might drive you away from here. Don't let that happen!  This is one of the few places people who are skeptical of the "New Normal" can gather on the Internet with relative freedom, and being around sane people is important right now in a world where so many of our friends and family have been turned into germaphobic authoritarian lunatics.</p>
<p>My point here is -- these people aren't worth your energy. Their minds aren't changed by debating with them, so it's just a drain on your energy and time.</p>
<p>The answer:</p>
<p>You can block these people. It's faster and feels a lot better than spending time on someone who comes here with nothing but fallacious nonsense and hate.</p>
<p>Reddit has made it a little harder than it used to be, but you can still do it and no, you don't have to report them first.</p>
<p>Here's how to block these people if you're using a web browser:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click your profile in the upper right corner</li>
<li>Click "user settings"</li>
<li>Click "safety &amp; privacy"</li>
<li>Type or paste their Reddit name into the "Block New User" box under "People You've Blocked"</li>
</ol>
<p>In the past I might have said, "Don't block people. Talk things out with them." But that doesn't work with these people. Anyone here that calls us names or is otherwise abusive is just here to make you feel bad and drive you away from your NoNewNormal peers.</p>
<p>The lockdowns, threats from our own government, coercive vaccine policies and masks are enough negativity in our lives. These people aren't worth it. Blocking them is a quick way to get them out of your lives and really, <em>it feels damn good to make them disappear.</em></p></p>

        <p>If you are not aware that many people are here simply to demoralize you, you will continue to suffer needless damage as you will be failing to comprehend just how evil some of these people can be.  It's well beyond narcissism for many. </p>
<p>As for the simpletons, forgive them and move on.  </p>
<p>Do not tolerate guilt by association to their "hate groups".  Ignore,</p>
<p>Alternatively, call them the true bigots that they are, and dont give them any reasoning other than quoting them.  you own them nothing.  watch them implode.  makes for good fun</p>

        <p>Thanks. Yeah, I just realized the time I spent replying to the people that come here was a waste.</p>
<p>They are disingenuous at best, and downright hateful at the worst... but nothing useful ever comes of it.</p>

        <p>:) its okay, sharpens the skills.</p>
<p>there are two things to bear in mind, imo, when choosing to respond:</p>
<p>1) what good from a potential reader get from me countering this message?  could pointing out something possibly red pill someone?</p>
<p>2) counter-demoralization</p>
<p>anything other than that on home turf is succumbing to their tactics.</p>
<p>Trust me, this is absolutely a war to many sorts of people, and while it's necessary for you to spend the time you did to realize that and learn other things via experience, you are correct in saying you don't want to waste the time stuck arguing with them.  especially here.  its different when out in the normiesphere picking fights with a cnn comment monitor</p>

        <p>If you get the Reddit Enhancement Suite, it makes it even more fun.  I mean, if you have time.  If you don't, it saves time...  </p>
<p>Just take a look at what i did with some new dickhead that just suddenly showed up and is posting demoralizing comments everywhere.</p>

        <p>heh heh</p>
<p>i heard that its really good, that enhancement suite</p>
<p>honestly i'm on this sub and like 2 others, i really dont like to spend much time on reddit cuz its soul cancer, but here cuz its a good aggregator of news and stuff against lockdown.  </p>
<p>best way to win against these people is to post things that demoralize them, btw.  when they come here to troll and they read you laughing at htem, they seethe, seethe, seethe.  its your best weapon</p>

        <p>I JUST posted something similar... however, don't block them.  They will still be here and you will get confused about some of the discussions that occur.</p>
<p>Get the Reddit Enhancement Suite and you can tag them...  then its just downvote and move on.  Or troll them if that is what you like to do and have time.</p>

<p>Yeah, that first number you see there is how many times i've downvoted that idiot, altogether.  The second is Reddit's downvote counter in that thread.</p>

        <p>That's about how I used to handle it, although 'blocking' is new to me.  Thing is -- not once in all this time has any of these conversations resulted in anything positive.</p>
<p>These people are lost, and they think the same about us. For them, the programming is so deep that there's no way to get through to them.</p>
<p>The other side got them first with fear, and second through politicization. By politicizing it, these people stay lock step with the agenda even as it becomes more and more clear this was all about something else other than the virus.</p>

        <p>Yup. It's never a discussion with them, it's always an argument. They basically think they're doing the right thing morally and we're somehow wrong and evil.</p>
