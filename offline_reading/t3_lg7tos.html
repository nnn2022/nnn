        <p>The point of vaccines is that you get LESS sick than you would normally and your odds are better with the vaccine than without.</p>
<p>It means that you can go back to work after the two weeks of the vaccine being with you. You’re supposed to be able to relax slightly because you’re vaccinated and if all your friends are too then you are a safer group! If me and my friends had the vaccine and a month passed, we should be able to resume our lives. We’re the best prepared we can. We might have to wear masks to use stores in Canada here but once we get the vaccine and have it work in our body for the two weeks we are still the best shape for fighting it. Don’t worry about Grandma she’s going to get the first dose after health care workers and first responders. I am 32. I am so low priority in the vaccine design that it’s going to be almost the whole year before I or anyone younger that’s not elite getting the vaccine. Imagine having to survive longer trying not to get sick because of the vaccine plan that they have decided. Fuck I am glad I don’t have to work during this as in <em>I have no choice in it, especially at minimum wage</em> because dying for Wendy’s or McDonald’s pay ain’t worth it dude!</p>
