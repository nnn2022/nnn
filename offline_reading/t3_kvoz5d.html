    <strong>communism</strong>
    <p><p>why has this whole lockdown and covid thing turned everyone into a far left communist???? i’ve seen a rise in communists online and it just seems to be high schoolers and middle schoolers that don’t understand anything. i just don’t understand the desire to not want to work for what you have. i cannot wrap my brain around that for the life of me lol. I’m a fan of the government not being on my back, individuality and freedom to make your own choices and from everything i’ve seen and researched on communism, there seems to be none of that. The canadian government is trying to condition their people into thinking communism is the way, it’s not. There is a woman in Calgary whos from communist China who is protesting against it in Calgary every weekend. She is pleading to Canadians to not let communism come to Canada!! She knows how terrible it is and all these 15 year old ACAB fools think that they should just get shit handed to them. They all probably worked at mcdonald’s then collected a government cheque and thought, “communism is the way” like give me a fucking break.</p></p>

        <p>Your watching the CCP win on a global level that the Soviet union could only dream about.
Clinton in 90s said opening trade to the CCP would help bring democracy to China. All It succeed in doing was bring communism to the rest of the world and now the genie is out of the bottle and there's no putting it back.</p>

        <p>My parents fled from communist Russia they're both fearing for this country because they see the signs on the walls. I always say if communism was so great why do people flee it for countries like the US? Not the other way around.</p>

        <p>the thinking is if you are going to lockdown, you must pay people to stay locked down. UBI, or whatever you want to call it, is a shift towards the dollar becoming worthless and later on, communism.</p>

        <p>Well, how many people felt that way when people could get a good union job with a high school degree, raise a family on the money with one income, own their own home (that used to not be a far off pipe dream), have a decent work/life balance that allowed them to connect socially and have leisure time...</p>

        <p>This whole ""Pandemic"" is polarizing and making things glaring obvious now. There is a long chain of events and policies that led here. Neoliberalisation, Obama &amp; Clinton both having <em>strong</em> communist influence around them set up the education system and let big corporations dominate everything including government, low minimum wage, influx of immigrants, gravitated media spitting out a single narrative (or false dichotomy), etc.</p>
<p>Young people doing delivery jobs or short term contracts, high student debts, etc. get the whip. Socialism and communism are presented as the "good alternative" to this failing (sabotaged) system.</p>
<p>TL:DR: youngster don't read history books.</p>

        <p>&rt; i just don’t understand the desire to not want to work for what you have.</p>
<p>Me neither. The problem however is that a lot of people are basically living to work. They can only pay the essentials in order to work.</p>
<p>When it comes to time, the balance is off. We have free time, but can't enjoy it because we're exhausted.</p>
<p>Now with covid, all perspective on a somewhat normal life is gone.</p>

        <p>I'm going to play devil's advocate here and say that if wages at the bottom weren't such shit, you would have a lot less communist sympathizers among the proletariat demo. But when people are wage slaves, hearing that the upper classes will get their comeuppance via "communism", it starts to sound like a pretty sweet deal.</p>

        <p>if you ask 100 people at random what 'communism' is, you will get 100 different answers</p>
<p>similar to asking what is a 'car'?</p>
<p>as for whether it 'works' or doesn't, that it is a matter of perspective. works for who? it works a treat for the bosses and their minions, not so much for the plebs because being enslaved sucks</p>
<p>also, ACAB. who feels safer when the blue lights are in the rear view mirror? what are cops other than municipal corporate enforcers and mobile revenue generators? they do not stop nor prevent any crimes, they wait for crimes to occur then search for someone to charge and the state pretends to be the victim. the real victim is on their own</p>
