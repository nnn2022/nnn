        <p>covid is a relatively mild virus being confused in the statistical noise of cold and flu, which were already the 2nd most common cause of death in the elderly. If you want to invent a mass panic out of thin air, the best way to do it is to sensationalise respiratory infections.</p>

        <p>No, they probably have about the same lethality, we just have essentially reached herd immunity for COVID by now and most of the current positive tests are flu. Early on it was likely more COVID.</p>

        <p>It easily 100% would. We do &rt;1 million COVID tests per day. We do about 20k flu tests per week. You are definitely going to be tested for COVID first with the more sensitive PCR test. How many people have you heard of testing positive for COVID and then going and getting a flu test to rule that out? The only people getting tested for the flu test negative for COVID first and then go on to get tested for the flu when they have no actual illness because they're fucking hypochondriacs thanks to the COVID propaganda.</p>

        <p>The number of tests for this year is basically the same as the number of tests for last year though: 931k this year vs. 1.1 million last year. That's only an 18.7% decrease. And note that we aren't all the way through the season yet. So this point would be ruled out.</p>
<p>Very rarely do people get tested for influenza, before the pandemic began or even today. Doctors diagnose influenza all the time without doing lab tests for it. That is why there were only 177k positive test specimens last year but an estimated 35.5 million flu cases.</p>
<p>Are there any other counterpoints to the influenza tests being lower than usual? I've already thought of your response before.</p>

        <p>Influenza testing as actually <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm">higher</a> than normal from what I read. 1.3M since September when you total clinical and public lab tests. Average is supposedly around 1M.</p>
<p>I explained why I don't think influenza testing volume really indicates anything; the COVID testing volume is likely to catch all cases and label them COVID. Your point that the number of estimated flu cases is usually far higher than the number of confirmed tests is actually in support of my argument. Most flu diagnoses are made without a test confirmation. Someone has respiratory symptoms, fever, headache? They literally don't even go to a doctor, they go to a COVID testing site. Test is negative? Oh well, must have been something else. They don't hunt down the CDC and tell them they had the flu.</p>
<p>I'm not super invested in this narrative because COVID is estimated at mid/high flu levels of lethality anyway, but the fact that 1) there is no official explanation given, other than masking/distancing which we know is BS; 2) we do an insane amount of testing with a known flawed test; and 3) the authorities admitting that a great many COVID cases are actually flu would <strong>literally</strong> vindicate the "it's just the flu crowd"; makes me think this is a highly probable explanation.</p>

        <p>&rt;They don't hunt down the CDC and tell them they had the flu.</p>
<p>That was why I brought up how there are many more estimated cases than those confirmed in the lab. In the <em>past</em> the CDC didn't hunt down flu cases. So that means the 15.5% is a genuine interpretation of what influenza positivity should be, not because they hunted influenza down to inflate the positivity. If the CDC did hunt for more cases in the past, then wouldn't there be more total testing last year than this year? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;2) we do an insane amount of testing with a known flawed test</p>
<p>I've seen conflicting points of view on the PCR tests. Do you have sources that it is flawed or sources that it is not flawed?</p>

<p>&rt; Coming to Harvard’s own “back yard,” in Massachusetts, 85–90% of those testing positive in July (with a threshold of 40) would have been deemed negative at the 30-cycles threshold. Quoting Dr. Mina directly, "I would say that none of those people should be contact-traced, not one."</p>

        <p>Okay, that's the UK. Also doesn't rule out that it might still cross react with something else at lower thresholds. I'd like to see a study that does full sequencing of full positive samples but haven't found one. The short DNA sequences used in the primers aren't unique to COVID from what I understand, I was reading a study on that but can't find it at present.</p>

        <p>According to CDC themselves 50% of covid deaths had flu as a comorbidity. So it showing up in high numbers. It just isn't being listed as a cause of death and cases are not being reported outside of positive covid tests. It's gonna sound rude but you have to stupid to think the flu just magically disappeared from it's usual what 50million cases per year to zero, rather than this being a bureaucratic bait and switch using very poor testing.</p>

        <p>The issue I have is that there are the same or even more number of influenza lab tests this year than there were last year. So lack of influenza testing because of coronavirus is not the issue here.</p>
<p>Influenza cases are also low in countries like Australia or New Zealand, where coronavirus cases are extremely low. So in these two countries, the coronavirus did not replace influenza.</p>

        <p>Those "3 million deaths" you hear about are not covid deaths. You're mostly seeing old people die from diseases they already had and then being called covid deaths, or just the flu, which has been consistently switched with covid.

        <p>Here is the lab data on the flu from <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/#ClinicalLaboratories">this season</a> and the lab data from the flu from <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6824a3.htm">last season</a>.</p>
<p>This year we had 0.2% test positivity out of 892k tests, while last year we had 15.5% test positivity out of 1.145 million tests. So while the test numbers were fairly equal (tests weren't reduced by very much due to the pandemic), the test positivity is <strong><em>way</em></strong> down by 77.5x.</p>
<p>The exact reasons are unclear. The CDC knows that <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">masks do not prevent the spread of influenza</a>. It is likely because of physical distancing, (most) people staying at home/not socializing, more regular disinfection practices, and significant reductions in global travel.</p>

<p>&rt; Another possible explanation: The coronavirus has essentially muscled  aside flu and other bugs that are more common in the fall and winter.  Scientists don't fully understand the mechanism behind that, but it  would be consistent with patterns seen when certain flu strains  predominate over others, said Dr. Arnold Monto, a flu expert at the  University of Michigan. </p>

        <p>I think the answer is most probably this:</p>
<p>&rt;Another  possible explanation: The coronavirus has essentially muscled  aside  flu and other bugs that are more common in the fall and winter.   Scientists don't fully understand the mechanism behind that, but it   would be consistent with patterns seen when certain flu strains   predominate over others, said Dr. Arnold Monto, a flu expert at the   University of Michigan.</p>

        <p>Agreed and it wouldn’t be the first time.</p>
<p>&rt;    These findings show that one respiratory virus can block infection with another through stimulation of antiviral defences in the airway mucosa, supporting the idea that interference from rhinovirus disrupted the 2009 IAV pandemic in Europe. </p>

        <p>The flu dose suck. Last time I had it was a couple years ago. I was bed bound for a week with stuffed runny sinuses, bad cough, and an aching body.</p>
<p>My employer tried forcing me to get a covid test over my chronic allergy condition and take 72 hours off of work unpaid last year. They told me if I even have a runny nose I wouldnt be able to work. I told them where to go pretty good since my condition effects me all year around almost every day.</p>

        <p>oh no they do, just the flu is much weaker and less contagious than COVID. The reason covid spreads so much more is because of the over abundance of it and the human ignorance to not give a shit and get infected.</p>

        <p>It works by flattening the curve. Measures were never meant to eliminate cases, they were meant to reduce cases. Here's some studies showing the positive effects of lockdown measures:</p>

        <p>Most of your studies were posted in r/science and completely shredded there. The last one was well-recieved, you will have to scroll a bit down to find the problems with it. Also, this paragraph is pretty damning:</p>
<p>&rt;aBecause all states reopened, each state serves as its own control.12 To  estimate what the case rate would have been if the state had not  reopened, we assume the state-specific trend in cases prior to reopening  would have continued to be the same if the state had not reopened. </p>
<p>Here are some good metastudies:</p>

        <p>I'm guessing you found your sources from this comment <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/jystzo/community_use_of_face_masks_and_covid19_evidence/gd843xv?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">here</a>. I appreciate you providing sources against masks that are scientifically based unlike the one from Medical Hypotheses.</p>
<p>There are lots wrong with my sources, thank you for pointing them out. What we really need is better research on masks for coronavirus. I personally feel like it would be a jump to make conclusions about the coronavirus based on studies for influenza, like the ones you posted, but I am not a virologist so I may be in the wrong.</p>

        <p>Yap, that is exactly where I got them from! Picked them up in passing, but I knew one of them beforehand. I appreciate you taking the time to actually go back trough these. We DO need better research to back masks up, while I like to point out how strange it is that in general, studies backing up measures after the fact are extremely scarce. Studies showing how they <em>ought</em> to work are abundant. Maybe it is too hard to measure - but that would mean that the effect is rather small.</p>

        <p>They do work, but there would be a lot more Covid cases if no one wore masks or socially distanced. Those things aren’t 100% effective and no one is claiming they are. They just help reduce the chance of it spreading.</p>

        <p>What! Do you understand the picture? </p>
<p>In the movie the sack of sand and the idol were not the same thing. This caused the boulder to fall. The sack of sand was heavier than the idol. This caused it to push down on the switch. </p>
<p>Apparently you all think the meme is saying the flu and covid are the same thing, but that isn't that its saying.</p>
<p>In this meme, Indiana Jones thinks the flu and covid are the same, but they're not. Covid is heavier than the flu (or whatever) and is about to cause a boulder/pandemic.</p>
<p>This meme actually contradicts the message of this sub.</p>

        <p>Yeah alright bro we understood your episode of explain your meme, BUT it IS just a meme, and I was alluding to reality. I repeat - I dont think  people conflating the two are the ones causing the boulder, in your analogy. Look at the theory I linked, this is our best guess where your precious flu went. I want to repeat also -  I dont belive they are the same.</p>

        <p>&rt;Experts say that measures put in place to fend off the coronavirus — mask wearing, social distancing and virtual schooling — were a big factor in preventing a “twindemic” of flu and COVID-19.</p>
<p>The amount of cherry picking and burying your heads in the sand you nuts do here could be made into a national sport.</p>
<p>Both of your "links" say that covid restrictions (like travel) are the reasons for the drop off of influenza. How are yall this oblivious to the world?</p>
<p>I guess it's easier to pretend there is a worldwide "scamdemic" perpetrated by practically every government in the world than it is to realize you all are just unbelievably selfish and ignorant.</p>
