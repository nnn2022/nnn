    <strong>What if the experiment goes wrong ?</strong>
    <p><p>We are seeing the biggest social/techological/biological experiment in human history right in front of our eyes. A very bold move in a very short period of time. Something never seen before.</p>
<p>The cabal elites planned this whole thing a while ago. You can see TED talks about vaccines solving the "carbon problem". You can see some very known leaders talking about reducing carbon emissions by reducing population,. You can read books talking about a "new world order", that the world needs a "reset", etc . etc.. All these things, that mainstream media likes to call "conspiracy theory",  have always been in plain sight, and since this pandemic started last year, suddenly has accelerated.</p>
<p>Then I was thinking ...</p>
<p>What could go wrong ? What if all of this get out of controll ?</p>
<p>What if these people are so overly self-assured that this could lead for the greatest mistake they ever did ?</p>
<p>What if, trying to controll humanity, they simply cause so much damage that it could be irreversible? They want to merge humans to machine, like that creapy bald guy said. But what if humans can't be merged for some unknown reasons. I wonder if they all tested these things, let's say in concentration camps in China, to see if it works. But what if they are missing some pieces , some data, to calculate their actions?</p>
<p>And, in this process, they started a new bigger problem, even to themselves. So much bigger that even they could'nt predict ?  Humans are  unpredictable creatures sometimes. Nature is unpredictable. They are basicly acting like gods. Changing the course of human history artificially.</p>
<p>We all know what's going on here. But dont you think they are so arrogant of themselves, in their acts, in their motivations, and this could destroy humanity, once and for all?</p>
<p>I know. I'm being totally hiperbolic here. But what if it all goes wrong in the end??</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>PS: English is not my first language. But I hope you got the idea here</p></p>

        <p>They're not symbolic.they were a response to Nephilim.</p>
<p>I seriously recommend looking this up. If you're new to the Bible and cant totally understand that's ok there are many reputable people for example Chuck Missler that break it down in to more understandable terms</p>

        <p>I agree and totally get what you mean. I wrote the following earlier to another redditor, but I'll write out my feelings on this issue again:</p>
<p>I think there is a Dark Evil entity (or entities) that wish to transmogrify humanity into something akin to that of a Borg-like machine. Our human soul is a limitless energy source for these dark entities need to feast from or feed off of us. We are part of what's called the Divine Source or Divine Field. What better way to trap our humanity than enslaving us to a cold-calculating silicon-based contraption. There are conspiracy theories that tell of entrapping a human soul into a silicon-based structure or machine, for the purposes of powering-up the machine or device, to be of service of these Dark Beings. What a horrible fate to those who are entrapped inside of such a contraption, who could not die even if they wished it. I feel strongly that the gothic dark art works that H.R. Giger produced are of the dimension he saw when he had his re-occurring nightmares. He stated in an interview that he would have these utmost horrid, terrifying and vivid nightmares that would haunt him endlessly, which inspired his fascinating art works (which are captured in art book called 'Necronomicon'). </p>
<p>There's already talk of making people take yearly covid vaccines (top-ups or boosters), as this will be made mandatory as part of an agreement whereby people who have agreed to getting the vaccine passport will have to subjugate themselves to yearly shots. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/mt3e6i/the_full_leak_from_the_whistleblower_within_the/"><strong>This post</strong></a> was from an insider in the Canadian Government about how this was going to happen no matter what. There's also a link within the post that leads to a copy of the insider's email. I can't reveal my cards, but I can tell that the email is legitimate and the government of Canada is going forward with "The Great Reset". </p>
<p>Speaking of which, listen very carefully with what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iru9oVn0wI8"><strong>Klaus Schwab says about how the Great Reset Will “Lead to a Fusion of Our Physical, Digital and Biological Identity”</strong></a> in this new 4th Industrial Revolution he's promoting. </p>
<p>Taking that into account, <a href="https://horizons.gc.ca/en/2020/02/11/exploring-biodigital-convergence/"><strong>start reading from the chapter called "Good morning, biodigital"</strong></a>, from a report called "Exploring Biodigital Convergence" produced by Policy Horizons Canada, which is an agency of the Canadian government. I found that chapter extremely alarming to what I see planned for our future. </p>
<p>That document was covered in an interview with James Corbett regarding the <a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/interview-1639-james-corbett-on-the-human-extinction-event/"><strong>Human Extinction Event</strong></a>, and he cites all of his sources below the video. You can also watch it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvHnwo20ehk"><strong>YouTube</strong></a>, but since I hate YouTube for their censorship I'd recommend going to James' website in the previous link provided. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUIcCyPOA30"><strong>this 4min clip titled Deus Ex</strong></a>, while you may find what Alex Jones has to say very confusing and crazy, he knows a lot more than he's letting on. I agreed with exactly everything he says in the 4 minute clip. I have felt this throughout my entire life (I'm "old", but still "young at heart"). </p>
<p>And please watch <a href="https://youtu.be/B2HurtTUtXs?t=362"><strong>this video starting at the 6min mark</strong></a>, and listen very closely to what Alex says about "consciousness". It's more or less the "layman's" version of the "bigger picture" of what's happening. </p>
<p>If you follow the works of independent investigative journalist Whitney Webb or Ryan Christian, the theory goes that the NWO and all these Technocratic billionaires want to hook-up all of humanity up to a super advanced A.I. computer, which will in effect create a human-hybrid mesh-network. They said this may create what is known as the "Singularity" event, whereby mankind might be able to not only predict, but to also alter the future. I think this type of thinking or planning would spell the end of independent thought and destroy free will if we were all hooked-up into a "Collective" hive-mind like system. It would be worse the the Matrix movies. </p>
<p>There's also a Remote Viewer named Mr. Lyn Buchanan (former military man), and he mentioned that by the year 2050 (29 years from now) there were no more large cities, and the human population was very very small in comparison to today's world population. He said that the majority of the populace primarily worked in agriculture (i.e. an Agrarian culture). There was hardly any technology (of today's modern era) that he could see. Earth was still blue and green, so it didn't seem like nuclear fallout or an asteroid nuking us. </p>
<p>My suspicion is that something will happen to the majority of us (maybe due to the technologies behind these evil vaccines), and the survivors decided that everything that happened &amp; plagued mankind was that our spiritual levels were way far below our material wealth (in other words technology was way too far advanced for our species who was starting to decline in our spiritual training and growth). </p>
<p>My feeling is that the way of the Amish or Mennonites or Native American Indians is the true way forward. From there, perhaps after 1000's of years, our psychic latent powers will rise, and then we (as a species) will mature enough to know Good from Evil, when to give rather than take, as well as live in harmony with Mother Earth and Nature as opposed to trying to dominate or control her.</p>

        <p>Arthur C. Clarke wrote a book series called Rama. In it, it was revealed that a race of aliens had wiped themselves out due to a medical mistake where they thought they were curing a disease but it caused a different issue that killed everyone.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that is what will happen, but its a concept that has been thought of.</p>

        <p>Wow!... it sounds like you've really bought into all this. If this was planned all along why were they talking about it on TEDTalks? Makes no sense whatsoever.AndI tell you what else doesn't make sense if this were to be all preconceived is that the amount of people involved in this collusion it's just it's not even vaguely possible.And to think you guys call us doomers!</p>
