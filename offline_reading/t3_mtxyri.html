    <strong>You Can't Expect People To Get Vaccinated If You Demand They Keep Following The Rules</strong>
    <p><p>THE ONLY FUCKING REASON TO TAKE THE DAMN THING IS SO YOU CAN GET BACK TO NORMAL. Isn't that the whole point!? So when you take away that benefit, when you demand those vaccinated continue to wear masks and socially distance, and you move the goalposts for the thousandth fucking time you can't react with Surprised Pikachu faces when there's a pushback and people begin to question why they should even fucking bother getting the Fauci ouchie in the first place!</p>
<p>If you want fucking herd immunity, your best bet is to get all of those vulnerable and old people who are susceptible to the harsher effects of the virus vaccinated and then OPEN EVERYTHING BACK UP. Let the virus burn itself out by infecting those who aren't vulnerable and don't want to take the vaccine; that is how herd immunity is achieved. A combination of vaccination AND infection. You can't expect everyone to get the vaccine: that's impossible without diving into extreme, dystopian measures (not that I'd put it past our governments to go that root or for you doomers to demand it).</p>
<p>You scoff and call us "anti-vaxxers", but if you're the ones screaming and crying online for those vaccinated to carry on wearing masks YOU are the anti-vaxxer. By demanding that those vaccinated carry on living life like they're plague-carrying bilge rats, you are insinuating that the vaccines DO NOT WORK. That the very thing they are designed for is ineffective. Which brings into question: what the fuck is the point of getting it beyond a fruitless symbolic gesture of "wE'rE aLl iN tHiS tOgEthEr!"</p>
<p>You can't call a carrot a stick and then get pissy when people don't want to eat it, you fucking idiots.</p></p>

        <p>Might be cuz people are,  I don't know,  not following any of the guidelines and openly breaking them on the Republican side.   The longer people don't follow protocol the longer the disease will persist.   It's normal when dealing with infectious diseases to see such outcomes when at least a third of the country ignores safety guidelines.   As a diligent veteran I don't really see a problem with a simple cloth mask,  what rights are they violating?  None,  just expecting you to do your duty as an American.   Most civilian forget,  it's not just veterans that have to sacrifice to keep America safe.   God bless America.</p>

        <p>Actually, he thinks his cloth mask is protecting you. That's the point of masks, not to protect ourselves but to protect others. If everyone wears them then you are also protected. That's also the reason to keep wearing the mask while everyone is getting the vaccine. Just because you are vaccinated doesn't mean everyone else is, most younger people only just became eligible. You can still carry the virus and spread it even when you are vaccinated. So just wear the damn mask until most people are vaccinated.</p>
<p>Once we get down to just the anti-vaxxers who will never get vaccinated, then you can feel free to take off the mask because who cares if those people get it and die... That's Darwinism at it's finest.</p>

        <p>You can't infect people if you're vaccinated. That was one of those, "well, we don't know for sure," things that has not materialized, kind of like getting it from surfaces. Remember that?</p>
<p>Also, my cloth mask protected ZERO people over the course of a year. Never had COVID (negative antibody test) and now I'm fully vaccinated, so my mask did exactly what I thought it was doing. Nothing.</p>

        <p>&rt;You can't infect people if you're vaccinated.</p>
<p>That hasn't really been proven because it wasn't part of the trails, and according to an epidemiologist from Rutgers the risk may be "greatly diminished" but it is still possible that a vaccinated person could still shed the virus. We don't have enough evidence to say definitively that vaccinated people can't spread the disease. </p>
<p>Btw, using hindsight to determine that an action you took in the past wasn't necessary is really dumb. That's like saying, "I never got a cavity so I shouldn't have wasted time brushing my teeth every day." Especially if you and everyone you were around actually did wear the mask when in busy public areas since that would contribute to why you didn't get the virus.</p>

        <p>While your hindsight comment is true, I certainly can say that I didn't think it mattered, and I was right. You can say I was just luckily right, but I was still right. People give me a hard time for carrying a gun, saying I'll never need it, and if I never do they will have been right.</p>

        <p>But see, you seem to be coming to two mutually exclusive conclusions based on the same logic. You carry a gun (I have no issue with that as long as you are responsible and well trained) in case you may need it someday. It's risk mitigation, the same as wearing a mask. You don't look back at every time you wore your gun and think, well I should never have worn it because nothing ever happened. You say, luckily nothing ever happened, but I was protected if it did. </p>
<p>However, you seem to be saying you think the opposite for the mask wearing, that because you never needed it, it was dumb to wear it. The conclusions reached are on opposite ends of the spectrum and seem to be based on how you initially felt about the action on the first place.</p>

        <p>Well, exactly. I'm doing my own risk management to decide how I act. I'm not trying to make everyone carry guns so that they can fight all the criminals. I'm doing it for myself. Neither am I trying to tell people that THEY shouldn't wear masks if that's what they want to do.</p>

        <p>That mask isn't protecting me if he isn't sick, nor is it protecting anyone else. Its just security theater. So again, how are healthy people wearing masks protecting anyone?  </p>

<p>If you really are a veteran, you took and oath to protect the constitution from enemies foreign and domestic; freedom of assembly is being infringed. At the very least you can not openly support tyranny. </p>
<p>You're trying to protect people from themselves and violating their basic right and responsibility to manage their own health. </p>
<p>You also made a choice to temporarily waive your rights while serving, civilians don't do that, they should not be held to the same standard as an active duty service member. </p>

        <p>Pretty sure I know what freedom means more than most.  Im third generation,  wasd in the air force along with an uncle.   Had an uncle and grand father in the army and an uncle in the marines.   2 of those men died due to complications from agent orange.  Another of those men is broken completely.   I can tell you this,  if 3 generations of my family can serve freedom and sacrifice for it by following government mandates I think you can get a prick in the a arm and wear a mask.   Love,  3 generations of American heroes.</p>

        <p>Funny coming from the group who votes for these things without question,  am I right?  I don't watch tv homie.   Rots the mind,  I read...a lot of reading whenever I have some time,  it's my duty as an American to be properly informed is it not?  As for a glorified mercenary,  I was assigned to a gulf search and rescue base as a jet mechanic.   Saved more lives than I helped end.   And damn proud of it.   I wonder why the average American thinks they don't need to sacrifice for America,  that's what gets me.  We all have to even civilians.  For or country to be great were must act as one United front.   seems the height of hubris to expect things without personal sacrifice ya feel me?  As for conglomerates well,  I'll point you to mitch McConnell.   Never have I seen such a boot licker, which party does he represent?</p>

        <p>Weill,  cuz generally speaking,  the GOP's platform its nonexistent.   They haven't made any policy change that benefits the middle class for 70 years.   In place of both I only see thinly veiled racism and just general corruption.   If Democrats were half as dirty I'd be up their assess like an enema.  Like with Biden completely wasting American tax payers dollars on that bull shit lip service gun control.   None of that has any actual affect on gun control.   Time better spent developing mental health and background checks for instance.   Nor do I approve of how slowly he's cleaning up the border,  sheer bull imo.  Then again trump started the border crisis so it's a couple years back flow but jesus get them out the tents.</p>

        <p>Don't forget it was Republican who fabricated the Afghan and Iraqi lies.   They did that.   Yes Obama built the camps but I doubt they were meant for long term inhabitants,  it was trump who exacerbated and prolonged that situation sir.   I didn't choose to oppresse anyone,  I chose to serve my country,  citizen.   I followed the orders of then Republican president George Bush jr. Backed by Congress to achieve the mission.   I made sure people flew safe,  and did a good job.   I have yet to ask and im sorry for being insensitive,  but how do you think you stand politically?  As an important follow up do you follow qanon?  You don't seem qanon to me which is great,  you are still rational.</p>

        <p>A veteran's remembrance of duties has absolutely, positively, NOTHING to do with this conversation. Shame on you for attempting to comingle the two. You make it sound quite cutesy and simple, this gross violation of personal freedoms, with little to zero scientific evidence of the efficacy of these practices. Surely you realize that naturally acquired immunity is grossly superior to whatever the F is in those pricks in the arm? Surely you realize that we all have the freedom to evaluate the situation from all angles and make our own decisions, which we are inherently free to do, at all times, including now? You are welcome to wear a mask and take 1000 shots per year if you like. You are NOT welcome to suggest that others blindly follow the bad advise you dispense like gumballs from a vending machine.</p>

        <p>One veteran to another, get off your high horse. The fact you are a veteran does not make your opinion on this matter any more credible. The science does not support lockdowns, mask mandates, remote schooling, restrictions on the freedom to assemble in general, etc. The constant moving of the goal posts is a threat to our Republic and if you were honest and true to your oath, you would open your eyes and see it for yourself.</p>

What pissed me off about that new South Park special was they had all the old people celebrating and going back to normal after getting their jabs which clearly ISN'T the case. Nope, gotta carry on wearing masks, social distancing, eating/drinking outdoors when you go to a restaurant or a pub, etc.</p>

        <p>Real life isn't South Park. Until  herd immunity is reached and enough are vaccinated youll have to wear a mask. I know it's hard for you to understand simple things. And that you have trouble understabding that facts aren't just things you agree with. If you cared enough you could literally google why masks are still necessary for now.

        <p>If that's how your do your research you're a bigger dumbass than I thought. You cant punch a biased search term into a search engine and expect an unbiased result.  That's not even touching on how the whole first page of results are from known misinformation websites that have a track record of posting false information that is easily disproved and has been.</p>
<p>The correct search term would be
https://duckduckgo.com/?q=studys+showing+mask+efficacy&amp;ia=web</p>
<p>This find study's simply testing efficacy which can result in good efficacy or bad efficacy or somewhere in between.</p>
<p>You're a great example of why the majority of this sub are complete idiots who spread misinformation. What you're doing isn't research, it's bias confirmation.</p>
<p>But I don't expect you to learn anything even if you do make it through what I wrote. You'll probably counter with how all those websites are reputable because they have to be, after all to admit you've been duped by your piss poor research skills would be admitting you are wrong and not very bright.  But it's actually the opposite. Intelligent people admit they are wrong and are willing to learn how to better themselves. But from your post history, you clearly want nothing to do with that.</p>

        <p>Flu is extremely prone to mutation, covid has self-correcting processes and actually is pretty stable.  They talk up any change to drive ratings and drama on the news.</p>
<p>The flus you gets shots against are essentially different sub-species, but if you have had a shot against a related one, it actually does tend to convey some protection against the newer one.  There are generally hundreds or thousands of recognized families of flu virus though.</p>
<p>On the other hand, measles can't change at all really and survive in what we target, so one vaccine is all that's needed.</p>
<p>Covid is more likely to be closer to the measles side of things, or in the middle, but not flu.</p>
<p>Even if covid doesn't change enough to warrant another booster, Pfizer already sold its investors on this being their long term cash cow, so they will want you to take it for their bottom line.</p>

        <p>the vaccine is only really effective if everyone gets it. for instance some people may not be able to get it due to compromised immune systems. To not get sick everyone around them should be vaccinated so they can't get sick. it's called herd immunity. also you can still transmit Coro a if you don't have it. say if someone who had Corona  coughed on your hand and you shook someone else's before washing your hands (without touching eyes nose etc) you probably didn't get corona while that person could now get it. it is similar if it enters your body through you nose/mouth. you could sneeze it or cough it up without your body killing it yet of you inhaled the virus. the coughing/sneezing could potentially infect someone else. many ways for some who is immune to infect others.</p>

        <p>That's one of the problems. There are millions of people who swear on their lives they won't get it - so if the vaccine requires everyone to be vaccinated to work, then the vaccine, well... isn't going to work. That's just how it is.</p>
<p>Instead, as OP mentioned, a more realistic idea is to perhaps vaccinate all the sensitive individuals to prevent them from dying or becoming hospitalized - and then let everyone go back to normal. Those who choose not to be vaccinated are voluntarily accepting the risks of catching COVID, and that's that.</p>
<p>The only problem is that this doesn't account for those who physically are unable to be vaccinated due to something like an autoimmune disorder. But theoretically, if social distancing and masks work so well, it shouldn't be a problem to tell <em>those who are unable to be vaccinated</em> to stay home, order groceries to be delivered (with the option to ask the delivery person to wear a mask upon arrival and leave it at the door), only go outdoors if it's in an open area away from people, etc - and while those people are chilling at home, the rest of everyone else (who aren't at risk for hospitalization or death) can go about their lives. Heck, we could even accommodate further - have recommended protocol for how someone should interact with a person who has an autoimmune disorder. Have protocol for how groceries are sanitized before delivery or something. There are plenty of options if you wanna go over the top, for keeping those people safe without locking everything down and enforcing masks and mass vaccinations.</p>
<p>(Also, correct me if I'm wrong, but herd immunity is used not to reference everyone getting vaccinated - but to reference everyone coming in contact with the virus, and getting through it, developing antibodies, and slowly but surely through everyone's immunity rising, the virus eventually has no power and it goes away or at least weakens. You can say vaccines can help with this - but these vaccines are very different from normal vaccines. Although that's a different conversation entirely, so I won't get into that one.)</p>

        <p>I believe this is all part of the plan. Voice out absurd ideas that most people will agree with (vaccine passports), in order to make getting the vaccine seem like a much more reasonable idea in comparison. It's a bait and switch, and it's a common pattern they've been using lately. I'm just ashamed it took me until recently to notice it. </p>
<p>Remember that 2030 "You'll own nothing and you'll be happy" article? Yeah, that was to gauge public reaction to such an idea. They haven't discarded the idea, but they'll slowly implement it in comfortable and convenient ways over the next 10 years, then when the idea seems more realistic, they'll push it again. If that kind of society comes into fruition, might as well save up your wealth and be one of the guys renting properties to others and profiting off of society's new structure.</p>

        <p>We should have done this from the start.  Protect and isolate the weak and vulnerable and then let the virus run its course.  Instead we told old people they'd be safe shopping in supermarkets when everyone is constantly adjusting their damp masks before handling the card reader.  We told people it's safe to eat at a restaurant when the guy preparing your food is touching his mask the whole time.  500k are dead.</p>

        <p>It's not about limiting deaths; never was.</p>
<p>Actually, if you look at the establishment's behavior, they seem to have done everything possible to <em>maximize</em> the number of deaths:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not preventing international travel</li>
<li>Allowed virus to spread unhindered for several months</li>
<li>Suppressed information about legal, effective treatment</li>
<li>Prevented herd immunity through lockdowns</li>
<li>Putting people on ventilators</li>
</ul>
<p>Etc.</p>
<p>As soon as they started using the phrase, "the new normal," I knew instantly what was up: covid is their excuse to do location tracking in the West.</p>
<p>Whoever's in charge decided that personal freedom is over. They don't have enough security forces to oppress everybody; they need us to comply or it doesn't work. So, create a pandemic and try to run up the death count, and cover it 24/7.</p>
<p>The blackpill is that it mostly worked.</p>

<p>Are they gonna keep complying with ever more ridiculous mandates and edicts or slowly begin to see this for the farce that it is and admit they were duped.</p>

        <p>The argument is: "We have to protect the people who can't get the vaccine".</p>
<p>But since it's supposedly safe for even <em>old people</em> and <em>pregnant women...</em> aren't we down to like... 0.01% of the population that are physically unable to be vaccinated? ... Is my math wrong?</p>
<p>I'm not saying that small percentage doesn't matter - everyone matters - but there should be special instructions for those who are susceptible and can't be vaccinated (recommend they stay indoors or something), and then let the rest of us go back to normal. I don't really understand why that seems unfathomable.</p>

        <p>The vaccines (Pfizer at least, idk about the others) is working it's way through FDA approval, but approval takes time. Once fully approved, I imagine those vaccinated will be permitted to return to "normal". An emergency situation like COVID-19 definitely warrants the emergency use of a potentially functioning vaccine. I really don't understand what's so difficult about that. I have never seen a subreddit with a lower collective IQ or level of care for the general public health than this one. Enjoy your little echo chamber you hopeless cave-dwellers.</p>

        <p>It's not a matter of being afraid to live life you simpleton. It's a matter of caring for others. The only realistic way we end the torture that is lockdowns and restrictions, is to eradicate the virus. The only way that's possible is to work together and that means everybody has to do their part and mask up. That also includes limiting the unnecessary trips for vacations or restaurants. Again, really simple things that people like you are refusing to do because "YoUrE iNfRiNgInG oN mY rIgHtS"</p>

        <p>You assert that the virus can/will be eradicated and yet you call him the simpleton?  There's a reason only one or two viruses have ever been offically eradicated (smallpox and one other livestock disease): They have millions of years of evolution behind them and they're <em>really really</em> good at what they do.  Covid isn't going anywhere, big guy, no matter what people do or what vaccines are out there.</p>

        <p>You can’t “eradicate” this virus. Experts have been saying it will be endemic for nearly half a year. </p>
<p>Also, I care for others as do most people in this subreddit. It is stated multiple times a day in this subreddit that the correct approach to this should have been isolate the at risk population while allowing healthy people to get back to their daily tasks. </p>

        <p>It's adorable that you think I care that much about how you live your day-to-day life. I only care when you're actions are directly impacting my day-to-day life. Suck it up, wear a mask, wash your hands, and social distance/isolate, and watch how life starts to return to normal. I don't like the lockdowns any more than the rest of you, I'm just ready to work on ending it. Unfortunately, that requires the help of you crybabies</p>

        <p>Of course, how did I not predict the classic "you've been convinced" comeback. Bro... What?? The very fact that the virus is still infecting more and more people everyday, forcing the requirement of masks and other regulations, is proof enough that the actions of people like you are impacting my day-to-day. Are you seriously living under a rock or something? Secondly, why do you just assume that this past year has been something that I like? "Next time something they don't like is forced upon them"?? Bro it's happening right now. I don't want to have to wear a mask for 9 hours a day. I don't want to have my vacation plans postponed indefinitely. "They" are tired of this too. "They" are just the only ones working towards a resolution which can never be achieved without the cooperation of the "COVID deniers". This is NOT hard to comprehend, I promise you.</p>

        <p>And how did I not predict being called a "COVID denier?"  The SARS-CoV-2 virus exists, and causes COVID-19. Lots of other things kill people every year too, and I don't deny them either. I fully comprehend it, I promise you.</p>
<p>&rt; a resolution which can never be achieved without the cooperation of the "COVID deniers"</p>
<p>You sure about that?  Because by sometime later this year, it's going to fade away (by "it" I mean widespread sickness. Surely, governments can keep the "cases" going by testing everyone and their dog.) How will that have been acheived with those evil devils going to baseball games and stuff? Curious.</p>

<p>You're a cuck as far as most of us think, what did you expect? Haha. I can tell you're naive af too.</p>
<p>C'mon prove your point. But before you do, did you know that every year 2 million people die because of snails? Where is the lockdown until snails are brought under control? </p>
<p>You have more chance of dying in a car accident or being hit by lightning if you are young enough, why don't we just lockdown inside forever, the world is such a scary place after all!!</p>

<p>I remember when I was 33, it wasn't until I was 39 I figured out a whole lot more about myself. You'll get there young pup. Had a few years of enlightenment since then too! Snivelling brat, hahahahaha.</p>

        <p>Apparently you didn't figure out that you shouldn't put others in danger. And didn't learn how to be a decent human.</p>
<p>Why the fuck am I here? Is 33 too young for reddit? Or too old? If it's too old, what the fuck are <em>you</em> doing here? If it's too young then I guess I didn't realize this was a 39+ platform..</p>
<p>I don't believe you about your age, but if you're really 39, it's very sad that you are so lost.. you're getting kind of old for being a self important brat, don't you think?</p>

        <p>You took what I said completely wrong lmfao, but why am I not surprised. Also you can't figure out how old I am but tried and got it wrong, blaringly... You're a narcissistic idiot. Quite a dangerous combination. </p>
<p>If you can't take what I said and dissect it correctly there is reason to continue this beyond brain numbing exchange. You're beneath me at this point. We cannot communicate, you don't understand written word. Lmfao.</p>
