        <p>I already had covid so I find them especially useless. Not only did I catch covid from a customer at work while we both were wearing a mask, I also am now immune to it for a decent amount of time.</p>

        <p>They don't work, because you'll only get covid if you take the vax.  No unvaccinated person has ever had the covid virus found/isolated in them. Ever. </p>
<p>Masks do significantly increase bacterial infections and acne.  So if you want some super zits with your pneumonia go for it.</p>

<p>I'm going to have to disagree with this statement, although I totally agree that Covid isn't the big issue the media has made it. 
Perhaps you could expound on that statement though?</p>

        <p>I don't have the link on my phone, but it's been posted here many times.  There have been multiple foia requests to multiple states and countries.   Every single one has come back that they have no information on any instance where covid 19 was actually found/isolated in any unvaccinated person.  You think if they had the info... they'd be throwing it our faces.  They have zip.</p>

        <p>My dad had Covid before the vaccine came out.  He even had to be hospitalized for it. </p>
<p>Unless you mean no completely unvaccinated person has ever had Covid. Because he had gotten the normal vaccines that most people receive throughout life</p>

<p>Just focus on the logical and reasonable stuff that we can all agree on. This "deadly" virus is overhyped, the media is clearly controlling the entire narrative, and government overreach has reached its limit in free countries.</p>

        <p>All I can say is no one has ever been reported, with actual proof, if having covid if they had not received the covid vaccine.  The PCR test is completely useless. They tested a rock, a goat and a fruit and they all were positive.  Even the inventor, Kary Mullis, has stated it is completely useless for testing for an infection.  It only looks for building blocks.  Flu and pneumonia went to essentially 0 during the plandemic because hospitals were being paid upwards of 30k for any reported covid diagnoses.  Therefore everyone had covid.  Got hit by a bus... covid.  Drowned... covid.  Stroke... covid.  Had a local guy here that got a blood clot from a leg injury hit his lung.. yep, died of covid.</p>

        <p>Well, I definitely understand where you are coming from there. I just know that he was extremely ill, tested positive for Covid, was in the ICU for a week and went home on oxygen. 
He is diabetic and in his early 70s and he has fully recovered. It was definitely not the "death sentence" that everyone in the media said it was.</p>

        <p>Honestly he probably had a horrible flu or pneumonia. I'm very glad he's ok, those can be very serious on their own. A lot of hospitals were directed to send patients home until they required a ventilatator, I think maybe to drive up numbers.. glad he got the care needed. </p>
<p>Type 2 diabetes is reversible, you might check out keto + intermittent fasting.  I reversed my pre type 2, and have had several friends and family members completed reverse their full on type 2... including one who had been taking insulin and metformin for almost over a decade.  It also fixed all of our high blood pressure issues..  Not a doctor, just letting you know what worked for us.  Hope it helps your family!</p>

        <p>Very glad to hear it.   Might do some research, I remember reading a year or so ago that type 1 can also be reversed if the body fat % can be driven low enough.  This apparently forces the brain to send the pancreas instructions to regrow the beta cells that make insulin.  If I can find the article with th study again I will share.</p>

        <p>The youth are so grateful for the  selfless generosity of boomers which have passed along a world of bright hopeful possibilities that they are willing to sacrifice living their own lives so that their elders can prolong theirs without having to make any healthy lifestyle adjustments that they may find discomforting.</p>

        <p>Why Pro-covexers are hypocrites?  </p>
<p>They ignore / dismiss / have no empathy for / don’t care about</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>natural immunity (u might already have antibodies for c19 and thus render covexs irrelevant)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VAERS DATA (covex deaths, disabilities and injuries)(covexs cause more harm than good)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most common covex side effects: blood clotting, cerebral haemorrhage, heart inflammation and death.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>C19 virus has survival rate of 99.95% and above for most (It’s a non threat and age 70 and below are not at risk)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nuremburg code (informed consent, choice, lives and health)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Covexs aren’t fully FDA approved for safety use (need Decades of data and clinical trials)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No long term data to back up the claim of “safe and effective”. (did they build a time machine?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mRNA covexs are experimental and alters human dna (keep mutating and shedding virus spike proteins)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>covexed can spread their own variants and cause even more serious consequences than c19.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one is liable for any damage or death caused by covexs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one is willing to sign liability agreements for pushing covexs and be responsible for deaths, disabilities and injuries. (They know they are doing harm!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are taught to say no to drugs but now taught to rely on drugs to protect us!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They want to covex the youth (18 and below) and babies (who have almost 100% survival rate)(covexs could cause fertility issues in the future.)</p>
