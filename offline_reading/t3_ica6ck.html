        <p>This man has got balls but he’s telling the truth. </p>
<p>People are only peaceful for so long. They strip a mans ability to feed his family, to live his life, demand all these things of him, and try to demoralize him and shame him. don’t be surprised when shit hits the fan.</p>

        <p>He's a vet. I'm a vet. We were losing 22 guys a day to suicide BEFORE March and these insane lockdowns now veterans everywhere are killing themselves or drinking themselves to death. I've also known multiple guys to commit suicide during this period. All these guys have is what little middle class job they have and usually maybe one or two hobbies all of which have been taken away from them. More veterans have committed suicide during this period than have died of Covid like 100x over. This entire thing is beyond maddening.</p>

        <p>He's completely right that shit will hit the fan if people start to go hungry.  But I fear that the people in power realize this.  This pandemic has proven that as long as people have food on the table and Netflix on the TV, they'll put up with a terrifying amount of totalitarianism.</p>
<p>We're either gonna see the government keep seizing power and get away with it, or we're going to see shit pop off and things get really bad, and quite frankly I don't know what scenario scares me more.</p>

        <p>A brilliant speech, by a man who is hurting. You can hear the pain in his voice. He is a hero. I want to fight alongside this revolutionary. This video needs to be spread far and wide. And I wish I could get in contact with him.</p>

        <p>I wasn't gonna speak; I was asked to speak here. Y'know? Sheriff, good to see you. </p>
<p>I'm telling you guys: I'm pretty appalled at what's going on. Y'know, at first we said, as concerned citizens, that we all want to figure out how to best navigate our way through this whole COVID thing, y'know, and as we realized that it's not quite as dangerous as we thought it would be, I was absolutely appalled by the cowardice; and as you're sitting there with your masks on, I don't blame you for wearing masks, because I'd be hiding my face too, if I was you, for what you're doing. It's absolutely horrendous what you're doing to these people. </p>
<p>I'm a business owner, and I'm telling you: our families are starving. You guys can sit here with your jobs, you guys can sit here and you're going to get paid, fall asleep in your chair like that gentleman's doing behind his mask right there, and I'm telling you right now, that right now, we're being peaceful. And you better be happy that we're good citizens, that we're peaceful citizens, but it's not going to be peaceful much longer. </p>
<p>And this isn't a threat. I'm not a criminal. I've never been a criminal. But I'm telling you: Good citizens are going to turn into real concerned and revolutionary citizens real soon. And nobody else is going to say that. I am probably the only person that has the balls to say what I am saying right now. We're building. We're organizing. And we'll work with law enforcement or without law enforcement, but you won't stop us when the time comes, because our families are starving. </p>
<p>And if you don't hear the seriousness in my voice, I hope you open your ears and you absolutely listen to what I'm saying, because this is a warning for what's coming. It's not going to be peaceful for much longer. It's not going to be "rah rah," it's not going to be speeches, it's not going to be gathering outside saying the Pledge of Allegiance, it's not going to be waving flags. It's going to be real. When you see the see things that I've seen... </p>
<p>I went to war for this country. I've seen the ugliest, dirtiest part of humanity. I've been in combat, and I never want to go back again. But I'm telling you what: I will, to save this country. If it has to be against our own citizens, it will happen. And there's a million people like me. And you won't stop us.</p>
<p>Open the county! Let our citizens do what they need to do!
Let owners of businesses do what they need to do to feed their families! Take the masks off! Quit masking and muzzling your children! The psychological damage you're doing to them is horrible! </p>
<p>I've had six friends kill themselves since this happened; veterans who lost their jobs. How do you feel about being complicit in perpetuating that? The greatest hoax ever perpetuated on the American people? And you're a part of it by wearing your masks.</p>
<p>In Shasta County, we're supposed to be red country up here. Not blue country. We're red country up here. You guys know that. You claim to be conservatives, maybe you're not; maybe you're liberals, I don't know. </p>
<p>But, by God, we're Americans. Remember that. Take your masks off. Quit muzzling yourselves. Join us! Fight with us! Against what's going on in Sacramento. It's a travesty. </p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

        <p>Let me just say, as someone who taught university-level rhetoric/writing for most of my adult life, that this speech hits an incredible number of rhetorical devices that make up all "good" speeches. I could catalog them, but you already have an innate sense of what good rhetoric devices do to the listener. (You're amped up, right? Right.) I dunno if this dude did this off the cuff, but if he did, he's a goddamned genius. </p>
<p>Let's just say for the sake of argument that this goes viral and leads to something; this could be one of the better speeches in all of American history. I actually mean that. Objectively great. <em>Objectively.</em></p>

        <p>That speech had more heart than anything I’ve heard out of this whole fucked up situation. </p>
<p>What I’ve realized the whole of our problem is in the US is that we’re too spread out and facing drastically different circumstances. There needs to be one of this guy in every state to rally behind.</p>
<p>We may not have the means to march on Washington because too many of us are “eSSenTiAL” but we sure as fuck can March to our own governors houses demanding what this country was founded upon.</p>
<p>Freedom.</p>
<p>Fuck it, I spend half my day on my phone anyway. Guide me to where the best place to organize a march on Whitmers house is and I’ll put it together.</p>

        <p>I am really interested in the literary devices that you mention - I'd love to hear more on this if you have time to elaborate. I spotted rhetorical questions, a lot of repetition, change of pace (shorter/longer sentences), and emotive language.</p>

        <p>This was taken in Shasta. When I was up in those parts looking for land back two years ago, I stopped fairly often to talk to farmers and ranchers and stuff. The hatred for Sacramento is palpable and comes out with very little enticing. I don't mean everyday run-of-the-mill distrust of government, either. I mean 1776 levels of Fuck You.</p>

        <p>People don't want to think about it, but this guy is right. People don't stay peaceful forever, especially when the government is doing nothing to keep people whole during all these restrictions. They continue to keep everything shut down AND Congress never reached a deal for more aid. People are going to get desperate and white women in the suburbs sharing #stayhome #wearamask on social media isn't going to stop them.</p>

        <p>I really like that he kept accusing people of hiding behind masks.  He's not wrong.  Masks are supposed to be a medical thing.  But recently they've just become a way to signal compliance and separate the "in" group from the "out" group.</p>

        <p>My jaw dropped at "I've had 6 friends kill themselves."  Most people know zero people that have died from COVID or suicide.  I can't even imagine how the veteran community is handling this shit.  And he's right about masks too, whether or not it's "just a mask", there's a psychological aspect to it that people refuse to acknowledge.  Aside from the psychological effects on kids, let's stop pretending there aren't any effects on adults.</p>
<p>Ever wonder why it's so easy to be an outspoken asshole on the internet compared to real life?  Anonymity is why.  Just one more human aspect to remove from a discussion so it's no longer one person talking to another.  It's just one opinion trying to be louder than the other.</p>

        <p>That hit hard when he mentioned the 6 friends that killed themselves. I knew the statistics were skyrocketing already but haven't heard anyone with direct experience speak out before. Powerful speech. The world needs more people like this that are willing to put the foot down, take a stand, stand up for what's right. Otherwise there won't be anything left to save.</p>
<p>I assumed it's ok (just let me know if it's not), I made backups of the video <a href="https://lbry.tv/@LockdownSkepticism:f/video_2020-08-18_21-05-43:7">here</a> and <a href="https://www.bitchute.com/video/PQIXB1CxoLhp/">here</a></p>
<p>Fuck the lies, fuck the manipulation, fuck the censorship and fuck anyone that continues to knowingly and deliberately perpetuate what ultimately amounts to crimes against humanity. You're not fucking "saving" anyone with your blind obedience.</p>

        <p>Beautiful. And absolutely 100% correct.</p>
<p>This <em>is</em> going to be what comes. I've said this elsewhere on here and in person. A vaccine isn't going to end this. Idiotic self perpetuating fear rules too many people's lives now. And governors and local officials aren't ever going to give up the unlimited dictator powers they've granted themselves. The only way this end at this point will be through an actual fight. And honest to god I think most police forces and military will be on the side of ending this, on our side.</p>
<p>When the time comes I will fight.</p>
