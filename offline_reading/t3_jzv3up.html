    <strong>Thank you all. I love this subreddit!</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve been skeptical of all of the COVID-19 stuff from the very start. It seemed drastic and unwarranted when the US/Canadian border closed one week after I returned from my weekend vacation in New Brunswick March 13-15...</p>
<p>As a US citizen, I felt safe from all of the craziness of this virus crap for a good period of time. March, and into April, I felt untouchable. Living in the northeast United States, in the very sparsely populated state of Maine, it was almost like corona was something only city people had to deal with and worry about. </p>
<p>Fast forward into the summertime, the lockdowns and governor’s mandates had become increasingly more trivial and convoluted. Things like how you couldn’t attend any group activities in-person, but you could go and eat in a restaurant full of mofos on a busy Friday evening (as long as you wear your mask on the walk between the door and the table of course)</p>
<p>All of it just irked me to the core of my soul. And then I ended up getting sick the first week of November. Started out with body aches at work on a Monday while performing normal heavy lifting that i do everyday. Ended up with a 101.4 fever by the end of the day along with body chills and a headache. I didn’t feel like i was going to die, bud I knew that I was going to call out of work the next day! I figured I’d get a covid test because it’s the hip new thing to pitch a fit about and why not right. Might as well see what all the hype is about. I did it for the sake of my workplace too (I work with a few older guys in their 60’s with pre-existing conditions, one guy who’s going for surgery soon too). Anyways, fast forward a few days, and by Thursday (3 days after symptom onset) morning I feel good as new. Even better than I did before to be honest. I went and called my boss and asked him what the deal was... I said I felt fine and that I was waiting on my test results to come in (they take a long time to get test results here in Maine right now) on the following Monday (which was 7 days after symptom onset). He told me “yeah if you feel fine and haven’t had a fever for 24 hours come back to work, we need your help and we miss you!”</p>
<p>So I went back to work on Monday (7 days after onset of symptoms). I was at work, doing normal functions and I get a phone call from the damn CDC and they tell me that I tested positive for coronavirus. We were in the middle of operating heavy and loud machinery so I told them “I’m at work right now, can I call you back later?...” you can only imagine the response of the lady on the phone calling from the CDC hahahaha. </p>
<p>So anyways, long story short. I ended up having to stay home from work for the following week (until 10 days after my onset of symptoms) which was boring as hell. But it was decent because my company still paid me due to some relief funding they were able to obtain from the CARES act. 2 out of the 3 other people that I live with in my household ended up getting sick and testing positive as well. Both of them did great and have made a full recovery as well. </p>
<p>But after having gone through all of this bullshit and actually having been ILL with and DIAGNOSED with covid, it’s really not that big of a deal. Like it wasn’t even the sickest I’ve ever been. I’ve had influenza bugs that were worse than covid was. And the funny thing is, when people find out through the grapevine that my family and I had covid, they’re always shocked; as in they’re surprised that we didn’t just fucking keel over and die. lol. Seriously it wasn’t that bad at all. It was more of an inconvenience than anything. And after my results came in, all the people that I directly work with in mg company ended up testing negative too, despite me breathing normally around them WITHOUT a mask on, EVERYDAY at work. </p>
<p>This whole thing is horseshit and I’m tired of it. I’m no longer wearing a mask when I go shopping. It’s all just a mind game. 100% convinced and convinced after having my own experience with it.</p>
<p>Hope you all are doing well. Stay healthy and stay keen.</p></p>

        <p>The problem is that a positive PCR test doesn't <strong>necessarily</strong> mean you or anyone actually have COVID, and that's why this is all so insane. You could very well have been "asymptomatic" for COVID (like so many healthy people) and had a regular flu instead. Notice how nobody is making that distinction, EVER? How many people are deathly ill but then find out "huh, weird, it's NOT COVID"?</p>
<p>The PCR test was never designed to indicate that a person's body was overloaded (ie, <strong>truly infected</strong>) with some given virus, it only tests for the BAREST PRESENCE of genetic material. That's it. That's why fruits/goats/cats/etc can all test positive for it.</p>
<p>If the inventor were still alive today (conveniently died in 2019) he'd be telling everyone that would listen what bullshit these tests are, just as he did back then (re: HIV/AIDS). Incidentally he hated Fauci with a passion, so there's that.</p>
<p>Just stop and ask yourself: what happened to the flu? What happened to all the other causes of death? Is it <strong>possible</strong> that this test, which flags plenty of healthy people as "asymptomatic carriers", isn't to be trusted in testing for cause of death? If you multiply the number of people who die every year in country X by the false positive rate, how many is that? etc.</p>
<p>Journalists (and lots of medical professionals) don't ask these questions, because <strong>they don't want to know, and they're getting paid to remain terribly uncurious</strong>.</p>

        <p>Wow so crazy, you didn't drop dead and die from the worst pandemic in 100 years!!?!? /S. I was just at an illegal gathering this weekend (actually 2 one on sat/sun). I got talking to a friend and we both were just so glad to be socializing and back to normal. Soo Thank You! There are a lot of us ready to live our lives again. The lame stream media want to keep our voices silenced and divided. It's not working.</p>

<p>You know we're in the 20's again. Should speakeasy's come back into fashion with just groups of people instead of alcohol?</p>

        <p>r/NoNewNormal is one of the few subreddits that don't make me feel anxious when trying to discuss what is going on in the world right now. It's one of the few places on this site where I do feel free to express me opinion.</p>
<p>There's so much censorship on most other subreddits out there it's hard to believe that Reddit was once a freehaven for shitposters and mentioned in the same breath as 4chan.</p>

        <p>My dad got it and was basically tired for a few days, off and on. He says now that he is feeling some residual effects that are improving slowly. He also has a way of playing things up to be more serious than they actually are.</p>
