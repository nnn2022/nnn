    <strong>Experienced the 'dehumanizing' of masks today... felt really weird.</strong>
    <p><p>We've had the mask thing in effect for a few months here, and I've been working at home since March. Since starting WFH, I started going to a local coffee shop every morning (once they were allowed back open) around 6:30. I've ended up making pretty good friends with the barista there, sometimes chatting for up to 30 minutes. </p>
<p>I also haven't had a haircut since March and let's just say the jewfro was in full force. I got it cut 2 days ago. Usually when I walk into the coffee shop, the barista and I will just start shooting the shit even if there are other customers there. This morning? After my haircut, he didn't even recognize me with the mask on. Nothing at all. Felt REALLY fucking weird. I did not like how that made me feel, threw me off big time. Fuck this shit.</p></p>

        <p>People will try to tell you this is no big deal in the grand scheme of this but they are 100% wrong.</p>
<p>Humans thrive on these kind of interactions. They keep us awake and alive (just how they don't want us to be). You have every right to feel upset about this and I have exactly the same experiences daily. I never wear a mask but it doesn't matter I can't hear what people are saying behind their perspex and cloth there is no incentive for friendly interaction I have no idea what expression they are making it's incredibly dehumanising and none of this is an accident.</p>
<p>I must say though that you just shouldn't wear a mask. I really hate to hear about people giving in. Just don't wear one ever. I don't. It might make life a bit harder for you but this is a fight we all have to take on right now.</p>

        <p>The maskers say “it’s just an inconvenience”.  Well ya NOT wearing one is the inconvenience we have to do.  Might have to find different places to shop but the more you go out without a mask, the easier it is.</p>

        <p>Would wearing a mask make my life easier? Yes. I'm probably going to lose my job when more people start coming in. I had plane staff call the police on me and held everyone up on the runway but police never came so eventually they just let me go. </p>
<p>By the way during the plane incident not one member of public complained at me. They were all ganging up on the staff telling them not to be ridiculous and just let them off. After we got off one girl gave me a hug and said she was cheering me on the whole time and agreed that it's all about control, two young guys were on my side too saying it's all a scam good on you bro. One old man said that was very brave and congratulated me as he walked past. </p>
<p>Then everybody clapped hahahaaaa no but I swear this happened as I described above, obviously there are a few more details I missed out but I was so surprised at public reaction. I believe people are more fed up with this that we realise but most people are scared and they just need someone to nudge them in the right direction. </p>
<p>I am extremely skeptical of positive posts about people waking up but I'm just telling what happened. I was shocked. </p>
<p>I think maybe one reason could be that it was a flight from a country that was on the UK quarantine list so the type of people on the plane perhaps tended to be those who didn't give a shit about stupid rules? I have no idea.  </p>
<p>Stand up for yourselves, you might be surprised at the results.</p>

        <p>Wow! I thought I was a real mask denier, but even I didn't risk it with the airport police, those guys don't mess around.  Way to go! I'm happy to hear you got away with it, and even happier to hear people in the public sided with you openly.  What country are you from?</p>
<p>I remember protesting all of the security theater at airports in the years after 9/11 and I had several run-ins with security and airport police.  I even had the airport president come down and negotiate with me when I refused to have my hands swabbed (while surrounded by police).  None of my protests ever succeeded because I always capitulated when they threatened to arrest me. I fly frequently for work and it would have been too high a cost for me.</p>

        <p>I was coming into London. I didn't protest on borading as I don't push my luck too far in foreign countries. I took off my mask immediately after take-off and that was it. They also refused to give me any free water the entire flight. Not really related but it pissed me off and I guess it pissed them off too. </p>
<p>Nothing was said about masks until landing but two of the flight attendants took a real personal issue with me and threated me with all sorts of shit but I just stayed calm and told them "I don't have to tell you what my exemption is".</p>
<p>They said the police would be waiting for me on landing and I just sarcastically put my thumb up. The thing is I had a feeling they weren't really getting very far, either with the pilots or the airport police on the phone. They looked really pissed off and kept coming in and out the cockpit and making calls. So I kind of guessed that they were being ignored.</p>
<p>What I didn't anticipate was them stopping everyone from getting off the plane. They pulled a yellow barrier across the door and I guess I didn't realise at first. I just thought we were waiting for the steps to pull up. I realised holding everyone up is not a good look for our cause so I asked the attendant "if I put a mask on, will you let evreyone off?" He completely ignored me three times and looked me in the eyes and said "you can't threaten me". (In retrospect, is it normal to hold everyone up in these situations? It feels like an attempt to get people to turn against me? Not sure.)</p>
<p>At this point the two young dudes were calling him stupid for not understading a simple question. Security came up the steps asked what the problem was. I explained "I don't want to hold everyone up, if I put the mask on will you let everyone off?" He was sort of like "duh, of course" and gave the attendants a look. There were 5 security but I could tell the main guy was sympathetic, they took a phot of my boarding pass so they have my name, something could come of it I guess. Doubt it though.</p>
<p>OK got that off my chest.</p>

        <p>@Angelohatesjello Does your state or city have a mask mandate? Do you grocery shop and such without one? Don’t you get thrown out? Super curious to see what your experience is.</p>

        <p>I'm in London. Yes, in shops and on public transport there is a mask mandate. There is also a company imposed one at my work. I'm in and out of central London every day on the underground. I was throughout. (less so during lockdown but still once a week at least).</p>
<p>I've had a few confrontations on transport. I'm not sure why it happened this way around but I'm just saying it how it is: People were more agressive/assertive to start with. Even though I'd say only about 80% of people were complying at first. And about 5% of people were wearing masks in the open. Then slowly it became almost everyone on transport, sometimes I see one other person but most times it's just me (obviously not everyone is actullay wearing their masks, chinstraps and coughing all around!). The weirdest part is about 45% of people are wearing masks in the open now. Hot young couples in their muzzles in a 36 degree heatwave. The shop mandate came in later so that helped push more people I think. </p>
<p>Despite mask usage increasing nobody says anything to me now. There was a policeman at London Bridge a couple weeks back who asked me if I had one. I told him I was exempt, he asked what my condition was and I said I don't have to tell you and he said OK and backed away immediately! The fact that UK police are pathetic is a good thing I guess. </p>
<p>So apart from that there has been nothing in the last few weeks (in London). The public leave me alone now and I have never even been asked to put one on in a shop let alone thrown out. However I did just come back from holiday and the air stewards held everyone on the plane and tried to call the police but I think this comment is long enough. On holiday I complied with mask mandates but avoided where possible because I didn't fancy pushing my luck in a foreign country. </p>
<p>I don't expect everyone to be as not giving a fuck as I am but I do encourage it. Just do what you can. </p>
<p>I have to concede I put on a mask at work when absolutely necessary in order to keep my job but I do push the limits of that and I haven't worn one this week. I don't expect that to last though. I think the whole mask and general control is going to get a lot worse and this will probably be the hill I die on, or something.</p>

        <p>No shame in keeping your job while you have a job left to keep man. Make hay while the sun shines. </p>
<p>I took a baby step just now. We are STUPIDLY required to wear masks while entering restaurants, can take them off once seated. It’s an insult to my intelligence and I’ve had enough. I walked in And out without a mask and no one said a damn thing. I will build on this In the coming days, I think.</p>

        <p>Yeah you guys are so strong and tough</p>
<p>But you have the brain power of a single celled organism. I tell every one of you to put on a fucking mask when I see one of you degenerates in public, and most of you are losers who stutter awkwardly when anyone confeonts you about your disreguard for others.</p>
<p>I would LOVE for one of you to try to rough me up so I could shoot your rancid diseased ass dead and have all your loved ones infect each other at your mask-free funeral. But thankfully you’re in the process of genocding yourselves. Just sucks you need to take so many innocent Americans with you.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I've had an encounter not too long ago where it was clear the masker knew <em>me</em>, but I'm still not 100% sure they were who <em>I</em> thought they were as it was a brief moment involving others (also masked but easier to identify).</p>

        <p>I introduced myself to a server at my husband's restaurant that I already knew. It was awkward. But I just brushed it off, laughed and said "Masks, you know?" I have a very hard time making eye contact, a life long problem for me, so it's very difficult for me to make sense of 25% of someone's face--especially now that it's the part I struggled to really look at.</p>

        <p>Ugh, I can see how that is super strange to interact with someone every day and then have them no recognize you even though you're right in front of them. I have been interacting with other moms in my toddler's gym classes. We all have to wear masks (just the adults) so I make a habit to immediately take my mask off when I get outside after class and I strike up a conversation with one of the moms. I am able to see what they look like that way and it makes the interaction more meaningful. Unfortunately, some of the moms won't take their masks off even when we get outside.</p>

        <p>I work in a grocery store and yesterday heard a mom and her small kid (maybe 7?) talking with another woman. They were making plans to go to a lake cabin together. When the other lady walked away the kid looked at her mom and asked who that lady was. The mom just laughed and seemed confused while explaining it was so-and-so but with a mask, and it just made me sad.</p>
