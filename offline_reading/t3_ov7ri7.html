    <strong>Totally agree with the premise of this subreddit and totally am pro-choice on the vaccine but...</strong>
    <p><p>I have been against lockdowns and any mention of the new normal since March 2020. I knew it was a slippery slope that only led to one future: us begging for our rights back. </p>
<p>For full disclosure, I am fully vaccinated because there is nothing more I want than to go back to normal. They told me that if I took the Jab wed go back to normal and we all know how that turned out. </p>
<p>I fully support, and actually encourage others to not get the vaccine now. Why? Because there is legitimately no point in anyone below the age of 60 to get the vaccine. Not only does it not return us to normal, but you can still get COVID with the vaccine. </p>
<p>Let me be clear - anyone with a 99%+ chance of surviving without the vaccine shouldn't be condenmed for not taking an experimental vaccine. I would not view anyone differently for being unvaxxed, and knowing what I know now, I wouldnt take it because it turned out to not be effective, and it did not bring us back to normal.</p>
<p>Having said that, I see a lot of anti vax viewpoints here that are... a little suspect. Things like "those who got the vaccine won't be alive soon" to "the vaccine will not allow you to have kids."</p>
<p>I wish this subreddit would focus on the things everyone can get behind, like the fact humanity was coerced into getting an experimental vaccine to go back to normal only for us to not be able to, or the fact that the vaccines dont seem to work. I think as soon as we start saying things like "vaccines make you infertile" we lose alot of people who would be sympathetic to our cause because, from everything I've seen, stuff like that isnt true.</p>
<p>Therefore, I ask everyone, for the sake of our movement, to be less prone to the absolute batshit insane conspiracy theories and focus on the things we know are true:</p>
<p>Society was coerced into taking an experimental vaccine to go back to normal but normal never came.</p></p>

        <p>This sub is full of just as much fear mongering and misinformation as vaccine-friendly subs. It’s just on the other end of the spectrum. The truth lies somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>There’s definitely something sinister taking place. And it’s being shrouded by heaps of hyperbole on both sides.</p>
<p>For me, it’s not about 5G, nanobots, infertility, social credit systems, the Mark of the beast, or having my injection site slowly mutate me into magneto.</p>
<p>My body, my choice. Period. That is the hill I die on.</p>

        <p>Same here. For me, I think the vaccine is more or less safe. However, I don’t think the government or employers should ever coerce people into taking it. Ever. And since they are saying it doesn’t  work, then it means that this has nothing to do with health, but control. </p>

        <p>Note how you’re resorting to name calling because you disagree with my statements, something the vax community often does when their narrative is questioned with logic. Something usually condemned by the critical thinkers on this sub.</p>
<p>Yes, the truth is somewhere between “covid vaccines are safe and effective” and “this is stage one of implementing China’s social credit system.”</p>

        <p>I think most people are.  There was a survey done in 2015 on anti-vaxxers, back when measles outbreaks were happening.  9% of respondents did not think the MMR vaccine was safe.  So probably meaning that 9% of people didn't take the MMR.  Interestingly, it wasn't made into a political issue, but democrats were more likely to call them unsafe than republicans. </p>
<p>So that's probably your true anti-vaxx baseline.  Currently 44% of people in the US have not taken a vaccine.  That additional 35% are not anti-vaxx.   They are simply measuring risk vs reward.</p>

        <p>I disagree I am practicing censorship.</p>
<p>As we've all determined, the only way out of this is if enough people say "enough is enough."</p>
<p>Our role as the select few who seem to see through the bullshit is to educate others, and make them open their eyes. Coming in hot with extremely polarizing viewpoints (which all CURRENT science refutes) isnt the way.</p>
<p>Is it possible I drop dead from the vaccine in a few months? Sure (and I wouldnt be too mad about it if I'm being honest as long as its quick). </p>
<p>But for now, bodies dropping like flies doesnt seem like its on anyones radar. What is, is the premise of my post: Everyone was lied to, and if we just highlight all these lies, we can win people over.</p>
<p>The governments have made this very easy for us with all their lies, fear mongering, deceit, propaganda. Lets just focus on calling out all that as a priority, expand our base, make lockdowns and similar resteictions (masks, domestic passports) so unpopular no politician would ever touch them again.</p>
<p>Its why Florida, Alberta, Texas and others are doing away with all similar types of restrictions.</p>

        <p>If you think this battle can be won with the numbers our group has (id say in society we are about 10% of the population in Canada), then do it your way.</p>
<p>This ends when 51% of the population wants it to end.</p>
<p>Telling people they are going to drop dead in a few months or that they cant have kids if they take the vaccine when all available science says that neither are true is a bad way to go about this.</p>
<p>You can be anti-vax, anti-lockdown, anti-mask while being pro science. thats what we need. The one thing we cant be is anti science. </p>

        <p>If you're waiting for people to come around to their senses you'll be waiting for a looooong time. There is evidence of sperm counts being lowered and women's cycles being affected. It's even been documented post menopausal women are being affect and bleed shortly after the shot.</p>
<p>I'm pointing to the fact that when you try to redirect the conversation it NEVER works. Look at TPTB and their efforts of censorship is failing spectacularly, how much better do you think your campaign will be in light of that?</p>
<p>I'm in Texas and I've never participated in regular mask wearing or social distancing or any of that bullshit. I've had the same account since Nov 2019, how many subs do you think I've been banned from, lol? My last ban came 19 hrs ago from r/oddlysatisfying. Got another one 3 days ago from r/facepalm. I could keep going, lol. Half the time I didn't even know the sub existed.</p>
<p>In the beginning I used peer reviewed documents and studies when doomers would come to debate. I've <em>been</em> about the science bro, but nothing was ever good for the doomer. I would even use their own studies that didn't support their narrative they bought into. I think this sub has been polluted by memes more than speculation, but by no means am I suggesting they should stop or leave. Besides, can't have science without speculating, that's how science is birthed. My over all point is you cannot  tell people what they can and can't be. If someone wants to be anti-science that's none of your concern. For all you know it could be a troll, and trolls are gonna troll. What I emphasize now is everyone do them. More commonly phrased, "do you". That's the ONLY thing you have control of so seize it.</p>

        <p>I understand your concern but I respectfully disagree. self censoring is not the answer either. if you heard it causes infertility then post it. that way it can be looked into further. You never know; sometimes these things are true but require a lot more digging. And some are just a load of nonsense.</p>
<p>But everything should be on the table at this stage otherwise we're no better than those naive enough to buy the official narrative.</p>

        <p>I'm not a big fan of lumping in the possible infertility with the more unlikely possibilities. The vaccine does fuck with menstruation and there are a lot of cases showing miscarriage, so its not too much of a leap to say that infertility is a possibility.</p>

        <p>well said and well put. I think promoting the fact that normal was promised but not delivered, as well as the vaccine doesn't truly work 100% is the way to go. a lot of friends that have been vaccinated are realizing everything I've said up to now. they regret their decision but at least know not to push this agenda down people's throats. you can't fight fire with fire. in order to create peace you must promote it. for instance, if you are anti slavery, don't promote anti slavery, promote freedom. if you are anti war, promote peace etc. don't be anti, be the opposite, good end of that.</p>

        <p>&rt;  I see a lot of anti vax viewpoints here that are... a little suspect. Things like "those who got the vaccine won't be alive soon" to "the vaccine will not allow you to have kids."</p>
<p>Yup.  Hey, it's still Reddit.   You are lucky you aren't running into the 5G, and microchippers,  and "mark of the beast" crowd because they are here too. </p>
<p>The upside is that we discuss these things, or ignore them.  We don't wish concentration camps and death on them.</p>

        <p>I went to a protest in my country.</p>
<p>We had lots of speakers talking about the body autonomy, the fact we don't know long term effects, the taking of our freedoms etc</p>
<p>And then one dude came out and started talking about the elites torturing and killing children and then drinking their blood. </p>
<p>I mean, it might be true and it might not. Who knows these days eh... I've seen zero proof though and don't want to hear it when I'm fighting for freedom and to prevent my child being excluded from education unless she gets the vax. I don't give a toss about what the elites are doing. </p>
<p>But these people need to realise that someone walking past the protest who may be on the fence will hear that and then think we're all fucking nuts. I felt like booing tbh but I think the silent reaction to his words from the crowd said enough. </p>
<p>So yes, let's keep the unproven hypotheses out of the argument. We all know the facts :</p>
<ol>
<li>Vaccines injuries</li>
<li>Potential unknown long term effects</li>
<li>99.97% survive covid</li>
<li>Average age of covid death is practically the same as the average life expectancy</li>
<li>Kids are suffering mental health issues.</li>
<li>Surgeries for other conditions being canceled</li>
<li>Body autonomy</li>
<li>We are anti-fascism ( though not AntiFa, because they are fascist)</li>
<li>Media lies
10 Robert Malone</li>
</ol>
<p>I've probably missed loads. But if we stick to that shit, more people will feel welcome if they are starting to tip towards us.</p>

        <p>I share the same thoughts on the more outrageous claims. I think there is an infamous "silent majority" who are just curious why we would get a vaccine that literally does nothing against the virus it is intended to work against.</p>
