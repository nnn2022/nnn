    <strong>I've been involved with the Gamestop/Reddit experience this week. Here's how it applies to NoNewNormal</strong>
    <p><p>What I've learned, since jumping in on the Gamestop stock ruckus this week:</p>
<p>When there is a threat of change, especially if it financially affects the usual power brokers, they are going to stand up against it.  I believe this is the root of the pushback from the Capitol revolt, and why no pushback was given in the summer, when groups looted and burned cities.  No power was being transferred.</p>
<p>Additionally, the NEW NORMAL in the case of this stock/short fiasco, is that everyday, normal people can make a difference in their own finances, at the expense of the establishment.  The establishment pushed back with all their might, using government to back their actions.  In this situation, a new normal that would be better for all, but not for those in power, would have been the outcome.  The power brokers again pushed back. No "new normal" is allowed when it comes to money and the people's ability to earn it.  </p>
<p>Lastly, what is happening as a "new normal" is being pushed in the form of mandatory vaccinations and constant fear-mongering and threats, is another step toward total and complete control.  It isn't about race, it isn't about states rights, it isn't about any of those things.  It is a class war.  Rules for thee, but not for me.  The ruling class feels threatened by outsiders.  You, me, others.  They will allow us to believe it's about race or culture or dem vs. repub.  It's really about them keeping their seats at the head of the table.  A new normal is needed.  But it's not the one that they are pushing for.  No New Normal indeed.  In fact, much of the old normal needs to be rocked.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.  Just my honest opinion from this week's activities.</p></p>

        <p>Well done to you. Don’t understand finance at all but my impression is that you’ve given them shocks and scares on the stocks and shares. MSM reporting and and exposure of the hypocrisy currently on show.</p>

        <p>Yes it is.  They have been exposed once again.  The old way of doing things, shorting stocks of a company, until that company and all of it's employees are rendered into oblivion, has been challenged.  Their OLD WAY of ripping off the world by shorting a stock has been met head on.  Some of us are calling them out on that.  Millions in fact.  And they have used outright illegal practices to get around it.  They aren't winning, as most of us will not be derailed.  We are buying the stocks of these heavily shorted companies, and HOLDING them.  Not giving in to their panics they can cause with their sheer size.  </p>
<p>Much in the same way that CNN, MSNBC, and, well, frankly ALL of the MSM have done this past year with fear tactics.  Trouble is, they had a central goal of disposing of a President they deemed an "outsider", and I, myself, consider myself an OUTSIDER to the big shitlords of Wall Street.</p>

        <p>Oh, no doubt.  In fact, I’ve commented that I expect some major “accident” or major news story involving loss of life or of great human interest, will come soon, diverting everyone’s attention yet again.</p>
<p>This is easy, and it’s the way MSM works now.  Push a narrative, until victory, then move on to the next thing quickly.</p>

        <p>Don’t know if you’re also in the UK but there was a sitcom called The Thick Of It that skewered the role of media spin in politics, featuring Peter Capaldi as a pastiche of Alasdair Campbell. I’m really starting to think that it was a warning for things to come.</p>

        <p>I'm not a leftist (libertarian / classical liberal, and a pretty radical one at that) nor do I single-handidly choose the moderators.</p>
<p>Some are liberal, some are moderate, some are right wing, some are apolitical, many arent American (including me). They are more liberal on average because so is reddit. There is no liberal conspiracy.</p>
<p>Automod shadowbans arent only for spammers. As far as I know theyre only used for ban evaders.</p>

        <p>A very large majority of the funds that these major hedge funds control are 401ks. Blackrock, slate street, vanguard, etc. and their CEOs get their compensation based on how well the 401ks do... which are based on how well the sp500 does which is based on how much $ the fed prints and allows these large corporations to buy their own stock back which pushes the price higher causing the sp500 to go higher which makes the hedge funds look better. It is a giant circle jerk that ALL revolves around 401ks staying in their control. Very few hedge funds other than Brown Brothers Harriman and a few others control private $.</p>

        <p>I've been watching the GME stuff for a while but never got in on it, because I felt certain that TPTB would stop at nothing to put an end to it. Look at all the brokers preventing buying/calls at the moment - that's only the start of what will happen to the retail investors, because they have no power compared to the people in charge. In a fair market, buying GME would absolutely be a good decision, but the market is not fair. They will fuck over the little guys far worse by the time this ends. There's no way they will allow people to get away with making money off the elite like this.</p>

        <p>They’re gonna use this to usher in their controlled collapse so they can come in and save the day, (great reset) and everyone will be begging for it, and I think they used these Reddit and other guys to do it. </p>
<p>In other words, my gut says this was a setup. So the little guy may be cheering today, but I think they’ve sealed their, and more importantly, all our fate. That’s not to say the reset wouldn’t have happened otherwise, but how else were they gonna get people on board. I think the momentum will build from here on out.</p>

        <p>Agreed. This smells off, and it's right in line with the script. I don't know who exactly is responsible for this, but I think their goal is to accelerate and collapse everything, not get a win for the little guy. There's too much coverage, too much hype, too many high budget memes coming out.</p>
<p>It feels a lot like the same force that was behind the whole "meme warfare" thing back in 2015. The glow-in-the-dark "how do you do fellow anon" types.</p>

        <p>Even if the name is catchy, this IS the normal. It's hard to get it, because most, if not all, have been indoctrinated in Governmental camps, also known as schools.</p>
<p>This is what Governments do. Extracting value through force. And they sometimes need to use fear to protect the elite from the actions of the rest. This is the normal since 1914. Sure, Concentration Camps like in Germany seem quite a shocker, but they aren't in any way special. Migrants have received this sort of welcome long before.</p>

        <p>I have to ask though, what value is extracted by killing businesses? If no cash is flowing, no taxes are being levied. If people aren't employed, they don't pay taxes. I'm not paying taxes this year due to not making any money, I'll probably make more in my refund than I would've paid if I did.</p>

        <p>Because you seem to have forgotten what they have taught you.</p>
<p>The Big Brother says he has listened with great interest the Representatives from Puerto Rico. And he is willing to make a road from Chicago to Puerto Rico passing through Honolulu. Hence, the resources, like with any Hive, will be directed to make such a wonderful construction, fit for a Great Empire.</p>
<p>People on the other side don't care about food and clothing. They are the people of the Governmental Gospel. Hence they feed on abstractions: $25/h minimal wage, "Education" (whatever that means), "Equality", "Anti-Discrimination". Nobody in the administration cares about the price of potatoes. Why? Because 1. they get it for free along with the meat. 2. they can sign a decree to say nobody can sell potatoes for more than 25c/lb or be decapitated in the Parking of the Mall.</p>

        <p>Right but without taxes they have no leverage to build said road across the ocean. No value can be created without value invested. On top of that, who builds the roads? Again with nobody working, nobody's building. Nobody's building, nobody gets paid. You can argue that sitting at home consuming means that they're depleting their wealth with less incidentals, it forces people to dig into their "secret" savings so that everyone is left with nothing and more controllable. But even control is nothing if they're not getting labor out of us. </p>
<p>Unless, of course, they believe that everything that needs to be built is built and now it's time for all the slaves to die off and leave the remains for them. In which they would've made sure Corona was a real killer. I guess you have to deplete them of their cash as consumption first otherwise you declare them bankrupt and nobody gets their gold.</p>

        <p>Simply: a card shark is holding a bad hand, and all the other players at the table have gathered the aces and kings.</p>
<p>More complex: a pool of investment money placed a bet on a stock they don’t own( a short), betting that the stock would go down, so they could buy it at the cheap price.  This would mean that the company who issued the stock, GameStop, would likely have lost so much market value, that some of their ability to continue doing business selling video games and shit, would be threatened.  Reddit investors decided to call them out on the short, and started buying shares, which lifts the price.  That pool of investment dollars, called a hedge fund in this case, cannot afford to buy the stock needed to cover their bet, at this price.  The bet expires at some point very soon, meaning they will have to pay to cover their bet (short).</p>
<p>Why did Reddit investors care, you may ask?  Because these hedge funds make their money by placing bets, and they most often win.  They are not only predicting the downfall of a business, but all of the employees, owners, and customers of that business.  GameStop is not the only stock currently in this situation.  Other well known companies such as Blackberry-BB, American Movie Cinema -AMC, Nokia -NOK, and a few others I can’t remember.</p>

        <h2>I am a part of history.</h2>
<p>I've invested in Nokia, GNUS, AMC (just today on cash app), &amp; GPRO. I had a call in GNUS &amp; NOK that was over $200 each before closing yesterday, now those profits are nearly gone due to market manipulation. So many common folk like me got screwed over in this bloodbath.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't call it Reddit. I would call it a group of people in reddit. I wouldn't be surprised if the "regulators" made these kind of trade actions a violation and "reddit" bans the sub.  </p>
<p>Reddit is not your friend, just a platform some people can discuss things until it's deemed evil.</p>

        <p>They dismissed us when we said relying on centralized social media was bad for society. Now the same thing is happening, but with people's ability to make money. They are effectively getting censored much like people on Twitter are. I think this will make crypto and blockchain much more popular and viable.</p>

<p>It is us against the elites.</p>
<p>Those who haven't figured that out yet, are probably part of that upper crust experience, at least for now.  They are being brought along with the fold, until they are no longer useful.</p>
