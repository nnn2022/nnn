        <p>Pharma has been coming after supplements for years. It started a few years ago with a coordinated smear campaign about how they weren't "approved" and could be doing god-knows-what to you. Also noticed many attempts to draw attention to the miniscule number of deaths from supplements and other natural remedies, as if pharmaceuticals don't kill hundreds of thousands of people each year. Guess the plan is moving forward</p>

<p>Stop the Massive Attack on Supplements<br>
Proper supplementation is crucial to maintaining optimal health. But the FDA is working on a policy that would remove tens of thousands of supplements from the market while also threatening the ability of the industry to innovate. Contrary to the law, the agency is trying to create a pre-approval system for new supplements similar to what is required for drugs. Read our coverage for more details on the many things that are wrong with the FDA’s policy.<br>
The FDA’s real aim, in our view, is to destroy supplement innovation in the hope that this will eventually destroy the supplement industry—a major gift to the pharmaceutical industry, to which the FDA is beholden. It is part of a wider attack on natural alternatives to drugs that cannot go through the FDA approval process because they are not patentable as new-to-nature drugs are. This excludes safe and effective medicines form mainstream medical care and seems designed to protect drug monopolies.<br>
Sign our petition that seeks to reform a healthcare system that blocks access to natural treatments, including supplements.</p>

        <p>It was linked to on the <a href="https://Mercola.com">Mercola.com</a> website as one of the organizations he supports. <a href="https://anh-usa.org">This</a> is their home page with other petitions as well.  The supplement one hits close to home because they recently illegalized NAC, one of my go-to supplements.  (It's particularly effective for lung conditions.)  Anyway, do as you feel is right of course.</p>
