    <strong>There's a way out of this mess, and the government is too stupid or too malicious to see that.</strong>
    <p><p>First, let's say that there are two groups of people: pro-lockdowners and anti-lockdowners. Let's fairly assume that for the foreseeable future there will always be these two camps.</p>
<p>Second, let's say that the spread of covid is due to these two camps mingling. After all besides faulty tests what else could it be? Either the pro-lockdowners aren't locking down as hard as they seem to be spouting off, or this is something that cannot be controlled by lockdowns in which case there is no point to lockdowns. Let's assume that it's because of the former, for the sake of argument. Pro-lockdowners love to blame anti-lockdowners for the spread of covid. Anti-lockdowners don't give a shit either way.</p>
<p>So what could we possibly do? If only there was some way to set things right! If our governments weren't fucking retarded they would realize the benefit of the following:
1. Big box stores remain as-is. Heavy restrictions, heavy regulations, "safe" spaces. They have the money. This is to appease the pro-lockdowners.
2. Small businesses open. Regulations are at their discretion. If you're a restaurant owner and want to open at full capacity fuck yeah go for it. Sorry pro-lockdowners, if you don't want to enjoy a delicious plate of chinese food then that's now 100% your decision. You either continue to miss out on life or you nut up, but the choice is yours.</p>
<p>In this manner you potentially reduce the spread because those incredibly smart and not at all egotistical pro-lockdowners will be mingling only with each other, far moreso than the way it is now, meanwhile us naughty bastards get to spread covid amongst ourselves and risk the negligible chance of dying. Small businesses can operate, people's lives aren't cast aside.</p>
<p>Of course, it isn't fully normal, but I don't hate the idea of big box stores suffering a little bit. This is sustainable, and if we have to do something like a lockdown then this is how it should work and I'll die on that hill. If you think this is a good idea sound off, maybe there's a petition we can get going or something, or an open letter that I would happily write and open source.</p></p>

        <p>I agree with your post and think that's a solid plan! I've always said if any doomer or anyone is scared, they should wear their mask and lock themselves in their closet while everyone else can go about their lives normally</p>

        <p>This is what they should have done in the first place (left restrictions to private business). Many stores had already added restrictions and mask mandates before our local mandate went into place. There would be less pushback if it was left to the free market. </p>
<p>And yes- you‚Äôd think they would be happy if we would stick to our own kind?? That way we would only be ‚Äúkilling‚Äù ourselves? ü§£</p>
