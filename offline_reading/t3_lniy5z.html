        <p>The political left acts on emotion and regurgitates whatever they are fed while we on the political right look at the facts and history to make determinations, which makes us look like the crazies. Scientists are often funded by big business who also have politicians from either side in their pockets, so yes. They may very well be part of the conspiracies.</p>

        <p>The thing is most scientists work for big business &amp; big businesses mostly benefit from right wing policy. So logic tells us these scientists would have a right wing bias if any bias at all. That’s the thing that doesn’t really hold up with me.

        <p>Big business donors and beneficiaries exist on both sides. A big example right now is that Biden cancelled the Keystone XL pipeline for environmental reasons. However, the oil is still moving by railway, which is now owned by Warren Buffett who is a major Democrat/Biden donor. The potential environmental impact and emissions from moving it by rail are far greater than the pipeline but nobody want to discuss that.</p>

        <p>It's the rejection of corporate science meant to satusfy corporate interests, or when policy making by the people's will is circumvented in the name of sciece, or when certain scientific researchers are promoted while others are suppressed. The Great Barrington Declaration should help you understand.</p>

        <p>Scientists have financial incentives just like anyone else, they are not objective. Depending on how a scientific study is designed, you can come up with any result. Of course scientists are going to design studies that will lead to more career opportunities for themselves, which of course are those studies that fit into a particular narrative. I don't know what this has to do with the political right, it is simply true. The real question is why do liberals worship science? They love to talk about trust the science, but do not understand how science works. </p>
<p>Scientists are not necessarily lying all the time but it is naive to believe that they are all pure searchers of truth.</p>

        <p>I am not sure if thats true, I think pharma has benefited a lot from the vaccines and I would not be surprised if peoples addictions have gotten worse during this, which would also benefit pharma. Also, not all scientists work for pharma, many work for government agencies and universities.</p>

        <p>There is no widespread rejection of scientific evidence among the right any more than there is a widespread movement of white nationalists among them. In this case just like with the coronavirus and what we see on TV, your perception is not reality.</p>
<p>I don’t believe the scientists as a whole are part of any conspiracy either, to lie to the American people. Now there have been plenty of proven instances of scientists lying for financial gain, but there are also crooked corrupt FBI agents, and that’s not the norm either.</p>
<p>An uncomfortable fact for the left and many Redditors is that as Americans age they dramatically become more right wing. Are we supposed to believe that as people gain life experiences that they become dumber? Just like Mormons flee their church at high numbers when they hit 30, DemocRATs do the same thing. Nearly every mother I know in my age range of 40 was a flaming liberal before they got married and had kids and started making money. So how does this relate to what you call a rejection of scientific evidence and consensus?</p>
<p>When I was in the first grade in the early 80s more than one teacher, scientist, and presentation planted into my mind that the earth would run out of oil in the next 30 years. Well it’s been 40 and there’s no end in sight.</p>
<p>At the same time I was hearing about how we were going to run out of oil I was hearing about global cooling. You can go on YouTube and find preeminent scientists and climatologists from the late 70s and early 80s telling the American people with a straight face that we were a decade or two away from an Ice Age and we caused it. That didn’t come true either by the way, and those same doomers switched to global warming over the years and then when that didn’t pan out they said hey let’s just call it climate change and blame it on humans which ever direction it goes.</p>
<p>Al Gore told me Miami would be underwater by now. </p>
<p>That wacko Bill the alleged science guy, suddenly starts telling the world there’s more than one biological gender. The same doctors and AMA that categorized some transsexuals as mentally ill for decades now tell us that it’s perfectly normal to want to cut your dick off and call yourself a woman.</p>
<p>Lobotomies, leeches, bleeding, were all settled science at one point. Thalidomide anyone? </p>
<p>What you see as rejection of evidence we see as questioning the same voices that have lied to or misled us countless times either through malice or incompetence or just being wrong. It would be stupid to just take their word on anything. </p>
<p>I believe in science, and so far the science says the mortality rate for high risk people is about 1.5% and 0% for the rest of the world.</p>

        <p>It's not a be all end all absolute. Rejection of science happens on both sides, it's more of a question of which science gets rejected by which political group. </p>
<p>Not my example so I'm paraphrasing, but take the field of biology.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you look at evolution and natural selection, you are more likely to find right-leaning people rejecting it. This is because historically there's been an overlap between religion (which traditionally rejects evolution) and the right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, if you follow the field of biological psychology - which supposes that all of our behavior, development, etc - is entirely driven by biology first, it will be the left who will challenge you. Think of the concept of gender norms in society - the science here will claim that it is entirely physiological, however, the left will reject this science and claim that biology is wrong.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So really, this is something that is shared by all political spectrums. Nobody has a monopoly on being the "party of science."</p>

        <p>There is a link between the American right wing and skepticism of overreaching government authority, which developed over the course of the late 2000's as the neocons fell completely out of favor thanks to the disastrous wars in the ME. The US, moreso than most countries, was founded on the idea that one central authority should not run every aspect of people's lives. The idea that someone like ~~King~~ Dr. Fauci, a man who has never met me and possibly never been within 100 miles of me, knows what is best for me and my family is an idea that the American right generally rejects. </p>
<p>There is no rejection of science in that, merely a rejection of religious authority masquerading as science, often ridiculed on this and other subs as "The ScienceTM". Science is not a dogmatic set of beliefs that must be accepted completely and without question. Additionally, science (real science) does not say anything about morality, so the fact that people are using The ScienceTM to make moral arguments is seen for the foolish notion that it is</p>
<p>Also, if you want to see if someone follow The ScienceTM or considers actual science, ask them what the difference between a man and a woman is, or whether it is possible to be healthy at 350 pounds</p>

        <p>Real scientific evidence and consensus flew out the window in 2020. Many of us lean left or did before 2020.</p>
