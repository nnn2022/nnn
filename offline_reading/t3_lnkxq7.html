    <strong>We live in a society of great hypocrisy</strong>
    <p><p>The way most people act during the covid "pandemic" is but a mere symptom of the degeneracy of our morals. We care more about appearances than we do about essence.</p>
<p>We value feelings more than the truth. No matter how cliche the phrase "Facts don't care about your feelings" has recently become it describes adequately the dystopia which we are living in.</p>
<p>Masks make people feeeeeeel safe and ultimately that's all that matters! As soon as the cameras get turned off the double masks are taken off easily as well. It's all about raising awareness about safety and public health and promoting a feeling of safety and blah blah blah just  not about real safety or hygine. </p>
<p>One cannot host a large party at his house even if all the attendants get tested beforehand. Why? Because it's not actual safety and prevention of disease that matters but everything seeming and feeling  safe.</p>
<p>That's the reason perfectly healthy people are been "quarantinated" and muzzled.</p>
<p>And that's the reason we will continue wearing masks even after the "vaccine" and possibly ad infinitum. Because some people don't care about facts but about feeeeeeeeling safe.</p></p>

        <p>Did you see that pic with the press and Politicans/ Biden. None of the press and most of the people there aren’t wearing masks or they are pulled down... ON FEDERAL GROUNDS. Pure hypocrisy, these people obviously don’t think this is dangerous or they think masks don’t word or else they’d follow their own mandates.</p>
