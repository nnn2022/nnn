        <p>People are now speculating it may even show masks are bad, e.g.:</p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://twitter.com/boriquagato/status/1319018642730831873">lancet, JAMA, and NEJM all refusing to publish the DANMASK study. this was the largest &amp; best controlled study (really the only RCT) on society scale clinical outcomes from masks. my money is on "masks showed harm". even just not working would not elicit this kind of censorship</a></p>
<p>Leaving people to speculate wildly about the results may cause even more damage than simply allowing people to see them.</p>

        <p>RCTs are the gold standard of scientific studies (other than systematic reviews that analyze the results of multiple RCTs). They are the only type of study that provides evidence of causation in actual use. </p>
<p>RCTs on masks overwhelmingly show no effectiveness; this one very likely shows the same. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the studies used to “prove” masks are effective are lesser studies - observational studies (highly subject to bias/cherry picking; can only show correlation, never causation) and lab simulations (conducted under completely unrealistic circumstances) and modeling (based on assumptions and more of a “guess” than evidence). </p>
<p>RCTs, particularly multiple RCTs and systematic reviews of them, are NEVER outweighed by observational studies or lab sims. </p>
<p>If masks were a drug, there is not a licensed doctor on the planet who would prescribe them to a patient based on the current body of evidence.</p>

        <p>Can anyone provide a translation or even just the text of the article on Berlingske?</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
The Berlingske article is here: https://www.berlingske.dk/videnskab/professor-stort-dansk-maskestudie-afvist-af-tre-top-tidsskrifter</p>
<p>I cannot access the full text but the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/jfvouj/professor_large_danish_mask_study_rejected_by/">thread at r/coronavirus</a> contains the following automatic google translation (slightly edited to improve the quality and readability):</p>
<p>&rt;   The researchers behind a large and unique Danish study on the effect of wearing a mask are having great difficulty in getting their research results published. One of the participating professors in the study admits that the still secret research results can be perceived as "controversial."</p>
<p>&rt;   For weeks, media and researchers around the world have been waiting with increasing impatience for the publication of a large Danish study on the effect — or lack thereof — of wearing a mask in public spaces here during the corona pandemic.</p>
<p>&rt;   Now, one of the researchers who has been involved in the study can state that the finished research result has been rejected by at least three of the world's leading medical journals. These include The Lancet, The New England Journal of Medicine, and the American Medical Association's journal JAMA.</p>
<p>&rt;    "They all said no," says professor Christian Torp-Pedersen, Dr. and chief physician at the research department at North Zealand Hospital.
&rt;    However, the professor does not want to share the reasons for the journals' rejection.
&rt;    "We cannot start discussing what they are dissatisfied with because in that case we must also explain what the study showed and we do not want to discuss that until it is published," explains Christian Torp-Pedersen.</p>
<p>&rt;   <strong>Outstanding study</strong></p>
<p>&rt;    The study was initiated at the end of April after a grant of five million kroner from the Salling Foundations. It involved as many as 6,000 Danes, half of whom had to wear masks in public over a long period of time. The other half was selected as the control group.
&rt;    A large part of the test participants were employees of Salling Group's supermarkets: Bilka, Føtex and Netto.</p>
<p>&rt;    The study and its size are unique in the world, and the purpose was to, once and for all, try to clarify the extent to which the use of sanitary masks in public space provides protection against corona infection.
&rt;    If the Danish research result is truly "controversial" and if that means that no evidence has been found of any major infection-protecting effect of mask use in public space, it will be highly startling.</p>
<p>&rt;    But of course it cannot be ruled out that the three medical journals are of the opinion that the data obtained by the Danish study is deficient — that, for example, there are too few coronavirus infections in the study to be able to draw unambiguous conclusions about the protective effect of masks against infection with the new virus.
&rt;    In this connection, it is worth noting that the study was conducted at a time (predominantly in May), when the infection pressure in Denmark was falling sharply.</p>
<p>&rt;   The study's spokesman and main author is professor of cardiology and chief physician at Rigshospitalet, Henning Bundgaard. He strongly emphasizes that he wants to be in charge of "high-quality" research.</p>

<p>&rt; A lead investigator on the Danish mask study - the ONLY (as far as I know) randomized trial to see if masks protect from #COVID - was asked when it would be published.</p>
<p>&rt; His answer: “as soon as a journal is brave enough.”</p>

        <p>I said exactly that in another thread where the Danishead researcher had twittered he was waiting for a journal brave enough to publish. There are multiple other studies that showed cloth masks were harmful when compared with no masks, so it wouldn't even be a surprise if that was the case.</p>

        <p>it's time for samizdat, comrades:</p>
<p>&rt;the clandestine copying and distribution of literature banned by the state, especially formerly in the communist countries of eastern Europe</p>
<p>we all know that this study had three possible outcomes: good, bad, and inconclusive.</p>
<p>we know that if the results were "good" or "inconclusive" (at best), this study would have been published MONTHS ago.</p>
<p>the only reason they are holding this back is because it disagrees with the popular social/political narrative, and they've got nothing else. if this comes out, the masks come off.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Ayjchan/status/1318969676886573058?s=20">these scientists don't want to be blackballed for life, but if their research is published and shows to be contrary to the facts that have been shoved down our throats for the last seven months, it will be disastrous for science.</a> science should never ever be political, or religious. don't weaponize the science.</p>
<p>it's time to go old-school Soviet style and get this study circulating in the right hands. print copies, pdf copies, read the fucking thing on AM radio, a podcast, whatever it takes.</p>
<p>i think its emergence is imminent, since it's now splashed all over the news and social media, and there's no denying the study is out there now. the powers-that-be can't hide it anymore.</p>
<p>it also helps that the Danes are a no BS, hardy people, and they won't stand for this gaslighting. thank god for the Vikings, y'all.</p>
<p>i cannot believe that we're being told we can't listen to scientists like Dr. John Ioannidis; i went to university with people who would have committed high treason for the opportunity to study with him and work with him, to be in the same room as him. people who only applied to graduate programs at Stanford just for the chance to see him. WHAT THE FUCK.</p>
<p>now TPTB are telling us that Drs Ioannidis, Gupta, Bhattacharya, Kulldorff, Sikora, Levitt, Mizrachi, Atlas can't be trusted? that they're wrong? that they're misguided alt-right crazies now? the most respected people in their field?!?</p>
<p>that we should instead ONLY listen to Lord Fauci (thanks be to Fauci, it is right to give him praise), Saint Birx, "Dr" Eric "lol i'm not even board certified!" Ding and Bill "i didn't even fucking graduate from college" Gates and Andy "15 dAyS tO sLoW tHe SpReAd!" Slavitt and Scott "trust me Pfizer will save us" Gottlieb and Carl "IT LIVES IN THE SUNSHINE" Bergstrom because the world has lost its mind and fallen into a sick mass psychosis?</p>
<p>... ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!</p>

        <p>Really even if it comes out, which the major journals probably won't accept, the media and the clerics of science (the Faucis, etc..) will find ways to discredit it.  That's the problem with medicine or other soft science.  You can always pick a variable and put doubt into people's minds.  "Oh, but they didn't test them around a dense enough population.". Just saying something ridiculously superficial like that and repeating it enough puts doubt in people's minds and can discredit the entire study.
This is where the media has an advantage.  They control truth and employ willing scientists to back up their version of truth with their "expertise."</p>

        <p>The media can definitely crush it, it's very easy to do.  The reason doesn't even need to be scientific or.make sense (look what Fauci says).  And the journal will be in the spotlight in a bad way for publishing it.  I think that's why no one wants to publish it.</p>

        <p>The barbara streisand effect is well known: they know that they are MAKING a much bigger story here by refusing to publish it. That absolutely factors into their decision-making. </p>
<p>So the optimal route for them here is publish and discredit - that best minimizes the story and maintains the narrative. If they are choosing to not do that, it is because they specifically doubt it will work - which is the <em>only</em> reason to gamble on the very risky strategy of suppression.</p>

        <p>It's not a big enough audience to have a Barbara Streisand effect. They can just ignore it and when it comes out somehow in a lower level journal they can make up a reason why they didn't accept it then and then discredit it.  It's very easy to do and since they are the "prestigious journals" people will accept it.</p>
