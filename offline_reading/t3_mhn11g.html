    <strong>April 1st, 2022</strong>
    <p><p>There was this thing called Covid that came to my town years ago. The TV lady said it was bad, so we stopped everything to hide. Everyone was just so scared, we didn't know what to do. We didn't want grandma to die, so we didn't visit her anymore. Grandma was lonely, but also too prudent to meet anyone. She watched the TV everyday, waiting for good news. A year later, she got the vaccine, but we were still told to avoid social contact. Then not long after, vaccine-resistant mutations of the virus spread, so grandma spent another year hiding.</p>
<p>Recently, grandma passed away. At first, we suspected it was Covid, but it wasn't. As it turns out, grandma was just too old. Maybe she could've survived a few more years if it wasn't all the stress and depression from the last couple years, but we wouldn't know. All we know is that when trying to add more days to Grandma's life, we ended up taking the life out of her last days.</p></p>

<p>depression can make wonders in accelerating the elderly's fall; old peeps just stop feeding themselves, and with no energy left in their bodies they can't even fight simple infections anymore.</p>

        <p>There's an old saying that having grandkids will lengthen your parent's lives. I dont know if it's mental or physical, but trigerring that caretaking instinct in your parents again might put their bodies back into hunter/gatherer mode</p>
<p>Theres also a story i heard about old people retiring from a job they did their entire lives and passing away within 2 years of retiring. </p>
<p>I guess when you have nothing to live for, you stop living</p>
