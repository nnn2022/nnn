    <strong>A Kind Message to All The Doomers Who Lurk and Hate on this Sub.</strong>
    <p><p>I posted a comment here, and I got 7 nonsense replies and 2 dms. All of hate and accusations. I go on these people's profiles and guess what? They are all active on the same Doomer subs. Well, I have to say something to you doomers.</p>
<p>Get a life. Rather than whining and complaining about Us, do something productive with your lives and try to change the situation that we're in. All you guys do is complain and say, "Because of YOU guys, my 92 year old Grandma died of covid" well you dummy, she was bound to die anyway. No fucking one lives forever. For her to live 2 weeks more, you guys have destroyed everything. The economy, mental sanity and what not. Heck where I live, The gyms still haven't been open up since last year. Like WTF? The irony is, most of you haven't seen or cared about grandma in forever, yet you come here and virtue signal us that we're "killing" grandma? You dumb fucks are too busy in quad masking with them hazmat suits on, because you fear everything. And you're also afraid of meeting grandma or just anyone, yet, when it comes to things such as the BLM riots or whatever, then somehow, it's good to go out and protest huh with huge crowds? And if we have an anti-lockdown protest somehow we're evil and "causing the spread?" You guys are the textbook definition of hypocrites. Just stfu by super gluing those mask on your faces and keep your nonsense to yourselves. You guys lack common sense and logic, and we all know this.</p>
<p>Also subs like r/Nonewnormalban and r/NonewNormalbanban have been created to shun this sub. Those mods there and their supporters are the biggest jokes. Who tf has time to create a sub to ban a sub? Idk who these people are tbh. Rather than whining, do something! We? We say facts here and share the truth, which you doomers will never comprehend. We say it all with right sources and no nonsense facts. </p>
<p>You doomers need a life. Most of us here dgaf about your subs. We stay only here and I'm glad this sub exists. It makes me realize that, there are still some logical people left in the world. You doomers on the other hand keep whining of that guy who didn't quad mask or your 92 year old grandma who had cancer, but "somehow" died from covid. Like????? Nobody gaf. Keep sucking and worshipping that Fauchi fk doll and your pro covid saviours. We are least bothered about you, and please don't bother any of us. Unfortunately, many subs now are banning you automatically just for saying anything here. Don't worry about them. It just shows that who the sheep are. They go go fuck themselves with their masks and experimental vaccines.</p>
<p>Edit: Last thing the mods here are the real OGs üëèüëèüëè. You guys are always on point and doing a great job. Keep it up!</p></p>

        <p>Very few unvaccinated people with strong minds and sensible nutritional intake, have experienced any strife from Covid.   The ‚ÄúDoomers‚Äù, on the other hand, are actually the perpetrators of the whole turd.  I hope you see this comment doomer!  I want you to look at yourself in the mirror and think about it.  Give it at least 20 minutes.</p>
