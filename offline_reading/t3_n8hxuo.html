    <strong>Canada is freaking me out.</strong>
    <p><p>Any Americans in states with "Regulations lifted " willing to help a Canadian that might need to make some form of emergency visit in the coming months ? Advice or tips of any kind are welcome.</p>
<p>but also, anyone with info/thoughts on other countries that could be safe from this fascist shit... i'm all ears. </p>
<p>I'm a Canadian citizen who doesn't have a lot of ties to staying here other then some of the obvious basics. I understand a lot of different areas are going though similar things, but what's creeping in here is extremely concerning and I really don't know what to do. It's no joke to uproot your life... but it's complete brainwash here and I can't see it going back.</p>
<p>help.</p></p>

        <p>I’m in an open state (Oklahoma); happy to answer questions...</p>
<p>If I were a Canadian I would be moving to America. I moved cross country from a brainwashed lockdown state to an open one. It was difficult and expensive. I don’t regret it all.</p>
<p>I’d recommend Florida, Georgia, Texas and Arizona - because they have rather robust economies. </p>
<p>I’m actually concerned about Canada closing its borders entirely and not letting y’all leave. That’s what dictatorships do... that could be years away tho. </p>
<p>But if you have no ties to Canada - I do think it would be foolish to rest on the assumption that things will return to normal any time soon. It could be years if ever.</p>
