    <strong>My brother‚Äôs school has the weirdest anti-COVID measure I‚Äôve ever heard of.</strong>
    <p><p>So Boris Johnson partially caved in to the demands of the teaching unions by leaving COVID policy, such as if and where wearing masks will be required, up to individual head teachers. My brother is due to go back to school next week, and I think his school‚Äôs COVID policy takes the cake. The fact that he‚Äôll have to wear a mask in corridors is a little insane but unsurprising, but get this.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm going to drumroll this because you won‚Äôt actually believe it ü•Å</p>
<p><strong>The school is keeping every window and fire door open during school hours.</strong></p>
<p>Bear in mind that not only will this continue until there‚Äôs a vaccine - so potentially the entire winter - but the school announced this policy during a time of unseasonable cooling in which we are experiencing some of the coldest August temperatures on record.</p>
<p>Also, you want to know how many COVID deaths there have been in our county? 409. Out of 41,486 in the whole country. Less than 1% of the total deaths happened in a county with 2.4% of the population. Most of those were in our one big city, and yet schools in the small towns are doing stuff like this. Spare me.</p></p>

        <p>I thought you were supposed to always keep fire doors shut?! It's a safety hazard to keep them open as part of the function of a fire door is to keep fire limited to certain sections of the building (compartmentation).</p>

        <p>Yeah, that‚Äôs what I thought too. Fire safety was a huge deal at my school. I got detention for accidentally walking out of a fire door and causing a drill once.</p>

        <p>I'm a building operations manager at a college, one of our faculty said in a meeting the other day that she "read somewhere" (nice source) that doors and windows should be kept open at temperatures above 50F (10C)</p>
<p>The fuck?  This was like 5 minutes after I explained to the entire faculty that our recently-renovated HVAC system is designed to draw in large amounts of outdoor air and runs it through a filtration system that is strong enough to filter out viruses.  Our campus health services director was on the call too and basically told her to take the tinfoil hat off lol</p>
<p>I don't think these people realize how stupid and ridiculous they sound.  Same teacher also asked if we should be flushing the toilets (the virus can live in the toilet bowl and the aerosols go all over the room when you flush!), and "what should we do if a student pulls down their mask to sneeze?" (health services director said she had "never heard of that happening and can't imagine it would be an issue")</p>

        <p>Our school decided to shut off the air conditioning because apparently the filters in the HVAC system don't work. So now we're sitting in 85 degree classrooms (sometimes hotter depending on location) with our masks on. And they don't allow us access to water either, which I thought was illegal.</p>

        <p>I don't get this attitude, why would anyone want to go to school to be forced to wear a muzzle and not be allowed to socialise with your friends anyway?  You'd be better off just inviting your friends round and studying at home, if you want to learn, until this insanity goes away for good.  It's exactly as I've told my office - I'm not going in until things are completely normal, until that time I'd rather stay at home - even though I quite enjoy being in the office (sometimes).</p>
