    <strong>Can we revisit a conspiracy theory in regards to the pandemic measures?</strong>
    <p><p>Okay, this isn’t about the pandemic at large. There’s hundreds of things to be said, and there’s surely no conspiracy about that. </p>
<p>What I’d like to readdress is the alleged ‘Morgellons Parasites’.</p>
<p>From (https://www.elanafreeland.com/post/morgellons-fibers-discovered-in-face-masks)</p>
<p>&rt; If you haven't heard about Morgellons in a while, you may be surprised that people are finding its filaments in the recommended masks AND the swabs for CV-19. This makes sense in that (1) the fibers are everywhere, and (2) Morgellons (with the cross-domain bacteria or CDB), following Lyme as a chemical-biological warfare pathogen, is the initial groundwork for the neural network in the body and brain that HYDROGEL now completes and the 3-STRIKES-YOU'RE-OUT VACCINE, SWAB "TEST," AND POSSIBLY THE MASKS provide the software OS for. The iron / erythrocyte / oxygen / coagulation similarity is a key clue. </p>
<p>Posted by Rice University in 2015 (http://news.rice.edu/2015/03/25/carbon-nanotube-fibers-make-superior-links-to-brain-2/)</p>
<p>&rt; Because they provide a two-way connection, they show promise for treating patients with neurological disorders while monitoring the real-time response of neural circuits in areas that control movement, mood and bodily functions.</p>
<p>And further</p>
<p>&rt; New experiments at Rice demonstrated the biocompatible fibers are ideal candidates for small, safe electrodes that interact with the brain’s neuronal system, according to the researchers. They could replace much larger electrodes currently used in devices for deep brain stimulation therapies in Parkinson’s disease patients.</p>
<p>They may also advance technologies to restore sensory or motor functions and brain-machine interfaces as well as deep brain stimulation therapies </p>
<p>Keywords &amp; phrases: ‘monitoring the real time neural circuits that control movement, mood, and bodily functions’</p>
<p>‘Brain-machine interfaces’ </p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/ghQl8m61hYY">Examining face mask with microscope </a></p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/poxA2DxdiQI">Examination of said parasite</a></p>
<p>In this examination, done by an anonymous telegram user, I took him through a series of questions to understand how exactly he found what he did. He had this to say:</p>
<p>&rt; Yes all of the masks I went out and purchased for the experiment were covered in them. I first looked very carefully just with the eye to see if I could see anything and indeed saw little black fibers on them. Then moved to a 10× magnifying glass to examine them closer. I saw other breathing hot air onto them which made them squirm around so it ried and many of them moved in a very strange way that seemed organic. Then I moved to a lab grade microscope and started other experiments. At first I was a little skeptical and wondered if they were moving solely from the movement of air like any other fiber in the wind so I started using hot water and just body heat and sure enough they reacted to the heat. I will be taking very magnified images and videos of them and will post them. Also their reactions to blood, tissue and various other chemicals. I also found that they were very attracted to metal and would stick to it. What I am most curious to see is how they react to high radio frequencies. I am terrified that they may just start freaking out and moving erratically. I have a friend in micro biology and am trying to get a collaboration going on with him to better understand what they might be.</p>
<p>Of course, it would be unfair to dissect this research without also looking into, well, independent researchers who disagree with any motion of concern:</p>
<p>Why you should NOT be worried about microscopic worms in your face mask(https://youtu.be/erE45Nfa6No)</p>
<p>A couple takes I have from this video:</p>
<p>1) His biggest reason for why you should not be worried seem to stem from the fact that these fibers are all over the place. Further, he stated that you can isolate these fibers yourself if you take a piece of tape to clothes and remove the tape. </p>
<p>My issue with this is: What if these ‘fibers’ found in face masks aren’t at all like the fibers on that of a shirt? Really, from this video, there’s no way of discerning that information. </p>
<p>2) Even if, like he said, they are just ‘loose fibers’ coming from brand new, unopened masks, that is not at all something to be breathing into the lungs, therefore perhaps there should be some slight worry? </p>
<p>Of course, for every video saying, “Worry not, these masks are safe!”, there are about a hundred others, being censored of course, expressing the former. </p>
<p>Here’s a doctor talking about this very issue very recently: https://youtu.be/VHjufoay6Xs</p>
<p>Some interesting takeaways:</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33723507/">Ivermectin</a> has been found to be incredibly effective at treating ‘covid-19’ and the symptoms, but interestingly, <a href="https://www.drugs.com/ivermectin.html">Ivermectin is anti-parasite medication</a></p>
<p>And of course, perhaps to drill the nail in the coffin, all the fact checking opinion articles surrounding the topic:</p>
<p>https://fullfact.org/online/masks-swabs-covid-morgellons-fibres/</p>
<p>https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-afs:Content:9960958416</p>
<p>https://www.oregonlive.com/coronavirus/2021/03/morgellons-disease-fibers-are-covid-19-nasal-swabs-really-planting-things-in-your-brain-totally-false.html</p>
<p>https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-swabs-idUSKBN29P2Q5</p>
<p>This post was made to offer sources surrounding the topic, and I invite you to form your own opinion. Whether these ‘fibers’ are groundbreaking nanotechnology being utilized in a heinous way, or really are just innocent ‘shirt fibers’, two things are for certain:</p>
<p>1) People are finding them in face masks and covid-19 test kits,</p>
<p>2) You should not be breathing them in</p>
<p>Thanks all, stay safe.</p></p>
