    <strong>For anyone who thinks that prevention of disease is what drives" science"...</strong>
    <p><p><strong>I highly recommend checking out the</strong> <strong><em>"Orthotropics"</em></strong> <strong>channel on YouTube, ran by a British orthodontist John Mew and his son Mike Mew, also an orthodonist.</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Orthotropics"><strong>https://www.youtube.com/user/Orthotropics</strong></a></p>
<p>We've been told that crooked teeth is mainly hereditary. So, we're merely born with "too many teeth in the mouth", and extracting upwards of 4-6 teeth and closing the gaps with orthodontic braces and brackets is our solution to that.</p>
<p>Decades ago, John Mew began demonstrating that crooked teeth is largely due to environmental factors. When we look at the skulls of our ancestors who chewed hard foods on a daily basis, they nearly always had all 32 teeth functionally working, and their palates were wide enough to allow their tongues to rest pressing against the roof of the mouth.</p>
<p>This encourages the maxilla to develop and grow up and forward due to constant pressure on the hard palate which stimulates growth in the direction of that pressure. An upwardly-swung maxilla is optimal for nasal breathing. The tongue is able to rest in a position that allows for mouth-closed breathing, freeing the airway from obstruction.</p>
<p>The pressure applied to the alveolar bone when constantly assuming proper tongue posture naturally creates straight teeth, because the alveolar ridge is developed to accommodate the tongue. This concept also is demonstrated through the prevalence of jaw joint problems, sleep apnea, misdiagnosed asthma due to structurally impeded airways, and poor neck posture in people who had teeth orthodontically extracted.</p>
<p>The foods resulting from industrialized society are soft and don't exert the force on the maxilla and mandible that encourages proper bone growth. People are being told their only option for temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD) is invasive surgery, when the problem is them having 24 teeth instead of 32 is drastically affecting their ability to breathe sufficiently. People who suffer obstructive sleep apnea unrelated to being morbidly obese are often found to be mouth breathers due to improper tongue posture. They have no choice but to rest their tongue between their teeth, encouraging the retraction of their alveolar ridges and tongue space, compromising their ability to breathe comfortably and efficiently.</p>
<p>Sounds groundbreaking right? Well get this, John Mew and his son Mike have been <strong>banned</strong> from the British Orthodontics Society, and have been labeled as con-artists peddling pseudoscience, when their work speaks for itself. They are upending the orthodontics and dental industries with their focus of instructing young children to breathe with their mouth closed with the help of  functional appliances and not constricting their palates with orthodontic extraction causing a host of health issues.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/20/magazine/teeth-mewing-incels.html">The New York Times put out an article proclaiming them as "celebrities to incels" due to their emphasis on improving facial form in regards to health.</a></p>
<p>Do we really want to prevent disease, or do we want to promote the development of it and sell shit that manages symptoms and often worsens the underlying cause of disease?</p></p>

        <p>Love this ! All so true!! Corporations want to make as much money as possible off of people by repackaging cheap junk and garbage to feed to children and saying it's nutritious .. This really began at a disastrous level in the 90's when kids were fed extruded grains (cereals) and margarine and skim milk.... all of that increased profits but harmed the population enormously ! Why does no one remember in the 90's when ALL OF THE GOVERNMENT HEALTH AGENCIES PRESSURED EVERYONE TO REPLACE BUTTER WITH TRANS FATS??? Trans Fats are illegal today in NY and California.  Why doesn't anyone talk about this? The other horrible factor with all our increased consumption of Frankenstein oils like canola and hydrogenated soy etc is the increased omega 6 (which could never be found in a natural diet without the use of modern technology) replaces omega 3 in the human brain.  Fully 20% of the human brain is meant to be DHA and EPA, omega 3 fats... What happens when that is replaced with omega 6? Sociopathic aka narcissistic personality disorder due to the destruction of the frontal cortex which is what processes empathy. Maybe remarketing engine oil as healthy oil for humans to cook with was not the best idea after all...</p>
