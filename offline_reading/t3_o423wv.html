    <strong>Bathing in the same pool is ok but keep a safe distance, will you?</strong>
    <p><p>Aight I just want to present the newest edition of this clown circus we call Germany.</p>
<p>I'll skip all the stuff we've already dealt with and get to the fun part.</p>
<p>Outdoor public pools have reopened over here. However one has to book an online ticket and spaces are limited. Some public pools allow you to stay for the entire day while others have time limits and some close down for an hour in between groups for cleaning (whatever that looks like).</p>
<p>Now to my favourite rule tho:</p>
<p>At one location you are demanded to wear a mask right up until you enter the pool. </p>
<p>I'm not talking about the entrance where you present your ticket.</p>
<p>You literally have to wear a mask right up until you enter the water.</p>
<p>It doesn't stop here tho. </p>
<p>The pool supervisors make sure that people do not swim next to each other, not even if they came together. Everyone has to keep a safe distance.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I am absolutely amazed how people just put up with all this nonsense.<br>
However it illustrates how the regimes in Germanys past were able to exist for as long as they did.</p></p>

        <p>I expected peaceful non compliance after 4 months of mask nonsense. Guess a lot of people are very different from me.</p>
<p>After 18 months I don't see it happening either unfortunately.</p>

        <p>What? Like what is so unexpected about this? This seems very in line with other covid guidelines and slowly but steadily returning to normal life. </p>
<p>Lets assume for a second that covid is real and more or less dangerous and that masks and social distancing help slow down the spread of the virus.</p>

        <p>for kids it is, yes. Young adults use public pools more as a meeting place like parks and adults and older people just swim for the sports or the activitys sake.</p>
<p>yes, kids cant play together at the pool like pre covid in germany for excample there are plans for sinking covid case numbers which allow more and more freedoms given back to the people.</p>
<p>With the vaccine and social distancing we have a real chance of defeating covid and we are closer than ever.</p>

        <p>they should! yes but we made this mistake time and time again:</p>
<p>Covid infections dropped and we imediatly opend everything back up only to get hit by the next wave.</p>
<p>We have the vaccine now so we only hold out for a bit longer and need to make sure the vast majority is protected to have a real chance at defeating covid once and for all.</p>

        <p>&rt;Like what is so unexpected about this?</p>
<p>If we are living through one of the deadliest pandemics in the history of ever... how come we can go to public pools in the first place?<br>
How come we can take of the mask once in the water but not outside?<br>
How come we can all swim in the same water but not next to each other?<br>
How come there are "cleaning breaks" between 2 groups but not inbetween the individual people of each group?</p>
<p>If the rules themselves followed a logic I would be almost ok with them but the way we live right now is with a set of rules that contratidct each other.</p>
<p>This proves to me that it is not about health but about obedience.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;This seems very in line with other covid guidelines and slowly but steadily returning to normal life.</p>
<p>Exactly! All the other rules don't follow logic either.</p>
<p>Germany currently has the lowest number of new infections and the government still extended the state of emergency for another 3 months. Seems like a very slow return to normal life.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Lets assume for a second that covid is real and more or less dangerous and that masks and social distancing help slow down the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>Ok let's do that.</p>
<p>Then how come it is ok to go to a public pool but at the same time it is so dangerous that we have to wear a mask?<br>
Either the risk of infection is that high that wearing a mask and keeping as much distance between individuals is necessary or we can enjoy summer and go to the public pool.</p>
<p>You can't have both.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;do you need to cuddle up to other people while swimming?</p>
<p>If you go to the pool with your friend/girlfriend/wife/mother wouldn't you at least want to swim next to them?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Again if the rules themselves followed a clear logic I would at least be able to understand the intention behind them. The way it is right now seems like someone trying to break morale and teaching obedience.</p>

        <p>"If we are living through one of the deadliest pandemics in the history of ever... how come we can go to public pools in the first place?"</p>
<p>This isnt one of the deadliest pandemics? its just a bad pandemic, actually we can count ourselves lucky that we didnt get something like ebola but spreading like covid to expose to vulnerabilietes in our reaction to a pandemic.</p>
<p>If it were for me we wouldnt go to pools but instead ramp up vaccinations to beat cavid asap.</p>
<p>"How come we can all swim in the same water but not next to each other?"</p>
<p>Last time i checked there was chlorine in the water, not in the air... would not be too pleasant if they pumped chlorine gas in the air.</p>
<p>"How come there are "cleaning breaks" between 2 groups but not inbetween the individual people of each group?"</p>
<p>How would you clean between indivdual people if they are in the pool together? If you clean between groups, you can limit the chain of infection to one group to keep track of the virus and only send those in that group in quarantine/ to get tested.</p>
<p>"Either the risk of infection is that high that wearing a mask and keeping as much distance between individuals is necessary or we can enjoy summer and go to the public pool."  </p>
<p>Again, if it were for me, we wouldnt be going to public pools yet. BUT Covid does not have only two extremes from "Its rampant everywhere" to "there is no covid". In germany we are almost at "there is no covid" but not quite there yet. With the increasing amount of vaccinated people we can slowly start to open back up again and opening restaurants and pools etc. with some limitations seems like a reasonable middle ground.</p>
<p>Ofc its sad we cant get the full "going to the pool with friends and family" experience yet but its a start.</p>

        <p>If it was a real pandemic and they had actually wanted to protect people, they would've rolled out the army, THW etc for strict enforcement.      </p>
<p>That's what the Bundeswehr is there for, protection of the country. If total lockdown and strict enforcement had been necessary, it could've been achieved this way.      </p>
<p>They would've called in every damn dumb motherfucker, like me, who didn't decline duty back then and done a hard lockdown. The whole scenario would've been over after 2 - 4 weeks.     </p>
<p>Australia is going into lockdown again because of "new cases". Can you explain me how a country which forces every person to stay in a hotel for 2 weeks upon entry, at their own cost of over 3k btw, can have any cases? Especially the "new variant"?      </p>
<p>Either hypocritic politicians or other entities have broken the rules and there really is an "outbreak" or it's just absolute utter bullshit and that's what it is.      </p>
<p>Without even pulling any papers, just from the contradictions you see in the rules and the daily behaviour of the cunts in power, I can point out why this is the most gigantic hoax in history.</p>

<p>No shit sherlock but if the risk of infection was that high why allow people to swim in the same pool in the first place?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; If you clean between groups, you can limit the chain of infection to one group to keep track of the virus and only send those in that group in quarantine/ to get tested.</p>
<p>The groups are about 200 people. If it really was about stopping infections noone would allow 200 people go to the same public pool.<br>
I don't know about the cleaning process in between groups but if hospitals have allegedly trouble keeping infections down how well can a public pool clean their location?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;In germany we are almost at "there is no covid" but not quite there yet.</p>
<p>So why exactly was the state of emergency prolonged for another 3 months?</p>
<p>Maybe Spahn didn't waste enough money yet.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;opening restaurants and pools etc. with some limitations seems like a reasonable middle ground.</p>
<p>That is if the entire lockdown and rules were logical and adequate.</p>
