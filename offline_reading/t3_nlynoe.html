    <strong>A List of links</strong>
    <p><p>So, my friends and I are split on the vaccine, of course I don’t want to get it, they have. I’m sure many of you guys have friends or loved ones who also are split as you are. I’m creating this thread and will continuously come back to update when I stumble upon more vaccine controversy. So, as stated here are 3 articles linking towards immunity of covid, as well as vaccine concerns. If you also have links/studies/anything to help so that way we are able to educate our friends and loved ones. Knowledge is power, people always say “source” or “ link the article” well with this thread (assuming/hoping it gets big enough). We are able to just send this thread over and they can read for themselves, or if the random internet stranger wants a link to sources. It’s here to help everyone. </p>

        <p>My friends and family are all about 50/50 (vaxed/not vaxed). What I've noticed is, the second anyone tries to persuaded an opinion, the conversation goes nowhere. </p>
<p>We talk about things in the news, but other than that, the topic is very superficial. </p>
<p>We all respect each other's decisions, and that's kind of it. They got vaccinated, there's no changing that. You're (I'm assuming based on this post) not vaccinated, and I'm guessing there's nothing they can tell you to convince you to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>While I'm all for open conversations with my friends, and they are too, this is by far the most polarized topic I've ever encountered. Not worth getting into.</p>

        <p>Definitely agreed with that. I would get the vaccine, if for several reasons. There were multiple studies and trials on it for long term studying. If the virus was far deadlier than what it actually is I would also get it. Being slammed with “get the vaccine now” the whole politics of it also are another reason I’m worried about  getting it. I am by no means anti-vax, I’m just anti big govt/tech/pharma telling me what to do after seeing the studies and mortality rate of the virus itself. You’re right, people are stubborn and in their ways, and it’s not worth the argument, but there are times where someone is able to meet you in the middle and just talk. If their opinion is changed that’s great, if not no big deal. I don’t see an it anything wrong collecting articles/science based reviews and studies to help better spread knowledge, similar to that of a library.</p>
