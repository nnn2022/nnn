    <strong>What if you are scared your spouse will give in?</strong>
    <p><p>We got into a debate, I said we need to do more in life, and start living again and he started saying he was afraid of the "variants".  I told him the "variants" are probably the Vaxxed getting sick and they were manipulation. We believe the virus is "real" but I have talked to him about the manipulation of PCR tests and other discussions here.</p>
<p>I convinced him of the medical dangers of the vaxx but that took a lot of effort. He knows I have studied medical things intently in life to stay alive and that helped, I shared all the doctors and scientists warning, showed animal studies etc. He has huge medical risks, I thought that was enough. He keeps talking about Novavax, being good, but I told him that one will work to bring toxic spike proteins in too, and they all work the SAME in that way, just different delivery.....</p>
<p>But I can see the signs of wavering, and we are under pressure. We have a very liberal church where most got the vaxx and believe the whole narrative. He is upset that I am talking about bible prophecy being true again [he tolerated my past Christian fundamentalism before I deconverted but  he never converted in during that time, and knew that I was into conspiracy]. </p>
<p>I have told him people of other religions see the vaxxes as being evil too and it's not just fundamentalist Christians but I am disturbing him using terms like "mark of the beast".</p>
<p>I got upset and said it would be unacceptable for me. I can handle normal average people getting it, it's their choice but do you think I want spike proteins right in my home with my health problems?  </p>
<p>I love him and do not want him to die, or have heart attacks, strokes, and he has a vein disorder that makes the vaxxes that much more dangerous. </p>
<p>He hasn't made any places to get it, but I can see the wavering. He has a NPC friend that could be working on him, he's watched our very liberal church all vaxxed hanging out together while telling the unvaxxed to wear masks, he's scared for me--disabled wife which I understand and of course for his own health.</p>
<p>I told him I don't want him to become a pod person and be submitted an evil system and I cannot tolerate that. I even cried at one point. He told me to calm down.</p>
<p>I have ignore the topic with him for weeks, I shared a few things I learned here, so it was only occasional, but I feel like everyone is under a spell or something. I can't talk to them. I am having to to "work" so hard to keep him from becoming a Covid zombie I am getting tired. He's reading liberal websites that believe the narrative. I am a liberal/leftist too but a disaffected one. I used to talk about conspiracy stuff for years, and even as leftist I was one on the outside of the "mainstream" and right now trying to figure out how I am failing to deliver the message. I know the religious stuff I am saying is bugging him about spirituality and nature, and Jesus's warnings and true teachings. </p>
<p>We have gotten into debates where I have told him they are going to make this mandatory and he tells me I am crazy for saying that and "it's never going to happen", so any preparations that are to be made are on me, where I have told him we should keep cars gassed up, have some MREs, and camping supplies and more. We had power outages where some of my supplies got us through.</p>
<p>I am a very disabled woman, so this is even scarier. I can't hike off to some woods alone if they start doing the round ups. I started crying thinking they were going to get him into their clutches too. </p>
<p>The vaxx thing scares me. I believe his life would be at immediate risk, I have major health problems but his are serious too. He has no health insurance to deal with any intense stuff either.  He asked me "don't you ever think you are wrong?" I said "Sure, but I know I am not wrong about them lying to us or this vaxx being evil and listed the doctors and scientists like Yeadon, Malone, warning us. I have a Twitter FULL of stuff, under another name, scientific studies etc etc, and have shown it to him. </p>
<p>Yeah I am scared. I am totally ALONE here except for friends online and people online to talk to.  Everyone has lined up. I care about the people at our very liberal church but I am upset there too. I kept thinking just keep head down, let this blow over, don't make enemies of people, be quiet, but this just seems grow worse and worse and like it won't end.</p>
<p>Now I am scared of his wavering.......</p></p>

        <p>You can’t control what your husband does. It’s his decision to get it just as it is your decision to abstain from it. You should be willing to support him regardless because you love him. Sometimes people we love don’t agree with us and do things we don’t like and this may be one of those times.</p>

        <p>I’m going through the same thing with my husband. He said he’s not getting it, but I wouldn’t put it past him to do it and not tell me. I’ve explained to him what is happening to women that have been exposed to the shedding, and he’s seemed concerned. I also think of the flip side, if he didn’t get it and got covid and it took him down, how his family would blame me. In the end, and this is just for me, I decided that with so many people getting it it’s virtually impossible for me to avoid the shedding, and I’ll just have to deal with what comes of it. I’ve educated him the best I can, but it’s his life, and his ultimate decision lies with him, I’ve done my due diligence. I know that living in fear will exacerbate any illnesses I may happen upon, so I put one foot in front of the other each day and wear the full armor of God, and that’s the best I can do. They don’t get my Mind or spirit.</p>
