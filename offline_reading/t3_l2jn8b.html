    <strong>"Low-risk countries" are going to be the last to exit this pandemic.</strong>
    <p><p>I do acknowledge that parts of USA and Europe are extremely far from normal given these draconian lockdowns, but I respect the fact that your government are just aiming to reduce the spread of the virus and not eliminate it. If this is the case, I have the feeling that once everyone that wants to get vaccinated gets vaccinated, you guys will get back to normal pretty fast.        <br>
Unfortunately, Countries that are aiming for elimination, which I'm associated with, really think they can keep this up forever. Singapore, my home country, has said that international travel won't be possible soon even with vaccines. Australia took it a step further and has banned citizens from leaving their country, and has banned it till 2022.         <br>
Singapore is really the furthest thing from normal as well; masks everywhere we go, and no gatherings of more than 8. Although these haven't had too much of an impact on me personally, I can't help but think what the point of eliminating COVID if we're still going to have these restrictions in place, and especially when they've said vaccines aren't going to resolve the issue. I'd even argue most of USA are freer than us.       <br>
COVID is going to live for many decades, and I feel that USA/Europe is at the very least prepared to live with COVID if cases are lower than usual. Low-risk countries have no plan in mind, have developed no natural herd immunity, and we're most likely going to still be locked in while the majority of the world will be going on holidays this summer. They are only satisfied with zero cases, and in order to keep this up, they are going to have quarantine and social distancing indefinitely unless there is a change in attitude which unfortunately very few people have at the moment.</p></p>
