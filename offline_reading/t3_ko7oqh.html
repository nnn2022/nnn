    <strong>Introduction and Activism</strong>
    <p><p>I have been following this sub since its inception (how fitting it was on D-Day of 2020) and I have to thank the mods and all the contributors for helping keep a sliver of sanity in a mad world of dystopian nightmares that would make Orwell turn in his grave.</p>
<p>First, I apologize if this is not an acceptable post for this sub, but I have many things I want to say and many people I would like to meet.</p>
<p>It turns out that I'm quite a social person and that I miss making friends. Unfortunately, like so many others, several of my old friends chose to leave my life usually for differing views on this "New Normal," which I am obviously not fond of at all. Since March, my mental health has taken a toll, as well as my social life. Not only do I wish to make friends and talk with like-minded people, but I also wish to actually <em>do</em> something about making a change.  </p>
<p>1) I would like to start a Discord server. Perhaps I will also consider making accounts on certain social media sites like Parler. Admittedly I do not have much social media. Discord is nice and fairly easy to use. It has voice chat and video features and there would be no way for some Zucc to take down our posts. I would be a moderator, but I would also be asking for help with that from others who may be willing, especially in other time zones.   </p>
<p>2) I would love to meet up with people who are in my area. I will just come out and say it, I live in the Cincinnati, OH area. I go all over the local cities and areas for my work including Loveland, Mason, West Chester, Milford, even down south as much as Batavia and up north as Dayton. Hell, I even go to Columbus. I know two places, one in Dayton, the other in Columbus, that also oppose the new normal and can be great meet-up spots! I know the owners of both of those places.   </p>
<p>Let's make this year an even better one! Let's not be angry mobs, but rather try to live normal lives as normal people. Let's defy this "New <em>Abnormal</em>" by being normal.   </p>
<p>Also, a few things about myself: I'm technically in the millennial age group. I am 25. I work with animals primarily. I'm a dog trainer in...well, training. I have many varied interests from music, history, spirituality, outdoor activities like hiking and biking, various "fandoms" across many TV shows and video games, etc.   </p>
<p>Please don't be afraid to PM me to ask questions, chat, or if you want to meet up!   </p>

        <p>This is definitely the way forward. Friendships and activism. I'm stuck in Asia, so, I'm of no use to this potential group but you're doing the right thing and I wish you luck.</p>

        <p>Thank you so much for your lovely and encouraging comment! I hope all is well across the Pacific. You can still be apart of the discord server if you'd like when I get it up and running. I welcome people from everywhere, all walks of life, all backgrounds. The common theme being against these draconian measures. 
I wish the best for you and your country! Stay strong and fight the good fight</p>
