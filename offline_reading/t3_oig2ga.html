    <strong>Alex Berenson Working For The Other Side?</strong>
    <p><p>It's been a mystery why Alex hasn't been banned by Twitter but he claimed long ago to have an "understanding" with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and will occasionally @jack regarding various issues.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Alex mentioned he might take the vaccine if he has to do international travel, although he outwardly remains admanantly opposed to it and states he's not vaccinated.</p>
<p>I've always wondered if part of his deal with Twitter was to amass a giant following of those who are against things like we are at NNN, and then all of a sudden just say "we're beaten...gotta take the vaccine...it's not that bad." </p>
<p>The infamous controlled opposition who ultimately tells his quarter million followers who don't want the vaccine, that it's "okay" to take it. </p>
<p>Why else is he allowed to do the things he does? Would love to hear your opinions.</p></p>

        <p>Alex is a mystery. He’s blocked Ryan Christian (aka The Last American Vagabond), and several other independent journalists whom I like, and everyone he’s blocked or dissed are those who are against the “New Normal”. He pissed me off when he said some terrible things about Dr Simone Gold. </p>
<p>He doesn’t like conspiracy theorists, or those who he thinks of as crazy, as he said it would ruin his own reputation. I detest him, but he writes things that are helping shine the light on this scamdemic. It’s best to consider him a question mark. My inner gut feeling is that he’s someone I would not trust.</p>

        <p>Appreciate the thoughtful reply. </p>
<p>He's one of my favorites, but I have some questions about his motives.</p>

        <p>I’m glad you brought him up because I don’t see a lot of these types of posts that go in-depth about things of this nature. I feel there are plans within plans, and various groups with different agendas, but these warring groups are riding on each other’s “coat tails” as it were, to satisfy their short term or long term objectives.</p>

        <p>No question. He was lamenting his follower count being reduced not all that long ago. Now, that it got back up over 250k, he decided to launch his paid subscription site, so he makes money off his following. </p>
<p>My guess is he will ultimately relent and tell all his followers they need to be vaccinated, but he has to cultivate a longer term bond with them in order to win them over when he drops the bomb on them.</p>
<p>His agreement with Jack had to go something like this:</p>
<p>Alex: Jack, you okay with me making a little money off this like everyone else as long as I, in the end, push people toward the same message you are?</p>
<p>Jack: Sure, but don't be too brutal on me, or Twitter. </p>
<p>Alex: Okay, keep the warning and misleading labels off my posts.</p>
<p>Jack: Let me know if you have any issues in that regard. Our algorithms are programmed to find things, so some of your tweets might trip them.</p>
<p>---I've noticed Alex tends to @jack whenever he does get a label. You would think Jack would say to just suspend his account, if he didn't have some other motive to convert the "hesitant" by playing the long game.</p>

        <p>I totally agree, you’re spot on with your analysis &amp; you can see beyond what he tweets out. I’ve caught him a few times with saying something along the lines of “these <em>current</em> vaccines aren’t safe, so I’ll only trust &amp; take covid vaccines when new verified &amp; authenticated ones come out” (I’m paraphrasing from what I recall what he tweeted a few weeks ago). That’s what really got me concerned about what his true motives are. We should keep an eye on him. He’s sneaky.</p>

        <p>I think he’s on the level but he does stuff like that to not get banned off twitter.  He’s tightrope walking if you know what i mean.  He denounces some more polarizing elements to maintain his image as a “sane” critic of what’s going on.</p>
<p>Can’t say i like it but he seems to be on the right side</p>
<p>If he starts shilling for the vax cut him off</p>

        <p>Dude everyone trying to sway your opinion is working for the other side, at this point. They're either controlled opposition or just controlled. That goes for Alex, Russell Brand, and probably High Impact Flix, even though I do get a lot of inspiration from the latter two. Just gotta be wary; if they're allowed a platform, that platform is geared to deceive you in one way or another. But as long as you recognize that, it's fairly easy to separate the chaff from the wheat.</p>

        <p>His account may also be acting as a repository of anti-vaccine cititzens which will ultimately be spun into anti-government sentiment that will soon be criminalized.</p>
