    <strong>Six Possible End Game Purposes of These Injections</strong>
    <p><p>Firstly, I dont think a "vaccine" is necessary for such a weak disease as covid. In the past, we have had viruses come and go, but never have we seen such an aggressive push by world governments to get an injection into the citizens. Why? I'm not sure, but I have 6 options as to why the government's of the entire world are so adamantly insisting we all get this pharmaceutical injected in our bodies. </p>
<p>1) Profit. Pharmaceutical companies owned (via shares) by those directly in control of mandating their products into civilians, and negotiation of taxpayer dollars used to purchase the product. Subsequent variations produced to combat the varient of the day, all available to the public via tax dollars, or at some point privately in a subscription based model.</p>
<p>2) Depopulation. If the spike protein can cross the blood brain barrier, there is a decent chance that it can cause malformed proteins to fold incorrectly, causing prion disease. Neuro degenerative disease pops up in a few years with massive amount of people suffering from some type of prion related illness, culling the population down significantly. I would give the odds of this particular option being correct a higher score if they keep the injections out of children, because they will still need a generation of worker slaves to run the day to day. </p>
<p>3) Priming. This is just the first stage in a series of increasingly invasive medical procedures, and it is introduced as "safety" to warm up the public for mandated medical procedures. </p>
<p>4) Tracking. In conjunction with maditory "passports", the vaccine status of people will be applied to a form of ID that initially only keeps track of your vax status. Overtime, this same ID will be tied to your bank account, taxation status, political affliation, and whatever other variable they want to track. This way, they can shut out anyone from society they deem unacceptable. </p>
<p>5) They know something we don't know. They know of some kind of future event that will take place and in order for it to be successful, we have to be modified in a particular way. You can take this option to extreme-outside-the-box thinking into alien invasions, mark of the beast type conclusions. </p>
<p>6) Sterilization/Fertility. It contains something that makes having children more difficult in the future. Perhaps not immediately.</p></p>

        <p>I don't care what political party you subscribe to, the leaders of both American, all Canadian, all UK, all Australian, Chinese, and Russians have all said to take the vaccine. All of them. </p>
<p>Whenever I see everyone pushing for the same agenda, I get suspicious. </p>
<p>Perhaps I'm completely wrong and these pharmaceutical companies produced a miracle and are acting benevolently towards the human race, but that seems harder to believe than any of the reasons above.</p>

        <p>Government, the media, and big pharma are all well documented liars...now we have all 3 of these groups teamed up together and pushing the vaccine with a propaganda campaign the likes of which has never been seen. I don't know why they are pushing the vaccine to this extent but I don't see how it could be anything good.</p>

        <p>Thats a good point. A massive fuck up. And they want to get rid of stock quickly before it is uncovered further. </p>
<p>However, that explains the pharmaceutical companies wanting to get paid, but it doesn't fully explain why governments would go along with it to the extent of mandating it.</p>

<p>I also think tickling your brain with a swab is totally unnecessary as a testing protocol. If they use wastewater as their benchmark for varient concentrations in the public, I'm sure saliva would suffice to test for the virus.</p>

        <p>EO is Ethylene Oxide, which is often used to sterilize medical products and surgical instruments. The difference is, that surgical instruments or mentioned medical products normally don't remain within our bodies, but the nano fibres, these 'cotton' Covid test swabs are made of, tend to remain in your mucuos membrane. If you have to endure these stupid Covid swabs make sure you find a test provider or kit, that has plastic swabs. My employer once wanted me to do one of these stupid tests after I returned from Costa Rica, so I chose the most expensive serious testing lab, which only does throat swabs (not the deep nasal swabs), uses plastic swab kits and only hires medical staff.</p>

        <p>Hmmm I haven’t heard of this conspiracy yet. Do these swabs definitely have EO in them? Won’t be getting another test for sure! I had to get one in April and then got pregnant in June (so maybe not complete infertility then??).</p>
<p>Interesting then how some colleges, for example, are mandating a weekly test of unvaccinated students. This could be their plan… infertility one way (vaccine) or another (EO)?</p>

        <p>Yes, they wouldn’t even give my autistic 5-year-old an exemption for the testing even though the test causes her to have an extremely panicked meltdown. I had to pull her out of school because they wouldn’t let her back in-person without the testing. It’s downright evil what they’re doing!</p>

        <p>That is an AWESOME idea- if what I’m seeing online is any indication, there is (and will continue to be) a huge demand for that kind of schooling. Parents have PTSD from last year and we can’t trust the school system anymore, not even private ones. I actually think that might be the future of teaching, because our system right now is practically defunct.</p>

        <p>I was talking with a coworker about this, and he agrees there's something up with this. He countered my sterilization theory with: diet and exercise can change a woman's menstrual cycle. While he's not wrong, those are extreme cases. Women that starve themselves or exercise to the point of extremely low body fat tend to stop menstruating. But just jogging a couple of times a week, or eating "clean" aren't enough to mess up their cycles.  </p>

        <p>Well, you have to think about the coercion of this whole thing, too.  If it was about profits, I doubt we would be hammered, day in and out, from every direction with this thing.  I was thinking about that.  Obviously, thy are connected well enough to pull this off, why not just add them to the tons of bailouts we had under "research" or something?</p>
<p>The amount of effort to manipulate people into this and change life, in my mind, is more than just about profits.  Imagine if McDonalds were so well connected.  Would they go to such am extent if Big maccys came out with a new Chicken sandwich?  No, there is a difference in this and there isnt enough money to go around, on this deal, to justify everyone who is in on this to make this happen.</p>

        <p>I love your post. I think there's a good chance it's a combination of a lot of these. I would add to it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Distraction/Division/Diversion from a financial event while creating an infrastructure for stability when the big event happens. We are in the bubble of all bubbles, and it will burst at some point. This could lead to massive protests. The lockdown infrastructure will allow governments world wide to shut down protests due to "viruses." In the meanwhile, the people are divided &amp; distracted, not noticing all the financial indicators warning of what's coming.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, if you read Henry Kissinger's "Security Memorandum Study 200" declassified in 1989, you'll see they value small percentages. Even if only a small percentage of people are made infertile, or die prematurely to cancer or alzheimers-like prion disease, etc. That is still a win from them.</p>
<p>For example, he said the role of abortion in global population reduction must be appreciated, and talked about how funding can be provided to countries indirectly to encourage it.</p>
<p>He also talked about putting money into discovering new sterility injections, and that the global population problem may be serious enough that we need to consider doing things that would have one been thought morally reprehensible.</p>
<p>So my point is, our own government documents publicly talk about things that aren't far off from what you're suggesting.</p>
<p>How about this one, also on our own government's website:</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Compulsory moral bioenhancement should be covert</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Some theorists argue that moral bioenhancement ought to be compulsory. I take this argument one step further, arguing that if moral bioenhancement ought to be compulsory, then its administration ought to be covert rather than overt. This is to say that it is morally preferable for compulsory moral bioenhancement to be administered without the recipients knowing that they are receiving the enhancement.</p>

        <p>"If preventing ultimate harm requires lying, even by omission, then lie we must. Even if the dishonesty is not necessary and it is unambiguously wrong to be so dishonest, the wrongness of the dishonesty does not outweigh the utility of preventing ultimate harm.</p>
<p>To argue that it is not necessary to be dishonest about the moral bioenhancement is nothing more than the claim that a covert moral bioenhancement is not necessary for the prevention of ultimate harm. </p>
<p>However, I am not claiming that a covert moral bioenhancement program is necessary. I am arguing that it is preferable to an overt program. To measure this preference, I have appealed to frameworks of public health ethics. And it seems according to these 
frameworks that a covert program is preferable.</p>
<p>One may also think that there is disutility in dishonesty. 
Thus, when we do our balancing of values, we must include this disutility that comes along with a covert moral bioenhancement program. </p>
<p>The alleged disutility of the dishonesty would have to outweigh the risk of ultimate harm. It seems obvious to me that it doesn’t, that it is more akin to a little white lie when compared to the potential risk of being honest. But others may think that it’s worth the greater risk to the existence of humanity to be honest."</p>
