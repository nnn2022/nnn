    <strong>My income is short lived</strong>
    <p><p>Today I received the news that I will not be employed for much longer unless I get the jab. I presented the forms from the WDA website with 13 questions to ensure my family would be taken care of financially in the event of harm or death from the jab since there is no liability without it. They would not sign it. This cult of personality possesses the minds of these people. I was told they HAVE to fire those of us who won't get the jab because their life insurance provided will not cover anyone in the company unless we are all jabbed. As tempting as it is to just conform, it will never happen. I will not go down on the wrong side of history. Forgive me if that comes off self righteous. </p>
<p>To anyone who will not bend to this insanity in the name of liberty.  You are a God sent soilder. Amor Fati "love of fate" my freinds.  I truly love you and everything you stand for. Do not let them break you, do not let them crush your will, and never for 1 second lose hope. Failure is not a option. There are worst things than death, never forget that. Godspeed my beautiful people.</p></p>
