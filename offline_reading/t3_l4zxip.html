        <p>I came looking for a post like this. New Zealand has just finished finding a “new strain” from someone who completed their 2 weeks of hotel quarantine, only to test positive upon LEAVING the hotel. The new strain is, yet again, more dangerous than the last and “one to watch out for.” </p>
<p>Australia seems to always have at least one state that alternates between lockdowns and being released from them. And every so often they throw in a “new strain” as though to justify ‘this is what were protecting you from.’ Yet it still continues to happen, another strain. </p>
<p>On top of that, the media continuously said “nothing will get better till we get a vaccine” or “nothing will go back to normal until a vaccine is available.” Now its “okay theres a vaccine that everyone must take... twice. But no nothing will go back to normal, youll still need to quarantine and social distance from one another. Oh and make sure you dont take those masks off.”</p>
