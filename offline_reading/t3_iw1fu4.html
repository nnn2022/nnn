        <p>Gotta love cities of Atwater and also Coalinga in California that have refused to comply with overbearing lockdown orders of the California governor.  Atwater even issued this proclamation for our Constitutional rights and promising safe haven for businesses.</p>

        <p>Cases are down in all of Merced county but did not find any special info for Atwater.  Really the two locations that have refused to lockdown have not been in the news at all, I only heard about them via a comment in a youtube livestream.  I found the Atwater manifesto by going to their city home page just for the same reason you are asking about, to see how they were doing.  The main piece of new news for them seems to be that they sent a letter to congress complaining about the governor but that's all I could find.  I can only guess they are doing fine since the news is not talking about them.  Really California has been in decent shape this whole time hospitalwise, right now the governor is only looking at cases and ignoring hospitals (because hospitals are fine).</p>

        <p>If they had an even slightly more than average amount of cases, you can bet the media would have been all over them.</p>

        <p>Yep, that's what I was thinking, locally even when we have an uptake in percentage for a few days in a row, the news says something like 'cases surging, hospital numbers rising, if this keeps up we'll be over run by xyz day!'  But I've been watching the charts for month now and the hospital rates bounce slightly up and down by a few percentage points, it's hardly cause for alarm if they bounce up a few percent after seeing they do that about 10 times per month and then bounce right back down again and its only a small mount.  It's just that other peeps are not watching the charts, which are kinda hard to find and the news of course never shows it.  And the news only covers it when it goes up, but does no mention when it goes back down, leaving most listeners to assume the numbers are still up even when they are not.  So sad, many have refused to go to the hospital for other probs because the news made them think the hospitals are packed with contagious covid patients but really our local hospitals are a ghost town.  I can't believe I live in a time when I have to be my own news programmer and hunt for truth on youtube of all places because the 'news' on tv refuses to show it.  :-(</p>

        <p>We went and spent a whole lot of money there shortly after they issued this.  (There's some neat stuff there, if you like planes and indoor ranges.)    Should probably go again soon.</p>

        <p>Only 450 miles from me, I should probably try to stop in for lunch one of these days too, they deserve it!  ;-P  I am just praying to all that is holy that some of my local republican towns grow some cajones soon and step up to the plate as well.  Come on republicans, get off your butt and take action!  (Help me Obiwan Kenobi, you're my only hope!!)</p>
