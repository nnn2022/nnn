    <strong>It happened…</strong>
    <p><p>Well last week was the end of my first 3 month period at my first job at a company out of college. After the first 3 months I was supposed to be converted into a salary employee with full benefits, a 401k, and a raise. </p>
<p>I’m not vaxed and the past couple months my managers were kind of pestering me to get it but I told them I would like to wait at this time. So fast forward to this past week, I was talking to my supervisor and he shadily asked me if I was planning on getting the shot anytime soon, again I answered that I wasn’t planning to at this time. Then a couple days later at the end of my shift my supervisor and head HR lady came to my cubicle and handed me my termination letter.</p>
<p>I was shocked, things were going great and I was really jiving with the company. I tried to talk and ask why they came to this decision, the HR lady wouldn’t let my supervisor tell me anything and then signaled for him to go away while she finished up. And that was it, I was ushered out of the building.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to think it was because of not having the shot, but everything about the situation leads me to believe that it was. They had indicated that I was the only one in our office without it and that I was a risk. I’m just mad I was so naive that I had no idea it was coming so now I’m out of a job with no leads to another. This shit is so dumb.</p></p>

        <p>Unfortunately yes. During your trial or probationary period your often at the mercy of almost instant termination with very little recourse. As far as I am aware this goes for most countries.</p>

        <p>Hindsight is 20/20, but I think your only move out of this would have been to schedule an appointment for the gene therapy weeks out, show them your appointment, and this would have bought you time out of the 3 month preliminary period.</p>
<p>Then, of course, don't show up for your appointment.</p>
<p>You did the right thing, even though there may have better options if anticipated. As difficult as things are now, you stood up for your beliefs and principles and didn't waver. You'll get further in life being true to your beliefs and principles, even though that road may be rocky and take unexpected turns.</p>

        <p>Your physical integrity is worth more than a job. The situation will change, you might have to accept the short-term losses until things go back to a more reasonable mindset.
Also in this case you should ask for:
1. Liability from the company if anything happens to you after getting the injection (aka insurance), especially long-term payments if you are disabled. This should make them think twice if they have to engage themselves financially. Still don’t accept if they insure you.
2. A specific, written order stating that it would result in termination of your contract for failure to comply. This is to sue them later on, when the injection is finally recognized for what it is: a dangerous experiment</p>

        <p>As shocked as you are now, same they will be when they will see their employees who took the wax came at work with shake or half paralyzed - or not show up anymore. I'm not happy about this, but what can we do?</p>
<p>They rejected everything that wasn't related to official narrative. The companies have ignored them also and gone with the official "guidance". So they will figure it out when these things happen in the office exactly like in those videos that are labeled as "misinformation". Then they will figure it out. See France and Greek.</p>
<p>It would get ugly for some of the vaxed, but the uvaxed far outnumber the vaxed. And when the shit hits the fan for some of the vaxed unfortunately, then there would be no vax mandates.</p>

        <p>Yeah this is also a possibility I’ve considered. Though it is a position where you had to have knowledge of their MANY, specific proprietary systems, which required a good amount of training. Definitely seemed like they were training me for long term and then suddenly this happened.</p>
