    <strong>Let me say something with absolutely no bias. No fighting for a side. No persuasion or anything. Just listen.</strong>
    <p><p>Let me make one thing clear.</p>
<p>Both sides are completely different, but both sides act the same. Both sides believe each other are lunatics. Both sides make fun of each other. Both sides think the other lives in fear. One supposedly fears a virus, the other supposedly fears a mask. Both cannot be in unison. You can't support both sides. Sadly, like a lot of heavily debated things, it's one of those things where there is no inbetween.</p>
<p>I have seen some theories. I've tried to see things your way. Some of what you say makes sense, while some seems like logic was thrown out the window. You must feel the same way about us. Again, both sides cannot understand each other.</p>
<p>But I propose that instead of sticking to one belief, we be open minded. <strong>Both</strong> sides, us too. Sticking to one belief can often be unhealthy, as you could lose sight of what's important to protect your opinion. History has shown this concept thousands of times.</p>
<p>I understand how attached you are to your opinion. I'm sad to say that I will get comments thrashing this post, some not even reading the whole thing first. What I want everyone to do is judge their options more open mindedly.</p>
<p>In any debate, for fun or for glory, the best thing to do is try to understand both sides. You can't prove something by taking information from one source and ignoring everything else. Ignoring the other belief means that you are too protective and will do anything to preserve it, including being in a state of denial. Reminder: Both sides can become like this. A fact is something concrete and unarguable. Both sides can't claim a fact to be true or false depending on the belief. The only way for one person to check is to look at both sides and (fairly) judge using ethos, logos, and pathos (ethicality, logic, and empathy)</p>
<p>If you can actually read through multiple sources with multiple viewpoints and come up with your own view, then you've proven to be responsible. You can understand and respect both sides, but personally choose one.</p>
<p>If you downvote this comment in the sole intent that you disagree with my proposition, you've proven<br>
my point that you can't be responsible with your understanding. I've been gentle. I've been fair. I've seen what you have to say and I made my own decision based on evidence from both sides. I did not try to bash anyone or target or accuse any belief. It's okay if you disagree (within a certain limit) All I ask is that you do the same. That you be as fair.</p></p>

        <p>The problem is, one side wants to do things to <em>everybody</em> while the other side isn't stopping anyone from doing what they want to themselves. </p>
<p>We're against <em>forced</em> or <em>coerced</em> anything against our will while the other side is for forcing things against a person's will. </p>
<p>See the difference? </p>
<p>The details and facts can be debated but that's the bottom line.</p>
<p>It may have started out about a virus, but make no mistake it's political as hell now.</p>

        <p>I completely agree. It has become way too political, but just because somethings shoved in your face or you ignore one side completely doesn't mean you can't do anything about it. I trust people on both sides are responsible enough to know what can be used as evidence and that they aren't completely biased.</p>

        <p>Part of the issue is that a lot of the big tech companies are completely silencing other viewpoints. </p>
<p>If I had stated the Johnson and Johnson vaccine causes blood clots just one day prior to them pausing the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, I likely would have been deplatformed. That is asinine. Many of the doctors who lost their positions last year were spot on with their assessment, it just wasn’t acceptable to say so yet. </p>
<p>There isn’t a place where a good discussion can be had because anything against the narrative gets silenced immediately. I’m all for hearing people’s views and assessments on the situation, even if they’re crazy. Let the ideas come out and let us judge them for ourselves. The fact that big tech is scared to do so means something.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure what you're asking here.   I am fair.  I review many sources of data, including CDC and my own states Dept of Health.  </p>
<p>I just come to different conclusions than you do.  </p>
<p>"A fact is something concrete and unarguable."   Not really.   Science is never 'decided' or 'set'.  It is an ever changing field of asking questions and trying experiments.   </p>
<p>"I understand how attached you are to your opinion."   This sounds rather biased and presumptive.  You are assuming that my opinion has always been set and never changes.  You are incorrect.  Are you not attached to your own opinion?</p>
<p>There are not 'sides' as far as the particulars go.   People have varying opinions about many aspects of the 'Covid' show.  Some like masks but don't want the mRNA shots.  Some don't want either, some want both.   </p>
<p>There are no 'facts' in this debate.  Only differing judgements of the existing evidence.   </p>
<p>One point of this sub is simply that we should all have choice.  The freedom to decide for ourselves what is right for us.  That is the primary difference in belief.    That is what people are trying to take away.   The masks, lockdowns and injections are just the beginning of this loss of choice.   That is what I oppose.</p>

        <p>&rt;"A fact is something concrete and unarguable."</p>
<p>It still can be changed, but it is only concrete if you use all of the information currently available. It was once a fact that the sun was a gas, but it was later proved to be a plasma. But while the only information available could only prove it to be a gas, it was a fact.</p>
<p>&rt;"I understand how attached you are to your opinion."</p>
<p>Both sides are attached. I'm not being biased at all. In fact, you're assuming what I believe. And while I do have my own opinion, and am attached to it, I could only safely say I was attached to it after being 100% sure. And I could only be %100 sure if I reviewed all information carefully to make sure I truly understood.</p>
<p>I kinda hate to say it, but I really don't think there's a gray area. I have never seen someone wear a mask and understand what it does while not wanting to wear it and understanding why they shouldn't.</p>
<p>I am a little interested in your point of losing the loss of choice, but everyone is taking the information available currently to do what's best for everyone. In a situation like this, both sides can't be right to create a balance.</p>
<p>If you imagine (For the sake of neutrality, imagine both worlds as possible but not proven) A world where the virus is real and masks being the option and a world where the virus is fake and the government is lying. The people in the first world will only perpetuate the virus, and the people in the second world will give into the government. Both opposing sides in both worlds will end up in doomsday. It is our responsibility as people to not only do what we think is best, but also be impartial to make sure what we think is really the best.</p>

        <p>It is impossible to not be biased at all.   Everyone has their own filters they see the world through.   No one can be impartial.   </p>
<p>Human beings are all pretty much reward-based creatures.   With rare exceptions, we do what we believe is best for us.</p>
<p>The pro-new-normal folks believe their self interest is best served by oppressing everyone to one common set of behaviors.   They believe government will reward them.   </p>
<p>Viruses are probably 'real', though I doubt we fully understand their function.   The effectiveness of masks in stopping viral spread is negligble at best, and not worth the costs involved in forcing society to don them.  </p>
<p>Governments always lie.   Always have, always will.   Remember, a government is made up of people acting in their own personal best interest just like you and me.  And ol' Fauci is doing pretty well for himself now.</p>

        <p>I hear you friend. However, I don’t wear a mask because I’m afraid of the mask. I cannot wear one because it goes against my conscience, as I know it is not doing anything useful in filtering viruses. Therefore I refuse to play along with all the madness that is still going on to this day. I would be lying to myself if I did.</p>
<p>Further as someone mentioned above, it is now a highly politicised situation - one that is a hallmark of creeping totalitarianism. And don’t get me started on the injection. You see?</p>

        <p>I do. But one of the problems is that you are making judgements based on your conscience. It is not healthy for anyone to act on what they feel instead of what they know. I was a little skeptical of the masks at first, but instead of saying that it went against what I believed, I did research on both sides to see if what I believed would actually be valid. It would be a better idea to do research on both ideas (while being unbiased and impartial) Don't take what I'm saying as me bashing what you think, but rather suggesting a better way to prove your belief. I respect your opinion.</p>

        <p>No the conversation is over. The only reason science people want to have a conversation now is because you know we are about to back up our words with actions. You realized the tide is turning and like a slimeball you are trying to save what little reputation you have left.</p>

        <p>See, this is the entire thing I’m saying. Everyone is more focused on who I am rather than what I’m saying. I know with certainty that once you know what side I’m on you’ll completely throw away everything I’ve said because “He doesn’t think they way I do so he doesn’t deserve to say anything.” You’re proving this yourself. Notice how I haven’t said anything that relates to my side. Not once have I said do your research, wake up, or anything to persuade you. I trust that anyone is responsible enough to make judgements with proposals from all arguments. That you can believe what you want. In fact, I’ve seen people who fit the beliefs of this subreddit but don’t instantly become hostile if someone disagrees. I really had hope. Again, I did not expect anyone to change their opinion, nor did I want anyone to change. This was not an attempt to change anyone’s minds. This isn’t even about this one controversial topic, it’s about anyone who acts like this when seeing someone with a different idea. I will stop responding to comments, but remember this. Don’t change what you stand for. Change how you stand for it.</p>

        <p>Thank you for being open to discussion, I agree with everything you said, both sides believe they are doing it for the greater good.</p>
<p>The issues I have are:</p>
<p>Why force everyone to be vaccinated and not just the vulnerable?
The statistics and science have shown that over 99% of the population survive Covid-19 perfectly fine.
Why? Because their own immune systems naturally produce the antibodies requires to kill the virus.</p>
<p>So for the vast majority of the world a vaccine is unnecessary...
Why can't we just vaccinate the tiny vulnerable population and let everyone else carry on as normal? This way everyone will be producing the required antibodies for protection.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the vaccines were safe and effective, then why do the vaccinated population receive no benefits from taking the injection?
They currently still have to wear masks and social distance etc etc they can do nothing differently from the unvaccinated... surely if they worked this would not be the case.</p>
<p>In light of all this - does the whole thing not seem incredibly suspicious?</p>
<p>Now the absolute worst part of the entire thing so far...</p>
<p>Vaccine Passports: - Why?!?!?! </p>
<p>As has already been established in my earlier point, there is no need for the majority of the population to get the vaccine... as we will produce antibodies naturally...
So why would they force us to be injected with a substance if we want to take part in normal society?</p>
<p>Is that not the epitome of Tyranny?
&rt; get injected with this substance or you cannot go here or do that?
&rt; today it is Covid-19 but tomorrow something different, whatever they want
&rt; we will have no freedoms, not even over our own bodies?</p>

        <p>This post is absurd. The "two sides" are <strong>fundamentally different</strong>.</p>
<p>One side refers to the other's suffering as "minor inconvenience."</p>
<p>One side is shutting down &amp; bankrupting businesses that don't want to close.</p>
<p>One side is preventing customers of those businesses from accessing their services.</p>
<p>One side is taping up playgrounds and using police to keep children who badly need exercise out of those playgrounds.</p>
<p>One side is filling skateparks with sand.</p>
<p>One side is forcing the other to wear masks.</p>
<p>One side is censoring the other, on social media.</p>
<p>One side is setting rules about who is allowed to meet with whom, and how far we are allowed to travel from our homes.</p>
<p>One side is censoring medical doctors who disagree.</p>
<p>One side is censoring scientists who disagree.</p>
<p>One side is using coercion and attempting to force the other to take a "vaccine."</p>
<p>One side is using police force to trample the other with horses and blast them with water cannons, mace, tame, and beat them with nightsticks.</p>
<p>Simply put, one side is <strong>attacking</strong> and the other side is <strong>defending</strong>. And you equate this?!</p>
<p><em>Your conflation of the two as though there is any kind of overlap clearly shows what side you're on.</em></p>
<p>It's funny - these people have a Reddit full of subs that will auto-ban us for participating here. They have Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram and Youtube and Spotify --- all places that are actively censoring dissent.</p>
<p>But that's not enough. They come here, too, to criticize us for <strong>our reactions</strong> to <strong>their attacks</strong>.</p>
<p>Oh, but I guess I "proved his point" --- By disagreeing with what they are doing to us we're just like them?</p>
<p><strong><em>No one here has ever forced anything on anyone.</em></strong> We have nothing but an opinion that we don't want your psychosis and germaphobia to turn us into criminals for merely existing in the world without a mask. We don't want the rules and restrictions you are putting onto us.</p>
<p>But this guy equates <strong>our opinions</strong> with <strong>their force.</strong></p>
<p><em>Incredible.</em></p>
