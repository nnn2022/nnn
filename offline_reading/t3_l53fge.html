    <strong>not an anti-masker but I really like this sub</strong>
    <p><p>how can I put this, if i'm in a small group of friends who I know aren't sick and haven't been recklessly going about town I'm perfectly fine with not wearing a mask.</p>
<p>when I'm in a walmart with a ton a strangers, thats a different story. Do I think its the end of the world if someone forgets theirs or wear it under their nose? Absolutely not.</p>
<p>But I also don't see the harm in wearing a mask for 10 minutes while shopping for deodorant or whatever. Thats probably my one gripe about some anti-maskers, the ones making scenes in retail stores or the DMV, they aren't helping anything. Also it seems like its usually people who don't have or think they don't have anything to lose. No family who is at risk who they might spread the Vid too, no consequences. That I don't like.</p>
<p>either way I can't stand the white knights of mask wearing. people who sit on the sidelines kooked up in their apartments and never getting out while looking down on everyone they see not wearing a mask(in pictures, on their phones, because they're terrified of going outside mind you). Those people have been so annoying this entire time.</p>
<p>This whole thing is way over blown, the rules are way to strict and it's clear that only businesses with a heavy Washington DC influence were allowed to thrive. I think the  gov and medical field killed more people than actual covid symptoms and a lot of it had to do with trying to blame trump for not curing the pandemic apparently.</p>
<p>anyways, thats all. keep the memes coming lol</p></p>
