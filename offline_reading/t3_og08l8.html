    <strong>Fatality Rate Question</strong>
    <p><p>For those who are smarter-er than I. Let's pretend there is a global virus (not covid) and the fatality rate for a certain age group is 1% (99% chance of survival).</p>
<p>Does that mean...</p>
<p>A) Out of 99 people who get this virus 1 person will die</p>
<p>OR </p>
<p>B) Out of each individual case, there is 1% chance of death?</p>
<p>Thanks</p></p>

        <p>It means B. A is wrong.</p>
<p>Out of 100 people who get it, 1 will die. Equivalently, every individual infected has a 1% change of dying.</p>

        <p>It‚Äôs not as simple as ‚Äú1 out of every 100 will die.‚Äù</p>
<p>There is a 1% chance. The odds of that are so low that it basically rounds down to 0.</p>
<p>So there‚Äôs a 99% chance that you don‚Äôt die. 99 overrides the 1 percent and with the low probability, you aren‚Äôt actually getting 1 death per 100, as each individual has a 99% rate of survival. </p>
<p>https://www.calculator.net/probability-calculator.html?cal1pa=0.99&amp;cal1pb=0.01&amp;calctype=twoe&amp;x=127&amp;y=32</p>
<p>Put .99 and .01 as the values‚Ä¶ the probability of dying happening without intersecting outcomes (one can not both live and die) is .0001, making it more like one out of a thousand.</p>
<p>The way things work out mathematically aren‚Äôt guaranteed, and naturally, a 99% survival rate ensures that pretty much all people infected will recover.</p>

        <p>I am wondering . .  if one of the symptoms/lasting side effects of this virus was enhanced vision in the dark, but only 1% of those who get the virus end up with this side effect, would people be excited about their odds or discouraged?</p>

        <p>There are two metrics: Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and Infection Fatality Rate (IFR). Unfortunately, the medical experts confused these two metrics early in the pandemic, and that contributed to the undue panic. CFR refers to how many have died with a certain amount of detected <em>cases</em> and is usually an exact number. IFR is more of an estimation and refers to how many died with a certain amount of <em>infections.</em> Since cases only include those people that get tested, and many infections go unnoticed, the IFR is usually much lower and gives a more realistic assessment of the lethality of a virus.  </p>
<p>In the early days, experts said that the CFR was around 3%, which was technically correct. But governments and the media misinterpreted this to mean that for every 100 people who get the virus, three would die. Seroprevalence studies conducted later in the pandemic (which search for antibodies) gave a much lower and more realistic IFR. The latest estimate from a meta analysis by John Ioannidis, one of the world's top epidemiologists, estimated the global overall IFR to be about 0.15% (about the same as the seasonal flu), with an estimated 1.5 to 2 billion global infections by February 2021 (much higher than total reported cases). </p>
<p>The true IFR could still be lower, due to the studies not including people who got exposed to the virus but no longer had detectable antibodies, children who are at negligible risk to the disease, and using inflated death counts. That would mean that for the general population, a person who gets the virus would have less than a 1 in 1,000 chance of dying from it. And for the non-elderly population, the chances could be closer to 1 in 10,000, or even lower. For children, the least vulnerable group, it may only be about 1 in half a million or so.</p>
