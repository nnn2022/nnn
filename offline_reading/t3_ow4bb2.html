        <p>That's the thing. I am about 99% sure I never commented on that sub. OFW.. I really could care less. It just proves (even more) about their "tolerance" and hypocrisy. It is amazing how close minded ppl are though.</p>

        <p>I got the exact same from a sub ive never been to today and you couldnt ever pay me any amount to sub to.  </p>
<p>These people arent well - not only do they not realize they shouldnt be stalking and harassing people like this but they genuinely think they have some sort of leverage doing so. </p>
<p>"Hey, youve never used our sub but i stalked you and banned you from it and if you denounce 1/2 subs you ever participate in, we'll let you in our highly censored propagandist sub run by crazy stalkers that youve never expressed any interest in whatsoever."  </p>
<p>So sad.  They truly arent well. This is what censorship bubbles reduce people to - utter nonsense.  I wonder when they'll realize whatever theyre apart of, no matter what it is, sane people want nothing to do with.  They only thing they have to offer is their absence from one's life.  It's unfortunate you cant just block the whole sub but you can block mods of these subs to prevent further stalking and harassment.</p>
