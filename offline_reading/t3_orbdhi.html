        <p>Ok, so I guess I'll explain it to you like you are a five year old, and try not to get offended. We are going to avoid big words. Mkey. When a healthy person breathe into the mask, day after day, you exhale bad stuff and it gets stuck in your mask so you breath it in again. See, that bad stuff you exhaled into your mask was waste which is not good for you and which your body decided to get rid of. It's even more harmful for you when you breathe it in again. Do you follow me? Ok. So you can imagine that mask you have on your face gets full of bad stuff, in and out. Ok. Still here? Ok. So, when you walk around with that mask on your face all of bad stuff that floats in polluted air sticks to the mask and eventually you breathe it in. So now you harm your body in more than one way. When you ride a bike or jog, your lungs are more open for bad stuf and also more bad stuff get on the mask. So, its not only that it doesn't help, but it also hurts you a lot. One more thing if you have a second. That viruses and stuff we now call viruses are so tiny small that when they get close to your mask they fly through it like a mosquito through a huge open window. Snd please watch this also: https://youtu.be/n78GlmPpOD8</p>

        <p>ok. thanks.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>just so you know the viral suspensions are larger than the pores of a proper n95 for proper use against particulate pollution.</p>
<p>You're supposed to change the mask after periods of time, which is a known fact.</p>
<p>Shitty non n95 masks don't even do that but basically prevent your sneeze/cough from spreading viral particulates , and ought to be changed every day.</p>
<p>explain it to me like i'm an f'ing PhD in molecular biology. Go follow your youtube shills happily. Faucci isn't god. He's a dumb human too.</p>

        <p>You're welcome. If there is anything else you need help with just let me know. 
In the future do not act like a moron and people won't treat you like one. 
If you are talking about changing ten cents mask every day, then you are still acting like an idiot. 
You want mee to explain something to you like you sre what? PhD in molecular biology? Really? That's how dense you are? Coming here asking questions that five year old wouldn't ask and then want me to treat you like reasonable person? Nah... We were past that two years ago. Act like moron, be treated like one. Nothing more nothing less. 
What else you need son?</p>

        <p>Listen son. I hope you live long, happy and healthy life. I hope that mask and vaccine never harm you and that what I think and know become a lie. This is literally what I hope for every day. Also, if Iam a moron for trying to defend people human rights, then let be it. I'm not wearing masks and I'm not being injected with untested vaccine. That means I'm not guinea pig and you are. Yes, you are. You do exactly everything that is being told to you. Wear a mask, check. Be guinea pig for big pharma, check. Yes, I'm the moron. Right.</p>

        <p>Ok dad. Here I am stating that I masked since 2014. So did so many in Asia for pollution before that. </p>
<p>Say what you want about vaccines. Wearing a mask is totally normal. But the clowns you follow, as well as your own stupidity makes you think otherwise.</p>
<p>Yes millions of British, Europeans, asians, americans and others who've been these guinea pigs are fine. But misquote reports and feel insecure. Your funeral. </p>
<p>I'm happy with my vaccination status. Haven't died as yet. Having read the so called arguments as to how the vaccine is harmful I laugh. I'll be laughing more a year from now. </p>

        <p>Yes son. I'm really happy for you. You should wear your mask till you die and also get ready for third vaccine soon, and fourth after that one, also fifth and sixth will follow and so on... Until you actually become a walking vaccine or... Something else. </p>
<p>Regarding millions of worldwide guinea pigs who you're saying are just right, well... I wouldn't say that is true, but you are allowed and recommended to listen CNN and similar propaganda and think everyone is fine. </p>
<p>I do not follow anyone, except of my own free will. Free person fighting for a free world. Nothing else. You see, in our world there is no Fauxi or Gains to tell us how to live, how many vaccines to inject in ourselves or what to wear on our faces and when to hide them. That's your world. </p>
<p>And don't worry about my people being hurt by flu with 99,97% survival rate. We been through much worse then that, just haven been locked for a year and a half for it.</p>

        <p>While you may and wash your masks and wear a new n95 every week, many people don’t do that and reuse the same dirty mask for weeks, so overall people only wear it because it’s required not because it’s “safe and effective.” In all, it’s a useless theatre that provides an illusion of protection.</p>

        <p>Honestly I didnt care initially, I remember sars from younger days. a few folk did mask up even then.</p>
<p>But For me wearing a mask became normal when I was cycling through my smoggy city. </p>
<p>I obviously lower it when I don.t need to, like, if I'm in green parts with less traffic/not interacting with others. Wearing it 24*7 makes no sense.</p>

        <p>Wearing a mask for a couple of minutes while you pop onto the shops is fine.  But as someone who had to wear a mask for 8-12 hrs at a time at work, there is absolutely no way I believe that such extended periods of masking are not harmful to human health.  Everyone I work with has complained about chest pains, migraines, skin lesions, breathing difficulties etc.  These symptoms can last for several days after a shift.</p>

        <p>im not going to disagree with you about extended hours. a sensible person should put them up when its necessary. </p>
<p>My mother and I had a joke about this, we had to wear them inside our car with its own filter which doesnt make sense. </p>
<p>The issue is shops these days are designed for central A/Cs and that's not nice. if there is proper cross ventilation, the need for masking up is only necessary when someone comes close to you if im correct.</p>

        <p>Went bowling with the family last night. People were touching bowling balls and then touching their masks. </p>
<p>The stupidity is real! </p>
<p>Wearing a mask improperly which most people that wear masks do, will most likely induce sickness.</p>
