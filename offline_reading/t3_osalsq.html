    <strong>Fear is the real enemy</strong>
    <p><p>I think the best thing for everyone to do is to stop living in fear. Which the media &amp; government just love spreading. My whole family had covid including myself. My 91 year old grandma even had it and survived and she’s doing great now. No one in my family got the shot. I think people need to stop going with textbook knowledge and use common sense. Why do you think the government is trying to bribe people with lotteries, free college tuition, free tickets NBA-MLB, free food and drinks etc etc. To get the shot for a disease that has a survivability rate of 99%(+)</p>
<p>This vaccine is an emergency use authorization (EUA) vaccine it’s literally an experiment. We are literally witnessing the biggest human vaccine trials in medicine history and there’s a lot of willing participants.</p>
<p>Wonder why the mainstream media is not talking about stuff like this: https://youtu.be/zp_zNSEW1wc ?? Or the FDA making this public yet the Media/Government/Fauci is again not talking about page 16 that lists all the adverse events that the shot can cause https://www.fda.gov/media/143557/download Because it’s not apart of their agenda.</p>
<p>I just want people to stop living their lives with so much fear. Stop letting the media and the government tell you what you should do. The government never cared about our health and well being. If they did they would constantly encourage people to eat healthier, exercise, get enough sleep etc so their quality of life can go up and we would have less people in hospitals. But again the medical industry doesn’t make money from healthy people so why would they do that. You want returning customers that’s how a good business makes money.</p>
<p>Mark Twain said this a long time ago:</p>
<p>“It’s easier to fool people than to convince them that they’ve been fooled”</p></p>
