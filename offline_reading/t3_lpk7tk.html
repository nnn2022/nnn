    <strong>Since we are getting pretty popular and trolls are trying (and miserably failing) to try to flame this sub, I think it's important to review the Gentleperson's Guide To Forum Spies</strong>
    <p><p>If you've never heard of this, I recommend you check out this site to be alert to shills, spooks and all around useful idiots and some of the techniques used to infiltrate a community</p>
<p>https://cryptome.org/2012/07/gent-forum-spies.htm</p>
<p>Some highlights:</p>
<p>&rt;Technique #3 - 'TOPIC DILUTION'</p>
<p>&rt;Topic dilution is not only effective in forum sliding it is also very useful in keeping the forum readers on unrelated and non-productive issues. <strong>This is a critical and useful technique to cause a 'RESOURCE BURN.'</strong> By implementing continual and non-related postings that distract and disrupt (trolling ) the forum readers they are more effectively stopped from anything of any real productivity. If the intensity of gradual dilution is intense enough, the readers will effectively stop researching and simply slip into a 'gossip mode.' In this state they can be more easily misdirected away from facts towards uninformed conjecture and opinion. The less informed they are the more effective and easy it becomes to control the entire group in the direction that you would desire the group to go in. It must be stressed that a proper assessment of the psychological capabilities and levels of education is first determined of the group to determine at what level to 'drive in the wedge.' By being too far off topic too quickly it may trigger censorship by a forum &rt;Sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule. This is also known as the primary 'attack the messenger' ploy, though other methods qualify as variants of that approach. Associate opponents with unpopular titles such as 'kooks', 'right-wing', 'liberal', 'left-wing', 'terrorists', 'conspiracy buffs', 'radicals', 'militia', 'racists', 'religious fanatics', 'sexual deviates', and so forth. This makes others shrink from support out of fear of gaining the same label, and you avoid dealing with issues.

        <p>Another tactic I'm seeing alot is to try to subvert the meaning of this community by making it all about right wing politics. Sure, I hate the far left... But we need everyone to wake up, and alienating people isn't the way to do it. I hate that in normie areas of social media, questioning the lockdowns lumps you in with Qanon, and trying to claim that this is a right wing community isn't helping.</p>
<p>I don't give a fuck about your politics... If you're on the side of freedom and against the new normal, you're alright with me.</p>

        <p>Can't read the full thing atm b/c I have to get back to work, but one thing I was thinking about recently was trolling in form of accelerationism.</p>
<p>Or in other words: Someone pretending to be on the anti-restrictions side but going extremely over board with their posts (i. e. posting some really kooky stuff and insisting on being right, not acknowledging scepticism of any form, etc.). Not only does this plant a case for pro-restriction people to single out and use as an example and a reason to shut something down, it also serves quite well in potentially making newer people, who have dabbled with anti-restriction sentiment for a bit, take a step back and be like "Well, now I'm not gonna do it.".</p>
<p>The entire topic works the other way round as well and I think some people are already doing this, going on normie subs or pro-restriction subs and posting stuff like "They all need to be put in camps!", with the hidden intention to make people understand how we're far beyond the point that we never wanted to reach in the first place.</p>

        <p>Of course. Posting new topics is of course not spamming, as you said, but you neglected to mention within 'time frame'. Multiple posts in a short period of time <em>is</em> spamming. Forum Sliding perhaps? I could be wrong though.</p>
