    <strong>I Bet Most Of The Canadians Have Read The Leak Here. How Do You Protect Your Assets etc At This Point? Seriously, We All Have To Start Thinking About That, At this Point.</strong>
    <p><p>In the leak this was said regarding the government taking over our private property for our own "good." "You will own nothing and will be happy" is commonly being referred to and in the leak it said this:</p>
<p>&rt;Along with that provided road map the Strategic Planning committee was asked to design an effective way of transitioning Canadians to meet a unprecedented economic endeavor. One that would change the face of Canada and forever alter the lives of Canadians.</p>
<p>&rt; What we were told was that in order to offset what was essentially an economic collapse on a international scale, that the federal government was going to offer Canadians a total debt relief. This is how it works: the federal government will offer to eliminate all personal debts (mortgages, loans, credit cards, etc) which all funding will be provided
to Canada by the IMF under what will become known as the World Debt Reset program.</p>
<p>&rt; In exchange for acceptance of this total debt forgiveness the individual would forfeit ownership of any and all property and assets forever. The individual would also have to agree to partake in the COVID-19 and COVID-21 vaccination schedule, which would provide the individual with unrestricted travel and unrestricted living even under a full lock down (through the use of photo identification referred to as Canada’s HealthPass) .</p>
<p>&rt;Committee members asked who would become the owner of the forfeited property and assets in that scenario and what would happen to lenders or financial institutions, we were simply told “the World Debt Reset program will handle all of the details”. Several committee members also questioned what would happen to individuals if they refused to participate in the World Debt Reset program, or the HealthPass, or the vaccination schedule, and the answer we got was very troubling. </p>
<p>&rt;Essentially we were told it was our duty to make sure we came up with a plan to ensure that would never happen. We were told it was in the individuals best interest to participate. When several committee members pushed relentlessly to get an answer we were told that those who refused would first live under the lock down restrictions indefinitely.</p>
<p>&rt;And that over a short period of time as more Canadians transitioned into the debt forgiveness program, the ones who refused to participate would be deemed a public safety risk and would be relocated into isolation facilities. Once in those facilities they would be given two options, participate in the debt forgiveness program and be released, or stay indefinitely in the isolation facility under the classification of a serious public health risk and have all their assets seized.</p>
<p>Indeed very scary, and I'm not suprised that it can happen. As we are being more controlled and restricted from our basic freedoms. What are y'all plans?</p></p>

        <p>But that's not even the problem. Most people who own houses etc and many assets will all never comply. But as said in the leak, they will be made to no matter what. That's the more scary part.</p>

        <p>Please tell me this isn’t real, oh my god what fucking time period am I living through? Exchanging personal debt relief for complete takeover of
Possessions? They think they can stimulate the economy by “incentivizing” its citizens to go buy useless things with money they don’t have so they can reclaim territory and ownership all at the same time. How is this not fascism dressed up in capitalism so long as things go well??</p>

        <p>I wish it fuc*ing wasnt. I still can't get over it, but its coming. Their whole game makes sense if you think about it.</p>
<p>Create a virus, make people fear it (while it has 99.7% survival rate) and then destroy the economy, make vaccines mandatory, and get more power and control. And then as people financially weaken, introduce this bs nonsense and I bet most will comply. F it.</p>
<p>Edit: And oh did I forget, make people fear each other and loss their mental sanity as everything is closed and this all ironically means less birthrates as less people meet and create more of a divide.</p>

        <p>What can I do? Very easy to say that. I can protest, not comply. But then what? I'll either be arrested or cancelled by society. 1 man going in prison or protesting doesn't do shi. The government and people in power will always do what they have to do. Be practical and logical.</p>

        <p>I think that not all Canadians will go for it and there will still be people with private property. Those who need the debt relief will take it and be happy short term but where the problem is, is in a few years maybe a generation later when people start to realize there’s two classes of people. Then you have a people more eager to kill each other</p>

        <p>Our Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland wrote a book around 2011-12 called Plutocrats, read it. In it she mentions that those in Europe and North America will have to see a substantial decline in our way of life to accommodate the emerging markets in China and India. This is the plan of the ultra wealthy, equality for everyone worldwide, equal misery for all unless you're part of their club.</p>

        <p>Lol why do you think the government would allow you to keep your crypto? You can’t hide your online activity from the government. Put it in gold and silver and bury that shit. You pay cash for gold and silver. There’s no Tracing it, unlike crypto. You can use VPNs and shit all you want, but it’s not like the government can’t monitor your screen though other means.</p>
