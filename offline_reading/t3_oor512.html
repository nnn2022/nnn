    <strong>r/CoronavirusUK censorship</strong>
    <p><p>Post removed for misinformation, in reference to vaccination requirement for crowded indoor spaces in UK:</p>
<p>"It's not clubbing. It's indoor crowded spaces, of which night clubs are a subset. Government mandated medicine for entry to some indoor spaces is authoritarian overreach. Business owners should be allowed to decide, then you can use businesses that only allow vaccinated people in."</p>
<p>I don't agree with most of the stuff on r/NoNewNormal but this is one place in which I can record censorship like this.</p></p>

        <p>Even from an epidemiological point of view, it makes no sense. Fully vaccinated individuals don’t have immunity from the virus. The most infectious phase of contracting the virus is the initial mucosal infection and the vaccines do not provide mucosal immunity. These “fully vaccinated approved venues” are going to be government-endorsed super spreader events. Then again, that’s par for the clown course.</p>

        <p>They're perfectly entitled to remove whatever content they like, but people need to realise that when the unqualified decide on what is right or wrong to say, it will largely be opinion-based.</p>

        <p>Another comment censored: "At what severity of consequences do we say that bodily autonomy has been lost? Only if you are held down by force? Only if you are locked into your own home? I'm curious as obviously there is some threshold that will differ between people."</p>
<p>Fyi this is a fairly controversial topic in medicating mental health conditions more generally, happy to cite literature on this. Genuinely surprised that this comment was censored - I am also now muted there. They also responded with reasons for this:</p>
<p>"The idea that infectious disease controls are authoritarian overreach - it is a fact that they are not, as many pluralist, human-rights-observing modern democracies explicitly have laws that allow exactly this sort of control over human interaction during times of pandemic viral spread. </p>
<p>I dont have any proof but I would not be entirely surprised if we found that more non-authoritarian states have such rules than authoritarian states do - because the true dictatorships dont have to pretend to care about the peoples health"</p>
<p>I typed up a full response to this which didn't make it through as I am muted. Are they acting in good faith?</p>
