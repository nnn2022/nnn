        <p>&rt; WITTES: He was writing about a tax dispute between the Pennsylvania General Assembly and the family of the Penns, the proprietary family of the Pennsylvania colony who ruled it from afar. And the legislature was trying to tax the Penn family lands to pay for frontier defense during the French and Indian War. And the Penn family kept instructing the governor to veto. Franklin felt that this was a great affront to the ability of the legislature to govern. And so he actually meant purchase a little temporary safety very literally. The Penn family was trying to give a lump sum of money in exchange for the General Assembly's acknowledging that it did not have the authority to tax it.</p>
<p>&rt;SIEGEL: So far from being a pro-privacy quotation, if anything, it's a pro-taxation and pro-defense spending quotation.</p>

        <p>We still see a common theme especially in countries like Canada of people giving away things that would be deemed as freedoms or privileges for security, ex-extreme no tolerance impairment laws on the roads to combat "drunks on the road"<br>
 the same thing with speeders this is commonplace in Canada we have some of the worst speeding and impairment laws in North America.</p>
<p>I looked at your profile and Idk what to think about the mask posts </p>
<p>Regardless of your opinions on the efficiency of masks I hope that you do not support the bylaws the way they're worded like we have them in Ontario where restaurants and convenience stores can be fined $10,000 if they let someone in without a mask and they have to put a sign up legally or else they can also be find that $10,000 keep in mind this is in a town of 10,000 people very rural no deaths related to Covid in the town and only six in the Township.....</p>
<p>Last summer I watched a pizza place turn away a 12-year-old because he didn't have mask in my small town that's not right I was at the skate park all day and just wanted a fucking slice of pizza..... I could go on but I assume that my cries will fall on deaf ears</p>

        <p>You have to be pretty daft to not see why compulsory mask wearing, not permitting people to do what they want in the privacy of their own homes, forcing children out of school, forcing businesses to shut down, and forcing people to isolate for weeks due to exposure to a virus that has a 99.99% survival rate, is the stripping of essential liberties.</p>

        <p>So wearing a mask for the sake of helping others is stripping our liberties? Also what are they not letting us do in our own homes? And how is wearing a seatbelt any different from wearing a mask?</p>

        <p>In some provinces of Canada, for instance, people aren't allowed to have visitors indoors. In Ontario, you can only have visitors outdoors, which kind of stinks in the middle of winter. Some other provinces like BC have banned both indoor and outdoor gatherings.</p>

        <p>Lemme just copy and paste my response to someone who asked basically the same thing:</p>
<p>Death is inevitable. Everyone dies. I'll die, you'll die, everyone reading this is going to die someday.</p>
<p>Life is precious BECAUSE it ends. I'm not giving the next decade of my life to you.</p>
<p>A lot of people take their freedoms quite seriously, and it's a shame that you don't. A virus with an overwhelmingly high survival rate is no cause to place formerly free citizens under house arrest. People who did nothing wrong. Adults capable of choosing for themselves whether or a not a situation is too risky for them. (House parties, etc.)</p>
<p>It is no reason to forcibly inject people with experimental chemical cocktails.</p>
<p>It's not worth the economic toll. Walmart and Amazon are doing fine, now that they've successfully run every mom and pop shop out of business.</p>
<p>It's not worth the suicides, the overdoses, the homelessness epidemic, the broken lives and families. The mental health crises.</p>
<p>Not to mention the overwhelming loneliness that is so prevalent these days.</p>
<p>Fuck your internet points, if YOU are so worried about it then YOU can lock down, stay 10 feet, 20, 100 feet away from everyone, triple mask, spray everything with lysol, inject yourself with whatever you want because THAT IS YOUR CHOICE.</p>
<p>I do not consent.</p>

        <p>“Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult. To be "cured" against one's will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those who never will; to be classed with infants, imbeciles, and domestic animals.”</p>
