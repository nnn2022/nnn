    <strong>Zoom Vaccine Awareness Event in Singapore</strong>
    <p><p>In a country that can't protest, rally or even say anything against the government. Also why today, it's Singapore's National Day, second, new measures kick in tomorrow. It's differentiated measures, but all of us know what it is. </p>
<p>Unvaccinated can no longer dine in at all, no events whatsoeve. And from Oct 1, people working in public sectors, F&amp;B and healthcare must be swabbed twice a week except for coffee shops. Unvaccinated people can only eat at hawker centers or outdoor dining. And they say it's a concession. </p>

<p>Please note that the event only starts at 1 hour 14 minutes mark. </p>

        <p>East Asia is especially suspectible to covid cult, however, many are waking up especially after restrictions go tougher after mass vaccination.</p>

<p>Here's a post my friend made, and I think it's accurate, but more and more people are growing to anti-restrictions these days.</p>

        <p>Yeah, thanks, although HK does have much more going for it, they have way more of a backbone than SG and I guess for us, the one time we tried it most were terrified of the govt finding out who they were. </p>
<p>But for us, it's due to the new measures tomorrow that would make life really really difficult for us if we do not vaccinate and giving us no other option than that. The other is to take a test twice a week, equivalent to what France is doing.</p>

        <p>Yeah singaporeans are notorious for having domestication mindset, I think LKY made them that way.</p>
<p>Singaporeans has western baizuo (liberal) + eastern conformity culture, literally worst of both sides.</p>
<p>This isn't to say all singaporeans are like that, and the good news is, more are waking up.</p>
<p>Also would it be possible to get exempt like religious or medical reasons? Here a lots of people fake mental illness to get the disabilitybuxx, maybe you can see for yourself if you can do the same.</p>

        <p>No, I don't think so, to us the only option out is to take Sinovac. But given what I heard about it, it's still f no. Either way, what we're likely to do is seek legal discourse next. (You know what that means).</p>
