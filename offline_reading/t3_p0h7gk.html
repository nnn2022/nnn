        <p>My mom got an ovarian cyst a couple weeks after getting the vaccine…. &amp; she got her period after not having it for months due to menopause. She asked our gyno about it possibly being related to the vax and she got shut down right away. Its insane that even our doctors won’t listen to our concerns.</p>

        <p>I didn’t even get it, but I’m the only one in my work place without the vaccine. I didn’t really believe in shedding, but considering I’ve never had such health issues until now… it’s enough to make me believe. The timing is way too convenient to be a coincidence.</p>

        <p>Friend had a Pfizer jab two days before we hung out.  I was in her room sitting on the bed with her hanging out for about 4 hours.  Next morning, I had unexplained menstrual cramps for a couple hours. </p>
<p>My period wasn’t due for over a week and I NEVER get cramps.  Literally have not have them in about 15 years.  That’s one hell of a coincidence </p>
<p>That said, I also work with 80% vaccines people but never had any issue expect for that time with my friend</p>

        <p>Sorry if this is tmi but I’ve had weird, light periods ever since the vax uptake became widespread and I didn’t even get it. I say “weird” because it used to be like old faithful, as in way heavier than the average person.</p>
<p>Granted this could also be due to aging but I’m only 32 and healthy so I don’t think it’s normal menopause. I’m not saying I’m 100% sure it’s from vaccine shedding or whatever but the timing was interesting</p>

        <p>How could other people taking the vaccine be related to changes in the cycle of unvaccinated people? Genuinely asking, is there any explanation for this? I've had long cycles for the past year or so but last month I ovulated 5 days earlier than usual.</p>

        <p>How many women here have NOT taken the injection, but still noticed odd menstrual changes in the past \~6 months?</p>
<p>I personally find the whole vaccine shedding thing pretty unbelievable, looks more like fearmongering than anything else (and I'm very much against this injection) but at the same time, I noticed weird changes after spending time around a jabbed person back in March and apparently there're more women reporting the same. There's a lot we don't know or understand. So... have any women here noticed changes?</p>

        <p>After many months of deathly silence on this subject, Dutch state media recently posted an article saying that it's perfectly normal to have menstrual irregularities and that it's probably just stress.</p>
<p>To me, this suggests that it really must be a huge number. I already noticed countless posts in the CovidVaccinated sub, but that was months before this article. They'll ignore it until they absolutely no longer can, and then they'll try to defuse the situation by gaslighting women into thinking that they're just hysterical. (pun intended)</p>

        <p>I was warned of this by a friend who is subscribed to Del Bigtrees show. I drink Pine needle tea and Indian Fevertree tonic water which is natural quinine. BC wrecked my hormones 10 years ago and I've worked so hard to even get a period and have a regular cycle. But at the same I don't want to have to strike people out of my life or work life due to their decisions so I figure best is to just protect myself. Also I have a friend whose a chemist and showed me that Ibuprofen actually makes the cells close for the time it's in your system and that can be a option if you must closely associate with a vaccinated person. We got people on our side trying to find out proactive solutions here, this is not right.</p>

        <p>She would still get it again I- there’s no hope for these people. They deserve it. Let them eradicate themselves. I know this sounds terrible but I’m sick and tired of these people gaslighting THEMSELVES. At least maybe they won’t be able to reproduce and spread this idiocy to their children. I told my sister about the fertility issues months ago and she said she HOPED it made her infertile. These are the type of people that think having children is selfish and bad for the environment. Welp, next time someone tells me that I will calmly let them know that the best way to reduce carbon emissions and help the environment is to kys.</p>
