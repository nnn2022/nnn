    <strong>My ideas oppose your guys ideas, but since commenting here already got me banned from some subs, who's down for some casual conversation?</strong>
    <p><p>I've been subbed to NoNewNormal for a bit, reading through the other side of the spectrum. I love being able to see other perspectives. I've not agreed with most of them on here, but I've enjoyed seeing your views regardless. </p>
<p>Recently I commented on a post here and got banned from about 8 different Subs. So be it. I might as well make a post and communicate with you guys.</p>
<p>I've heard stories of people getting banned, stories of people being disconnected from family who don't agree with them, and a few other things I really do sympathize with you guys on. </p>
<p>I just kind of want to talk and hear the ways COVID (Or for the people who don't think it's real, the past year or so in general) has effected how people treat you or interact with you.</p></p>

        <p>Most of the far-fetched rabbit holes. A lot of the ideas you have are ones I'm open minded to, but the evidence and proof all seems so irrational.

        <p>I think the lockdown is needed, but I think it should've been handled better. I think masks are effective but I believe the usage is more clear. I've seen the "If you're wearing a mask, why should I?" thing a lot, which just shows that there was a lot of miscommunication on their use. It's more of a sheath for a sword than a shield. </p>
<p>If you specifically wonder why I disagree with this sub about vaccinations, that is a very open question. It seems a lot of you have separate answers or even multiple answers to why you don't want to be vaccinated. I'm not sure if there is an time-effective way for me to non-hastily form an answer here that covers every possible reason, but if you have a personal one I'm down to hear it.</p>

        <p>Oh, I believe that it's real, as does every other dissident I know.  I jokingly say that I was "patient zero for NYC" in November/December 2019, and over time that has become more and more realistic.  I was sick almost non-stop from July 2019 until the lockdown happened in NYC and I was paid enough to stay home that I could finally sleep it off.  I had COVID symptoms in December, including one day when I woke up feeling like my entire nervous system was on fire.  The thing is, the mitigation efforts did nothing but burn my life to the ground after those first few months when I truly needed to get paid to sleep.  </p>
<p>My brother is an OR nurse and a lockdown skeptic.  He never stopped working in the hospital, from day one of this, and he has stories.  He trades anti-lockdown memes by text all the time and has been one of my biggest sources of emotional support as my old social scene has turned against me.  </p>
<p>My dad is 77 years old and lost friends to COVID; he's still a lockdown skeptic and never stopped his life.  My mom is the most intense anti-lockdown person I know besides myself.  </p>
<p>I'm REALLY lucky that my immediate family supports me, because this has been absolute hell on my social life for the most part.  I have a "friend" who alternates between begging me to come back to NYC and bullying me for my beliefs, and I think she's a total bitch for calling me a conspiracy theorist and I'm glad I ghosted on her lol.</p>

        <p>I was really concerned that my friends were all going to shut me out, but at least my core group was willing to make some accommodations and felt protected enough by their own vaccines that subjecting me to deep psychological stressors that were driving me to suicide wasn't going to get me to get the vax, just consider moving to a red state.</p>
<p>My family are all concerned.  I'm worried about the terrible future when they won't let us work or buy food for resisting them, but personal integrity is a hill worth dying on, so I'm bracing for that.  Pockets of resistance still give some hope that we can live on, even if the rest of the world shuts us away.  Giving up personal freedom for a disease that has killed just a handful of people in my age group in my state is just illogical.  I was concerned when I thought it would be like 10% generally fatal, but that's not what it is and the scale is exponential too.</p>

        <p>I am, like many of us here are, not an anti-vaxxer. I am for vaccines, I'm just not for <em>this</em> vaccine. </p>
<p>Many of us feel that the experimental nature of this vaccine cannot be ignored. This type of medication has never ever been approved before and is <em>still currently not approved</em>. I find the flagrant use of the EUA rather alarming. </p>
<p>The most alarming part of this is the mandatory nature of this. For some reason <em>"my body, my choice"</em> no longer matters. Now, it can be argued that this isn't mandatory but with vaccine passports and private businesses making it mandatory for their patrons and employees the people who choose to go unvaccinated will be pushed out of society. This will create parallel economies and that isn't good. </p>
<p>What is so dangerous about us being left alone? If your vaccine works then if you take it you are protected right? You don't need me to be vaccinated to make your vaccine work better, that's just not how it supposed to work. Now we see that these vaccines are actually much less effective than originally promised. We have gone from 95% effective down to 65% effective. Booster shots are already in the works and to no one's a surprise they have been planned all along. <em>How many booster shots are you comfortable taking?</em></p>
<p>Then we have this weird thing happening where everyone on the left is now calling for us to be murdered, hunted down, hoping for our slow and painful death, they hope we get covid and die. We are called names like plague rats, disease vectors, etc. </p>
<p>Most of us just want to be left alone. You want to get back to normal. The regular normal.</p>

        <p>You have a lot to say and none of it lost here, I'm all ears rather or not it has the effect on me you'd hope.</p>
<p>Are there any variations of the COVID vaccine you're more concerned about than others?</p>
<p>If he booster shot question is non-rhetorical, I'm not quite sure.</p>
<p>I also can't say I've seen a lot of that. I don't doubt you have experienced it, but I personally haven't witnessed any such treatment when unprovoked. I've seen both the left and right call each other nasty names when angered, that's what people do, and I really think that anger we all may feel due to name calling is a hinderance to us listening to each other. It's hard to communicate with people you've convinced yourself you hate, and it's even harder to understand them. Understanding is the biggest part of an effective and constructive conversation.</p>
