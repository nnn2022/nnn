    <strong>Everything's fucked.</strong>
    <p><p>I see no point in living anymore. If I wasn't a teenager living with my parents, I would have already killed myself. Everyone is swallowing this crap and no one believes me. This won't ever get better. I don't want to live my whole life as a slave trapped in my house, but there's nothing I can do. I feel trapped. I don't want to live but I also don't want to die. If this doesn't get better (which it probably won't) until '22, I might have to really think about suicide. What's the point of living if my whole life is going to be like this? I'm fucking done.</p></p>

        <p>Hey man, I'm a teenager too so I understand. My anxiety disorder has gotten way worse lately, I've had anxiety attacks when I haven't had them in years. I feel trapped too. I've thought about *it* too. But you and I can't do that. It's hard to see it now but this WILL pass. If you want any advice, the best thing I've done for myself was to make a routine. I wake up at a certain time, make my bed, journal, cook breakfast, clean up my room, study, read books, play video games, go jogging, etc. I fill up my day with so many things that make me happy that I can pretend that lockdown doesn't exist anymore. I seriously recommend going outside for 30 mins+ every day. It has done wonders for my mental health. Keep yourself active and busy until all this bullshit subsides. If you want to talk, feel free to PM me. All the best man :)</p>

<p>Getting out in nature will help a lot.   Find a hobby or skill where you work with your hands - welding, metalworking, woodworking.  Get an old car or motorcycle to fix up.</p>

        <p>I don't know if it helps since the people closest to me can see through this bullshit. But if anything, I've felt more inspired to be better than the mask-hugging morons that cater to the whims of the tyrannical idiots in power.</p>
<p>The idea of becoming a blob of fear, paranoia, and uncertainty frightens me more than the virus itself. So I work on myself. And already being unhealthy was not a good choice for me. I guess the masses that are happy to sit in their own tears and fat kinda sparked something in me to do better.</p>
<p>So I stopped watching the news, I stopped with most journalism, and I filled my time with taking care of myself through exercising, learning new things, reading more, exploring more music. Those kinds of things may not fill the void for everybody, but I find it much more fulfilling than hanging on every molecule of diarrhea that spews out of Fauci's mouth.</p>
<p>Take a step back, try something new, and focus on your own mind. It is definitely jarring that everyone else refuses to look past the layers of shit, but that's completely out of your control. Why worry about something you have no control over? That's up to them to decide.</p>

        <p>Don't do it. The world needs people like you. Suicide is like giving up on life. Rather, fight till the end and don't fear death.</p>
<p>&rt;This won't ever get better. I don't want to live my whole life as a slave trapped in my house, but there's nothing I can do.</p>
<p>This is facts. I would rather live 1 day as a lion having all the freedom, than a slave all My life to this evil government. But, the best thing is fight for your rights. Me? Idc anymore,  and I'm on the same boat as you, but I personally don't see a point  to live a long life in the current situation we live. Because, it will only get worse, and the good days that we had are far past us now. It's all downhill from here.</p>
<p>So, I thought about it, and realized just enjoy whatever till we can, and just do whatever and mainly do good an have whatever of an impact we can and stand up for the truth. Never give up on the mercy of God. He is always watching, listening and  sees us. He'll truly give us what we deserve in the end. But we have to be patient and hopeful.</p>

        <p>Don’t help death. It’s inevitable and not our choice. Living however is not inevitable and is our choice. Rage against the dying of the light. Live as much as you can and help as much as you can. You may be surprised and shocked as how much people you may have not yet met need you. You are a precious soul. A unique perspective of the universe experiencing itself. Don’t waste it. Death will come some day and doesn’t need your help. Life needs your help.</p>

        <p>Trust me, a lot of us feel that way. I’m young too. I’m not gonna lie, some days I wake up and think about all this shit and I want to take myself out of this realm. But one thing you never do in this life is surrender. To your enemy, to a threat, to your battles. You don’t give up. Ride this shit out, with the rest of us, you are here for a reason. Life is a GIFT, no matter how shit it gets, don’t let them extinguish your flame. The point of all of this garbage is to crack people down, get them to submit, make them feel HOW YOURE FEELING. don’t let them win, you’re better than this and you know it. And the people doing this to us know it too. Don’t let them drain you of your life force. A time will come when you’re finished here on this realm. &amp; you won’t get to decide. Be thankful of every moment til then, you incarnated on this Earth for a reason, search for that reason. Find something you care about. Something you want to learn. You’ve got a whole world of knowledge at your fingertips. Watch documentaries. Whatever it may be that keeps you going, do it with love. Best way to live, attitude of gratitude. Finally, allow yourself to be ruled by logic, not emotion. Don’t throw your life away for some selfish old fucks. They’re trying to squeeze it out of you.</p>

<p>ETA: Downvoted. OF COURSE</p>

        <p>Well wouldn’t the end of times be considered better? Even with all the shit going on people are living normal lives and things are getting better for them. You can think what you want but your opinion is not the same as the truth. It’s asinine to think this young persons life can’t get better than what it is now</p>

        <p>Yes this is indeed the end times that every religion has talked about including the bible. What you don’t realize is that ultimately it’s about humanity waking up, taking our power back and bringing in a new more enlightened society. God will bring heaven on earth as we shift to a new dimension. </p>
<p>We have a 12000 year cycle on earth that seems to bring in a civilization ending event. Massive floods the sun exploding with energy, the magnetic fields are reversing as we speak. We have evidence of highly evolved ancient societies with amazing technology who seemingly vanished. Some of these societies shifted to another dimension while the rest was perished like the story of atlantis.</p>
<p>If you are truly religious then you know how important faith is. It’s not about you or me but the future generations which we must not give up on and who God certainly hasn’t given up on. Humanity btw has survived every single one of these transitions or doomsday events and these happened many times in our evolution. We are the survivors of all these catastrophes and we will survive this one. I mean we survived a damn ice age humans are pretty damn resilient. Look into people who really studied these topics like Randall Carlson and understand that our ancestors and yes even Jesus came to warn us about this time. It’s not the end though for those who have faith, it’s not the end for the children, it not the end for humanity so please allow God to show you how beautiful the world will look when this is all done because humanity is far from over in our evolution. We have the potential to live at much higher states than the third dimension and we are so powerful because we have that divine connection to source to God, it’s why so many people/entities want to control you and steal your energy, they hate how free humans really are.</p>

        <p>You are correct, young one. Shit is very fucked. I know it is cold comfort, but you have a responsibly to stay here and be your best self. My best friend killed himself years ago. The problems he killed himself over would have been solved by now, and he would be 32 this year. This world cannot be taken all at once without crushing you with its enormity. My advice to you is to reduce back to the short list of things that make you NOT want to move on and to live for those things. This will pass, and even if it does so through war and violence, we need you then as well. I took the rounds out of my revolver when I was at my worst this year, just to put an extra action between me and death. My revolver is loaded and in my drawer again. It gets better. Much love.</p>

        <p>You feel trapped, because you are trapped, and depending on your actual age and how far back your memories go, 10-20% of your life were under the tyranny of these events. That sucks donkey balls. However, you are probably in the first 20% of your whole life. </p>
<p>To make sense of all this, you might want to research past waves of hysteria, which roll round the world from time to time. Unfortunately memory fades fast and tends to color the past in softer colors and more pleasant noises than were actually present. Look up the sentiments around the attacks of 9/11, when everyone was scared of homeland attacks, even in the most remote parts of the Midwest. Every person that looked halfway Middle-Eastern was a potential terrorist and every nitwit with a name tag thought that they were the front line in a holy fight for US national security. Or you check up on the Vietnam war protests that led the United States into spitting distance of civil war. Or the McCarthy era, when even the monsters under the kids' beds and their moms were scared of communists. </p>
<p>As these waves of hysteria, this, too, shall pass. Given the reactions of governments all over the world, we should consider ourselves lucky that the damn virus isn't the second coming of the Spanish Flu or the Black Plague. Now that would have been a disaster. </p>
<p>The world on the other side will be different than it was before, but the same way the COVID doomers are wrong, so are the doomsday prophets with their visions of jackboots and concentration camps. </p>
<p>Times are tough and they will stay that way for some time. But the end of this will come. Until then, there is only patience and reflection.</p>

        <p>You are not trapped in your house. I kept working through the worst of this and have continued to travel. I have never been stopped or bothered during any of my trips. I dont want to live either because I lost someone I loved during this mess but I survive as best I can. If you are in the US consider taking a trip to Florida. I was there recently and its back to normal in the southern areas.</p>

        <p>to read all the answers, all the experiences shared, advise given how to pull oneself out of depression ... just wow ... beautiful internet family, you are doing great</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>mmmh... however ... about the ... there is nothing I can do </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I believe what we can do is to go deeper than just to understand how a lot of people have insecurities about their own body, mind and soul ... many do not really trust their own inborn wisdom but rely more on pharmaceutical medications and what the medical doctors diagnose </p>
<p>also many of us human beings are just too plain lazy or scared to look at the real cause of discomfort / unwellness in the physical body ... that is what the bacteria and viruses are here for, they come to visit us to check us out, to see if we have done the cleaning of our spiritual/mental/emotional/physical home/fields/body</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>so if I know about this ... if I am thankful towards the coronavirus and every other virus and bacteria strain to show me where I need to do some more cleaning inside myself, some more inner-self-optimization ( I don't mean here the ... learning a new skill to make some money stuff ... more like ... with whom I have a grudge I am not willing to let go, what event in my life am I continuing to push away whenever it comes up again to be looked at ... which part of my body feels like there is some blockage, some obstruction ... )  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>if all this is done allready ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>then there is still a possibility to dive one more time deeper</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>to analyse the human society global history</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>how long are we living allready in a hierarchical pyramid structure</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>how many thousand years of ... a few dominate most everyone ... have we experienced already ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the few making the many believe that they would know better or would be chosen by supernatural powers to be at the dominators position  </p>
<p>seen from my viewpoint ... it is us who are reluctant to get to the bottom of it all ... </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>it is us who are reluctant to change the very basic contract of our society ... our regional states constitutions and our nation states constitutions ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>because there are the foundations what allow the ones who are elected to the top at any moment to seize the opportunity to try to establish a dictatorial / tyrannical timeframe</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I believe that if we would do away with these hierarchies what are inbuilt in our state constitutions ... if we would do away with these emergency law possibilities ... we could prevent something like what  some try to make it happen ... conditioning most everyone to expect freedom of movement and freedom of assembly taken away at any time ...  </p>
<p>so here comes my proposal :</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>let us prepare a future where all political hierarchies are dissolved ... where nation states and regional states abdicate and hand over all political powers to the local community, the village, the town, the city-district ... so that all permanent residents, all children, youth and adults who live here and now in this neighbourhood will be able to create, maintain and interpret the law what is valid on the territory of this local community</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>but how could we get there ... how could such a renewed regional state constitution and such a renewed nation state constitution be formulated .... perhaps phrases like these ones could be of assistance:  </p>
<p>----<br>
the local community, the village, the town, the city-district is its own absolute political sovereign. it receives/inherits all political decision powers from both the regional state as well as from the nation state</p>
<p>the local sovereign community creates, maintains and interpretes the local law, a set of rules what all inhabitants living here and now, permanent residents, are agreeing upon in an every resident including manner. this local law replaces all laws previously made on both regional state level as well as on nation state level</p>
<p>all local sovereign communities receive/inherit a share of the financial and material wealth of both the regional state as well as of the nation state, the size of the share corresponding to the number of communal residents</p>
<p>every local sovereign community at all times is able without conditions to leave/quit/exit both the regional state as well as the nation state</p>
<p>-----</p>

        <p>as I understand it ... we still live in a framework what comes from the feudalistic structure ... the king chooses feudal families which choose the rules for the villages/towns/cities they are given ownership by the king ( ... the assumption there being that the king would be chosen by god to own all the land and would have the god given power to decide who can use it for what purpose ... )  </p>
<p>today ... the king is being replaced by the nation state what is represented by the national parliamentary assembly ... a few hundred people elected to make the rules, the law for their fellow millions of human beings</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>and the feudal families are being replaced with the regional states represented by the regional parliamentary assembly ... also some hundreds or less ... elected people who make the rules, the laws what are still open for interpretation after the national parliamentary assembly has set the framework</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>and at the bottom are as allways the villages, the towns, the cities ... the local communities</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>by simply dissolving this hierarchy and shifting all political powers to the local community ... by dissolving both the national parliamentary assembly and the regional parliamentary assembly so that only the full assembly of all local residents of a local community remains as the only place where the law is made<br>
the circle of all who are each others neighbours ... create the laws what are valid in this neighbourhood</p>
<p>it is so simple<br>
the moment we choose someone else to make the law for us ... we are fucked<br>
the moment we say ... no more representatives no more ... no more electing other people to make the law ... now we want to create the law what we are willing to live with in the circle of all human beings who live here and now as permanent residents<br>
from this moment on we unfuck ourselves but engage in respectfull dialog looking each other in the eyes at the same level<br>
knowing that this here and now, this meeting of all who are concerned about a topic, all who are living here in this local community as permanent residents are able to vote on what we are going to do to solve it... how are we going to live with each other on a daily basis so that everyones needs are covered and everyone is free to do as one feels it being suitable</p>

        <p>perhaps the most basic mistake what we human beings make ... is to declare the land as our property</p>
<p>todays nation state declares itself as the successor of the previous monarch what declared him/herself being chosen by god to rule over everyone else and to own all the land</p>
<p>the regional state also buys into this stupidity by sucking up to the nation state and mostly doing the dirty work for the nation state ... oppressing the local communities, telling the villagers, town residents, city dwellers what they little bits they got left to decide on their own after the nation state representatives and regional state representatives have allready decided most of the important matters</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>after the consequential decentralisation would be achieved eventually in the not so far away future ... hopefully ... when the local community would have received its absolute sovereignty... when the circle of all children, youth and adults which live here and now as permanent residents, each one with the same weighted voting power ... could finally make all the laws, decide all the rules under or with they would be willing to live</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>then there is still this very basic human mistake to undo</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>so ... even when we have done away with all the human hierarchies ... when we have deconstructed the pyramid structure on the political societal level ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>there is still the land waiting to be freed from the human dominance  </p>
<p>what I am trying to say here ... there is lots to do ... lots to change and to prepare for these changes  </p>
<p>one possibility to try to think of the land not as in possession of the human being could be to think of the human being as its steward ... of course this is stupid too as the land does not need the human being to be looked after ... the land sustains itself ... the animals and plants live in a most complex and beautiful web of life where multiple actors at all times dynamically impregnate each other and the very land with their behaviour which most of the times is of entertainment and enriching for the land ... the land is happy with wildlife playing on in und under it ...  </p>
<p>but ... stewardship of land ... could be one way forward to get away of this desaster what we are experiencing since some thousands of years since the idea of the empire arised</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the human being as the steward of the land ... or better said ... the local community ... the circle of all permanent residents, all children, youth and adults who live here and now on a permanent basis ...<br>
might have a chance especially thanks to allowing the children and youth too to participate, as to also consider the wild living animals and unregulated plant networks as being most important to give space </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>and again ... its stupid to think that the human being would be entitled to give space to wildlife</p>
<p>the land belongs to itself, the very planet is a sovereign entity</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>and if we truly want to live in harmony ... If we want to live as one of many actors in the play of the web of life ... we better stop restricting the movement of people  ... we better stop hindering people to migrate how they feel they need to </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>but try to open up to what wants to come ... let go what is permanently trying to pull away ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>allowing the tides to do its work ... </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>surrender not to nation states, regional states or any other self-increasing entity</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>but surrender to the dynamics of the whole</p>

        <p>I have recently calculated that if everyone of the 500 million people who live in the european union would receive 1000 m2 of fertile land as free lease for lifetime from the local sovereign community ... no tax to be paid, no. rent to be paid, no duty coming with the use of the land except to not pollute water, air and the land ...  </p>
<p>there would still be enough land on top of ... what could be given back to wildlife </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>( I know its wrong to say it like that ... the land is not ours to give ... but we come from this stupid past where we collectively let ourselves be enchanted by the churches and feudal violent rulers into believing that god would have chosen human beings to dominate animals and plants ... )  </p>
<p>that is why I have included the third part of my above mentioned proposal how the states constitutions could be renewed... the third part about how the regional and nation states would distribute their financial and material posessions towards the local sovereign communities, proportional to the number of permanent residents per local community</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>these financial and material wealth assets could then be used by the local sovereign communities to free the land away from private ownership ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>provided the full assembly of all children, youth and adults living permanently in a local sovereign community would see the importance of freeing the land from being privately owned</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>so the private "owners" of agricultural and forest lands could receive offers of compensation, offers of financial material values being exchanged in case they would be willing to let go of the "title" to "their" lands</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>in my understanding ... to embark on the journey of becoming humble again ... leaving the self-important dominators place and start playing fair again with the fellow animal and plant species  </p>
<p>would be greatly helped by the acknowledgement of stuff done wrong in the past and the willingness to repair them</p>

<p>(...) the  potential amount of people what all these spaces mentioned above could  nourish sustainably ... could be as high as 1840 million human beings  living each on a 500 m2 plot of fertile land if  one would for example think far forward into the future ... like a  hundred or two hundred years ... humanity could for example give half of  the space it occupies today ... back to wildlife ... let grasslands  grow to sustain wild animals and forests regrow on it ..  even if half of all the agricultural area would be given back to nature  voluntarily ... there would remain  a potential of 920 million human  being what would occupy each one 500 m2 of fertile land for a  self-sustaining lifestyle, resulting in human occupancy of 46 million  hectares the european union has today 446 million inhabitants --- as a result of these calculations one could easily say that  it would be no problem at all for these european countries  ( altough  switzerland is not member of the european union it is very much  connected to the economies of its european neighbours ) to invite the 80 million refugees of today to come and live here but why ? because  eventually the political destabilisation in many parts of the world  what has caused these 80 million people to become refugees, to have to  flee from their homes and live today in very difficult situations in  refugee camps the causes for these 80 million human beings having no home no more is also the european history of feudal families with the blessing of the churches colonising africa, asia, the americas, australia swiss  business people too have been very active in helping these bandits  calling themselves monarchs or nobles, generating enormous amounts of  wealth by assisting the imperial extension of their dominions -------- not  only have 11 million african human beings been abducted in the  transatlantic slave trade to the americas ... but also their descendants  were enslaved for many generations and were forced to work on  plantations, producing sugar and cotton for europeans  ( and swiss ) who  occupied the land in the americas what have been stolen from the  indigenous people the degree to what todays european financial wealth is owed to the enormously cruel and unfair colonial past behaviour... is enormous i personally would guess that a minimum of 30 percent of all the wealth both public as private in europe today was generated during colonial times</p>
