    <strong>How have the lockdowns changed you? Love to hear, if at all, how the last year has affected you guys.</strong>
    <p><p>For me, I have a stronger grasp of the big picture and have definitely toughened up and am now ready to resist and fight. Wouldn’t have thought I would a year ago, but now many things have clarified and solidified in me.</p>
<p>As much as I am deeply concerned with the world’s development, I feel I am now awaiting further (inner) instructions and recognise the importance of making ones life and actions meaningful and purposeful. This crisis has given me the opportunity of doing something meaningful now (or soon).</p>
<p>John Waters (the Irish one) has talked about how significant this period is and can be, and how it allows one the privilege of fighting in a truly heroic way for ones beliefs. An opportunity not to be wasted.</p>
<p>I work in a school, have been vocal about my extreme misgivings from the start but, with full time mask mandates coming from the 8th March and the looming presence of vaccines for kids, I think it’s time to up my game. Not too worried about getting fired. It was always only a matter of time.</p>
<p>How about you? However you feel about the COVID and the lockdowns, how have they changed you?</p></p>
