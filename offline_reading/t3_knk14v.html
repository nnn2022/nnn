        <p>You know what's going to happen next right?</p>
<p>We're never going to sporting events or concerts again you or I.  They will now be reserved for the elite.  They say it's "open" for 6,700 people.  But you know none of those people will be us.  They will never be us.  They will always, always be the corporate, white-collar, well-connected,  government-approved ally or friend of the modern technocracy.  They probably won't even have to get tested (they'll just start pretending they were tested).</p>
<p>Then the elite will have the stadiums and artists all to themselves while we're told we can't even see our grandmothers on Christmas.</p>
<p>You know this is coming.  You will never be able to attend one of these events ever again.  And you will be forced to watch as the politicians and the fuckfaces of society like the Cuomo brothers get entire rows to themselves so they can gorge away on their feast.</p>
<p>Fuck these people.  </p>
<p>We will never forget what they have done to us.</p>

        <p>I agree except for one thing:</p>
<p>&rt;And you will be forced to watch</p>
<p>Oh, no, the fuck we won't.  This is as good a reason as any to drop professional sports like a lead weight.  Let the viewership figures plummet.  Let the ad revenue dry up.  Let it become a ghost town and them wonder where everybody went.  And when they figure out where they went wrong, let the response be a resounding "too late."</p>
