    <p><p>My husband got this months ago.  At first he complained of knee pain.  Now he says he has back and leg pain.  He has sleep disturbances and bad dreams and is emotional more than he used to be.  Anybody else feel this way or know somebody who has?</p></p>

        <p>Sounds to me like vaccine-induced man-opause. </p>
<p>Seriously though sounds like hormonal disturbances and other issues. If only we had long term studies to show the effects of the vaccine on hormones...</p>

        <p>My dad has the following symptoms from the Pfizer vaccine:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shortness of breath</li>
<li>Tired all the time</li>
<li>A worsening cough</li>
<li>Cognitive decline</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter is the scariest.</p>
<p>Listen to Dr. Charles Hoffe. Get your husband a D-DIMER test if you can. It detects micro-clots. According to Hoffe, in about 62% of his patients --- microclots are happening in the body and lodging in random organs, which creates a range of side effects.</p>
<p>I would advise your husband to avoid future shots. You may have noticed that Canada &amp; Isreal both announced purchase orders for a shot this year, a shot the next year, and two shots after that.</p>
<p>Isn't it curious that they have a regimen of shots already planned?</p>
<p>For me, that is one of the many reasons to say no.</p>

        <p>I know I have read other posts about the pain. I suggest you watch this video for some info and possibilities. It's Joe Rogan talking to Jimmy Dore about his side effects and what he did to deal with them. There are also tons of comments that might have some info. https://youtu.be/UiLGSVH_UPA</p>

        <p>That sounds like me but I'm not vaccinated, I'm covid recovered. I had covid last year and it was bad but once recovered I noticed that my knees and hips ache, even now they ache. I also noticed that my ADHD was no longer manageable without medication and I've been managing it for 37 years. I now have pretty dramatic emotional dysregulation. While I was sick the virus stopped my ability to produce testosterone and I was very emotional. I even cried when Ross and Rachel broke up on <em>Friends</em>... <em>They were on a break!</em> </p>
<p>The spike proteins that are in covid are broadly similar to the vaccine and are cytotoxic. They are very damaging to the body and they cross the blood brain barrier. In my case the spike proteins were in my kidneys, my testes, and my brain, as well as causing serious blood clotting. They smash through a person's body like Miley Cyrus on a wrecking ball.</p>
<p>Your husband could have a lower testosterone count as a result or perhaps a mental health issue that he didn't know about and because of the spike proteins has moved into the forefront.</p>
