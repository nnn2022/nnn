        <p>“Kulldorff acknowledged the best of the 2 ways to acquire herd immunity in a population is through a vaccine.” https://www.contagionlive.com/view/herd-immunity-addressed-great-barrington-declaration.  So it turns out Twitter was right. Kulldorrf is misquoted. Also, his quote was made before the current vaccine was even made, it’s a hypothetical statement.</p>
