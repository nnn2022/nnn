        <p>From the article:</p>
<p>&rt; On Tuesday, James Madison University decided to join the colleges making the temporary transition to online classes.</p>
<p>&rt; Some 6,000 JMU students living on campus are being asked to move out by Monday, Sept. 8.</p>
<p>&rt; Sick students in quarantine or isolation can stay on campus for the time being and other students can request to stay.</p>
<p>&rt; Caitlyn Read, a university spokesperson, said several hundred students have already filed exemption requests.</p>
<p>&rt; “Some exemptions that we commonly see are people have immune-compromised relatives at home or if they’re going to a region where there’s a bad outbreak and it’s actually safer for them to stay here,” Read said. “We also know that some of our students don’t have a home to go home to, that JMU might be the most stable place they’re ever lived, in terms of housing and food security.”</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>&rt; “This decision was made in the best interest of public health and safety. It’s what is best for our on-campus population at this time.”</p>
<p>I facepalm reading this... Ugh.</p>
<p>Anyway, <a href="https://www.change.org/p/president-alger-jmu-allow-jmu-on-campus-students-to-stay-in-dorms-and-learn-online?use_react=false">there is a petition linked in the article</a>. It does state that students should do online classes, however, just not get kicked out of their dorms.</p>

        <p>Yeah, my stance is that if JMU ever considered not completing the entire semester on campus, they should have never brought everyone back and just had the semester online from the outset.  Because now, they're in the campus environment, and JMU completely owns it.  If their goal was allegedly to stop the spread, this isn't how to do it.  In fact, they've done quite the opposite, bringing everyone together from all over, spreading the germs around, and then sending them back from whence they came to spread some more.</p>
<p>Really, this whole thing is an example of why trying to stop this thing is an exercise in futility.  It has to be allowed run its course, and all of these alleged "precautions" do nothing.  Even with all of the distancing and masking and everything, it's still spreading, and there's nothing that we can do about it.  Thus why we should never have started turning the world on its head over this.</p>
