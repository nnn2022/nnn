        <p>&rt;  Therefore, school closure is equivalent to a very mild social  distancing of the entire population, in which the contacts are only  reduced by 4.16%. Thus, school closure alone may not work as effectively  as one would have expected. A recent systematic review<a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/5.0040560#">49</a>  also concluded that there are no data on the relative contribution of  school closures to transmission control and some modeling studies proved  that school closure would prevent only 2%â€“4% deceased cases.<a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/5.0040560#">4</a> </p>
<p>Even when using the Neil Ferguson model where cases are assumed higher than reported through positive tests, closing schools only prevents children from being children. </p>
<p>&rt;Counterintuitively, we find that nearly all the countries decided to  close the schools, while our model shows that it is not that much  effective in controlling the epidemic. As shown in <a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/5.0040560#">Fig. 4</a>,  school closure would only slightly reduce the number of total  infections compared to the extreme theoretical no intervention policy.</p>

<p>just found out how sCiEnCe describes my philosophy.</p>
<p>Too bad they didn't look at how masks reduce transmission, but theoretically it would be bullshit. masks are a pharmaceutical intervention anyhow.</p>
