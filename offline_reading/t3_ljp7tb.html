    <strong>Considering dropping out of college - Looking for advice</strong>
    <p><p>Hi all. I'm a freshmen in college and I'm seriously considering dropping out due to online "education". I  don't want to sound like a doomer but I think the whole situation is completely hopeless. I've even considered suicide as an option but I guess it's worth living, maybe we may see the end (!) of the pandemic some time. I'm 20 now, gonna turn 21 very soon and I was 19 when the pandemic first started. I think I've already missed out a large part of my best years so I don't really want to go on like this.</p>
<p>I'm okay with dropping out of college as long as I can go out and fucking interact with people. I'm even okay with being fucking homeless if that's what it takes, at least I would be able to see some people and interact with others. I just don't want to spend another 3 years of college looking at a screen all day with no human contact.</p>
<p>Also I'd like to add that I don't think the normal life we knew is ever coming back. Thanks (!) to all the bullshit fear mongering, everyone I know have already turned into sheeps who believe that covid has a 99% mortality rate and my grandma will die if my college goes back to fully normal in-person.</p>
<p>I gave up completely. Even the idea of being able to return to campus in-person seems impossible to me. I know it will never happen, even if it does, it would be after I graduate from college. Any suggestions?</p></p>

        <p>Old guy here, don't ignore the long term.</p>
<p>If you can get through college with a degree, it will serve you well. There are countless good reasons to believe college is overrated, but in general, its still a net gain financially. With online courses, you should have even more time than usual to spend with friends and be social.  Don't neglect the social, but most never go back to college, so this is your probably your one shot.</p>
<p>If you're seriously self motivated, you can work and learn on your own and find the contacts you need for the job you want and get past the interview catch of not having a degree. It's entirely possible, but more frustrating, and more difficult. Maybe more satisfying in the long run, and college isn't offering the social value it should, but it shouldn't be considered an ways decision.</p>
<p>I dropped out of college, had some serious difficulty finding my first real job, and ended up getting lucky, despite a great deal of programming and math experience, far in excess of what I was being taught. Unless you have an actual plan otherwise, I'd recommend staying in college. If you can make a betterong term career plan, are willing to fight a bit harder, then it's an option.</p>

        <p>What's the point if it will be online from now on? I don't want to continue if that will be the case. I know there will be people who will tell me to fucking man up but they are the real cowards if they think I'm weak because I'm fucking sad at the fact that I'm fucking missing out my college years. How do you people even fucking cope?</p>

        <p>I think it's disgusting that you're missing your college experience. Mine was suboptimal, but still memorable and vital to my development. Regardless, unless you're going to restart in a year or two when things return to normal, or go somewhere you can have a normal college experience, you need to find another way to enjoy the time.</p>
<p>Even without the social though, that degree still has value. It shouldn't, but it does. Also, learning can and does happen in colleges. Sometimes.</p>
<p>This is far from ideal, but it may still be the best choice to continue classes.</p>
<p>Shack up with someone in florida or another free state, visit bars with friends, take courses online as appropriate to get your degree?</p>

        <p>Find a college that is in person, in a state that doesn’t have strict lockdowns. My daughter is in college, lives in a house with 3 room mates. Has some in person classes and still does life normal for the most part. Of course she has to wear the damn mask but it seems her school uses common sense when it comes to it. </p>
<p>Make sure your degree really benefits you and isn’t some lame ass art history degree. There is still a financial gain to going to college. </p>
<p>You also have to find the right people. There are people out there who aren’t sheep and aren’t scared. I promise.</p>

        <p>I think it could go back at some point and I think you would find like minded older students like yourself who waited this out. As I said before, and I am truly not trying to be insensitive, but aging will not stop you from being outgoing and social. All of my friends here are 30+ and child free and there was always some frat level shit going on with them on both weeknights and weekends. I had as much, if not more fun with them these last few years than I ever did in my 20s.</p>

        <p>Hey OP, don’t give up on the college thing entirely but you need a solid plan. Its  harder to go back later in life. I did and I can tell you its more difficult. But at the same time, college may not be right for you. Plenty of happy and well fed people out there with no college. </p>

        <p>I’m not giving you any advice because at the end of the day - it’s ultimately your decision. But I know if it were me (who graduated from college back in 2014) I wouldn’t pay the outrageous prices of college for all online courses and no social interactions/partying. Even though I managed to get the most over priced piece of paper (a degree) the social aspect is what kept me there for 4 (well really 5, but whose counting) to be able to graduate. I also do not learn well virtually, I get so much more out of in person learning.</p>

        <p>I dropped out and don't regret it. I had some shitty jobs along the way instead of the promised "graduate and get a good job right out of school" thing that's a myth anyway. At least I was making money instead of spending it.</p>

        <p>Yeah sometimes I think college is a huge waste of money. I even feel like I'm a burden on my parents because of it. The thing is, imo college experience is worth it because it gives you a lot of opportunities in terms of social development. But yeah, covid ruined all of these so it's worthless now.</p>

        <p>This is a hard question that only you can answer. First off, what field are you trying to get into? If you don't know and are just in college because you've been told that's the way to have a guaranteed good income, then I'd get out. Those days are over. Every person I know who has a college degree is either working an entry level position that needs only a high school diploma, or has their own small cleaning business &amp; that type of thing.  Now if you have a clear goal in mind (doctor, lawyer, etc) and college is the only way to get there, I'd say keep with it. But the world is changing. It's really hard to say what the job landscape is going to be in the next 10 years. Probably a lot of "enforcement" positions. Try to stay positive and tune out the bullshit as much as possible. I know It's hard because it's everywhere.</p>

        <p>As an older adult who took the plunge and went back to college for a career change I too am confused about continuing. My program is 2 years and we finished 2nd semester on line, I did 2 summer classes on line and 3rd semester also on line. Unfortunately, I did not pass a class in 3rd semester and could not move onto a full 4th semester. I now have to return in September to repeat that class. I have made the decision to drop out of the program. Fortunately I do have a fall back, I've returned to my original career and have lots of work options. </p>
<p>You are young and school will always be there. We don't know what the fall will bring us. Hopefully in class school will return for all levels of education. Take this time to reflect on your career choice and the method you need to pursue that. I know this sucks and you feel like giving up on yourself. That isn't your fault. Try to rise above it, put the blame on the powers-that-be. Get angry at them not yourself. You are worth more and deserve more and better. </p>
<p>I have to tell myself this everyday to make it through each day. I miss my friends and doing all the things I used to do. But I certainly won't let them get the better of me. Who knows, maybe if we weren't going through this covid crap, you might be experiencing these feelings anyway. Take this time to dig deep within yourself. Nothing happens or changes overnight. It takes time. Just look at this covid crap. Look how things have changed over the course of 1 year.</p>
<p>I hope this helps. Take care of yourself.</p>

        <p>I dropped out of school so I could learn.</p>
<p>I started traveling, learning languages and reading books.  </p>
<p>The question I've always asked myself is if I want to learn, or if I want to get a degree.</p>
<p>And really, what good is a degree in Clown World?</p>
<p>I'm taking plenty of online courses now basically for free.  Same level of knowledge while college and university tuition fees are exorbitant to the point of being extortion.</p>

        <p>Finishing college will open alot more opportunities for you but If your serious about it, get a job you can learn from. Get into a trade or go to trade school.
Learning a trade was one of the best things I could've done for myself.</p>

        <p>I wouldn’t drop out permanently but I would take a break year until it resumes normally. Universities will resume normal when enrollment drops and the students demand normal. This will save your sanity and you can also take the opportunity to save some money to limit loans. </p>
<p>An alternative is if there are a few BS gen Ed electives that you can half ass to keep on track and still maintains good GPA go for that. Or take the class credit / no credit</p>

        <p>Same thing here man. I've been forced to move back to my hometown after sacrificing an insane amount to move in the first place. If I knew what this "pandemic" had in store from the beginning I would have dropped out immediately. Online school has none of the things that make higher education worth attending (and I'm not talking about partying, I'm talking about the personal development, human connection, and long term networking that comes with being surrounded by other students).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I had enough saved to buy a house in august from the summer job I had worked. I was seriously considering dropping out, buying a rental property, work all winter, buy another, rinse and repeat. Instead I was urged not to give up on education, it'll benefit me later, blah blah. Here I am feeling like every day is a waste and I should have just bailed out while I had a chance.</p>

        <p>One thing to consider if you hate sitting in front of a screen now, any job you get after college is likely to be sitting in front of a screen.</p>
<p>It might be worth considering a different career path.  I've been sitting in front of a computer screen for 20 years and its miserable and I want out.</p>
<p>On the other hand I've made great money for spending those years staring at a computer while a HVAC guy or similar has earned significantly less in that time.</p>
<p>It's never easy to make a decision like this and either way you go there will be challenges and regret.  Good luck.</p>

        <p>Have you considered transferring to a school that is operating more normally? I wouldn’t drop out unless you have a plan or prospects for feeding yourself and providing shelter. I would also consider heavily what program your in and what prospects it provides. Going for art history or philosophy, drop out or change plans... those among many many other, less obvious worthless pieces of paper, don’t provide financially fortitude. Going for engineering or bioscience, better prospects so dealing with a suboptimal situation may be worth it.</p>

        <p>I struggled with online classes when I was in college, so I can only imagine how awful that's been. Is there a technical school program you could do for the area you want to study? If you can do a technical certificate instead of a degree, that might be better for you, or faster at least, and maybe in person, depending on the school and program. </p>
<p>This would get you going on a career without staring at a computer for 3 years. Some are done in less than one. That's what my husband did, 9 months of school and he was working in the field he wanted.</p>
<p>Also, keep in a smaller school in mind. Do some of your education at a small junior college where things might be less restrictive. Look for a smaller town, that has a community college.</p>

        <p>I can't speak to your situation, but if it were me, I'd drop out and go get a job somewhere that can't be done online. Even with all the dumb extra "safety" rules it's better than no in-person interaction at all, and you're making money instead of paying to be penned up and isolated. Having a job that isn't WFH is what's keeping me mostly sane right now.</p>

        <p>what are you studying?  if its career track it might still be worth powering through, if its more of a soft science/enrichment type of degree, i personally would wait, partly because those degrees were already showing to be not worth the time/money before covid, and now its ludicrous to spend 10’s of k of resources on virtual.   its a tough time, and totally sympathize for your generation maybe more than any.   if you are a social person and interested in a particular skill, many businesses in your chosen areas of interest might still be open to having a young interested person be around to help, and from there you could learn a skill.   that said, if you are going more STEM then college is kind of the way, but other skills and trades are totally worthwhile without college and are great to learn young, so that by year 3 or 4 you are pretty journeyman and can always have something to fall back on.</p>
