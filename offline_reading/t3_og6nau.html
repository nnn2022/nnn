    <strong>Why are you so sure you are right?</strong>
    <p><p>So everyone here seems to think that there is some grand conspiracy that &lt;insert some opposition political group&rt; is trying to turn everyone into obedient little sheep by making them wear a mask/get a vaccine. Also, there seems to be the belief that the vaccine is unsafe based on anecdotal edge cases like some guy dying a couple hours after getting the vaccine.</p>
<p>This grand conspiracy involves the entire government, the media, academic institutions, and the most powerful/wealthy people in the world. So how, exactly, do you know exactly the will of the most powerful, intelligent, and wealthy people on this planet that are supposedly enacting some grand master plan to subjugate the world?</p>
<p>What if COVID is actually dangerous and they actually seeded vaccine hesitancy within the right to reduce their numbers (i.e. the liberal "sheep" get the vaccine and survive and live out normal lives)? What if the ultra-powerful took over right-wing news outlets secretly in the background (using their extensive resources and power) and spread theories that the virus is way less dangerous? What if the mainstream media is suppressing how dangerous the virus is (it might be even more dangerous than the MSM puts out) to get the conservative sheep to remain un-vaccinated and die out? What if the plan isn't world domination but to just establish a liberal majority in the US (which is far more practical)?</p>
<p>Or what if the virus is real, dangerous to a fraction of percent, and we all wear masks until we get vaccinated because we are decent people and willing to accept a small inconvenience to protect a (1% * pop. of US = 3.2 mil) small segment of the population? Maybe Trump downplayed the virus originally to save himself politically, the right picked up and ran with what god emperor says, it blew up in their face, and they have too much pride to admit they are wrong?</p>
<p>Obviously the last paragraph of questions is descriptive of reality. The prevailing sentiment on the right is that "everyone in the government, media, academic institutions, etc. are wrong about the virus and I'm right". Essentially, the right now believes that reality is a lie and <em>news sites that are specifically right-wing and takes everything Trump said as truth</em> are somehow unbiased and a correct reflection of reality.</p>
<p>So can someone explain their reasoning?</p>
<p>Edit: Fauci's initial position was that masks were ineffective. I disagreed with this because, from a fluid dynamics perspective, a mask inherently dilutes pollutants that are distributed non-homogeneously through the air through mixing. So all the right wing sites claiming masks don't lead to any improvement are wrong. Unless the Navier-Stokes equation is a liberal lie.</p></p>

        <p>Fauci said in a private email: if the IFR is in the range of 0.3 - 0. 5%, then it should be treated like the flu.</p>
<p>Fauci said in a TV interview: if the IFR is in the range of 0.2 - 0. 4%, then it should be treated like the flu.</p>
<p>&rt;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33768536/<br>
Conclusions: All systematic evaluations of seroprevalence data converge that SARS-CoV-2 infection is widely spread globally. Acknowledging residual uncertainties, the available evidence suggests average global IFR of \~0.15% and \~1.5-2.0 billion infections by February 2021 with substantial differences in IFR and in infection spread across continents, countries and locations.  </p>

        <p>Science is sometimes initially wrong. The goal is to keep moving closer to truth. And Fauci moved his position (on masks for example) and admitted he was wrong, getting crucified by the right for doing so.</p>
<p>And my point in the third paragraph still stands. What if they "leaked" word of a grand conspiracy to kill people, inflate numbers, etc. as a reverse psychology trick on the right in order to get them to essentially kill themselves? I mean the mere idea of a huge and widespread conspiracy by the liberal elites gets the right wet. So maybe the liberal elites leaked a false conspiracy to pull off this reverse psychology trick. I would say that is more probable, since that is exactly what I would do.</p>

        <p>They literally made up weapons of mass destructions to invade Iraq. They literally smashed a drone into the Pentagon on 9/11 and the FBI wiped all the tapes and threatened anyone who saw it. It's much easier than you think to keep things quiet.

        <p>Because the right wing media likes to push this narrative based of anecdotal claims. I live in a college town and <em>everyone, literally everyone of all ages</em>, has received the vaccine. No one has had an issue except for like an achy arm. And everyone knows one another too, so its not like the "vaccine death toll" is suppressed.</p>

        <p>No one has had an issue? Wait. It's impossible to not be affected by this. You now have hydrogel with metal oxide infiltrating all tissue in your body, including the brain. It never leaves the body because your body doesn't reject it. You are an antenna. </p>
<p>And that doesn't include the vascular issues that are unavoidable with who knows what the cells are spitting out. But we know that a high percentage of people are testing for presence of clotting even if no symptoms. Also, if mRNA leaks out of the nanolipids - which there are billions of -- they become prions as RNA is never supposed to be floating around in the blood stream.</p>
<p>This is not an issue of right wing media reporting anecdotal claims. These are well established confirmed physical effects by doctors and researchers and everyone will be affected. It is unavoidable.</p>

        <p>The sad thing is that if they were pushing Ivermectin instead of the "vaccine," this pandemic would probably be over by now. Ivermectin has been shown to be extremely effective against Covid.</p>
<p>But they don't care about other treatments. They just want people vaccinated.</p>

The injections - which are not vaccines cause blood clots, probably in everyone, based on the effects of the cell changes and hydrogel intertwined with iron oxide and/or graphene oxide nanolipids will infiltrate all tissues of the body.

        <p>Not everyone “is in on it”. It’s compartmentalized. There are also rivalries within large structures like the NIH, CDC or even secret societies. They work in overlapping concentric circles of influence.</p>
<p>Carroll Quigley described the existence of the Rhodes/Milner secret society founded at Oxford in this way. This society along with The Order at Yale have played a large role in medical research for over a century. AMA, CDC, NIH are all subservient to the Pharma complex controlled by these secret societies.</p>
<p>Johns Hopkins connected to Skull &amp; Bones since 1876, their first president was “Bonesman” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/lgs7k5/johns_hopkins_connected_to_skull_bones_since_1876/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">Daniel Coit Gilman.</a></p>
<p><em>Carroll Quigley writes:</em></p>
<p><strong>”This organization has been able to conceal its existence quite successfully, and many of its most influential members, satisfied to possess the reality rather than the appearance of power, are unknown even to close students of British history.</strong> This is the more surprising when we learn that one of the chief methods by which this Group works has been <strong>through propaganda.</strong> It plotted the Jameson Raid of 1895; it <strong>caused the Boer War of 1899-1902; it set up and controls the Rhodes Trust; it created the Union of South Africa in 1906-1910;</strong> it established the South African periodical The State in 1908; it founded the British Empire periodical The Round Table in 1910, and this remains the mouthpiece of the Group; <strong>it has been the most powerful single influence in All Souls, Balliol, and New Colleges at Oxford for more than a generation;</strong> it has <strong>controlled The Times for more than fifty years</strong>, with the exception of the three years 1919-1922, it publicized the idea of and the name "British Commonwealth of Nations" in the period 1908-1918, it was the chief influence in Lloyd George's war administration in 1917-1919 and dominated the British delegation to the Peace Conference of 1919; it had a great deal to do with the formation and management of the League of Nations and of the system of mandates; it founded the Royal Institute of International Affairs in 1919 and still controls it; it was one of the chief influences on British policy toward Ireland, Palestine, and India in the period 1917-1945; it was a very important influence on the policy of appeasement of Germany during the years 1920-1940; and it controlled and still controls, to a very considerable extent, the sources and the writing of the history of British Imperial and foreign policy since the Boer War. ^1</p>
<p>It would be expected that a Group which could number among its achievements such accomplishments as these would be a familiar subject for discussion among students of history and public affairs. In this case, the expectation is not realized, partly because of the <strong>deliberate policy of secrecy</strong> which this Group has adopted, partly because <strong>the Group itself is not closely integrated but rather appears as a series of overlapping circles or rings partly concealed by being hidden behind formally organized groups of no obvious political significance.”</strong></p>
<p><em>Antony Sutton writes:</em></p>
<p><strong>The Group links to the Jewish equivalent through the Rothschilds in Britain (Lord Rothschild was an original member of Rhodes' "inner circle"). The Order in the U.S. links to the Guggenheim, Schiff and Warburg families.</strong> There were no Jews at all in The Order until very recently. In fact, The Order has, as Rosenbaum suggests, some definite anti-semetic tendencies. Token Jews (and token blacks) have been admitted in recent years.  <strong>There is an Illuminati connection.</strong> Some details are in the Esquire article, more details will be in our future volumes. ^2</p>
<p><strong>All these groups have cooperative and competitive features. But to argue that all the world's ills can be ascribed to any one of these groups is false.</strong> The core of The Order, like the core of "The Group" in England, comprises about 20 families. In the U.S. case they are mostly descendents from the original settlers in Massachusetts. New wealth did not enter The Order until the mid-19th century and until recently, has never dominated The Order. On the other hand, key families, the Whitneys and the Harrimans, are linked to their own banking interests.</p>
<p><strong>In many ways these old line Yankee families have outsmarted the bankers. The Puritans diverted bankers' wealth to their own objectives without always absorbing the banker families.</strong> The Order controls the substantial wealth of Andrew Carnegie, but no Carnegie has ever been a member of The Order.”</p>
<p>“Quigley describes in minute detail the historical operations of the British establishment controlled by a secret society and operating very much as The Order operates in the U.S. This is the real significance of Quigley's explosive book.</p>
<p><strong>The Group</strong></p>
<p><strong>The British secret society, known as “The Group" or just plain "US", was founded at Oxford University, much as The Order was founded at Yale, but without the Masonic mumbo jumbo.</strong> As we noted in Memorandum Five, the Group operates in a series of <strong>concentric circles</strong> and like <strong>The Order consists of old line families allied with private merchant bankers, known in the U.S. as investment bankers.</strong></p>
<p>Bearing in mind the proven existence of The Group, the operations of The Order and the kind of penetration it has achieved cannot be explained by mere chance. <strong>By examining The Order's operations we can generate a picture of its objectives</strong> without access to any internal constitution or statement of objectives even if such exists. It may only be word of mouth.</p>
<p>By contrast, <strong>The Group's objective is recorded in Cecil Rhodes' will. It was:</strong></p>
<p>The extension of <strong>British rule throughout the world,</strong> the perfecting of a system of emigration from the United Kingdom and of colonization by British subjects of all lands wherein the means of livelihood are attainable by energy, labor and enterprise ... and <strong>the ultimate recovery of the United States of America as an integral part of the British Empire.</strong></p>
<p>This objective is, of course, ridiculous and somewhat immature, but no less ridiculous and immature than the New World order objective of The Order. Yet <strong>The Group has controlled British policy for a hundred years and still does.”</strong></p>
<p>“Unlike this author, Quigley sympathizes with the ends of The Group, although he terms their methods despicable. <strong>Both The Group and The Order are unwilling or unable to bring about a global society by voluntary means, so they opted for coercion. To do this they have created wars and revolutions, they have ransacked public treasuries, they have oppressed, they have pillaged, they have lied -- even to their own countrymen.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>”How The Order Relates To The Council On Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission And Similar Organizations</strong></p>
<p>Organizations like the Council on Foreign Relations <strong>(CFR) do not fit the requirements for a conspiracy. They are simply too large and their membership is not secret.</strong> The membership list for The Order has never surfaced until now. Anyone can obtain a list of members for the CFR and the Trilateral Commission. Also, too many people are included as members in these organizations who are just not given to membership in conspiratorial groups.</p>
<p>Certainly there is off-the-record discussion and certainly the general direction of U.S. policy reflects majority thinking in these organizations - but they are not conspiracies.</p>
<p>Moreover, the CFR and its sister organizations are not geared to action and implementation of policy. Compare, for example, the Brown Brothers, Harriman firm "with nine members of The Order and the CFR. Obviously the first is more cohesive, yet more low profile, more able to conceal its actions, yet more action oriented.</p>
<p>The larger open organizations are a forum for discussion, a place where ideas can be kicked around, "a rich man's club", as someone commented, "where people can be assessed, where discrete comment and criticism can be made away from a nosy press and a possibly unsympathetic public. They may not be elected bodies, but neither are they conspiracies; they fall in the shadow of a conspiracy. They are neither democratic or dictatorial.</p>
<p><strong>The Role of The Order</strong></p>
<p>The Order is represented in these organizations but does not always dominate. <strong>David Rockefeller, a former chairman of the CFR, is not a member of The Order (only Percy Rockefeller has represented the family), but the present CFR chairman, Winston Lord, is.</strong>
We can represent the relationship between The Order and the larger groups as a series of concentric circles. <strong>The CFR, etc. form an outer circle, i.e., a penumbra. They exist in a shadow cast by an inner organization. It is this inner organization that needs to be surfaced. The Order is the inner circle and Chapter 322 is a part of this inner circle because it is unlikely Chapter 322 is the only chapter in the U.S.</strong> We suspect, but cannot yet prove, at least one other.”</p>
<p><strong>The only thing we need to know is all the corrupt Pharma history I previously outlined. It still occurs to this day.</strong></p>

<p><em>-Newport West MP Paul Flynn, 2010</em></p>
<p>“You may have heard of the <strong>Libor scandal</strong>, in which at least three – and perhaps as many as 16 – of the name-brand too-big-to-fail banks have been manipulating global interest rates, in the process messing around with the prices of upward of $500 trillion (that’s trillion, with a “t”) worth of financial instruments. When that sprawling con burst into public view last year, it was easily the biggest financial scandal in history – <strong>MIT professor Andrew Lo even said it “dwarfs by orders of magnitude any financial scam in the history of markets.”</strong>

        <p>P.s. few people think the actual purpose of the "vaccine" is to "kill people". Death is simply a side effect, I don't believe it's the goal. Vaccine passports leading to microchips appear to be the main goal so far. They want to be able to track us like never before.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't be sure I was right if:
- They didn't manipulate the numbers every other day.
- If the tests wasn't easy to manipulate (Spin cycles PCR test)
- If people around me actually got sick and died..
- If I got sick..
- If Big pharma hadn't been busted for fake pandemics before.
- If <em>they</em> had been scared.
- If <em>they</em> had walked around in a Hazmat suit 24/7.</p>
<p>I can go on... But I have been sure since March last year.</p>

        <p>I do see how you have a point. A grand conspiracy is unlikely, and crazy if it was true. </p>
<p>But consider this: the government (in my country) has spent 400 billion dollars (that is publicly known) mitigating the effects of their lockdown and developing and acquiring vaccines. Imagine how much good that money could do if used to improve the lives of young people, or for example prevent people from dying from other serious issues like heart disease and getting cancer. The priorities of 'experts' are seriously fucked up if they think that preventing some (old, already sick) people from dying *with* COVID is what we should aim for at the expense of the future (children) of our country. What they have done is basically fuck over a generation because the specific problem of COVID is easier to measure than the complex and widespread problems (depression, cancer backlog, delayed education) that they have inflicted. Think about that for a bit. Most people on this sub do not deny that there is a virus that is deadly to some people, they simply question the absurdity of the response.</p>

        <p>This is a very reasonable. I remember in the beginning of the pandemic there was a good deal of debate about this, and the government's response to crisis should always be scrutinized. My original post was aimed at people who are the grand conspiracy types. Those that think asking people to wear masks to protect others (even if marginally) is the liberal elites converting people into sheep.</p>

        <p>Thanks. I think you'll find that even among the 'conspiracy' types there is a wide variation. For example, I myself believe that there is heavy 'harmonization' of science going on in a lot of major journals. My academic background is in epistemology so I know what I am talking about, basically there is another replication crisis but this time it is a huge challenge to really assess the issue because you would basically need scientists to look backwards instead of forwards, which of course doesn't equal money and funding. In the very near future, I think we as a society are going to have to take a step back and consider the implications of building on top of increasingly fragile science which is vulnerable to control by big money (think of all the studies paid for by Coke that minimize the damage of processed sugars), it's a house of cards.</p>

        <p>For sure, I see this replication crisis happening all the time in my area. Funding is really competitive and some of the less interesting but intellectually important details are glossed over. Then years later they get dug back up on accident and it turns out there is a problem with research built on top of it.</p>

        <p>I mean I thought it was weird that Bernie and Trump rallies were dominating politics and then were essentially banned overnight and the least charismatic candidate went from last to first because he was the "safe pick". Then the election process was made mail-in which consistently benefits democrats. </p>
<p>Like it seems like it was real, slightly more dangerous than the flu and the news played it up for ratings, politicians used it to send kickbacks to big pharma and big businesses while banning things they dislike (such as medical marijuana). Lockdowns didn't work and had lasting repercussions. Masks were effectively just ways to signal "I'm thinking of others". None of the large outdoor gatherings had spikes (blm, NCAA championship, super bowl, capitol riot)</p>
<p>I don't give a shit what you believe but no matter what happened the fact is politicians did not control or stop the virus... Not with lockdowns, not with masks, not with vaccines. Their guidance has greatly benefitted the pharmaceutical industry, blue chip businesses, and the teachers union while destroying nursing homes, small businesses, and students.</p>

        <p>I don't have to be sure. Even without a grand conspiracy; a virus with such low risk without several comorbidities, big Parma greed, government incompetence, and a rushed experimental gene therapy are enough to be highly sceptical.</p>
