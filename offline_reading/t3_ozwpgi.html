<title>Ostracizing people from society (job market, places of business, social gatherings, etc.) due to their hesitancy/unwillingness/inability to get an unnaproved emergency mandated vaccine is one-step away from putting them in internment camps or eliminating them all together.</title>

    <strong>Ostracizing people from society (job market, places of business, social gatherings, etc.) due to their hesitancy/unwillingness/inability to get an unnaproved emergency mandated vaccine is one-step away from putting them in internment camps or eliminating them all together.</strong>
    <p><p>I am from the United States and I am seeing many people who now hold this stance including in the mainstream media and the lack of ability for people to empathize or see another perspective is frankly disgusting. I fear for our future if these types of viewpoints will be the driving force in our society.</p>
<p>The amount of times I have heard people in real life and on social media wish death on someone who has contracted COVID based on them being unvaccinated is appalling. It shows a complete lack of class or character.</p>
<p>The absolute faith in the established systems some hold is terrifying. These people are literally putting their lives into the hands of corporations and governments who have storied histories of antitrust lawsuits, class action settlements, and consistent dishonesty.</p>
<p>No government, corporation, or media outlet has ever had my best interest at heart in my 30 year existence on this planet. The amount of bold faced lies I have seen over the years is countless. The amount of times they have told me to be scared about one thing or another is greater.</p>
<p>It blows me away that people cannot see why many are hesitant, wary, concerned, and untrustworthy at this point.</p>
<p>It's hard to believe that less than three years ago the standard procedure when someone was sick was just to avoid them till they were better and continue as normal. People are literally breaking up families and lifelong friendships over vaccine concerns and it truly is sad to see what we have become.</p>
<p>In conclusion. I am scared now. I'm scared that in the not so distant future we will live in some insane Draconian society where free thinkers are eliminated and you will be regulated and coerced into anything the establishment and masses order you to do.</p>
<p>Now is the time for civilized discussion with those you disagree with more than ever. Although I fear it may already be too late. Please have those conversations with your friends, family, etc. Keep it civil. Do your research. Do not sling shit or become angry for no reason. Level headed intelligent discussion is the only way. All anger, hate, and hostility will lead to is more division.</p>
<p>Stay safe and stay informed.</p></p>

        <p>It's coming man. The way this is painted is truly perverted, where in actuality, the vaccine is mutating the virus into variants, and both the vax and the disease are a mass genocidal plot, of the vaxx (through the vax) and these highly transmitted super viruses that will kill the unvaccinated. We’re kind of fucked, especially if everyone just watches the news and lives in fear.   The polarization of society will eventually develop into an apartheid state of some level, and the non compliant and whistleblowers will be put in camps. This will all ramp up into 2025. Then the next threat is the “aliens.”</p>

        <p>I had Covid as well in like April. I hope it helps keep me safe from severe illness in variant if I do contract one. Just covid alone has hurt my health, especially with general anxiety which I never had before this. My heart seems to palpitate more, and I get chest pains from time to time, as well as frequent headaches.</p>

        <p>Sorry about that. Hope you feel better. Covid sucked for a day until I crushed it with a specific vitamin regimen that no doctor would recommend. No symptoms after a few hours. Full athletic performance restored after a week.</p>

        <p>I agree it is possible.  During WW2 in Canada (and I think in the US as well)  the government seized and sold the property of Canadian citizens of Japanese ancestry and placed them in interment camps.  These were Canadian citizens, sometimes multi generational but it was ok because they were "the enemy".  If the unvaccinated are seen as "the enemy" by the general public and the government then why couldn't this happen again?</p>
