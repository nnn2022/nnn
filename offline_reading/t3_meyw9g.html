    <strong>A Rant: This isn't about a Virus but a global change.</strong>
    <p><p>Some people are having difficultly understanding the various changes going on around us, rules and logic behind them, well let me tell you this. If there is something you don't understand it usually means that you do not have all of the information or that you've been lied to. With that in mind..<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong>This isn't about a Virus</strong> but the use of a perceived Viral threat to initiate a world change, a global reset with a restructuring of society. Otherwise known has 'Build Back Better' and 'Order Out Of Chaos'.<br>
The contradictory evidence for this is all around you; From single direction walking paths' in your local park, to the banning one gathering but not the other. The banning of one group while the same people in another setting are apparently just fine.<br>
Notice how Church gatherings are banned but not plane journeys? What ties these settings together is communication. Communication on a Plane is usually limited to the person next to you, but else where? The gathering before the Church service, after the service. During the service the Pastor/Priest may discuss current events providing <strong>uncontrolled information</strong>. So this is about control of information, and in doing so slowing down the eventuality of people figuring this stuff out, if at all. You'll see other examples' of these type of discussion making all around you.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Then we have digital currency and the social credit system, both of which are closely tied. Imagine with the full introduction of digital currency along restrictive entry to <em>all</em> buildings, how are you going to purchase today's daily shopping when this morning your social credit score just dropped below a predefine threshold restricting your access to <em>all</em> buildings, restricting your purchase of all goods. And what did you do to deserve this? You attended a rally. You were involved in a car accident. You did not clear your garage/rubbish quick enough or it was left it in sight for others' to see. What are you going to do?<br>
This is the system that's being implement today under the guise of "Covid Passport", this is what this is about and how its use is imagined. This is not a conspiracy - it is happening today before your eyes. Accept that you've (and I) been lied to. It's okay to accept this as once we do we then move on from this; We begin to deal with it.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
How many more videos of those psychopaths' must you watch before finally accepting that this is real.<br>
How many more videos of outspoken empathic Doctors, Nurses, Surgeons, etc.., must you watch to understand that their words' are the truth.
How many times must you be slapped you in the face to wake up. How deeply asleep are you? When we sleep we generally are unaware of it but once awoken we then know that we had been sleeping. It's time for you to wake up, there are people waiting for you.<br>

        <p>I would rather die than live in that world but I agree it’s the direction the powers that shouldn’t be are steering us in. And I want to be alive. I’m not at all suicidal. It’s tough.</p>
<p>Creepy Alan Dershowitz released a video almost a year ago saying the government can “absolutely” enter your home and plunge a needle into your arm. I fear for the future and am more afraid every day. The only thing I feel like I can do at this point is pray, and I’m not even really religious.</p>

        <p>100% Agreed.</p>
<p>Ordo ab chao indeed. We'll soon get UBI, but that will fail as well, all on purpose though. Then they can say: maybe it's time for a new currency and a new economic system, because clearly the old system stopped working.</p>
<p>All part of the plan. Also see patent 2020 060606 if you haven't already.</p>

        <p>Maybe youre right. I still hope its just mainly idiocy and fear that put us into this situation.</p>
<p>But riddle me this: Why are Russia, Florida, Sweden quite easy on restrictions, as opposed to Ireland, Massachusetts or Hong Kong?</p>

        <p>We have to go on the offensive somehow (I'm not suggesting violence). There's no winning if we're endlessly on defense.</p>
