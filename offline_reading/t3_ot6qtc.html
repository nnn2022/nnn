    <strong>They dishonestly call us "covid deniers" or "anti-vaxxers" while the truth is much more benign...</strong>
    <p><p>Lets be real here. There aren't many people here who deny covid exists. And there aren't many who are broadly anti-vaccination. Although, there are some both ways. The polio vaccine was a godsend. Same for smallpox and others. You can believe that wholeheartedly and question this rushed to market covid vaccine and somehow get classified as anti-vaccine. </p>
<p>And from the beginning if you questioned any covid related policy from lockdowns to social distancing you were labelled a "covid denier". Quite the stretch and logical leap there. But thats the game. </p>
<p>The establishment and the people who subscribe to their narratives are not interested in the truth, let alone dissecting the nuance of various beliefs among people who question covid protocol. They are willfully dishonest. </p>
<p>All of this hyperbolic language people seem to naturally pick up and implement is a byproduct of our rhetorical habits in political discourse. Where people are divided into teams, every issue has it's respective team and we fight each other tooth and nail with no middle ground. It's incredibly reductive, destructive and harmful. But again that's the game.</p>
<p>The honest, more nuanced truth is this... From the beginning there have been various camps with different philosophies on risk tolerance. That is it. That's all there is to it. </p>
<p>As it stands now we have let the people with the smallest of risk tolerance dictate policy on how we address risk. Rather than attempt to find any middle ground, to focus on vulnerable people with targeted approaches, focus on decreasing obesity, improving help for elderly, governments decided we would shut it all down. Mask everyone. Isolate everyone. Vaccinate everyone. </p>
<p>There are various reasons I believe this latter approach evolved. Namely the fact government exploits tragedy to increase their power. And they happily team up with financial interest to do so.</p>
<p>But yeah, they will never have an honest conversation with us about this. Because at the end of the day this is incredibly complex. Every action has consequences in various facets of society from physical health, to financial health to mental health and to liberty etc.</p></p>

        <p>Well, I dont mind if you call me a "Covid-Denier". Because hell yeah I am.</p>
<p>A sickness that according to the CDC is not distinguishable from Influenza other than using a Test.</p>
<p>A Test that according to the CDC can not distinguish between Influenza and Covid.</p>
<p>:D</p>
<p>But I get your point. Even if it was a seriously lethal virus, there are limits to government overreach.</p>
