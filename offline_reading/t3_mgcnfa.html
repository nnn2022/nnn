    <strong>I wish the world put this effort into societal problems</strong>
    <p><pre><code> It really saddens me to see how quickly and easily the world could change and find solutions to a problem like covid, but there are so many more larger issues that have been around for much longer that they won’t solve. 
How is it that we all can unite and fight this virus, countries and people all in agreement to work together but then have war, poverty, and these other problems. 
Maybe this can show everyone that we could do it if we try but I don’t see many people taking this perspective on it. I’m not ignorant to the motivations behind the scenes on why this was pushed the way it was but still. 
If only we could take the sudden drastic changes from covid and apply them to obesity or mental health or something, then as we have all seen, VERY major change can happen very fast.

<p>I hope people realize.</p></p>

        <p>Nope. The world didn't even find a solution to covid.  I shudder to think what their experts would tell them to do with regards to the other issues you mentioned</p>

<p>Problem: virus</p>
<p>Reaction: everybody locked down, economy down as well</p>
<p>Solution: new world order, social credit system</p>
<p>The world's governments have no interest in fixing problems. They already have <em>their</em> solution ready for this 'pandemic'. It's all about the 'solution', but they needed a problem to force that 'solution' upon the citizins.</p>
