    <strong>Why do doomers come onto this sub? They've already gotten their way with masks and lockdowns. Why actively seek out opinions that anger you?</strong>
    <p><p>Most of the doomers that come to this subreddit seem furious that 9000 people don't like lockdowns or masks. If they're so sure they're "on the right side" why even bother. I don't go harass flat earthers or scientologists.</p>
<p>There are even multiple subreddits like "covidiots" that mainly focus on people who won't wear masks, etc.</p>
<p>Why are they so obsessed with what they consider a fringe minority?</p></p>

        <p>Because it's a cult with them.</p>
<p>They can't just leave us evil sinners to our own devices - they have to proselytize. I also think there is a strong component of "If I'm miserable and afraid, you have to be, too!"</p>
<p>And I can guarantee you there are a hell of a lot more than 9000 of us that long for the day this scam is exposed, and justice is done.</p>

        <p>We are here because we independently came to the conclusion that the data doesn't back up what we're told. The masses are listening blindly to everything the governments say without questioning it.</p>
<p>One of these things is a cult. </p>
<p>Argumentum ad populum is the logical fallacy that something must be true because the majority agrees that it is. Being able to question popular thought is not the same as being in a cult. When the data is strong, its not even conspiratorial to question the dogma.</p>

        <p>^ This is a key left/right dichotomy.  Leftists view reality as subjective.  If enough people agree that something is true, that <em>literally makes it true</em> for them.  In their minds, the role of science isn't to reveal objective truths about the world, it's to synthesize and interpret observed phenomena into accordance with their established narrative.</p>

        <p>No, as long as all you're banning is drunk driving. Locking down is like banning all driving for the reason that car crashes are an unacceptable risk even when not drunk. Not even addressing the question of whether legally mandated restrictions are any more effective, let alone significantly more effective, than asking people to adopt voluntary measures.</p>

        <p>you take a very large risk every time you get in a car. Anyone in any car around you could be your silent killer. You just don't know who it could be. But fatal car accidents happen all day every day everywhere. You'd better not get behind the wheel at all until we can get the risk down to zero.</p>

        <p>I'm talking about the risk you take every day that someone else might cause you death. You don't think twice about it when you get in a car, maybe you should. You're more likely to die from that than you are from this disease, but yet here we are. Go hide under your bed if you can't understand you've been lied to and manipulated into the fear, you deserve to hide there.</p>

        <p>I am not sure about long term effects, but in my research I found a source for UK car accidents (can't be bothered finding it again - sorry) that broke down the stats: It was something like there were 6 times as many <em>serious</em> injuries due to car accidents as there were fatalities, but I forget how many non-serious injuries there were.</p>
<p>So, assuming that this statistic applies globally, that means there are about 6 times as many serious injuries globally as there are fatalities: 1.35 * 6 = 8.1 million serious traffic related injuries globally each year.</p>
<p>I didn't look into what they defined as "serious", but I imagine things like loss of limbs or other lifelong disabilities. Still, any injury is obviously unpleasant and to be avoided, regardless of how serious it is.</p>
<p>And this isn't even considering illnesses and deaths caused by air pollution from car exhausts or lack of exercise because people would rather drive than walk or cycle.</p>
<p>Cars are a far bigger risk to our health and safety than covid is or ever will be and the information about how unsafe cars are has been known for a long time prior to covid. Yet it is only now that covidiots have become hugely concerned about enforcing anything that may (or may not) reduce the risk of covid <em>even if by only a tiny amount</em> regardless of the costs - socially or economically.</p>
<p>They're insincere hypocrites; social rejects full of spite that are relishing the opportunity to scream and shout at everyone.</p>

        <p>This argument is fundamentally flawed by the false equivalence fallacy. Getting impaired (by alcohol or other means) is a choice and driving after that is another choice (albeit one that is often made while impaired). Most of the people on this sub aren't going out and getting COVID by choice and putting others at risk, they just want to live their lives normally in a time when people are irrationally fearful of something that won't kill 99%+ of us. We don't shut down American society for  the flu which is a viral infection that has a similar IFR.</p>

        <p>Agreed. You make a choice to get drunk. You then make a(n impaired) choice to drive. That decision kills 11,000 Americans every year. Or as you would phrase it, a choice that won't kill 99.997% of us. Why do drunk driving laws exist?????</p>
<p>You're making a choice right now. When you don't wear a mask you make a choice. The choice to potentially be or become am asymptomatic carrier and then spread the disease to other people. That choice so far this year has killed 210,000 (inversely- only kills 97% of those infected!!!).. and you're all perfectly fine with there being NO laws to mandate masks. Even though it kills SOOOO many more people than drunk driving does every year.</p>

<p>I love this comment so much. It shows just how much you refuse to look at any facts, your main goal is ONLY to make my argument look bad. You're not really caring about what YOU'RE saying, because the focus of your comment is on me. Your goal is to discredit me, not to educate anyone or actually further a discussion. Simply just trying to make me look bad.</p>
<p>Ok guy, yes I've been saying 40,000 people die each year to car wrecks, but the actual number is 37,461 just like you posted. I rounded up for simplicity, but thank you for showing that my other comments actually hurt my own argument by rounding up. So anyway, 37,461 people are killed in automobile crashes. </p>
<p>That's a big number. A lot of unnecessary deaths, yeah? That's 1/6th (again I'm rounding, and hurting my argument for the sake of simplicity) the deaths of covid in the US (because your 37,461 number is US deaths only, not worldwide). 1/6th the deaths of covid. How many laws are there in regards to covid? That's killed 6 times as many people as traffic accidents? How old do you have to be to have covid? What insurance is required? When you cause an accident with me, you have insurance to cover damages, including medical. What if you give me covid because you won't wear a mask? My insurance is supposed to cover it just because you refuse to follow safety precautions? If I don't stop at a stop sign and run someone over, why is it not the person's fault that I ran over? </p>
<p>This is why we need laws. Because of these situations. Because people like you will refuse to wear a mask, carry it asymptomatically, then when the person who you infect (through no fault of their own) has to take on extra medical expenses, who's covering that. You? You absofuckinglutely should, but would you?</p>
<p>Would you pay the medical expenses of someone you gave covid to just because you won't wear a mask?</p>
<p>^ Answer that question.</p>

        <p>To be fair, YOU were the one who initially moved the goalposts to make /u/Snoo-68727 's argument look bad. That user agreed that he/she wanted freedom to choose what risks others were going to take for them and it didn't fit with your beliefs so you equated it to drunk driving to make his/her argument look bad. I just replied to show you what you already know because from your arguments you seem relatively intelligent, which is that they are not equivalent. </p>
<p>As you know, the laws you are referring to for cars did not come about overnight. They were passed over a long period of time as we learned more about the inherent dangers of automobile travel, different levels of impairment relating to it and a plethora of other factors. I would expect this exact same course to occur if COVID were to become a natural part of our lives over a long time. For instance, if we could actually track things down to the person who gave COVID to whom and pin absolute blame on them (like we generally do in car accidents) then I would assume we would see the free market of this country provide a money-making solution, a la the ability to obtain insurance for transmitting COVID to others. In that case, then I would happily pay for it so that I could live my life normally and be covered if either I gave the disease to others or have others with the option to be covered when they eventually give it to me. I don't want to beat a dead horse and keep going about car crashes and insurance because it's silly to keep playing off of that tangent when we should just hit the heart of the problem.</p>
<p>You and I probably agree on the most basic fundamentals of human rights and freedom, which is that we should be free to make our own choices about how to live our lives so long as they don't cause a direct and reasonably avoidable harm to others. It is the line of that particular distinction that we disagree on and that's ok.</p>

        <p>No, I equated wearing a mask to drunk driving and it's a good analogy. My drunk driving potentially kills you. You not wearing a mask potentially kills me. The numbers of drunk driving deaths are far fewer than covid deaths. Logically, we should have laws regarding masks and safety for OTHER PEOPLE because apparently people like you ONLY CARE ABOUT THEMSELVES</p>

        <p>Why are you ok with traffic laws? You can die from a meteor falling on you so we shouldn't have traffic laws. Actually kids should be able to drive, too. Kids can spread covid so kids should be able to drive. Who cares if the kids cause wrecks, there's so many other ways to cause wrecks.</p>
<p>You present yourself as reasonable, but what you're doing is taking my argument and making it sound crazy. Of course you can die in a multitude of other ways. There's laws to help regulate those aren't there?</p>
<p>And you do impose your decisions on me when you don't wear a mask. How are you so stupid to not see that? If you have covid, whether you know it or not, and you don't wear a mask, you are imposing that decision on to me.</p>
<p>You're obviously very young, but you need to think beyond your own eyeballs when discussing things with adults. You need to think that your life isn't necessarily the same as everyone else's. You need to learn a little empathy, and maybe learn a little respect as well. you'll get there</p>

        <p>Calling me a child when I'm very obviously not does nothing but undermine all of your arguments. A true adult would understand that there are people who have differing opinions and beliefs. For instance, I'm not very happy with several traffic laws; I don't think people should be required to wear seat belts in cars and I don't agree with the uninsured motorist policy. Those are invasive government edicts that protect private businesses (insurance companies) and I'm against the majority of government regulation in private business.</p>
<p>I have plenty of empathy and respect for others. I do not judge anyone for wearing a mask and I also comply or walk away when it is requested of me by a fellow citizen or business out of respect. I also keep my distance from everyone at all times because I don't pretend to know whether they are terrified of this virus of not.</p>
<p>I'm against government mandates where I don't believe they are necessary, which is in the vast majority of cases. Before there was a mandate in my state to wear masks, I had already done research into the efficacy of them to stop transmission of viruses (this was before there really were any studies about mask effectiveness vis-a-vis COVID) and I have continued to keep up with relevant research on the topic. </p>
<p>As for me "imposing my decision on you," that is something we will never agree on. I am entitled to do with my body what I see fit, and that includes wearing a mask or getting a vaccine for COVID if/when one becomes available or not doing those things. As much as you may disagree with that, I certainly would expect any reasonable person to understand where I am coming from. You are entitled to your opinion that I am selfish and you are free to express it because that's the beauty of the country that we (being presumptive here) live in.</p>

        <p>Why not mitigate your own risks? What more do you need than an n95 to take control of your own risks? CDC even says the virus is primarily airborne. Goggles + N95 would logically be sufficient to reduce the risk of airborne transmission.</p>

        <p>They also have 99.9% of the rest of the Internet backing them up. I can't even imagine the mentality of losers who are so threatened by little pockets of dissent that they feel a need to try to crap all over them. I'm sure they'd sqwuak about it being about safety and concern. Right. Maybe deep down inside, they know the truth and that is why it's so troublesome.</p>

        <p>It's important for them to have a caricature of a villain.  They assume we're all Trump loving, obese, not very intelligent, "Karens," racist, sexist, homophobic, selfish, etc, you name it.  If you browse /r/CovIdiots you will see how they break their arms circlejerking themselves shouting at strawmen who don't actually exist.    </p>
<ul>
<li>They believe that many people only refuse to wear masks because Trump told them to </li>
<li>They believe that the lockdowns would have been over in April if only "everyone had just followed the rules and wasn't selfish" </li>
<li>They actually like staying at home 24/7 </li>
<li>They lack the critical reasoning ability to accurately assess risk and prefer to "outsource" this decision  </li>
<li>They are unable to seriously comprehend how an individual could come to a different conclusion    </li>
</ul>
<p>The last bullet in particular ... I suspect that they come here for a mix of trolling "for the lulz" or they honestly believe that their arguments are so strong that they might "do some good" (because <em>they</em> "trust the experts").</p>

        <p>Bullet 2. Most of the goofy rules were not in place then and the majority of people followed the rules because it was supposed to be 2-3 weeks total.</p>
<p>But yeah, they do think if 100% followed the rules we would be out of it. Sadly, lockdowns only delay the virus spread. It is going to happen whether we like it or not. </p>

        <p>The last one is how most Americans "think".  If you disagree it's wrong, and you're bad.  More often then not you're a hater as well.  And the people loudest about it also love to crow about how they're the empathetic ones, or the critical thinkers, or independent.  They aren't any of those things.  They're simply told those are good things, so they tell themselves they do that because they took English Lit which they were so totally told was teaching critical thinking by having them read some book and write about how it would make [minority] feel.  <em>thats not critical thinking</em>. Critical thinking is logic and truth tables and facts and figures.  </p>
<p>I've long since come to the conclusion that a high school dropout in 1900 is far better at thinking than a university graduate of 2020.</p>

        <p>I agree.  I'll give a shoutout to /r/classicaleducation which I've been kinda self educating on (slowly) and that method will absolutely teach you how to think more clearly.  Reading ancient philosophy will clean the gunk out of your brain really quick because alongside the actual dialogues, you get a practical introduction to logic.</p>

        <p>A lot of it comes down to casual sadism. When you have a generation of isolated safety-washed young narcissists, it confers a lot of thin-skinned authoritarianism. If you read up on the authoritarian personality it makes A LOT more sense.</p>
<p>You notice when they come, it's to call us 'freaks' and worse. It's easy to bully minorities and it's fun to do it online. Kind of like how drone pilots have to dissociate their humanity as they blow up villages. You notice they don't come in with compassion, they come in with hate and a sense of unquestionable moral superiority.</p>
<p>A lot of these kids have had their lives ruined before they've even begun, and around a de-evolving populace, there isn't much space for true authenticity, so rebellion comes out in the form of trying to pull wings off flies.</p>
<p>The scary thing is, these are the people who might make great Nazis or religious puritans. Every generation has them, and ours breeds such deep contempt. They aren't here because we are 'selfish covidiots who don't want to save lives' they are just regular bullies, utterly powerless in their own lives, lashing out at those they believe to be even more powerless.</p>
<p>Classic human behaviour in modern form. Hopefully some of them can learn peace, hopefully the rest stay in their basements, and those few that become violent psychopaths get caught before they do some real damage.</p>
<p>I find it best to try to understand their sadness, judge their risk, offer compassion. Sometimes a bit of care can bring these scared people back around, some are just nasties that will become psychopaths and are best utterly ignored.</p>

        <p>Depending om where you are, we're not all locked down or wearing masks.  I think the majority of them are in places that are and are just waking up to the notion that the world is in different stages of openness and it makes them angry.  People around them might be waking up to how big an overreaction this all was and that's probably making them angry too.  They're the type of person who probably just always regurgitated out whatever msm fed them and never thought too deeply about what was told to them.  They immediately believe anyone questioning the main narrative is wrong because if something is popular, believed by many, and pushed by liberal politicians and talking heads, then how can it be wrong? This sub might be their only exposure to people who think differently than them and they just don't have the critical thinking skills to understand that we're not automatically "wrong" just because we're not going along with the majority.</p>

        <p>I think you’re right that they come here to try to convert us... they use one of 3 approaches in general: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>insults right out of the gate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>emotional appeal (don’t you care about others?) followed quickly by insults </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the reasonable veneer: they will show up, ask for a discussion, and receive (mostly) thoughtful answers with links to sources; they will nitpick any low-hanging fruit, refuse to even acknowledge any strong evidence or arguments, and then declare themselves “the winner” (often with insults)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve made serious efforts to have productive conversations with doomers, usually to no avail. They really, really love insults.</p>

        <p>I believe that the third category experience a strong cognitive dissonance when confronted with actual thoughtful replies, and snap under the pressure. After all, they have been bombarded with the opposite messages for months now and never questioned them. </p>
<p>I like to think that they resort to insults as a knee jerk reaction to the discomfort of the cognitive dissonance, and that they leave the discussion with at least partially shaken faith in the pro-lockdown propaganda. Who knows, some of them might even reevaluate their position later.</p>

        <p>I had a similar experience with a mask fetishist a while ago. He was demanding citations etc. so I gave him some, coupled with an argument. The citations were strong ones from highly reputable sources (e.g. the CDC) and in my opinion the argument I gave was equally strong.</p>
<p>But he never responded to my citations or my argument - he just went silent. Out of curiousity I checked his profile to see if he hadn't come online yet (maybe he had gone to bed) but I saw that he had since started ranting in the appropriately named covidiots subreddit about how mask skeptics weren't providing any citations to support our arguments and how <em>he</em> was giving super smart arguments instead. Naturally his brain damaged buddies - probably from the oxygen deprivation caused by their beloved masks - were jerking him off <em>hard</em>.</p>
<p>It was pure, refined intellectual dishonesty with more than a dash of science denial. The problem is these mask/lockdown morons have <em>convinced</em> themselves that they are scientifically literate and intellectually honest. The reality is that they think that the loudest and most popular scientific opinion is the correct one, and that by siding with it they are the smart ones. It's frustrating they don't realise how very wrong and how very dumb they are for doing this.</p>
<p>Mid-wits. They are the very definition of mid-wits.</p>

        <p>Absolutely. In fact I just concluded an amazing argument with one such moron, I encourage you to read through it if you want a laugh. It was amazing, everything he said was stupid, every time I pointed out why it was stupid, and every time he ignored me and continued as if he was the sensible one. The argument starts <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/j7irfi/do_you_guys_believe_in_vaccination/g854msy/">here</a>, I was arguing with OP, see his initial thread question to see what I was initially responding to.</p>
<p>The climax of the argument was when he cited a Mayo Clinic article persuading people to wear masks. The moron made the classic appeal to authority fallacy saying I wasn't allowed to question the Mayo Clinic because they are smarter than me, but when I investigated the article I discovered that it contained a reference that... wait for it... <em>said the general public shouldn't wear masks!</em> I literally did a double take when I read it. In their opinion piece why the general public should all wear masks, the Mayo Clinic cited a paper saying we shouldn't all wear masks. Says it all about these so-called experts, doesn't it?</p>
<p>When I pointed this out to him he completely ignored it, continued to make out the Mayo Clinic was infallible and persisted in telling me to wear a mask. Total brainlet.</p>
<p>I am not entirely convinced he was human.Possibly a bot, definitely an NPC. Absolutely a scientifically illiterate moron. I just blocked him in the end.</p>

        <p>I listened to the recording yesterday, it's scary how the officials shamelessly admit that there is no science behind the measures they enforce, yet the public swallows the infringements on their rights line hook and sinker. On top of that there are thousands of semi-intelligent trolls on reddit, twitter, and everywhere, who attack fiercely any attempt at civil discussion and restoring the normalcy.</p>

        <p>Most of the left on Reddit believe that rights derive from the state, and therefore can be revoked by the state in the name of "national emergency."</p>
<p>The Bill of Rights explicitly states that the rights within belong to the people, are <strong>natural</strong> rights, and can't be revoked willy-nilly because of the sniffles.</p>
<p>The fact that liberty-minded individuals believe more in the Bill of Rights than the whims of the state sends them into a goddamned frenzy. It never occurs to them that the left of their grandparents' time (the much-maligned "boomers" who went to Woodstock, smoked all of the weed, dropped acid and free-loved) would be <strong>horrified</strong> by how absolutely they are willing to suck the government's cock.</p>

        <p>I just want to point out that people who are on the fence or even skeptical or curious of our position are welcome here. Even pro mask/lockdowners who are reasonable and engage in well-intentioned debates. </p>
<p>Who is not welcome here is the "doomer". And when we say "doomer", we mean the people who catastrophize every aspect of our current existence and suck the life and meaning out of the everything in order to spread hysteria and panic, all while virtue signalling along the way. </p>
<p>No scenario has a clear winner: lockdown or anti-lockdown - as there are trade-offs in both. </p>
<p>So to say that one side is not only vastly superior to the other, but to also imply that anyone who questions lockdowns is doing so because of selfishness, recklessness and disdain for the community, is not only being manipulative and divisive, they're actually being incredibly narcissistic as well. </p>
<p>We can discuss things without resorting to threats of violence, death or name-calling. There is room for both arguments and none of them are inherently better than the other.</p>

        <p>This sub is weird. I absolutely hate masks, but I respect private businesses' right to choose how people behave on their property. I avoid wearing a mask as much as possible, but not at the expense of losing my job and supporting my family.</p>
<p>I'm opposed to the government forcing me to wear a mask, but that doesn't mean I have to be a jerk and upset or harass others, especially on private property.</p>
<p>There's also a lot of weird pseudoscience here. Obviously masks work in some contexts, otherwise doctors wouldn't have been wearing them for the past 100 years, but that doesn't mean every person needs to be wearing one all the time to stop covid.</p>
<p>Genuine question: why do you all act like masks never work for anything? Again, I don't support mask orders from the government, but I recognize science.</p>
<p>I'm asking this because I've expressed anti-mask sentiment here, while still being empathetic to doomers, and I still get downvoted.</p>

<p>Cause this sub isn't an anti-mask sub. It's an anti-dystopia sub.   <br>
It might be mostly anti-masks too, but that's a mere consequence of the weaponization of masks.    <br>
So, your problem was showing empathy towards people that are responsible for this problem and are at the same time criminalizing us for wanting our lives back.</p>

        <p>That's definitely a good point; the democratic check on power is real. I just don't see how empathizing with the sheep is a bad thing. Like if we ever want to change their minds, then we have to have some empathy. That doesn't mean we need to agree with them or feel sorry for them. Just means we should try to understand them.</p>

        <p>We understand sheep psychology better than the sheep do themselves. However, the sheep are with those who are in power. I would never empathize with those who support the oppressors even if they did it passively.</p>

        <p>Don't know if you will see this reply given it's 4 hours later, but I think this needs to be said:</p>
<p>I have have <em>no</em> empathy for the sheep. The reason is a simple sense of self-preservation, both for myself, and the society I live in.</p>
<p>Since we are using sheep here, think on this analogy.</p>
<p><em>If I encounter one sheep in a field, he does his sheep thing, I do my human thing, and we both carry on. If I meet 20,000  sheep in a field and they are stampeding, I am going to get trampled to death, even though the sheep are "harmless" and "don't mean it". But that won't matter, because I will still be dead.</em></p>

        <p>How long have restrictions been in place in your area? For 7 months can literally walk nowhere outside my apartment without a mask. Not a park, trail, sidewalk. Soon it will be a year. It's easy at first to go along with it but it gets really frustrating and I can't ever complain because apparently it's so easy. But man I miss the outdoors and the wind in my face, it's part of life. If my nose is showing and the nice fall wind comes across my face I get yelled at as "dick nose". So yeah. A mask is easy but I certainly don't have to pretend to love it.</p>

        <p>Actually if you were to scroll to the post where some guy mentioned seeing someone mowing the lawn with a mask a good chunk of us replied with the pro's of wearing one while doing certain activities. I for one wear one occasionally while out on our property in east Texas on the riding lawnmower due to large amounts of dust and small grass clippings. Interestingly I still have a bunch a crap come out of my nose even with the mask but not nearly as much without. I also get headaches when I wear one too long which is from minor oxygen deprivation. Most of us are reasonable. As far as the down voting goes it's just part of the territory, I've experienced it on covidiots when I am responding rationally.</p>

        <p>I agree, this sub is kind of weird; and sorry that you’re getting downvoted so bad. It’s almost like so many people don’t want to appeal to anyone peeking over, just to be extreme and angry. </p>
<p>Masks absolutely work in certain contexts and/or IF YOU’RE SICK. Forcing everyone to wear them is useless because without proper mask hygiene you’re just smearing germs on your face.</p>

        <p>I like to laugh too it's good for the soul. If covid were a truck and the fibers of a mask were a tunnel, the tunnel would be over 1 mile wide. </p>
<p>If you're scared of the virus stay home because people's masks won't save you. </p>
<p>We are going to need to increase police funding and enforce hard household radius like Australia (praise be upon them). </p>
<p>We need to lock the elderly inside for at least 5 years because vaccine may only be 50% effective and I'd say grandma is more valuable than that. </p>
<p>We need more fines and we need to give the police the power to make people behave by any means. Get serious about this virus people! Only one member of the house allowed to leave and for no unnecessary outings. . </p>
<p>My question to you is when will you break? When will it be a little too much for you and I hope people see you as a freak. The virus cannot be eradicated so try and figure out a way out of this.</p>

        <p>All those things you listed aren't enough. People here will chirp about how the tides are turning, and life is normal again, but it's really not for many, many places. I see people, including the mask fanatics, hugging each other and throwing BBQs because they are "rules for thee, not for me" hypocrites who'll happily obey the rules and police others if it means <strong>they</strong> can have their pathetic little niceties. </p>
<p>Clearly more needs to be done, but even many people in this sub are all too happy to just sit around and do nothing. Disobeying the mask mandates is a start, but it's also very difficult for many including myself because it is <strong>everywhere</strong> here. What needs to be done is more organization for our camp, and initiate more mass protests, and also education offline for those who aren't aware of the data and the potential consequences of the "New Normal", which is not easy given our circumstances right now.</p>

        <p>Brainwashed cultist thinks their masked dystopia full of bleating sheep is “our normal.”</p>
<p>I live in a free state and haven’t worn your little cult mask a single time. And I never will. And there’s nothing your wannabe hall-monitor ass can do about it.</p>
<p>Enjoy your pathetic little fear world, cultist.</p>

        <p>What ever man.  I live in a part of the country where everything is normal except for some masktards pushing their agenda on people.  The mask thing isn’t as crazy as some places and I don’t wear one anywhere.  So yeah, pretty normal here. Sucks to be you.</p>
