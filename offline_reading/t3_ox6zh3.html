    <strong>A little local research - we had LESS area deaths during the "pandemic" than previous years!</strong>
    <p><p>So my library records every obituary that is posted in the local paper (which includes our town and surrounding areas. Small town in a republican state, we "locked down" for maybe 2 weeks and then businesses were opening back up. While businesses required masks, most people did not wear them correctly in buildings. Obviously no one wore them outside.) along with age.</p>
<p>I went through our records, and here are the stats.</p>
<p>March 2018 - March 2019, 608 deaths, average ages 78. </p>
<p>February 2020 - February 2021, 592 deaths, average age 75.</p>
<p>I know it's just a small sample from a small town, but damn if this doesn't reaffirm my thoughts more that all this fear has got to stop.</p>
<p>Dont trust the news, do your own research.</p>
<p>Thank you to this community for being the last shred of sanity I see on Reddit.</p></p>
