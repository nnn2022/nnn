        <p>I don't know of anyone that has died of covid but I did hear about an older family friend that died from old age (several negative covid tests btw) but the hospital told them straight out that they want to list covid on the death certificate and they will give them part of the money that they will be receiving to do so. The family refused and did the right thing by having the real cause of death being listed, they didn't benefit off the scam</p>

        <p>It blew my mind that politics had that vanity fair hit piece up where they just openly mocked Trump for saying that hospitals get more cash if they tick the covid box. It's literally a fact. You get several grand if you treat a covid patient in addition to the usual medicare payment and if you admit them to the ICU you get like 12x more cash. </p>
<p>My wife used to work for a hospital system and the admins were constantly banging on about how to maximize medicare payments. They would literally run tests and conduct patient visits that were totally unnecessary just to get extra cash. </p>
<p>So if you think hospitals aren't gaming the shit out of these covid reimbursements you're a fool.</p>

        <p>It really is a separate reality. Same with Joe Rogan and the controversy now over his vaccine statement that 80% of people in clinical tries got sick. And the left is like FAKE NEWS CONSPIRACY THEORIES</p>
<p>Except that figure came directly from bill gates.... there is an interview where he says it right on camera.</p>

        <p>Absolutely dude, this is even something that even Trump mentioned in I believe one of his speeches! But it was widespread knowledge, it's $13k per patient that they "diagnose" with covid and also $35k each patient that's been put on a ventilator. I think this varies from state to state but I'm not too positive on that, I know hospitals get money too for each patient that passes away "from" the 'rona</p>

        <p>I know about the financial incentive, but I don't think there have been many caught-on-the-record examples of physicians openly, intentionally trying to falsify it like in your story. It's very likely it's happening, I just wish reporters would do their jobs and catch them</p>

        <p>Nope. Hell, the only ones I know who got the virus was my aunt and uncle (50s) out in Phoenix. They were fine a week or so later.</p>
<p>Hardly anyone where I'm from wears a mask or social distances. People live their normal lives every day and no one has gotten the virus, let alone died from it.</p>

        <p>Rural America - specifically, northern New England. Pretty much anywhere north of Boston. Went to a beach town in New Hampshire about a month ago where I barely saw anyone with a mask - and the town was absolutely packed. Went to a few packed bars there as well, and almost no one had a mask on and there was certainly no social distancing. Live music too. Even bartenders wore the masks on either their sleeves (as a "fuck you", I assume) or under their nose/on their chin.</p>
<p>From what I've gathered and experienced, most of rural America doesn't give a shit and more or less goes on about their lives as normal.</p>

        <p>Well each area is a little different. But I've recently been all over the state for the most part. Conway, Laconia, Rochester, Hampton, Portsmouth, etc -  and each place has been very lax when it comes to masks and restrictions. I went there for a bunch of bartending job interviews, and for almost all of them, they were conducted with neither party wearing a mask or social distancing.</p>
<p>Maine is good too, and similar (enough) to NH, but southern Maine is a bit more restrictive. Not too much thougu. Once you get into northern Maine (like Lewiston/Auburn and up), pretty much no one cares - like in NH.</p>

        <p>Maine representing... Their tightening up the rules here more... Deaths have been between zero and one per day since August... We just had two weeks with no deaths but someone died on October 31st so, ya know, gotta shut everything down again... Mills just ordered like 400,000 new test kits so I'm expecting even further restrictions </p>
<p>Old Orchard Beach was like heaven this summer... I'm not generally a fan of that place, but when I went  there were large crowds and no one had masks on... Even found a bar that was open past 10pm</p>

        <p>Can't say I even know the rules anymore. I literally just go about my day as normal at this point. Though I see relatively a lot of "Impeach Mills" signs around, actually.</p>
<p>When'd you hit OOB? I was there in August and found it was nice as far as it being packed with people generally not wearing masks, but essentially every business was requiring a mask to enter, especially restaurants. Went to one place where I walked in the door and was <em>directly</em> behind a bar stool and was told I needed to have a mask to come in and walk to my seat. Though I saw a store with a note on the door asking everyone to wear a mask inside so the police don't harass them anymore lol. Plus a couple places that big signs shitting on Mills/mask mandates. And there's one place there that doesn't at all follow the regulations, which is awesome.</p>

        <p>My parents (both mid-50’s) tested positive last week. My mom ran a fever and lost her sense of smell and taste for a couple days...my dad had no symptoms. Today, they both went on a four mile run, I called my mom and asked her if she had any shortage of breath afterwards and she told me nothing more than normal...</p>

        <p>Not directly, but I've heard of four cases that were written down as "covid19 deaths". Three of them died of heart failure in their homes, with no respiratory symptoms of any kind. The remaining one was a person who had been fighting several tumors for over six years, a very old and sick man. Again, he died at his home without any respiratory symptoms. </p>
<p>Even though their deaths were not related to covid19, they were written down as covid victims.</p>

<p>I met a guy who had it. I met him at my uncle's funeral, (My uncle died of cancer, not Covid.)  The guy's wife couldn't catch it with a mitt, nor any of his family he was under house arrest with. He's donating plasma for antibodies to use on other people. He thought he had a flu, and it was over, but they swabbed his brain through his nose and said he had it.</p>

<p>I don't know anyone who has died of COVID19 or experienced severe symptoms. The people I knows don't know about any COVID19 deaths or severe symptoms either as far I know. The only cases they knows about are from the news. We're dependent on news telling us daily about new cases, deaths and horror stories to sell and keep people afraid. Without news, almost none would've lived in fear. Why? Because of it's not the disease itself that's dangerous. It's the news trying to sell headlines, government trying to act bravely and so on.</p>
<p>I know about old people who are healthy and fine now. But if someone tells me they dies of COVID19 I won't believe that's the only cause. The likelihood for dying of heart attack, stroke, dementia or something else, in addition to something aged related is much higher. So, COVID19 would only be the little cherry on the top while the other things would be the actual killer.</p>
<p>Yes, getting COVID19 may be harder for old people. But the flu may also "kill" them. So, it's possible to be careful without these lockdowns and restrictions. They can get the vaccine when there's one and everyone else can stay at home when sick.</p>

        <p>My 70 yr old grandmother with stage 4 cancer went into the hospital for a heart attack/congestive heart failure. She tested positive, had no symptoms, and even had a chest x ray showing no symptoms. Nurse was saying that covid was the least of her worries. So odd to me that someone at such high risk tests positive and they say its least of her worries? My mother and I both tested neg and had no symptoms, so where did she get this from? Nurse emphasized that this is why covid is so dangerous because it's a silent killer. Uh huh. She's back home and fine now. If she passes within a month, we'll see what they list her death as.</p>

        <p>One woman.  70s.  Had end-stage terminal cancer.  Got Covid in hospital and it knocked maybe a week or two off her life.  She was written up in the Daily Mail (she used to be an actress) as someone who “died of Covid.”  They did not even mention all that at the time she died of Covid she was literally in hospital dying of cancer.  That was one of my big “wtf” moments re the media.  They literally painted her as a healthy woman struck down in her prime by this dreadful virus.</p>

        <p>No, and most of my friends are paramedics, nurses, care aids, etc. None of my family has gotten sick. None of my gf's family has gotten sick.</p>
<p>I asked my gf if she actually knows anyone who has died of covid. Yes - the grandpa of a friend-of-a-friend. That's literally the only time that a physical person has told me face to face of a person dying from covid. </p>
<p>Note, I'm not downplaying the tragedy that IS happening. It would be horrible to lose someone to covid. But in my personal experience it does seem to be rare. Hopefully it stays that way.</p>

        <p>Yes.  I know 3 people in their 80's/90's and 1 person who was 56.  One had Alzheimer's and was in a nursing home.  Her son wouldn't go visit anymore because she hadn't known him for a few years.  Her death was a blessing and was going to happen soon.  The other two were in poor health already.  One was put in a nursing home in January this year and actually died of pneumonia.  They only knew she was COVID-positive because of a test when admitted to the hospital.  The third wasn't in a nursing home, but did have heart issues.  </p>
<p>The 56 year old was morbidly obese (probably weighed 500 pounds) and had diabetes.  Technically, he died of a cardiac arrest, but I'm sure the COVID attributed to it.  The flu would also have been bad for him and possibly would have caused death to him.  </p>
<p>This all shows that we should protect the immunocompromised and the elderly, but the rest of us should go on living our lives.  If we're going to visit someone elderly, we can lock ourselves down for a week before the visit.</p>

        <p>Yes. He was mid-60s and had diabetes. He was a good man and would not have died anytime soon if it were not for covid. I myself had it, and all of our extended family. </p>
<p>That said, I still do not believe in lockdowns or any restrictions on daily life. All of life comes with risk, and time is a finite resource. Giving up a year of our lives for this is wholly inappropriate.</p>
